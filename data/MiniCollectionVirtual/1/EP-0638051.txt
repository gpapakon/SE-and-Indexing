<DESCRIPTION>
 ALKALI-LEAD-IRON PHOSPHATE GLASS AND ASSOCIATED METHODBackground of the InventionThis invention was made with Government support under contract DE-AC05-840R21400 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Division of Material Sciences, to Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. and the Government has certain rights in the invention.This invention relates generally to glass composition and relates, more particularly, to a glass composition suitable for use in glass-to-metal seal applications.In many seal applications, such as the construction of an electrical feedthrough involving glass-to-metal contact, the glass-to-metal seal must be vacuum-tight to maintain an effective separation between ambient and high vacuum conditions. However, the effectiveness of the seal could be jeopardized if the glass does not possess a high degree of chemical durability and a coefficient of thermal expansion which is high enough to match that of the metal with which the glass is used.It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved glass composition for use in glass-to-metal seal applications which possesses both a high degree of chemical durability and a relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, a method of making the glass, and a method for forming a glass-to-metal seal.Summary of the InventionThis invention resides in a glass composition and a method of making the glass, and an associated method of forming a glass-to-metal seal.The glass composition is comprised of phosphorus oxide within the range of about 40 to 49 molar percent, lead oxide within the range of about 10 to 25 molar percent, iron oxide within the range of about 10 to 17 molar percent and an alkali oxide within the range of about 23 to 30 molar percent.The method of making the glass includes the steps involved in preparing the composition. Such steps include the 

providing of a mixture consisting essentially of 10-25 molar percent lead oxide, 10-17 molar percent iron oxide, 40-49 molar percent ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and 23-30 molar percent alkali carbonate, melting the mixture together, and then solidifying the melt.The method of forming a glass-to-metal seal includes the steps of providing the aforementioned glass composition mixture in powdered form, melting the mixture together, placing the melted mixture into contact with the surface of the metal with which the seal is formed, and then solidifying the melt.Brief Description of the DrawingsFig. 1 is a graph of the thermal expansion curves for five glass

IN THE CLAIMS ;
Claim 1. A glass composition comprising phosphorus oxide within the range of about 40 to 49 molar percent, lead oxide within the range of about 10 to 25 molar percent, iron oxide within the range of about 10 to 17 molar percent and an alkali oxide within the range of about 23 to 30 molar percent.
Claim 2. The composition as defined in Claim 1 wherein the alkali of the alkali oxide is chosen from the group consisting of Cs, Rb, K, Na, and Li.
Claim 3. The composition as defined in Claim 1 including about 45 molar percent phosphorus oxide, about 15 molar percent lead oxide, about 10 molar percent iron oxide, and about 30 molar percent alkali oxide.
Claim 4. In a glass-to-metal seal application including a metal against which the glass is in contact, the improvement comprising: a composition of glass consisting essentially of phosphorus oxide, lead oxide and iron oxide and alkali oxide which have been mixed in such amounts so as to provide the glass with a coefficient of thermal expansion which approximates that of the metal against which the glass is in contact.
Claim 5. The improvement of Claim 4 wherein the phosphorus oxide within the glass composition is within the range of about 40 to 49 molar percent, the lead oxide within the glass composition is within the range of about 10 to 25 molar percent, the iron oxide within the glass composition is within the range of about 10 to 17 molar percent, and the alkali oxide within the composition is within the range of about 23 to 30 molar percent.
Claim 6. The improvement of Claim 4 wherein the phosphorus oxide within the glass composition is about 45 molar percent, the lead oxide within the glass composition is about 15 


molar percent, the iron oxide within the glass composition is about 10 molar percent, and the alkali oxide within the composition is about 30 molar percent.
Claim 7. A method of preparing a glass composition comprising the steps of: providing a mixture consisting essentially of 10-25 molar percent lead oxide, 10-17 molar percent iron oxide, 40-49 molar percent ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and 23-30 molar percent alkali carbonate in powdered form; melting the mixture together; and then solidifying the melt.
Claim 8. The method as defined in Claim 7 wherein the step of melting is performed as the temperature of the mixture is raised at a relatively slow rate to reduce the severity of foaming of the mixture as it melts together.
Claim 9. The method as defined in Claim 7 wherein the step of providing a mixture includes a preparatory step of preparing an initial frit of the lead oxide, iron oxide and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and then grinding the frit into a powder before adding the alkali carbonate to the ground powder.
Claim 10. A method of forming a glass-to-metal seal wherein glass contacts a metal surface in the seal, said method comprising the steps of: providing a mixture consisting essentially of 10-25 molar percent lead oxide, 10-17 molar percent iron oxide, 40-49 molar percent ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and 23-30 molar percent alkali carbonate in powdered form; melting the mixture together; placing the melted mixture into contact with the surface of the metal with which the seal is formed; and solidifying the melt.
Claim 11. The method as defined in Claim 10 wherein 


the step of placing the melted mixture is preceded by the steps of providing a mold within which the melted mixture is to be placed and solidified and placing the metal in a fixed relationship with respect to the mold so that when the melted mixture is subsequently placed within and solidified within the mold, the solidified melt makes the desired contact with the surface of the metal.
Claim 12. The method as defined in Claim 11 wherein the step of placing the metal includes a step of securing the metal within the mold so that upon placement of the melted mixture within the mold, the melted mixture is permitted to flow about the surface of the metal.
Claim 13. The method as defined in Claim 10 wherein the step of providing a mixture includes a preparatory step of preparing an initial frit of the lead oxide, iron oxide and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and then grinding the frit into a powder before adding the alkali carbonate to the ground powder.
