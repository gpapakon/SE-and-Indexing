<ABSTRACT>
A bending block for bending the rolls (5, 6) of multiroll rolling stands. On both sides of the chocks (9, 10) of the pair of rolls (5, 6) to be bent, the bending block (7, 8) is rigidly connected to the window crossbeams (1 and 2) of the rolling stand. In each of the bending blocks (7, 8), pairs of partial bending jaws (11a, 11b; 12a, 12b; 13a, 13b; 14a, 14b) are guided so as to be displaceable in the directions of bending and are driveable by means of piston-cylinder units. The pairs of partial bending jaws (11a, 11b; 12a, 12b; 13a, 13b; 14a, 14b) act by means of pressure bearing surfaces on pressure-accepting surfaces on the chocks (9, 10), each of these pressure-accepting surfaces being assigned to one direction of bending. Each pair of bending jaws consists of partial bending jaws which can be driven independently in opposite directions and the pressure bearing surfaces of which are each assigned to one direction of bending.

Bending block (7, 8) for the bending of the rolls (5, 6) of multiroll 
roll stands, which are fixedly connected on both sides of the 

bearing chocks (9, 10) of the roll pair (5, 6) to be bent with the 
aperture columns (1, 2) of the roll stand or devices for horizontal 

stabilising of the rolls, are guided to be displaceable in both 
directions of bending, have bending jaws (11 to 14) which are drivable by 

way of piston-cylinder units and which act by pressure contact surfaces 
on the pressure receiving surfaces, which are associated with one or the 

other bending direction, at the bearing chocks (9, 10) or the devices, 
characterised thereby that each bending jaw consists of a pair of partial 

bending jaws (11a, 11b; 12a, 12b; 13a, 13b; 14a, 14b) which are 
independently drivable in opposite sense and the pressure contact 

surfaces of which are each time associated with the one or the other 
bending direction. 
Bending block according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
one partial bending jaw (13a) comprises a cuboid or block-shaped housing 

which is guided by planar supporting slide surfaces between counter 
supporting slide surfaces of the housing
 of the other partial bending jaw 
(13b). 
Bending block according to claim 2, characterised thereby that the 
housing of the other partial bending jaw (13a) consists of two housing 

sections which are arranged at a spacing from one another, guide the 
housing of the one partial bending jaw (13b) therebetween and are 

connected together by a cross member (21). 
Bending block according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby that the piston-cylinder units, which drive the 

mutually corresponding partial bending jaws (13a, 13b) for the upper or 
the lower roll (5 or 6) of the roll pair to be bent each consist of a 

piston (16 or 19) arranged in the one partial bending jaw (14a or 14b) 
and connecting rods (17 or 20) to the respective other partial bending 

jaw (13a, 13b).
