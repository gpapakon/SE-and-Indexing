<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improved stent and stent graft for use in constricted body tubes, and for widening a stenosis in a body cavity such as in an artery, in the bile duct, esophagus, and so forth.Intraluminal endovascular stenting is a method by which a prosthesis is inserted into a body tube and expanded so as to reopen a collapsed vessel wall and prevent the wall from recollapsing into the lumen. Endovascular stenting is particularly useful for arteries which are blocked or narrowed and is an alternative to surgical procedures that intend to bypass the occlusion.Previous structures used as stents or intraluminal vascular grafts have included coiled stainless steel springs; helical wound spring coil made from shape memory alloy; expanding metal stents formed in a zig-zag pattern; diamond shaped rectangular shaped, and other mesh and non-mesh designs. Some of the stents currently available employ a self expanding concept, whereby stent expansion is primarily achieved by removing a restraint mechanism holding the stent in a constricted configuration. Other stents in the prior art are delivered to the site by a balloon catheter system, and primarily employ balloon dilation to achieve proper stent expansion.Problems with this variety of stents is inadequate radial force to maintain expansion; inappropriate scaffolding of tissue to the wall; pre-dilated longitudinal rigidity which negatively impacts on stent delivery; and shortening of the stent as a consequence of radial expansion. Pre-dilation stent longitudinal rigidity is a significant shortcoming, and prevents the threading of the stent through long tortuous vessels and lesions. Shortening of the stent is also a problem, as it is important that the stent cover the entire lesion to minimize the risk of post-operative complications. Obviously, therefore, there is a need for a long yet flexible stent that will provide the appropriate scaffolding effect, will be able to track well in-curved vessels, will not shorten during radial expansion, and yet will have sufficient outward radio force to hold the artery open, even in the presence of hard calcified lesions. The stent disclosed herein overcomes these disadvantages. No stent having all of the desired features appears to exist, prior to this invention which achieves most of these properties.As is well known, a traditional alternative to conventional vascular surgery has been percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, the angioplasty balloon is inflated within the stenosed
