<DESCRIPTION>
 DESIGN. CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF HT 1MANTZFD MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST HUMAN INTERLEUKIN-5The invention relates to nucleic acids which encode the heavy and light chain variable regions of a monoclonal antibody against human interleukin-5 and complementarity determining regions therefrom, and to humanized antibodies and binding proteins based upon the monoclonal antibody.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONInterleukin-5 (IL-5) is a lymphokine secreted by activated T cells which is biologically active on B cells and eosinophils. Because IL-5 replaces T lymphocytes in in vitro antibody responses to thymus-dependent antigens, it was formerly called T cell replacing factor [TRF; Dutton et al., Prog. Immunol. 1 :355 (1971); Schimpl et al., Nature 237:15 (1972)]. Because it also stimulates differentiation of B lymphocytes into IgM and IgG plaque-forming cells and the growth of B cell lymphomas in vitro, it has also been called B cell growth factor II [BCGFII; Takatsu et al., J Immunol. 124:2414 (1980)].Murine IL-5 consists of 133 amino acid residues, including a signal sequence of 20 residues and three potential N-glycosylation sites. Deglycosylation does not affect the biological activity of murine IL-5 in a B cell proliferation assay [Tavemier et al., DNA 8:491 (1989)]. Human IL-5 consists of 134 amino acid residues, including a signal sequence of 19 residues and two potential N-glycosylation sites. The structures of both proteins have been described by Yokota et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Â£4:7388 (1987)] and Kinashi et al. [Nature 324:70 (1986)]. The degrees of homology of murine and human IL-5 at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level are 77 and 70%, respectively. 

 Both murine and human IL-5 exist as homodimers linked by disulfide bonds. Therefore, glycosylated recombinant human IL-5 migrates in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of 40,000 daltons under non-reducing conditions, and 20-22,000 daltons under reducing conditions [Tsujimoto et al., J. Biochem. 106:23 (1989)].The cloning and expression of murine IL-5 has been described, e.g., by Kinashi et al. [Nature 324:10 (1986)] and Takatsu et al. [J. Immunol. 734 :382 (1985)]. Human IL-5 complementary DNA (cDNA) has been isolated using murine IL-5 cDNA as a probe by Azuma et al. [Nucleic Acids Res. 14:9149 (1986)].IL-5 has been shown to act as a maintenance and differentiation factor for eosinophils. In humans, the activity of IL-5 appears to be specific, affecting eosinophils primarily. Human IL-5 induces
