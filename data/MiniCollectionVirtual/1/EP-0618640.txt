<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to ferroelectric 
materials, and, more particularly, to a method of reducing 
the dielectric constant of such materials while preserving 
much of their inherent tunability. Four of the most important characteristics of a ferroelectric 
ceramic that are desired for practical microwave 
phase shift devices or electronically scanned array (ESA) 
antennas are (1) low (εr ≦ 100) dielectric constant, (2) low 
(≦0.010) loss tangent tan δ, (3) substantial (≧10%) tunability, 
and (4) stability of material properties over the 
operating temperature range. The material selected for a 
given application will, in general, be a trade-off, as not 
all of the properties wanted can be realized simultaneously. 
For example, by operating high-density barium-strontium-titanate 
(BST) close to its Curie temperature, a dielectric 
constant that exceeds 5,000 with 80 percent tunability 
is achievable; however, both parameters decline 
rapidly as the operating temperature is varied just a few 
degrees in either direction. The three most important reasons for seeking materials 
with dielectric constants less than 100 are: 
(1) Circuit dimensions and tolerances scale inversely 
as the square-root of dielectric constant. 
This adversely impacts producibility of ferroelectric  
 
microwave devices by conventional machining techniques, 
especially with εr > 100. (2) RF losses per unit length are directly proportional 
to both the dielectric loss tangent and the 
square-root of the dielectric constant. Typically, 
when the dielectric constant of a material such as BST 
is lowered, its loss tangent is also reduced. (3) Ferroelectric ceramics with a low dielectric 
constant generally have material properties that exhibit 
better temperature stability. Prior art approaches for lowering the dielectric constant 
employ three-dimensional thinning techniques, such as 
by inducing porosity in the ferroelectric material or by 
mixing the ferroelectric material with inert, low-dielectric-constant 
fillers. However, as porosity or percent 
volume of filler increases, the polycrystalline structure 
of the ferroelectric ceramic becomes more and more "disconnected". 
By "disconnected" is meant that the ferroelectric 
structure is no longer continuous, with the result that the 
applied dc electric field moves more into the pores or 
filler, which effectively reduces the tunability of the 
composite. The applied dc electric field can be raised to 
compensate for this effect; however, dielectric breakdown
