<ABSTRACT>
A compact apparatus for use in the sealing of water-carrying circuits in pipelines and vessels is described which serves to indirectly heat the sealing liquid and is provided with devices with which the sealing liquid can be directed through a heat-transfer medium for which a controllable heating device is available and can be passed in the heated state into the pipeline to be sealed and can be circulated therein in the circuit, in which case the apparatus according to the invention can be additionally used for emptying and drying the pipeline to be sealed before the treatment with the sealing liquid.

<CLAIMS>
Device to be used for sealing water conducting circuits
in pipelines and vessels by means of liquid sealing agents

containing water-glass which comprises an inner space (2)
within a vessel (1) filled at least partially with a liquid

as well as a heating device (4) in the inner space (2) and
a device (12) for maintaining the sealing agent/fluid circuit

outside of the inner space (2), characterised in that the
inner space (2) contains an organic heat exchanging agent

and/or water as a heat exchanging medium (3) heatable in
a controlled manner, and in the inner space (2) there is

provided a continuous pipeline (5) having U-shape for the
sealing agent, at least one of its U-legs being shaped as

a helical pipe (17), and that the continuous pipeline (5)
is provided, outside of the inner space (2), with an inlet

(6 and/or 10) with a shut off device (7 and/or 11) and with
an outlet (8) with a shut off device (9), and the device

(12) for maintaining the sealing agent/fluid circuit is arranged
in the continuous pipeline (5) outside of the inner space

(2).
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
a pressure supply (14) comprising a shut off device (15)

and a pressure gauge (16) is provided in the continuous pipeline
(5).
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that between the outer wall of the vessel (1)

and the inner space (2) there is provided a heat insulating
layer (13).
