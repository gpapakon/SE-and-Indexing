<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to gas separation membranes having improved selectivity
and recovery, and a process for making same.Gas separation membranes have been used for some time to separate a number
of gases from gas mixtures. A tradeoff typically exists between selectivity and permeability
Membranes which possess high permeabilities generally have low selectivities, while
membranes which possess high selectivities generally have low permeabilities.For example, in the separation of oxygen from nitrogen, while some membranes
have been reported in the literature to have oxygen nitrogen selectivities of 3 to 8, the
corresponding permeabilities are only in the range of from 100 to 0.1 barrers. Thus, the
recovery, that is, the ratio of the volume of non-permeate product gas to the volume of feed
gas, of such membranes is low, which limits the economic usefulness of such membranes,
particularly when a high purity non-permeate product such as 99 percent nitrogen is desired.What is needed is a membrane which possesses both high selectivity and
moderate to high permeability. Particularly as higher purity non-permeate product gas is
required, membranes possessing high recovery are needed. If permeability can be maintained,
membranes with higher selectivities are capable of achieving a higher recovery at a given non-permeate
concentration or purity than membranes with lower selectivities. What is therefore
needed is a process for increasing the selectivities of membranes which have moderate
selectivities and moderate permeabilities, without a corresponding significant decrease in
permeabilities, so that high recoveries can be obtained.The invention is a process for treating a gas separation membrane to improve its
selectivity,comprising the steps of:
A. first heating a dried membrane comprising a polymer having a UV excitable site
and a labile protonic site in the polymeric backbone, such that a covalent
bond may be formed between said sites, at a temperature between 60 and
300°C for a time sufficient to relax excess free volume in the polymer; andB. then irradiating the membrane with a UV radiation source in the presence
of oxygen for a time sufficient to surface oxidize the membrane to obtain a
treated membrane;
wherein the treated membrane exhibits at least a 10 percent increase in selectivity with less
than a 60 percent decrease in permeability compared to the untreated membrane.The invention includes membranes prepared from the above-described process.
Such membranes possess improved selectivity and recovery
