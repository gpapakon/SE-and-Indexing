<ABSTRACT>
A bottle carrier (10) of the type employing support tabs (20) at the periphery of bottle neck openings for engaging the underside of shoulders on the bottles (B). The carrier (10) is comprised of two plies (12, 14), each containing aligned bottle openings (18, 30) and each opening being surrounded by support tabs (20, 32). In one embodiment the support tabs (56) of an opening (54) in one ply are connected to the ply along fold lines (60) which are at an angle to the fold lines (64) of the tabs (66) of the corresponding opening (58) in the other ply so that the edges of the tabs engage the shoulder of a bottle at spaced points along the circumference of the shoulder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bottle carriers of the type 
that support a flanged bottle by tabs which engage the 
underside of the flange. More particularly, the invention 
relates to a carrier of this type which is reinforced 
against tearing or other failure of the tabs. Beverage bottles are conventionally formed with a 
flange or shoulder that projects out from the neck. One 
type of carrier that has been designed to support such 
bottles in a simple economical manner employs a support 
panel containing bottle neck openings which are surrounded 
by tabs arranged in so-called starburst fashion. When the 
panel is pushed down over bottles aligned with the neck 
openings, the tabs are pivoted up so that their edges 
engage the underside of the bottle shoulders. A handle, 
usually in the form of finger holes in the panel, enables 
a person to grasp and lift the carrier and its supported 
bottles. Because the entire weight of the bottles is supported 
by the neck opening tabs, they are of critical importance. 
If one or more of them are torn or missing, a significant 
portion of the circumference of the bottle flange will not 
be supported. The lifting stresses are then concentrated 
in the remaining tabs, and at times can be so great as to 
cause them to fail. Failure of a tab results in the 
lifting stresses being distributed more unevenly throughout 
the carrier support panel, increasing the chances of 
carrier failure. Various means have been suggested to reinforce the 
support panel, including the use of additional plies of 
material to protect against tearing. Although such 
measures provide additional protection against tearing of 
the panel, particularly in the handle area, the risk of 
failure due to missing or defective starburst support tabs 
is still a threat.  
 US-A-4378879 discloses a carrier package for bottles 
having a neck portion including an outwardly projecting 
shoulder, according to the preamble of claim 1 and 
comprising a support panel comprised of upper 
and lower plies containing aligned bottle openings 
through which the necks of the bottles extend, and a 
plurality of support tabs connected to each ply by fold 
lines extending along portions of the periphery 
of each bottle opening, the support tabs of each ply 
having edges remote from the tab fold lines for engaging 
the underside of the bottle shoulders. US-A-4378878 
and FR-A-2072659 each disclose a further 
carrier package and a blank for forming a carrier.
