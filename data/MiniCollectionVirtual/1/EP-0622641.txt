<ABSTRACT>
A sonar system (10) provided for mapping the bottom 
(12) of a body of water to identify a submerged foreign object 

transmits and directs a sequence of the sonar pulses toward the 
bottom (12). The mapping is formed from a sequence of echo 

returns. Each one of the echo returns is produced as a range 
scan in a range direction (16) response to a corresponding one of 

the transmitted sonar pulses. The sonar system (10) stores 
signals representative of the intensity of the echo returns in a 

two dimensional array of pixels. Each one of the pixels 
represents the intensity of the echo return at a predetermined 

range position from the system in the range direction (16) and a 
predetermined cross-range position from a reference position of 

the system in the cross-range direction (14). The system (10) 
quantizes the intensity of each one of the pixels into one of a 

plurality of levels, and compares the distribution of the levels 
of pixels over a range scan at a cross-range position with the 

distribution of levels of pixels over a range scan having a 
different cross-range position to identify the existence of an 

underwater object.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sonar system for mapping the
floor of a body of water to identify a submerged foreign
object, such mapping being formed from a sequence of echo
returns, each one of such echo returns being produced as a
range scan in response to a transmitted pulse directed
toward the floor in a predetermined direction, a sequence
of the sonar returns being received in cross-range
directions perpendicular to the predetermined direction,
such sonar system storing in a two dimensional array
digital signals as pixels each representing digitally the
intensity of the echo return at a predetermined range
position from the system in the predetermined direction
and a predetermined cross-range position from a reference
position of the system.As is known in the art, it is sometimes desirable to
identify submerged foreign objects such as mines, cables
or oil pipe lines using sonar. A common sonar type used
for examining the sea bottom is a Side Looking Sonar
(SLS). An SLS is either towed or mounted on an underwater
vehicle and is moved through the water in a forward
direction at an approximately constant speed and depth.
The sonar transmits a short (typically 0.10 to 0.20 ms),
high frequency (typically 500 kHz) pulse into the water
and has a very narrow horizontal beam-width (typically 1
degree or less) in a direction perpendicular to the
forward direction. The pulse propagates through the water
and reflects off the sea bottom, and the echo returns to
the sonar. After transmission, the sonar begins receiving
the echoes. Echoes that arrive later in time come from
further away on the sea bottom. The received signal maps
to a long, thin strip of the sea bottom and is called a
range scan. After a fixed elapsed time, and after the
vehicle has moved a short distance in the forward (cross-range) 
direction, the sonar stops receiving and begins a
new transmission. The length of the fixed elapsed receive
time determines the maximum range of the sonar along the
sea bottom. The range may be also limited by the sonar
power. Because of spreading and absorption loss, the
received intensity decreases with range (time elapsed from
transmission). This is compensated for in the sonar by a
Time Varying range-variable Gain (TVG). The beamwidth and
pulse length determine the sonar's azimuth and range
resolutions, respectively. As the sonar moves in the
forward (i.e. cross-range) direction, the range scans
correspond to subsequent parallel strips along the sea
bottom thereby producing a two dimensional "map" of the
sea
