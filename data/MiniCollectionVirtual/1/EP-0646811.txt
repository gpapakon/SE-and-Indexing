<ABSTRACT>
A breakout for a tube that is intended to carry 
optical fibres, comprises a body (1) having a channel 

(4) that extends along the body from one end to another 
end thereof and which furcates in a central region (5) 

thereof so that the channel has one outlet (6) at one 
end of the body and a plurality of outlets (7,7') at the 

other end. The breakout is capable of being stacked on 
one or more other breakouts and including one or more 

devices to enable it to be secured to such other 
breakout or breakouts. The breakout may be employed in 

optical fibre telephony systems where, for example, 
optical fibre bundles located in tubes need to be 

divided into smaller bundles as they are led into 
telephony racks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical fibre data 
transmission systems, and especially to components for 
use in optical fibre telephony systems. In such systems there are many points at which the 
optical fibres need to be spliced, for example in 
external nodes of the system, in telephony racks in the 
exchange or at the subscribers' premises, and at these 
points assemblies of splice trays are typically employed 
in which a small number of splices are located in each 
tray. In one system that is proposed, fibre bundles are 
located on either side of the splice assembly in tubes, 
and the bundles need to be divided into smaller bundles 
appropriate for the number of splices in each tray. In 
view of the large number of fibres associated with the 
splice assembly, it is important that they be managed 
neatly and efficiently. According to the present invention there is 
provided a breakout for a tube that is intended to carry 
optical fibres, which comprises a body having a channel 
that extends along the body from one end to another end 
thereof and which furcates in a central region thereof 
so that the channel has one outlet at one end of the 
body and a plurality of outlets at the other end of the 
body, the breakout being capable of being stacked on one 
or more other breakouts and including one or more  
 
devices to enable it to be secured to such other 
breakout or breakouts. The breakouts according to the invention can 
conveniently be employed for conveying fibres to and 
from splice assemblies and can be stacked so that a 
large number of fibres can be handled in a relatively 
small space. Preferably, the central region of the channel is 
accessible from a surface of the body in order to 
facilitate laying up of the fibres exiting from the tube 
at one end of the body into the correct tubes at the 
other end. In this case the body may be provided with a 
cover to enclose the central region and protect that 
length of the fibres not located in the tubes after the 
laying up operation has been completed. Three forms of breakout according to the invention 
will now be described by way of example with reference 
to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figures 1a to 1care perspective views of a one-in-two-out 
breakout shown from 
various directions; Figures 2a to 2care perspective views of a one-in-four-out 
breakout shown from 
various directions; and Figures 3a to 3care perspective views of a second 
form of one-in-two-out breakout 
shown from various directions. Referring to the accompanying

A breakout as claimed in claim 1, wherein at least 
the central region of the channel is accessible from a 

surface of the body. 
A breakout as claimed in claim 2, which includes a 
cover that can be secured to the body to enclose the 

central region of the channel. 
A breakout as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
cover is transparent. 
A breakout as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the body includes one or more pins and 

corresponding recesses to enable correct alignment with 
the other breakout or breakouts. 
A breakout as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the channel furcates into two outlets. 
A breakout as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the channel furcates into four outlets. 
A breakout as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein each outlet of the channel has means for 

resisting a tube inserted therein being pulled out.
