<ABSTRACT>
A method for aiding in the diagnosis of, and monitoring the 
progression or course of, colon cancer in a patient by measuring the 

amount of NCA 50/90 in a blood sample, e.g., serum sample, 
obtained from the patient. Measurement in a single sample of an 

amount of NCA 50/90 significantly higher than the mean amount of 
NCA 50/90 in the normal population is an indication of colon cancer 

in a symptomatic patient. The course of colon cancer can also be 
monitored by performing a series of specific immunoassays over time 

to determine changes in the level of NCA 50/90 in blood samples. 
Increases in blood NCA 50/90 levels over time are indicative of a 

deteriorating condition whereas decreasing levels of blood NCA 50/90 

over time indicate an improving condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the diagnosis of, and
monitoring the progression, course, or stage of, disease in colon
cancer patients. More particularly, the invention relates to such
diagnostic and monitoring methods based on measurement of cancer
marker blood levels.A number of substances have been determined to be useful
markers in monitoring the course of various cancer types. Some
useful markers that have been identified are oncofetal antigens such as
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha-fetoprotein, tissue-specific
antigens such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and mucin antigers
such as those conventionally known as CA-125 and CA-19-9. 
Immunoassays for antigens such as these are typically used as
confirmatory tests at the time of diagnosis and subsequently for
monitoring patient status. Occasionally, the use of such tests crosses
the boundaries of tumor type (for example, the use of CEA tests in
colon, breast, and lung cancer, and alpha-fetoprotein in hepatocellular
and testicular cancer), but the utility of each test type is foremost for a
single tumor type (for example, PSA for prostate cancer and CA-125
for ovarian cancer).A family of antigenic proteins have been identified which are
genetically and immunologically related to CEA (Thompson, J. and
W. Zimmerman (1988) Tumor Biol. 9, 63-83; and Barnett, T. and W.
Zimmerman (1990) Tumor Biol. 11, 59-63). Among these are the
nonspecific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs), the trans-membrane
antigens designated biliary glycoprotein (BGP, and sometimes referred
to as TM-CEAs), and the family of pregnancy-specific Î²-glycoproteins
(PSGs) (for a description of the accepted nomenclature of these genes
and their protein products, reference can be made to: Barnett, T. and
W. Zimmerman (1990) Tumor Biol. 11, 59-63). Molecular cloning of
the CEA gene family has enabled the identification of 22 members, of
which 20 are probably expressed (Frangsmyr, L. et al. (1992) Tumor
Biol. 13, 98-99; and Hammerstrom, S. et al Tumor Biol. 13, 57).
The results of molecular genetic analysis have given a better
understanding of the complex group of glycoproteins in the CEA gene
family.NCA was originally described as a component of normal tissue
which cross-reacted with antibodies raised to CEA (Mach, J.-P. and 
G. Pusztaszeri (1972) Immunochemistry 9, 1031-1034; and von Kleist,
S., Chavenel, G. and P. Burtin (1972) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
69, 2492-2494). As such, NCA was considered a potential non-tumor
derived interferant in assays for CEA. Molecular cloning

<CLAIMS>
A method for monitoring the course of disease in a patient
diagnosed with colon cancer, comprising performance of a series of

specific immunoassays over time to determine changes in the level
of NCA 50/90 in blood samples obtained from such patient,

whereby changes in the NCA 50/90 blood level correlate with
changes in disease status.
A method for monitoring the course of disease in a patient
diagnosed with colon cancer, comprising the performance of a

series of specific immunoassays over time to determine changes in
the level of NCA 50/90 in blood samples obtained from such

patient, whereby increases in blood NCA 50/90 levels indicate a
deteriorating condition while decreases in blood NCA 50/90 levels

indicate an improving condition.
A method for monitoring the course of disease in a patient who has
been treated for colon cancer, comprising the performance of a

series of specific immunoassays over time to determine changes in
the level of NCA 50/90 in blood samples obtained from such

patient, whereby increases in blood NCA 50/90 levels indicate
recurrence of disease.
The method of any one of claims 1-3 wherein the immunoassays
performed are sandwich immunoassays in which at least one of the

antibody reagents is specific for NCA 50/90 with no substantial
reactivity for CEA, NCA 95, or BGP.
The method of claim 4 wherein said NCA 50/90 specific antibody
reagent is a monoclonal antibody reagent.
The method of claim 5 wherein said NCA 50/90 specific antibody
reagent binds substantially to the same epitope as the monoclonal

antibody produced by the hybridoma deposited with the American
Type Culture Collection and identified as ATCC HB11204.
The method of any one of claims 1-3 wherein said blood samples
are serum or plasma samples.
