<ABSTRACT>
In the case of known support insulators having a capacitive voltage divider and overvoltage suppressor, the problem, inter alia, arises of indicating the disconnection of the medium-voltage or high-voltage line which is held on the support insulator. In this case, climatic factors and other factors can adversely affect the insulation of the measurement line and a disconnection which has not been carried out can possibly be simulated. To this end, the invention provides that both the coupling capacitance and the overvoltage suppressor, which is connected in series with the coupling capacitance, are installed in the insulating body. The invention can be used for support insulators of any type.
