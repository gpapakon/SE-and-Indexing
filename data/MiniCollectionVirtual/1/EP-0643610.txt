<ABSTRACT>
An in line liquid/gas separator for use in a liquid/gas supply pipe. The separator having a first drain (8) for draining liquid which has undergone preliminary separation, a plurality of fixed vanes (15, 16) downstream of the first drain for swirling the liquid/gas mixture, and a second drain (9) downstream of the vanes to drain liquid which has been separated by the vanes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for separating liquid contained in a liquid/gas 
mixture. Gas extracted from a well is commonly contaminated by 
liquid which has to be removed. Drying facilities are 
conventionally provided at the production site to perform 
this removal. However, space on the production site is at 
a premium. Further, any breakdown or maintenance which 
causes the separator to be out of use may reduce the 
capacity of the site. DE-A-2458819 discloses a liquid/gas separator 
comprising a pipe section having an inlet, for 
connection to an upstream part of a liquid/gas supply pipe, 
and an outlet, for connection to a downstream part of 
the supply pipe, the pipe section containing a first drain, 
for draining liquid which has undergone preliminary 
separation, a plurality of fixed vanes located downstream of the 
first drain, to swirl the liquid/gas 
mixture to cause further separation, and a second drain located 
downstream of the vanes, to separate the liquid which has 
undergone the further separation, such that gas 
which is substantially free of liquid can leave the separator 
through the outlet. According to the present invention, 
such a separator is characterised in that the fixed vanes 
comprise a radially outer set and a radially inner set of vanes, 
arranged in parallel, each set being symmetrically disposed 
around the axis of the pipe section. The separator of the present invention being housed 
within a pipe section can be fitted into a conventional 
supply pipe. The space needed for the separator is 
therefore minimal. The separator need have no moving parts 
and therefore has excellent reliability and needs little 
maintenance. The vanes are inclined in the direction of the  
 
flow of the liquid/gas mixture and are circumferentially 
inclined. The radially outer set of vanes preferably 
comprises more vanes than the radially inner set of vanes. 
Also, the radially outer set of vanes are preferably 
inclined at a steeper angle with respect to the axis of the 
pipe. The inlet of the pipe section is preferably flared in 
the direction of flow of the liquid/gas mixture. This 
causes the mixture to undergo the preliminary separation. To improve the drainage of the liquid from the 
separator, a third drain may be provided adjacent to the 
vanes. The drains preferably lead into a common tank. 
Advantageously, means are provided to monitor and control 
the level of liquid in the tank. More than one of the above described separators may be 
provided in

<CLAIMS>
A liquid/gas separator comprising a pipe section (1) 
having an inlet, for connection to an upstream part (2) 

of a liquid/gas supply pipe, and an outlet, for 
connection to a downstream part (3) of the supply pipe, the 

pipe section containing a first drain (8), for draining 
liquid which has undergone preliminary separation, a 

plurality of fixed vanes (15,16) located downstream of the first 
drain, to swirl the liquid/gas mixture to 

cause further separation, and a second drain (9) located downstream 
of the vanes, to separate the liquid which has undergone the 

further separation, such that gas which is 
substantially free of liquid can leave the separator through 

the outlet; characterised in that the fixed vanes comprise 
a radially outer (16) set and a radially inner (15) set of vanes, 

arranged in parallel, each set being symmetrically disposed 
around the axis of the pipe section. 
A separator according to claim 1, wherein the radially 
outer set of vanes (16) comprises more vanes than the 

radially inner set of vanes (15). 
A separator according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the vanes (15,16) are inclined in the direction of the flow 

of the liquid/gas mixture and are circumferentially 
inclined. 
A separator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the radially outer set of vanes (16) are 

inclined at a steeper angle than the inner set of vanes 
(15) with respect to the axis of the pipe. 
A separator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the inlet of the pipe section is flared in 

the direction of flow of the liquid/gas mixture.  
 
A separator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein a third drain (14) is provided adjacent to 

the vanes (15,16). 
A separator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the drains (8,9,14) lead into a common tank 

(21). 
A separator according to claim 7, wherein means 
(22,23) are provided to monitor and control the level of 

liquid in the tank. 
A separator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein a concentric reducer (5) is provided 

downstream of the vanes (15,16). 
A separator according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein a tubular sleeve (11) is provided 

adjacent to each drain (8,9), to trap the liquid flowing at 
the radially outer portion of the pipe section (1) and 

guide it towards the respective drain (8,9). 
A system for separating liquid and gas comprising more 
than one separator, according to any one of the preceding 

claims, connected in series.
