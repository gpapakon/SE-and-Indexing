<ABSTRACT>
A reverse-polarity protection is disclosed for coupling an electric circuit (2) to an energy and information conducting conductor system (3). At least one coupling path (5) comprises a controllable element (4) as reverse-polarity protection. When an emitter circuit (2) is inductively coupled to the conductor system (3) by means of a converter (6), the working current flows through the winding (7) at the emitter side and through the control electrode of the controllable element, the so-called reverse-polarity protection element (4).

Polarity-reversal protection for coupling an 
electric circuit arrangement (2) to a conductor system 

(3) which conducts energy and information, wherein at 
least one coupling path (5) comprises a controllable 

element (4) as polarity-reversal protection, 
characterised in that when a transmitting circuit 

arrangement (2) is inductively coupled to the conductor 
system (3) by means of a transformer (6) the working 

current, which flows by way of the winding (7) on the 
transmitting side, is conducted by way of the control 

electrode of the controllable element, called polarity-reversal 
protection element (4). 
Polarity-reversal protection for coupling an 
electric circuit arrangement (2) to a conductor system 

(3) which conducts direct-current energy and 
alternating-voltage information, wherein at least one 

coupling path (5) comprises a controllable element (4) 
as polarity-reversal protection, for which purpose this 

polarity-reversal protection element (4) blocks or 
frees the coupling path (5) as a function of the 

polarity of the conductor system (3), characterised in 
that when the transmitting circuit arrangement (2) is 

inductively coupled to the conductor system (3) by 
means of a transformer (6), which in conjunction with a 

capacitor (11) is used as a switch for direct-current 
energy and for alternating-voltage information, the 

working current, which flows by way of the winding of 
the transformer (6) that is used as a transmitting 

winding (7), is conducted by way of the control 
electrode of the polarity-reversal protection element 

(4), wherein the capacitor (11) is arranged in a line 
in whose run there lies a working electrode, for 

example the emitter, of the polarity-reversal 
protection element (4), and a further coupling path 

(18) for the transmitting current is directed to the  
 

control electrode of the polarity-reversal protection 
element (4). 
Polarity-reversal protection according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the polarity-reversal 

protection element (4) is a symmetrical 
double-emitter-transistor (17), the control input of 

which is connected to a driving-control circuit 
arrangement (18) (sic) in addition to being connected 

to the line for transmitting current.
