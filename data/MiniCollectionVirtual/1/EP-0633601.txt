<ABSTRACT>
If ions transverse inhomogenous fields in the detector of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, the case can arise that different flight paths (11) require different times from the entry window up to the ion-electron conversion surface (3). These flight-time distortions can be reduced by suitable deformation of the conversion surface (3).

A detector according to claim 1, with a microchannel plate as
ion-electron conversion surface(3).

A method of operating a detector of a time-of-flight mass-spectrometer,
that


has a number of electrodes(1,2,4) for postaccelerating ions,
and
an ion-electron conversion surface(3) that is not flat,
characterized
 by

an ion-electron conversion surface(3), which is not flat,
the curvature of the ion-electron conversion surface(3) reducing
flight-time errors of the ions, and
the fact that the off-axis ion paths(11) are so strongly bent
toward the ion optical axis by the electrodes(1,2,4) and their

A method of determining the curvature of the ion-electron conversion
surface(3) of a detector having a number of electrodes(1,2,4),

comprising the steps of:

a) fixing all forms of the electrodes(1,2,4), except the curvature
of the ion-electrode conversion surface(3),
b) to start with, fixing the ion-electron conversion surface(3) to
some convenient form,
c) fixing the voltages of all electrodes(1,2,4) 
d) determining the potential from the given electrode-forms and
-voltages,
e) determining a number of paths(11) into the detector, either

starting from a reference plane(12) normal to the ion optical
axis, parallel to the ion optical axis with the same

initial velocity, or
starting from the ion source of the time-of-flight mass
spectrometer, choosing paths with initial conditions corresponding

to normal operation of the mass spectrometer,

taking for all paths the same flight time, which is the time that
an ion needs from the reference plane(12) i.e. the ion source

of the time-of-flight mass spectrometer to the conversion surface(3),
said ion flying on the ion optical axis,
f) the surface(20),

in case of two dimensional initial conditions for the determined
paths, being defined the endpoints of the previously

determined paths(11),
in case of more than two dimensional initial conditions
for the determined paths, being defined by a plane most

closely approximating all the the endpoints of the previously
determined paths(11),

being the necessary form of the ion-electron conversion surface,
g) taking the surface(20) determined in step f) either

exactly as the new form for the conversion surface(3), or
approximate this surface by an expansion defined by a
finite number of parameters,
 
and continue at step d),

repeating step d) through f) until the difference between the surface(20)
determined in step f) and the actual conversion surface(3)

falls below some predetermined limit, whereas if a finite expansion
is used to define the new converion surface in step (g, then at least

that number of parameters for the determination of the conversion
surface(3) should be used that allows the difference between the

surface(20) determined in step f) and the actual conversion surface(3)
to fall below some predetermined limit.
Method for determining the electrode voltages of a detector, comprising
the steps of:


a) fixing all forms of the electrodes(1,2,4),
b) selecting a set of voltages for the electrodes,
c) determining the potential from the electrode-forms and -voltages
given,
d) determining a number of paths(11) into the detector, either

starting from a reference plane(12 normal to the ion optical
axis, parallel to the ion optical axis with the same

initial velocity, or
starting from the ion source of the time-of-flight mass
spectrometer, choosing paths with initial conditions corresponding

to normal operation of the mass spectrometer,

taking for all paths the same flight time, which is the time that
an ion needs from the reference plane(12) i.e. the ion source

of the time-of-flight mass spectrometer to the conversion surface(3),
said ion flying on the ion optical axis, 
e) and modifying the electrode voltages such as to minimize the
difference between surface defined by the endpoints of the ion

paths(11) determined in step d) and the ion-electron conversion
surface(3).
