<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronically commutated motor comprising a configuration (36, 80, 90) for detecting values of the motor current (I) which exceed a predetermined threshold value (it) and for generating a first signal when this threshold value is exceeded. The inventive motor also comprises a configuration (58 to 76) for detecting rotational speed values, said rotational speed values exceeding a predetermined rotational speed, and for generating a second signal when the predetermined rotational speed is exceeded. The motor also comprises a configuration (76, 72, 80) for linking the first and second signals in order to generate a link signal that, with essentially no time delay, influences a semiconductor control element (32, 40) which controls the motor current (I) and which, during the influence thereof, reduces said motor current to a value which is greater than zero.

<CLAIMS>
Electronically commutated motor with an arrangement (36, 80, 90) to capture values of the motor current (I) which exceed a specified threshold value (it), and to generate a first signal if this threshold value is exceeded, also with an arrangement (58 to 76) to capture rotational speed values which exceed a specified rotational speed, and to generate a second signal if the specified rotational speed is exceeded, and with an arrangement (76, 72, 80) to combine the first and second signals to generate a combination signal, which essentially acts without time delay on at least one semiconductor control element (32, 40) which controls the motor current (I), and while it is acting reduces this motor current to a value which is greater than zero.
Motor according to Claim 1, wherein the current to at least one winding phase (12, 14) of the motor is controllable via a transistor (32, 40), and the combination signal is used to reduce the base current of this transistor (32, 40) when it occurs.
Motor according to Claim 2, wherein a Miller capacitor (42, 44) is assigned to the transistor (32, 40), to reduce the speed of the current change in this transistor during commutation.
