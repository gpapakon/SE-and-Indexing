<ABSTRACT>
In order to effectively enhance the overall efficiency in casting 
operations, a process and system for cooling and cleaning a casting is disclosed. The 

process and system include removing the casting from a molding machine after it has 
been formed. The casting is then moved to a punch-out station for removing it from 

a sand mold. Next, the casting is moved to a shake-out station for shaking residual 
sand from it. The casting is then conveyed away from the shake-out station on a 

cooling conveyor. Next, the temperature of the casting is monitored at or near a 
downstream end of the cooling conveyor. The casting is then transferred from the 

cooling conveyor into a vibratory cooling drum where it is further cooled. In 
addition to these unique aspects, the process and system includes controlling the rate 

of cooling of the casting within the vibratory cooling drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to casting processes and
systems and, more particularly, a process and system for cooling and cleaning a
casting.Generally speaking, the processes and systems for the casting of metals
can oe divided into two principal categories. The first of these involves casting with
expendable molds, e.g., sand casting whereas the second category involves the utilization
of permanent molds which can be reused a large number of times. In either
case, it will be understood that it is necessary to initially make a model of the casting
to be produced.As is well recognized, the model is called a "pattern" in the field of
founding, and the mold is then produced from the pattern which may, by way of
example, be formed of wood, plaster, metal, plastics and the like. With the exception
of very simple castings, the pattern will generally include two or more parts, i.e., the
actual pattern as well as the core or cores which will form the cavities and recesses
in the casting.In casting with expendable molds, the molding materials used for
constructing the actual molds in which the metal will be cast are usually mineral
substances such as sand. The sand, along with bonding agents, give the molds the
necessary strength and dimensional accuracy. Moreover, with the bonding agents
which are commonly used, the bonding action may be achieved, depending upon the
materials, by either drying or chemical consolidation (curing).In dry sand molding, it is generally known that the mold is baked
whereas in green sand molding, the mold is typically utilized with sand in a damp,
or "green" condition. The metal is then poured either into an open mold or through
a system of channels in a closed mold. When the metal has solidified, the casting is
removed from the mold, it then undergoes additional cooling, and the casting is
finally cleaned by abrasive blasting, tumbling or the like. DE-A-3,100,028 describes a cooling tunnel for the controlled forced cooling of hot
unpacked castings.US-A-3,627,020 describes apparatus in which sand molds containing castings are
conveyed on a cooling conveyor to a mold-breaking station for breaking the molds and
releasing the castings. Further advancement of the conveyor pushes the fractured mold and
castings from the mold-breaking station onto a shakeout conveyor to complete the breakup of
the sand mold whereby the castings can be removed.US-E-33,542 describes vibratory tumbling apparatus for the shake out of
castings or the like. The apparatus comprises a horizontal
