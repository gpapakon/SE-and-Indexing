<ABSTRACT>
A tubular coupling is provided having first and second 
tubular elements (12,14). An annular cage (22) is fixedly 

mounted on the outer surface of a first section (12a) of the 
first tubular element (12) for defining a chamber (24) with 

the first section (12a) for housing a garter spring (20). 

The chamber (24) has an annular passage through which a 
flared end part (18) extending from a first portion (14a) of 

the second tubular element (14) passes during assembly of 
the first and second tubular elements (12,14) to permit the 

garter spring (20) to pass over the flared end part (18) and 
contract about the first portion (12a) for securing the 

tubular elements (12,14) in assembly. An expander ring (42) 
is provided for expanding and centering the garter 

spring (20) prior to assembly. Further provided are O-rings 
(28,30) retained on the outer surface of the first 

tubular element (12) for sealing the first tubular 
element (12) to the second tubular element (14). The O-rings 

(28,30) engage with the second tubular element (14) 
just before the first and second tubular elements (12,14) 

are secured in assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluid line couplings
and, more particularly, to quick-connect tubular couplings.In U.S. Patent No. 4,055,359, a quick-connect tubular
coupling is disclosed comprising a pair of tubular elements
which, when properly assembled with one another, form a
fluid-tight coupling. The first tubular element is provided
with an externally mounted cage which houses a garter
spring. The end of the second tubular element is flared and
sized to be received in the cage. The two tubular elements
are assembled by pushing the second tubular element over the
first tubular element so that the flared end of the second
tubular element enters the cage and forces the garter spring
to expand and pass over same. After passing over the flared
end, the garter spring is interposed between the cage and
the flared end for securing the first and second tubular
elements in assembly.Fluid is prevented from passing from the coupling by a
pair of O-rings retained on the first tubular element. The
O-rings are positioned at spaced-apart locations along the
outer surface of the first tubular element and engage with
the inner surface of the second tubular element during
assembly. The O-rings are sized so that they are compressed
between the two tubular elements after assembly to produce
the requisite seal.Because of their size, the O-rings create frictional
resistance to the assembly of the two tubular elements with
the resistance increasing when both O-rings are compressed.
The resulting frictional resistance has sometimes resulted
in an operator mistakenly believing that the coupling has
been properly connected when, in fact, it has not. If
proper connection is not made, the first and second tubular
elements will eventually separate during normal operation
resulting in loss of fluid from the system. Assembly of the first and second tubular elements is
further hindered by the substantial force required to expand
the garter spring so that it can pass over the flared end of
the second tubular element. If the coupling is located in a
difficult to reach location of an engine compartment, the
substantial force required to expand the garter spring can
be especially problematic.A further problem occurs when the garter spring becomes
trapped between the cage and the flared end of the second
tubular element. When this occurs, the garter spring is
prevented from passing over the flared end of the second
tubular element. This may result when the garter spring is
not properly centered about the first tubular element prior
