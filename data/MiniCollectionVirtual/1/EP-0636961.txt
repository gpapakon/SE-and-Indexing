<ABSTRACT>
A setback control for an HVAC system (12) is 
selectable by depressing a switch (26) on a control 

panel (28) associated with a programmed microprocessor 
(10). The programmed microprocessor is operative to 

thereafter change the setpoint temperature by a 
predefined amount each hour until a predetermined number 

of hours have passed. The set point temperature is 
thereafter held for a further hourly count before being 

returned to the starting setpoint temperature. The 
directional change in setpoint temperature is a function 

of whether the HVAC system is in a heating or cooling 
mode of operation selected by switch (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of temperatures
during a setback period normally occurring at night. In
particular, this invention relates to the automatic
control of the setpoint temperature for a heating,
ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system during
such a period.Thermostatic control of nighttime temperatures during
normal sleeping hours is well known in the art. This is
quite often accomplished by a programmable thermostat
which allows a person to define one or more setback
temperatures that are to be maintained for predetermined
periods of time. The thermostatic control is thereafter
operative to implement the setback during the
predetermined periods before returning to the previous
temperature or to a new temperature in the morning.
GB-A-1589563 discloses a temperature control system
arranged to control heating or cooling equipment so as
to control the temperature of an associated medium
between given limits in accordance with predetermined
programmes or "ramps".The above thermostatic control requires that
programmable entries be made by a person. Each
programmable entry by the person may require several
steps to select and store a temperature that is to occur
at a given time. The particular selection of
temperatures may not have been done with regard to the
need to avoid a sharp drop or rise in temperature which
may produce an uncomfortable sleeping environment. The
above personally programmed control may also not take
into account changes in the season wherein the
temperature may need to be relaxed differently when
heating versus cooling is being required of the HVAC
unit. According to the invention there is provided a system
for controlling the temperature of an interior space,
said system including a setpoint temperature control
comprising:
a clock timing means for defining a predetermined
period of time;means for triggering said clock timing means to
begin the clocking of the predetermined period;means for counting the number of times the
predetermined period of time has elapsed;means for changing the current setpoint temperature
by a predefined amount each time a change occurs in the
count of the number of times the predetermined period of
time has elapsed; andmeans for suspending said means for changing the
current setpoint temperature by a predetermined amount
when the count of the number of times the predetermined
period of time has elapsed reaches a predetermined
number.The invention provides an automatic setback control for
a heating, ventilating and air conditioning
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system for controlling the temperature of an
interior space, said system including a setpoint

temperature control comprising:

a clock timing means (10,68) for defining a
predetermined period of time;
means (26,64) for triggering said clock timing
means to begin the clocking of the predetermined period;
means (10,76) for counting the number of times the
predetermined period of time has elapsed;
means (10,86,88) for changing the current setpoint
temperature by a predefined amount each time a change

occurs in the count of the number of times the
predetermined period of time has elapsed; and
means (10,82) for suspending said means for
changing the current setpoint temperature by a

predetermined amount when the count of the number of
times the predetermined period of time has elapsed

reaches a predetermined number.
The system of claim 1 further comprising:

means (10,78) for restoring the setpoint
temperature to the starting setpoint temperature when

the count of the number of times the predetermined
period of time has elapsed reaches a second

predetermined number.
The system of claim 1 or 2 wherein said means for
changing the current setpoint temperature by a 

predefined amount comprises:

means (30) for selecting a heating or cooling mode
of operation;
means (10,84,86), responsive to a heating mode
selection, for decreasing the current setpoint

temperature by the predefined amount; and
means (10,84,88), responsive to a cooling mode
selection, for increasing the current setpoint

temperature by the predefined amount.
The system of claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said means
for triggering said clock timing means comprises:


a switch (26) operable by a person to initiate a
predefined control of the setpoint temperature.
The system of any preceding claim further
comprising:


a switch (26) for selecting when a predefined
control of the setpoint temperature is to be initiated

or terminated; and
means (10,70), responsive to said switch, for
restoring the setpoint temperature to the setpoint

temperature occurring at the time the predefined control
was first initiated when the switch selection indicates

a termination of the predefined control.
The system of claim 4 or 5 comprising:

programmable processing means (10) connected to
said switch (26) for implementing the predefined control

of the setpoint temperature when the switch selection is 
made, said processing means furthermore being connected

to a nonvolatile memory (34).
The system of claim 6 further comprising:

means for controlling a heating, ventilating and
air conditioning system (12) in response to the change

in setpoint temperature, whereby the control of the
setpoint temperature and the control of the heating

ventilating and air conditioning system are both under
the control of said processing means.
A process for controlling the setpoint temperature

of:

defining a predetermined period of time;
initiating (64) a clocking of the predetermined
period;
