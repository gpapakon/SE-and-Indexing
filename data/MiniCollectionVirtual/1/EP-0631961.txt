<ABSTRACT>
Thread-guiding components in devices for the production, treatment and processing of fibre materials, having a surface coming into contact with the fibre materials, are described, the surface of the components which comes into contact with the fibre material being defined by specific values of the maximum averaged roughness depth Rz and by the values of the supporting fraction which are calculated for specific depths of cut. The defined surface consists of a metal/ceramic material. Preferably, a 0.1 to 10.0  mu m thick outer layer of nitrides and/or carbides of titanium or chromium is also precipitated on this. The components are characterised by a substantially increased long-term stability of the surface properties. The components are preferably galettes.

<CLAIMS>
A thread-guiding component of apparatus for producing, 
treating and processing fiber materials 

which has at least in the areas which come into 
contact with the fiber material a surface composed 

of a material having a specific electric resistance 
of not more than 25, preferably from 20 to about 

1.5 µΩ·cm, which surface is characterized in that 


a) the 5 measurement average value 
R
max
 of its 
maximum roughness depth R
max
 is between 20 and 
30 µm, with a root mean square deviation from 

3 to 8 µm, and 
b) the 5 measurement average value 
R
Z
 of its averaged 
roughness depth R
z
 is between 15 and 
25 µm, with a root mean square deviation from 

2 to 5 µm. 
The thread-guiding component of claim 1, 
characterized in that the surface is such that 


c) the loadbearing proportion works out at 10% for 
a plane at a depth of cut from 6 to 12 µm and 

at 90% for a plane at a depth of cut from 18 to 
25 µm, and 
d) the slope of the depth of cut/loadbearing 
proportion function is from 0.11 to 0.16 µm/% 

within the loadbearing proportion range from 30 
to 70%. 
The thread-guiding component of at least one of 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that it consists in 

its entirety of the cermet material having a 
specific electric resistance of not more than 25, 

preferably from 20 to about 1.5 µΩ·cm or has a thick 
layer of such a material at least in the areas which 

come into contact with the fiber material. 
The thread-guiding component of at least one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it has an outer 

layer of titanium nitride (TiN) and/or titanium 
carbonitride (Ti(C,N)) and/or chromium nitride 

(CrN). 
The thread-guiding component of at least one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the cermet 

material having a specific electric resistance of 
not more than 25, preferably from 20 to about 

1.5 µΩ·cm consists of tungsten carbide (WC) having 
a carbon content of at least 6.15% by weight with an 

addition of from 10 to 20% by weight of a metal of 
group 8 of the periodic table, preferably of cobalt. 
The thread-guiding component of at least one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it is a godet.
