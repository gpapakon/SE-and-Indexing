<ABSTRACT>
A method is specified for producing a blade ring for rotors, constructed in the form of drums, of turbo engines, in particular rotors for axial flow compressors (axial turbo machines) of gas turbine power plants. The aim in this case is to produce the blade ring by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and in the process to produce rings which are bound into metallic powder material for the blade ring and spaced apart in the circumferential direction and are reinforced by fibres embedded in a metal matrix in which the blade ring thus prefabricated (preformed, preengineered) is to be re-worked (remachined) to the desired size (design size, specified dimensions) after the HIP.

A process for manufacturing a blade ring (2; 2'; 2") for drum-like constructed
rotors of turbines, in particular rotors for axial compressors of gas turbine

engines, encompassing the following steps:

a) several fibre rings (10; 10'; 10") made of fibres bound in a metal matrix, are
embedded in a metal powder;
b) a hot isostatic pressing (HIP) of the arrangement according to a), wherein the
metal material of the fibre rings (10; 10'; 10") is welded with the metal powder by

surface diffusion;
c) A finishing of the thus pre-fabricated blade ring-blanks to a specified size.
A process according to claim 1, wherein:

the fibre rings (10; 10'; 10") are arranged in a ring capsule (11; 11'; 11")
the ring capsule (11; 11'; 11") is filled with the metal powder,
powder filling openings of the ring capsule (11; 11'; 11") are hermetically
sealed,
the HIP process is carried out through the ring capsule (11; 11'; 11"), wherein
the fibre rings (10; 10'; 10") are securely bound into the metal material of the

blade ring, and 
after removal of the ring capsule (11; 11'; 11"), a finish-machining of the blade
ring-blank is carried out.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the ring capsule (11') is pre-formed
in the shape, to be coarsely prefabricated during HIP, of axial grooves (9) or of a

circumferential groove, which in the course of a reworking of the blade ring blank
carried out after the HIP, are finished to the actual required shapes and

dimensions of the blade bases.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the ring capsule (11') is pre-formed
in the shape, to be prefabricated during HIP, of a common outer ring surface, or

of several axial base stumps (12) to be distributed equally over the
circumference, of the blade ring (2'), wherein the outer ring surface or the base

stumps (12) are finished after HIP and after that, rotor blades (8) are connected
to the rin
g surfaces or the stumps by linear friction welding.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the ring capsule (11") is pre-formed
so as to be enlarged, in the shape of a profile section joined to the blade ring (2")

together on one side over the circumference, which profile section, after HIP, is
reworked in one or several stages into individual, equally shaped rotor blades (8)

distributed over the circumference.
A process according to one or several of the claims 2 to 5, wherein resilient,
powder-permeable means are arranged in the ring capsule (11), in such a way

that the fibre rings (10) are resiliently supported mutually and in relation to the
ring capsule (11).
A process according to one or several of the claims 1 to 6, wherein the fibres of
the fibre rings (10; 10'; 10") embedded in a metal matrix are arranged in a

direction extending over the blade ring circumference. 
A process according to one or several of the claims 1 to 7, wherein for the
surface diffusion during the HIP process, the same or the same type of metal

materials are used for the matrix of the fibre rings and for the powder material of
the blade rings.
A process according to one or several of the claims 1 to 8, wherein for the
manufacture of the blade ring (2; 2'; 2"), fibre rings (10; 10'; 10") are used whose

fibres are firstly coated with metal and wherein then the individual metal coatings
of the fibres are diffusion-welded by an HIP process to form a common fibre-matrix.
A process according to one or several of the claims 1 to 9, wherein the fibre
rings (10") used for the manufacture of the blade rings (2; 2'; 2") are made from

a core (13) with fibres (14) which extend in the circumferential direction of the
blade ring and which are securely embedded in a metal matrix, and wherein this

core is provided completely with an adhesive, metal surface coating (15), which
is diffusion-welded with the powder material of the blade ring during the HIP

process responsible for the blade ring manufacture.
A process according to one or several of claims 1 to 10, wherein the fibre rings
with their respective ring centres, are bonded in the blade ring so as to be secure

against rotation in a ring plane concentric to the rotation axis of the greatest
circumferential and radial loading.
A process according to one or several of the claims 1 to 11, wherein a titanium-based
alloy, in particular including intermetallic phases, is used for the powder

material of the blade ring and/or for the metal matrix of the fibre rings.
A process for manufacturing a rotor drum, wherein several blade rings (2, 2', 2")
which have been manufactured according to a process according to one or

several of the claims 1 to 12, are welded together directly or by using
intermediate rings or sealing rings (3, 4) to form a rotor drum.
