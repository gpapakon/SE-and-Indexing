<ABSTRACT>
A combined catalytic cracking and olefin production process uses a coked 
catalytic cracking catalyst as a dehydrogenation catalyst to dehydrogenate an alkane 

feed and form an olefin rich product. The method uses a plug flow regeneration system 
to form the dehydrogenation catalyst and to fully reactivate cracking catalyst for reuse 

in the cracking reaction. The catalyst preferably comprises a crystalline tetrahedral 
framework oxide component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combined catalytic cracking and olefin
producing process.The emergence of low emissions fuels has created a need to increase the
availability of olefins for use in alkylation, oligomerization, MTBE and ETBE synthesis.
In addition, a low cost supply of olefins continues to be in demand to serve as feedstock
for polyolefin production.Fixed bed processes for light paraffin dehydrogenation have recently
attracted renewed interest for increasing olefin production. However, these type of
processes typically require a high capital investment as well as a high operating cost. It
is, therefore, advantageous to increase olefin yield using processes which require only a
minimal amount of capital investment. It would be particularly advantageous to
increase olefin yield in catalytic cracking processes.US-A-4,830,728 discloses a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
unit which is operated to maximize olefin production. The FCC unit has two separate
risers in which different feed streams are introduced. The operation of the risers is
designed so that a certain catalyst will act to convert a heavy gas oil in one riser and a
different catalyst will act to crack a lighter olefin/naphtha feed in the other riser.
Conditions within the heavy gas oil riser are modified to maximize either gasoline or
olefin production. The primary means of maximizing production of the desired product
is by using a specified catalyst.A problem inherent in producing olefin products using FCC units is that
the process depends upon a specific catalyst balance to maximize production. In addition, even 
if a specific catalyst balance can be maintained to maximize overall olefin production, olefin
selectivity is generally low due to undesirable side reactions such as extensive cracking,
isomerization, aromatization and hydrogen transfer reactions. It is, therefore, desirable that
olefin production be maximized in a process which allows a high degree of control over
olefin selectivity.EP-A-0325437 describes and claims a process for regenerating a coke-contaminated
fluid cracking catalyst in a regeneration zone at a pressure in the range from above 240 kPa
to 446 kPa and a temperature in the range from 650°C to 815°C while injecting the
regeneration zone with enough oxygen-containing regeneration gas to maintain a dense fluid
bed of regeneration catalyst, and regenerate the catalyst before returning it to a fluid cracker,
comprising,
a) withdrawing a controlled stream of the regenerator catalyst and introducing
it into a
