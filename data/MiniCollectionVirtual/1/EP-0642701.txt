<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to disposable tool useful for
maintaining receptacles or power pins within a header
therefor during transport of the same.Description of the Prior Art In usual practice a power header having one or
more receptacles or one or more power pins therein is transported from manufacturer to
customer with the receptacles or pins, as the case may be, loosely received within the
header. As a consequence the customer is left with the labor intensive task of properly
locating the receptacles or the pins prior to attachment of the same on the substrate
which the header is to populate.US-A- 4,887,981 (Damon et al) discloses a carrier system for receptacles. US-A-3,601,770
(Bowley) discloses a detachable endpiece for an edge connector that
overhangs the connector housing. US-A- 4,693,528 (Asick et al) discloses a connector
with anchor clips. CHA-A-658,549 describes an electrical plug connector and tools for it. EP-A- 0 237,728 describes a tool and method for assembling a
printed circuit card.
The tool comprises a base plate having wedge-shaped
protrusions. The protrusions fit into contacts on connector
springs to hold the connector springs firmly in an
aligned position in a housing, while a tail or arm that
extends from each connector spring is soldered to a tab
or pad on the edge of the printed circuit card. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a disposable locating
tool for use with a receptacle header housing of the type having adjacent first and
second power receptacle receiving ports having axes therethrough, each power
receptacle receiving port having a power pin receiving receptacle disposed therein with
each receptacle having a barrel with an axis therethrough, the axis of each barrel being
able to lie in misalignment with respect to the axis of the port in which it is disposed
and with respect to the axis of the adjacent barrel, the tool comprising:
a web,a first and second base connected to the web,a positioning contour disposed on each base anda plug having an axis therethrough extending from each positioning contour, the
axes of the plugs being spaced a predetermined distance apart so that the plugs are
receivable in the adjacent ports and the positioning contours associated with the plugs
then engage against portions of the header housing surrounding the power ports with
each plug extending into the barrel of one of the receptacles to bring the axis of each
barrel into coaxial alignment with the axis of the port in which the

A disposable locating tool (6) for use with a receptacle header housing (12) of the
type having adjacent first and second power receptacle receiving ports (24) having axes

(24A) therethrough, each power receptacle receiving port having a power pin receiving
receptacle (34) disposed therein with each receptacle having a barrel (42) with an axis

(42A) therethrough, the axis of each barrel being able to lie in misalignment with
respect to the axis of the port in which it is disposed and with respect to the axis of the

adjacent barrel, the tool comprising:

a web,
a first and second base (62) connected to the web,
a positioning contour (64) disposed on each base (62) and
a plug (66) having an axis therethrough extending from each positioning contour
(64), the axes of the plugs being spaced a predetermined distance apart so that the plugs

are receivable in the adjacent ports (24) and the positioning contours (64) associated
with the plugs (66) then engage against portions of the header housing (12) surrounding

the power ports (24) with each plug extending into the barrel (42) of one of the
receptacles (34) to bring the axis (42A) of each barrel (42) into coaxial alignment with

the axis (24A) of the port (24) in which the receptacle (34) is disposed and
simultaneously to space the axis (42A) of the barrel (42) of the one receptacle (34) the

predetermined distance from the axis (42A) of the barrel (42) of the adjacent receptacle.
A disposable receptacle locating tool of claim 1, wherein the housing has at least
four lead-in surfaces (26A-D) leading into each port (24) and wherein each positioning

contour (64) engages against at least two lead-in surfaces about one of the ports thereby
to align the axis of each barrel (42) with the axis (24A) of the port (24) in which it is

disposed.
A disposable receptacle locating tool of claim 2, wherein each port (24) is square,
and wherein the positioning contour (64) on each base (62) engages against all four

lead-in surfaces (26A-D) about one of the ports (24).
A disposable receptacle locating tool of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein each
positioning contour has a larger width than the associated plug.
A disposable receptacle locating tool of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein each
plug has a head remote from the associated positioning contour.
A disposable receptacle locating tool of claim 5, wherein each positioning contour
is curved, each plug is cylindrical and each head has a circular profile.
A disposable receptacle locating tool of any one of claims 5 or 6, wherein each
head is frusto conically tapered. 
A disposable pin locating tool (74) for use with a pin header (10) of the type
having adjacent first and second power pin receiving ports (24) each defined by at least

four surfaces (28A-28D), each power pin receiving port having an axis therethrough,
and having a power pin (36) disposed therein, each power pin (36) having an axis

therethrough, the axis of each power pin being able to lie in misalignment with respect
to the axis of the port in which it is disposed and with respect to the axis of the adjacent

power pin, the tool comprising:

a web and
first and second adjacent sleeves connected to the web, each sleeve being
composed of a non-conducting material and having a central bore (78) extending

therethrough and an outer positioning surface (80) thereon, each sleeve having an axis
therethrough, the axes of the sleeves being spaced a predetermined distance apart,
such that when in use the positioning surface of each sleeve engages against at
least two opposed surfaces of one of the ports and the bore of each sleeve locates around

one of the pins to bring the axis of each pin into coaxial alignment with the axis of the
port in which the pin is disposed and simultaneously to space the axis of the first pin the

predetermined distance from the axis of the second pin.
A disposable pin locating tool of claim 8, wherein the each port is rectangular.
A disposable pin locating tool of claim 8, wherein each port (24) is square and
wherein the positioning surface of each sleeve serves to engage against all four defining

surfaces (28A-28D). 
A disposable pin locating tool of any one of claims 8 to 10, further comprising a
clip (88) integrally formed with each sleeve (76), the clip being attachable to the header

thereby to hold the associated sleeve (76) having the associated power pin (36) therein
within the associated port (24).
In combination the tool according to any one of claims 1 to 11 with the associated
header.
