<ABSTRACT>
A time based multimedia object is typically presented on a data processing 
system user interface as a time bar. With the present invention, selected content 

types of the object are depicted on the user interface in conjunction with 
the time bar. The content depiction is located along the time bar at a location 

that corresponds to the temporal location of the depicted content in the presentation 
of the object. A user is able to identify and select a specific content 

type of an object from the depiction of the specific content. The time bar can 
be modified to add a depiction, wherein a search is conducted for the specified 

content in the object.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to user interfaces for data processing systems, 
and in particular to representations of objects using graphical time bars. Data processing systems allow the presentation of multimedia objects to a 
user. Multimedia objects can contain data for audio, images or graphics and 
video. The construction, editing and presentation of multimedia objects are simplified 
through the use of graphical user interfaces. A standard graphical user 
interface representation of a time based object is a rectangular time bar. The 
time bar, which is typically horizontal, contains a block or an interface that 
moves along the length of the time bar. The movement of the block or the interface represents the progress of the 
presentation of the multimedia object. For example, if the multimedia object 
is one minute in duration, then the scale of the time bar, from the beginning 
end to the finishing end, is one minute. As the object is presented to the user, 
either through speakers, a display or both, the block moves from the beginning 
end towards the finishing end. The moving block represents the progress of the 
presentation. Time bars are useful for editing an object and for playing or presenting 
portions of an object. A user can use the time bar to select a segment of the 
object for editing. For example, a user can select a segment of the time bar 
starting at 20 seconds (from the beginning of the presentation) and ending at 
30 seconds, in order to edit a 10 second long segment of the object data. The 
user can also select a segment of the time bar to play the corresponding segment 
of the object data. The problem with this prior art time bar technique is that the user is unable 
to determine the content of the segments of the objects merely by looking 
at the time bar. If the user wished to edit, for example, a pastoral scene from 
a video object, then the user must search the object by playing selected segments  
 
on a trial and error basis. For example, the user could select a 10 to 20 
second segment of the object and play that segment, while looking for the 
pastoral scene. Only by viewing the presentation of the object itself is a user 
able to determine the location of the pastoral scene in the sequence of the object 
data. This searching process can be a time consuming procedure in both 
the editing and presentation processes. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for 
depicting the content of an object by way of a graphical time bar. The

<CLAIMS>
A method for depicting content of an object on a data processing system, 
said object having data that is presented over a period of time, comprising the 

steps of: 

a) providing a temporal location of a predetermined type of content of 
said object in said object; and 
b) producing a graphical representation of said object on a user interface 
of said data processing system, said representation having a first portion and 

a second portion, said first portion representing said period of time of said 
presentation of said object data, said second portion representing said predetermined 

content, said second portion being positioned relative to said first 
portion in a manner that corresponds to said location of said predetermined 

content in said object. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said step of providing a location of said 
predetermined type of content of said object in said object further comprises 

the step of searching said object for the location of said predetermined content. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said step of producing a graphical representation 
of said object on a user interface further comprises the step of representing 

said first portion as a time bar. 
The method of claim 3 wherein said step of producing a graphical representation 
of said object on a user interface further comprises the step of representing 

said second portion by a color, shape or size that is different than 
a color, shape or size of said time bar. 
The method of claim 3 wherein said step of producing a graphical representation 
of said object on a user interface further comprises the step of representing 

said second portion by one or more markers along said time bar. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of providing to a user a 
listing of content types in said object and awaiting a selection of one of said 

content types by said user, said content selection representing said predetermined 
content. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of providing to a user a 
listing of types of said second portions and awaiting a selection of one of said 

second portion types by said user, said second portion selection representing 
said produced second portion. 
The method of claim I further comprising the step of allowing a user to 
select said second portion, wherein the selection of said second portion provides 

the presentation of said predetermined content. 
A data processing system for depicting content of an object, said object being 
located on said system and said object having data that is presented over 

a period of time, comprising: 

a) means for providing a temporal location of a predetermined type of 
content of said object in said object; and 
b) means for producing a graphical representation of said object on a user 
interface of said data processing system, said representation having a first 

portion and a second portion, said first portion representing said period of time 
of said presentation of said object data, said second portion representing said 

predetermined content, said second portion being positioned relative to said 
first portion in a manner that corresponds to said location of said predetermined 

content in said object. 
The data processing system of claim 9 wherein said means for providing 
a location of said predetermined type of content of said object in said object 

 
further comprises means for searching said object for the location of said predetermined 

content. 
The data processing system of claim 9 wherein said means for producing 
a graphical representation of said object on a user interface further comprises 

means for representing said first portion as a time bar. 
The data processing system of claim 11 wherein said means for producing 
a graphical representation of said object on a user interface further comprises 

means for representing said second portion by a color, shape or size that is 
different than a color, shape or size of said time bar. 
The data processing system of claim 11 wherein said means for producing 
a graphical representation of said object on a user interface further comprises 

means for representing said second portion by one or more markers along said 
time bar. 
The data processing system of claim 9 further comprising means for providing 
to a user a listing of content types in said object and awaiting a selection 

of one of said content types by said user, said content selection representing 
said predetermined content. 
The data processing system of claim 9 further comprising means for providing 
to a user a listing of types of said second portions and for awaiting a 

selection of one of said second portion types by said user, said second portion 
selection representing said produced second portion. 
The data processing system of claim 9 further comprising means for allowing 
a user to select said second portion, wherein the selection of said second
