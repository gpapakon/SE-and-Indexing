<ABSTRACT>
Doubled yarn is produced from fibre by integrated spinning and doubling. Two side by side spinning units (R1,R2) are placed within the yarn balloons of a two-for-one twister and supply singles yarn (F1,F2) to a hollow central spindle (11,29). The yarns then go through a radially outward channel (27) to a guide element (7) and the doubled yarn (F3) is drawn off at a central guide (37) and taken to a windup. The fibre opening sections (14,15) of the spinning units are outside the yarn balloons and the fibre supply ducts (3,4) line up with the feed ducts (5,6) of the spinning units.

Method of manufacturing a twisted thread in an integrated 
spinning/twisting process, in the case of which, by means 

of at least two spinning units (R1, R2) located side 
by side, individual spinning threads (F1, F2) are produced 

from fibre material, these being guided together and, 
in a first running direction of the thread, being jointly 

subjected to a twist torsion, characterized in that the 
spinning threads (F1, F2) are then guided in a second 

running direction of the thread, which runs counter to 
the first running direction of the thread, and thus form 

a balloon of thread rotating around the spinning units 
which they run through and in which - in accordance with 

the two-for-one principle - they are subjected to the 
second twist torsion in order finally to be drawn off 

through a centring point (37) lying in the extension of 
the axis of the balloon of thread; and in that unravelled 

fibre material is supplied to each spinning unit (R1, R2) 
through the enveloping surface defined by the balloon of 

thread. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
fibre material is supplied substantially from the side or 

radially to the spinning units (R1, R2). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the supply of fibre material takes place as the 

result of a negative pressure gradient in direction of 
the fibre supply. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
supply of fibre material takes place by means of negative 

pressure. 
Apparatus for implementing the method according to Claim 
1, having at least one spindle rotor, which is pivot-mounted 

in a machine-frame (21) and can be driven, and 
one hollow spindle shaft (11, 29) to which a thread-guiding  

 
channel (27) is connected which runs substantially 

radially outwards for a thread which, after emerging from 
the thread-guiding channel (27), is guided on in the form 

of a balloon to a centring point (37) lying in the 
extension of the hollow spindle shaft (11, 29) and then to 

a thread winding-up unit (8), and having a device for 
supplying unravelled fibre material into the space defined 

by the balloon of thread, characterized in that, within 
the space defined by the balloon of thread, at least two 

spinning units (R1, R2) are located, each with associated 
fibre material supply-pipes (5, 6), whose outer fibre 

material supply openings, outside the space defined by 
the balloon of thread, lie opposite fibre material 

supply-pipes (3, 4) as parts of fibre material unravelling 
units (14, 15); in that thread-delivery pipes (31, 32) are 

associated with the spinning units in such a way that the 
spinning threads (F1, F2) produced by means of the 

spinning units can be guided together centrally into the 
hollow spindle shaft (11, 29); and in that a thread-guiding 

element (7), following on from the outlet of the 
thread-guiding channel (27), is firmly fixed to the 

spindle rotor. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in that, as 
part of the thread-guiding element (7) rotating with the 

spindle rotor, a thread-guiding component (8) is provided 
which projects into the gap between the outer fibre 

material supply openings of the fibre material supply-pipes 
(5, 6) and the mouths of the fibre material supply-pipes 

(3, 4) lying opposite. 
Apparatus according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that 
the spindle rotor includes a hollow shaft (23) which can 

be connected at its outer end to an air pipe and on to 
which a substantially closed chamber (12), secured against 

rotation, is mounted which accommodates the spinning units  
 

(R1, R2) and their drive mechanism (M) and includes at the 
inner end of the hollow shaft (23) follow-on air channels 

(39, 40) which are located so that they are capable of 
building up in the fibre material supply-pipes (5, 6) of 

the spinning units (R1, R2) which are guided through wall 
sections of the chamber (12) a pressure gradient which is 

negative in direction of the fibre supply and causes 
fibre to be supplied to the spinning units. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in that the 
chamber (12) has a removable cover (12.3). 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized by a 
stationary, substantially closed external housing (34, 

35) which surrounds the chamber (12) and on whose upper 
side, coaxially with the hollow spindle shaft, the 

centring point is located in the form of a thread outlet 
(37) and in whose side-wall the mouths of the fibre 

material supply-pipes (3, 4) are located. 
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterized in that the 
housing (34) has a removable cover (35).
