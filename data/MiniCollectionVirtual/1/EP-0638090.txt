 I 7α AND I7|J-SUBSTITUTED ESTRA-l,3,5( IO)-TRIENE-3-CARBOXYLIC ACIDFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to certain novel 17α and 17β substituted acyl 3-carboxy aromatic A ring steroidal compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds, and methods for using these compounds to inhibit steroid 5-α-reductase. Also invented are novel intermediates and processes useful in preparing these compounds.DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART The class of steroidal hormones known as androgens is responsible for the physical characteristics that differentiate males from females. Of the several organs that produce androgens, the testes produce these hormones in the greatest amounts. Centers in the brain exert primary control over the level of androgen production. Numerous physical manifestations and disease states result when ineffective control results in excessive androgen hormone production. For example, acne vulgaris, seborrhea, female hirsutism, male pattern baldness and prostate diseases such as benign prostatic hypertropy are correlated with elevated androgen levels. Additionally, the reduction of androgen levels has been shown to have a therapeutic effect on prostate cancer.Testosterone is the principal androgen secreted by the testes and is the primary androgenic steroid in the plasma of males. It now is known that 5-α-reduced androgens are the active hormones in some tissues such as the prostate and sebaceous gland. Circulating testosterone thus serves as a prohormone for dihydrotestosterone (DHT), its 5-α-reduced analogue, in these tissues but not in others such as muscle and testes. Steroid 5-α-reductase is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) dependent enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT. The importance of this enzyme in male development was dramatically underscored by the discovery of a genetic steroid 5-α-reductase deficiency in male pseudohermaphrodites. Imperato-McGinley, J., el -, (1979), J. Steroid Biochem. 11:637-648.Recognition of the importance of elevated DHT levels in various disease states has stimulated many efforts to synthesize inhibitors of 

this enzyme. Among the most potent inhibitors identified to date are 3- carboxy-estra-l,3,5(10) triene steroidal derivatives.A number of 5-α-reductase inhibiting compounds are known in the art. For example,1. J. Steroid Biochem.. Vol. 34, Nos. 1-6 pp. 571-575(1989), by M.A. Levy, et al., describes the interaction mechanism between rat prostatic steroid 5-alpha reductase and 3-carboxy-17β-substituted
