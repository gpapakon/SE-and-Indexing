<ABSTRACT>
A system and method which enables the location and orientation of an
image to be determined without introducing scanning artifacts into the rendered

image. The system utilizes a separate set of sensors on a scanning bar that are
sensitive to a wavelength of light outside the range of wavelengths of the typical

sensors found on the scanning bar, such as red, green, or blue. Moreover, the
system includes a light source which is capable of emitting the wavelength of light

that is outside this range of wavelength of light. Thus, whenever the additional
set of sensors detect light, the system would determine that the light was due to a

scanning artifact, such as a hole, rip, or dog ear in the original document being
scanned. Furthermore, the system would include a process which me
asures the
variations of the image signal in the fastscan and slowscan directions, as well as,

the gray level of the video signal from these various measurements, the system
would develop a cost value as to the certainty as whether the signal represents a

scanning artifact. In such a system, the backing would be embedded with a
pattern which would have a predetermined variation in a fastscan direction but

have little or no variation in a slowscan direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a system which generally scans
original documents and converts these documents into electronic image data
which can be utilized by a printing system to render the electronic image on a
subsequent recording medium. More particularly, the present invention is
directed to a system and method for detecting scanning artifacts which are
produced during the conversion of the image on a scanned document into
electronic image data.In the reproduction of copies of an original document from video image
data created, for example, by electronic input scanning from an original document,
it is often desirable to provide functions dependent upon determining the exterior
edges of the document. Such features include, for example, automatic
magnification, automatic two-up copying, deletion of background image data
which falls outside the detected exterior edges of the document, to avoid storing a
document requiring more space than necessary, automatic location of the
document in a scanning system, electronic deskewing of the electronic image, etc.
In other words, to provide these features, the exterior edges of the document must
somehow be detected by the scanning system.Conventionally, to achieve this detection of the exterior edges of the
original document, a background has been provided, for the original document, in
the scanning system wherein the background provides a backdrop for the original
document, such that the background has a tendency to be distinguishable from
the original document. For example, backgrounds have been provided with a 
yellow color, a black color or a white color with a whiter than white color, a
backing which fluoresces, and various other alternatives.Although various alternatives have been utilized, it is most desirable to
utilize a dark backing when scanning an original document so as to eliminate
show through when scanning a double-sided or watermarked document. Thus,
utilizing a light absorbing backing such as a black color, the scanning system can
both eliminate show through when scanning the document and enable the
scanning system or other downstream image processing system to automatically
locate the exterior edges of the original document so that the various features
discussed above can be readily implemented.However, an undesirable consequence of using a light absorbing backing
is that any defects in the original document; such as holes, rips, dog-ears, etc. or
other characteristic properties of the original; such as pre-punched holes, etc.;
appear
