<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to insulating articles (i.e.
electrical insulators) with high surface electrical resistivity
and high flame resistance, essentially composed of a
composition comprising one or more thermoplastic polymers, or
polymers with elastomeric properties, preferably olefin
polymers, and one or more additives selected from phosphoric
acid salts of particular amine compounds.It is known in the art that to reduce or eliminate the
combustibility of said polymers one can add various types of
fire resistant formulations.For example, it is possible to add metal compounds,
especially antimony, bismuth or arsenic compounds, in
combination with halogenated organic compounds such as
chlorinated paraffins and polybromodiphenyl ethers, which
decompose at combustion temperature. Said formulations allow
one to obtain satisfactory levels of flame resistance.Considerably better results, in terms or flame resistance
and reduction of toxic and/or corrosive fumes and gases during
combustion, are obtained using the so-called intumescent
formulations, which generally comprise organic nitrogen
compounds (such as piperazine, triazine or melamine
derivatives, for example) and ammonium polyphosphate. Examples
of intumescent formulations of this type are described in
European Patent No. 115,871.However, as clearly demonstrated in the comparative 
examples of published European patent application 391 336, the
surface electrical resistivity of polymer compositions
containing intumescent formulations based on organic nitrogen
compounds and ammonium polyphosphate undergoes considerable
reduction when exposed to heat and humidity. To avoid said
drawback, the above mentioned patent application suggests that
in addition to said intumescent formulations, various additives
selected from silane compounds, olefin rubbers, polyethylene,
cross-linking agents and thiophosphites be incorporated with
the polymers. The examples of said European patent application
show that the above mentioned additives lessen the reduction
of the surface electrical resistivity of the polymers after the
latter undergo exposure to heat and humidity for 7 days. In
this manner polymer compositions particularly suitable for the
production of insulating articles are obtained, thanks to their
high and stable surface electrical resistivity and their high
flame resistance.However, as it will be demonstrated in the comparative
examples that follow, even the above formulations do not allow
to maintain high levels of surface electrical resistivity when
