<ABSTRACT>
Hollow spheroidal agglomerated pentasil zeolites having a particle size of from 5 to 200 microns, a process for producing these hollow spheroidal agglomerated pentasil zeolites by treating a mixture of an aqueous alkylenediamine, alkylenetriamine and/or alkylenetetramine, silicon dioxide and an aluminium, boron and/or titanium salt at temperatures of from 20 to 100 DEG C, subsequently crystallising it at temperatures of from 110 to 200 DEG C and pressures of from 0.01 to 50 bar and calcining it at temperatures of from 400 to 650 DEG C, and also their use as catalysts and/or adsorbents.

A pentasil zeolite agglomerated in the form of 
hollow spheres and having a particle size of from 5 to 

200 micron. 
A pentasil zeolite agglomerated in the form of 
hollow spheres and having a particle size of from 10 to 

100 micron. 
A pentasil zeolite agglomerated in the form of 
hollow spheres and having a particle size of from 5 to 

200 micron, prepared by treating a mixture of an aqueous 
alkylenediamine, alkylenetriamine or alkylenetetramine, 

silica and an aluminum, boron or titanium salt at from 20 
to 100°C, subsequent crystallization at from 110 to 200°C 

and from 0.01 to 50 bar and calcination at from 400 to 
650°C. 
A process for the preparation of a pentasil 
zeolite agglomerated in the form of hollow spheres, as 

claimed in claim 1, wherein a mixture of an aqueous 
alkylenediamine, alkylenetriamine or alkylenetetramine, 

silica and an aluminum, boron or titanium salt is treated 
at from 20 to 100°C and the product is then crystallized 

at from 110 to 200°C and from 0.01 to 50 bar and calcined 
at from 400 to 650°C. 
A process for the preparation of a pentasil 
zeolite agglomerated in the form of hollow spheres, as 

claimed in claim 3, wherein the mixture contains an 
aqueous alkylenediamine, alkylenetriamine or alkylenetetramine, 

silica and an aluminum, boron or titanium salt 
and essentially no alkali metal compound or alkaline 

earth metal compound. 
A process for the preparation of a pentasil  
 

zeolite agglomerated in the form of hollow spheres, as 
claimed in claim 3, wherein an aqueous 20-75% strength 

solution of the alkylenediamine, alkylenetriamine or 
alkylenetetramine is used. 
A process for the preparation of a pentasil 
zeolite agglomerated in the form of hollow spheres, as 

claimed in claim 3, wherein triethylenetetramine, diethylenetriamine, 
dihexamethylenetriamine, dipropylenetriamine, 

propylenediamine, dipropylenetriamine, dihexamethylenetriamine, 
triethylenetetramine or diethylenetriamine 

is used as the alkylenediamine, alkylenetriamine 
or alkylenetetramine. 
Use of a pentasil zeolite agglomerated in the 
form of hollow spheres, as claimed in claim 1, as a 

catalyst or adsorbent.
