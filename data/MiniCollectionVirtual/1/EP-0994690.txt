<DESCRIPTION>
 HAIR TREATMENT COMPOSITIONSThis invention relates to hair treatment compositions containing particular types of functional silicones, which can generate certain conditioning benefits whilst according the composition good physical properties.The use of silicones as conditioning agents in hair treatment compositions is well known, and widely documented in the patent literature. However, a problem associated with such materials is that their use at levels necessary for achieving good tactile and/or visual benefits can make the hair too soft to style or retain a style. Fine hair in particular can appear limp and unmanageable.In certain circumstances, there may also be a tendency for some silicones to cause the hair treatment composition in which they are included to discolour, in particular over a period of time. In particular, it is usual for manufacturers of shampoos to wish to sell their products not only in clear containers, but also in colours which may be for example delicate pastel colours, or white. Some silicones have .been known to turn generally yellow on prolonged storage, thereby causing discoloration of the composition in which they are accommodated.We have found that the addition of a certain species of amidopolyether functional silicone may impart to a hair treatment composition certain benefits in terms of conditioning, in particular in so called leave on compositions, where a wet smooth benefit may be observed. In addition, the incorporation of the amidofunctional 

polymer may also avoid some of the disadvantages associated with incorporating other silicones in hair treatment compositions, such as discoloration which may come about after prolonged storage.Thus, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a hair treatment composition for topical application comprising an amidopolyether functional silicone of general formula (I);Me Me Me1 1 1Me3SiO - (SiO)ι - (SiO)n, - (SiO)„ -SiMe3 (I)1 1 1 
wherein Rl= (CH2 )2-(NH-(CH2)2)z-NH2, ancR2= (CH2 :)3- (NH- (CH2)2)=-N NHH--CCOO--CCH2-0-EOx- (CH2)y-CH3wherein 1 is in the region 100-1500, m is in the region 0- 10, n is in the region 2-50, x is in the region 1-40, y is in the region 0-21, and z is in the region 0-1. Preferably, 1+m is in the region 1-100.Preferably, 1 may be in the region 200-600. Preferably, m may be in the region 0-5. Preferably, n may be in the region 10-30. Preferably, x may be in the region 2-10. Preferably, y may be in the region 5-20.Suitable amidopolyether functional silicones for incorporating into hair
