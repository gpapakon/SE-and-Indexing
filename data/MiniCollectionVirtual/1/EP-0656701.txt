<ABSTRACT>
A communication apparatus capable of 
measuring levels of carrier signals used in 

adjacent zones during telecommunication with a 
small circuit scale, and capable of 

simultaneously transmitting/receiving to FDMA-system 
signals through a plurality of 

communication channels. All of transmission 
signals received through the c
ommunication 
channels under use are wholly converted into an 

intermediate signal by a mixer. The intermediate 
signal is quadrature-detected (24) and then A/D-converted 

into digital I/Q-channel signals by 
A/D-converters (26, 27). Thereafter, the digital 

I/Q-channel signals are frequency-converted by 
frequency converting circuits(43, 44) in such a 

manner that center frequencies of these I/Q-channel 
signals become zero, two sets of I/Q-channel 

signals may be demodulated by two sets of 
demodulating circuits (28). Otherwise, one of 

these I/Q-channel signals is demodulated by a 
single demodulating circuit(28), and the other is 

level-detected by a level detecting circuit (45).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
communication method/apparatus/system used in the
FDMA (frequency division multiple access)
transmission system. More specifically, the
present invention is directed to a communication
apparatus for receiving a carrier signal
transmitted from another base station during
telecommunication operation and/or for measuring
a level of this carrier signal, to communication
method/system for performing telecommunication
operation between a plurality of base stations as
well as mobile stations.Conventionally, the analog signal
transmission systems have been widely utilized in
the mobile telecommunication services such as
portable telephones and automobile telephones.
Very recently, the digital signal transmission
systems are commercially available in which as
the radio (wireless) accessing method, the TDMA
(time division multiple access) system for time-multiplexing
a plurality of users to transmit the
information with a single carrier frequency is
employed. In this TDMA system, the timing at
which one user receives the transmission signal
is present within a certain time range slot of 1
frame. The presently available mobile 
communication system is arranged by the cellular
telephone system. Accordingly, a mobile station
is required to have a judging function as to the
cell to which the own mobile station belongs. To
achieve this judging function, the reception
levels of the signals transmitted from the plural
base stations must be measured. When the same
frequency as that of the signal under
communication is used by another user belonging
to another cell, the interference signal levels
caused from this user would be increased. When
the interference signal levels exceed a
preselected SIR (signal-to-interference ratio),
the present communication channel is switched
into other communication channels with different
frequencies. As a consequence, the mobile
station is required to detect the levels of the
carrier signals used in the peripheral monitoring
zones which are designated by the base station
during the telecommunication.In accordance with the TDMA transmission
system, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the levels of
the reception signals from the peripheral zones
may be detected within the empty slot (namely,
level detecting slot) provided other than the
receiving slot and the transmitting slot. During
this empty slot, the frequency of the frequency
synthesizer is made coincident with the
designation carrier for monitoring the level, the
signal level detection is carried out
