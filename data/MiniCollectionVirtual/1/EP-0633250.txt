<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid, 
characterized in that
a) isonicotinic acid is oxidized to form isonicotinic acid-N-oxide, 
b) isonicotinic acid-N-oxide is reacted in the presence of an alkylating agent to form 
an N-alkoxy-isonicotinic acid salt, 
c) the salt is reacted by an alkali cyanide in an aqueous medium to form 2-cyanoisonicotinic 
acid, and 
d) 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid is obtained in an extremely pure form from this product 
by hydrolysis and by subsequently setting the pH to a value in the range of 

from 1 to 4. 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 isonicotinic acid in the presence 
of hydrogen peroxide is oxidized in acetic acid to form isonicotinic acid-N-oxide or in 

peracetic acid. 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 isonicotinic acid-N-oxide is 
reacted by means of a dialkyl sulphate, preferably dimethyl or diethyl sulphate, at from 

90 to 105Â°C to form an N-alkoxy-isonicotinic acid salt. 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the N-alkoxy isonicotinic acid 
salt formed is reacted in an aqueous solution [with]
 a sodium or potassium cyanide to 
form 2-cyanoisonicotinic acid. 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 sulphuric acid or hydrochloric 
acid is used for the acid hydrolysis of the 2-cyanoisonicotinic acid, and a pH in the 

range of from 1 to 4 is subsequently set with ammonia solution. 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 caustic potash solution or 
caustic soda solution is used for the alkaline hydrolysis of the 2-cyanoisonicotinic acid, 

and a pH in the range of from 1 to 4 is subsequently set with acid. 
2-cyanoisonicotinic acid  
 
Use of 2-cyanoisonicotinic acid as an intermediate product for the preparation of pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylic 
acid.
