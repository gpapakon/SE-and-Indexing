<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vacuum brake booster 
wherein the reaction force communicated through a reaction 
member is modified to establish a nonlinear relationship 
between the operator supplied input force for effecting a 
brake application and the resulting output force created 
in the brake booster. Traditionally the output force developed in a 
vacuum brake boosters is a linear function of an input 
force applied to the brake pedal. The input force applied 
to the brake pedal moves a plunger of a control valve to 
initially interrupt fluid communication between first and 
second chambers and thereafter allow a fluid to enter the 
first chamber to develop a pressure differential across a 
wall. The pressure differential acts on and moves the 
wall to develop the output force which is transmitted 
through a reaction member to an output member which 
correspondingly moves a piston in a master cylinder. The 
resistance of the piston to movement by the output force 
defines a reaction force which deforms the reaction member 
and balances the input force to establish the desired 
output force, U.S. Patent 3,110,031 is a typical example 
of one such brake boosters. Over the years many 
modification have been made to this type brake booster in 
an attempt to provide a better feel or a smoother 
operation during a brake application, such as changing the 
material in the reaction member by either making it harder 
or softer or as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,149,539 
changing both the shape of the plunger and reaction 
member. However, even with all these changes, the 
resulting output force remains a linear function of the 
input force. Recently the operational time required to effect 
the initiation of a brake application has been reduced by 
positioning a control valve in a brake booster in a ready 
or rest position by a key member to reduce the travel of a 
plunger by an input member as disclosed in U.S. Patent 
4,953,446. Consistent with traditional brake boosters,  
 
the resistance to movement developed by a piston in a 
master cylinder is transmitted through a reaction member 
to oppose the input force applied to move the plunger of 
the control valve. On further investigation of this 
vacuum brake booster, it has been determined that the 
operational time required to effect a brake application 
could be reduced through a modification of the 
relationship between the input force and output force. A reaction device as disclosed in Patent 
Abstracts of Japan, Volume 5, No. 143 (M-87) (815)

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A brake booster (10) having a plunger 
(52) located in a bore (30) of a movable wall (22) and 

responsive to an input force for controlling the flow of 
a first fluid to a first chamber (20) to create a 

pressure differential with a second fluid in a second 
chamber (18), said pressure differential acting on the 

movable wall (22) to develop an output force that is 
transmitted through a reaction member (48) to an output 

member (44) for moving a pressurizing device to effect a 
desired brake application, said pressurizing device 

resisting movement by the output force to develop a 
reaction force which is transmitted back through the 

reaction member (48) to oppose and neutralize the input 
force, said neutralization of the input force terminating 

the communication of the first fluid to said first 
chamber (20) to establish a limit on the pressure 

differential, said booster (10) being characterized by 
resilient means (200) having a lever (202) having a first 

end (204) and a second end (206), said lever (202) 
engaging a fulcrum (208) on said movable wall (22) to 

define a ratio of the distances between-the first (204) 
and second (206) ends and the fulcrum (208), said second 

end (206) engaging said plunger and a spring (210) 
connected to said first end (204), said lever (202) 

transferring a spring force to said plunger (52) through 
said first end (204), said spring force being combined 

with the input force during a brake application, said 
reaction force neutralizing the combined forces acting on 

said plunger (52) to develop an output force and effect a 
desired brake application, said spring force increasing 

as a function of the movement of said movable wall (22) 
to modify said reaction force such that the relationship 

between said input force and the output force varies as a 
nonlinear function. 
The brake booster (10) as recited in 
claim 1 further characterized by key means (64) for 

retaining said plunger (52) in said bore (30) and for  
 

limiting the movement of said plunger (52) by the 
reaction force. 
The brake booster (10) as recited in 
claim 2 wherein said key means (64) is characterized by 

retainer means (34) for holding the first end (204) of 
said lever (202) in a substantially fixed position with 

respect to said plunger (52). 
The brake booster (10) as recited in 
claim 3 wherein said key means (54) is further 

characterized by providing guidance to maintain said 
lever (202) in an axial plane as the movable wall (22) 

moves in response to the pressure differential. 
The brake booster (10) as recited in 
claim 4 further characterized by a clip member (212) 

connected to a rear shell (14) for retaining said spring 
(210).
