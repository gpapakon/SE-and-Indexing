<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head core for a magnetic head 
including first and second ferrite members (12,14) butted 

and bonded together to form an annular, closed magnetic 
path around a coil-winding groove (16), and a coil 

attached to a coil-winding portion (30) of the first 
ferrite member. The first and second ferrite members 

provide a sliding surface (22) to which a magnetic 
recording medium is opposed, and which extends across 

the first and second ferrite members. A non-magnetic 
material (32) is secured to at least one of an inner 

surface and an outer surface of the coil-winding portion 
(30). 

The non-magnetic material is located below 
the sliding surface, and is spaced apart from the 

magnetic recording medium with the sliding surface 
disposed between the non-magnetic material and the 

magnetic recording medium. Low inductance can be 
achieved, combined with high mechanical strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a 
magnetic head core which includes two ferrite members 
forming an annular, closed magnetic circuit, and in 
particular to a novel structure of such a magnetic head core 
which assures a reduced inductance and is suitably used with 
a recent magnetic recording medium having a relatively high 
recording density. To meet an increasing requirement for a high 
recording density of a magnetic recording medium, such as a 
floppy disk, a magnetic disk and a magnetic tape, there have 
been active research and developments particularly on a 
rigid magnetic disk drive which permits an increased density 
of information to be recorded per unit area of the magnetic 
recording medium, in an effort to realize a small-sized, 
high capacity and high-speed disk drive. A type of magnetic head used with a rigid disk 
drive (RDD), hard disk drive (HDD), floppy disk drive (FDD) 
and other devices has a magnetic head core, which includes a 
first ferrite member and a second ferrite member butted and 
bonded together to form an annular, closed magnetic path 
having a coil-winding aperture. The magnetic head core has a  
 
disk-sliding surface to be opposed to a magnetic recording 
medium, which surface is formed to extend across the two 
ferrite members. A coil is wound around the first ferrite 
member of the head core. However, the magnetic head core in which the 
annular, closed magnetic path is formed by the ferrite 
members suffers from undesirably great inductance, and 
cannot use high-frequency signals due to a limited resonance 
frequency. Thus, the known magnetic head core does not 
satisfy the requirement for high recording density of the 
magnetic recording medium. The inductance of the magnetic head core can be 
effectively reduced by reducing a cross sectional area of 
the ferrite members forming the magnetic path, as disclosed 
in JP-A-3-283008 filed by the assignee of the present 
application. However, it is difficult to sufficiently reduce 
the cross sectional area of the ferrite members since the 
ferrite members are fragile and the head core needs to be 
strong enough to endure stresses applied when the coil is 
wound around one of the ferrite members. Thus, it is 
extremely difficult for the known magnetic head core to 
exhibit a sufficiently low inductance. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a magnetic head core having a novel structure,  
 
which has a sufficiently low inductance while assuring a 
sufficiently high mechanical
