<ABSTRACT>
In order to determine whether in the case of a plastic bottle there are present in the region of the base of a bottle fatigue cracks which exclude the further use of the bottle, the measuring beam of a laser distance measuring device is applied to the base of the bottle in the region of the crack. The quantity and depth of the cracks can be detected from the output signal of the said device to the extent that it can be decided whether to take the bottle out of the reuse cycle.

Method for removing returnable bottles, in particular 
returnable plastic bottles (1), from circulation, characterized 

in that the bottles are conveyed past an optical 
distance-measuring instrument (5) essentially upon every 

bottle-return, so that the measuring beam (A) of the instrument 
scans the rim area of the bottom of the bottle, and in 

that the distance-measurement signal is evaluated and the 
individual bottle is removed from circulation or left in 

circulation depending on the outcome of the evaluation. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
distance-measuring instrument (5) also outputs a signal representing 

the reflected luminous intensity, and in that 
this signal is evaluated in addition to the distance-measurement 

signal so that the bottle (1) is removed from or 
left in circulation on the basis of both signals. 
Method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized 
in that the path of the measuring beam extends in a region 

of the bottle dome (3) at a distance of approximately 3 to 8 
mm from the base-surface (2). 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the distance-measuring instrument 

scans the bottle-bottom at an angle of approximately 45 
degrees to the longitudinal axis of the bottle. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the individual distance-measurement 

signal obtained is plotted over time and compared with an 
upper and a lower rating curve for evaluation purposes.  

 
Method according to any one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the individual light-intensity signal 

obtained is plotted over time and compared with an upper and 
a lower rating curve for evaluation purposes. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that at least two measuring beams, extending 

at different distances from the base-surface (2), are 
used. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the measuring beam scans the bottle-bottom 

in a circular path.
