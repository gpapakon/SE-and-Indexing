Delivery apparatus (1) for the transportation of gobs
of molten glass from a gob feeder (2) by way of a respective

delivery system (3) into moulds (4) of at least one glassware
forming machine (170),


wherein each delivery system (3) includes a scoop (8),
a trough (10) and a deflector (11),
wherein the scoop (8) is curved and the gobs coming from
the gob feeder (2) are caught and directed downwards at

an angle by the scoop into the trough (10),
wherein the trough (10) is at least approximately linear,
slopes downwards at an angle, is mounted in an

articulated manner relative to the machine at its upper
end (18) which receives the gobs and can be raised and

lowered at its lower end (23) which delivers the gobs to
the deflector (11) by means of an adjustment device (43),
and wherein the deflector (11) is curved, deflects the
gobs coming from the trough (10) downwards to be coaxial

with respect to the longitudinal axis (31) of the mould
(4), and by means of a setting device (52) is adjustable

in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (31)
of the mould (4), characterised in that the setting

device (52) for each deflector (11) comprises at least
one coupling member (54, 55; 119, 120) carrying the

deflector (11),
each coupling member (54, 55; 119, 120) makes possible
a relative swivelling movement of coupling member and

deflector (11) about an axis (53; 121) parallel to the
longitudinal axis (31) of the mould (4),
and each coupling member (54, 55; 119, 120) is adjustable
in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (31) 

of the mould (4).
Delivery apparatus according to claim 1, characterised
in that each coupling member (54, 55; 119, 120) is

displaceable lengthwise on a strut (56, 57; 124, 125) in the
plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (31) of the mould

(4), and the strut (56, 57; 124, 125) is swivellable about a
first swivel axis (60; 130) which is fixed relative to the

machine and which is parallel to the longitudinal axis (31)
of the mould (4).
Delivery apparatus according to claim 2, characterized
in that each coupling member (54, 55; 119, 120) is fixed to

a threaded sleeve (145) mounted to be longitudinally
displaceable on the strut (56, 57; 124, 125), and an axially

fixed first threaded spindle (113, 118; 126, 127) engages in
a thread (146) of the threaded sleeve (145).
Delivery apparatus according to claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that a nut (134) which is mounted to be

swivellable about a second swivel axis (136) parallel to the
first swivel axis (60; 130) is spaced from the first swivel

axis (60; 130) on the strut (56; 124), and an axially fixed
second threaded spindle (137) extends transversely to a

connecting line between the two swivel axes (60, 136; 130,
136) and perpendicular to the second swivel axis (136) and

engages in a threaded bore (135) in the nut (134).
Delivery apparatus according to claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that two spaced, aligned coupling members

(54, 55; 119, 120) are provided for each deflector (11),


both struts (56, 57; 124, 125) are fixed on a common
column (105, 129) swivellable about the first swivel axis

(60; 130),
and the two first threaded spindles (113, 118; 126, 127) 
of the coupling members (54, 55; 119, 120) are connected

to one another by a gear means (115; 128).
Delivery apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that a path of movement (13) of the

longitudinal axes of the gobs in the deflector (11) is a part
of a quarter ellipse (25), and wherein at a lower end (27) of

the deflector (11) a minor half axis (26) of the quarter
ellipse (25) lies horizontal and perpendicular to the path of

movement (13).
Delivery apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that a path of movement (13) of the

longitudinal axes of the gobs in the deflector (11) is a part
of a quarter circle (102), and wherein at a lower end (27) of

the deflector (11) a tangent (104) to the quarter circle (102)
is coaxial with respect to the longitudinal axis (31) of the

mould (4).
Delivery apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that a path of movement (13) of the

longitudinal axes of the gobs in the deflector (11) includes
in the direction of movement of the gobs first a part (167)

of a quarter circle (102) and thereafter tangentially to that
a part (169) of a quarter ellipse (25), and wherein at a lower

end (27) of the deflector (11) a minor half axis (26) of the
quarter ellipse (25) lies horizontal and perpendicular to the

path of movement (13).
Delivery apparatus according to claim 8, characterised
in that the quarter circle (102) approaches the quarter

ellipse (25) from the outside of the quarter ellipse (25).
Delivery apparatus according to one of claims 1 to
9, characterised in that a path of movement (13) of the

longitudinal axes of the gobs in the trough (10) merges 
tangentially into a path of movement (13) of the longitudinal

axes of the gobs in the deflector (11).
