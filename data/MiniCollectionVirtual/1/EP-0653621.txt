<ABSTRACT>
An ellipsometric method for process control in the context 
of device 

fabrication is disclosed. An ellipsometric signal is used to 
provide information about 

the device during the fabrication process. The information is 
used to better control 

the process. 
An ellipsometric signal of a particular wavelength 

is selected. 
The wavelength is chosen such that the absorption length of the light is 

a factor of about 5 to 20 less than the length of the optical path of 
the light through a film on the substrate. 

The 
signal is selected based on the composition and thickness of 

the films on the 
substrate through which the ellipsometric signal will pass before 

it is reflected from 
the substrate. Once the appropriate wavelength is determined, 

the ellipsometric 
signal is used to monitor the thickness of the films on the 

substrate over time, to 
assist in controlling the deposition and removal of films on 

the substrate, and to 
perform other process control functions in the context of device 

fabrication. The 
ellipsometric method is used to control the deposition and removal 

of films that 
underlie patterned masks with aspect ratios of 0.3 or more, that 

overlie topography 
on a substrate surface, or that both underlie a mask and overlie 

topography.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a process for fabricating integrated circuit
devices and in particular utilizing a measuring technique in conjunction with such
processes.The move towards smaller design rules for the fabrication of integrated
circuits is motivated by the desire to place a greater number of devices on a chip.
For advanced device structures, both the film thickness of layers used to form these
structures and the structure width must decrease as the number of devices on a chip
increase. The presence of these smaller features, which are smaller in width and in
thickness, has increased the complexity of fabricating integrated circuits. It is
especially difficult to control the etching process (for example) of an integrated
circuit when rapidly removing multiple layers of different materials from over a thin
layer which must not be substantially affected. Typically, such processes require
complex changes in processing conditions that must be made quickly.An ellipsometer is frequently used to determine the characteristics of
blanket films in the context of device fabrication. A beam of light is directed onto
the surface of the film. The ellipsometer measures the light reflected from the film.
From the reflected light the ellipsometer determines the angles DELTA (Δ) and PSI
(Ψ), which are defined as the change in phase of the light and the arc tangent of the
factor by which the amplitude ratio of the incident and reflected light in the direction
parallel to the plane of incident light changes, respectively. These quantities are then
used to determine the optical characteristics such as the index of refraction, the film
thickness, and the extinction coefficient of unpatterned, uniform films.The use of an ellipsometer to derive Δ and Ψ coordinates of a polarized
light beam reflected from a work piece to monitor the thickness of a film deposited
on a substrate is described in U.S Patent No. 5, 131,752 to Yu et al. Yu et al. first
calculate the endpoint, which is the point when film of the desired thickness has been
deposited, from the Δ and Ψ values of a film of the desired thickness. Yu et al.
calculate end point values of Δ and Ψ from the known angle of incidence, the
wavelength of the light source, the desired final film thickness, and the optical
constants of the substrate and film at the process temperature. Therefore, the Yu et 
al. method is limited to controlling a process in which the precise endpoint is known.In the context of device fabrication using masks or over topography, the

A process for fabricating a device comprising:

positioning a substrate with an irregular surface in a chamber, providing
an ellipsometric signal by generating the light signal and aiming the light signal at the

irregular surface of substrate;
determining a wavelength of light for the ellipsometric signal such that
the absorption length of the light in a film on the substrate is a factor of about 5 to about

20 less than the length of the optical path of the light through the film on the substrate;
observing an ellipsometric signal of the determined wavelength;
using the determined wavelength to generate an ellipsometric trace of Δ

defined as the change in phase of the light and the arc tangent of the
factor by which the amplitude ratio of the incident and reflected light in the direction

parallel to the plane of incident light changes, respectively; 
subjecting the substrate to conditions which change the thickness of the
film on the substrate;
