<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vibrating table for vibrating products occurring in layers or sheets, having at least two lateral stops (26), assigned to adjacent sides of a resting table (3), for the products, and having a portal frame (16) which can be moved in the plane of the resting table, which resting table can be set in a vibration movement and is inclinable from a horizontal position in the direction of the two stops. In order to allow a rapid, edge-precise alignment of the products to be vibrated with little use of energy, that is to say primarily little air throughput for separating the individual sheets of the layers of sheets, specifically to a great extent independently of the material structure of the products used, the vibrating table is characterised according to the invention essentially by   - an upper covering plate (21) mounted in the portal frame and arranged parallel to the surface of the resting table for receiving the products between said covering plate and the resting table, - means mounted in the portal frame for moving the upper covering plate perpendicular to the surface of the resting table, - blower devices (30, 31) for blowing air in between the layers of sheets, - at least one lateral covering plate (33) for covering the gap formed between the resting table and the upper covering plate.   The stack to be vibrated and to be aerated during this process is thus enclosed on all sides apart from an opening side to discharge the compressed air.
