<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle horn system (10) is disclosed which provides a plurality of different sounds, each indicative of the occurence of a different event. The horn system includes a vehicle horn (14), a horn switch (24), and a control circuit (12) having a plurality of inputs, one of which is coupled to the horn switch (24). Activation of the horn switch (24) causes the control circuit (12) to operate the horn (14) to produce a standard horn warning. Other events for which the horn system produces an audible alert include backing-up of the vehicle and changes in the vehicle alarm status. The horn system can include a vehicle alarm sensor (24) and a second vehicle horn (16) that produces a different sound than the first horn (14). The control circuit (12) is configured to operate only one of the horns when the vehicle is travelling below a certain speed and to operate both horns when the vehicle is travelling above that speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTI-SOUND VEHICLE HORN SYSTEMTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates in general to the use of sounds to convey information to a vehicle operator and to persons outside the vehicle. In particular, the invention relates to a vehicle horn system that uses the vehicle horn or horns not only as an audible warning to others, but also to alert the driver or others of the occurrence of an event, such as a change in the status of a vehicle alarm or that the vehicle is backing up. The invention also relates to a horn system that, upon activation of the horn switch, produces one of a pair of sounds depending upon vehicle speed.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe use of sound generating devices on vehicles to produce sounds that convey information to persons within and without the vehicle is well established. Devices employed to convey information to persons outside the vehicle include vehicle horns and, more recently, sound transducers used in vehicle alarm systems. Devices employed to convey information to occupants of the vehicle include buzzers or other sound transducers which indicate that, for example, a door is ajar, seat belts should be fastened, or the headlights have been left on. 

 For many years, the electric horns commonly used on automotive vehicles have been of the type which generate sound by vibration of a diaphragm driven by an electromagnet motor. The horn typically comprises a housing with the diaphragm peripherally clamped thereto forming a motor chamber. The coil of the electromagnet is mounted within the chamber and a magnetic pole piece on the housing extends axially of the coil. A magnetic plunger on the diaphragm extends toward the pole piece for imparting motion to the diaphragm in response to periodic energization of the coil. The diaphragm provides a resilient suspension of the plunger for reciprocating motion relative to the coil; it has a spring characteristic whereby the diaphragm and the mass carried by it have a resonant freguency of mechanical vibration. The coil is energized from the vehicle battery through a mechanically actuated switch which is alternately opened and closed by movement of the plunger with the diaphragm. A vehicle horn of this kind is sometimes referred to as a mechanically-switched type horn. A specific example of this type of horn is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,813,123, granted March 21, 1989 to Wilson et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.More recently, vehicle horns that employ a solid state driver circuit for the horn coil have

 What is claimed is:
1. In a vehicle horn system of the type having a vehicle horn and a horn switch coupled to said vehicle horn, the improvement comprising:
a control circuit coupled to said vehicle horn and having a plurality of inputs for providing said circuit with a plurality of input signals, said control circuit being operable to control the sound produced by said vehicle horn in accordance with the input signals;
wherein said horn switch is coupled to a first one of said plurality of inputs to thereby provide said control circuit with a first one of the input signals upon said horn switch being activated.
2. A vehicle horn system as defined in claim 1, wherein said vehicle horn has a resonant frequency of mechanical vibration and said control circuit is responsive to activation of said horn switch to operate said vehicle horn at said resonant frequency.
3. A vehicle horn system as defined in claim 2, further comprising a second vehicle horn having a second resonant frequency of mechanical vibration that is different than said first- mentioned resonant frequency, wherein said control circuit is coupled to said second vehicle horn and is operable to control the sound produced by said 


second vehicle horn in accordance with the input signals.
4. A vehicle horn system as defined in claim 3, further comprising a sensor coupled to a second one of said plurality of inputs, said sensor being operable to provide said second input with a signal representative of vehicle speed;
wherein said control circuit is configured to operate both of said vehicle horns when said horn switch is activated and the vehicle speed is greater than a predetermined value and, further, wherein said control circuit is configured to operate only one of said vehicle horns when said horn switch is activated and the vehicle speed is less than or equal to said predetermined value.
5. A vehicle horn system as defined in claim 1, wherein said vehicle horn is a mechanically-switched type horn.
6. A vehicle horn system as defined in claim 1, further comprising an electronically- switched type horn that includes an electric horn and an electronic switch for selectively supplying power to said electric horn.
7. A vehicle horn system as defined in claim 1, wherein certain ones of said plurality of inputs are connectable to a vehicle alarm system that provides said control circuit with a plurality 


of alarm control signals, each of which is associated with a different vehicle alarm condition, said control circuit being operable in response to the alarm control signals to cause said vehicle horn to produce a plurality of sounds, each indicative of a different one of said vehicle alarm conditions.
8. A vehicle horn system for selectively producing a plurality of different sounds, each of which is associated with a different event, comprising:
a vehicle horn; and
a control circuit having first and second inputs, said first input being connectable to a first electrical device that, via said first input, is capable of providing said control circuit with an indication of the occurrence of a first event, said second input being connectable to a second electrical device that, via said second input, is capable of providing said control circuit with an indication of the occurrence of a second event;
said control circuit being operable to cause said vehicle horn to produce a first sound when said first input is provided with an indication of the occurrence of said first event and, further, said control circuit being operable to cause said vehicle horn to produce a second sound when said 


second input is provided with an indication of the occurrence of said second event.
9. A vehicle horn system as defined in claim 8, further comprising a horn switch coupled to said first input to cause said control circuit to operate said vehicle horn when said horn switch is activated, whereby said first event is the activation of said horn switch.
10. A speed-responsive vehicle horn system, comprising:
