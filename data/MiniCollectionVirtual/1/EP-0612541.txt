<ABSTRACT>
In DE 39 04 722, a system was published, which consists of climbing plates of different geometrical shapes which are to be connected at any angular position via hinges which close without a gap. The aim of the present invention consists in further developing the system in DE 39 04 722 in such a manner that its variation possibilities are again significantly increased. In the construction system according to the invention, the "climbing plates" consist of supporting frames and textured plates which are to be mounted thereon and can be exchanged at any time. Moreover, it includes a rapid-closure system which automatically centres the hinges on assembly and can be secured in such a manner that even movable climbing walls become possible. The corner construction allows maximum utilisation of the hinge angles and the holes at the corners are closed by screw-in shaped parts. A special fastening system for screw-on grips allows, in addition to the rotation thereof, mounting at different inclinations also. Connection to commercially available scaffolding systems is achieved using adaptor pipes; base elements afford a stable standing surface and allow fastening of edge plates to a hall wall or ceiling.
