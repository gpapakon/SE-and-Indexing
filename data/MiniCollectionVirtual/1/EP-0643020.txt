<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to furnace 
combustion wherein heat is produced to heat a charge. Many industrial processes employ furnaces wherein 
fuel and oxidant are combusted to generate heat which 
is used to heat a charge within the furnace. Among 
such industrial processes one can name glassmaking 
wherein the charge is glassmaking materials or molten 
or solid glass, steelmaking wherein the charge is steel 
or iron and aluminum melting wherein the charge is 
aluminum ingots or scrap. In carrying out such furnace combustion it is 
desirable to completely combust the fuel within the 
furnace as this serves to maximize the amount of heat 
released within the furnace and available to heat the 
charge. Accordingly, oxidant and fuel may be provided 
into the furnace in a ratio which is not 
substoichiometric since a substoichiometric ratio would 
cause some of the fuel to remain unburned or would 
result in the generation of significant amounts of 
products of incomplete combustion such as carbon 
monoxide, hydrocarbons and carbon. At first glance it would appear that the optimum 
ratio for providing oxidant and fuel into a furnace for 
combustion is one that is substantially stoichiometric. 
However, in practice, such firing leads to some 
incomplete combustion because of less than perfect 
mixing of fuel and oxidant within the furnace and also 
because the reaction kinetics of the fuel and oxidant 
may not enable all of the fuel to completely combust  
 
prior to exiting the furnace. Accordingly, in actual 
industrial practice, furnaces of this type are operated 
with excess oxygen to ensure the complete combustion of 
the fuel within the furnace. Unfortunately, when 
furnaces are operated in this way, i.e., where oxidant 
and fuel are provided into the furnace in a 
superstoichiometric ratio, there arises the tendency to 
generate excessive levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
because oxygen in excess of that needed to react with 
the fuel becomes available to combine with nitrogen to 
form NOx. NOx is a significant pollutant and there 
exists a need to reduce the amount of NOx generated 
when carrying out combustion.  
 In a process for oxygen-enriched combustion of a fuel in an industrial furnace, e.g. a side port 
fired regenerative furnace, known from US-A-5 203 859, the fuel and preheated primary 
oxidant comprising between 85 % and 115 % of the total amount of oxygen required for 
complete combustion of the fuel are introduced into the furnace, producing a fuel/oxidant 
mixture and forming a

A method for carrying out combustion in a furnace (10) comprising: 

(A) providing fuel and oxidant in a substantially stoichiometric ratio into the 

furnace (10) which contains a charge (2) and which communicates with 
a flue system through an exhaust port (3) of the flue system; 
(B) combusting said fuel and oxidant within the furnace (10) to produce 
combustion reaction gases including carbon monoxide, and to generate 

heat for heating the charge (2); 
(C) passing the combustion reaction gases from the furnace (10) into and 
through the exhaust port (3) of the flue system; 
(D) injecting secondary oxidant; and 
(E) reacting the secondary oxidant with the carbon monoxide contained in 
the combustion reaction gases to produce carbon dioxide, 
 
characterized in that in steps (D) and (E) the secondary oxidant is injected into the 

exhaust port (3) at a velocity of at least 6 meter (20 feet) per second at a location 
where the temperature of the combustion reaction gases is at least 870 째C 

(1600 째F) and is reacted with the carbon monoxide contained in the combustion 
reaction gases within the exhaust port (3) of the flue system, said exhaust port 

having a smaller cross-sectional area than the cross-sectional area of the furnace

materials. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the secondary oxidant is injected into the exhaust 
port (3) of the flue system in a direction toward the furnace (10) counter to the 

flow direction of the combustion reaction gases passing through the exhaust port 
of the flue system. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the secondary oxidant has an oxygen concentration 
of at least 80 mole percent. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the temperature of the combustion reaction gases 
at the secondary oxidant injection location is at least 1090 째C (2000 째F).
