<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a fatty emulsion stabilized by a 
polysaccharide derivative, characterized in that the 

fatty emulsion contains a polysaccharide derivative which 
is substituted by a fatty acid or cholester
ol at a proÂ­
portion of 0.5-5 per 100 sugar units.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to emulsions used in 
medicine, food and the like, more particularly to fatty 
emulsions stabilized by polysaccharide derivatives 
which can embed fat-soluble substances in large 
quantities. As medicine carriers, albumin, fibrinogen, 
erythrocyte ghost, gelatin, starch, polylactide, 
polyglyceride, dextran, polyethyl carbonate, liposomes, 
emulsions and the like have been used. In these 
materials, liposomes and O/W emulsions are promising. It is well-known that, when the surface of a 
liposome is coated with a polysaccharide derivative by 
their mutual interaction of non-covalent bonds, the 
liposome structure is stabilized. (Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication Nos. 58-49311 and 61-69801). Lately, as mentioned above, liposomes and O/W 
emulsions are promising as medicine carriers. Among 
them, liposomes have disadvantages which are the lack 
of chemical and mechanical stabilities and the 
difficulty of long-term preservation. The present 
inventors found that the structural stability of 
liposomes was considerably improved by coating the 
liposome surface with a polysaccharide. However, a 
satisfactory stability is not yet obtained. On the other 
hand, on O/W emulsion comprising lecithin, oil and 
water is excellent as a carrier of fat-soluble  
 
medicines because it is possible to embed them in large 
quantities. Furthermore, fatty emulsions (lipid 
microsphere) have been conventionally prepared by 
emulsifying oil with phospholipids of negative electric 
charge for obtaining the colloid stability. When the 
surface electric charge of particles is neutralized by 
the presence of calcium ions and the like, the 
embedding of fat-soluble medicines, the pH change in 
the system, etc., these fatty emulsions tend to 
associate or aggregate. Accordingly, there are 
problems in regard of the colloid stability. The present inventors have conducted research for 
resolving the above problems and for stably emulsifying 
oil with emulsions other than phospholipids and they 
have found that oil is stably emulsified by using 
polysaccharide derivatives which can efficiently 
improve the structure stability of liposomes. Then, 
they have found fatty emulsions stablized by 
polysaccharide derivatives. An object of the present invention is to provide 
colloid-chemically and biochemically stable fatty 
emulsions which can embed and maintain fat-soluble 
materials in large quantities. The present invention provides a composition 
containing a polysaccharide derivative substituted by
