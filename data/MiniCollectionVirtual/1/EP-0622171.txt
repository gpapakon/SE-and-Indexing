<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a two-dimensional heating means of thermoplastic for producing surface welded joints between moulded pieces by converting electric current into Joulean heat in heating wire and to a method for producing said means in such a way that grooves (15.1, 75.1) are made in zones, that one or more heating wires (16, 76) are embedded therein, so that heating zones are formed in the two-dimensional heating means (18, 78), and that electric current can flow via terminal points (19, 79) through these one or more heating wires (16, 76) of the two-dimensional heating means (18, 78).
