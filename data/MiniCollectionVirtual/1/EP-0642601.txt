<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water 
electrolyzers, and especially to water electrolyzers 
which can operate under high pressure gradients. Ion exchange membrane water electrolyzers for 
producing hydrogen and oxygen from water have been known 
for more than 20 years. The electrolyzer's components 
typically include chambers for the introduction of water 
and the removal of hydrogen, oxygen, and water, an ion 
exchange membrane disposed between catalyst electrodes, 
and metal screens which support the ion exchange 
membrane and form the chambers. Referring to Figure 1 
which is illustrative of a common water electrolyzer 
component arrangement, a first metal screen set 1 which 
forms the anode chamber is located above the catalytic 
anode electrode 7 which intimately contacts the ion 
exchange membrane 5. The opposite side of the ion 
exchange membrane 5 intimately contacts a catalytic 
cathode electrode 9, which lies above a second metal 
screen set 3 which forms the cathode chamber. During operation, water enters the anode chamber 
formed by the first metal screen set 1. The water 
passes through the first metal screen set 1 and 
intimately contacts the anode electrode 7. At the anode 
electrode 7, electrolysis converts the water to hydrogen 
ions and oxygen. These hydrogen ions migrate across the 
ion exchange membrane 5 while the oxygen passes through 
the first metal screen set 1, enters the water stream, 
and exits the electrolyzer 10. Once across the ion  
 
exchange membrane 5, the hydrogen ions form molecular 
hydrogen at the cathode electrode 9 and exit the 
electrolyzer 10 through the second metal screen set 3. 
This reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 1, mechanism 
A. The metal screens of the water electrolyzer perform 
numerous functions. Generally, a low pressure gradient 
is permitted across the ion exchange membrane within the 
electrolyzer in order to simplify the system pressure 
controls. Often, up to about 1.38MPa (200 per square inch 
(psi)) of pressure exists across the ion exchange 
membrane during electrolyzer operation. Since the ion 
exchange membrane possesses low structural integrity, 
the pressure gradient across the ion change membrane 
can cause failure thereof. Therefore, the natal screens 
are used to provide structural support to the ion 
exchange membrane during operation. These metal screens 
also form flow paths for the water, oxygen, and 
hydrogen, and they conduct electrons utilized during the 
water electrolysis to and from the electrodes, into 
adjacent
