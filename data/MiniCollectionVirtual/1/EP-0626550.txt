<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for carrying out a physical and/or chemical 
process, such as a heat exchanger, comprising a reservoir 

provided with upwardly-directed tubes, which tubes are in open 
communication with a top box and a bottom box, in which bottom 

box at least one distribution plate is arranged for supporting 
a fluidized bed consisting of granular material. The invention 

further comprises means for feeding fluidized bed particles 
back from the top box to the bottom box. At the bottom end, 

the bottom box is provided with a bottom pot (6) having a 
deepened bottom (9) for collecting thereon pollutions from the 

main flow fed via a feed line (5, 5A) laterally extending into 
the bottom pot (6), the collected pollutions being removable 

from the bottom pot (6) by means of a conduit system (10, 14) 
which discharges a portion of the main flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for carrying out a 
physical and/or chemical process, such as a heat exchanger, 
comprising a reservoir provided with upwardly-directed tubes 
accommodated, at the top and bottom ends thereof, in tube 
plates, and which are in open communication with a top box and 
a bottom box, in which bottom box at least one distribution 
plate is arranged for supporting a fluidized bed consisting of 
granular material and capable of being held in a quasi-stationary, 
fluidized condition by means of a medium to be 
treated or heated or cooled which is supplied via the bottom 
box and flows through the tubes, which apparatus further 
comprises means for feeding fluidized bed particles back from 
the top box to the bottom box. Such an apparatus is disclosed in EP-B-0.065.333. In this 
known apparatus, the means for feeding fluidized bed particles 
back from the top box to the bottom box consist of downcomers 
arranged within the reservoir of the apparatus, via which 
downcomers a portion of the fluidized bed particles can be 
brought into, and maintained in, circulation. This internal 
circulation of fluidized bed particles serves for cleaning the 
inner surfaces of the riser pipes, which, in the case where a 
strongly polluted medium is treated or heated or cooled, may 
undergo a strong pollution. In this connection, the internal 
circulation and vortex action of the solid particles provide 
for the cleaning of the riser pipes.  
 Although this known apparatus is highly satisfactory in a 
large number of cases, one drawback can be pointed out which 
needs improvement. This drawback is the following: Hereinabove, it is observed that on the pipe side, the 
known apparatus generally involves a very strongly polluted 
medium. This means that the medium itself may contain solid 
parts of considerable dimensions, or that the feed lines 
upstream of the heat exchanger may be subject to pollution due 
to, for instance, incrustation, which crusts may break off 
from the walls of these conduits, for instance due to 
temperature changes in the process, to be subsequently carried 
along to the heat exchanger. This heat exchanger contains, in 
the bottom box thereof, at least one distribution plate for 
supporting the fluidized bed, and although the distribution 
plates are provided with large holes in a specific pattern or 
with spray heads which are reasonably well permeable, there is 
still the danger that the above-mentioned pollutions may stop 
up the distribution plates, so that the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for carrying out a physical and/or chemical 
process, such as a heat exchanger, comprising a reservoir 

provided with upwardly-directed tubes accommodated, at the top 
and bottom ends thereof, in tube plates, and which are in open 

communication with a top box and a bottom box, at least one 
distribution plate being arranged in said bottom box for 

supporting a fluidized bed consisting of granular material and 
capable of being held in a quasi-stationary, fluidized 

condition by means of a medium to be treated or heated or 
cooled which is supplied via the bottom box and flows through 

the tubes, said apparatus further comprising means for feeding 
fluidized bed particles back from the top box to the bottom 

box, characterized in that the bottom box, at the bottom end 
thereof, is provided with a bottom pot (6) having a deepened 

bottom (9) for collecting thereon pollutions from the main 
flow supplied via a feed line (5, 5A) laterally extending into 

the bottom pot (6), the collected pollutions being removable 
from the bottom pot (6) by means of a conduit system (10, 14) 

discharging a portion of the main flow and having connected 
thereto a settling reservoir or filter (12), of which conduit 

system one end (10) ends at a distance above the deepened 
bottom (9) and the other end (14) is connected to the main 

feed line (3) at the suction side of the main flow supply pump 
(4). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the bottom pot (6) is enlarged relative to the bottom box (5),  

 
the feed line for the main flow extending tangentially into 

the bottom pot (6). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the bottom pot (6) has the same diameter as the bottom box 

(5), the feed line (5A) for the main flow extending centrally 
into the bottom pot (6), having a downwardly directed mouth. 
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1-3, 
characterized in that between the main flow feed line (3, 3A, 

3B) and the conduit system (10, 14) discharging a portion of 
the main flow, a bypass with a valve (8) is arranged for 

periodically conducting a partial flow to the end (10) of the 
conduit system (10, 14) in a direction opposite to the usual 

direction of flow, for remedying blockages, if any, in said 
end (10).
