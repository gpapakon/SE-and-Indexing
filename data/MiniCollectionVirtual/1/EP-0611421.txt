<ABSTRACT>
A disc brake caliper (10) has two limbs (11, 12) which in use straddle on outer periphery of a brake disc (15) to support friction pads (22) on each side of the disc. Each caliper limb (11, 12) supports at least two friction pads (22A, 22B, 22C) arranged side by side in a circumferentially sequential array with the trailing edges of each pad abutting the leading edge (27L, 28) of any circumferentially adjacent pad in the array to transmit torque loads from one pad to the adjacent pad.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disc brakes for motor vehicles and 
in particular but not exclusively to disc brakes for high 
performance cars or motor cycles. In a typical disc brake, a brake caliper straddles the outer 
peripheral margin of a brake disc, the caliper having at 
least one hydraulic cylinder therein for applying friction 
pads to each side of the disc. The calipers are of two basic 
types, fixed calipers which have hydraulic cylinders on both 
sides of the disc, and moving calipers in which typically the 
hydraulic cylinder(s) is on one side of the disc for direct 
application of friction pad(s) on that side of the disc, and 
the friction pads on the other side of the disc are applied 
by the reaction movement of the caliper. EP-A-0061107 discloses a disc brake caliper having disc brake 
pads directly abutting each other there being a pair of pads 
on each side of the disc. However there is no disclosure of each pad being forced into 
engagement with the disc by at least one individual hydraulic 
piston.  
 With disc brakes of the type fitted to high performance 
vehicles, particularly racing cars or motor cycles, the 
friction pads are extended over a relatively long arc to 
maximise the area of friction material in contact with the 
disc. When the brakes are applied, the leading edge of the 
pads tends to "grab" onto the disc and in the extreme 
conditions which these brakes operate, the leading edges and 
areas of the pads wear faster than the trailing areas. Also due to the arcuate length of the pads, as the pads heat 
up during braking they tend to buckle due to internal 
expansion causing heat spotting of the friction material 
followed by material fade. One way of compensating for the uneven wear has been to 
provide a plurality of hydraulic cylinders in the caliper, 
with the cylinders at the leading areas of the pad being of a 
smaller diameter than the cylinders at the trailing areas of 
the pad so that the leading edge area of the pad is applied 
to the disc by a smaller load than the trailing edge areas. It is an object of the present invention to provide a disc 
brake caliper which mitigates the above problems.  
 Thus according to the present invention there is provided a 
disc brake caliper (10) having two limbs (11,12) which in use 
straddle an outer periphery of a brake disc (15) to support 
friction pads (22A,22B,22C) on each side of the disc 
wherein each caliper limb (11,12) supports at 
least two friction pads (22A,22B,22C) arranged side by side 
in a circumferentially
