<ABSTRACT>
A surgical scalpel (100) has a hollow handle (101) 
provided with a cleat (104), and the cleat (104) has a rib 

(105) for mounting a blade (106). A guard (107) is 
telescopically received within the hollow handle (101) for 

sliding movement therein. The guard (107) has an advanced 
position in which the blade (106) is covered and an alternate 

retracted position in which the blade is exposed for use 
during a surgical procedure. The guard (107) is an inverted 

U-shaped channel including a pair of side walls (109, 110) 
having respective closed longitudinal slots (122, 123) formed 

therein. A pin (121) is carried by the handle (101) 
transversely thereof and is received in the closed 

longitudinal slots (122, 123), thereby providing a bearing 
guide means and a stop means (120) between the guard (107) and 

the handle (101). A resiliently-based detent means (113) is 
provided between the guard (107) and the handle (101), and the 

detent means (113) is independent of the stop means (120).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical scalpel and, 
in particular, to a surgical scalpel having a retractable 
blade guard to protect against inadvertent nicks or cuts 
during a surgical procedure in an operating room. In European Patent Application EP-A-555196, a guarded surgical scalpel 
is disclosed and claimed, wherein a guard is mounted on the 
scalpel handle for alternate sliding movement thereon between an 
advanced position in which the blade is covered and a retracted 
position in which the blade is exposed, thereby protecting 
against inadvertent nicks or cuts when the scalpel is being 
transferred from the surgeon to the nurse, and vice-versa, during 
a surgical procedure in an operating room. Detent means are 
provided between the guard and the handle, thereby defining 
the alternate positions of the guard with respect to the handle. 
Stop means are also provided between the guard and the 
handle to form a bearing guide between the guard and the handle 
and to preclude an accidental removal of the guard from the 
handle, the stop means being independent of the detent means. 
Preferably, the stop means includes a pin carried transversely of the handle 
and riding in a closed longitudinal slot in the guard. The present invention constitutes an improved guarded 
surgical scalpel having a handle with a blade mounted thereon. 
In accordance with the improvement, the handle is 
substantially hollow and has a sliding guard telescopically 
mounted therein. More particularly, the invention is directed to a guarded 
surgical scalpel having a handle with a blade mounted thereon 
wherein the handle is substantiallky hollow and wherein there is 
provided an inverted U-shaped guard telescopically mounted within 
the handle for sliding movement therein. There is also provided a 
two-position resiliently biased detent means between the guard 
and the handle, thereby defining an advanced position of the 
guard in which the blade is substantially covered and an 
alternate retracted position of the guard in which the blade is 
exposed. There is also provided a bearing guide means between the 
guard and the handle, the bearing guide means being independent 
of the detent means and providing a stop means limiting the 
sliding movement of the guard. The guard is formed as an inverted U-shaped 
channel, preferably having a pair of side walls, each of which has a 
preferably closed 
longitudinal slot formed therein for receiving the pin.  
 The handle includes a lower member having a 
longitudinally-extending

<CLAIMS>
A guarded surgical scalpel (100) having a handle 
(101) with a blade (106) and a guard (107) mounted thereon; a 

two-position resiliently-biased 
detent means (113) between the guard (107) and the handle 

(101), thereby defining an advanced position of the guard 
(107) in which the blade (106) is substantially covered and an 

alternate retracted position of the guard (107) in which the 
blade (106) is exposed, and bearing guide means between 

the guard (107) and the handle (101), the bearing guide means 
being independent of the detent means (113) and 

providing a stop means (120) limiting the sliding movement of 
the guard (107) characterized by the handle (101) being substantially 

hollow, and the guard (107) being inverted U-shaped and telescopically 
mounted within the handle (101) for sliding movement therein. 
The guarded surgical scalpel of claim 1, wherein the 
stop means (120) comprises a pin (121) carried by the handle 

(101) transversely thereof, and wherein the guard (107) has a 
pair of parallel side walls (109, 110), each of which has a 

longitudinal slot (122, 123) formed therein and 
receiving the pin (121). 
The guarded surgical scalpel of claim 2, further 
characterized in that the longitudinal slots (122, 123) are 

closed at rich end thereof, such that the bearing guide means 
provides a stop means (120) for limiting the alternate 

advanced and retracted positions of the guard (107) with 
respect to the handle (101), the stop means (120) being 

independent of the detent means (113). 
The guarded surgical scalpel (100) of claim 1, 
further characterized in that the detent means (113) comprises 

a detent member (114) carried by one of the handle (101) and 
guard (107), and the other of the handle (101) and guard (107) 

having a longitudinal slot (117) receiving the detent member 
(114). 
The guarded surgical scalpel (100) of claim 4, 
further characterized by the longitudinal slot (117) having a  

 
pair of spaced-apart detent pockets (118, 119) for alternately 

receiving the detent member (114). 
The guarded surgical scalpel (100) of claim 5, 
further characterized by a detent button (111) disposed above 

the handle (101), the detent button (111) releasing the detent 
member (114) from a respective detent pocket (118, 119). 
The guarded surgical scalpel (100) of claim 6, 
further characterized in that the longitudinal slot (117) 

receiving the detent member (114) is formed in the top (101A) 
of the handle (101). 
The guarded surgical scalpel (100) of claim 1, 
further characterized in that the handle (101) includes a 

lower member (101B) having a longitudinally-extending section 
constituting a cleat (104), and wherein the cleat (104) is 

provided with a rib (105) for mounting the blade (106) 
thereon.
