<ABSTRACT>
A tape data recording and reproducing system is disclosed which has an over-writing capability which can result in previously recorded data continuing to exist on the tape after the over-writing has been completed. The present invention uses cyclical redundancy check data that is normally recorded with the data to determine if the data recovered during reproducing is valid data.

financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing power of these high- performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster than the ability of storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid retrieval is particularly pronounced in computational-intensive applications which create huge
