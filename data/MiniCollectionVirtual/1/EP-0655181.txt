<ABSTRACT>
An optical projector arrangement comprises a light source (1) light from which is formed a collimated beam travelling along an axis (5) by optics (2, 4). The light is split into red, green and blue components travelling in different paths by a splitter (8), these being subsequently recombined by a synthesiser (30) to continue along the axis (5) to a projection lens (32). A respective liquid crystal modulator (22, 23, 25) is included in each different path. In order to increase the optical length of the path taken by the green component to be equal to the lengths of the paths (7, 9) taken by the red and blue components, a path length compensator (34) is included in the path for the green component, which path would otherwise be along the axis (5) for the whole of its length.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL PROJECTOR ARRANGEMENTThis present invention relates to an optical projector arrangement comprising a light source, an optical system for forming light from the source into a parallel beam travelling along a given axis in a given direction, a beam splitter and a beam synthesiser positioned in succession in the given direction along the given axis, the beam splitter being constructed and arranged for receiving the parallel beam travelling along the given axis, splitting it into first, second and third spectral components, and launching these components into first, second and third paths respectively to the beam synthesiser, the beam synthesiser being constructed and arranged for receiving the first, second and third spectral components travelling along the first, second and third paths respectively and combining them into a synthesised beam travelling along the given axis in the given direction, the total paths for the first and second components through the arrangement being of equal optical length, the first and second paths each having an initial portion which extends away from the given axis in a respective direction which is perpendicular to the given axis and the third path having initial and final portions which both extend along the given axis in the given direction, a first reflector arrangement constructed and arranged for receiving the first spectral component from the initial portion of the first path and directing it into a central portion of the first path which extends in the given direction parallel to the given axis and thereafter into a final portion of the first path which extends towards the given axis in a direction perpendicular thereto, a second reflector arrangement constructed and arranged for receiving the second spectral component from the initial portion of the second path and directing it into a central portion of the second path which extends in the given direction parallel to the given axis and thereafter into a final portion of the second path which extends towards the given axis in a direction perpendicular thereto, first, second and third liquid crystal light modulators included in the first, second and third paths respectively, and a projection lens for receiving the synthesised beam, 

 A known arrangement of this general kind is disclosed in United States patent number 4,850,685, and is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1 of the accompanying diagrammatic drawings.Referring to Figure 1 it will be seen that, in the known projector arrangement, light from a light
