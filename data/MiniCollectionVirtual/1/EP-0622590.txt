<ABSTRACT>
A gas cooking hob comprises one or more gas burners, a pivotally 
mounted lid 12 adapted to cover the gas burners, a hinge mechanism for 

effecting the pivotal mounting of the lid 12, and a gas cut-off valve 17 for cutting 
off the gas supply to the gas burners when the lid 12 is closed, the gas cut-off 

valve 17 being mounted on the hinge mechanism (Fig. 1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cooking hobs and more particularly to gas 
cooking hobs which are provided with a pivoted lid or cover which covers the 
upper surface of the hob. Lidded gas cookers are known which comprise a gas hob having a number 
of gas burners, a lid or cover which is pivotally mounted and movable between 
a closed position where it covers the gas burners, and a raised position which 
permits access to the gas burners, and one or more oven, oven/grill, or grill 
cavities above which the gas hob is mounted. In such gas cookers it is known 
to incorporate a gas cut-off valve or gas cut-off safety valve as disclosed, for 
example, in EP 0221655B, to cut off the gas supply to the gas burners when the 
lid is closed to obviate problems which could arise should one or more of the gas 
burners have inadvertently been left on. In such gas cookers a direct mechanical 
link is provided between either the lid or more typically the hinge of the lid and 
the operating rod or lever of the gas cut-off valve which is mounted on the gas 
hob or gas cooker. This is perfectly satisfactory where the lid is an integral part 
of the gas hob or gas cooker. However, it is becoming popular to provide a gas hob, either with or 
without an integral oven cavity, with a separate lid or cover, the gas hob 
typically being mounted in a hole in a kitchen cabinet work surface and the lid 
being mounted on the work surface rather than on the gas hob. In such an 
arrangement the relative positions of the gas hob and lid can change and it is not 
practicable to provide a direct mechanical link between them in order to operate 
the gas cut-off valve or gas safety cut-off valve. It is an object of the present invention to provide a gas hob having a 
separate lid with an improved operating mechanism which overcomes 
disadvantages associated with present mechanisms. According to the present invention there is provided a cooking hob having 
one or more gas burners, a pivotally mounted lid adapted to cover said gas  
 
burners, a hinge mechanism for effecting the pivotal mounting of said lid, and 
a gas cut-off device for cutting off the gas supply to the gas burners when said 
lid is closed and covers said burners, said hinge mechanism comprising a first 
part which is fixedly secured to a support and a second part for supporting said 
lid which is pivotally mounted on said first part, said gas cut-off device being 
mounted on said first part of said hinge mechanism, said second part of said 
hinge mechanism having means, e.g.

A cooking hob having one or more gas burners, a pivotally mounted 
lid adapted to cover said gas burners, a hinge mechanism for effecting the pivotal 

mounting of said lid, and a gas cut-off device for cutting off the gas supply to 
the gas burners when said lid is closed and covers said burners, said hinge 

mechanism comprising a first part which is fixedly secured to a support and a 
second part for supp
orting said lid which is pivotally mounted on said first part, 
said gas cut-off device being mounted on said first part of said hinge mechanism, 

said second part of said hinge mechanism having means for operating said cut-off 
device. 
A cooking hob as claimed in claim 1, in which said gas cut-off device 
is formed as an integral part of said hinge mechanism. 
A cooking hob as claimed in claim 1, in which said gas cut-off device 
comprises a body portion which is separate from said hinge mechanism but 

which is mounted thereon. 
A cooking hob as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the said 
second part of said hinge mechanism comprises cam means for operating said 

cut-off device. 
A cooking hob as claimed in claim 4, in which said first part of said 
hinge mechanism is adapted to be fixed to a kitchen worktop. 
A cooking hob as claimed in claim 5, in which the mounting of said 
first part of said hinge mechanism is adjustable. 
A cooking hob as claimed in any preceding claim, in which said gas 
cut-off device comprises a pressure operated gas cut-off valve. 
A cooking hob as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, comprising a 
pressure operated safety valve connected to the gas outlet of said gas cut-off 

device.
