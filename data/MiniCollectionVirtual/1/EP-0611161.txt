<ABSTRACT>
Power or ground voltage can fluctuate when many high 
capacitance terminals of an integrated circuit device move 

simultaneously from one logic state to another. This occurs 
particularly after release of a global high impedance state of 

output buffers where output signals have been passively driven to 
a selected logic state. To prevent supply and ground voltage 

variations, the buffers are provided with means for operating in a 
slow response (high slew) mode. A slew rate control circuit (229) moves 

the buffer (21) to slow response mode in response to the high impedance 
signal (GTSB). When the slew race control circuit (229) receives a signal 

ending the high impedance state of the buffer (21), it applies a delay 
to this signal, and after the delay time allows the buffer (21) to move 

to a fast response mode. The slow buffer response and resulting 
slow voltage change when high capacitance terminals move to a new 

logic state prevents fluctuation of power or ground voltage in 
response to simultaneous switching of many terminals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to circuitry for 
controlling buffers in an integrated circuit device, 
particularly output buffers which might be switched 
simultaneously. The invention relates to many kinds of integrated 
circuit devices, for example application specific gate array 
devices, PLAs, microprocessors, and custom integrated circuit 
devices. However, the invention will be described in 
connection with field programmable integrated circuit devices 
(FPGAs) which will be described in some detail here. FPGAs 
such as those made by Xilinx, Inc. comprise programmable 
elements and interconnect devices which are programmed by 
turning on selected transistors. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings, in 
which Fig. 1 shows the architecture of a prior art FPGA 
integrated circuit device made by Xilinx, Inc., and Fig. 2 
shows an input/output buffer (IOB) in a Xilinx FPGA. Referring to Fig. 1, around the perimeter of the chip 
are input/output buffers (IOBs) such as IOB1 through IOB8. 
In the interior of the chip are configurable logic blocks 
(CLBs) such as CLB1 through CLB4. Also in the interior of 
the chip are switch boxes such as SB1 through SB4. For 
simplicity, only a few IOBs, CLBs and switch boxes are 
labelled. Not shown in Fig. 1 is a structure of interconnect 
lines which run horizontally and vertically from one switch 
box to another. Also not shown are input and output lines 
which extend outward from the CLBs in all four directions. 
However, dots in Fig. 1 represent programmable connections 
from the interconnect lines in the interconnect structure to 
lines extending from the CLBs. The switch boxes include a 
plurality of programmable transistors which can connect  
 
one line entering the switch box to other lines entering the 
switch box. A data book entitled "The Programmable Gate Array 
Data Book", ©1992 available from Xilinx, Inc. at 2100 Logic 
Drive, San Jose, CA 95124 describes these IOBs, CLBS and switch 
boxes in more detail. Such devices are also described in Freeman 
U.S. Patent 4,870,302, incorporated herein by reference. Functions performed by the CLBS are selectable, and the 
interconnections between IOBs and CLBs are selectable. Certain of 
the IOBs have special functions, and during configuration are used 
for loading the bit stream for configuring the remainder of the 
chip. After configuration is complete these IOBs used for 
configuration act as other IOBs. Most external pins are connected 
to pads which connect to IOBs. However, certain external pins
