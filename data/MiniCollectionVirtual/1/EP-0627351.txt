<ABSTRACT>
Electrical push contact for full or semi-automatic railway couplings comprises a carrying sleeve (1) which can be inserted into a receptacle hole (2) of a plastic carrying plate (3) of the coupling and a sliding sleeve (4) which can be lifted off in the carrying sleeve from a radially inwardly protruding shoulder (7) of the carrying sleeve (1) counter to the force of a spring (5), and can be mounted in an axially displaceable fashion. The latter is provided with a contact pin (8) which protrudes axially out of the carrying sleeve (1) on the shoulder side, is of hollow construction and comprises at the end a finished contact plate (11) and a section of a flexible cable (14) which is connected with one of its ends to the contact pin (8) at its end which is remote from the contact plate (11), and axially penetrates the sliding sleeve (4). The other end of the cable is connected to a rear connection element (17) which is secured in the carrying sleeve (1). A particularly simple, cost-effective push contact design is obtained if at least the carrying sleeve (1) is formed from plastic and if the contact pin (8) of the sliding sleeve (4) has an axial hole (9) into which a metallic contact sleeve (10) can be inserted into the end from the outside, the metal contact sleeve (10) bearing the finished contact plate (11) at the end and being capable of being connected at its rear end to one end of the cable by means of a crimp connection (15).
