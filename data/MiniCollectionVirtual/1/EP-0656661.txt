<ABSTRACT>
A vertical MOSFET, which can control AC current 
flowing through a device only by the gate voltage, is 

obtained. On an n⁺ silicon layer 11 is formed an n⁻ silicon 
layer 12. Within the n⁻ silicon layer 12 is formed a p-body 

region 13. Within the p-body region 13 is formed an n⁺ 
source region. On top of a substrate
 are formed a source 
electrode 191 in contact only with the source region 14 and 

a base electrode 21 in contact only with the p-body region 
13. The source electrode 191 and the base electrode 21 are 

connected to each other through a resistance at the outside. 
On a channel region 18 is formed a gate electrode 6 through 

a gate oxide film (insulating film) 16. When the above 
semiconductor device is in the reverse bias conduction, the 

exciting current is controlled only by the gate voltage by 
setting the current flowing from a source terminal S through 

the resistance to the base electrode 21, the p-body region 
13 and the n⁻ silicon layer 12 to be negligibly small as 

compared with the current flowing from the source terminal 
S through the source electrode 191 to the n⁺ source region 

14, the channel region 18 and the n⁻ silicon layer 12.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
semiconductor device. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a semiconductor device having a
vertical MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect
Transistors) structure.FIG. 12 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the
structure of a conventional n-channel type DMOSFET (Diffused
self-alignment MOSFET). In this figure, a semiconductor
substrate 125 is composed of two layers, an n+ silicon layer
111 and an n- silicon layer 112, and substrate 125 operates
as a drain region. By forming a gate electrode 117 on top
of the semiconductor substrate 125 with a gate oxide film
(insulating film) 116 disposed therebetween and doubly
diffusing p-type impurities and n-type impurities using the
gate electrode 117 as a common mask, a p-body region 113 and
an n+ source region 114 are formed. A channel region 118 is
defined within the surface region of the p-body region 113.
A source electrode 119 is formed all over the top of the
semiconductor substrate 125 to be electrically connected to
the p-body region 113 and the n+ source region 114. A metal
drain electrode 120 is formed all over the bottom of the 
semiconductor substrate 125 so as to be electrically
connected to the n+ silicon layer 111. The gate electrode
117, the source electrode 119 and the drain electrode 120
are connected to a gate terminal G, a source terminal S and
a drain terminal D, respectively.Now, the operational principal of this prior art
transistor will be described.First, the case where the transistor is forwardly
biased will be described. When a main voltage is applied in
such a way that the drain terminal D is high in electrical
potential and the source terminal S is low in electrical
potential and a forward bias is applied to the gate terminal
G, an inversion layer is formed within the channel region
118, and electrons flow from the n+ source region 114 through
the channel region 118 into the n- silicon layer 112. As a
result of this flow of electrons, electronic current
(control current) 121 flows and the transistor is turned to
the ON state. FIG. 13 is a graph illustrating the relation
between drain current ID, i.e., electronic current 121, and
drain-source voltage VDS. The details of the electric
characteristics when the transistor is in the ON state with
forward conduction are illustrated in the first quadrant of
FIG. 13. As the voltage VDS increases, the current ID
increases and becomes saturated at a certain current value.
When gate-source voltage VGS is increased, a
