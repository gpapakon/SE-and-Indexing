<ABSTRACT>
An installation for compacting concrete mix comprises 
a frame which has a lower plate (12) and an upper plate (9) between 

which concrete mix can be accommodated, which plates can be 
pressed in the direction towards one another and can be made to 

vibrate with respect to one another in order to compact the 
mix. Each plate (9,12) is connected to the frame (1,2) by means of an 

associated spring-mounted (3,5) massive body (4,6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an installation for compacting 
concrete mix, comprising a frame which has a lower plate and an 
upper plate between which concrete mix can be accommodated, 
which plates can be pressed in the direction towards one 
another and can be made to vibrate with respect to one another 
in order to compact the mix. An installation of this type is disclosed in 
Netherlands Patent Application NL-A 8,004,995. As a result of 
the use of a hydraulic vibrating element and a hydraulic press 
installation, it is possible, using this known installation, to 
obtain a desired, predetermined vibration/time curve which is 
suited to the product to be formed, such that the concrete mix 
is optimally compacted. Said known installation has the disadvantage that the 
noise level and vibrational level in operation are unacceptably 
high. Consequently, said installation constitutes an 
unacceptable burden on the surroundings, whilst it is also not 
able to meet legal requirements with regard to working 
conditions. Moreover, the environmental nuisance, caused by 
noise and vibrations, is too high. The aim of the invention is, therefore, to provide an 
installation of the type described above which does not have 
these disadvantages. This is achieved because each plate is 
connected to the frame by means of an associated, spring-mounted 
massive body. The relatively large massive bodies prevent vibrations 
being transmitted to the frame. An additional advantage of said 
bodies is that a substantial machine foundation is no longer 
required since said foundation only has to take the weight of 
the installation but does not have to absorb the dynamic forces 
which are associated with the vibrating function of the 
installation. Preferably, the upper plate is connected to the 
associated upper massive body by means of an exciter, whereas 
the lower plate is connected to the associated lower massive 
body by means of a pressure cylinder.  
 The frame is so constructed that the latter has, on the 
one side, a set of anchor points for the upper massive body 
and, on the other side, a set of anchor points for the lower 
massive body, and at least the frame sections which connect the 
sets of anchor points are rigid. With this arrangement the 
frame comprises two parallel plate sections, each of which has 
a vertical section which connects two horizontal sections, 
which horizontal sections carry the anchor points. The invention will be explained in more detail below 
with the aid of the illustrative embodiment
