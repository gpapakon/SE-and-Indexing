<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an auxiliary frame (1) for a 
wheelchair (16) comprising coupling means for coupling the 

auxiliary frame (1) to the wheelchair (16), at least one steerable 
wheel (3) and drive means (11,12), wherein the coupling means are formed 

by a central elongate body (6) provided with a bearing (7) for co-action 
with the frame (17) of the wheelchair (16) and a clamping 

bracket (5) pivotally connected to the elongate body (6) and co-acting 
with the bearing (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an auxiliary frame for a 
wheelchair comprising coupling means for coupling the 
auxiliary frame to the wheelchair, at least one steerable 
wheel and drive means, wherein the coupling means are 
formed by a central elongate body provided with a bearing 
for co-action with the frame of the wheelchair and a 
clamping bracket pivotally connected to the elongate body 
and co-acting with the bearing. Known from the British patent publication GB-2124985 
is a steerable drive unit for coupling to a wheelchair. 
The drive unit comprises drive and steering means whereby 
a person sitting in the wheelchair can drive and steer 
the wheelchair using a coupled drive unit. A drawback to 
the drive unit as described in the said patent publication 
is the complex coupling construction of the drive 
unit. It requires a great deal of effort to disconnect 
the drive unit or to connect it to the wheelchair. The present invention has for its object to provide 
a simplified auxiliary frame for a wheelchair which can 
be coupled to a wheelchair by a wheelchair user in very 
simple yet stable manner and which is also very simple to 
disconnect. Despite the simple coupling operation the 
coupling connection must be operationally reliable and 
stable. The invention provides for this purpose an auxiliary 
frame with the characteristic that the coupling means 
also comprise a stationary hook-like member connected to 
the elongate body. When the wheelchair and the auxiliary 
frame have to be coupled, the wheelchair user moves the 
wheelchair partly over the elongate body. The elongate 
body herein preferably urges the front part of the wheelchair 
upward such that the front wheels are lifted free 
of the ground. The coupling position is reached in that 
the hook-like member engages round a tube of the frame of 
the wheelchair. For the coupling the clamping bracket now  
 
only has to be displaced from a non-clamping position to 
a clamping position. The wheelchair user can thus mutually 
connect the wheelchair and the auxiliary frame in very 
simple manner with one hand. When disconnecting the 
auxiliary frame and the wheelchair the clamping bracket 
must be placed in a non-clamping position whereafter the 
wheelchair can be moved away from the auxiliary frame. A preferred embodiment is characterized in that the 
coupling means also comprise locking means, which locking 
means are formed by a member pivotally connected to the 
clamping bracket and a stop connected to the elongate 
body. These easy to
