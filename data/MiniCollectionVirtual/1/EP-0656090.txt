<ABSTRACT>
A roofing batten (2) formed as a unitary moulding of plastics material has tile fixing means (4) comprising latch elements (20, 22) for engaging, in use, with the headlap portion of an associated tile in a first row of such tiles and a hook element (30) for engaging, in use, with the sidelock portion of an associated tile in a second row of such tiles overlying said first row. The battens (2) are provided with conventional coupling means (32, 33) for enabling the assembly thereof along a roof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in or relating to 
roofing battens and their use in a novel method of tiling a 
roof. Conventional roofing battens are generally provided by sawn 
strips of wood and are secured to the roof structure to enable 
a tiler to cover a roof with tiles. To this end the tiles may 
be secured by nails which are driven into the battens through 
apertures in the tiles and/or the tiles may be secured by clips 
of many diverse configurations which clips may be adapted to 
engage headlap and/or side-lock portions of the tiles. In any event, the fixing of tiles to a roof is a time- consuming 
exercise and especially where nails and clips are utilised 
causing the tiler to carry about his person a pouch for the 
nails and clips and a belt for carrying the tools necessary for 
nailing, etc. With non-conventional tiles, e.g. the plastics tiles of PCT 
W087/04479, it is proposed to use an extruded batten strip which 
is generally of "T" cross-section along its length and which 
strip is arranged to be accommodated in captive engagement by 
complementary "T" shaped channels extending widthwise across the 
underside of the tiles. In order to mount the tiles of PCT 
W087/04479 on a roof, each tile must be mounted onto a batten 
strip from one end and slid sideways along a roof into place. 
This is not a practical way in which to locate conventional 
tiles on a roof. In a further engagement as disclosed in GB-A-2222620, the tiles 
are provided with lateral slots of thin section on an underside 
thereof for engaging in use a support flange of a batten strip, 
conventional tiles, e.g. concrete roof tiles are manufactured 
in the main by passing pallets seriatim through a tile moulding 
machine whereat tile mortar is formed on the pallets as a ribbon  
 
of mortar which is thereafter cut to form discrete tiles on each 
pallet. Such pallets form the underside of the tiles which 
preclude the manufacture of the non-conventional tiles 
GB-A-2222620 with the thin section lateral slots. DE-C-1 509 135 discloses a roofing batten with integral tile fixing means which are not snap-fit and which require an adjacent tile to engage the side-lock portion of a tile. US4955170 discloses the use of folded steel sheet batten 
elements which captively engage upper end portions of tiles 
mounted on a roof; however, such an arrangement does not cater 
for securing the sidelock portions of tiles located on a roof 
and thus, in inclement weather conditions, viz. high wind loads, 
the tiles may tip up
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A roofing batten (2) comprising integral tile fixing means (4) 
provided by a first snap-fit device (20, 22) for engagement, when 

in use, with a headlap portion of a roof tile, characterised in that the tile 
fixing means also comprises a second snap-fit device (30) for 

engagement, when in use, with the side-lock portion of a 
roof tile. 
A roofing batten according to Claim 1 wherein the first 
snap-fit device comprises a hold-down clip (20, 22) overlying a 

recess (16) formed in an upper surface, in use, of the batten, 
said recess being adapted to captively receive, in use, a 

ribbed portion formed on an underside of a headlap portion 
of a tile engaged thereby. 
A roofing batten according to either one of Claims 1 and 
2 wherein the second snap-fit device comprises a hook 

element (30) extending upwardly and rearwardly of the upper 
surface, in use, of the batten, said hook element being 

adapted, in use, to latch over a grooved side-lock portion 
of a roof tile engaged thereby. 
A roofing batten according to any one of Claims 1 to 3 
wherein the batten (2) is of wedge-shape cross-section, or 

substantially so, at right angles to the length thereof, 
the arrangement being such that, in use, the small end (8) of 

the wedge shape is the upper end and faces towards the 
ridge of a roof on which it is used. 
A roofing batten according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 
formed together with the tile fixing means as a unitary 

moulding of plastics material. 
A roofing batten according to Claim 5 wherein the plastics 
material is polyethylene.  

 
A method of tiling a roof comprising the steps of: 

a) securing a plurality of roofing battens (2) to a roof 
structure said battens comprising integral tile fixing 

means (4) provided by: 

i) tile retaining means (20, 22) for engagement, in use, 
with headlap portions of associated tiles, and 
ii) hooks for engagement (30), in use, one each with 
side-lock portions of associated tiles, 
b) successively positioning tiles of a first row of 
such tiles on the roof with the headlap portions of 

each tile being retained in snap-fit engagement with 
associated tile retaining means (20, 22), 
c) successively positioning tiles of a second row of 
such tiles on the roof in overlapping relationship 

with the tiles of said first row with the headlap 
portions of each tile being retained in snap-fit 

engagement with associated tile retaining means (20, 22) and 
the side-lock portions of each tile being engaged by 

associated hooks (30), and, 
d) repeating step c) above until the tiling of the roof 
is completed.
