<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metrological apparatus.
Typically, such apparatus carries a stylus and is used
for measuring the surface of a workpiece contacted by the
stylus, for example to determine the form or shape of the
workpiece.In a known form of metrological apparatus, an arm is
movably mounted on a support structure, and carries the
stylus. The stylus is typically provided as part of a
probe which may be movable along the arm. In use, the
arm is supported over a work table on which the workpiece
is placed. The support structure may be made movable to
carry the arm over the work table. Alternatively, the
work table may comprise a turntable, in which case the
support structure is typically not movable relative to
the turntable, but the arm is movable towards or away
from the turntable.In such a prior art structure, the support structure
includes a bearing member, which acts as a datum. The
arm bears against the bearing member as it moves relative
to the support structure, and the bearing member defines 
its position. A measuring means, for example an optical
grating, will typically be mounted close to the bearing
member, for providing a measurement of the position of
the arm along the bearing member. In this configuration,
a number of factors act to limit the accuracy with which
the position of the stylus can be measured, thereby
limiting the accuracy with which the surface of the
workpiece can be measured.The bearing member, acting as a datum, theoretically
constrains the arm to move precisely in a predetermined
direction, which is typically a straight line. However,
any inaccuracies in the manufacture or mounting of the
bearing member will cause corresponding inaccuracies in
the movement of the arm, so that the positioning of the
arm cannot be more accurate than the positioning and
shape of the bearing member.Any deviations of the position of the arm from its
correct intended path will tend to increase with distance
along the arm away from the bearing member. If the arm
is intended to move in a straight line, the part of the
arm contacting the bearing member will normally have the
straightest path. In order to ensure comparability 
between different measurements of the workpiece surface,
made by contacting the workpiece with the stylus at
different positions of the arm relative to the support
structure, the workpiece should be placed in the line
where the arm follows most closely its perfect intended
path. However, this is the place where the arm contacts
the bearing member which acts as a
