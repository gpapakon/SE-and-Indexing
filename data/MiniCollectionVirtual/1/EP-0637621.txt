<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymeric
fluorescent substance for organic electroluminescence
devices (which may hereinafter be referred to as EL
devices) and the EL devices produced by using such a
substance. More particularly, the invention pertains
to a polymeric fluorescent substance which is soluble
in solvents and has strong fluorescence and the
organic EL devices with high luminous efficiency
produced by using said fluorescent substance.The inorganic electroluminescence devices
(which may hereinafter be referred to as inorganic EL
devices) using an inorganic fluorescent substance as
light emitting material have been applied to various
uses, for example, as flat light source for back-light
of liquid crystal displays and various display devices
such as flat panel displays, but in these devices a
high-voltage alternating current has been required for
driving the devices.Recently, Tang et al manufactured an organic EL
device having a double-layer structure comprising a
laminate of a light emitting layer made of an organic 
fluorescent dye and a layer of an organic charge
transport compound generally used in a photosensitive
layer for electrophotography to realize a low-voltage-drive,
high-efficiency and high-luminance organic EL
device. In view of many advantageous features of
organic EL devices as compared with inorganic EL
devices, such as low-voltage drive, high luminance and
easy luminescence of a large number of colors, various
attempts have been made and reported regarding
development and improvements of structure of the
devices, organic fluorescent dyes, organic charge
transport compounds, etc. (Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Vol.
27, L269, 1988; J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 65, 3610, 1989,
etc.).Hitherto, low-molecular weight organic
fluorescent dyes have been generally used as material
of the light emitting layer, and regarding polymeric
light emitting materials, proposals have been made in
some patents and publications such as WO9013148,
JP-A-3-244630 and Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 58, p. 1982
(1991). WO9013148 discloses an EL device using a thin
film of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) obtained by forming
a film of a soluble precursor on the electrode and
subjecting it to a heat treatment to convert the
precursor into a conjugated polymer.JP-A-3-244630 illustrates conjugated polymers
having a salient feature that they are themselves
soluble in solvents and unnecessitate heat treatment. 
In Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 58, p. 1982 (1991), are also
disclosed polymeric light emitting materials soluble in
solvents and
