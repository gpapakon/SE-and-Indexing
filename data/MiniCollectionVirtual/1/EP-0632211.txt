<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an elastic mounting (mount), intended, in particular, for supporting drive units in motor vehicles, with a supporting arm which projects laterally from the drive unit and is supported via elastomer bodies on a rigid abutment. To facilitate adjustment of the spring stiffness of the elastomer bodies and ensure a recycling capability, the invention provides for the supporting arm (1) to have an approximately cruciform cross-section with arms (4-7) which project obliquely sideways and for rubber bodies (10, 13-15) of elongate and prismatic cross-section cut from a continuous extrudate to be inserted for vertical and horizontal support between the arms (4-7) and the rubber bodies being surrounded by a housing (20) which is open towards the engine and is fastened to the abutment (25).
