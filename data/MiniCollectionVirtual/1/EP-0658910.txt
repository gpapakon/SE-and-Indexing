<ABSTRACT>
A membrane switch graphic assembly comprising 
superimposed outer and inner layers of flexible 

material is disclosed. The outer layer (1) is 
constituted by a transparent or translucent plastics 

material, and the inner layer (2) comprises paper. An 
intermediate layer (3) of clear adhesive is situated at 

the interface of the two layers. Printed material 
applied to the outer face of the paper at the interface 

with the intermediate layer is visible through the 
outer layer (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in membrane 
switch graphic assemblies of the kind comprising a 
flexible membrane which is adapted to enclose a switch 
operating member through which the switch is adapted to 
be operated by finger pressure, or other mechanical 
means. Known switch graphic assemblies of the kind set 
forth comprise plastic films usually of polyester or 
polycarbonate materials having a gloss and textured 
outer front face and an underside inner face on which 
graphics can be printed by using a screen printing 
technique. According to our invention a membrane switch 
graphic assembly comprises superimposed outer and inner 
layers of flexible material, the outer layer being 
constituted by a transparent or translucent plastics 
material, the inner layer comprising paper, with an 
intermediate layer of clear adhesive situated at the 
interface of the two layers, whereby printed material 
applied to the outer face of the paper at the interface 
with the intermediate layer is visible through the 
outer layer. Providing printed material on paper has the 
advantage that the screen printing step onto the 
plastics material can be eliminated. The outer layer may comprise a transparent or 
translucent plastics material of which the outer face 
may be of embossed configuration.  The underside of the paper layer may be secured, 
for example by adhesive, to a housing or circuit 
assembly or the like through which the switch operating 
member can be operated. Conductive ink can be printed on the underside of 
the graphic assembly, onto the paper, thereby forming 
an integral and active part of the circuit assembly. One embodiment of our invention is illustrated in 
the accompanying drawing in which the single Figure is 
a section through a membrane switch graphic assembly. The membrane switch graphic assembly comprises a 
flexible outer layer 1 of transparent or translucent 
plastics material suitably a polyester or a 
polycarbonate. An inner layer 2 comprises paper. The 
two layers are superimposed upon each other and a 
layer 3 of clear adhesive provides a permanent 
connection between the two materials at the interface 
of the two layers. Printed matter on the outer face of the paper 
layer 2 is externally visible through the clear 
adhesive 3 and the outer layer 1. The outer face of the layer 1 of plastics material 
is embossed. When the graphic assembly is installed in a 
component assembly with the panel enclosing a switch 
operating member, for example a push button switch, the 
graphic
