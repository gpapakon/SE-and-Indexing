<ABSTRACT>
Controlled release of a fragrance can be provided by 
incorporating it during emulsion polymerisation of water 

insoluble monomeric material in which it is dissolved and 
which is based primarily on alkyl (meth) acrylates alone or 

with styrenes, and by appropriate choice of the monomer 
blend and the Tg of the resultant polymer the rate of 

release of the fragrance can be selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to controlled-release 
compositions comprising an active ingredient releasably 
contained within polymeric particles. It is well known to try to control the release of an 
active ingredient from a composition by trapping the 
active ingredient within polymer particles, so that the 
active ingredient has to escape from the particles before 
it can exert its desired activity. There have been 
numerous proposals in the literature. Many of the proposals involve forming the polymeric 
particles and then absorbing the active ingredient into 
the particles. For instance in JP 58-121212A particles 
of cross linked sodium polyacrylate are formed and an 
aqueous emulsion of an active ingredient is then absorbed 
into the particles. In U.S. 4,269,959 cross linked 
polymethyl methacrylate beads are formed and active 
ingredient is absorbed into the beads. In JP 61-5001 an 
emulsion is formed of very soft polymer particles formed 
from 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate and other monomers and 
volatile active ingredient is then absorbed into the 
particles. In U.S. 4,303,642 an insecticide is absorbed 
into polymers formed from, for instance, styrene or 
certain acrylates. A problem with these absorption methods is that it 
is difficult to obtain a satisfactory combination of 
absorption and controlled release. If absorption is 
easy then release tends to be too fast. If absorption 
is difficult then release may be non-existent or, if 
absorption is only at the surface, may be of short 
duration. It is also known to incorporate the active 
ingredient during the formation of the particles. For 
instance in EP 67533A a film-forming polyacrylate,  
 
volatile solvent and particles of the active ingredient 
are sprayed to form encapsulated polymer particles 
containing the active ingredient. In U.S. 3,400,093 a 
solid active ingredient (an insecticide) is stirred into 
an emulsion of monomer (for instance methyl methacrylate, 
styrene or certain blends such as methyl 
methacrylate-ethyl acrylate) and the mixture is then 
subjected to oil-in-water emulsion polymerisation to form 
polymer particles containing the solid insecticide. 
This product is for use as a floor polish. In Journal 
Pharmaceutical Sciences volume 59 no.5, May 1970 pages 
614 to 618, Khanna et al describe that sustained release 
pharmaceutical compositions can be formed by bead 
polymerisation or by emulsion polymerisation in the 
presence of the pharmaceutically active ingredient, and 
the examples show the use of, inter alia, methyl 
methac
