<ABSTRACT>
The invention covers a hot and cold water mixer valve 
with thermostatic regulation, which comprises a valve 

body enclosing a ceramic-disc valve assembly and a 
thermosensitive bulb (30) arranged axially, centred and 

contiguos with the valve assembly, susceptible of axial 
dilatation and free from any control functions for the 

opening/closing of the valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns hot and cold water 
mixer taps for sanitary fittings, and it particularly 
relates to a ceramic-disc mixer valve embodying a 
thermostatic regulator. On the one hand, mixer valves are known which can 
be inserted into tap bodies like cartridges and which 
comprise ceramic-disc valve assemblies to control the 
delivery of hot water, cold water or mixed water 
resulting from the displacement of a displaceable disc 
on another fixed disc. The fixed and displaceable discs 
are usually provided with inlet passages for hot and 
cold water and with one outlet passage for the delivery 
of mixed water to the tap spout.  On the other hand, various types of hot and cold 
water mixer taps are known which comprise thermostatic 
regulators designed to interact with a sliding unit 
which varies the inlet openings for cold and hot water 
in order to change the mixing ratio of the two types of 
water according to the temperature required for the 
fluid delivered. In known arrangements, the 
thermosensitive unit is often designed to perform 
control functions and to operate the valve elements as 
well, thus being subject to considerable mechanical 
stress. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a mixer valve assembly integrated with a thermostatic 
regulator and advantageously interchangeable with 
normal ceramic-disc mixer valves commonly in use. In 
fact, the valve assembly proposed by this invention - 
as regards the body member which includes the ceramic 
discs and trough which water flows - keeps the same 
dimensions, the same structure, the same inlet and 
outlet passages for water and the same fixing 
modalities as common mixer valves, and additionally 
includes a raised part containing means for controlling 
the thermostatic unit. In this way, and conveniently, 
any normal mixer valve may be replaced with the 
thermostatic valve according to the present invention  
 
at any time and with no changes, with evident 
advantages as regards temperature regulation of the 
water delivered. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
thermostatic mixer valve assembly of the type described 
above, in which the thermosensitive element is free 
from any control functions and therefore it is not 
subject to any mechanical stresses, thus ensuring the 
utmost efficiency thereof. A further object of the invention is to provide a 
thermostatic valve with particularly simple and compact 
structure, having the same number of ceramic discs, 
usually two, as traditional mixer valves
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A hot and cold water mixer valve assembly with 
thermostatic regulation which comprises a valve body 

enclosing a ceramic-disc valve assembly and having the 
same structure, outer dimensions, inlet and outlet 

passages for water and fixing modalities as a normal 
mixer valve, characterized in that it comprises a 

thermosensitive bulb (30) arranged axially, centred and 
contiguous with the valve assembly, susceptible of 

axial dilatation only and free from any control 
functions for the opening/closing of the valve. 
A mixer valve with thermostatic regulation as 
claimed in claim 1, in which the valve assembly 

comprises two overlapping ceramic discs, one fixed (21) 
in the valve body and the other displaceable (22), 

resting and rotating on the fixed disc and in which the 
said discs are provided with slits (21a) for separate 

inflow of hot and cold water and with one central 
outlet hole (21b) for the passage of water towards the 

spout of the mixer tap body, the displaceable disc 
being designed to rotate for the opening/closing of the 

water inlet slits, wherein the displaceable disc (22) 
is connected to a pulling sleeve (23) rotably mounted 

in the valve body and rotably coupled to a pulling 
plate (24) which is rotably driven in the cover of the 

said body, wherein the pulling sleeve (23) defines two 
 

conduits (27, 28) coinciding with the inlet slits (21a) 
for hot and cold water provided in the said 

displaceable disc and, centrally, a chamber (25) open 
towards the central holes of the two overlapping discs 

(21, 22), such conduits (27, 28) being in communication 
with the said chamber (25) through radial openings 

(27a, 28a) at different levels, wherein a 
thermosensitive bulb (30) is located in the said 

chamber (25), axially with the said discs (21, 22) and 
is displaceable axially together with a supporting cage 

(32) having an annular portion (32') which can be 
displaced so as to face the said radial openings (27a, 

28a), the thermosensitive bulb (30) being provided with 
a stem (31) coupled to and axially interacting with a 

pulling bush (33) designed to cause rotation of the 
pulling plate (24) and, through the pulling sleeve 

(23), of the displaceable disc (22) for the 
opening/closing of the water inlet slits on the one 

hand and, on the other hand, to control the axial 
displacements of the thermostatic bulb (30) and of the 

said cage (32) through the annular portion (32') in 
order to vary the opening of the said radial holes 

according to any changes in water temperature, the said 
axial displacements of the pulling bush, of the 

thermosensitive bulb and of the cage being contrasted 
 

by springs (40, 43). 
A mixer valve with thermostatic regulation as 
claimed in claim 2, wherein the two overlapping ceramic 

discs (21, 22) are identical, wherein the pulling 
sleeve (23) is connected to the displaceable disc (22) 

on one side, and to the pulling plate (24) on the other 
side, wherein the pulling bush (33) is connected the 

pulling plate (23) in order to rotate with it though 
being displaceable axially with respect to the plate 

itself, and wherein the said pulling bush (33) is 
rotably coupled, but displaceable axially, to a 

rotating control rod (35) operated by a handle. 
A mixer valve with thermostatic regulation according 
to the previous claims, wherein a fixed case is mounted 

above the valve body, concentrically with the control 
rod (35) and with the pulling bush (33) and wherein 

means (37, 39, 40, 42) for regulating and calibrating 
the position of the thermosensitive bulb (30) are 

interposed among the said case, the said control rod 
and the said pulling bush, the said means (37) 

including a regulation handle (37) which rotates around 
the said control rod and in the said fixed case.
