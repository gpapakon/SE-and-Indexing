<CLAIMS>
Method for producing a printed circuit board (1) having at least two layers 
and having a support plate (2), a first conductor layer (7) with contact areas (pads 6) 

and a second conductor layer (19) with connecting areas (lands 16), in which 

a conductive foil (11), provided with an adhesive coating (10), is laminated onto 
the support plate (2) having the first conductor layer (7) and the contact areas 

(pads 6), at a temperature of more than 80°C, 
the adhesive coating (10) and the conductive foil (11) having holes (12) which 
correspond to the contact areas (pads 6) of the first conductor layer (7), 
the second conductor layer (19) having the connecting areas (lands 16) is 
subsequently produced from the conductive foil (11), 
the connecting areas (lands 16) of the second conductor layer (19) adjoining the 
holes (12) in the adhesive coating (10), 
after which the contact areas (pads 6) of the first conductor layer (7) can be 
electrically conductively connected to the corresponding connecting areas (lands 

16) of the second conductor layer (19) through the hole (12) of the adhesive 
coating (10), by means of soldering or by the application of a conductive paste, 
 
characterised in that 


the perforated conductive foil (11), provided with the adhesive coating (10), is 
laminated at a pressure of 50 to 150 bar onto the support plate (2) having the 

first conductor layer (7), 
the contact areas (6) of the first conductor layer (7) being curved so as to at 
least partially extend through the holes (12) of the adhesive coating (10) and of 

the conductive foil (11) in the direction of the surface of the conductive foil 
(11), 
so that - after subsequently producing the second conductor layer (19) with the 

connecting areas (16) from the conductive foil (11) - the surfaces of the contact 
areas (6) are in each case at a distance from the surface of the connecting areas 

(16) of the second conductor layer (19) which is less than the thickness of the  
 

connecting areas (16). 
Method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the adhesive coating 
(10) consists of an acrylate adhesive which can be softened by heat and which has a 

glass transition temperature T
G
 of 50 - 70°C and a thickness of 20 to 150 µm, 
preferably 35 to 

60 µm. 
Method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the contact areas 
of the first conductor layer (7) are connected to the corresponding connecting areas of 

the second conductor layer (19) by automatic soldering in a wave-soldering bath. 
Method as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that, before soldering, 
holes (22) are drilled or punched through the connecting areas and the contact areas (6) 

of the two conductor layers (7, 19), which holes (22) pass through the support plate (2). 
Method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a 
laminate consisting of paper layers impregnated with resin is used as the support plate 

(2). 
Method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the perforated 
conductive foil (11), provided with the adhesive coating (10), is laminated to the 

support plate (2) having the first conductor layer (7), under the influence of pressure of 
80 to 120 bar, at a temperature above 140°C. 
Printed circuit board (1) having at least two layers, comprising a first 
conductor layer (7) and a second conductor layer (19) which is separated therefrom by 

an adhesive coating (10), 

the first conductor layer (7) having contact areas (6) and the second conductor 
layer having connecting areas (16) corresponding thereto, and 
the contact areas (6) and the corresponding connecting areas (16) being 
interconnectable in an electrically conductive manner, 
the adhesive coating (10) having holes (12) at the points where the contact areas 
(6) can be electrically conductively connected to the corresponding connecting 

areas (16), 
 
characterised in that
 
   - the contact areas (6) of the first conductor layer (7) are curved so as to at least 

partially extend through the holes (12) in the adhesive coating (10) in the  
 

direction of the surface of the connecting areas (16) of the second conductor 
layer (19), which is less than the thickness of the connecting areas (16).
