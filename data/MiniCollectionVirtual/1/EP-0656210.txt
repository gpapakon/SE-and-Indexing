<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glutaminase 
inhibitor comprising an imidazole compound as an active 
ingredient. Specifically, it relates to a pharmaceutical 
composition inhibiting the proliferation of malignant tumors 
originated mainly in the large intestine, malignant tumors 
derived therefrom and distantly metastasized to organs such 
as the liver, and malignant tumors originated in the stomach, 
prostate gland, liver, etc., by inhibiting the enzyme 
glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2) in mitochondrial membranes of the 
tumor cells. The enzyme glutaminase in the membranes of 
mitochondria, i.e., organelles producing energy of cells, is 
known as one of the enzymes that are characteristically 
required for the proliferation of some tumor cells and 
utilized only in a trace amount in other normal cells. 
Researchers have not succeeded in developing clinically 
satisfactory anti-cancer agents that, by inhibiting this 
enzyme, selectively inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells 
and cause no damage to other cells (e.g., Medina et al.,  
 
"Miguel Angel Medina": Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, 
113, 1-15 (1992)). The number of patients with a large intestinal 
cancer (e.g., colon carcinoma, rectum carcinoma) is the 
largest next to that of patients with lung carcinoma, and the 
large intestinal cancer has a high postoperative recurrence 
rate. At present, there is no postoperative auxiliary 
chemotherapeutic agent that is effective alone. Combinations 
of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, e.g., mainly the 
antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), have been used for the 
therapy. However, effective standard therapies against the 
disease have not been established yet (see e.g., "Carcinoma 
of the Colon and Rectum", Medical View, 1989). Novel 
selective therapeutic agents against large intestinal cancers 
are being developed all over the world. However, clinically 
effective ones have not developed yet (e.g., Colon Cancer 
Cells, p.1, M. P. Moyer and G. H. Poste ed., Academic Press, 
Inc., (1990)). The following compounds are known.
