<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns nucleotide analogs, 
their method of preparation and their compositions and 
use in the treatment of viral infections. In particular, 
it concerns acyclic phosphonomethoxyalkylsubstituted, 
alkenyl and alkynyl derivatives of purine and pyrimidine 
bases. Infectious viral diseases are recognized as an 
important medical problem. Progress against infectious 
viral diseases requires the development of drugs with 
selective antiviral activity while remaining benign to 
normal cell lines. A number of antiviral agents 
currently under study, which seem to possess some 
selectivity, are nucleoside analogs. In general, these 
compounds are structural analogs of the naturally 
occurring nucleosides. Structural modification in either 
the purine or pyrimidine base nucleus and/or the 
saccharide component results in a synthetically modified 
nucleoside derivative which, when incorporated into a 
viral nucleic acid forming process, acts to disrupt 
further synthesis of viral nucleic acid. Effectiveness 
of these antiviral agents depends on selective conversion 
by viral enzymes or by host enzymes, to the corresponding 
nucleotide analog which is then converted to the  
 
triphosphate and incorporation into viral nucleic acid 
occurs. A problem with this antiviral strategy has been 
the emergence of certain viral strains whose enzymes 
poorly promote phosphorylation of the nucleoside analogs. 
To circumvent this problem, intact nucleotide analogs 
appear to be potentially quite useful as antivirals for 
incorporation into viral nucleic acid. Reist and Sturm in PCT/US 84/00737, published 
December 6, 1984, disclosed new phosphonic acid analogs 
of nucleosidephosphates which are useful as antivirals 
for incorporation into viral DNA. The structural formula 
for these compounds is shown below as 1. 
In the Reist compounds, B is a purine or 
pyrimidine base: R1 and R2 together complete a 
β-pentofuranose sugar or R1 is H and R2 is H or 
hydroxymethyl; R3 is H or OH; X is H, OH or together with 
Y is carbonyl oxygen and Y can also be H; Z1 and Z2 are H 
or alkyl. These art compounds are generally 
distinguished from the compounds of the instant invention 
by 1) the ether-oxygen link to the carbon atom attached 
to the base which is intended to preserve or mimic the 
acetal oxygen bond of a pentofuranose sugar ring; and 2) 
the phosphate modification is a phosphonoalkylene moiety. 
In contrast, the acyclic sugar analog component of the  
 
instant compounds is comprised of an all carbon atom 
backbo
