<ABSTRACT>
A sheet including at least one pleated region (13) with end-fastened folds (3). The sheet is folded in half in a direction perpendicular to that of the folds (3) and at least one of its ends (15) is sealed by fastening together the edges to give a receptacle suitable for loose goods. The receptacle may then be extended out to provide a fully or partially sealed package.

Packaging intended to contain bulk products and made of a thin sheet 
comprising disymmetrical folds (3) fixed at their extremities, the folded portion being 

folded onto itself perpendicular to the direction of the folds so as to form a bottom (8) or 
bellows bottom (6), thus allowing an opening (10) to exist whose edges (31, 32) are 

aligned or offset and able to be extended from a non-folded zone (14) forming two walls 
connected together by at least one of their borders (4, 5), wherein the folds (3) are fixed 

at their extremities via the formation of a hem (35, 46) shaped prior to folding, and by 
adding an adhesive line on a single side of the sheet by means of another temporary 

fixing of the walls (52 and 53) of each fold located opposite it and situated on a given 
side of the sheet so that the internal faces (44 and 45) of the folds adhere together and so 

that the outer faces (43 and 44) do not adhere together so as to enable said folds to be 
deployed under the effect of a traction exerted perpendicularly on the comers (9) of the 

packaging separating the temporarily fixed portions (44 and 45) of the folds and enabling 
the volume of the packaging to be increased. 
Packaging according to claim 1, wherein the non-folded zone (14), situated in 
the extension of the fold deployment direction and whose width (16) is equal to or 

different from the width (17) of the folded portion, originates from the same sheet as the 
folded portion or is mounted and is closed at its extremity opposite the folded portion so 

as to serve as a receptacle for the bulk product, whereas the folded portion (13) can be 
deployed to close the receptacle. 
Packaging according to claim 2, wherein the non-folded portion is also closed 
at its extremity forming a separation zone (20) with the folded portion so as to constitute 

a bag able to be closed via the deployment of the folded portion. 
Packaging according to claims 1 and 2, wherein the non-folded portion is 
replaced by a second folded portion (22) whose folds fixed at their extremities are kept 

along one or several lines (25) so as to prevent them from moving and create heat 
insulation via the superimposing of several sheet thicknesses. 
Packaging according to claim 4, wherein one portion of the folds of the second 
folded zone (22) are only fixed at their extremities so as to be able to be deployed before 

the entire receptacle is closed by deploying the first folded portion (28).  
 
Packaging according to claim 1, wherein the offsetting of the edges (31 and 
32) is greater than the height (37) of the hem (35) so as to enable the edge of the 

shortest wall (31) to be secured to the internal wall (33) of the bag. 
Packaging according to claim 1, wherein the same temporary method for fixing 
the folds is used in other zones of the bag and especially close to the bottom (8).
