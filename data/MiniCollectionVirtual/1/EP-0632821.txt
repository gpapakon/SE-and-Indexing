<ABSTRACT>
Colored pigments on the basis of platelet-like substrates containing TiO2, one or more suboxides of titanium and an oxide or oxides of one or more different metals and/or non metals, whereby the concentration of the titanium oxides in the coating layer is maximum in the proximity of the substrate surface and gradually decreases towards the pigment surface and the concentration of an oxide or oxides of one or more different metals and/or non metals is maximum at the pigment surface. The different metals and/or non metals are preferably Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, B, Al, Si, Zn and Fe in an amount of from 1 to 50 % by weight, relative to the amount of titanium in the pigment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a platelet-like colored 
pigment comprising titanium dioxide, one or more suboxides of 
titanium, and an oxide or oxides of one or more different 
metals and/or non metals. There is a continuously increasing demand for pigments with 
intense pearlescent color and/or metallic luster in the field 
of paints, coatings, inks, plastics, cosmetics and especially 
for exterior coatings. Therefore, the development in the 
field of pigments aims at lustrous and hiding pigments which 
can be new effect pigments or replace the metallic pigments 
such as aluminum flakes with their known disadvantages. It is 
known that coatings of TiO2-layers on platelet-like substrates 
produce the so-called pearlescent effect. For this kind of 
pigments it is possible to control the interference color by 
changing the thickness of the TiO2-layer. It is known from DE 
3433657, US 4623396 and EP 0332071 to use suboxides, e. g. 
suboxides of titanium, for the coating of platelet-like 
substrates whereby for the reduction of the TiO2 ammonia gas 
is used.  
 However, the reduction of solid particles by a reducing gas 
is not suitable for an industrial production, because the 
color of the product as a function of the degree of reduction 
is difficult to control. It is dependent on the size of the 
particles, the temperature, the gas flow and the time of 
treatment. Furthermore special facilities for dangerous or 
toxic gas are necessary. It is also known that such suboxides 
provide functional properties such as electric conductivity. JP-A-1-158077 discloses a pigment consisting of a titanium 
oxide layer containing a dark color region on a mica core and 
a color tone adjusting layer as covering layer comprising at 
least one of silicon oxide, aluminum oxide and zinc oxide or 
a composite oxide thereof. The dark color region is composed 
of a dark color metal oxide, such as titanium oxide or iron 
oxide of lower order, of titanium nitride, titanium oxide or 
carbon black. The pigment is manufactured in a first step by heating and 
reducing titanium dioxide-coated mica flakes at a temperature 
of from 500 째C to 1000 째C in a reducing gas; or by blending 
titanium dioxide-coated mica flakes with titanium metal and 
heating the resulting blend in a vacuum at a temperature of 
from 500 to 1000 째C for a long time of more than 6 hours. The 
covering layer is deposited in a second step in an aqueous 
medium by precipitating of silicon dioxide hydrate on the 
first layer containing the titanium suboxides and
