 ..*'ORAL COMPOSITIONS FOR INHIBITING PLAQUE AND CALCULUS FORMATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to oral compositions containing an anti plaque agent or an anticalculus agent."Oral composition" means a composition for topical applications to the oral10 cavity to clean and care for the teeth as well as the oral cavity surfaces. Representatives of such compositions are oral hygiene products and dentifrices such as mouthwashes or rinses, toothpaste, dental gels, tooth powder, chewing gum, lozenges and similar products. In addition to cleaning teeth to remove dental plaque, the function of oral hygiene preparations is to stop the formation of dental calculus, to prevent dental disorders such as caries,15 periodontosis and gingivitis, and also to eliminate halitosis.Dental calculus, or tartar as it is sometimes called, is a hard mineralized material which forms on teeth that consists of inorganic and organic components. The inorganic portion is largely calcium and orthophosphate arranged in a crystal lattice called 20 hydroxyapatite (HAP). The organic portion is derived mainly from microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, yeast, etc.) as well as epithelial cells, white blood cells and food debris.Formation of dental calculus occurs in two steps. In the first step, plaque is * deposited on the teeth. "Plaque" is a deposit which forms on teeth and consists of inorganic„ and organic components derived from saliva, food and bacteria which are present in the oral '*• cavity. Mostof the plaque consists of dead and living bacteria surrounded by a gel-like matrix derived from the bacteria and saliva. In the second phase, plaque undergoes calcification to form dental calculus. Initially, amorphous deposits of calcium phosphate begins to appear on and withi n the matrix of the dental plaque. As the aggregates of calcium phosphate become 

 sufficiently closely packed together, they crystallize to form HAP. The amorphous calcium phosphate, although related to hydroxyapatϊte, differs from it in crystal structure, particle morphology and stoichiometry.The presence of both the bacteria and the plaque deposits is detrimental to the health of the teeth and gums. If the bacteria and the plaque formation are not checked, they may result in infected gingival tissue, the formation of dental caries and periodontal disease.A wide variety of chemical and biological agents have been suggested in the art to retard calculus formation or to remove calculus after it is formed.
