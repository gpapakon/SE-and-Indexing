<ABSTRACT>
This method consists in particular in producing a thin layer of silicon (6) on an insulator (4), and then a mask (8, 10) comprising an opening (13) at the place provided for the channel (26) of the transistor; locally oxidising (14) the unmasked silicon; removing the mask; carrying out ion implantation (16) of the source (18) and drain (20) in the silicon, local oxidation serving as a mask for this implantation; removing the local oxidation; and producing the thin gate insulation, between the source and the drain, and then the gate.

Method for producing a MIS transistor having a channel region (26), a
source region (18) and a drain region (20) on either side of the channel

region and a gate (30a) on the channel region, separated from the source,
drain and channel regions by a thin insulator (28), said method involving the

following successive stages:

a) producing a thin silicon film (6) on an insulator (4),
b) producing on the thin silicon film (16) a mask (8, 10) having an opening
(13) at the locati
on intended for the transistor channel region (26),
c) local oxidation of the unmasked silicon so as to locally thin the silicon,
a thick oxide film (14) being formed in this way,
d) elimination of the mask (8, 10),
e) carrying out a source and drain ion implantation (16) in the silicon,
the thick oxide film serving as a mask for said implantation,
f) elimination of the thick oxide film (14),
g) producing the thin gate insulator (28) between the source region (18)
and the drain region (20),
h) producing the gate (30a) on the thin gate insulator (28), the gate (30a)
projecting onto the source region (18) and the drain region (20).
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the thin silicon film
(6) is formed by ion implantation of oxygen in a monocrystalline silicon

substrate, followed by annealing of the implanted substrate.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that between the stages of
eliminating the thick oxide layer and the production of the thin gate

insulator, the following stages are performed:

oxidation of the silicon so as to form a sacrificial oxide film (22),
implantation of ions (24) having a conductivity the reverse or identical
to that of the source and drain regions (18, 20),
elimination of the sacrificial oxide film (22).
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the thinned silicon beneath the gate has a thickness of 1 to 150 nm. 
Process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the gate (30a) is made from doped polycrystalline silicon.
