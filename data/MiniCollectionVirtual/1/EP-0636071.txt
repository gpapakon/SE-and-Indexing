<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a communications device, in particular a two-way intercom or similar system, for a vehicle (1) with a microphone (5) located inside the vehicle (1) and a loudspeaker (11 or 15) located outside the vehicle (1), an electronic circuit to which the microphone (5) and loudspeaker (11 or 15) are connected, and a switch device for the operation of the communications device. The safety of the occupants of the vehicle is increased by virtue of the fact that a second microphone (10 or 14) is located outside the vehicle (1), a second loudspeaker (6) is located inside the vehicle (1) and the second microphone (10 or 14) and the second loudspeaker (6) are connected to the electronic circuit.

<CLAIMS>
A communications device (16), in particular a two-way 
communication installation, for a vehicle (1), having a first 

microphone (5) and a first loudspeaker (6) located in the interior 
compartment (2) of the vehicle (1), and a second microphone (10 or 

14) and second loudspeaker (11 or 15) located on the outside, an 
electronic circuit (17), with which the microphones (5, 10 or 14) 

and the loudspeakers (6, 11 or 15) are connected, and with a 
switchgear (18) for operating the communications device (16), 

characterized in that the switchgear (18) has a key (21) and a 
switch (19) for activating the communications device (16), that in 

a first operating position the switchgear (18) makes a connection 
between the second microphone (10; 14) and the first loudspeaker 

(6) and switches the first microphone (5) off, and in a second 
operating position makes a connection between the first microphone 

(5) and the second loudspeaker (11 or 15) and switches the second 
microphone (10 or 14) off, wherein the switchgear (18) takes up 

the first operating position when the communications device (16) 
is activated, and wherein the switchgear (18) is switched from the 

first into the second operating position when the key (21) is 
actuated, wherein this operating position of the electronic 

switchgear (18) is maintained only as long is the key (21) is 
actuated. 
The communications device in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that the first microphone (5) and/or the first 

loudspeaker (6) ore located in the area of the driver's seat (3), 
in particular in the area of the head of the driver. 
The communications device in accordance with claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the second microphone (10 or 14) and the  

 
second loudspeaker (11, 15) are arranged in the front part of the 

vehicle (1) or in the area of a front fender (12). 
The communications device in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the second microphone (10 

or 14) and the second loudspeaker (11, 15) are combined into a 
unit (9 or 13), and are particularly enclosed in a housing (23) 

and protected against the effects of weather, road grime and 
lubricants and fuels. 
The communications device in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the first and/or second 

operating positions are indicated by a first and/or second signal 
lamp (20 or 22). 
The communications device in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the volume of the 

loudspeakers (6, 11, 15) can be adjusted. 
The communications device in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a recording device can be 

attached. 
The communications device in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the microphone (10) and 

the loudspeaker (11) are housed in a taxi sign which as a rule is 
arranged on the roof of the motor vehicle (1). 
The communications device in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the first loudspeaker (6) 

and the first microphone (5) are provided in a first unit (7), 
which can be individually manipulated, and/or that the second  

 
loudspeaker (11 or 15) and the second microphone (10 or 14) are 

provided in a second unit (9 or 13).
