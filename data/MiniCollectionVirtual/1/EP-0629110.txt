<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method of
forming a conductive pattern on a substrate or on an
insulating layer in a multilayer substrate, and more
particularly, to a method in which a complicated conductive
pattern can be formed easily and at low cost.With the miniaturization of an electronic equipment and
an electronic component, a wiring pattern on a substrate or
in a multilayer substrate has been complicated and increased
in density. As a method of forming the above described
wiring pattern, the following methods have been
conventionally employed:(1) a method of printing a conductive paste on a
substrate or on an insulating layer to form a wiring
pattern, (2) a method of forming a metal thin film
throughout on a substrate or on an insulating layer by a
thin film forming process and then, finely processing the
metal thin film by a photolithographic technique to form a
wiring pattern having a desired shape, (3) a method of
disposing a mask on a substrate or on an insulating layer
and then forming a wiring pattern by a thin film forming 
process, and (4) a method of disposing a mask on a
supporting member composed of a synthetic resin film or the
like, forming a metal thin film having a desired pattern and
then transferring the metal thin film from the supporting
member to a substrate or on an insulating layer.An ordinary circuit board is constructed by forming the
wiring pattern on a substrate using the foregoing various
methods. On the other hand, a multilayer substrate is
constructed by forming a desired wiring pattern on an
insulating layer using the foregoing various methods and
then, laminating insulating layers each having the wiring
pattern formed thereon.In a wiring pattern obtained by printing a conductive
paste and sintering the same using the method (1), the
density of a metal is low, so that sufficient current-carrying
capacity cannot be obtained. When an attempt to
ensure some current-carrying capacity is made, therefore,
the wiring pattern cannot be thinned or narrowed.
Accordingly, the method (1) is not suited to form a
complicated and high-density wiring pattern.In the respective methods (2) to (4), a wiring pattern
is formed of a metal thin film, so that sufficient current-carrying
capacity can be ensured. Therefore, the wiring
pattern can be thinned and narrowed, thereby to make it
possible to form a high-density wiring pattern. If the 
shape of the wiring pattern becomes complicated, however, it
is difficult to increase the density of the wiring pattern.
