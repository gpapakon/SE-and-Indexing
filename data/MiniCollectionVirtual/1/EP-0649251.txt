<ABSTRACT>
A video camera includes a viewfinder through which an operator may 
view an image of an object to be videoed, a rotatably supported head-carrier 

cylinder and a capstan for transporting a length of magnetic recording medium. 

This video camera also includes at least one of first and second detecting units for 
detecting change in rotation of the rotary head-carrier cylinder and for detecting 

change in rotation of the capstan, respectively, and a determining unit operable to 
determine, in reference to information supplied from at least one of the first and 

second detecting units, whether or not a video recording then taking place is in 
accordance with the will of an operator. The video camera may be provided with 

at least one of a camera wobbling detector and an eye sensor for detecting whether 
or not the operator looks through the viewfinder and, in such case, the determining 

unit makes the determination in reference to information supplied from one of the 
camera wobbling detector and the eye sensor and that from at least one of the first 

and second detecting units.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a video camera operable with
either a VHS magnetic recording tape or a 8mm magnetic recording tape and, more
particularly, to the video camera equipped with means for disabling an uncalled-for
recording in the event that the video camera continues video recording against the
will of an operator such as occurring when the operator inadvertently fails to switch
the video camera off.For the purpose of the present invention, the means for disabling an
uncalled-for recording in the event that video camera continues video recording
against the will of an operator will be referred to as a "record shutoff mechanism".Video cameras equipped with the record shutoff mechanism, i.e.,
means for disabling an uncalled-for recording in the event that the video camera
continues video recording against the will of an operator, are well known and prior
art examples of the record shutoff mechanisms are disclosed in, for example,
DE-A- 4 135 643, JP-A-2087875 and JP-A-3274969. DE-A-41 35 643 representing the closest prior art from which the invention proceeds
discloses a video camera comprising a video tape recording unit including a
rotary element, means for initiating a video recording carried out by said video tape
recording unit, change detecting means for detecting a change in rotation speed of
said rotary element, and control means connected to said change detecting means
for controlling the speed of said rotary element,
as is stated in the preamble of claim 1.The record shutoff mechanism disclosed in this document relies on the wobbling of the camera detected with a mercury switch.The record shutoff mechanism disclosed in JP-A-2087875 comprises a detecting
means for detecting a change of a portion or the whole of the viewed image of an
object having captured, a determining means operable in response to information
provided by the detecting means to determine whether or not the viewed image
has actually changed within the framework of a viewfinder screen and then to
provide an output only when it has determined the viewed image having been
changed, and a disabling means operable in response to the output from the
determining means to disable a video recording operation of the video camera.The record shutoff mechanism disclosed in JP-A-3 274969 includes either one of
a photoelectric sensor or 
a touch-sensor installed at an eyepiece area of the viewfinder. In one embodiment
where the photoelectric sensor is employed, the photoelectric sensor is utilized to
determine whether or
