<ABSTRACT>
In the art of unwinding webs from an unwind stand (10) in which a fresh web (20) is prepared with a paste strip and is lapped spliced to a progressing expiring web (11), and the expiring web (11) is then cut upstream of the splice (30) to form a tail (33), the position of the tail (33) is predicted or detected, and the movement thereof to a taping station causes a tape support roll (50) to apply tape (52) to the tail. A strip of one-sided adhesive tape (52) is applied to the tail (33) such that part of the adhesive strip (52) covers the tail (33) and part of the strip (52) engages the underlying web (20) so that the tail (33) becomes firmly taped down to the web (20) thereby permitting the web (20) to be run in either direction through processes such as converting or coating processes. Embodiments of tape tail detectors (36) are disclosed and embodiments of hold-down tape transfer mechanisms are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of dispensing moving webs of paper,
plastic and the like, in which the leading end of a fresh roll of web material has
been spliced onto an expiring roll of such web material, and a portion of the
web issuing from the expiring roll has been severed from the remaining portion
of the roll.Automatic web splicing apparatus for web unwind systems is known for
forming butt splices or overlapping splices. The most common splicing
apparatus forms an overlapping splice. The web from the expiring roll,
following the splice, is severed so that a short tail of material, formerly part of
the expiring web, follows the splice as it progresses through subsequent
coating and/or converting stages.The actual length of the tail, following cutting from the expiring roll, will
vary in accordance with the reaction time of the knife, web speed, the
particular equipment being used, and in the case of manual or semi-automatic
operation, the skill of the operator. Thus, in certain manual or semi-automatic
splice control systems, a 61 cm (two foot) tail at 152.4m (500 feet) per minute
could become a 122cm (four foot) tail at 304.8m (1,000 feet) per minute web
speed.Other systems may be programmed so that the expiring web can always
be cut at about the same length following the splice over a wide range of
variables which include line speed and unwind roll diameters.Apparatus and systems of the foregoing type are disclosed in US-A-3,253,795.
Apparatus based on the concepts of the latter US-A, i.e. apparatus
which forms a tail of a definite length, is disclosed in the reprint of an article
from Paper, Film and Foil Converter, November 1987, by R. Duane Smith,
entitled "Continuous Splicing Techniques", pages 1-6. Both documents cited above
represent the most relevant prior art.While such systems are capable of stabilizing the length of the free tail,
it is not usually practical in such systems to provide an overlap splice which
has no tail. Even a short loose tail portion can flap around as the web is curved
around rolls, and can interfere with the proper movement of the splice through 
downstream machinery. An unsecured trailing edge or tail can disrupt
downstream processes, such as coating processes. Further, in cases where
the web is rewound, it may not be directly used by other processes, and an
unsecured tail in a subsequent process may lead rather than follow, thereby
disrupting the process or even tearing or breaking the web.In systems which form overlapping splices, there is a need for an
appar

The method of unwinding a web in which a fresh web (20) is spliced
onto a moving expiring web (11) and a trailing tail (33) of a cut expiring web

laps a portion of the fresh web after splicing and taping such tail (33) to the
fresh web (20) without interrupting the movement of such web, characterised

by:

causing a detectable marker (25, 125) to be placed on at least one of
said webs (20) in a predetermined position relative to the end (34) of said tail

(33), detecting (36) said marker and providing an electrical signal representing
the position of the end of said tail, and applying a strip of adhesive tape (52)

to said tail end (34) and to the underlying web (20) for taping down said tail to
the fresh web (20).
The method according to claim 1, further characterised by supporting
said strip of adhesive tape (52) on the surface of a tape support roll (50) prior

to said detecting step, and, in response to said electric signal, moving said tape
support roll (50) with said strip of tape applied thereto relative to said fresh

web (20) so that said tape (52) engages said tail (33) at said end (34) thereof.
The method according to claim 2 in which said tape support roll (50) is
a vacuum roll, the method including supporting said strip of adhesive tape (52)

by means of a vacuum applied thereto via the vacuum roll.
The method according to claim 2 or 3, further characterized by placing
said marker (25) at the end (34) of said tail.
The method according to claim 4, characterized by applying a marker
(25) comprising a strip of reflective tape to said fresh web (20) so that,

following splicing of said webs (11, 20) an exposed portion (25A) of said
reflective tape extends along said fresh web (20) from beneath the cut end (34)
