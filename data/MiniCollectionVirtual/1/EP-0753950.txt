<ABSTRACT>
A network (10) includes an adaptive repeater (12) that can 
service data devices (18,20,22,26,28,30) at 

different data rates. The data 
devices are coupled to ports (34) of the adaptive repeater and 

operate at a first rate in a first domain (14). The data 
devices are also coupled to other ports of the adaptive 

repeater and operate at a second rate in a second domain (16). 
Repeaters (24,32) and bridges (40,42) may 

also be coupled to the adaptive 
repeater.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of networking
data devices, and more particularly to an adaptive
repeater system.Ethernet is a common communications standard used
in local area networks (LANs) to share information
among computers, printers, modems, and other data
devices. A traditional Ethernet network operates at 
transmission rates of ten megabits per second (Mbps),
but there is currently a move in the networking
industry towards higher capacity 100-Mbps networks.
This transition towards higher transmission rates
often results in hybrid systems that service both 10-Mbps
and 100-Mbps data devices.A repeater in a network receives data from a data
device and re-transmits the data to the remaining data
devices attached to the repeater. For example, a 10-Mbps
repeater with six ports may receive a data
message on one of its ports and repeat or re-transmit
the message to the remaining five ports. Without
bridging devices, each data device coupled to the
repeater normally operates at 10-Mbps. To service
100-Mbps data devices, the network could add an
additional 100-Mbps repeater.As networks evolve with a mix of data devices
operating at different data rates, repeater couplings
and hardware must also be modified. Therefore, a need has arisen for a repeater that can
service data devices at different data rates.Electronic Design, vol. 43, no. 6, 20 March 1995 pp
155-160 discloses such a repeater having a single repeater
module receiving and transmitting data to multi-rate
interface circuits/transceivers.According to the present invention, a repeater coupled
to the data devices includes a first repeater module
operable to receive first data from a first data device
operating at a first rate and to communicate the first data
to the remaining data devices operating at the first rate;
a second repeater module operable to receive second data
from a second data device operating at a second rate and to
communicate the second data to the remaining data devices
operating at the second rate; and a plurality of interface
circuits coupled to the data devices that can transmit and
receive data at different rates, each of the interface
circuits being coupled to the two repeater modules
operating at different data rates.The present invention includes a method for exchanging
data among a plurality of data devices coupled to a
repeater including the steps of communicating data from a transmitting
data device to the repeater at a data rate; communicating
the data, in response to the data rate, to one of a first
repeater
