<ABSTRACT>
A multi-beam electron gun (60) for a color cathode ray tube (CRT) includes a plurality of vertically spaced, horizontal inline beams, where each inline array of beams provides the three primary colors and adjacent inline beam arrays simultaneously trace adjacent horizontal scan lines (72a, 72b), where each inline array of beams provides three primary colors and adjacent inline beam arrays simultaneously trace adjacent horizontal scan lines (83a, 83b) on the color CRT's display screen (61). Each inline array of beams is modulated in accordance with that portion of the video image which they form allowing adjacent, vertically spaced inline arrays to write different video image information on the screen in simultaneously forming adjacent portions of the color video image. Simultaneously providing color video image information on more than one horizontal scan line allows for a reduction in horizontal scan frequency and associated magnetic deflection yoke operating criteria, and also increases beam dwell time on the screen's phosphor elements allowing for a reduction in individual beam current without sacrificing video image brightness while improving video image resolution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to multi-beam
electron guns such as used in color cathode ray tubes (CRTs)
and is particularly directed to an electron gun having
grouped electron beams for simultaneously providing a portion
of the color video image on the CRT's screen on more
than one horizontal scan line.The clear path for future color CRT development
is in the direction of high definition television (HDTV)
displays. This is true whether operating in accordance with
the NTSC standard or the PAL format. Regardless of the
color television system, a HDTV display requires a higher
frequency magnetic deflection yoke and high video image
resolution and brightness. Increased display performance
does not come without a price.Increasing the scan frequency of the CRT's magnetic
deflection yoke requires higher deflection input power
to the yoke as well as a more expensive yoke assembly. To
provide acceptable brightness and resolution in a large 16:9
color CRT, higher beam current and improved video image
resolution are required. These enhancements typically require
a larger CRT envelope neck size to accommodate a larger
electron gun. Increasing the size of the CRT envelope is
contrary to current trends which seek to reduce the non-display
screen portions of the CRT. One approach to providing
acceptable image brightness involving the use of higher beam
currents employs a dispenser cathode which affords high
electron emission densities. However, the use of a dispenser
cathode substantially increases the cost of the
cathode, i.e., on the order of 50 times more than that of a
conventional oxide cathode, to the point where these exotic
cathodes are at present not commercially viable for use in a
CRT. While some of the aforementioned approaches have been
adopted in high definition television (HDTV) CRT's, the increased 
cost and complexity of the resulting CRT reduces its
commercial competitiveness relative to other HDTV display
technologies such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs), plasma
display panels (PDPs), etc.Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown an isometric
view partially in phantom of a typical prior art multi-beam
electron gun 10 for use in a color CRT. A sectional view of
the electron gun 10 shown in FIG. 1 taken along site line 2-2
therein is shown in FIG. 2. Electron gun 10 includes a
plurality of spaced, inline cathodes 12, 14 and 16 which
each provide respective pluralities of energetic electrons
in the general direction of a G1 control grid 18 having a
plurality of spaced, inline apertures 18a, 18b and
