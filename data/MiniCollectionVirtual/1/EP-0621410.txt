<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hollow composite member for the acceptance of torques and/or tensile, compressive or bending forces. In this member, inner supporting means which accept pressure in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis ensure that a uniform tensile prestress prevails in the circumferential direction at the circumference of an outer layer of material, over essentially the entire axial length. The supporting means are formed by a plurality of annular or sleeve-shaped bodies resting against the outer layer over parts of its circumference, particularly in combination with shaped bodies situated inbetween.

A composite hollow body for the absorption of torques and/or tensile, compressive 
or bending forces, wherein a tensile prestress, which is uniform over the periphery 

in each case, prevails in the peripheral direction substantially over the entire axial 
length in an elastically expanded outer material layer (21) due to plastically expanded 

inner supporting means which after the release of the expansion pressure are pressure-absorbing 
in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, and a plurality of ring 

or sleeve bodies (22, 23, 24), which are seated against the outer layer (21) over parts 
of the periphery, form the supporting means in combination with shaped bodies (25, 

26, 27, 28) situated therebetween. 
A composite hollow body for the adsorption of torques and/or tensile, compressive 
or bending forces, wherein a tensile prestress, which is uniform over the periphery 

in each case, prevails in the peripheral direction substantially over the entire axial 
length in an elastically expanded outer material layer due to inner supporting means 

which are pressure-absorbing in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, one 
or more ring or sleeve bodies (12), which are situated at a distance from the outer 

layer (11) with the interposition of mutually supporting clamping bodies (13, 14), 
form the supporting means, and the clamping bodies secure the elastically prestressed 

outer material layer by a self-locking action in a position in which they are wedged 
against each other. 
A composite hollow body according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the ring or 
sleeve bodies forming the supporting means (12, 22, 23, 24) consist of a material 

which is plastically expanded in situ and which has a lower limit of elasticity than the 
outer layer (11, 21). 
A composite hollow body according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
intermediate bases (3, 4) are provided for additional support, and are inserted or  

 
integrally formed in the supporting means comprising the material with the lower 

limit of elasticity. 
A composite hollow body according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised by its 
construction as a crankshaft, gear shaft or camshaft. 
A composite hollow body according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised by its 
construction as a connecting rod.
