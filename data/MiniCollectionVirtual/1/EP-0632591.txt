<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an integrated circuit, comprising an output stage (10) 
with at least two respective output transistors (14a,14b), 

respective main current channels of which 
are connected in parallel between a first supply terminal (Gnd) 

and the output. A control 
circuit (15) ensures that, in response to a variation in an input 

signal on the input, the 
charging of respective control electrodes of the at least two 

respective output transistors (14a,14b) 
commences with a delay relative to one another. The peck value of the time derivative 

of a current output together by the at least two output transistors 
(14a,14b) is thus limited. After 

the start of charging, a speed of charging of the control electrode of at least one of the 
two respective output transistors (14a,14b) is reduced. The peak 

value of the time derivative of 
the current applied to the output by the at least one of the at least 

two output transistors (14a,14b) is thus reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an integrated circuit, comprising 
an output stage comprising at least two output transistors 
whose main current channels are connected parallel to one another between a supply 
terminal and an output of the output stage, and a control circuit which is arranged to start, in response to a variation in an input 
signal on an input, a charging of respective control electrodes of the output transistors with a delay relative to one another in order to limit the time derivative of a current drawn by the output transistors together.  An integrated circuit of this kind is known from United States Patent 
Specification No. 4,789,796 (PHQ 85.025). During use of such an integrated circuit, the output is usually capacitively 
loaded. When the output voltage of the circuit changes from high to low, therefore, a 
capacitance must be discharged. Discharging is realised by way of a current through the 
output via the main current channels of the output transistors to the supply leads of the 
circuit. The supply leads act as an inductance, so that a variation in the current causes 
an inductive voltage across the supply leads which is proportional to the time derivative 
of the current. Due to the inductive voltage across the supply leads, the power supply 
terminals, such as ground outside the envelope of the integrated circuit and ground 
within the integrated circuit, no longer carry the same potential. This disturbs the 
operation of the circuit. This disturbance is reduced by the known circuit, in that the peak value of 
the time derivative of the current is reduced, subject to the secondary condition that the 
capacitance must have been discharged within a specified period of time. Mutually 
delayed starting of the charging of the control electrodes ensures that the control 
electrodes of the output transistors do not reach their maximum voltage level 
simultaneously. Therefore, the instant at which the increase of the current through the 
various output transistors is maximum differs. As a result, the peak value of the time 
derivative of the current through the output is smaller than if the current in the at least  
 
two output transistors were to increase simultaneously. As the number of output transistors is larger, in principle an increasingly 
lower peak value can thus be realised in the derivative of the current. However. this 
requires a complex circuit in which notably the winng occupies a large surface area on 
the integrated circuit. United States Patent Specification No.
