<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is the characterization and purification of DNA encoding a numerous polypeptides useful for the stimulation of glial cell (particularly, Schwann cell) mitogenesis and treatment of glial cell tumors. Also disclosed are DNA sequences encoding novel polypeptides which may have use in stimulating glial cell mitogenesis and treating glial cell tumors. Methods for the synthesis, purification and testing of both known and novel polypeptides for their use as both therapeutic and diagnostic aids in the treatment of diseases involving glial cells are also provided. Methods are also provided for the use of these polypeptides for the preparation of antibody probes useful for both diagnostic and therapeutic use in diseases involving glial cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polypeptides found in
vertebrate species, which polypeptides are mitogenic
growth factors for glial cells, including Schwann cells.
The invention is also concerned with processes capable of
producing such factors, and the therapeutic application
of such factors.The glial cells of vertebrates constitute the
specialized connective tissue of the central and
peripheral nervous systems. Important glial cells
include Schwann cells which provide metabolic support for
neurons and which provide myelin sheathing around the
axons of certain peripheral neurons, thereby forming
individual nerve fibers. Schwann cells support neurons
and provide a sheath effect by forming concentric layers
of membrane around adjacent neural axons, twisting as
they develop around the axons. These myelin sheaths are
a susceptible element of many nerve fibers, and damage to
Schwann cells, or failure in growth and development, can
be associated with significant demyelination or nerve
degeneration characteristic of a number of peripheral
nervous system diseases and disorders. In the
development of the nervous system, it has become apparent
that cells require various factors to regulate their
division and growth, and various such factors have been
identified in recent years, including some found to have
an effect on Schwann cell division or development. Thus, Brockes et al., inter alia, in J.
Neuroscience, 4 (1984) 75-83 describe a protein growth
factor present in extracts from bovine brain and
pituitary tissue, which was named Glial Growth Factor
(GGF). This factor stimulated cultured rat Schwann cells
to divide against a background medium containing ten
percent fetal calf serum. The factor was also described
as having a molecular weight of 31,000 Daltons and as
readily dimerizing. In Meth. Enz., 147 (1987), 217-225,
Brockes describes a Schwann cell-based assay for GGF.Brockes et al., supra, also describes a method of
purification of GGF to apparent homogeneity. In brief,
one large-scale purification method described involves
extraction of the lyophilized bovine anterior lobes and
chromatography of material obtained thereby using NaCl
gradient elution from CM cellulose. Gel filtration is
then carried out with an Ultrogel column, followed by
elution from a phosphocellulose column, and finally,
small-scale SDS gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, the
CM-cellulose material was applied directly to a
phosphocellulose column, fractions from the column were
pooled and purified by preparative native gel
electrophoresis,
