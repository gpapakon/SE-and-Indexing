<ABSTRACT>
A solvent composition containing at least one of an 
alkyl α-alkoxyisobutyrate, an alkyl β-alkoxyisobutyrate, and 

an alkyl α-hydroxyisobutyrate as an active component is 
disclosed. The solvent composition is of low toxicity and 

harmless to humans, has an extremely high dissolving power 
for high polymers, fats and oils, fluxes, liquid crystals, 

etc., produces no environment destructive substance, gives 
off no offensive odor, and has a relatively high boiling 

point indicative of safety and ease in handling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a composition as a
solvent, and more particularly to a composition suitable for
use as a solvent or an assistant in paints and varnishes,
coatings, adhesives, printing inks, cleaning agents,
agricultural chemicals, and cosmetics.Solvents have played an important role in the
development of the chemical industry. In particular, the
importance of solvents in the fields of coating compositions,
adhesives and printing inks has been ever increasing, with
the recent remarkable development in the plastics industry.
Coating compositions, adhesives, printing inks, etc. are
generally used in the form of a solution in a solvent for
assuring ease in handling on use, and for uniformly and
intimately applying a high polymer base to a substrate. To
this effect, it is very important for the solvent to have
moderate volatility, while retaining sufficient dissolving
power for the high polymer base and uniform coating
properties, as well as ease in handling. In other words, the
quality of coating compositions, adhesives, and printing inks
largely depends on the choice of solvent.Glycol ether type cellosolves, especially Cellosolve
acetate (ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate), have been 
used for their excellent properties as solvents for cellulose
resins, epoxy resins, acrylic resins, vinyl resins (e.g.,
vinyl acetate resins and vinyl chloride resins), alkyd
resins, and polyester resins which are commonly used in the
fields of coating compositions, adhesives and printing inks.
In recent years, however, demand for safety of chemical
substances has been increasing from the standpoint of
environmental pollution. In this regard, use of Cellosolve
acetate is strictly limited because of its toxicity, and the
Japanese Industrial Safety and Health Law laid down criteria
for controlling the working environment concentration
thereof.Intensive studies have therefore been directed to
development of a solvent which can be a satisfactory
substitute for Cellosolve acetate in terms of dissolving
power, and yet gives rise to no safety problem. For example,
ethyl lactate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate,
methoxypropanol, and ethyl β-ethoxypropionate have been
studied as promising alternatives. However, they are not
always satisfactory in dissolving power, safety, smell, and
ease in handling. Of these alternative solvents, ethyl
lactate, which is permitted as a food additive, seems the
most preferred from the standpoint of safety, but it is not
deemed to have sufficient dissolving power for
