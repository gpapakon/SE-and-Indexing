<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to macrocyclic immunomodulators related to rapamycin 
their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and a method for using 
them for inducing immunosuppression, and in the treatment of transplantation rejection, 
host vs. graft disease, autoimmune diseases, diseases of inflammation, solid tumors, 
fungal infections, and hyperproliferative vascular disorders. Rapamycin is a macrocyclic triene antibiotic produced by Streptomyces 
hygroscopicus, which was found to have antifungal activity, particularly against 
Candida albicans, both invitro and invivo [C. Vezina et al., J. Antibiot. 28, 721 
(1975); S.N. Sehgal et al., J. Antibiot. 28, 727 (1975); H. A. Baker et al., J. Antibiot. 
31, 539 (1978); U.S. Patent 3,929,992; and U.S. Patent 3,993,749]. Rapamycin alone (U.S. Patent 4,885,171) or in combination with picibanil 
(U.S. Patent 4,401,653) has been shown to have antitumor activity. R. Martel et al. 
[Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 55, 48 (1977)] disclosed that rapamycin is effective in 
the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model, a model for multiple sclerosis; in the 
adjuvant arthritis model, a model for rheumatoid arthritis; and effectively inhibited the 
formation of IgE-like antibodies. The immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin have been disclosed in FASEB 3, 
3411 (1989) and its utility in preventing transplantation rejection shown in U.S. Patent 
5,100,899. Cyclosporin A and FK-506, other macrocyclic molecules, also have been 
shown to be effective as immunosuppressive agents, therefore useful in preventing 
transplant rejection [FASEB 3, 3411 (1989); FASEB 3, 5256 (1989); and R. Y. 
Calne et al., Lancet 1183 (1978)]. Rapamycin has also been shown to be useful in preventing or treating systemic 
lupus erythematosus [U.S. Patent 5,078,999], pulmonary inflammation [U.S. Patent 
5,080,899], insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [Fifth Int. Conf. Inflamm. Res. Assoc. 
121 (Abstract), (1990) and European Patent Application 507,555 Al], and smooth 
muscle cell proliferation and intimal thickening following vascular injury [Morris, R. J. 
Heart Lung Transplant 11 (pt. 2): 197 (1992)]. Mono- and diacylated derivatives of rapamycin (esterified at the 28 and 43 
positions) have been shown to be useful as antifungal agents (U.S. Patent 4,316,885) 
and used to make water soluble prodrugs of rapamycin (U.S. Patent 4,650,803). 
Recently, the numbering convention for rapamycin has been changed; therefore 
according to Chemical Abstracts nomenclature, the esters
