<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high efficiency wavelength up-conversion
transparent glass ceramic composition containing rare earth ions, which can
be applied for example to short wavelength solid lasers, full color displays and
infrared light detecting sensors, and a process for the production thereof.Of late, wavelength up-conversion materials utilizing the electronic
transition between a plurality of energy levels of rare earth ions have been
studied with keen interest because they can be applied in various fields such
as blue or green solid lasers, full color displays and infrared light detecting
sensors. As transparent wavelengths up-conversion materials with a relatively
high conversion efficiency, fluoride single crystals and glasses have
hitherto been known. However, it Is Impossible to produce a fluoride single
crystal having an optical homogeneity and practical large size on a commercial
scale and in an economical manner, since although the fluoride single crystal
is excellent in conversion efficiency, mechanical strength and chemical stability,
it is difficult to grow a high quality one. On the other hand,
since fluoride glass In the form of a fiber Is capable of effectively sealing
an excitation light in a fiber core, a visible light fiber laser having
the highest infrared conversion efficiency has been obtained at the present time.
However, fluoride glass is inferior to the fluoride single crystal in thermal,
mechanical and chemical stability and has problems in durability and reliability,
for example. Thus, fluoride glass tends to deteriorate by erosion
with water and when subjected to irradiation bya laser beam of large
power, it is very prone to be damaged. For the preparation of a fluoride
glass fiber, furthermore, precise control of the preparation conditions such
as temperature and atmosphere, is essential thus resulting in increase of
production cost.On the other hand, as a glass having a very high stability is known a composition, 
typical of optical glasses, comprising, as a predominant component,
oxides. Ordinary optical glasses containing the so-called glass-forming materials
having very high chemical bonding strength, such as SiO2, GeO2,
AlO1.5, BO1.5, PO2.6, exhibit high viscosity and are much more superior
in moldability, water resistance, and mechanical strength, than fluoride
glasses containing ionic bonding compounds. In oxide glasses, however, the
emission efficiency from a number of rare earth ion levels is significantly
lower than that of fluorides, and oxide glasses are

comprising preparing an oxide-fluoride glass containing rare earth ions

by a conventional melting method, subjecting the glass to a heat treatment at a
temperature higher than the glass transition temperature and thereby precipitating

preferentially fluoride fine crystals having sizes smaller than the wavelength of light containing a large amount of
rare earth ions.
A process
as claimed in Claim 2, wherein glass forming materials are mixed, charged

to a platinum crucible, solubilized in the air at a temperature of about 1000
°C, cast in a mold of carbon and charged to an annealing furnace to remove the

strain and the thus resulting transparent glass is further heat treated for
several hours at a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature,

at which no devitrification occurs, whereby the emission efficiency of the rare
earth elements can be increased without diminishing the transparency. 
Use of a ceramic composition as claimed in Claim 1 in the manufacture of a
short wavelength solid laser, a full color display or an infrared light detecting

sensor.
