<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a filling system for filling containers (2) with a liquid product by means of a filling element (1), there is provided on the latter an electric probe (10), which determines the filling level and has a first probe section (11), which forms the lower probe tip and a first electrode (E1), as well as a second probe section (13), which is arranged above the first probe section and forms a second electrode (E2), and a probe section (12), which is designed as an insulator and is situated between the first and second probe sections. A third electrode (E3) is formed on the filling element in the path of the liquid. The electrodes are connected to an evaluation and control electronic unit (15) in such a way that the probe has a first, high-resistance state before the first and second electrodes are covered by the liquid product, has a second, low-resistance state when the first electrode is covered by the liquid product, and has a third, likewise low-resistance state when the second electrode is covered.

A filling system for decanting a liquid product into bottles (2), cans or similar 
containers with at least one filling means (1), providing at least one fluid valve 

(5) controlling the supply of the liquid product during a filling phase and 
disposed in the fluid duct and at least one probe (10) protruding the underside 

of the filling means with a given length and reaching into the container 
(2), at least during the filling phase, the probe (10) providing a lower first 

probe section (11) forming the probe tip as well as a first electrode (E1), and 
a second probe section (13) situated above and in the direction of the axis 

(FA) and forming a second electrode (E2) and is separated from the first 
probe section (11) by a third probe section (12) configured as an insulator, 

and with analysing- and control electronics (15) with a measuring- or signal 
entrance providing at least two connections, said electronics being placed in 

parallel with an electrode segment formed between the first and the second 
electrode (E1, E2) and giving a signal actuating the termination of the supply 

of the product when, at a response level in the container, the electrode segment 
between the first and the second electrode (E1, E2) is bridged by the 

liquid product and the probe (10) has changed from a primary condition of 
high resistance to a second condition of low resistance determined by the 

electric resistance of the liquid product between the first and the second 
electrode (E1, E2), characterised in that at least one third electrode (E3) is 

provided on the filling means (1), said electrode (E3) being disposed in the 
fluid duct of the liquid product and, with the second electrode (E2), at a joint 

connection of the analysing- and control electronics (15); by this an electrode 
segment formed by the third electrode (E3) and the first electrode (E1) is 

arranged in parallel with the electrode segment formed by the second 
electrode (E2) and first electrode (E1), and, when the first electrode (E1) is 

covered by the liquid product at a temporary filling level before reaching the 
response filling level, the probe (10) has a third condition of low resistance 

determined by the electric resistance of the liquid product between the third 
and the first electrode (E3, E1) corresponding to the temporary filling level  

 
and different from the first and second condition; the analysing- and control 

electronics (15) provide a measuring- or analysing circuit (16) recording the 
different probe resistances corresponding to the temporary filling level and 

response level and actuating a control signal corresponding to the temporary 
filling level as well as a control sig
nal corresponding to the response level. 
Filling system according to claim 1, characterised in that the parallel arrangement 
of the electrode segments are a component of a voltage divider arrangement 

loaded with measuring voltage supplying at its exit an output signal 
(U1, U2, U3) different for each condition of the probe (10) regarding 

voltage and amplitude. 
Filling system according to claim 2, characterised in that the measuring voltage 
is a direct voltage. 
Filling system according to claims 1 or 3, characterised in that the measuring 
voltage is an alternating or impulse voltage. 
Filling system according to claims 2 - 4, characterised in that the parallel 
arrangement of the electrode segments is preferably connected with the 

connections of the voltage source (14) supplying the measured voltage via 
at least one series impedance (15), and the measuring- and analysing circuit 

(16) is arranged in parallel with the electrode segments with two connections 
forming a measuring entrance. 
Filling system according to claims 1 - 6, characterised in that the second and 
third electrode (E2, E3 ) are connected with the earth connection of the system 

also forming a connection of the analysing- and control electronics 
(15).  

 
Filling system according to the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
voltage divider arrangement providing the electrode segments is configured 

that way that a first output voltage (U1) is applied during the first condition of 
high resistance, after reaching the temporary filling level (L1) a second output 

voltage (U2) lower than the first one is applied and, after reaching the response 
level (L2) a third output voltage (U3) lower than the second one is 

applied. 
Filling system according to claims 1 - 7, characterised in that, in the case of 
several filling means, one system of the analysing- and measuring electronics 

is provided for each filling means (1) and for a group of filling means.
