<ABSTRACT>
A positive temperature coefficient thermistor formed of a 
principal ingredient comprising barium titanate, lead titanate 

and calcium titanate, and rare earth elements, being particularly 
characterized by using calcium titanate as a raw material and 

having the particle diameter of said calcium titanate among raw 
material powders made smaller than that of other raw materials. 

The positive temperature coefficient thermistor formed by the 
present invention has improved durability in a reducing 

atmosphere due an increased density of the crystal structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermistor, resistance of 
which is changed sharply at a specified temperature, and 
particularly relates to a positive temperature coefficient 
thermistor for use in a reducing gas atmosphere and its 
fabrication method. It has been widely known that a ceramic composite prepared 
by adding a very small amount of rare earth elements such as Y, 
La or Ce or transition metals such as Nb or Ta to barium titanate 
or a solid solution containing barium titanate, lead titanate and 
calcium titanate has a semiconductive property and shows positive 
temperature coefficient (shortened to PTC) characteristics 
resistance at a temperature near its Curie point. Prior art ceramic composites have been used in a great 
variety of applications such as overcurrent protection devices, 
temperature control devices, motor starting devices, and heater 
temperature control devices utilizing PTC characteristics. As 
applications for these composites expand, requirements for their 
electrical characteristics have proliferated. Where ceramic 
composites are used as heating elements for hot air type heaters, 
heating start temperatures, usually referred to as switching 
temperature, is required to be high, and a thermistor made of a 
material of barium lead titanate system, which is prepared by 
substituting a part of the barium site of barium titanate with 
lead, and having a switching temperature of 200°C to 300°C is  
 
usually employed. For example, with a hot air type heating 
system, air flow generated by an air blower located in the back 
hits a heated PTC thermistor, the temperature of the PTC 
thermistor having reached a constant temperature level by self-heating, 
is warmed and blown out of a warm air vent located in 
the front. In the prior art, PTC thermistors have been manufactured 
according to the following method: 
(1) Raw materials are weighed and blended, for example, by 
means of a ball mill or a dispersion mill; (2) After being dehydrated and dried, for example, in a 
filter press or a drum dryer, the mixed powder is calcined; (3) The calcined powder is ground, for example, in a ball 
mill; (4) A binder is added to the ground powder to make a 
slurry, and the slurry is granulated, for example, in a spray 
dryer, and then molded to required shapes; and (5) The molded shapes are fired in air at a temperature 
ranging from 1300°C to 1400°C. Electrodes are then attached to the obtained sintered 
shapes. Raw materials corresponding to the principal ingredients to 
be blended have
