<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for cutting a paper web (9) in a twin wire former (1) is described, said web being formed between two forming fabrics (4, 5) while wrapping a section of a forming roll (3), and the web cutting being carried out with the aid of jet cutters (10, 11) discharging jets of pressure medium so that a paper web of final width is obtained and, when applicable, a tail in the web. According to the invention the jet cutters (10, 11) are arranged at the forming roll (3) so that the web cutting is carried out in the web at a point where the recently formed paper web (9) and the forming fabrics (4, 5) together wrap said section of the forming roll (3) in a sandwich structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of cutting a 
paper web in a paper machine having a twin wire former of 
the type where the web is formed between two forming 
fabrics while wrapping a section of a forming roll, said 
web cutting being carried out with the aid of at least 
one jet of pressure medium so that a paper web of final 
predetermined width is obtained and with the aid of a jet 
of pressure medium so that a tail is obtained, when 
applicable. The invention also relates to a device for cutting a 
paper web in a paper machine comprising a twin wire 
former including a forming roll and two forming fabrics 
arranged to wrap a section of the forming roll together 
with a recently formed paper web enclosed therebetween, 
said device comprising a first jet cutter arranged to cut 
the web so that a paper web of final predetermined width 
is obtained and a second jet cutter arranged to cut the 
web so that a tail is obtained, when applicable. Web cutting in the form of tail and/or edge cutting at 
the end of the forming fabric of a former is known, for 
instance, through US-A-1,279,756, US-A-2,709,398, 
US-A-2,857,822 and US-A-4,560,438. In a twin wire former the paper web is trimmed and/or cut 
to a tail while being supported by one of the forming 
fabrics, at a point immediately before the pick-up means. 
A tail (also called a leader) is a strip, which is 
separated from the web at the wet end of a paper machine, 
ahead of the press section, in order to facilitate the 
threading of the web through the machine. For the 
cutting, usually water jets are used which encounter the 
paper web at relatively high pressure in order to form  
 
edge trimmings and a trimmed web and, when applicable, a 
tail of predetermined width. One drawback is that, after 
slitting the paper web, the water jets spread so that 
water splashes all around the area. If the supporting 
fabric is a felt, as is the case in a crescent former, 
there is a considerable risk of fibres and fibre 
fragments being pressed into the felt and thereby giving 
rise to streaks in the paper web of final width when the 
tail cutting is complete. The pressure of the fluid jet 
must be limited in order to reduce the risk of the felt 
being damaged by the fluid jet. Repeated and extended 
tail cutting obviously increases said problem of fibres 
and fibre fragments being pressed into the felt, as well 
as the felt being damaged by the fluid jet even if the 
pressure thereof is maintained at a lower level. This in 
turn means that tail cutting

downstream of a point (A) where the outer fabric (4) of 

the two forming fabrics (4, 5) starts wrapping the 
forming roll (3). 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the web is cut on a forming roll (3) of a 

crescent former (1). 
A device for cutting a paper web in a paper machine 
comprising a twin wire former (1) including a forming 

roll (3) and two forming fabrics (4, 5) arranged to wrap 
a section of the forming roll (3) together with a 

recently formed paper web enclosed therebetween, said 
device comprising a first jet cutter (10) arranged to cut 

the web so that a paper web of final predetermined width 
is obtained and a second jet cutter (11) arranged to cut 

the web so that a tail is obtained, when applicable, 
characterized in that said jet cutters (10, 11) are  

 
arranged at a point on the forming roll (3) where the 

recently formed paper web (9) and the forming fabrics 
(4, 5) together wrap said section of the forming roll (3) 

in a sandwich structure. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that said jet cutters (10, 11) are arranged at a point on 

the forming roll (3) located about 30-120째, preferably
