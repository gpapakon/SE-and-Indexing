<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a miniaturised electronic device. The device is of the type including a substrate, one surface of which carries a first pattern (11) of metal elements of electrical circuits and a second pattern (15) of metal elements of electrical circuits, which cross over at least at certain points, the electrical circuit elements crossing over being separated by a dielectric material. The device is characterised in that it exhibits a multi-layer structure, that the dielectric material (6) is a screen-printable dielectric deposited in the form of a thick film in which the patterns (11, 15) of electrical circuits (12, 17) are arranged in different planes. The invention can be used for feedback of a device such as isolater circulation and reliable.
