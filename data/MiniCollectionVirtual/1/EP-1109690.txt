<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tarpaulin bow cover system for vehicles such as lorries or trailers, comprising a number of U-shaped bow members (4) which cover the width of a loading platform (1) of the vehicle and for opening or closing the cover by means of rollers or roller trolleys (2) can be displaced in the longitudinal direction of the loading platform (1) along running or guide rails (3) positioned along the two lateral sides of said loading platform (1). When the cover system is closed said bow members (4) on their bow elements (11), which define an upper limit, support a tarpaulin which covers the loading platform (1) or the loading area of the vehicle. A first terminal bow member (5) is immovably fixed to a face end of the loading platform (1) and a second mobile terminal bow member (6) is assigned to at least one fixing or locking device which is positioned at the other end of the loading platform (1). The aim of the invention is to provide a tarpaulin bow cover system which when the loading platform is sufficiently uncovered and the cover drawn back ensures that the tarpaulin is regularly folded between the bow members which are in close proximity to each other. To this end at least one U-shaped auxiliary bow member (10), which can be pivoted in a limited angular area about an axis of articulation parallel to the plane of the bow member, is arranged at the level of the bow member (4) and the length of the legs of the auxiliary bow member (10) is greater than the distance between the axis of articulation and the bow element (11) of the corresponding bow member (4).

Sliding-bow folding top for vehicles, such as lorries or trailers, comprising
a number of U-shaped sliding bows (4) which span the width of a loading

platform (1) of the vehicle and, for the opening and the closing of the
folding top, can be displaced in the longitudinal direction of the loading

platform (1) by means of rollers or roller carriages (2) on running and
guide rails (3) arranged along the two longitudinal sides 
of the loading
platform (1), the said sliding bows carrying, on their bow parts (11) which

define an upper boundary, a tarpaulin (18) which, when the folding top is
closed, covers the loading platform (1) or the loading compartment of the

vehicle, wherein a first end bow (5) is arranged in a fixed manner on the
one end of the loading platform (1) and a second, movable end bow (6)

is assigned at least to one securing or locking device (8) arranged at the
other end of the loading platform (1),
characterized in

that
 at least one U-shaped auxiliary bow (10) is arranged on the sliding
bow (4), which auxiliary bow can be pivoted through a limited angular

range about an axis of articulation (9) parallel to the plane of the sliding
bow (4), and
that
 the limb length of the auxiliary bow (10) is greater than the distance
(L) of the axis of articulation (9) from the bow part (11) of the associated

sliding bow (4).
Sliding-bow folding top according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each
sliding bow (4) is provided on both sides with a respective auxiliary bow

(10). 
Sliding-bow folding top according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

said at least one auxiliary bow (10) is connected to the tarpaulin (18).
Sliding-bow folding top according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 the tarpaulin (18) has a device (17) for enforcing folding during
opening of the folding top.
Sliding-bow folding top according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
that
 the tarpaulin (18) is connected at its two lower longitudinal edges via
semi-rigid elements (17) to the sliding bows (4) or to the roller carriages

(2) carrying the latter.
Sliding-bow folding top according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
that
 mutually adjacent sliding bows (4) are connected to one another by
means of wire-rope bows (17) fixed to the roller carriages (2) assigned to

the sliding bows, 
in that
 the tarpaulin (18) is provided at the lower end, in
each case over part of the maximum possible distance between two

adjacent sliding bows (4), with a hollow hem (19), and that the wire-rope
bows (17), which connect the adjacent sliding bows (4) to one another,

reach through the hollow-hem sections formed in the region of the lower
longitudinal edges of the tarpaulin (18).
Sliding-bow folding top according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
, in the
region of the fastening of the wire-rope bows (17) to the roller carriages

(2) or sliding bows (4), the tarpaulin (18) is provided in each case with a
length region (20) which is free of the hollow hem and whose length is

sufficient in order to enforce folding which is directed outwards with
respect to the loading platform (1), and that the wire-rope bows (17) are

furthermore assigned deflecting elements in order to enforce a curved
deflection. 
Sliding-bow folding top according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in
