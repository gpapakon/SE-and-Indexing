<ABSTRACT>
4-Phenyl 3-substituted 1,4-dihydropyridine esters are prepared by reacting benzaldehydes with keto esters and enamines, where appropriate with isolation of ylidene intermediates, or by esterification of corresponding dihydropyridinecarboxylic acids with alcohols. The 4-phenyl 3-substituted 1,4-dihydropyridine esters can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceuticals for the treatment of the central nervous system, in particular as cerebral therapeutic agents.
