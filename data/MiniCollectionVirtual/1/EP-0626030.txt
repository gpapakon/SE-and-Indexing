<ABSTRACT>
A storage facility designed as a giant container (10) radially symmetrical with respect to a vertical axis is composed of individual concrete segments. The wall area of the container is composed of two shells at least in a partial zone and forms an intermediate cavity for inspection purposes. The giant container (10) is essentially spherical and is composed of reinforced concrete prefabricated parts (20, 22) that have each an inner plate, an outer plate and a supporting member which links the plates leaving an intermediate cavity.
