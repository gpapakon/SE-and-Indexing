<ABSTRACT>
A machine (1) for renewing or laying a railway track has a machine frame (3) supported at the ends on travelling mechanisms (4, 5). The machine frame (3) has a pick-up device (7) for old sleepers, a depositing device (10) for new sleepers, a vertically adjustable ballast-levelling device as well as guide devices (13) for old or new rails (15). Both a rail travelling mechanism and a travelling mechanism (5) which is independent of the track and is vertically adjustable relative to the machine frame (3) are provided at one end of the machine frame (3). The travelling mechanism (5) independent of the track is designed so as to be releasable from the machine frame (3) by a first coupling (32). A second coupling (33) for connecting the travelling mechanism (5) independent of the track to the machine frame (3) is provided in the area of the rail travelling mechanism likewise releasable from the machine frame.

<CLAIMS>
A machine for renewing or laying a railway track, 
comprising a machine frame (3) supported at each end on 

undercarriages (4,5), on which frame there are provided a 
device (7) for picking up old sleepers, a device (10) for 

laying new sleepers, a vertically adjustable ballast grading 
device (9) located between them and also guide means (12,13) 

for old and new rails (14,15) respectively, wherein there are 
arranged at one end of the machine frame (3) both an on-track 

undercarriage (4) and an off-track undercarriage (5) which is 
vertically adjustable in relation to the machine frame (3), 

characterised in that the off-track undercarriage (5) is 
designed so as to be separable from the machine frame (3) by 

means of a first coupling (32), and a second coupling (33) is 
provided in the region of the on-track undercarriage (4), 

which is similarly separable from the machine frame, for 
connecting the off-track undercarriage (5) to the machine 

frame (3). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
device (10) for laying new sleepers is arranged between the 

on-track undercarriage (4), secured to the end of the machine 
frame, and the off-track undercarriage (5) associated 

therewith and adjacent thereto with respect to the 
longitudinal direction of the machine. 
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the off-track undercarriage (5) is designed as a 

steerable, caterpillar-tracked undercarriage (11) with two 
track chains (36) spaced apart from one another in the 

transverse direction of the machine. 
A machine according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
caterpillar-tracked undercarriage (11) has a pedestal (37), 

disposed centrally with respect to the track chains (36), with  
 

a centreing pin (39) secured to the top thereof for support on 
the machine frame (3). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that the second coupling (33) for the off-track 

undercarriage (5) or caterpillar-tracked undercarriage 
(11) is formed by a bearing-intermediate part (40), the lower 

end of which has an opening (43) for the insertion of the 
centreing pin (39) and the upper end of which may be connected 

to the machine frame (3). 
A machine according to one of claims 3 to 5,
 
characterised in that the caterpillar-tracked u
ndercarriage 
(11) is secured to the machine frame (3) by means of securing 

supports (44), extending at an angle to the track plane and 
linked to the pedestal (37), at a point situated at a distance 

from the bearing-intermediate part (40) in the longitudinal 
direction of the machine. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in that both in the region of the first and also 

of the second coupling (32,33), hydraulic couplings (42,46) 
are provided for the coupling of hydraulic lines (47) 

connected to the off-track undercarriage (5) and serving to 
supply energy to a motive drive (45). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 7,
 
characterised in that an auxiliary undercarriage (34), 

associated with the off-track undercarriage (5), is connected 
to the machine frame (3) for vertical adjustment by means of a 

drive (48). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 8,
 
characterised in that a ballast excavating device (8), 

connected for vertical adjustment to the machine frame (3), 
with a discharge conveyor belt (49) associated therewith and 

extending in the transverse direction of the machine, and also  
 

a ballast grading device (9) are provided between the device 
(7) for picking up old sleepers and the device (10) for laying 

new sleepers. 
A machine according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
distance apart of the two track chains (36) in the transverse 

direction of the machine is about 900 mm and the track chains 
(36) of the caterpillar-tracked undercarriage (11) are 

provided with a motive drive (45) which may be operated in 
both directions of rotation.
