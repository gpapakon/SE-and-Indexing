<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a power circuit package (45) 
having a porous base structure (20) electrically isolated 

from a first porous die mount (21) and a second porous 
die mount (22) by a dielectric material (29). The porous 

base structure (20) is bonded to a second surface of the 
the dielectric material (29) whereas the first porous die 

mount (21), and the second porous die mount (22) are 
bonded to a first surface of the dielectric material 

(29). Simultaneous with the bonding step, the porous 
base structure (20), the first porous die mount (21), and 

the second porous die mount (22) are impregnated with a 
conductive material. Semiconductor die (32, 33, 34, and 

35) are bonded to the impregnated die mounts. The 
semiconductor die (32, 33, 34, and 35) are then 

encapsulated by a molding compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to methods of 
forming circuit packages, and more particularly, to a 
method for forming a semiconductor power circuit package. Semiconductor devices are encapsulated within 
packages for protection from damage by external stresses 
and to provide a means for carrying electrical signals to 
and from the devices. Included in the repertoire of 
semiconductor device package types are dual-in-line 
packages, pin grid array packages, TAB packages, and 
multichip modules. More particularly, power 
semiconductor device packages may be formed as modules 
having a high thermal conductivity which are capable of 
dissipating large amounts of heat. One type of power semiconductor device module 
includes a copper baseplate to which an isolation pad is 
mounted. The isolation pad may include a ceramic layer 
sandwiched between two thin copper sheets. One of the 
thin copper sheets is bonded to the copper baseplate 
wherein the copper baseplate serves as a heat sink. 
Semiconductor die are mounted to the second thin copper 
sheet and a leadframe is attached to the semiconductor 
die. Subsequently, the semiconductor die and a portion 
of the leadframe are encapsulated by a molding compound. Although methods for manufacturing modules for 
power semiconductor devices have been taught in the prior 
art, these modules are not optimized for heat 
dissipation. In particular, the isolation pad and the 
copper baseplate have significantly different 
coefficients of thermal expansion. Thus, under  
 
conditions of high heat dissipation the copper baseplate 
may expand at a faster rate than the isolation pad 
thereby warping the isolation pad and potentially 
decreasing the reliability of the module. In addition, 
delamination of the thin copper sheets from the ceramic 
layer may result from mismatches between the coefficients 
of thermal expansion of the thin copper sheets and the 
ceramic layer. Further, long power leads are typically soldered to 
the semiconductor device die. The die are not only 
stressed by the step of soldering the leads to the die 
but they are mechanically stressed by external forces 
which may be applied to the leads. In addition, the use 
of the long power leads inherently introduces both a 
parasitic inductance and a parasitic resistance, 
particularly at high operating frequencies. Other 
disadvantages include a requirement for a large number of 
piece parts and extra processing steps to form the parts 
into a package thereby increasing the cost of the 
package.
