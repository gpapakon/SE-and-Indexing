<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a self-adhesive flexible strip applicable 
to containers or bottles or the like, said strip having a bail 

which can be lifted away from the container to serve as a handle 
for suspending the container from a support hook or the like. 
The strip is constructed of polymeric material of high mechanical 
strength and of very high ultimate elongation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flexible strip with bail for
suspending containers, bottles or the like in particular bottles
containing pharmaceutical products for drip-injection into a
patient's vein.The flexible strip is substantially in the form of a self-adhesive
label applicable to the outer surface of a bottle, in proximity to
its base or bottom. It comprises a cut which separates the main
part of the label from a narrower portion acting as a handle for
hooking the bottle to a support element. This handle (without
adhesive or with the adhesive neutralized) remains attached and
connected at its two ends to the main part of the label.Many containers, in particular bottles containing substances to be
injected into the patient's vein by drip, have to be suspended
from a support with their mouth facing downwards for use.For this purpose devices of various kinds are used, such as cages
(generally of plastics construction), spirals etc., which have to
be fitted to the bottle immediately before its use. The drawbacks
of these systems are well known and will not be further described,
being amply illustrated in DE-A-3631021, EP-A-386753, EP-B-99376
and in its corresponding US-A-4396128. The aforesaid patents all
describe container and bottle hooking and support systems
consisting of thin flexible plastics labels which are applied (via
an adhesive previously spread over each label) to the outer
surface of the bottle, in proximity to its bottom end. Of the various devices proposed, those of most interest are
described in EP-B-99376 and its equivalent US-A-4396128, and in
EP-A-386753 which is very similar to EP-B-99376, to which
reference will now be made.EP-B-99376 describes a bail structure comprising an elongate-polymeric
strip including a handle portion and two end anchor
portions adapted to be adhered to opposite sides of a container.During use, the bail structure is fixed, by an adhesive previously
spread over it, to the outer surface in proximity to its bottom
end. The handle portion is free of adhesive, or the adhesive
which was applied to it is neutralized by various known methods.
The handle portion can be moved from a storage position adjacent
the bottom end of a container to a use position extending across
the bottom end of the container, thus enabling the handle portion
to be used to suspend the container.The handle portion (which is formed from the polymeric strip
material and is necessarily of very small transverse dimensions)
has to be sufficiently strong to support the weight of the
container to

<CLAIMS>
In combination, a container to be suspended from a support with Its mouth facing downwards
for use; a structure consisting of a flexible strip of polyamide material in the form of a self-adhesive

label applicable to the outer surface of said container (7) comprising a profiled cut (3) which
separates a main part (1) of said flexible strip from a narrower portion (2), said cut (3) having its

ends lying on the diameter of the container, the narrower portion (2) is provided with a pullable
outwardly extending portion

   characterised in that

the narrower portion (2), under traction of said outwardly extending portion (5), is deformable and
elongatable to

at least three times the original length before its breakage to form a bail structure for
the vertical suspension of the container.
A combination container and a structure consisting of a flexible strip according to claim 1

   further characterised in that

the narrower portion (2) is glue-free.
A combination container and a structure consisting of a flexible strip according to claim 1 and 2

   further characterised in that

the width of the narrower portion (2) ranges between 3 and 6 mm.
A combination container and a structure consisting of a flexible strip according to the preceding
claims

   characterised in that

the suspended container is allowed to oscillate freely around the two ends of the elongated
narrower portion (2), said ends connected to the main portion of the label.
A combination container and a structure consisting of a flexible strip as claimed in claims 1-4

   characterised in that

the flexible strip is made of nylon 6 or polycaprolactam.
