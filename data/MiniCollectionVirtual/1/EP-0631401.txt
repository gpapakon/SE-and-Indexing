<ABSTRACT>
A communication apparatus transmits a test message 
in one direction by the transmitting unit having narrow 

directivity capable of changing the transmitting 

direction, and an indication message which indicates 
that the test message is being transmitted by a 

transmitting unit having non directivity. Accordingly, 
the indication message is transmitted at least to the 

communicating party's apparatus. Subsequently, the 
transmitting direction of the test message is 

sequentially changed, and a similar process is 
performed. When the communicating party's apparatus 

detects a reception of the indication message, 
information indicating a level of the test message is 

transmitted to the transmitting apparatus as a response. 
The communication apparatus at the transmitting side 

detects the direction where the communicating party 
exists by receiving the information indicating the 

level. Hereinafter, the information communication is 
performed to adjust the transmitting unit of narrow 

directivity to the determined direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication
apparatus and a control method of the communication apparatus and, more particularly, to
a communication apparatus and a control method of the communication apparatus capable of
communicating by lights and waves (such as
electromagnet, acoustic, etc.) without using wires.Recently, an apparatus which performs information
communication through lights and waves without using
wires between computers or the computer and peripheral
apparatuses has been spreading. The conventional
apparatus has communication means of a single system
whose directional significance including non-directional
significance (even if a plurality of channels can be
provided) is unchangeable.In general, a wave intensity in wave propagation is
in inverse proportion ratio to the square of distance.
Accordingly, if communication in a certain distance is
performed at the minimum output (electric power), output
means or input means including a narrow directivity
(e.g., Yagi Antenna or Parabolic Antenna) is used.
Accordingly, the conventional technique is suitable for
communication among fixed apparatuses since the
directivity of the input/output means is fixed. However, the conventional technique is not suitable
when at least one apparatus is not fixed, for example,
when one apparatus is a portable terminal and the other
is the host apparatus of the portable terminal, and both
are used in a same room (or same floor). In this case,
the problem arises in that a user needs to adjust the
direction of the input/output means whenever the
portable terminal is moved.If a wide directivity or non-directivity is used
for the input/output means, the above problem can be
solved. However, in this case, considerably large
amount of power output is required in comparison with
the case of the narrow directivity, thus large amount of
electric power is consumed.Document EP 0 483 549 A2 discloses a data
communication apparatus and method and a wireless
communication system that employs a high speed data
channel and a separate, lower speed diffuse transmission
control channel for communicating information between one
or more remote stations and a base station. In a
preferred embodiment the remote stations are mobile,
handheld workstations bidirectionally coupled to the base
station(s) through an infrared radiation signal carrier.
The data communication apparatus described in this
document provides the basis for the preamble of claim 1. Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a
