<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of media drive assemblies 
which include a magnetoresistive (MR) head and, more particularly, relates to 
setting the magnetic state of a thin film magnetoresistive element during manufacture 
of drive assemblies. The prior art discloses magnetoresistive (MR) reproducing heads that operate 
based on the magnetoresistive effect exhibited by thin films composed of certain 
materials. A read head incorporating an MR transducer detects magnetic 
field signals through the resistance changes of an MR transducer element as a 
function of the amount and direction of the magnetic flux being sensed by the 
MR transducer element. Responsive to the drive toward increased recording density, batch fabrication 
processes have been developed for efficient, high volume production of 
miniaturized MR transducers. Typically, a batch fabrication process for MR 
transducers employs known thin film manufacturing techniques to produce a 
plurality of such transducers on a wafer in "wafer level" processing. A wafer 
is then sliced row-wise into a 1 x n array of transducers which are polished in 
"row-level" processing and then individuated by cutting rows into separate 
sliders. Each slider includes a head structure with an MR reproducing head. 
It is known to selectively vary construction details and manufacturing parameters 
in order to yield an MR transducer having a particular magnetic state 
which optimizes transducer operation. In this regard, an MR transducer may 
comprise soft or hard biasing elements and may be produced by a batch process 
in which magnetic fields are applied at certain steps during wafer level 
processing. These components set magnetic characteristics of the thin film MR  
 
layer ("the MR stripe") such as magnetization direction, field orientation, and 
so on. See, for example, C.D. Mee et al, "MAGNETIC RECORDING, Vol. 
I", McGraw-Hill, New York, 1987, pp. 270-302. The magnetic characteristics of the MR stripe are initialized by the application 
of a magnetic field to the MR head. Currently, the initialization step takes 
place at the wafer level and at the row level, depending upon the circumstances 
and requirements of manufacturing and assembly. However, some processing operations that occur during and after row-level 
processing have been proved to alter the magnetic state of MR transducers. 
In this regard, the inventors have concluded that intentional and accidental 
insults to an MR transducer occurring during and after row level processing 
can
