<ABSTRACT>
A device for tension control of a cassette tape recorder includes a slider 
32, a tension band holder 30 and a tension arm 42. The slider 32 is 

resiliently mounted on a guide rod 34 of the tension band holder 30 and the 
tension arm 42 has a tension pin 44 for rotating under the tension of the 

travelling tape 26, for being minutely clutched according to the tension of the 
tape to accurately and minutely control the tension of the tape. The slider 32 

and the tension arm 42 are positioned on different decks respectively so as to 
be suitable for a pocket-sized camcorder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the control of tape tension in, for 
example, a cassette tape recorder and/or player. Generally, tape recorders record and reproduce signals to and from a 
cassette tape by mode conversion after loading the cassette tape on a drum in 
a deck. The tape is transferred along a certain travelling path on the deck, 
and a certain tension is applied to the tape, to prevent the transferring status 
of the tape becoming unstable due to the structural features of the deck. Now, referring to Figure 1 of the accompanying diagrammatic 
drawings, a conventional device for controlling tape tension is explained in 
more detail. A tension belt or band 12 is wound around a supply reel 10. One side 
of the band 12 contacts a lever 18 arranged to rotate about a hinge 14 under 
the resilient bias of a spring member 16 elastically mounted on the lever 18, 
and the other side of the band contacts a lever 21 of a tension arm 22 having 
a tension pole 20. A screw member 24 is mounted at one end of the lever 18 so that the 
lever 18 rotates pivotally around the hinge 14 in response to loosening or 
fastening the screw member 24, and the tension band 12 passing around the 
supply reel 10 is tightened or slackened in response to the pivotal movement 
of the lever 18, thereby to control the rotation of the supply reel 10.  In more detail, if the screw member 24 is loosened, the lever 18 rotates 
pivotally in direction of an arrow "A" about the hinge 14 due to the resilience 
of the spring member 16 and the tension band 12 connected with the lever 18 
moves upwardly, as seen in Figure 1. Similarly, the lever 21 connected with the tension arm 22 is pulled in 
direction of an arrow "B", so that the tension arm 22 rotates pivotally in 
direction of an arrow "C" about a hinge 23. Therefore, a proper back tension 
of a tape 26 can be maintained. However, this conventional device for controlling tape tension has 
problems in that, since the tension band 12 controls the rotation of the supply 
reel 10 by means of the lever 18 pivoting on the hinge 14, the difference 
between a winding angle of the tension band 12 against the supply reel 10 and 
a reference value increases and it is impossible to control the back tension of 
the tape stably. Another problem is that, due to the number and size of the necessary 
components, the whole size of the product is relatively large. In particular, 
since the tension band 12 wound around the supply reel 10 is fixed on the 
tension arm 22 and the lever 18 is maintained

a supply reel (10) of a tape recorder; and 
   a tension arm (42) which is mounted for pivotal movement and carries 

a tension pole (47) adapted to bear against a recording tape (26), in use: 
   wherein: 

   a slider (32) is mounted for sliding movement on said tension band 
holder (30); 

   a resilient bias means (38) urges said slider in a direction of sliding 
movement on said tension band holder (30); 

   said tension band (12) has one end secured to said tension band holder 
(30) and another end secured to said slider (32); and 

   said tension arm (42) and said slider (32) have interengaging abutment 
portions (44,46) so as to transmit movement between said tension arm (42) 

and said slider (32). 
A device according to claim 1, wherein said tension band holder (30) 
is provided with a guide rod (34) on which said slider (32) is slidably 

mounted. 
A device according to claim 2, wherein said slider (32) is formed with 
a guide hole (36) through which said guide rod (34) passes, and said guide 

hole (36) and said guide rod (34) are of corresponding polygonal cross-section. 
A device according to claim 3, wherein said polygonal cross-section is 
a substantially square cross-section. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein said 
tension arm (42) carries a pin (44) which serves as one of said abutment 

portions (44,46). 
In combination, a tension controlling device according to any of the 
preceding claims, and a tape supply reel (10), wherein said tension band 

holder (30) is secured adjacent to said supply reel (10).
