<ABSTRACT>
Wound healing compositions comprise from 1 to 20% by weight 
of a gel forming polysaccharide such as carboxymethyl 

cellulose and from 15 to 50% by weight of hexylene glycol. 
Such compositions are strongly antimicrobial, but show low 

toxicity to fibroblasts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ointment for the treatment of
wounds, and particularly for the treatment of ulcers.Bactericidal ointments for the treatment of wounds are well
known. Such ointments typically contain an antibiotic or an
anti-bacterial agent in an inert vehicle or carrier, such as
a paraffin base ointment or an oil-in-water emulsion.
Antibiotics which are used include gentamycin sulphate and
neomycin sulphate, while anti-bacterial agents include
cetrimide, chlorhexidine gluconate and silver sulphadiazine.Pharmaceutical ointments (and also cosmetic compositions)
quite commonly contain a topically acceptable glycol, most
usually propylene glycol. Such glycols have primarily been
used in the past for their solvent and humectant properties.
It is also known, however, that glycols possess some
antibacterial and antifungal properties, and they have
therefore also been used as preservatives in cosmetic
preparations. Kinnunen and Koskela, Acta. Derm. Venereal
(Stockholm) 71:148 to 150 (1991) report on the antimicrobial
properties of aqueous solutions of three glycols (propylene
glycol, hexylene glycol and 1,3-butylene glycol) against
Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mitis and
Escherichia coli in vitro. The results indicated that
hexylene glycol, in aqueous solution, is a more potent
antimicrobial agent than propylene glycol and butylene
glycol in vitro. According to the authors, these results
speak in favour of using hexylene glycol in cosmetic and
dermatological preparations instead of propylene glycol and
1,3-butylene glycol, but the authors also acknowledge that
the antibacterial properties of dermatological formulations
containing hexylene glycol might differ from those of
aqueous solutions of hexylene glycol. Moreover, the results
of these authors were contrary to the findings of Harb &
Toama, Drug Cosm. Ind. 118:40-137 (1976), that butylene 
glycol should be more effective than other polyols against
common bacteria and yeasts.WO84/00111 discloses a heat sterilizable aqueous gel
composition for use in the treatment of wounds, comprising
a pharmaceutically acceptable glycol, preferably propylene
glycol, and a cellulose derivative. According to the
specification, the composition is believed to exert an
inherent bacteriostatic action and to have a degree of
activity against a range of viruses or mycelia. It is said
to be effective as the sole agent in the treatment of clean
superficial burns, cuts, wounds, abrasions and the
