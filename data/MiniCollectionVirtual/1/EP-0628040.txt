<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to indole derivatives which
have steroid 5α-reductase inhibitory activity.More particularly this invention relates to indoles,
their preparation and their use as testosterone-5α-reductase
inhibitors.The androgen class of steroidal hormones is
responsible for the difference in the physical
characteristics of males and females. Of all the organs
that produce androgens, the testes produce these hormones
in the greatest amounts. Over-production of these
hormones in the body results in many undesirable physical
manifestations and disease states, e.g. acne vulgaris,
alopecia, seborrhoea, female hirsutism, benign prostatic
hypertrophy and male pattern baldness.The principal androgen secreted by the testes is
testosterone and it is the primary androgen present in
male plasma. The principal mediator of androgenic
activity in certain organs such as the prostate and
sebaceous gland are the 5α-reduced androgens.
Testosterone is therefore the prohormone of 5α-dihydrotestosterone
which is formed locally in the above
organs by the action of testosterone-5α-reductase. The
presence of elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone in
many disease states has therefore focussed attention on
the synthesis of testosterone 5α-reductase inhibitors.Testosterone 5α-reductase inhibitors may also be
useful in the treatment of human prostate
adenocarcinomas.EP-A-0458207 discloses indole derivatives with
testosterone 5α-reductase inhibitory activity.The present invention provides compounds of the
formula:- 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,

wherein
X is O, NH, N(C1-C4 alkyl), direct link, C1-C4
alkylene, C2-C4 alkenylene or C2-C4 alkynylene,

optionally substituted by C1-C4 alkyl or aryl;Y is methylene, C2-C6 alkylene optionally
interrupted by O, C2-C6 alkenylene or C2-C6
alkynylene, all of which may be optionally
substituted by C1-C6 alkyl, or is a group of the
formula:-

wherein m and n are each independently selected
from O and an integer of from 1 to 5, with the
proviso that the sum of m and n is not greater
than 5, and p is an integer of from 2 to 6;R is H, OH, halo, C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4 alkoxy;R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each independently selected
