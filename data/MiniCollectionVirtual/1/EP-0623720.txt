<ABSTRACT>
A pawl latch (3) that provides an integral gripping feature to 
facilitate 

opening panels and a visual indication of latch closure. The front 
portion of the latch (3) 

has two pieces (1,2). In the open position, the two pieces (1,2) are 
positioned with respect to 

each other so that the top piece (1) reveals a colored face of the 
bottom piece (2). The 

colored face of the bottom piece (2) can be observed at great distances 
from the latch. 

In the closed position, the top piece (1) totally covers the bottom 
piece (2) so that no color 

is visible on the latch (3). Further, in the open position, the front 
piece (1) is at right angles 

to the bottom piece (2), and the front piece (1) is positioned away 
from the panel (10) so that it 

can be easily grasped with two fingers to allow the opening of an 
attached panel (10). 

Also, the latch (3) is designed to be attached to a surface of the 
panel (10) that is not 

horizontal to a frame (14) to which the panel (10) is to be secured to 
by the latch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pawl latch and, in particular, to a latch that 
provides a visual indication of closure and a gripping mechanism. In the prior art, thumb screw pawl latches are commonly used to secure 
doors of sub-cabinets and small equipment enclosures. Such latches can be operated 
by a user's fingers, screw driver or key. Prior art thumb screw pawl latches suffered 
from two problems. First, the visual indication of whether the latch is closed or not 
is very poor and consists only of the position of the thumb screw, screw driver slot or 
key slot. This position cannot be accurately determined at any distance from the 
latch. Second, the prior art thumb screw pawl latches do not provide a convenient 
means for gripping the latch in order to open the attached door or panel. The 
gripping mechanism has been provided by using two general mechanisms. The first 
is to extend the collar surrounding the thumb screw such that the operator's fingers 
can grip the collar. The other method is to make a bail wire an integral part of the 
latch. The operator then inserts his/her finger into the wire bail and utilizes this to 
open the door or panel. These two gripping mechanisms have been proven 
unsatisfactory for a variety of human factors and space utilization reasons. The problem then is to provide a thumb screw pawl latch which has a 
simple mechanism for determining closure at a distance and a straight forward 
means for gripping the latch. The foregoing problems are solved, and a technical advance is achieved 
by a thumb screw pawl latch that provides an integral gripping feature to facilitate 
opening doors and a visual indication of latch closure. The front portion of the latch 
has two pieces. In the open position, the two pieces are positioned with respect to 
each other so that the top piece reveals a colored face of the bottom piece. The 
colored face of the bottom piece can be observed at great distances from the latch. 
In the closed position, the top piece totally covers the bottom piece so that no color 
is visible on the latch. Further, in the open position, the front piece is at right angles 
to the bottom piece, and the front piece is positioned away from the panel so that it 
can be easily grasped with two fingers to allow the opening of the attached door.  Advantageously, the latch is designed to be attached to a surface of the 
panel that is not horizontal to a frame to which the panel is to be secured to by the 
latch. Other and further aspects of the present invention will

<CLAIMS>
Pawl latch attached to a panel for securing the panel to a supporting 
frame (14), the pawl latch comprising: 

   a barrel (2) secured to the panel and having a front face; 
   a spindle (1) inserted through the barrel and having a front face; 

   a pawl (3) secured to the back portion of the spindle with respect to the 
front face of the spindle and holding the latch to the frame by a portion of the pawl 

contacting the frame when the latch is in the locked position and releasing the latch 
from the frame when the latch is in the unlocked position; and 

   the front face of the spindle overlapping the front face of barrel when 
the latch is in the locked position so that the front face of the barrel is not visible and 

the front face of the spindle allowing a portion of the front face of barrel to be visible 
when the latch is in the unlocked position so that the unlocked position can be 

determined by observation. 
The latch of claim 1 wherein the front face of the barrel is a first color 
and the front face of the spindle is a second color. 
The latch of claim 1 wherein the front face of the barrel is of a first 
texture and the front face of the spindle is of a second texture. 
The latch of claim 1 wherein the front surface of the panel is slanted 
with respect to the front surface of the frame to which the panel is secured and a 

surface of the barrel in contact with the front surface of the panel is angled so as to 
position the spindle perpendicular to the front surface of the frame whereby the 

portion of the pawl making contact with the frame moves in an arc that is horizontal 
to the front surface of the frame. 
The latch of claim 1 further comprising a spring (6) for pushing the 
spindle away from the barrel so that in the unlocked position the spindle is pushed 

away from the panel to which the barrel is attached, and in the unlocked position, 
front face of the spindle is perpendicular to front face of the barrel with the front face 

of barrel and the front face of the spindle each laying a horizontal plane with respect 
to each other and the end portions of the spindle extend beyond the sides portion of 

the barrel allowing a user of the latch to grasp the end portions of the spindle to pull 
the panel away from the frame
. 
The latch of claim 5 wherein the front face of the barrel is a first color 
and the front face of the spindle is a second color. 
The latch of claim 5 wherein the front face of the barrel is of a first 
texture and the front face of the spindle is of a second texture. 
The latch of claim 5 wherein the front surface of the panel is slanted 
with respect to the front surface of the frame to which the panel is secured and a 

surface of the barrel in contact with the front surface of the panel is angled so as to 
position the spindle perpendicular to the front surface of the frame whereby the 

portion of the pawl making contact with the frame moves in an arc that is horizontal 
to the front surface of the frame.
