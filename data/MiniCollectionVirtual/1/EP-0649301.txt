<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a nonionic cold mix emulsion and preparation thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a cosmetic composition in the form of a cream preparation which comprises a discontinuous phase dispersed in a continuous phase. The continuous phase contains water, an emulsifier, and at least one oxidizing agent. The discontinuous phase contains salts of fatty acid esters of lactylic acid, saturated monoglycerides and propylene glycol monoesters. The emulsions are particularly suitable as components of oxidizing preparations for the bleaching of hair and for the dying of hair with oxidation hair dyes and hair bleaches.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nonionic cold mix 
emulsion and preparation thereof. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a cosmetic composition 
in the form of a cream preparation which comprises a 
discontinuous phase dispersed in a continuous phase. 
The continuous phase contains water, an emulsifier, and 
at least one oxidizing agent. The discontinuous phase 
contains salts of fatty acid esters of lactylic acid, 
saturated monoglycerides and propylene glycol 
monoesters. The emulsions are particularly suitable as 
components of oxidizing preparations for the bleaching 
of hair and for the dying of hair with oxidation hair 
dyes and hair bleaches. The main coloring component of hair is a dark 
pigment, melanin, which occurs as granules embedded in 
the hair cortex. The aim of bleaching is to decolorize 
selectively the pigments in the hair with minimal damage 
to the hair matrix. When hair is bleached, the color 
changes to lighter and lighter shades depending upon the 
amount of melanin granules dissolved and removed from 
the hair fiber. More specifically, bleaching occurs in 
two steps: (1) initial solubilization of the color 
granules and (2) decolorization of the dark brown 
solubilized pigment. The reaction between 
melano-protein and oxidizing compound is confined mainly 
to the protein-combined cystene residues which are 
subsequently converted to combined cysteic acid. The 
solubilization of the melanin granules is connected with  
 
the splitting of the disulfide bridges in the melano 
protein. The bleaching process can be halted at any point or 
can be permitted to continue to a light blonde or 
platinum shade. The latter provides a good background 
for a variety of tints which can be obtained by a 
subsequent coloring step. Such bleaching and coloring 
combination is known as a double process coloring and 
causes hair damage by promoting porosity, brittleness, 
dryness and loss of tensile strength. Problems are 
encountered when the consistency of the dye or bleach 
preparation is too low, particularly the problem of the 
dye or bleach preparation running along the hair and 
causing undesired dyeing or bleaching of certain parts 
of the hair. It has long been known that alkali-soluble acrylate 
dispersions may be used for thickening aqueous systems. 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,931 discloses an aqueous dispersion 
of a copolymer of ethyl acrylate, methacrylic acid, 
acrylic acid and a polyethylenically unsaturated 
copolymerizable monomer. The polyethylenically 
unsaturated
