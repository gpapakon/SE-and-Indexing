<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for viewing two-dimensional images with a three-dimensional effect utilizes a stack of closely spaced, thin plates, producing a multiple interferometer effect via inter and intra plate reflections between the plates. A conventional two-dimensional image, such as a print or a back-lighted transparency or a video screen may be viewed through the stack of plates, so as to give an appearance and attributes of three dimensions, via the multiple interferometer effect. In a second embodiment, dedicated images may be produced by photographing or videotaping or otherwise recording images through the stack of plates. When such a dedicated image (44) is later viewed (48) through the stack of plates (52), a further enhanced three-dimensional effect is observed. In preferred embodiments the stack of plates includes about 10 to 100 thin plates, in closely and evenly spaced relationship.

<DESCRIPTION>
 THREE DIMENSIONAL VIEWING APPARATUS AND METHODS P E C I F I C A T I O NBackground of the InventionThe present invention relates to the field of optics, and more particularly to a specific apparatus and process for three dimensional (3-D) image presentation.Workers in the photographic and optics fields have long sought practical methods and systems for presenting images in 3-D to viewers, including 3-D presentations of video screen images, transparency images or printed images.An object of this invention is to provide a display apparatus and method that simulates a surprisingly realistic 3-D effect when viewing a normally flat two dimensional (2-D) image. In accordance with the invention, any 2-D image may be so viewed, including photographic images, video or computer screens, drawings, paintings or sketches. The images may be still or motion, black and white or colored, printed or broadcast, complex or sketchy.A further object of this invention is to provide 3-D presentations of images recorded, processed, and presented using conventional 2-D means. For example, conventional (2- D) TV broadcasts are not affected in any way while viewers, eguipped with an optically active device of the invention, will experience realistic depth of field image viewing.Thus, no special processing of the image or broadcast signal is reguired — no "3-D dedicated" broadcast is required (which may be distorted to the naked eye). 

 The same advantage of "undedicated" image presentation also applies to any image distribution means such as recorded video signals (i.e. from video cassette recordings), computer generated graphics (i.e. , computer games) , printed or published images, motion picture viewing, single or mass produced slides, postcards, photographs, etc.A further and related object of this invention is to provide a realistic 3-D view of 2-D images without the need for "stereo glasses", usually required to view conventional 3-D stereo photographs. Such glasses provide a means to assure that each eye only sees its respective image from two photographs taken from slightly displaced points of view. The isolation of each eye can be by, for example, alternating polarization, color filtration or by alternate time-divided occlusion of each eye's vision, in timing with a shifting of images in a moving picture. Viewers not equipped with such glasses see a blurred or double image. In addition, some individuals have difficulty fusing the separate images, failing to experience an illusion of depth, or experience headaches with
