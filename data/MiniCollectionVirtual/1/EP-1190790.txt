<ABSTRACT>
Valve arrangement (1) comprises a plunger (3) connected to a die casting mold for closing a channel of the inner chamber of the mold. A lining (20) is inserted into a bore (19) in which the plunger can be pushed and removed. Preferred Features: The lining material has a higher wear resistance than the material of the valve arrangement. The lining material is made e.g. of steel X38 CrMoV5 1 containing 0.36 C, 1.1. Si, 5.0 Cr, 1.1 Mo and 0.4 V. The surface of the lining is hardened by nitriding, nitrocarburizing, quenching or aging.

Valve arrangement (1) for a diecasting die, more particularly a venting valve arrangement for diecasting, comprising at least one piston (3, 17) communicating with the diecasting die and closing a duct leading to the interior of the diecasting die, a bushing (18, 20) being inserted in a bore (19, 21), in which bushing the piston is displaceably arranged, 
characterised in that
 the bushing is fastened in the bore in such a manner as to be removable in order to be able to replace the bushing in the case of wear.
Arrangement (1) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the material of the bushing (18, 20) has a higher wear resistance than the material of the body of the valve arrangement (1) in order to increase wear resistance.
Arrangement (1) according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 at least one bushing (18, 20) consists of one of the following materials, the relative amounts of the components being indicated in weight percent:

- steel X53 CrMnNi N 21 9, in particular with the following average values for the relative amounts of the components: 0.48 to 0.58 C; 0.25 Si; 8.0 to 10.0 Mn; 20.0 to 22.0 Cr; 3.25 to 4.50 Ni; 0.35 to 0.5 N;
- hot-work steel;
- hot-work steel, lined with ceramics.
- X32 CrMoV 3 3, in particular with the following relative amounts of the components: 0.28 to 0.35 C; 0.1 to 0.4 Si; 0.15 to 0.45 Mn; 2.7 to 3.2 Cr; 2.6 to 3.0 Mo; 0.4 to 0.7 V.
Arrangement (1) according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

Arrangement (1) according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 it is a venting valve and a piston is the valve piston (1) of the venting valve.
Arrangement (1) according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 at least one bushing (18, 20), preferably all bushings are provided, at least in an effective section (22, 27) adjacent to the connection to the casting mould and at least on the inside, with a layer (31, 33) having a higher wear resistance than the base material.
Arrangement (1) according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 at least one bushing (18, 20), preferably all bushings, consist of a high-strength hot-work steel having a tensile strength of at least approx. 1700 N/mm

Arrangement (1) according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the hot-work steel has a hardness of at least 1,000 HV
20
, preferably at least 1,100 HV
20
 at its surface.
Arrangement (1) according to one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the layer (31, 33) has a hardness of at least 2,200 HV
20
, preferably at least 2,400 HV
20
 at its surface.
Arrangement (1) according to one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the layer at the surface is produced by precipitation, particularly by means of a PVD process, and is of one of the following types: TiN; TiC; TiCN; TiAlCN; TiBCN.
Diecasting machine comprising a valve arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 10.
Method for the operation of the valve arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 a lubricant, particularly graphite suspended in oil, is applied to the inside of at least one bushing (18, 20), preferably of all bushings, in order to extend the lifetime of the bushing (18, 20).
