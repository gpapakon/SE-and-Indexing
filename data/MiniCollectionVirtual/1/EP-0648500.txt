<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to cardiology and presents a cardiotropic agent REFRAKTERIN based on the cardiac glycoside and the  beta -adrenergic stimulator and further contains nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, cytochrome C and inosine. REFRAKTERIN restores the contractility and increases the reserves of the myocardium in the pronounced and severe form of heart failure.
