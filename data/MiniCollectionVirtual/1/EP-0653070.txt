<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high speed power
analyzer for measuring electrical parameters in an alternating
waveform power system. Such a high speed power analyzer can be
used in systems for monitoring electrical power circuits, in
particular in a programmable system for measuring and calculating
electrical parameters from multiple power circuits. The present
invention further relates to a method of measuring electrical
parameters in an alternating waveform power system.The monitoring of electrical power is important to
ensure that this energy resource is effectively generated,
distributed and utilized. Utilities need to measure power coming
out of a generation station or going into a power station. In
addition, to minimize power transmission losses, it is important
to minimize the phase relationship between the current and voltage
waveforms of the power being transmitted. In industrial control
applications, it is important to be able to continuously monitor
the current and phase of the power into a machine which may vary
with the machine load.Traditional systems for monitoring power circuits
require the installation of individual measuring devices to
measure a specific power system parameter; for example, Watts,
Vars, Amps, or Volts. These devices typically comprise discrete
analog transducers which convert AC-voltage and current signals
from a power system into DC-output signals proportional to the
true power on the system. For example, typical utility revenue
kilowatt hour meters measure power in an analog fashion. Where a
data acquisition system must measure numerous circuits, requiring
separate measuring devices for each circuit can add greatly to the
overall cost of the system. Also, where a number of circuits are
being remotely monitored for computer processing and display, the
individual devices must be connected to a data acquisition device 
and suitably processed to Interface with the computer. Further,
multiple measuring devices greatly increase the overall error of
the system.The US-4,672,555 discloses a high speed power
analyzer for measuring electrical parameters in an alternating
waveform power system, which comprises input means for receiving
a plurality of analog input signals representing electrical
parameters of the power system. At least one of these analog input
signals represents a voltage signal
and at least one
of these analog input signals represents a current signal.
Further, multiplexer means, converter means and processor circuit
means are provided. The multiplexer
