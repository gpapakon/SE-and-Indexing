<ABSTRACT>
Methods for introducing proteins or nucleotide sequences into the nucleus using a novel receptor-mediated delivery system. The delivery system construct includes a cell receptor-binding domain, a cytoplasmic translocation domain, and a nuclear translocation signal domain. This system can transport functional macromolecule that will act once internalized into the nucleus.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE : TRANSLOCATION SIGNAL FACILITATED NUCLEARDELIVERY OF MACROMOLECULESFIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to methods of introducing foreign materials into a cell nucleus. More particularly, the present specification discloses methods for transporting nucleotide sequences or proteins into the nucleus using a novel translocation signal facilitated delivery system.BACKGROUNDIndividuals suffering from genetic diseases manifested by a deficiency in the expression of certain necessary proteins require augmentation with therapeutic doses of such proteins to lead normal lives. Currently, such treatment is mainly that of lifetime maintenance with periodic, exogenous introduction of the required protein. Such periodic treatment is cumbersome, expensive, and sometimes hazardous (such as for hemophiliacs who have a relatively high exposure rate to HIV). It is desirable to utilize biomolecular manipulation to augment such protein deficiencies by introducing DNA (which code for the deficient proteins), and other nucleotide sequences and polypeptides (which regulate the expression of the deficient proteins) into the cells of patients suffering from genetic deficiencies. For example, such treatment involves the introduction of genes and regulators for factor VIII for hemophiliacs and al- antitrypsin for patients suffering from hereditary emphysema or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Such approaches can even be extended to re-transform aberrant tumor cells in cancer patients. The most attractive manner for achieving such therapeutic transformation is to deliver a gene coding for the deficient gene product into the nucleus of somatic cells. In vitro delivery of foreign DNA into mammalian cells for gene expression has been achieved by three distinct approaches. The first approach takes advantage of the natural ability of viruses to infect cells and express viral DNA in the form of specific RNA and protein species (Cournoyer et al., 1991 , "Gene transfer of adenosine deaminase into primitive human hematopoetic progenitor cells". Human Gene Therapy, 2:203; Rosenberg et al., 1990, "Gene transfer into humans: immunotherapy of patients with advanced melanoma using infiltrating lymphocytes modified by 

retroviral gene transduction". New England Journal of Medicine, 323 :570). In particular, advantage has been taken of mammalian retroviruses as vector systems that permit infection of a variety of cell types and allow for expression of many different foreign genes.
