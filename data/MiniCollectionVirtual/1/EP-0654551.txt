<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an open-end spinning device with a rotor housing which is subjected to suction and is open at the front and in which a rotor rotates at a high rotational speed. Provided for closing the rotor housing is a cover element (7), the cover extension (18) of which is designed preferably as an exchangeable rotationally symmetrical component. The cover extension (18) is arranged releasably in a receptacle (33) of the cover element (7) by means of bearing faces (31) arranged at an inclination and axially acting fastening means (21) and is fixed exactly in position within this receptacle (33) by a locating means (26).

Open-end spinning device (1) with a suctioned rotor housing (2) open towards 
the front, a spinning rotor (3) turning at high speed inside the rotor housing (2) 

and a cover element (7) for closing the rotor housing (2), in which in a mount 
(33) of the cover element (7) a replaceable cover extension (18) is arranged 

able to be detached and secured precisely with an outlet region (22) of a fibre 
guiding channel (11) and a yarn draw-off nozzle (19)
 
characterised in that 


the cover extension (18) in the region of the fibre guiding channel transition 
from the cover element (7) to the cover extension (18) has a conical bearing 

surface (31) conforming with a corresponding bearing surface (34) of the cover 
element (7), 
the fibre guiding channel section (37) is inserted othogonally or almost 
orthogonally into the conical bearing surface (31) of the cover extension (18) 

and 
the bearing surfaces (31, 34) can be brought into an airtight position by 
securing means (21) acting in installation direction R. 
Open-end spinning device according to claim 1, characterised in that the fixing 
into position of the cover extension (18) inside the mount (33), in particular the 

angularly precise alignment of the cover element (18) is performed by means of 
a cylindrical pin (26), which is arranged in a fitting bore (35) of the cover 

element (7) and engages in a fitting bore (25) at the rear (36) of the cover 
extension (18). 
Cover element according to claim 1 and 2, characterised in that the cover 
extension (18) is designed as a rotationally symmetrical component, which can 

be secured replaceably with a backward conically designed bearing surface 
(31) onto a correspondingly shaped bearing surface (34) of the mount (33) and 

can be fixed into position precisely by a fitting means (26).  
 
Cover element according to claim 1 and 2, characterised in that the cover 
extension (18) is designed as a truncated pyramid-like component which can 

be secured replaceably with backward even bearing surfaces (31) onto 
correspondingly formed bearing surfaces (34) of the mount (33) 
Cover element according to claim 1, characterised in that the cover extension 
(18) on its rear side (36) has at least one threaded bore (30) for the 

engagement of a screw (21). 
Cover element according to one or several of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the cover extension (18) has a central through bore (24) 

for receiving a yarn draw-off nozzle (19) and a threaded bore (27) for a 
securing screw (28) arranged at an angle relative to the through bore (24) 
Cover element according to claim 6, characterised in that the threaded bore 
(27) is arranged orthogonally relative to the external line of the conical bearing 

surface (31). 
Cover element according to claim 6 and 7, characterised in that a threaded pin 
(28) arranged in the threaded bore (27) locking the yarn draw-off nozzle (19) is 

accessible via an assembly opening in the cover element (7) even with a fitted 
cover extension (18).
