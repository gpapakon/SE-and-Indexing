<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel halogenated polymer films or coatings for 
semiconductor processing systems which prevent by-product residue buildup during 
processing of a semiconductor workpiece. The present invention is directed to an apparatus 
and method for preventing the build up of by-product residues in semiconductor process 
chambers and in the vacuum conductance channels through which vacuum is applied to the 
process chamber. Semiconductor processing involves a number of different chemical and physical 
processes whereby minute integrated circuits are created on a substrate. The integrated 
circuits are constructed using multilayers of interrelated patterns of various materials, the 
layers being created by such processes as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor 
deposition (PVD), and epitaxial growth. Some layers are patterned using photoresist masks 
and wet and dry etching techniques. Patterns are created within layers by the implantation 
of dopants at particular locations. The substrate upon which the integrated circuit is created 
may be silicon, gallium arsenide, glass, or other appropriate material. Many of the processes carried out within semiconductor processing systems leave 
contaminant deposits on the walls of the process reactor chamber which accumulate and 
become the source of particulate matter harmful to the creation of a semiconductor device. 
As the geometries of semiconductor devices become ever so smaller, the ability to maintain 
the uniformity and accuracy of critical dimensions becomes strained. In this dimensional 
downsizing environment, the avoidance of contaminant particulate matter upon the surface 
of the semiconductor workpiece has become more critical. In addition to the problem of workpiece contamination presented by the process 
generation and deposition of particulate contaminants on the semiconductor chamber wall, 
those contaminant particles escaping the chamber through the vacuum conductance system 
tend to deposit and accumulate on the inner walls of the vacuum conduit channel between the  
 
chamber and vacuum pump. The build-up of these particulate deposits will inevitably reduce 
or clog the vacuum flow conductance from the chamber and increase the speed of the pump 
to attempt maintenance of the minimum pressure of the chamber. And further, the buildup 
on the valves in the conduit channel cause their manipulative shut-off function to be 
negatively affected to a point where their use in regulating vacuum in the chamber is 
unpredictable
