<ABSTRACT>
A method of driving for automatic machines, 
particularly for high-speed automatic machines consisting 

of a number of working units with alternate operation 
with synchronisation between the units, such as packing 

machines for cigarettes or similar, in which method the 
individual working units are driven by a single main 

electric motor (M) by means of associated transmission 
chains (3). According to the invention the variations of 

load on the main motor during the operating cycle of the 
machine are at least partially compensated for by the 

storage, in the form of reversible electrolytic energy, 
of the restored electrical energy of the main motor (M) 

in the phases of the machine cycle in which the resistant 
torque is inverted, and of the part of the electrical 

energy which is not supplied to the motor in the phases 
of the machine cycle in which the resistant torque is 

less than the mean value, and by the restoration of the 
said reversible electrolytic energy in the phases of the 

machine cycle in which the resistant torque exceeds the 
mean value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of driving for 
automatic machines, particularly for high-speed automatic 
machines consisting of a number of working units with 
alternate operation with synchronisation between the 
units, such as packing machines for cigarettes or 
similar, in which method the individual working units are 
driven by a single main electric motor by means of 
associated transmission chains. In automatic machines of the said type, two 
opposing requirements must be satisfied: on one hand, the 
least possible irregularity of motion is required; on the 
other hand, it must be possible to make emergency stops, 
in other words stops for any reason not explicitly 
provided for in the operating cycle of the machine, 
within a short time. To reduce the degree of irregularity of motion, 
a flywheel is used to compensate for the load variations 
present in the operating cycle of the machine by 
modifying its kinetic energy. In order to enable the 
machine to be stopped in a short time, however, it is 
necessary for the inertial mass in motion to be very 
small. The use of release devices to disengage the fly-wheel 
in the case of an emergency stop does not fully 
resolve the problem, since the activation of the release 
devices may be too slow for the rapidity of stopping 
which is required. The invention is therefore based on the problem 
of providing a method, and a device for its application 
to automatic machines, of the type described initially, 
with which it is possible to satisfy both opposing 
requirements in a simple and relatively economical way, 
ensuring the least possible irregularity of motion and 
the possibility of very rapid stopping in an emergency.  The invention resolves the above problem with a 
method of driving for automatic machines of the type 
described initially in which the variations of load on 
the main motor during the operating cycle of the machine 
are at least partially compensated for by the storage, in 
the form of reversible electrolytic energy, of: 
the electrical energy which the main motor restores 
in the phases of the machine cycle in which the resistant 
torque is inverted; the part of the electrical energy which is not 
supplied to the motor in the phases of the machine cycle 
in which the resistant torque is less than the mean 
value;  
and by the restoration of the said reversible 
electrolytic energy in the phases of the machine cycle in 
which the resistant torque exceeds the mean value. According to an improvement, it is also possible 
to prevent
