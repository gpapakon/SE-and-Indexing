<ABSTRACT>
2.1. It has not previously been possible to implement electrically conductive floor coatings based on (meth)acrylate, since the conductive fillers used, such as carbon black, graphite or surface-treated metal powders, hindered curing. It is therefore the intention, in accordance with the invention, to provide a polymerisable (meth)acrylate system which can be cured at ambient temperatures using a redox system and which meets the requirements of conductive floor coatings. 2.2. (Meth)acrylates which can be used for coating purposes and which may contain further components such as prepolymers, plasticisers, conventional additives, etc., can be cured with amorphous or spheroidal graphite and/or carbon fibres and/or finely divided metal, it also being possible for further fillers to be added. Amorphous natural graphite is particularly suitable, preferably in a particle size of from 20 to 1000  mu m. The coatings prepared in this way meet the requirements of DIN 51 953. 2.3. Conductive coatings, especially floor coatings.
