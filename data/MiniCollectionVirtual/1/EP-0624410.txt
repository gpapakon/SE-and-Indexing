<ABSTRACT>
The removal of organics and volatile metals from 
soils using thermal desorption comprises moving contaminated 

materials, positioned on a belt conveyor, through a 
chamber (32) under oxygen conditions, temperature conditions, 

and residence time effective to substantially avoid 
incineration of the contaminants, w
hile volatilizing the 
contaminants and producing a processed material that is 

substantially decontaminated, where the volatilized contaminants 
are carried from the chamber (32) by a transport 

gas which is passed through a packed tower (70) where 
quench/scrubbing liquid flows countercurrent to gas flow, 

for producing a substantially cleaned gas and a contaminated 
liquid concentrate. The gas may be passed through 

a further gas cleaning system (86) prior to discharge into 
the atmosphere, while the liquid concentrate is passed 

through a water treatment system (90) for producing substantially 
cleaned water which may be passed through an air 

cooler (92) and recycled back to cool the processed material. 
Steam from moist contaminated material can be used as 

a cocurrent transfer gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method 
for removing volatile and semi-volatile contaminants from 
solid materials and, more particularly, to an apparatus and 
method for thermal desorption of organics and volatile 
metals from soils to separate the contaminants from the 
soil. The contamination of soils, sludges, ashes, and 
other solids by organics and heavy metals is a significant 
environmental problem. Due to the large volumes involved 
and expensive disposal costs for these solids, there is a 
need to reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal. The contaminated soil may be treated by destruction 
of the contaminants, such as by incineration or by 
pyrolysis, or by separation of the contaminants from the 
soil, such as by thermal desorption. During incineration, 
the contaminants are heated under oxygen concentrations and 
residence time to a temperature effective to decompose the 
contaminants. During pyrolysis, the contaminants are 
heated in the absence of oxygen for a predetermined residence 
time to a temperature effective to decompose the 
contaminants. During thermal desorption, the contaminants 
are heated under oxygen concentrations and residence time 
to a temperature effective to avoid decomposition of the 
contaminants, thereby enabling the separation of the 
volatilized contaminants from the soil.  An invention involving thermal desorption, U.S. 
Patent Specification No. 5,188,041 (Noland et al.) uses 
heated oil, water, or eutectic salts passing through 
rotating hollow shafts and screw conveyor type flights to 
transport and heat contaminated soil in a vapor stripper 
under sealed conditions. Such a process would have a low 
heat transfer rates and be effective primarily for highly 
volatile contaminants. Moisture and contaminants in the 
material are stripped and carried cocurrently with the 
material by separate, heated, non-oxidative transport gas 
fed into the stripper from an outside heater. The contaminants 
are then burned in a burner or thermal destructor 
before being wet scrubbed or passed through activated 
carbon and vented. Condensation inside the vapor stripping 
conveyor is specifically avoided, and the non-oxidative 
transport gas, externally introduced, is blown directly 
onto the top of the contaminated material, which may 
enhance the escape of volatiles. Another example of thermal treatment of soil is 
disclosed in U.S Patent Specification No. 4,738,206 
(Noland). Contaminated soil is conveyed through a chamber 
by a screw conveyor with internally
