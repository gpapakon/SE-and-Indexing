<ABSTRACT>
Described is an apparatus for air conditioning a passenger
compartment of an automotive vehicle which achieves a quick warming-up

of the passenger compartment. In the air conditioning apparatus, in
addition to a coolant of a vehicular engine which is utilized as a heat

source of a heater core (16), a highly compressed refrigerant discharged
from a compressor (11) can be utilized as a heat source of a sub

condenser (24) which is disposed in an air passage of the air
conditioning apparatus, during the inside air warming up in the

passenger compartment. During the warming up operation, the refrigerant
discharged from the compressor (11) is circulated through a bypass line

bypassing a condenser (12) disposed at a front part of an engine
compartment and through the sub condenser (24) and an evaporator (15).

said auxiliary cooler form part of one refrigerant circuit using a high temperature and
high pressure refrigerant. Said auxiliary cooler is installed in an air duct at an
upstream side of said heater core and at a downstream side of said evaporator.
Within said one refrigerant circuit, a compressor is connected to a condenser, said
condenser is connected to a liquid tank, said liquid tank is connected to said auxiliary
cooler, said auxiliary cooler is connected to said evaporator and said evaporator is
connected to said compressor.Moreover, a previously proposed automotive air
conditioning system is constituted by an air heating
purpose coolant distribution line utilizing a vehicular
engine coolant of a vehicular engine which is a driving
source (a prime mover) of the vehicle as a heat source and
by an air cooling purpose refrigerant distribution line
utilizing a highly pressurized refrigerant discharged from
a compressor as another heat source. For example, the previously proposed vehicular air
conditioning system is constituted by a) the coolant
temperature distribution line having an engine jacket, an
electromagnetic valve, a piping member for performing a
heat exchange between a supplied engine coolant and an
introduced air (air introduced for the air conditioning
purpose) to heat the introduced air at a heater core and
for returning the heat exchanged coolant to the engine
jacket and by b) the refrigerant distribution line having
a compressor,
