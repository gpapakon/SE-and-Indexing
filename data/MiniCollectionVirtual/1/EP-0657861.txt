<ABSTRACT>
A method of driving a surface discharge plasma 
display panel has a reset step of applying a pulse of a 

first voltage to paired first and second electrodes (X, 
Yi), a write step of applying a pulse of a second 

voltage to second and third electrodes (Yi, Aj) 
corresponding to cells (10) to be turned ON, and a 

sustain discharge step of applying an AC pulse of a 
fourth voltage to the paired first and second 

electrodes (X, Yi). The pulse of the first voltage is 
so set that it is higher than a first discharge start 

voltage, a third voltage caused by the discharge is 
higher than the first discharge start voltage, and the 

first, second, and third electrodes (X, Yi, Aj) have 
the same potential after the application of the pulse of 

the first voltage. Therefore, an address discharge of 
the surface discharge plasma display panel can be caused 

by a wide range of voltages, and display quality of the 
panel can be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and
apparatus for driving surface discharge plasma display
panels.Flat display panels such as three-electrode
surface-discharge alternating-current plasma display
panels (AC PDPs) may be required to have large screens,
large capacity, and the ability to display full-colour
images. In particular, AC PDPs may be required to
provide more display lines and intensity levels and to
be capable of rewriting their screens stably without
decreasing the luminance of the screens.In a previously-considered driving method
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 4-195188 and Japanese Patent Application
No. 4-340498, 256 shades of grey are realized by
dividing a frame into eight sub-fields. In such a
driving method, two or three discharges should be
carried out during the reset period, so that wall
charges become uniformly distributed, with a view to
securing stable operation. However, such discharge can
produce light even at parts of the panel which are
supposed to be displaying black, and thus the contrast
of the PDP can deteriorate.It is desirable to provide a method and an
apparatus for driving a surface discharge plasma
display panel with a satisfactorily wide range of
operating potentials for causing address discharge, so
as to improve the display quality of the panel.
Further, it is desirable to provide a method and an
apparatus for driving a surface discharge plasma
display panel so that it displays black with
satisfactorily low luminance, thereby improving the
display quality of the panel.Consideration has been given to a line-by-line
self-erase addressing method for driving a PDP, in
which method wall charges (which are charges 
accumulated on the surface of a wall of a PDP) remain
during a reset period, and have the effect of
decreasing an address discharge. Fluctuations in such
remanent wall charges, however, may narrow the range of
operating potential available to provide stable
operation of the PDP under various conditions. Such
fluctuations can also vary the optimum values of the
operating potentials, and thereby destabilize the
operation of the PDP or lower the display quality
thereof.EP-A-0549275 discloses another method of driving a
surface discharge plasma display panel that has first
and second substrates, arranged so that respective main
surfaces thereof face one another with a discharge
space therebetween containing a discharge gas, first
elongate electrodes extending parallel to one another
and arranged on the said first substrate
