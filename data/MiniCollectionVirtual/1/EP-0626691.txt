<ABSTRACT>
A storage package (10) for an article (12) such as a 
compact disc and a booklet (14) includes a cover (20) 

comprising a pair of panels (22,24) secured together and 
movable between a closed storage orientation wherein the 

panels are substantially overlying with at least an 
article (12) and a booklet (14) supported by the article 

disposed intermediate the pair of panels, and an open use 
orientation (Fig. 2) wherein the panels are not 

substantially overlying and the article and booklet are 
accessible. A fixed base (30) formed of plastic and 

mounted on one of the panels (24), defines a cavity (32) 
with a bottom face (34), and an open top face (36). A 

floating holder (40) formed of rigid plastic is disposed 
within the cavity (32) intermediate the faces (34,36) for 

receiving and maintaining thereon the article and 
booklet, the holder being movable between a plurality of 

positions variably spaced above the cavity bottom face 
(34). Spring means (50) secured to either the base (30) 

or the holder (40) biases the holder above the cavity 
bottom face, thereby to accommodate booklets (14) of 

varying thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a storage 
package for an article such as a recording medium, and 
more particularly to such a storage package which can 
accommodate a booklet as well. It is known to provide a storage package for 
an article, in the form of a pair of panels secured 
together by a spine and movable between a closed 
storage orientation wherein the panels are 
substantially overlying with the article disposed 
intermediate the pair of panels, and an open use 
orientation wherein the panels are not substantially 
overlying and the article is accessible. Typically, a 
holder is mounted on one of the panels in order to 
receive and maintain thereon the article. It is frequently desirable to include within a 
storage package a multipage booklet as well as the 
article. Where the article is a recording medium, the 
booklet may be associated with the article and 
describe the performer, the performance, or provide 
other related printed material. Accordingly, the 
other panel (that is, the panel on which the holder is 
not mounted) often includes a pocket or half-pocket  
 
configured and dimensioned to receive the booklet, or 
defines by means of vertically extending side tabs a 
substantially open compartment from which the 
recording medium is excluded and which is suitable for 
releasably receiving and maintaining the booklet. 
These arrangements have not proven to be entirely 
satisfactory, as they require that the booklet be 
placed with some degree of care within the pocket, 
half-pocket or compartment. On the other hand, if the booklet is simply 
placed between the upper face of the holder and the 
other panel (that is, the panel which does not mount 
the holder), then when the panels are put into the 
closed storage orientation, there will be a bulging of 
the other panel unless suitable space has been 
provided between the two panels, and more particularly 
between the upper surface of the recording medium on 
the holder and the other panel). While the holder may 
define a cavity of sufficient depth to receive both 
the article and the booklet thereabove so that the 
booklet does not extend above the upper face of the 
cavity and therefore does not cause the panels to 
bulge when they are in the closed storage orientation, 
this solution presents its own unique problems. For example, in order to easily remove a 
compact disk from a holder, the edge of the compact 
disk must be readily accessible to the fingertips of  
 
the person attempting to remove it from the holder.
