<CLAIMS>
Centrifugal pump of the axial type for the
conveyance of liquids containing fibrous constituents,

with a plurality of guide blades (3) arranged after a

rotor (4) in the direction of flow and extending between
an outer casing (1) and an inner casing (2), drive

elements being arranged within the inner casing (2) for
the rotor (4), and the guide blades (3) being inclined

with their onflow edges (6) forwards in the direction of
flow, characterized in that a stripping and/or cutting

device (5) is arranged opposite the inner casing (2) on
the rotor hub (7) between the rotor (4) and the onflow

edges (6) and at an axial distance from the rotor,
fibrous constituents, which adhere to the onflow edges

(6) of the guide blades (3) and which slide along these
to the inner casing (2), being removed from the onflow

edges (6) of the guide blades (3) in the region of the
inner casing (2) by the stripping and/or cutting device

(5) which is located only in the hub region.
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the onflow edges (6) are inclined in the

circumferential direction counter to the direction of
rotation of the rotor (4).
Centrifugal pump according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, in meridional contour, the onflow edges are

inclined forwards counter to the direction of flow.
Centrifugal pump according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the guide blades (3.1) are fastened

partially only to the outer casing (1).
Centrifugal pump according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that bosses mounted on the hub form

the stripping and/or cutting device (5).
