<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stackable insertable box 
having an inwards inclined wall and a cover fitting 

thereto, characterised in that both the cover (3) and 
the box (1) comprise rim portions (4) and (5) respectively 

extending respectively with respect to the cover 
(3) and the box (1) in a manner such as to coincide with 

or such as to be parallel to the generatrix of a cylinder, 
respectively of a parallelepiped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stackable 
insertable box having an inwards inclined wall and 
a cover fitting thereto. Boxes of the intended type are known in 
many embodiments and are usually made of a readily 
deformable plastic material so that the cover can be 
snapped easily onto the box and can be removed therefrom 
also easily by deforming the cover slightly locally. The protection of such boxes against 
fraudulent opening involves problems which could not 
always be solved in the most efficient way. This is so 
for the problems arising during the production as well 
as for the problems in the selling and consumer phase. An object of the invention is therefore to 
provide a stackable and insertable box which allows the 
box, whose walls show a slightly inwards inclined wall 
in view of the required possibility to insert these 
boxes into one another, with a cover which may be provided 
with an adhesive tape mutually connecting the box 
and cover so that, if necessary, a fraudulent access 
into the interior of the box may be established. In order to enable this in an original and 
technically reliable way, both the cover and the box 
comprise rim portions extending respectively with 
respect to the cover and the box in a manner such as to 
coincide with or such as to be parallel to the generatrix 
of a cylinder, respectively a parallelepiped. Still according to the invention, said 
wall of the box comprises an extended portion permitting  
 
said cover to be snapped thereon, said cover showing to 
this end a reversed V profile. Other details and advantages of the invention 
will become apparent from the following description 
of a stackable and insertable box according to the 
invention. This description is only given by way of 
example and does not limit the invention. The reference 
numerals relate to the figures annexed hereto. Figure 1 shows according to a cross-section 
and on an enlarged scale the connection between 
cover and box. Figure 2 shows partially and on another 
scale the walls of two stacked pots. Figure 3 shows on the same scale as figure 
2 and also partially the edge of two stacked covers. In figure 2, the inclined wall of the 
conical box is indicated with reference 1. Onto this 
box, more particularly onto the extended portion 2 
thereof which is situated in the use position at the 
top, a cover 3 may be snapped. This extended portion 2 of the wall 1 
comprises means for enabling the cover 3 to be snapped 
onto the extended portion 2 of the box. These means may 
consist
