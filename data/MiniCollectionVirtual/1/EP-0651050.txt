<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a particulate agglomerate 
detergent component comprising a salt and a binder, where 
said binder is applied in fluid form and comprises anionic 
surfactant and alkali metal silicate. Another aspect of 
the invention relates to a process for making particulate 
agglomerate detergent components. In recent years there has been a trend towards making 
granular detergents having a higher bulk density than 
before. Various techniques of making dense granular 
detergents, and of processing low density granular 
detergents in such a way that the bulk density is 
increased, have been described. One example of a suitable 
technique for making dense granular detergents is known as 
"agglomeration". This term herein describes any process in 
which small particles of the components are processed in 
such a way that they are built-up (or "agglomerated") to 
form suitable granular components. The agglomerate particle should show acceptable physical 
characteristics, such as acceptable hardness and flow  
 
properties. It should be possible to make the agglomerate 
via a manufacturing process which is both efficient and 
versatile. US 5 080 848, published on 14th January, 1992 describes a 
process for making surfactant granules typically having an 
anionic surfactant activity of 50% to 75% (see examples 1 
to 8). The process involves chilling and granulating a 
viscous high active surfactant paste. The granulation may 
be performed with the aid of some detergency builders (see 
examples 3 and 4), but the emphasis is on reducing the 
temperature in order to initiate granulation. EP 0 508 543, published on 14th October, 1992 discloses 
methods of chemically conditioning high active surfactant 
pastes in order to achieve high active detergent granules. 
Silicates are generally disclosed as useful conditioning 
agents. Conditioning of a paste may be achieved by, for 
example, increasing paste viscosity and/or drying. When incorporated into agglomerate particles, certain 
anionic surfactants, particularly the alkyl ethoxysulfate 
surfactants, can tend to make the particles sticky, causing 
poor flow characteristics, and caking of the product. The 
inclusion of these anionic surfactants can also tend to 
result in particles which are soft and insufficiently 
robust to break up of the particle. It has now been surprisingly found that detergent particles 
having good hardness and flow properties can be made by 
agglomerating salts using a fluid binder containing a high 
active solution of
