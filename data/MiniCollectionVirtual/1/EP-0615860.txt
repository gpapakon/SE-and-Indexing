<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a laser imageable donor material that is capable 
of transferring pigment to a receiver, such as plain paper, polymeric film, metal 

and the like. The donor material is composed of at least a transparent film, an 
overlying layer of vapor coated black aluminum, and a dye coating or pigment 

coating dispersed on top of the black aluminum. A material which generates gas 

when irradiated may also be present as a separate layer under or in the dye or 
pigment layer and above the black aluminum layer. The construction can be 

addressed with diode lasers and diode-pumped solid state lasers. 
The invention can be used to produce large format digital halftone color 
proofs using high power air-cooled diode-pumped Nd:YAG and Nd:YLF lasers. 

Other materials could be transferred from the donor sheet in this process as 
well as the colorant (dye or pigment) layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
Laser propulsive transfer imaging has been studied for over 20 years.
Work in this field was largely based on the use of high power flashlamp water-cooled
Nd:YAG lasers capable of producing more than 5 W of power.
Recently, diode-pumped solid state lasers have become available in the 0.2 to 4
W range. This laser technology would make laser propulsive transfer imaging
more commercially feasible since diode-pumped lasers are compact, air-cooled,
and relatively maintenance-free.The process in which the article of the invention is used provides a
donor element which has a laser propulsive transfer material, an absorber
component and the material to be transferred, the latter two of which may be
incorporated into a single or multilayer coating that is applied to a transparent
substrate such as polyester. This donor sheet is then placed in contact with a
receiver substrate (plain paper, aluminum, coated polyester, etc.) and imaged
(irradiated from the back or front) with the laser. Material is transferred from
the donor to the receptor only in those locations where laser heating has
occurred. It is believed that the rapid absorption of laser energy produces a
rapid expansion or devolution of gases in the donor sheet from thermal
expansion and/or decomposition, and this expansion induces a rapid evolution
of gas which has been compared to a shock wave that propels the transfer
material from the donor to the receptor. Since the material is heated
adiabatically, the exposure energy required is reduced to less than 0.2 J/cm2.
The transfer process is fast, requiring pixel dwell times of only a few 100 ns.
This means that A3 size format images can be produced in less than 2 minutes
using a 4 W laser. In the past, carbon black/nitrocellulose coatings were used to transfer
crosslinkable resins to aluminum printing plates and to make films and black
and white proofs. More recently, a decomposable polymer was disclosed in
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,156,938 and 5, 171,650 which could be used to transfer
pigment for color proofing applications. These patents describe the use of
Cyasorb 165 IR dye to absorb the laser power. This IR dye has a low
absorptivity in the visible region, thus preventing excessive visible staining of
the pigment. This IR (Infra-Red) dye was also used as an absorber in glycidyl
azide polymer (GAP) imaging materials described in U.S. Patent 5,278,023,
which corresponds to EP-A-599 689, a document according to
Article 54(3) EPC

substrate, a black aluminum and/or black tin layer on

one surface of said substrate, a gas generating
polymer layer having a thermally available nitrogen

content of greater than about 10 weight percent over

wavelength of the imaging radiation and the reflected

light is less than 20% of the incident light on the
surface of the black aluminum and/or black tin layer,

refers to the nitrogen content of a material which

upon exposure to heat generates or liberates nitrogen
(N
