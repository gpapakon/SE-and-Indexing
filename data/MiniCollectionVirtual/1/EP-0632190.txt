An internal-combustion engine with two rows of cylinders, a cooling-water pump
arranged at the front end of a cylinder block (3) of one row of cylinders, a connecting

duct (22) leading below a longitudinal axis (
A
) of the crankshaft from the pump to the
other row of cylinders, and cooling-water jackets (10) and cylinder heads (7) traversed in

transverse flow, wherein cooling water flowing away from the cylinder rows is received
by a collecting duct arranged above the longitudinal axis (
A
), and a supply duct (16) for
cooling water extending below and parallel to the longitudinal axis (
A
) is arranged in a
lower wall (18, 19) of the crankcase (1, 2) or cylinder housing (3, 4) of each cylinder row

(1, 2), 
characterized in that
 removal ducts (30) are integrated in an upper wall (28, 29)
of the crankcase (1, 2) or cylinder housing (3, 4) in the same way that the supply ducts

are integrated in a lower wall of each cylinder row, and the supply and removal ducts are
arranged adjacent to a separation plane (
T-T
) between cylinder blocks (3, 4) and cylinder
heads (7) in the immediately vicinity of the combustion chambers.
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the removal
ducts (30) are connected to one another by way of a collecting duct constructed in the

form of a transverse duct (31) and arranged in the upper wall (28, 29) adjacent to a front
end (12) of the internal-combustion engine.
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 an entry
opening (15) of a supply duct (16) is arranged in a depression (13) - receiving the cooling-water

pump - in one cylinder block (3).
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the connecting
duct (22) is arranged extending in part in an oil sump (26) of the internal-combustion

engine.
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each supply
duct (16) provided with first and second connexions (20 and 21 respectively) is connected

to the cooling jacket (10) and the cylinder head (7) respectively.
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the supply
ducts (16), the removal ducts (30), the transverse duct (31) and in part the connecting

duct (22) are integrally cast in the walls (18, 19, 28, 29). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claims 6 and 4, 
characterized in that
 the
portion (23) extending in the oil sump (26) is constructed as a heat-exchanger pipe (24)

provided with cooling ribs (25) on its outer jacket.
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the transverse
duct (31) is arranged adjacent to the front end (12) carrying the cooling-water

pump.
