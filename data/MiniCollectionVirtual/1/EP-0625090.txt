<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a waterproof article of footwear and method of making the same, the article comprising an upper portion having integrally moulded sides and bottom and a sole portion attached to said upper portion. The shaping of the upper and sole portions is complementary to provide a unitary fit therebetween and includes bottom and side contouring to provide support for preselected areas of the foot. The contouring of the upper and sole portions of the article results in a footwear product which is both waterproof and comfortable without the necessity of adding a shaped foot insert piece to the moulded product to provide foot support.

 CONTOURED MOULDED FOOTWEAR AND METHOD OF MAKING SAMEField of the Invention:The invention relates to the manufacture of moulded footwear in particular to waterproof footwear of which the upper portion and bottom thereof, upon which the foot rests, are integrally moulded.Background of the Invention;Conventional injection moulding processes are well- known and are commonly used to manufacture waterproof footwear such as rubber boots comprising a sole portion and an upper portion attached thereto. In the past, such manufacturing processes have produced only waterproof footwear comprising upper parts with flat insoles (i.e. the bottom insoles that portion upon which the foot rests) which are then attached, or moulded, to a sole component. Typically, the articles of footwear produced by such processes are sometimes supplemented with an added contoured foot support which is inserted into the footwear article after the moulding process has been completed to render the article more comfortable in use. This added step increases the time and cost associated with the manufacturing process and is prone to produce unsatisfactory results from the customers perspective caused by a tendency for the dislodging or movement of such inserts, over time, as the article is worn.Thus, there is need in the marketplace for comfortable waterproof footwear comprising integrally moulded uppers and soles for supporting the foot.Summary of the Invention;The invention provides a waterproof article of footwear comprising an upper portion having integrally 

 moulded sides and bottom and a sole portion attached to the upper portion. The shaping of the upper and sole portions is complementary to provide a unitary fit therebetween and the sloping of the upper portion includes bottom and side contouring to provide support for preselected areas of the foot.The invention further provides a method for making the aforesaid article of footwear whereby side and bottom elements are integrally moulded using a thermoplastic material to form an upper portion, a sole portion is moulded and the two portions are attached together. The moulding of the upper and sole portions is such that the shaping of the same is as described above. Preferably, but not necessarily, the said moulding is by means of injection moulding whereby the upper and sole portions are produced one following the other such that the portions become moulded together.Brief Description of the Drawings;The subject invention will now be described in the following with reference to the

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A waterproof article of footwear comprising:
(a) an upper portion comprising integrally moulded sides and bottom; and,
(b) a sole portion attached to said upper portion; whereby the shaping of said upper and sole portions is complementary to provide a unitary fit therebetween and the shaping of said upper includes bottom and side contouring to provide support for preselected areas of the foot.
2. A waterproof article of footwear according to claim 1 wherein said sole portion includes within the area between the heel and arch locations thereof a rigid support bar.
3. A waterproof article of footwear according to claim 2 wherein said upper and sole portions are of a thermoplastic material, the rigidity of the same comprising the sole portion being greater than that comprising the upper portion.
4. A method for making a waterproof article of footwear comprising:
(a) integrally moulding side and bottom elements of an article of footwear using a thermoplastic material to form an upper portion of said article;
(b) moulding a sole portion of said article;
(c) attaching said upper and sole portions; whereby the shaping of said upper and sole portions is complementary to provide a unitary fit therebetween and the upper portion includes bottom and side contouring to provide support for preselected areas of the foot. 


5. A method according to claim 4 whereby said upper and sole portions are moulded by means of injection moulding, one following the other, in selected order, such that the portions become moulded together.
