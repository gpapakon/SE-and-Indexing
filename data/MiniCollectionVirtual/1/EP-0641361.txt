<ABSTRACT>
A fluoroelastomer composition free of metal or metal containing compounds, such as metal, metal alloys, metal salts or metal oxide suitable for the upper layer of a fuser roll which does not require the use of mercapto functional active release agents to prevent offset is provided. The fluoroelastomer compositions contain at least 23.4 mole percent hexafluoropropylene. They can be cured by electron beam treatment, fugitive base treatment or by the use of blocked/hindered bases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to metal oxide free
fluoroelastomer compositions and to a fusing member having an
outer layer of the fluoroelastomer for applying heat and
pressure to fix toner particles to recording paper.A fuser roll is a roller designed to apply direct
heat and pressure to a toner image. The fluoroelastomer
surface permits toner to be fixed to the recording paper
without adhering to the roller surface and can withstand
continuous exposure to high temperatures, silicone oils,
toners, toner additives and paper product residue without
unacceptable physical degradation.In general, when forming images by xerographic
processes, an image formed of a heat fusible toner powder is
selectively disposed on a web-like surface of a recording
medium, such as paper, by electrostatic forces. Toner powders
are commonly formed of a mixture of thermoplastic and/or
thermosetting resin carriers and additives such as amorphous
carbon and magnetic particles. They are conventionally fixed
to the recording paper by direct contact with a fuser roll
which applies pressure and heat at temperatures between about
200 to 400Â°F.The fusing process is conventionally accomplished by
feeding a recording medium having the toner image thereon
between the nip where two mated rollers meet. One or both of
the rollers are heated, typically by an internal heat source
within the roller, so that the surface temperature of the
roller will be above the softening point of the resinous
carrier of the toner.The recording medium with the toner image thereon is
fed between the two rollers which press towards each other to
apply direct heat and pressure to the toner image. The amount
of pressure and the length of time that the toner is heated
determines the degree of fusing. The actual temperature range
suitable for fixing toner images to recording paper is referred 
to as the "fusing window". The fusing window, TW can be
defined by the formula:
TW = TOFF - TMIN
wherein TOFF is the Hot Offset temperature and TMIN is the
minimum fusing temperature. Hot Offset temperature is the
temperature at which the cohesive forces within the molten
toner layer are less than the adhesive forces between the toner
and roll surface so that toner adheres to the fuser roll. TMIN
is the minimum temperature at which toner can be acceptably
fixed to the recording paper. This temperature range is
dependent on the raw materials, type of toner, release agents
and the pressure applied by the roller. It is important that
the toner is fixed without "offset"
