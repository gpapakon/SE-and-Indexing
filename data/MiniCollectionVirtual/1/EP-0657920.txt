<ABSTRACT>
An automatic wafer etching apparatus including a first 
elevator (33) and a second 

elevator (34) each having a top surface whose vertical 
cross-section is circularly 

concaved having a curvature equal to that of the 
wafers and adapted to 

reciprocate vertically such that the top surface can 
pass through the etching 

drum (31), and an etching drum having a main housing 
consisting of a pair of vertical 

parallel side plates opposing each other, a horizontal shaft integral with the 
main housing side plates; a plurality of rollers borne between the main housing 

side plates in a manner such that they are freely rotatory; the rollers having 
annular grooves in their surfaces to receive edges of wafers in a manner such 

that the wafers are supported vertically at suitable intervals in a horizontal 
row; small-diameter gears locked at those ends of the rollers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic wafer etching method and an 
apparatus therefor, adopted in the field of semiconductor wafer manufacturing, 
and in particular the invention concerns such a method and an apparatus wherein 
a plurality of wafers contained in a basket are automatically transferred to 
another container all at a time to thereby attain completely automatic etching 
operation. A semiconductor wafer to be made into substrates for semiconductor electronic 
devices is produced in the following manner: a single crystal ingot of a 
semiconductor material such as silicon is sliced into thin plates by cutting it 
in a direction substantially normal to the axis of the ingot; then, the faces of 
the plates are lapped, etched, annealed and polished and eventually the plates 
are rendered thin round disks having a mirror face on one side of them. After the lapping, the wafers are contained in a wafer basket which carries them 
to a location where etching is conducted, and there the wafers are transferred 
from the basket to an etching drum, and the etching drum together with the 
wafers is submerged into an etchant so that the surfaces of the wafers are 
wetted and etched by the etchant, whereby the surface irregularities and the 
lapping abrasive powder rubbed into the surfaces of the wafers, which is caused  
 
during the surface lapping, are removed. Although the etching operation itself is conducted automatically, the transfer 
operation of the wafers from the lapping location to the etching location, and 
that from the etching location to the annealing and polishing locations were not 
automatic, nor were they conducted in an in-line manner. Since the transportion of wafers from one location to another, or from one 
container to another was not automatic, the overall etching operation required 
much time and a constant attention of a human operator. Also, when the wafers 
were brought to a container by a transfer means, the transfer means by itself 
inserts the wafers into the wafer racks of the container and lets the wafers 
fall onto the racks so that the wafers are liable to chip as their edges collide 
with the frames of the wafer racks. Thus, it has been desired that the series of operations in the etching apparatus 
are all conducted automatically on end, and that in a manner such that the 
wafers are not allowed to hit upon any part of the containers. To realize this 
it was necessary to automatize the wafer transportion operations, and the wafers 
ought to be transferred from

<CLAIMS>
An automatic wafer etching apparatus, having a plurality of tanks of which 
one contains an etchant and others pure water, a first wafer container for 

containing a number of wafers to steep them in pure water contained in said 
pure water tanks, a second wafer container for containing as many wafers as 

said first wafer container to steep the wafers in the etchant in said etchant 
tank, said automatic wafer etching apparatus being characterized by further 

including an automatic wafer transfer mechanism for transferring said wafers 
from said first wafer container to said second wafer container, and vice versa, 

within pure water. 
The automatic wafer transfer mechanism as claimed in Claim 1 comprising: a 
first elevator means having a top surface whose vertical cross-section is 

circularly concaved having a curvature equal to that of the wafers and adapted 
to reciprocate vertically such that said top surface can pass through a wafer 

container; a second elevator means having a top surface whose vertical cross-section 
is circularly concaved having a curvature equal to that of the wafers 

and adapted to reciprocate vertically such that said top surface can pass 
through a wafer container; and a transfer means for picking up the wafers from 

the top surface of said first elevator means as the wafers are raised in the 
wafer container to a predetermined height by elevation of said first elevator 

means and transferring and placing the wafers onto the top surface of said 
second elevator means when this elevator means has risen to a predetermined 

height. 
The automatic wafer transfer mechanism as claimed in Claim 2 wherein said 
first wafer container is a wafer basket, and said second wafer container is an 

 
etching drum which comprises: a main housing consisting of a pair of vertical 

parallel side plates opposing each other; a horizontal shaft means integral 
with said main housing side plates; a plurality of rollers borne between said 

main housing side plates in a manner such that they are freely rotatory; said 
rollers having annular grooves in their surfaces to receive edges of wafers in 

a manner such that the wafers are supported vertically at suitable intervals in 
a horizontal row; small-diameter gears locked at those ends of said rollers 

which extend beyond one of the main housing side plates; a movable housing 
having a pair of vertical parallel side plates opposing each other and borne by 

said rotary shaft in a manner such that said movable housing can rotate freely 
about this shaft; a set bar borne between said side plates of the movable 

housing in a manner such that said set bar is freely rotatory about its center 
line; a small-diameter gear locked about that end of said set bar which extends 

beyond said movable housing; and a large-diameter gear which is borne about 
said rotary shaft and meshes with said small-diameter gears.
