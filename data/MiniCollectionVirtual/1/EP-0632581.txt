<ABSTRACT>
In a fully differential amplifier so configured that an operating 
point potential of positive and negative output terminals of a differential 

amplifier having an active load is set by a common-mode feedback circuit, 
the common-mode feedback circuit includes a first differential pair 

receiving a reference potential given from an external and a positive 
output potential of the differential amplifier, a second differential pair 

receiving the reference potential and a negative output potential of the 
differential amplifier, and a sum current feedback means for giving a sum 

current of output currents of the first and second differential pairs to a 
bias current for the active load of the differential amplifier. With this 

arrangement, a difference between a common-mode output potential of 
the differential amplifier and the reference potential is fed back to the 

differential amplifier in the form of the sum current, so as to control to 
equalize the common-mode output potential of the differential amplifier 

with the reference potential.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fully differential amplifier, and
more specifically to a fully differential amplifier so configured that an
operating point potential of positive and negative output terminals of a
differential amplifier having an active load is controlled by a common-mode
feedback circuit.A common-mode feedback circuit incorporated in a fully
differential amplifier is ordinarily provided to set an operating potential
of inverted and non-inverted output terminals of the fully differential
amplifier. An example of the common-mode feedback circuit is described
in Roubik Gregorian et al "ANALOG MOS INTEGRATED CIRCUITS
FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING", Pages 254-256, A Wiley-Interscience
Publication, 1986, the content of which is incorporated by reference in its
entirety into this specification. However, this common-mode feedback
circuit has only a narrow output operating range, because a number of
transistors are series-connected between a positive voltage supply line and
a negative voltage supply line. In addition, in order to freely set an
output voltage, it is necessary to adjust the area of various circuit 
elements. In conclusion, this common-mode feedback circuit was very
complicated in design.In order to improve the above mentioned common-mode feedback
circuit, it has been considered to detect a neutral point (common-mode
output potential) between a positive output terminal and a negative output
terminal of the fully differential amplifier, to compare the detected
common-mode output potential with a reference potential, and to feed
back the result of comparison to a control electrode of a transistor which
constitutes an active load for the fully differential amplifier, for the
purpose of equalizing the common-mode output potential with the
reference potential. However, in a cascaded type of fully differential
amplifier, if a resistor is directly connected to the output terminal so that
a potential on the neutral point is detected by use of a resistor voltage
division, a gain lowers, and therefore, an advantage of the cascaded type
cannot be exerted.Under this circumstance, it has been proposed to interpose a high
impedance buffer and to detect the common-mode output potential from
an output of the high impedance buffer by means of a voltage division
resistor or a current addition. One typical example of this type fully
differential amplifier will be described with reference to Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. JP-A-01-126811, which disclose the
