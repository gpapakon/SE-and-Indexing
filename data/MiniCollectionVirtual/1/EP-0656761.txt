<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for measuring a patient's psychotherapy progress is provided. Initial patient mental health is measured by administering a questionnaire measuring three psychological variables. The three psychological variable measures are combined into a mental health index (69). Following a number of sessions of psychotherapy, the patient's subsequent psychological condition is again measured using the three psychological variables. Patient session records (42) are stored in a large database (20). Patient progress can thus be compared versus patient initial psychlological condition, typical patient outcomes as stored in the database (20), and patient improvement as a function of a number of sessions of psychotherapy can be determined. The system further provides a case manager with a measure of the effectiveness of continued psychotherapy sessions, and a basis of comparison of various psychotherapy providers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING PSYCHOTHERAPY OUTCOMESBackground Of The InventionThis invention relates to psychotherapy. More particularly, this invention relates to a system for measuring and quantifying a patient's psychological condition and the progress, stasis, or retrogression thereof, and for administering pyschotherapy based on such measurements.Costs in the health care field have grown at an alarming rate. Efforts to contain these costs through devices such as DRGs have slowed the growth of inpatient care, but total health care costs continue to escalate as the inpatient cost savings have shifted into expenditures for outpatient treatment. Meanwhile, the cost of mental health treatment has greatly outpaced general health care costs. Prior cost containment efforts have focused on inpatient costs. A case management approach has been applied to cost containment efforts. Often, much of a company's mental health costs are for inpatient treatment. However, recent trends are forcing a shift toward outpatient care. Furthermore, simply decreasing the amount of mental health coverage is not an attractive alternative, since poorly treated employees typically work less effectively and have increased absenteeism. Moreover, the families of such employees typically use the general health care system at an increased rate. 

 Mental health care may be characterized by two characteristics of overriding importance: the cost of the care, and the results or benefits of the care. Although cost is easily measured, treatment outcomes and the benefits of mental health care have been difficult if not impossible to measure. Accordingly, efforts to improve the system for delivering mental health care have focused on cost, the only measured variable in the system. Since the cost parameter can be measured, systems which minimize cost tend to be rewarded without regard to the unknown effect of cost minimizing measures on patient care. Efforts to control costs include restricting access to mental health care; a case manager may encourage providers to deny care altogether or to terminate care as early as possible. However, without a reasonably accurate and objective method of evaluating cases, a case manager or other interested person is unable to rationally allocate the limited resources for psychotherapy among those who demand it. For instance, extensive resources may be allocated to patients who would show limited or no improvement even after extended treatment, while resources may be denied to patients who would show
