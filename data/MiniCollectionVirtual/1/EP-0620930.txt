<ABSTRACT>
The invention permits the production of bubble-free solder resist coatings on circuit boards with high and closely spaced conductor tracks by using a solvent-free photopolymeric lacquer which is heated to pouring consistency by passage over a heated roller with a doctor blade and under an infrared lamp and then poured in the form of a curtain over the cooled circuit boards.

<CLAIMS>
A method of coating printed circuit boards with photopolymerizable lacquers in the 
curtain-casting process, 
characterized in that
 a lacquer system with a high proportion 
of solids of from 80 to 100% by weight is removed by means of a heated roller (3) from 

a tempered trough (2) at 40 to 60°C and is supplied to a doctor blade (4) heated to 60 
to 90°C, is made to flow by infrared radiators, and is then poured at a viscosity of 100 

to 500 mPa·s onto printed circuit boards cooled from -20 to +25°C. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 photopolymerizable lacquers 
with a viscosity of 10,000 to 150,000 mPa·s are introduced at 20°C, and preferably 

contain 0 to 10% by weight, and at most 50% by weight, of fillers, relative to the resin 
system. 
A method according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 printed circuit boards 
are moved through under the lacquer curtain by a coating slide at a speed of 250 to 

300 m/min in order to obtain lacquer coatings in the range of 5 to 30 µm. 
A method according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the excess lacquer is 
cooled down to a method temperature of 30 to 50°C by a cooling roller (12). 
A device for coating printed circuit boards with photopolymerizable lacquers in the 
curtain-casting process, 
characterized in that
 in a coating plant for the curtain-casting 
process, above the conveyor belt for the printed circuit boards (7), a heatable roller (3) 

is arranged in a channel-shaped heatable trough (2), [and] a heatable doctor blade (4) is 

mounted on the roller (3), above which infrared radiators (5) are arranged parallel to 
the doctor blade (4). 
A device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 at least one additional wiper 
blade (15) of adjustable width is mounted on the heatable roller (3). 
A device according to Claims 5 and 6, 
characterized in that
 a cooling reservoir (6) is 
arranged upstream of the conveyor belt for the printed circuit boards (7). 
A device according to Claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that
 at least one infrared radiator 
(10) is installed vertically at the end of the heatable doctor blade (4).  

 
A device according to Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that
 a coolable storage tank (8) 
and a metering device (9) are arranged upstream of the heatable trough (2). 
A device according to Claims 5 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the infrared radiators (5, 
10) can be operated in the temperature range of 160 to 220°C, and a variable radiator 

distance is made possible by suitable retaining means. 
A device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a coating slide comprising 
vacuum suckers which are each mounted on two retaining means provided with 

a toggle joint and which in turn are guided on rails installed outside the lacquer curtain.
