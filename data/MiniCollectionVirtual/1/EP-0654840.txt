<ABSTRACT>
A high Q microwave filter is disclosed. Coupling bar 
structures (16, 17) are included in a cylindrical resonator 

(10), extending substantially the entire length of the resonator 
(10) for coupling orthogonal modes (1, 2). Fine tuning may be 

provided by inserting tuning screws (12, 13) into the cylindrical 
resonator (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microwave filter comprising a cylindrical resonator 
coupled to receive an electromagnetic wave having first and second modes of electromagnetic 
radiation. In more general terms, the present invention relates to the microwave communications 
field and, in particular, a cylindrical waveguide resonator is described having increased bandwith 
and minimal asymmetry. In direct broadcast microwave systems, such as DBS and BSD, final frequency 
filtering is necessary at the KU band. These systems are extremely sensitive to signal losses which 
occur in the filtering sections. In an attempt to increase the bandwith in a microwave filter, the 
passband filter response can become asymmetric, further increasing the losses within the final 
signal filtering stage. In the cylindrical waveguide resonator art, high Q filters are produced at the KU 
band opering in the TE₁₁₃ electromagnetic propagation mode. In the past, these resonators have 
employed devices for coupling one orthogonal mode to the other orthogonal mode of a TE₁₁₃ mode 
supported in a cylindrical waveguide resonator. By adjusting the amount of coupling between modes, 
it is possible to control the bandwidth for each filter section implemented in a cylindrical waveguide 
resonator. A typical coupling device includes screws which are threaded into the sides of 
the cylindrical waveguide resonator at opposite positions along a common diameter of the waveguide 
resonator. The screws are located along the circumference of the waveguide so that they have 
an axis which is oriented 45° to each axis of the orthogonal modes of the electromagnetic field. 
As the depth of the screws into the waveguide increases, the coupling between two orthogonal 
modes increases.  The coupling achieved through this technique is limited due to the effect of the 
screws on the symmetry of each of the E fields of each orthogonal mode. As the screw depth 
becomes greater, the ultimate filter response becomes severely asymmetric. The degradation symmetry provides for an upper limit on the ability to achieve 
a practical filter bandwith using the foregoing coupling technique. Additionally, the increased 
depth of the screws not only distorts field symmetry, but creates unwanted cross-couplings which 
may create other unwanted modes within the cylindrical resonator. It is an object of this invention to provide for a microwave filter section having 
an increased bandwith and minimal insertion loss. It is a more specific object of this invention to
