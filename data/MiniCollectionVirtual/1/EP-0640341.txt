<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sustained release 
pharmaceutical composition, and more specifically, it 
relates to a sustained release pharmaceutical composition 
for oral administration. More concretely, it relates to a 
sustained release pharmaceutical composition for oral 
administration of a 1,3-dimethyl-6-{2-{N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-[3-(4-nitrophenyl)propyl]amino}ethylamino}-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 
acid compound (hereinafter referred 
to as "the pyrimidinedione derivative" or simply as "the 
drug") which is a compound useful as a class III type 
antiarrhythmic drug and which is Compound 8 mentioned in 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 173873/1991, and 
its preparation process. A pyrimidinedione derivative has been utilized as a 
class III type antiarrhythmic drug, and it exerts an extremely 
excellent effect for an arrhythmic remedy which 
requires a long-term administration of the drug. In addition,  
 
the pyrimidinedione derivative is also a drug effective 
to relieve a heart functional disorder such as heart 
failure. As a long-term administration manner, an oral 
administration has been suggested. For example, in Example 
18 of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 173873/1991, 
the pyrimidinedione derivative is sufficiently mixed 
with lactose and starch, and the resultant mixture is then 
filled into capsules to manufacture the desired drug. The 
present inventors actually carried out an oral administration 
test for the drug. In consequence, they had found for 
the first time that the drug was absorbed by the stomach 
and that its concentration in blood reached a high level 
within 30 minutes from the administration, but the concentration 
in blood lowered rapidly when 2 or 3 hours had 
passed since the administration. In general, the sustained release pharmaceutical 
composition has many advantages of, for example, reducing 
the number of administrations of the drug, decreasing side 
effects and keeping an effective concentration in blood. 
Because the advantages are important, various pharmaceutical 
compositions have been developed. For example, as 
described in Medical Polymer (Kyoritsu Chemical Library, 
Kyoritsu Publisher) p. 115-150 and elsewhere, there have 
been suggested a pharmaceutical composition containing a 
substance capable of easily crumbling in the stomach or the 
intestines, a pharmaceutical composition obtained by coating  
 
tablets or granules of a drug with a hydrophobic substance, 
a pharmaceutical composition obtained by coating a 
drug with a
