<ABSTRACT>
A speedometer (10) comprising a drive shaft 
(12) rotatable about an axis (A); a magnet assembly 

(22) fixedly connected to one end (24) of the drive 
shaft; magnetically responsive means (52) spaced from 

and substantially surrounding an outer circumference 
of the magnet assembly, the magnetically responsive 

means being pivotable about the axis in response to 
rotation of the magnet assembly; and indicating means 

(56) connected to the magnetically responsive means to 
provide an indication of speed; the magnet assembly 

comprising a magnet (26), a mounting means (30) of 
plastics material which is moulded around the magnet, 

the mounting means being secured to the end of the 
drive shaft, and optical contrast means positioned on 

the opposite side (40) of the mounting means to the 
indicating means adjacent the outer circumference of 

the mounting means and comprising a pattern of a 
plurality of substantially identical, equidistantly 

spaced, shaped portions (38) of metallic foil formed 
by hot foil printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a speedometer, and 
in particular to an improved magnet assembly for the 
speedometer. In known arrangements, a speedometer 
comprises a drive shaft (which usually receives a 
mechanical cable drive, for example, from a 
transmission of a motor vehicle) connected to a magnet 
assembly to rotate the magnet assembly. The magnetic 
flux produced by the rotating magnet assembly drives, 
by way of an aluminium or copper cup, a pointer 
spindle and pointer of the speedometer to provide an 
indication of speed. The magnet assembly, which is 
usually a force-fit on the end of the drive shaft, 
comprises a magnet and temperature compensator 
encapsulated in a plastics moulding. The underside 
(that is, the side directed away from the pointer) of 
the moulding may have a pattern printed thereon. An 
optical sensor directed towards the pattern produces a 
series of electrical pulses as the pattern rotates 
which can be used in computer-based control units 
within the vehicle. Because of the complicated shape that the 
plastics material has to flow around in order to 
create the encapsulated part, the plastics material 
must be of a type which is free-flowing. A 
disadvantage of having to use a free-flowing plastics 
material is that the material is subjected to 
shrinkage after moulding which produces an uneven 
surface on the underside of the magnet assembly, 
making accurate printing of the pattern very 
difficult. Poor or inaccurate printing of the pattern 
leads to distorted electrical pulses being generated 
by the optical sensor, making accurate determination 
of velocity very difficult. This problem is  
 
accentuated when the required number of electrical 
pulses per revolution of the magnet assembly is 
increased. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved magnet assembly for a speedometer. To this end, a speedometer in accordance 
with the present invention comprises a drive shaft 
rotatable about an axis; a magnet assembly fixedly 
connected to one end of the drive shaft; magnetically 
responsive means spaced from and substantially 
surrounding an outer circumference of the magnet 
assembly, the magnetically responsive means being 
pivotable about the axis in response to rotation of 
the magnet assembly; and indicating means connected to 
the magnetically responsive means to provide an 
indication of speed; the magnet assembly comprising a 
magnet, a mounting means of plastics material which is 
moulded around the magnet, the mounting means being 
secured

A speedometer (10) comprising a drive 
shaft (12) rotatable about an axis (A); a magnet 

assembly (22) fixedly connected to one end (24) of the 
drive shaft; magnetically responsive means (54) spaced 

from and substantially surrounding an outer 
circumference of the magnet assembly, the magnetically 

responsive means being pivotable about the axis in 
response to rotation of the magnet assembly; and 

indicating means (56) connected to the magnetically 
responsive means to provide an indication of speed; 

the magnet assembly comprising a magnet (26), a 
mounting means (30) of plastics material which is 

moulded around the magnet, the mounting means being 
secured to the end of the drive shaft, and optical 

contrast means positioned on the opposite side (40) of 
the mounting means to the indicating means adjacent 

the outer circumference of the mounting means, 
characterised in that the optical contrast means 

comprises a pattern of a plurality of substantially 
identical, equidistantly spaced, shaped portions (38) 

of metallic foil formed by hot foil printing. 
A speedometer as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the metallic foil is of polished non-ferrous 

metallic material. 
A speedometer as claimed in Claim 2, 
wherein the metallic foil is silver. 
A speedometer as claimed in Claim 2 or 
Claim 3, wherein the plastics mounting means (30) is 

black in colour.
