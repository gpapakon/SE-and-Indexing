<ABSTRACT>
A method of damping underwater sound from a vessel 
(1) driven by one or more propellers (5) comprising 

introducing air and/or other gas into the propeller flow(s) 
so that the turbulence of the propeller flow(s) causes 

mixing of the air/gas and water and disintegration of gas 
bubbles. The majority of the gas bubbles in the water have 

diameters of from 1 to 20 mm. The invention also relates to 
a vessel equipped with apparatus for introducing bubbles 

into the propeller flow(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to the 
preamble of claim 1 for damping underwater sound caused by 
a vessel and to a vessel equipped with apparatus to damp 
underwater sound. When carrying out seismic measurements at sea, 
floating acoustic measuring devices are towed by a vessel. 
However, the noise caused by the vessel may badly disturb 
the function of the measuring devices. To avoid this, it is 
necessary to take action either to damp the noise caused by 
the vessel towing the measuring devices or to lead the noise 
to the sides, so that it cannot disturb the measurement 
operation. It is known from US-A-3084651 to use a water bubble 
zone to damp sound spreading in water and/or to change its 
advancement direction. In this prior art specification it 
is stated that earlier attempts to use an air bubble zone 
for the above mentioned purpose have failed because the air 
bubbles formed have been too large and have joined together 
to form still larger bubbles, which too rapidly rise to the 
water surface. According to the teachings of US-A-3084651, 
air should be mixed into a liquid flow in a pipe, so that a 
water-air mixture is formed which can be injected into the 
water surrounding the vessel. However, this method is 
difficult to apply, because it requires water and air mixing 
tubes to be provided externally of the vessel. The object of the present invention is to solve, in 
a more simple manner, the problems related to the forming of 
an air or gas bubble zone, so that bubbles of suitable size 
as well as a bubble zone of a suitable shape is achieved 
without complicated accessories. According to the present invention this object is 
achieved by a method as claimed in the ensuing claim 1.  By introducing air or other gas into the water in a 
vessel's propeller flow, of which the turbulence, the flow 
speed and the flow rate are precisely known in different 
operating situations, an easily controllable process is 
achieved, in which the turbulence of the propeller flow is 
utilized for disintegrating formed gas bubbles into small 
bubbles and for mixing them effectively with the water. 
Thus, the number and the size of the bubbles can easily be 
adjusted as required. To achieve an effective sound damping, it is 
important that a great number of bubbles formed in the water 
have a diameter of from 1 to 20 mm. Such small bubbles do 
not rise quickly to the water surface but stay suspended in 
the water within a relatively large zone, typically 
extending up to 100 m or more from the

A method for damping underwater sound caused by 
a vessel (1) driven by propeller means (5) which create 

propeller flow or flows in the water, the method comprising 
feeding gas bubbles into the water, characterised in that 

air and/or other gas is introduced to the, or at least some 
of the, propeller flow(s) of said propeller means (5) in 

close vicinity to, and/or behind, the propeller means (5) so 
that the turbulence of the propeller flow(s) causes a strong 

mixing of air and/or gas and water and disintegration of gas 
bubbles, so that the majority of the gas bubbles in the 

gas/water mixture (2) behind the vessel (1) have a diameter 
of from 1 to 20 mm. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that air and/or other gas is also introduced into the water 

either at an edge area of, or outside, the propeller flow(s) 
so that larger gas bubbles (2a) having a diameter in excess 

of 20 mm and which are not disintegrated by said propeller 
flow(s) to have a diameter less than 20 mm, are formed in 

the gas/water mixture. 
A method according to claim 2, characterised in 
that said larger gas bubbles have diameters in the order of 

magnitude of 100 mm. 
A method according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the size of the majority of said 

larger gas bubbles (2a) formed in the water is adjusted to 
a desired frequency range of the damping action so that the 

resonance size of the largest sound damping bubbles 
approximately corresponds to the lower limit of the desired 

damping frequency. 
A method according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said air and/or other gas is 

introduced into the water in such a manner that the ratio of

claims, characterised in that the vessel (1) is a towing 

vessel in which said propeller means comprise a propeller 
(5) or propellers at the fore end of the vessel (1), and in 

that said air and/or other gas is introduced into the water 
so that a gas bubble zone (2c) surrounds substantially the 

entire underwater portion of the vessel (1). 
A method according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the power used to form the 

said gas bubbles is from 1 to 7%, preferably from 2 to 5%, 
of the propulsion power of the vessel (1).

so adjusted that behind the vessel (1) a significant amount 
of gas bubbles exist even at 80 m from the vessel. 
A vessel (1), especially a towing research
