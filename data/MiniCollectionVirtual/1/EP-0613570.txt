<ABSTRACT>
A method for the simulated three-dimensional imaging of an object, comprises the steps of a) creating, simultaneously or sequentially, first and second panoramic images (25, 25a) of the object from two spatially separated positions offset from a common axis of rotation, b) conveying the first and second images (25, 25a) simultaneously to the viewer's right and left eyes separately, and c) moving the first and second images (25, 25a) in synchronism or near-synchronism in response to, or in simulation of, movement of the viewer's head. There are also described systems for creating the images (25, 25a) in step a), and for viewing the images so created.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title : Simulated Three-Dimensional Imaging SystemThis invention relates to apparatus and methods for the creation and viewing of three-dimensional images of real or simulated objects.Methods of simulated three-dimensional photography are known. Conventionally, a three-dimensional photograph is created by taking two photographs of the same object from points separated in space by a distance comparable with the separation of human eyes. The two photographs are then viewed separately, but simultaneously, by the viewer's right and left eyes. This creates an illusion of three-dimensional depth.A shortcoming of conventional three-dimensional photography methods of this kind is that the viewer inevitably has the perception of being outside the object, looking in. The technique thus does not provide the viewer with the perception of being inside the object or three-dimensional space being viewed.Virtual Reality is the name given to technology with which a viewer can achieve this effect. Typically, a Virtual Reality system comprises a headset with two small display screens viewed separately by the viewer's right and left eyes. The position and orientation of the viewer's head are sensed and the images displayed on the screens changed accordingly.Such Virtual Reality systems suffer from the disadvantage that the images are of low quality, even though the systems are relatively expensive.There have now been devised methods and apparatus for simulated three-dimensional imaging of an object or three- dimensional space (hereinafter referred to as "object") which overcome or substantially mitigate the above-mentioned disadvantages. 

 According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for the simulated three-dimensional imaging of an object, which method comprises a) creating, simultaneously or sequentially, first and second panoramic images of the object from two spatially separated positions offset from a common axis of rotation, b) conveying the first and second images simultaneously to the viewer's right and left eyes separately, and c) moving the first and second images in synchronism or near-synchronism in response to, or in simulation of, movement of the viewer's head.The first and/or second images may be real images or simulated images. Real images may be panoramic photographic images. Simulated images may be generated using a computer. Real or simulated images of high quality may both be easily produced.In all cases, the images are preferably positive images so that they may be
