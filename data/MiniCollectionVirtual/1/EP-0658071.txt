input terminals (K1, K2) for connection to a supply voltage source, 
switching means (S1, S2) coupled to the input terminals for generating a high-frequency 
voltage from a supply voltage delivered by the supply voltage source, 
a control circuit (SC) for generating a high-frequency signal for rendering the 
switching means conducting and non-conducting with high frequency, 
a first load branch (I) provided with two ends which are coupled to the 
switching means, with first inductive means (L1), with first capacitive means 

(C1), and with terminals (K3, K4) for accommodating a first discharge lamp 
(La1),

ends of the first load branch, with second inductive means (L2), with second 

capacitive means (C2), and with terminals (K5, K6) for accommodating a 
second discharge lamp (La2). 
According to the invention, the circuit arrangement according to the 
invention is in addition characterized in that the resonance frequency of the first load 

branch is different from the resonance frequency of the second load branch, in that the 
frequency of the high-frequency voltage is higher than the lower resonance frequency 

and lower than the higher resonance frequency, and in that the circuit arrangement is 
provided with means for adjusting the frequency of the high-frequency voltage. 
It is achieved thereby that the ratio between the luminous fluxes of the 
discharge lamps can be controlled in a simple manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating at least two
discharge lamps, comprising
input terminals for connection to a supply voltage source,switching means coupled to the input terminals for generating a high-frequency
voltage from a supply voltage delivered by the supply voltage source,a control circuit for generating a high-frequency signal for rendering the
switching means conducting and non-conducting with high frequency,a first load branch provided with two ends which are coupled to the switching
means, with first inductive means, with first capacitive means, and with
terminals for accommodating a first discharge lamp,a second load branch provided with two ends which are connected to the ends
of the first load branch, with second inductive means, with second capacitive
means, and with terminals for accommodating a second discharge lamp.Such a circuit arrangement is known from German Patent Application
DE 4039161 A1. Two discharge lamps in parallel load branches can be operated with
the known circuit arrangement. A problem which arises in general in the operation of
discharge lamps in parallel load branches is the control of the luminous fluxes of the
discharge lamps. The luminous fluxes of the discharge lamps may, for example, differ
strongly because the discharge lamps have different electrical properties. To counteract
this problem, the known circuit arrangement is provided with a balance transformer. A
first winding of this balance transformer forms part of the first load branch, and a
second winding forms part of the second load branch. It is possible by means of this
balance transformer to minimize a difference between the luminous fluxes of the two
discharge lamps. The balance transformer, however, is a voluminous and comparatively
expensive component. It was found in practice, moreover, that the balance transformer
is less capable of eliminating a difference between the luminous fluxes in proportion as 
the luminous fluxes of the two discharge lamps are set for a lower value. As a result of
this, a comparatively great difference between the luminous fluxes may be present in the
case of low luminous flux set values of the discharge lamps in spite of the presence of
the balance transformer. It was also found in practice that the lowest adjustable
luminous fluxes of the two discharge lamps are strongly dependent on parasitic
capacitances in the circuit arrangement.It is an object of the invention to provide a circuit arrangement by which
two discharge lamps in parallel load
