<CLAIMS>
Anti-lock brake device (100-103) for the wheel 
brakes (VR, HL; VL, HR) of a motor vehicle of a single-circuit 

or multi-circuit braking system for varying the 
brake pressure in the wheel brake cylinders, in which a 

directional control valve arrangement (4; 5) which is 
normally switched to through-flow is inserted into the 

common brake line (2; 3) of a brake circuit, which brake 
line (2; 3) leads from a main brake cylinder (1) to the 

wheel brake cylinders and branches into two brake 
channels for associated brake cylinders of the wheel 

brakes (VR, HL and VL, HR), pressure control devices 
(10; 11), which can be additionally flowed through in the 

brake channels in the case of normal braking, for wheel 
brake cylinders being provided and one controllable means 

(14; 15) being provided per brake circuit for the purpose 
of reducing pressure in a wheel brake cylinder, and at 

least one of the brake channels of a brake circuit being 
connected directly, i.e. without one of these pressure 

control devices (10; 11), to one of the wheel brake 
cylinders which is assigned a [sic]
 vehicle wheel which 
is most involved in the entire braking effect, this 

vehicle wheel being assigned to the front axle of the 
vehicle and the pressure control device (10; 11) being 

arranged in a brake channel (6; 7) leading to a wheel 
brake cylinder of a rear wheel (HL; HR), the controllable 

means being constructed as a return pump (14; 15) which 
can be switched on and off and the intake side of the 

said return pump (14; 15) being connected directly to the 
wheel brake cylinder of the rear wheel (HL; HR), characterized 

in that the directional control valve arrangement  
 

(4; 5) which is inserted into the common brake line (2; 
3) is constructed in the form of a 2/2 way solenoid valve 

(4; 5), in that an outlet side of the return pump (14; 
15) is connected to the common brake line (2; 3) between 

the main brake cylinder (1) and the directional control 
valve arrangement (4; 5), and in that the pressure 

control device (10; 11) is constructed as a pressure 
control device which is designed so as to be capable of 

opening counter to the force of a spring, in the direction 
towards the wheel brake cylinder of the rear wheel 

(HL; HR), by means of pressure and is combined with 
electromagnetically acting means, such as a 2/2 way 

solenoid valve (8; 9) in such a way that in a switched 
position brought about by energization, there is an unimpeded 

through-flow of pressure to the rear-wheel brake

another, the electromagnetically acting means (8 or 9) 

forming an openable bypass around the pressure control 
device (10 or 11).

control device (10 or 11) and the electromagnetically 
acting means (8 or 9) is of similar construction to a 

pilot-operated non-return valve. 
Anti-lock brake device according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the 2/2 way valve (4 or 5)  

 
which is inserted into the common brake line (2; 3) is 

additionally combined with a non-return valve (41 or 51) 
which closes in the pressure increase direction.
