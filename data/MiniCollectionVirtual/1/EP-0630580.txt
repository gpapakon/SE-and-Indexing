<ABSTRACT>
The invention is oil-coated microparticulated gellan gum 
microparticles which are useful as a fat replacer, as an encapsulant and/or 

as a delivery system for food ingredients in low- or no-fat food matrix . 
The microparticles are substantially spherical and have particle sizes 

ranging between about 0.1-10 microns. Primarily, these microparticles 
have particle sizes ranging between 0.1-5.0 microns. The microparticles 

have a narrow size distribution, with about 70-80% ranging between the 
0.1-5.0 micron size. The particles have a high degree of deformability 

and surface hydrophobicity.

<DESCRIPTION>
Spiers et al., WO 9119424 describe alginate fat substitutes
and a method for making them using a mixer and homogenizer . The
substitutes are described as having a range of particle sizes between about
15 and 300 µm, and a mean particle size of about 96 µm.Swientek, FOOD PROCESSING June 1990, pages 152-153,
describes the use of a microfluidizer on finished products to provide
stable emulsions, extended shelf life, and improved mouthfeel, of salad
dressings, sauces and gravies, UHT milk, syrups, chocolate and malted
drinks, flavor oil emulsions, high-butterfat dairy products, creams,
yogurts, fillings, and icings.Singer et al., WO 8912403 describe fat substitutes which comprise water-dispersible macrocolloid particles composed of carbohydrate materials, which particles have a substantially spheroidal shape and a particle size distribution effective to impart the substantially smooth organoleptic character of an oil and water emulsion.The invention is oil-coated microparticulated gellan gum
microparticles which are useful as fat replacers, as encapsulants and/or as
delivery systems for food ingredients in low- or no-fat food matrix . The
microparticles are substantially spherical and have particle sizes ranging
between 0.1-10 microns. Primarily, these microparticles have
particle sizes ranging between 0.1-5.0 microns. The microparticles have
a narrow size distribution, with 70-80% ranging between the 0.1-5.0
micron size. The particles have a high degree of deformability and
surface hydrophobicity.The present invention includes a composition comprising
substantially spherical oil-coated gellan gum microparticles having
particle size diameters between 0.1-10 microns. Preferably, the
composition comprises between 70-80% of the oil-coated gellan
gum microparticles having particle size diameters between 0.1-5.0
microns. In another embodiment of the invention, the oil-coated
gellan gum microparticles have one or more surface functional materials
adhering to the oil coat. Preferably, these surface functional materials are
selected from the group consisting of xanthan gum, propylene glycol
alginate, and proteinaceous materials. More preferably, xanthan gum and
propylene glycol alginate are used in combination as the surface
functional materials.The invention further comprises low-fat food products
comprising 5-25% oil-coated gellan gum microparticles,
preferably 10-15% oil-coated gellan gum microparticles.The invention further comprises low-fat food products
comprising 5-25% oil-coated gellan gum microparticles,
