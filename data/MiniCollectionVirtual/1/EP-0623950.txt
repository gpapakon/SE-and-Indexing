<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for manufacturing a tubular submicrometer structure under a solid-state surface, which structure consists of chemically bonding of the solid-state atoms to foreign atoms which are introduced under the solid-state surface in the form of stripes by ion implantation or by means of selective deposition processes and are caused to react chemically and form the structure by a subsequent defined heat treatment.

Method for manufacture of tubular microstructures in solids, in which foreign atoms (FA) are introduced 
to an area (G) in a solid (F), the height and width of which is limited to submicrometer dimensions, the 

foreign atoms being suitable to form a chemical compound with the atoms of the solid, whereby the 
concentration of foreign atoms in the area (G) after introduction is max. 50 % of the stoichiometric 

concentration of the foreign atoms in the chemical compound, and that temperature treatment is then 
carried out at high temperatures below the melting temperature of the solid material and of the 

chemical compound, in such a way that the solid material and the chemical compound segregate by 
formation of precipitates of the chemical compound, that the precipitates grow further by the known 

Ostwald maturing and concentrate in one or more cylindrical shells, until coalescence of the 
precipitates creates sharp phase boundaries between the chemical compound concentrated in the 

cylindrical shells and the solid material inside and outside these shells. 
Method according to claim 1, in which the foreign atoms are introduced under the surface of the solid in 
the area (G) through mask windows of a masked surface of a solid (MO), in the form of accelerated 

ions. 
Method according to claim 1, in which the foreign atoms (FA) are introduced under the surface of the 
solid in the area (G) in the form of accelerated ions using a writing ion microray with a ray focus 

diameter of less than one micrometer.  
 
Method according to claim 1, in which the area (G) comprising a mixture of solid material and foreign 
atoms is deposited locally, by a layer depositing method, preferably by selective molecular beam 

epitaxy, and that the area (G) is then covered by depositing pure solid material. 
Method according to claims 1 and 4, in which the foreign atoms are deposited in the area (G) in the 
form of their chemical compound with the solid material. 
Method according to claims 1, 2 and 3, in which the number of interpenetrating tubes is determined by 
the dose and energy of the implanted ions and the parameters of the tempering process. 
Method according to claims 1 and 4, in which the number of interpenetrating tubes is determined by the 
parameters of the depositing and tempering process in the area (G). 
Method according to claims 1, 6 and 7, in which the innermost tube is manufactured as a wire, without 
a core. 
Method according to claim 1, in which simultaneously, in the solid, a number of areas (G) are created 
and converted into tubular microstructures.  

 
Method according to claim 1, in which foreign atoms are introduced in the solid, which form a dielectric, 
insulating chemical compound with the solid material, which electrically insulates the area inside the 

tube from the area outside. 
Method according to claim 1, in which foreign atoms are introduced in the solid, which form a chemical 
compound of good electrical conductivity with the solid material. 
Method according to claim 1, in which foreign atoms are introduced in the solid, which form a chemical 
compound with the solid material, which has a different index of refraction from that of the solid 

material, and has low optical absorption for defined optical wavelengths. 
Method according to claim 1, in which the solid material consists of silicium, and as foreign atoms 
oxygen ions with energy of 200 keV in a dose of few 10

 are implanted in the area (G), and 
that a buried silicium-filled silicium dioxide tube is manufactured by temperature treatment in the range 

of at least 1100 °C for several hours to maximum 1405 °C for several minutes. 
Method according to claim 1, in which the manufacture of the tubular microstructure is realized by a 
sequence of introduction and tempering processes. 
Method according to claims 1 - 14, in which the buried tube structures are exposed, locally and in a 
geometrically defined manner, by wet or dry chemical anisotropic and/or selective etching techniques, 

and can be manufactured as unsupported three-dimensional solid-state electronic, vacuum electronic, 
micro-mechanical, micro-optic, micro-fluid and micro-sensoric passive or active components, and 

designed as integrated microsystems.
