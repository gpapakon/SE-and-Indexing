<ABSTRACT>
A seal assembly is mounted on a shaft in sealing 
relationship to provide a sealed chamber in a housing from which 

the shaft extends. The seal assembly includes a unitary annular 
seal body (20) attached to an annular retainer (32). The seal body (20) 

includes three radial sealing lips (44,46,48) in engagement with the shaft (12). 
A primary lip (48) is adjacent the sealed chamber and provides the 

primary fluid seal. A secondary lip (47) is rearward of the primary 
lip and keeps the primary lip aligned with the shaft. A rearward 

lip (44) excludes environmental contaminants from entering the sealed 
chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flexible lip seals. More 
particularly it relates to lip seals which can accomodate 
significant shaft-to-bore misalignment or dynamic runout. Lip seals are molded of of an elastomeric or polymeric 
material and surround a rotating shaft in sealing relationship to 
provide a fluid or gas tight chamber in a housing from which the 
shaft extends. Such seals embody components or elements 
including a retainer to aid installation, withdrawal and 
retention of a seal body relative to a housing; and one or more 
elastomeric or polytetrafluorethylene sealing lips. The lip seals of the present invention are particularly 
suited for, but not limited to, use in conjunction with 
automotive air conditioning compressors. This type of service is 
particularly severe. The refrigerant to be sealed usually has a 
deliterious effect on elastomeric and other seal materials. The 
pressure ranges, from vacuum to high, and the temperature ranges 
are extreme. In addition, the economies of automobile production 
require constant effort to reduce weight and cost. Equipment 
design tends toward light weight or duty. The result is that 
seals must accomodate more extreme specifications in terms of 
permissible misalignment between shaft and bore and also dynamic 
runout.  The seal of the present invention utilizes a unitary 
seal body having several sealing lips. Previous lip seals have 
utilized separate seal body components requiring assembly. These 
prior designs pose several potential problems, including improper 
installation of seal components, missing seal components, 
improper axial compression of seal components and a set internal 
gasket compression. Often, one or more of these problems 
conspire to result in internal leakage through the assembled 
seal. The seal of the present invention provides a solution 
to these problems. In accordance with the present invention there is 
provided a unitary elastomeric body which defines three radial 
sealing lips. The first is a primary sealing lip adjacent a 
chamber of the housing containing a pressurized fluid. A 
secondary sealing lip serves as an alignment member for the 
primary sealing lip. The final sealing lip deflects outward of 
the housing toward the environment during seal installation and 
excludes environmental contamination from entering the housing 
chamber. The seal body is a unitary, annular, elastomeric 
element molded to a rigid annular retainer. The secondary lip, 
when deflected during seal installation, comes into contact with 
a

<CLAIMS>
In a housing defining a bore centered about a bore 
axis, and having a rotatable shaft centered about a shaft axis, 

an annular seal mounted around said shaft in sealing relationship 
to provide a sealed chamber in said housing, said seal including 

a unitary seal body defining a body portion extending radially 
between inner and outer ends, and axially between inboard and 

outboard ends, wherein said inboard end is closer to said sealed 
chamber than said outboard end, said seal body comprising: 

   a cylindrical base portion extending axially from said 
body portion and defining an inner base surface; 

   a primary lip extending radially inwardly from said 
base portion and engaging said shaft in sealing relationship; 

and 
   an alignment lip joined to said radially inner end of 

said body portion and defining an inner alignment surface and an 
outer alignment surface, said inner alignment surface contacting 

said shaft and said outer alignment surface contacting said inner 
base surface when said shaft axis and said bore axis are aligned. 
A seal as recited in claim 1 wherein said 
alignment lip has a thickness equal to the radial distance 

between an outer surface of said shaft and said inner base 
surface, such that displacement of said shaft axis from said bore 

axis causes corresponding radial displacement of said base 
portion and said primary lip to maintain said primary lip 

 
concentric about said shaft axis. 
A seal as recited in claim 2 wherein a radial face 
is formed at said inboard end of said body portion, said base 

portion extending axially inboard of said radial face, and an 
undercut is formed in said face radially outward of said base 

portion, said undercut accomodating radial displacement of said 
base portion. 
A seal as recited in claim 1 wherein said alignment 
lip has a length such that an axial extent of said alignment lip 

contacts said inner base surface at an axial location midway 
between said radial face of said body portion and the juncture of 

said primary lip with said base portion. 
A seal as recited in claim 1 wherein the length of 
said base portion is approximately equal to the distance between 

said inboard and outboard ends of said body portion. 
A seal as recited in claim 1 wherein said seal body 
further comprises an outboard lip adjacent said outboard end of 

said body portion and extending radially inwardly and axially 
outboard to contact said shaft and exclude externa
l contaminants 
from said sealed chamber. 
A seal as recited in claim 1 and further comprising 
a retainer bonded to said seal body. 
A seal as recited in claim 1 wherein said seal body 
is made of elastomeric or polymeric materials. 
A seal as recited in claim 3 wherein said radial 
face of said body portion abuts an annular shoulder formed in 

said housing. 
A seal as recited in claim 1 wherein said seal 
body defines a ring portion ajacent said radially outer end of 

said body portion, said ring portion extending coaxially in 
relation to said base portion. 
A seal as recited in claim 10 wherein an outer 
surface of said ring portion includes a plurality of axially 

spaced circumferential ribs formed therein, said ribs engaging 
an inner annular sealing surface of said housing in sealing 

relationship. 
A seal assembly as recited in claim 6 wherein a 
recess is formed in said body portion radially outwardly of said 

outboard lip to accomodate radial displacement of said outboard 
lip. 
A seal as recited in claim 1 wherein said housing 
defines an annular groove, and a snap ring is disposed in said 

groove to secure said seal within said housing.
