<ABSTRACT>
The machine forms grooves in the cylindrical wall of a bore (1) in a component (2). It has milling spindles (3) with cutters (28) in the same number as the grooves in a planetary pattern round a central bar (42), and sliding in a bearing housing (24). A housing section (25) containing components controlling radial movement of the spindles is coupled to a centring member (26) extending towards the bore, and at the other side to an intermediate piece (46) in turn forming a piston working in a cylinder in the gearbox, the central bar being also coupled to the latter. When the centring member encounters a resistance, the gearbox travels for a set distance towards the bore (1).

<CLAIMS>
Device for inserting a plurality of dimples (3) 
in a cylindrical wall of a counterbore (1) provided in a 

component (2), having a number of milling spindles (13) 
which corresponds to the number of dimples to be inserted 

simultaneously, which spindles are arranged planet-like 
relative to a central rod (42), carry one milling cutter 

(28) each and are guided in a bearing housing (24), a 
housing part (25) containing the control elements for a 

radial movement of the milling spindles (13) being 
connected to a centring piece (26) facing the counterbore 

(1) and to an intermediate piece (46) remote from the 
counterbore, which intermediate piece (46) in turn makes 

a type of cylinder/piston connection with a gear housing 
(11), the central rod (42) being connected to the gear 

housing (11), and the gear housing (11) performing a 
predeterminable movement in the direction of the counterbore 

(1) after the centring piece (26) runs against a 
resistance, characterized in that a housing (50) of 

cross-shaped cross-section is movable in the axial 
direction of the housing part (25) relative to the 

latter, and in that the cross-shaped housing (50) has 
nipples (59) which project in its interior, are in each 

case arranged opposite one another and are displaceable 
in grooves (60) of the bearing housing (24) which are 

likewise arranged opposite one another and diverge in the 
direction of the centring piece (26), in that the part of 

the centring piece (26) facing the counterbore is 
designed as a stop (34) movable relative to the centring 

piece (26) and to a sleeve-shaped thrust piece (39), and  
 

in that the thrust piece (39) comes into contact with a 
locking element (37) with its end facing the counterbore 

(1) and comes into contact with the central rod (42) with 
its other end. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a plurality of push rods (51) are allocated to the 

gear housing (11), in that each push rod (51), with its 
end remote from the gear housing (11), abuts against a 

bracket (52) of the cross-shaped housing (50), and in 
that a bolt (53) screwed into a cap (55) of the housing 

part (25) passes with its free end through the bracket 
(52) and projects into a centre bore (54) of the push rod 

(51), and in that each bolt (53) accommodates a disc-spring 
stack (56) acting between the cap (55) and the 

bracket (52). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the centring piece (26) is detachably connected to 

the housing part (25), lockable pins (63) of the centring 
piece (26) coming to bear against a spring-mounted stop 

bolt (31). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the stop (34) is a collar bolt, through which a 

plurality of body-fit screws (36) pass in the region of 
the collar (35), which body-fit screws (36) are screwed 

in position in the centring piece and permit the 
predeterminable travel of the stop, in that the bolt part 

(38) of the collar bolt projects into the thrust piece 
(39) and is supported relative to the thrust piece in a 

spring-mounted manner, in that a transverse pin (23) 
passing through the bolt part (38) is guided in an 

elongated hole (43) of the thrust piece (39), and in that 
the locking element consists of a plurality of spring-mounted 

cylinders (37) which engage in an annular groove 
(62), arranged between transverse pin and collar, of the 

bolt part (38). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the centring piece (26) has a centring aid (44) 

which acts radially outwards and comes to bear against 
the cylindrical wall of the counterbore (1).  

 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a displacement-measuring device (49) for checking 

the relative movement of the gearing housing (11) is 
allocated to the intermediate piece (46). 
Method of inserting a plurality of dimples (3) in 
a cylindrical wall of a counterbore (1) provided in a 

component (2) with a device according to one of Claims 2 
to 6, characterized in that the device is brought into 

position in alignment with the centring piece (26) and 
relative to the counterbore (1), in that the milling 

spindles (13) are set in rotation, in that, by moving the 
device in the axial direction, the stop (34) is brought 

to bear against a base surface of the counterbore (1) and 
is moved relative the centring piece (26) until the 

locking is neutralized, and in that, after the locking is 
neutralized, the gear housing (11) is moved by a 

predeterminable extent in the direction of the centring 
piece (26) together with the central rod (42), the thrust 

piece (39) and the cross-shaped housing (50), in the 
course of which a radially directed feed movement of the 

milling spindles (13) and thus of the milling cutters 
(28) is continuously effected, and in that the device is 

retracted in the axial direction, in the course of which 
the force of the disc-spring stack (56) moves the cross-shaped 

housing (50), the bearing housing (24) with the 
milling spindles (13), and the gear housing (11) back 

into their initial position and the locking between stop 
(34) and centring piece (26) is restored.
