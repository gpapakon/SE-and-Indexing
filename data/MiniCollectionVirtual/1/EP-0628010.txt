<ABSTRACT>
In a packaging element or preform consisting of a base material (1, 8) in sheet or web form (of which only small parts are shown) with a number of pocket-shaped raised portions (15) intended to be placed in a protective position between the packaged article (29) and external packaging means, e.g. a corrugated-paper box (30), the new feature consists in that the angle (21) between mutually opposing wall parts in the side wall (16) of the raised portions (15) is between 20 DEG and 40 DEG , preferably approximately 40 DEG . With this arrangement, an overloading of the raised portion (15) will cause the side wall (16) to be deformed plastically when acted upon by a roughly constant force while forming "accordeon pleats" (20), without the raised portion (15) at any time losing its supporting ability. The risk of the side wall (16) collapsing under load may be reduced further by giving the side wall (16) an outwardly convex curvature (not shown).

<DESCRIPTION>
PACKAGING ELEMENT OR PREFORM OF FIBRE PULP WITH RAISED PORTIONSTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a packaging element or preform of the kind set forth in the preamble of Claim 1.BACKGROUND ARTPackaging elements of this kind are used as intermediary supporting means when packaging apparatus to be protected against impact in an outer packaging element. One example that may be mentioned is impact-sensitive electro¬ mechanical equipment, such as video-tape recorders, to be packaged in an outer corrugated-paper box for shipping purposes.When an article packed in this manner is exposed to rough treatment, e.g. by falling on a hard surface, the raised portions in the packaging element must be able to absorb at least part of the energy of the fall in order to protect the sensitive equipment.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONIn the situation referred to above, it is of great importance that the raised portions have an appropriate "compression characteristic", as they must be sufficiently rigid to resist deformation by loads within the permitted limits, but at the same time they must be able to yield under powerful impact loads, in order to prevent all the impact energy from being transmitted to the packaged equipment and damage the same. In order to achieve this effect, the packaging element or preform according to the present invention primarily exhibit also the features set forth in the characterizing clause of Claim 1.The effect of the feature set forth in item c in Claim 1 is 

that each raised portion or projection is given a certain limiting strength - corresponding to the greatest force it can withstand without being deformed - and by suitable choice of the size and number of the raised portions or projections, this makes it possible to adapt the packaging element or preform to whatever the packaged article concerned can withstand.The effect of the feature set forth in item d is that when the force referred to above is exceeded, the raised portions or projections will be compressed while providing a substantially constant counter-force without collapsing so that at all stages of the compression process they still have the same limiting strength. Because of the inherent properties of the fibre-pulp material, this process will result in a permanent deformation, so that it is possible when opening the package to ascertain that the packaged equipment has been exposed to inertial forces comparable to the deformation resistance of the raised portions or projections.Additional protection against the

CLAIMS
1. Packaging element or preform of the kind manufactured from fibre pulp and comprising a) a base material (1,5,6,7) in web or sheet form, and b) protruding from said base material, projections (2- 5,15) with a wall thickness of the same order of magnitude as the wall thickness of the base material, characterized in c) that each of the projections (2-5,15) comprises an encircling side wall (16) shaped in continuation of the base material and converging away from the latter, as well as an end wall (17) shaped in continuation of the opposite edge of said side wall, of which end wall (17) at least the rim portion (18) situated closest to the side wall extends at least approximately parallel to the base material, and d) that the oppositely facing sides in the side wall (16) form an angle (21) with each other of at least 20" and at the most 40°, preferably approximately 30°.
2. Packaging element or preform according to Claim 1, characterized in that at least substantial portions of the side wall as seen in a sectional view (X-X) parallel to the base material are curved with outwardly facing convexity.
3. Packaging element or preform according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that in at least one raised portion (15), the end wall (17) is shaped with at least one projection (19) facing away from the base material.
