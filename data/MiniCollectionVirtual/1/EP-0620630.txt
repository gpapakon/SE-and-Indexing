<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superconducting 
fault current limiter, more particularly to a fault current 
limiter utilizing the superconductivity of a ceramic high-temperature 
superconductor the superconducting state of 
which is switched to a resistive state when a 
fault current beyond a critical value In recent years, there has been proposed an inductive 
current limiter for protection of a circuit breaker, a 
transformer in power networks from fault currents caused by 
a short-circuit or thunderbolt. When applied with fault 
currents, the inductive current limiter provides a high 
impedance which limits the fault currents to restrain an 
electric load acting on the circuit breaker and transformer 
below a threshold level. In U.S. Patent No. 5,140,290 
there is disclosed a high power inductive 
current limiter of this kind which is composed of an 
induction coil with at least one winding through which 
current flows, a cylindrical body made of a ceramic high-temperature 
superconducting material concentrically arranged 
within the induction coil, and a core made of a soft  
 
magnetic material of high permeability and concentrically 
disposed within the cylindrical body. In normal operation, 
the superconductivity of the cylindrical body shields the 
magnetic field of the induction coil completely from the 
core (Meissner effect), and impedance of the induction coil 
is maintained at a very low level to minimize loss of the 
electric power. When a fault current flows through the 
induction coil due to a short-circuit or thunderbolt, the 
superconductivity of the cylindrical body disappears and 
the impedance of the induction coil reaches its maximum, 
current-limiting value. To maintain the superconductivity of the cylindrical 
body in normal operation, the inductive current limiter is 
immersed in cooling liquid such as liquid nitrogen. Since 
the conventional fault current limiter is entirely immersed 
in the cooling liquid to cool the superconductive body, the 
cooling device becomes large in size. In actual use of the 
fault current limiter, the induction coil is heated by its 
self-resistance when applied with transport current, and 
the iron core is also heated by the flow of eddy current 
caused by a magnetic field acting thereon after transition 
to the resistive state. As a result, the cooling liquid is 
heated by heat generation of the induction coil and iron 
core, resulting in a decrease of the cooling efficiency of 
the cooling liquid. In case the cooling liquid vapors on 
the
