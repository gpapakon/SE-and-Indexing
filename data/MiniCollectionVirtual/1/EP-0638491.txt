<ABSTRACT>
Truck provided with a device (8) for taking up a garbage 
container (9) and emptying it into a collecting container 

(4) positioned on the chassis (1) of the truck. The collecting 
container has been mounted on the chassis (1) interchangeably, 

so that a container can be used for given materials. 
The device (8) for taking up a garbage container (9) 

is situated between a receiving member (6) mounted to the 
collecting 
container (4) and the cabin (3) and comprises a 
gripping member (20) rotatably mounted to the end of an arm, 

consisting of a number of portions (13, 14, 17, 19) slidably 
and rotatably movable in relation to one another. By operating 

the various portions from the cabin (5) of the truck, 
the gripping member can grip the garbage container (9), 

bring it up and have it tilt so that the garbage present 
therein will fall out into the receiving member (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a truck provided with a device 
for taking up a garbage container and emptying it into the 
collecting container positioned on the chassis of the truck, 
said device comprising a rotatably mounted gripping member 
being able to grip the garbage container, bring it up and 
tilt it over, so that the garbage present therein falls out 
into the collecting container. With the known trucks for collecting household garbage, 
the collecting container has been fixedly mounted to the 
chassis of the truck and the device for taking up a garbage 
container is generally at the back of the collecting container. 
Consequently, for operating the device, there will 
always have to be a person present at the back of the truck. 
When the collecting container is full, the truck first has 
to be driven to a place where the container can be emptied 
before the further collection can be proceeded. When the area to be served is of a limited size, the 
truck will not be in use every day of the week. Naturally, 
this is inefficient. A further difficulty of the known system lies in the 
fact, that when the truck has been used for collecting 
vegetable, fruit and garden garbage, or other household 
garbage by which the collecting container has become dirty, 
the truck has to be cleaned first in order to make it suitable 
for collecting wastepaper, for example. The invention seeks to remove these difficulties and to 
that end provides for a truck with a chassis suitable for 
taking up an interchangeable collecting container, in which 
at the side facing the cabin of the truck, this collecting 
container has been provided with a receiving member coupled 
to a compacting member for compacting garbage deposited in 
the receiving member into the container, with the device for 
taking up a garbage container and emptying it being situated 
between the receiving member and the cabin, said device comprising 
an arm composed of a number of portions with the  
 
gripping member at its end, such that a garbage container 
placed at some distance from the device and at the side of 
the truck can be gripped, picked up and be rotated backward 
in order to be brought over the receiving member in order to 
be emptied into the receiving member. In this way it is achieved, that when the collecting 
container is full, it can be immediately replaced by an 
empty one, as a result of which the standstill period of the 
truck can be limited. The full container can be discharged 
in order to be emptied at a suitable moment.

<CLAIMS>
Truck provided with a device (8) for taking up a 
garbage container (9) and emptying it into a collecting container 

(4) positioned on the chassis (1) of the truck, said 
device (8) comprising a rotatably mounted gripping member 

(20) being able to grip the garbage container (9), bring it 
up and tilt it over, so that the garbage present therein 

falls out into the collecting container (4), characterized 
in that the chassis of the truck is suitable for taking up 

an interchangeable collecting container (4), in which at the 
side facing the cabin (3) of the truck, this collecting 

container has been provided with a receiving member (6) coupled 
to a compacting member (7) for compacting garbage 

deposited in the receiving member (6) into the container 
(4), with the device (8) for taking up a garbage container 

and emptying it being situated between the receiving member 
(6) and the cabin (3), said device comprising an arm composed 

of a number of portions (13, 14, 17, 19) with the gripping 
member (20) at its end, such that a garbage container 

(9) placed at some distance from the device (8) and at the 
side of the truck can be gripped, picked up and be rotated 

backwards in order to be brought over the receiving member 
(6) and to be emptied thereinto. 
Truck according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the arm of the device for taking up a garbage container (9) 

consists of at least two portions (13, 14) telescopically 
slidable in one another, a first rotating arm portion (17) 

being pivotably connected to the free end of the outer 
slidable portion (14), such that said portion (17) is rotatable 

in relation to the telescopically slidable portion 
(14) in a plane going through the axis of the slidable 

portions (13, 14), a second rotating arm portion (19) being 
pivotably connected to the other end of the first rotating 

arm portion (17) and being rotatable in a plane square to 
the plane in which the first rotating arm portion (17) is 

rotatable, said second rotating arm portion (19) having its 
other end provided with the gripping member (20) for gripping 

a garbage container (9), said gripping member being  
 

rotatable in relation to the rotating arm portion (19) 
according to two axes (22, 23) being square to each other, 

means having been provided for sliding and rotating the 
various parts of the device (8) in relation to one another. 
Truck according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the innermost portion (13) of the portions (13, 14) being 

telescopically slidable within one another is mounted such 
that the axis of these portions extends almost horizontally 

and is adjustable in vertical height parallel to itself. 
Truck according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the gripping member (20) is composed of a frame (21) 

connected to the second rotating arm portion (14) in such a 
way, that in relation to this portion it is rotatable about 

two axes (22, 23) being square to each other, a take up 
member (24) being rotatable about an almost horizontal axis 

(25) in relation to the frame (21) and having a hook-shaped 
portion (26) being able to grip underneath the edge of a 

garbage container (9) and having been provided with at least 
one leg (29) directed downwards in the position in which a 

garbage container (9) is taken up, and having been provided 
with a cross beam (30) at its lower end, for supporting the 

lower end of a container (9), and a clamping member (31) 
rotatably connected to the take up member (24), said clamping 

member comprising two spaced apart legs (32) which, 
after bringing the hook-shaped portion (26) underneath the 

edge of the garbage container (9), are clamped onto the edge 
(33) of the container, next to its lid (34), by rotating the 

clamping member, in which the rotation of the clamping member 
(31) in relation to the take up member (24) is obtained, 

in that the clamping member (31) has been coupled to at

frame (20). 
Truck according to one of the preceding claims,

member to the container and lifting the container slightly, 
after which by operating a single button, the complete 

process of taking up, rotating, emptying and returning the 
garbage container to its initial position is performed 

automatically and the garbage container (9) is put down in
