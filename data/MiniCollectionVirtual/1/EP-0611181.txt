<ABSTRACT>
Process for reconstructing three-dimensional images of a changing object. The system of equations which defines the contribution of each of the points of the object to the property or to the function measured by sums along projections terminating at the measurement sensors is solved by means of auxiliary conditions which represent an assumed variation of the property as a function of time. Applications to medical imaging and industrial inspections.

<CLAIMS>
Method for reconstructing three-dimensional images of an object (1)
defined by values assumed by a property (f) in a ne
twork of points (P) of
the object and consisting of carrying out at certain moments (1, ...., t,

..., NPSI) measurements (m) of the sums of the property on lines (5)
projected onto the sensors (4) of a two-dimensional network (3), the network

of sensors being orientated differently around the object on each
measurement and the values of the property changing with the time and then

of resolving a system of linear equations expressing the measured sums of
the property according to the values of the property on the points and

weighting coefficients (H), characterized in that it also consists of
expressing the changes at each point of the network of points between the

successive measurements by a change function and of resolving the system
of equations by using the changing function so as to express the measured

sums according to the values of the property on the points taken solely
for certain moments.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the change function
is defined by invariable matrices so as to express the change of values

of the property at a given moment according to the value of the property
at the preceding moment and at the next moment.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the system of
equations is resolved by iterations.
