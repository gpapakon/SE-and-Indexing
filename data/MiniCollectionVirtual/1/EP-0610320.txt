<DESCRIPTION>
Next to cellulose, chitin is the world's most abundant,
easily obtained, and renewable biological material. It is a
natural product synthesized by a wide variety of organisms.
Several billion tons of the material are produced annually.Chitin is a carbohydrate polymer, the N-acetylated
polymer of β(1→4) linked N-acetylglucosamine, or poly-N-acetyl
glucosamine. In plants, chitin is a cell wall
constituent replacing cellulose or sometimes occurring
together with cellulose. In animals, chitin is usually
organized as a cuticle at one surface of the epithelial
tissue. Although structurally similar to cellulose, chitin
has distinctly different chemical properties. It is an
extremely insoluble material, with limited industrial
applicability.The deacetylated derivative of chitin, chitosan, is a
much more tractable material with a broad and impressive
array of practical applications. Chitosan is positively
charged, thus, it can be used as a protein precipitant and a
metal chelating agent. It can be formulated as a solution,
gel, membrane, film or fiber. Such formulations are useful,
for example, in the areas of precious metal recovery, crop
protection, chromatography and enzyme immobilization.
Chitosan is a biologically benign, non-immunogenic, material
making it ideal for use in the agricultural, food, drug and
cosmetic industries. It can form complexes with other
natural polymers, such as collagen and keratin, to form
materials with unique biomedical properties. For example,
such materials can be used as wound healing accelerants,
components of artificial skin and blood vessels,
anticoagulants, and controlled drug release vehicles. At present the bulk of the chitosan produced worldwide
is prepared from crustacean shell material. Chitin
comprises about 20-50% of the dry weight of crustacean
cuticles, the balance being primarily calcium carbonate,
calcium phosphate and other proteins. Chitin is first
isolated by treating ground crustacean shells with dilute
acid and alkali to remove proteins and minerals. The raw
chitin is then deacetylated by exposure to concentrated
alkali at high temperature to generate chitosan. Although
the chitosan produced in this manner has many useful
features, it is impossible to effectively control the
production process, which leads to the production of a
material having a broad range of molecular weight and a
heterogenous extent of deacetylation. Such a product is not
of great value, since many of the potentially important.
