<ABSTRACT>
Repulpable contact adhesive based on a graft polymer in which 3-20% by weight of vinyl compounds having sulphonic acid salt groups are grafted onto a copolymer of (meth)acrylates and (meth)acrylic acid and which is rendered tacky by means of water-soluble plasticisers.

<CLAIMS>
Repulpable contact adhesive based on a graft 
polymer in which, relative to the graft copolymer, 3-20% 

by weight of vinyl compounds having sulphonic acid salt 
groups are grafted onto a copolymer comprising (meth)acrylates 

and (meth)acrylic acid, and which has been 
rendered tacky by means of water-soluble plasticizers. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the copolymer consists of acrylic 

acid and alkyl acrylates having 1-12 C atoms in the alkyl 
chain, which exhibits as little branching as possible. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the copolymer additionally contains 

minor amounts of copolymerizable monomers, such as 
(meth)acrylamide derivatives or N-vinyllactams. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the copolymer contains 15-95% by 

weight of (meth)acrylic acid. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the monomers to be grafted onto the 

copolymer are preferably (meth)acrylates having sulphonic 
acid salt groups on the alkyl radical. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the contact adhesive film is weakly 

crosslinked. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that it contains polyethylene glycols 

which are liquid at room temperature, polypropylene 
glycols, mixtures thereof or copolymers or ethoxylated or 

propoxylated alkylamines having alkyl radicals of C

as plasticizers. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the amount of plasticizers in the 

contact adhesive film is 40-75% by weight. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that it contains 3-30% by weight of 

polar adhesive resins in order to increase the adhesive 
power. 
Repulpable contact adhesive according to Claim 1,  
 

characterized in that some or all of the carboxyl groups 
present have been neutralized. 
Use of a contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
for contact adhe
sive applications, in particular those in 
which paper substrates are used and repulping is carried 

out. 
Use of a contact adhesive according to Claim 1, 
together with a paper substrate, for self-adhesive tapes, 

labels or contact adhesive articles.
