<ABSTRACT>
An electro-pneumatic door-operating system in passenger transport vehicles, in particular for outer swing doors of buses. A drive cylinder (3) which can be acted upon on both sides can be connected to a compressed air source (1) via a reversing valve (2). The reversing valve (2) can assume three valve positions for the closing movement, the opening movement and a powerless state in which the drive cylinder (3) is acted upon on both sides. The powerless state is triggered by actuation of an emergency release (4). An emergency control device for triggering an opening movement of the door has a bistable relay (5) with a first relay contact (5.1) which effects the closing movement in a "CLOSED" position and effects the opening movement in an "OPEN" position and is connected to a voltage source (SP) on the one hand via the driver's pushbutton (S1) and on the other hand via a second relay contact (5.2) and an opening switch (S2) which closes in the event of an attempt at opening. The relay (5) has a T input (5.3) which is connected to the driver's pushbutton (S1) and an S input (5.4) which is connected to an emergency switch (S3). When the emergency switch (S3) is actuated, the first relay contact (5.1) is placed in the "OPEN" position and the second relay contact (5.2) closed. When the opening switch (S2) closes, the opening movement of the door is effected.

Electropneumatic door drive in vehicles for 
conveying passengers, in particular for external swing 

doors of buses, having at least one pneumatic drive 
cylinder (3) with pistons (3.3) which can be acted on on 

both sides, which drive cylinder (3) can be connected by 
a change-over valve (2) to a compressed air source (1), 

the change-over valve (2) having a first electrically 
actuable control input (2.1) for achieving a valve 

position in which the side of the piston (3.3) which 
brings about the closing movement of the door is acted 

on, and a second electrically actuable control input 
(2.2) for achieving a valve position in which the side of 

the piston (3) which brings about an opening movement of 
the door is acted on, and a third electrically or 

pneumatically actuable control input (2.3) for achieving 
a valve position in which both sides of the piston (3.3) 

are acted on in order to produce a powerless state, and 
in which door drive an emergency unlocking device is 

provided from which the third control input (2.3) of the 
change-over valve (2) can be actuated, characterized in 

that the emergency unlocking device has an emergency 
control device for triggering an opening movement of the 

door in the event of an attempt to open it manually, with 
a bistable relay (5) which has a first relay contact 

(5.1) which in a "closed" position connects the first 
control input (2.1) and in an "open" position connects 

the second control input (2.2) of the change-over valve 
(2) to a voltage feedline (6) which can be connected to 

a pole of a voltage source (SP) on the one hand via a 
switch (S1) which can be actuated by the driver and on  

 
the other hand via a second relay contact (5.2) which is 

open in the "closed" position of the first relay contact 
(5.1) and is closed in the "open" position of the first 

relay contact (5.1) and via an opening switch (S2) which 
is arranged in the region of the door or of the door 

drive, the opening switch (S2) being arranged in such a 
way that it closes in the event of an attempt to open the 

door manually, and the relay (5) has two control inputs, 
the first (5.3) of which is constructed as a T-input and 

can be fed with control impulses via the switch (S1) 
which can be actuated by the driver whilst the second 

(5.4) is constructed as an S-input and can be fed with a 
control signal via an emergency switch (S3), by means of 

which control signal the first relay contact (5.1) is 
switched to the "open" position. 
Door drive according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the emergency switch (S3) is coupled to a switching 

device (4) by means of which the third control input 
(2.3) of the change-over valve (2) can be actuated. 
Door drive according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the switching device is constructed as an emergency 

actuator (4) via which the third control input (2.3) of 
the change-over valve (2) can be connected pneumatically 

to the compressed air source (1). 
Door drive according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that in a change-over valve (2) in which, in the case of 

actuation of the third control input (2.3) switching back 
into one of the two other valve positions is only possible 

via the first or second control input (2.1, 2.2), 
the activation of the emergency switch (S3) takes place 

by actuating the emergency actuator (4) which is automatically 
returned to the neutral position. 
Door drive according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the opening switch (S2) is constructed 

as a limit switch which responds to a lifting 
movement of the door. 
Door drive according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the opening switch (S2) is constructed 

as a pressure wave switch which is arranged in  
 

a sensing edge of the door. 
Door drive according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that a further limit switch (S4) is 

arranged in series with the opening switch (S2) and opens 
when the door is closed. 
Door drive according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the emergency switch (S3) is located in a 

circuit which contains a switch (S7) which is coupled to 
a pressure sensor (10) in such a way that when the 

pressure in the compressed airline falls below a 
predetermined pressure the switching position of the 

switch (S7) is changed in such a way that the S input 
(5.4) of the relay (5) is fed a control signal by means 

of which the first relay contact (5.1) is switched into

which is connected to an actuation device (9.1-9.2) is

outputs, when a predetermined value of the vehicle speed 

is reached, a control signal which opens the switching 
element (S6) and by means of which this control circuit 

is disconnected.
