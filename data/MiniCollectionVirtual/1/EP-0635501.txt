<ABSTRACT>
Inhibition of the enzymes cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEH) and/or 
acyl coenzyme 

A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) results in the inhibition of the 
esterification of 

cholesterol and are therefore implicated in the inhibition of 
absorption of cholesterol 

and thus can lower serum cholesterol levels. Tris carbamic acid esters 
of the formula: 


where Z is 

   or -Ar¹-(CR=CR)₁₋₃-Ar², -Ar¹-NR⁷-AR² and A is 
a linking group inhibit the 

enzymes CEH and/or ACAT (in vitro) and inhibit absorption of cholesterol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tris carbamic acid esters, processes for preparing them and 
pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Cholesterol ester hydrolase and acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase have been 
implicated in the reesterification and absorption of exogenous cholesterol. It has been 
demonstrated that removal of CEH from pancreatic juice results in an 80% reduction in 
the uptake of cholesterol into the bloodstream in rats [Hoisie, J. Biol. Chem. 262, 260-264 
(1987).] Furthermore, several lines of investigation have indicated that ACAT may 
play a key role in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol [DeVries et al., J. Med. Chem. 
29, 1131(1985)]. The association between high serum cholesterol levels and coronary 
vascular disease is well documented; consequently compounds of this invention may be 
useful for treating atherosclerosis, familial hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and 
like diseases. This invention relates to novel carbamic acid esters of 4 to 8 membered 
azacycloalkanols, particularly 4-piperidinol, which inhibit absorption of cholesterol 
from the intestinal tract and have been shown to inhibit the enzymes, cholesterol ester 
hydrolase (CEH) and/or acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). The novel 
CEH/ACAT inhibitors of this invention have the formula:
