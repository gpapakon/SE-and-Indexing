<ABSTRACT>
A hair styling mousse product comprising a manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser equipped with a reservoir, dispensing head and liquid/air mixing means, the reservoir containing a hair styling mousse composition comprising a hair setting resin, a polycationic hair conditioning resin, an amphoteric surfactant and water or a water/solvent mixture. The product generates a high quality mousse with good initial foam formation, foam breakdown under shear, non-soapiness, easy spreadibility and non-stickiness.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Hair CosmeticTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to hair styling mousse products. In particular it relates to non-aerosol hair styling mousse products which provide optimum foaming, hair setting, hair feel and hair conditioning characteristics while reducing stickiness and being easily spreadable on the hair.Background of the InventionThe desire to have hair retain a particular shape or configuration is one that is widely held. It is possible to alter the shape of the hair either permanently or temporarily. Permanent alteration involves the use of chemical agents to react with the hair in order to achieve the desired effect. This process can be carried out at either room or elevated temperature.The temporary set given to hair is, as the term indicates, a temporary arrangement which can be removed by water or by shampooing. The materials used to provide the set have generally been resins or gums. The temporary set compositions have taken the form of gels, lotions and sprays as well as others. The compositions are applied most often to hair dampened with water, combed or by other means spread through the hair and let dry. The set given will vary depending on the materials used.In recent years a form of a temporary set has been achieved by means of an aerosol foam - a mousse. The general appeal of mousses can be largely attributed to the ease of application and controlled amount of product which are possible from mousse formulations. Mousse formulations can easily be 

 /02115worked through the hair and can provide a set comparable to that given by a gel or a lotion. These products are generally applied to the user's hand and worked through the hair.The conventional hair styling mousse generally utilizes a water soluble polymer, water, possibly a conditioning agent, an emulsifier, aesthetic agents and the propellant. More recently, however, due to an increasing public awareness of the effects of volatile organic compounds, such as aerosol propellants, on the environment, hair styling mousse products have been formulated without a propellant and dispensed from a manually-actuable container so as to be of the non-aerosol type. Unfortunately, however, there are a number of problems associated with non-aerosol products. In particular they provide mousses which are of poor foam quality and stability and which are undesirably sticky. Moreover, many of these formulations are lacking in hair holding, hair feel or hair conditioning characteristics.It would be desirable to provide a non-aerosol, hair
