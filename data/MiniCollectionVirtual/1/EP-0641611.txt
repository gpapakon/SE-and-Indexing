<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of super-critical
fluids to clean substrates, and, more particularly,
to a process and apparatus employing a liquefiable gas,
such as liquid carbon dioxide, in combination with ultrasonic
cavitation to provide high cleaning efficiency for
general degreasing and particulate removal without the
need for expensive high pressure equipment.Ultrasonic cleaning has been utilized by industry for
a number of years. In the conventional processes, the
sonicating media are organic solvents, water, or aqueous
solutions, and ultrasonic energy is applied to the
media to promote cavitation, i.e., the formation of bubbles
and their subsequent collapse. Although usually
quite adequate for the removal of undesired contamination,
both types of solvents have disadvantages. Many
substrates require a rigorous drying process following
exposure to an aqueous medium, and this is often a
time-consuming thermal excursion. The use of organic
solvents as sonicating media presents the problem of
chemical disposal and is subject to strict regulatory controls.
An additional disadvantage relates to handling of
the removed contaminant(s), whether organic or particulate.
When the contaminant is a controlled material,
such as a radioactive particle, once in solution or suspension,
its volume is substantially increased, and this
presents an additional pretreatment/disposal problem.A respective conventional cleaning system using an
organic solvent is known from document US-A-5,193,560,
on which the preamble of daim 1 is based.
This document discloses an apparatus for removing
undesired particulates and contaminants from a major
surface of a chosen substrate comprising an enclosed
cleaning chamber in a walled vessel for containing a liquid
and the substrate containing the undesired particulates
and contaminants. The substrate is immersed in
the liquid and supported within the cleaning chamber.
An ultrasonic energy-producing transducer means is
attached to the walled vessel within the cleaning chamber
and applies ultrasonic energy to the liquid. Furthermore,
termperature control means for controlling the
temperature within the chamber and reservoir means
for providing fluid to the cleaning chamber are connected
to the cleaning chamber.In these conventional ultrasonic cleaning processes,
transducers are often used to produce the sonic
energy. In other processes, a cavitation nozzle may be
used. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,906,387, issued
March 6, 1990, to J. Pisani for "Method for Removing
Oxidizable
