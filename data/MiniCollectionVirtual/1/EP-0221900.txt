<ABSTRACT>
A method of breaking up bundles of adherent hardfibers, particularly steelfibers and feeding the obtained single fibers to a mixing device. The method comprises vibrating said bundles of adhering fibers on an oscillating screen to obtain separated fibers, passing said separated fibers being aligned in a plane parallel to the plane of said screen through oblong openings of said screen, through which openings in the main only one fiber at a time can pass and supplying by means of gravity and oscillating force said individual fibers to said mixing device spread over a large area, said area being larger than the area of said screen. The screen (4) has oblong openings (8) having a length corresponding mainly to the length of the fibers and a width being essentially less than the length of said fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
A method of breaking up bundles of adherent hard fibers and an oscillating screen.DescriptionThis invention is concerned with a method of breaking up bundles of adherent hard fibers, especially steel fibers, and feeding said defibered or individualized fibers to a mixing device and a vibrating screen for performing said method.It is previously known to admix precut steel fibers with mixed concrete, thereby the fibers have been added to the concrete mix in a concrete mixer. However, such fibers can only be contained in such concrete mix up to a few percent by volume, since the fibers during mixing and transport show a tendency to clog and form clusters with ballast and cement materials.It has been proposed to feed the fibers to the dry cement and ballast materials by an air stream. This method is very advantagously. However, steel and other metal fibers are sold only as precut fibers having a short length. These fibers are packed closely together and form lumps or bundles, the fibers of said bundles stick very hard together and are difficult to separate to individulized fibers.Swedish laid open patent application No. 7508720-5 discloses a method and a device to break up the bundles of fibers by vibrating and/or tumbling on a screen and/or in a tumbler. The feed rate of the fibers to the mixer is varied by an increase or decrease of the rate of motion of the screen or tumbler and/or the discharge opening of the tumbler. The fibers are oriented in a plane by falling by gravity on a vibrating table and thereafter aligned by an airstream in a transport pipe.The purpose of the present invention is to suggest a simple method of defibering fibers obtained as bundles and of supplying the individualized fibers by gravity directly to a mixing device without the intermediate orientation in a plane on a vibrating table and later alignÂ¬ ment. The invention also comprises a screen for performing said method.The purpose of the invention is achieved by a method according to the preamble of claim 1 in that bundles of adhering fibers are vibrated on an oscillating screen in order to individualize said fibers, said separated fibers are passed through oblong openings of the screen, that said fibers before being passed through said openings are aligned in a plane parallel to the plane of the screen by said vibrational movement, the openings have such a shape that mainly only one fiber at a time can pass through one and the same opening, and that by means of gravity and oscillating force said individualized fibers are
