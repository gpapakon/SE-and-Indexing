<ABSTRACT>
Method for checking and adjusting the geometry of the shaft line of a hydroelectric unit with vertical axis, the said unit being supported by a pivot, characterised in that:   - the bearings of the shaft line (3, 4, 5) are removed so as to allow free rotation of the shaft line; - for each shaft (3, 4, 5), in two different horizontal planes, the position of the centre of the shaft in the plane in question is determined for several angular positions of the shaft, the respective angular positions of the shaft being all aligned in one and the same vertical plane for all the measurement planes; - the path followed in each plane by the centre of the shaft located in this plane is determined; - the envelope of the trajectories of the centre of the shaft over the entire length of the latter is determined by calculation; and - the defects of the shaft and, optionally, the adjustments to be made are calculated.

Method for checking and adjusting the geometry of a line of shafting of
a vertically axed hydroelectric unit, which is supported by a pivot,

characterized in that:

the bearings (8, 9, 10) of the line of shafting (3, 4, 5) is dismantled,
so as to permit a free rotation of the line of shafting,
for each shaft (3, 4, 5), determination takes place in two different
horizontal planes of the position of the centre of the shaft in the considered

plane for several angular positions of the shaft, the respective
angular positions of the shaft all being aligned in the same vertical

plane for all the measurement planes,
determination takes place in each horizontal plane of the trajectory
followed by the centre of the shaft located in said plane,
determination takes place by calculation of the envelope of the
trajectories of the centre of the shaft over the entire length of the

latter and
a calculation is made of the defects of the shaft and possibly the
settings to be made.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 1, characterized in
that, for each shaft, the two measurement planes are separated by a distance

equal to at least 30% of the shaft length.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the position of the centre of the shaft is measured for eight angular

positions of the latter.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 1, characterized in
that, for each angular shaft measurement position, several measurements

are performed and the mean value of said measurements is determined.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 1, characterized in
that at least one of the measurement planes is level with the tongue of a

bearing (8, 9, 10) and/or a coupling plate.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the shaft (3, 4, 5) is slowly turned and in that the measurements are 

performed during the rotation in a synchronous manner for the different
measurement planes.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 6, characterized in
that the shaft (3, 4, 5) is manually rotated.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the shafts (3, 4, 5) are uncoupled and the checking and adjustment of

the upper shaft (3) take place, the following shaft (5) is mounted on the
upper shaft (3) and the checking and adjustment of the assembly take place,

said operations being repeated until all the shafts of the line of shafting
have been checked and adjusted.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 1, characterized in
that there is an abutment device limiting the radial displacements of the

line of shafting.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 9, characterized in
that said abutment device is constituted by a buffer.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 9, characterized in
that said abutment device is constituted by a bearing.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the measurement of the position of the centre of the shaft takes place

by means of two fixed comparators (20, 21) arranged with respect to the
shaft with an angular clearance of 90Â°.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 12, characterized in
that, for each measurement plane, the two comparators (20, 21) are connected

to an electronic storage and measurement control device (22) and in
that each of said electronic storage devices (22) is controlled by a

synchronization device (23) incorporating a device (24) for detecting the
angular position of the shaft.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 13, characterized in 
that the device (24) for detecting the angular position of the shaft is of

the optical type.
Checking and adjustment method according to claim 14, characterized in
that on the shaft are placed vertical adhesive tapes (25) forming a contrast

with the surface of the shaft and in that said optical device (24)
is placed in front of the shaft level with said tapes.
