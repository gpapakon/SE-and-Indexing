liquid fuel booster rocket motors (4), six transverse thrust rockets (5) mounted in the fuselage on a rotatable ring (6), solid fuel 

rocket motors (7 and 8) to provide emergency braking and additional acceleration respectively, a payload compartment (9), the 
crew's compartment (10), and a tail assembly with two vertical struts (11), a lower stabilizer (12) and an upper stabilizer (13).

rear wheel (21). The crew's compartment (10) is situated between the two upright struts (11) below the upper stabilizer (13). 

The spacecraft is provided with a orbital manoeuvering system whose final control elements are low thrust motors (22, 23) 
and gyrodines. The escape system comprises a separate compartment (24) designed as a ballistic re-entry capsule and secured 

to the aft end of the fuselage. The capsule (24) is linked to the crew's compartment (10) by means of a passage (25) which is 
provided with a system for getting the crew from their compartment (10) into the capsule (24). The capsule (24) is provided 

with hatches at the front and rear ends, an aerodynamic braking system ad a parachute system. The front part of the capsule

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to space engineering and more specifically to 
reusable spacecraft providing crew escape in case of emergency while in orbital flight. One state-of-the-art single-stage reusable aerospace vehicle is known to comprise 
a fuselage incorporating a crew cabin and a payload compartment, a landing gear, a 
variable-sweep wing, a vertical tail, a power plant, an orbital maneuvering system, and 
a crew escape system (cf "Novosti zarubezhnoi tekhniki" (Novelties of science and 
technology abroad) Aerospace and rocket engineering, 1988, No.13 Issued by the 
Joukovski Central aerodynamic institute, Moscow, p.p..3-4 (in Russian). One more state-of-the-art single-stage reusable aerospace vehicle is known to 
comprise a fuselage provided with a crew compartment, a payload compartment, and 
a center conical body, a landing gear incorporating a multiwheel bogey and a nose 
wheel, a variable-sweep wing, a power plant, an orbital maneuvering system with final 
control elements, and a crew escape system with an escape module (cf. the 
newspaper "Za rubezhom" (News from abroad),Moscow,1986,No.27(1356)pp.12-14(in 
Russian). In the aforementioned known single-stage reusable aerospace vehicles the 
fuselage internal volume is used inadequately efficiently for payload stowage due to 
accommodation of the power plant in the vehicle fuselage. Said vehicles require a 
substantially longer runway for taking-off and landing; the vehicle has a low climbing 
rate because its climbing is effected only due to wing lift. In addition, the heretofore-known 
constructions of aerospace vehicles are not provided with a crew escape  
 
system in case of emergency while in an orbital flight; they are inadequately 
maneuverable in an orbital flight; their movability over the airfield of a home airdrome 
is restricted. One prior-art crew escape system of a single-stage reusable aerospace vehicle, 
comprising an escape module and an ejection mechanism of said escape module. 
The escape module is provided with means for crew accommodation, life support, 
power supply, as well as an alighting gear incorporating an aerodynamic decelerator 
and a parachute landing system provided with soft landing engines (cf. "Novosti 
zarubezhnoi tekhniki" (Novelties of science and technology abroad) , Aerospace and 
rocket engineering, 1988, No.13, Issued by the Joukovski Central Aerohydrodynamic 
institute,Moscow,pp.12-14 (in Russian). The aforementioned crew escape system is applicable only in the atmosphere, 
that is, during
