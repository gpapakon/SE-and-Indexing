<ABSTRACT>
A system for integrating a plurality of call center 
agent subsystem modules to assist a call center agent in 

efficiently responding to customer calls includes a 
workstation that has a central processing unit for 

interfacing the call center agent with a call 
distribution system. Within the workstation, there are a 

plurality of modules that are integrated in a way that 
significantly improves the call center agent's ability to 

provide completely responsive and efficient service to 
customers. The integrated modules of the present 

invention deliver at a single place under the control of 
the call center agent voice, data, and images by which 

the agent can completely service a customer call.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to telecommunications
systems and, more particularly, to a method and system
for integrating a plurality of call center agent
performance enhancement modules that improves the ability
of a call center agent to interface with a
telecommunications system, to assess his or her own
performance in responding to calls, and that makes
accessible to the call center agent a plurality of host
applications in a rapid and easy-to-use manner. In a customer call center, a call center agent communicates with customers
through both in-bound and out-bound calls. This communication is through a voice
connection to a telephone switch that the call center agent controls from a workstation.
At the workstation, the call center agent typically uses a variety of instruments to
interface with application modules to obtain necessary information for the call center
agent to service the customer, monitor and record certain statistics relating to the call
center agent's performance, and display images or hard copies of documents relating
to the customer's account. Additionally, the call center agent uses a variety of
interfaces with host data processing systems and internal communication systems at
the call center to properly respond to the customer calls. At a bare minimum, the call
center agent uses separate telephone instruments to service voice transactions and a
personal computer or similar computer device to process data transactions. This
makes responding to a high volume of calls essentially prohibitive. If there were a
way that a call center agent could avoid having to use so many different sources of
information to respond to customer calls, the overall efficiency of the call center agent
would improve. This efficiency improvement could cause significant cost reductions
in the daily operation of a customer call center.The document "Teaming Switches and Computers for Customer Applications",
C.F. Ford, AT&T Technology, Vol. 6, No. 4, New York, 1991, pages 32-38, describes
a system for integrating call-control functionality into a computerised environment.
The system permits both incoming and outgoing calls to be controlled from a computer
terminal
running applications in a call-center agent workstation, including computer applications that can monitor
and control calls to provide the information which a call-center agent needs to handle the call. This improves
the productivity of call-center agents and results in the call-center efficiency being increased.A further system is described in
