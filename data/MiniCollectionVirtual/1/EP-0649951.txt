<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a concrete shuttering, e.g. floor-border shuttering or joist shuttering, having a shuttering angle which exhibits a vertical profile (2) and a horizontal profile (1) which can be laid on the upper surface (5, 7) of a load-bearing member (6, 8), and having a fastening device (9) for fastening the shuttering angle on the load-bearing member. The invention consists in the fact that the fastening device (9, 26) exhibits a clamping connection with two legs (10, 11, 26) which can be pressed in a frictionally locking manner, by means of a bracing device (17, 34), onto the two side surfaces (19, 29) of the load-bearing member (6, 8).

A configuration having a mold angle and an attachment
device for this mold angle for concrete molds, e.g. a

ceiling edge mold or a ceiling joist mold, wherein the
mold angle, in its operating position, has a vertical

section (2) and a horizontal section (1) which can be
placed onto the upper surface (5, 7) of a support (6, 8)

with a compression beam connecting these two sections to
each other which travels in a diagonal direction,

characterized in that the attachment device (9, 26) has
a clamping connection between two legs (10, 11, 26)

which can be pressed into frictional connection on the
two side surfaces (19, 29) of the support (6, 8) by

means of a clamping device (17, 34).
Mold according to claim 1, characterized in that the
attachment device exhibits two legs (10, 11, 26)

connected to each other by means of a yoke (12, 30),
whereby the pivotal points of the legs (10, 11, 26) on

the yoke (12, 30) are separated from each other.
Mold according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the ends of the legs exhibit protrusions (15) on the

surfaces facing the side surfaces (19, 29) of the
support (6, 8).
Mold according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the attachment device is fashioned
by means of a separate clamp (9). 
Mold according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the yoke (12) of the clamp (9) is
formed by a spring.
Mold according to one of the claims 1 to 3, whereby the
vertical section (2) of the mold angle exhibits a

U-shaped cross section, characterized in that the legs
(26) of the U-cross section are extended beyond the

engagement position (27) of the horizontal section (1)
in a downward direction and are movable against each

other at least along their extended portions and in that
a tensioning device (34) is provided for by means of

which these extensions can be pressed onto the side
surfaces (29) of the support (8).
Mold according to claim 6, characterized in that the
legs (26) of the U-shaped cross section of the vertical

section (2) can be guided in a manner in which their
heights are adjustable.
Mold according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that
the yoke portion (21) of the U-cross section of
 the
vertical section (2) exhibits a protrusion (31) which

projects inwardly into the cross section and the leg
(26) exhibits a slot (33) which is penetrated by a

tensioning device (34).
Mold according to one of the claims 6 to 8,

characterized in that the legs (26) are adapted to be
spring-like at least at the ends extending past the

engagement position (27) of the horizontal section (1).
Mold according to one cf the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the horizontal section (1) of the

mold angle exhibits a plurality of openings (20) for the
acceptance of attachment means which penetrate into the

support (6, 8) in the installed state of the mold angle.
Mold according to one of the preceding claims 10,

characterized in that the horizontal section (1) is
profiled on its lower side.
Mold according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the edges (23) of the legs of the
U-section of the vertical section (2) engaging the mold

exhibit perpendicular angled edge strips (23).
Mold according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that the edge of the cross sectionally
U-shaped vertical section (2) facing the mold including,

if appropriate, the edge strips (23) are slanted at an
inner surface (25).
