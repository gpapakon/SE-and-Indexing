<ABSTRACT>
New molded pulp and molded fiber interior package cushioning (IPC) structures (10, 47, 70, 85, 105, 125, 150, 170) provide cushioning to protect products in a package. The IPC structure (10) defines a product-receiving cavity (12), reinforcing structural ribs (15, 16, 18), crushable structural pods (22, 25, 28). The ribs are in the form of elongate hollow ridges and include intersecting ribs (16, 18) extending in orthogonal directions. The ribs are distributed around the cavity to absorb energy in response to mechanical shock to prevent damage or breakage to the product. Other IPC structures include rows of pods (20), fillets (30), podded ribs (26), anti-hinge ribs, stacking ribs (26), shelves (32, 34, 35), corner protectors, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to interior package
cushioning (IPC) structures for protecting products shipped
in a package from mechanical shock caused by corner drops,
edge drops, face drops and horizontal impacts of the
package, and from vibrations imparted by different transport
modes during shipping and distribution. The invention
provides new molded pulp fiber IPC structures which replace
plastic foam interior package cushioning material. The IPC
structures are molded with new crushable cushioning
structures in new geometrical configurations designed to
absorb impact shocks, critically damp vibrations, resist
bending and hinging, support and direct loading and stacking
forces around product containing cavities, and generally
cushion and protect products shipped in a package. The
molded pulp fiber IPC structure invention provides improved
interior package cushioning characteristics in comparison
with conventional plastic and plastic foam structures and
conventional molded pulp fiber structures.The predominant interior package cushioning material
currently used in the packaging of products for shipping and
distribution is plastic. Such plastic cushioning materials
include a variety of polyethylene foams, moldable
polyethylene copolymer foam, expanded polyethylene bead
foam, styrene acrylonitrile copolymer foam, polystyrene
foams, polyurethane foams, etc. Such plastic materials and
plastic foams may be molded in place or molded to specific
interior package cushioning structure shapes. The plastic
may be formed in pieces to provide loosefill. Sheets of
plastic film may be bonded together encapsulating bubbles of 
air to provide cushioning material. Such plastic interior
package cushioning materials are described for example in
Brandenburg and Lee, Fundamentals of Packaging Dynamics, MTS
Systems, P.O. Box 24012, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55424
(1985), Singh, Charnnarong, and Burgess "A Comparison
Between Various Package Cushioning Materials", IOPP
Technical Journal, (Journal of the Institute of Packaging
Professionals) Winter 1992 issue, pages 28-36, and U.S.
Patents 5,096,650 and 4,792,045.There are two major disadvantages associated with
plastic cushioning materials and plastic interior package
cushioning structures. Disposable packaging is a major
contributor to the nation's municipal solid waste. It is
estimated that packaging constitutes approximately one third
by volume of all municipal solid waste and 8% of this amount
is made up of the cushioning materials. The plastic
cushioning materials are generally
