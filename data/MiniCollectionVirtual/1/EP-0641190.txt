<ABSTRACT>
An oral hygiene composition comprises an effective amount of an antimicrobial agent in the form of a particulate non-ion-exchanging support material combined with a metal source providing antimicrobial metal ions in use. Preferably the antimicrobial agent is particulate titanium dioxide coated with silver chloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oral hygiene composition providing
sustained antimicrobial action. There is also provided inter alia the use of
such a composition in the treatment or prevention of dental caries or gingivitis
and in the cleansing of the mouth for cosmetic purposes.The term 'oral hygiene composition' as used herein means a dentifrice.The use of antimicrobial agents in oral hygiene compositions is
well-known in the art. Typically, the anti-microbial agent is an organic species
such as chlorhexidine, bromochlorophene, cetyl pyridinium chloride or
benzethonium chloride. These agents are known to be effective against the
microorganisms associated with dental caries and gingivitis, such as the
bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius, and the fungus
Candida albicans.It is also known to use metal ions, such as silver, copper and zinc ions,
as antimicrobial agents in medicine, dentistry and in water purification.In an oral composition, however, such organic and inorganic
antimicrobial agents present the problem that they are readily displaced from
the mouth, and thus from their intended point of action. For example, they
may be washed out of the mouth by saliva or adsorbed onto food at
mealtimes. Accordingly, their oral antimicrobial action can rarely be
sustained over long periods.The present invention seeks to solve this problem by providing an oral
composition comprising an antimicrobial agent with a tendency to remain in 
the mouth in use, thus giving sustained antimicrobial activity and enhanced
protection against dental caries and gingivitis.JP-A-03002113 (Sanpo Seijaku KK) discloses a dentifrice comprising an
antimicrobial metal, such as copper, silver or zinc, carried on a zeolite. The
dentifrice is stated to be storage-stable.JP-A-02283312 (Sanpo Seijaku KK) discloses a toothbrush having
brush-hairs incorporating a bactericidal metal-carrying zeolite, the metal being
carried on the zeolite by ion-exchange. The toothbrush is used for brushing
teeth and gums.EP-A-0251783 (Johnson Matthey PLC) discloses an antimicrobial
composition comprising an antimicrobial silver compound deposited on a
physiologically inert oxidic synthetic material. The synthetic material is
particulate, has an extended surface area, and may be selected from oxides of
titanium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, cerium, zirconium, hafnium, niobium
and tantalum as well as calcium hydroxyapatite and barium sulphate. The
antimicrobial compound is described as being suitable for topical use, for
impregnat
