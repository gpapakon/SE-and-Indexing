<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises 
inter alia
 a gradient coil system (3) for 
generating gradient fields in a measuring space (35), a power supply source (7) for the 

gradient coils, and a communication system for transferring acoustic information from 
at least a first region (39) in which the level of sound generated by the gradient coils (3) 

(gradient noise) is comparatively high to at least a second region (41). The 
communication system comprises means (55) for generating a reference signal which is 

dependent on the gradient noise, a microphone (43) which is arranged in the first region 
(39) so as to pick up a mixture of sound information and gradient noise, and a sound 

reproduction device (65, 67), at least a part of which is situated in the second region 
(41). The communication system also comprises a noise suppression device, comprising 

a filter device (61) for converting the reference signal into a signal which corresponds 
substantially to the gradient noise at the area of the microphone (43), and a summing 

device (63) for adding the output signal of the filter device to the output signal of the 
microphone in phase opposition, the output of the summing device being connected to 

the sound reproduction device. Between the microphone (43) and the summing device 
(63) there are inserted signal delay means (53) which delay the microphone signal for a 

predetermined period of time. The sound reproduction device (65, 67) is provided with 
means (69) for attenuating sound which does not originate from the sound reproduction 

device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus, comprising a
magnet system for generating a steady magnetic field in a measuring space, a gradient coil
system for generating gradient fields in the measuring space, a power supply source for the
gradient coils, and a communication system for transferring acoustic information from at least
a first region in which the level of sounds generated by the gradient coils (gradient noise) is
comparatively high to at least a second region, which communication system comprises means
for generating a reference signal which is dependent on the gradient noise, a microphone
which is arranged in the first region so as to pick up a mixture of sound information and
gradient noise, a sound reproduction device, at least a pan of which is situated in the second
region, and a noise suppression device which comprises a filter device for convening the
reference signal into a signal which corresponds substantially to the gradient noise at the area
of the microphone, and a summing device for adding the output signal of the filter device to
the output signal of the microphone in phase opposition, the output of the summing device
being connected to the sound reproduction device.US-A-5 033 082 discloses a communication system with active noise
cancellation which is suitable for various applications, one of the feasible applications
mentioned being an application in a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus. As is known,
during operation the gradient coils in such an apparatus produce an annoying noise which
strongly impedes the communication between a patient being examined in the apparatus and
personnel around the apparatus. The known communication system is capable of improving
this situation, but it has been found that the result still is not optimum. For example, when the
gradient coils are activated in a non-periodic manner (for example, in the case of quickly
changing preparatory gradients, a non-linear profile sequence, changing slice orientations), the
noise cancellation device cannot follow the noise signals caused by the gradient coils, so that
the noise cancellation is either lacking or very incomplete. Moreover, in the second region
disturbing noise may occur which is not compensated by the known device and which, in
conformity with the cited document, requires a separate noise cancellation device which
renders the overall device substantially more complex and expensive. It is an object of the invention to provide a magnetic resonance imaging
apparatus of
