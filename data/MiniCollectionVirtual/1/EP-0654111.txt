<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a structural component for glazing with laminated safety glass panes (1) using glass attachments (5, 6; 10) for at least one supporting plate (12) for drilled glass panes with tolerance compensation and securing means fitting therewith. This component is characterized by at least one pane (1) and struts (2) stretched beneath it and secured to it at an acute angle to the plane of the pane by glass attachments (5, 6; 10) and a supporting strut (4) at the junction of the two struts which is also secured to the pane by a glass attachment (6). The struts (2, 4) are secured to the pane via the glass attachments positively and adherently in such a way that tensile and compressive stresses can act on the struts (2), the supporting strut (4) and the pane (1).

Constructional element for glazing building structures with 
glass sheets (1) made of laminated safety glass using glass 

retaining elements (5, 6; 10) with at least one support 
plate (12) for glass sheets provided with holes with 

tolerance compensation as well as fixing means interacting 
with these, characterized by at least one glass sheet (1) 

and under-spanning struts (2) which are connected with the 
glass sheet by means of glass retaining elements (5, 6; 10) 

and which act against the plane of the glass sheet at an 
acute angle, and by a support strut (4) located at the 

connection point of the two struts, said support strut also 
being connected with the glass sheet by means of a glass 

retaining element (6), whereby fixing of the struts (2, 4) 
with the glass sheet by way of the glass retaining elements 

is designed in the form of a positive and non-positive 
connection such that the under-spanning struts (2), support 

strut (4) and glass sheet (1) are capable of being 
subjected to tension and pressure forces. 
Constructional element in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that the non-positive and positive 

connection between the glass sheet and glass retaining 
elements is produced by completely filling a still existing 

space between the edges (16) of the holes in the glass 
sheets (1) and a threaded bolt (22) inserted through the 

glass retaining elements with a plastic (24) with limited  
 

flowability, whereby the final hardness of said plastic 
after the end of polymerization is lower than the hardness 

of the glass sheets. 
Constructional element in accordance with claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that a second support plate (21) provided 

with a screw bolt (22) is used as a fixing element in 
conjunction with the glass retaining elements, whereby the 

screw bolt can be screwed into a hole in the first support 
plate (12). 
Constructional element in accordance with claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that one neoprene ring (26) in each case 

with a Shore hardness of around 80 is located between the 
support plates (12, 21) and the glass panes (14, 15) 

forming the glass sheet (1). 
Constructional element in accordance with claim 4, 
characterized in that silicone rubber rings (27) with a 

Shore hardness of approx. 40 are located between the 
support plates (12, 21) and the glass panes (14, 15) 

forming the glass sheet and the two-component plastic (24) 
inside the neoprene rings (26). 
Constructional element in accordance with claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the threaded bolt (22) which 

penetrates the glass retaining element (10) is surrounded 
by a plastic sleeve (25) for the purpose of separation from 

the two-component plastic (24).  
 
Constructional element in accordance with claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a truncated-cone extension (17) is 

provided in the outer pane (14) of the glass sheet (1) 
consisting of two panes (14, 15) bonded together by means 

of an adhesive layer (23), whereby a correspondingly shaped 
plastic sleeve (28) is inserted in said extension, and in 

that a countersunk-head screw which passes through the 
sleeve is provided as a fixing element, whereby said screw 

can be screwed into the support plate (12). 
Constructional element in accordance with claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the inner pane (15) of the glass 

sheet (1) consisting of two panes (14, 15) bonded together 
by means of an adhesive layer (23) possesses a truncated-cone 

extension (19), into which a correspondingly shaped 
plastic sleeve (28) is inserted, in that a countersunk-head 

screw (20) which passes through only this plastic sleeve 
and this pane is provided as a fixing element, whereby said 

screw can be screwed into the threaded hole of the support 
plate (12), and in that the outer or top pane (14) of the 

laminated safety glass sheet (1) is bonded with the inner 
pane (15) by means of the adhesive layer (23) after fixing. 
Constructional element in accordance with one of claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that the connection of the under-spanning 

struts (2) with the glass sheet (1) by means of 
the glass retaining elements (5; 10) is located in areas of  

 
minimum deformation with homogeneous loading of the glass 

sheet (1).
