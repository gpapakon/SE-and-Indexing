<ABSTRACT>
In known cassettes for holding X-ray film, 
it is difficult to know whether there is film in the 

cassette without opening it, and if there is film in 
the cassette, whether that film has been exposed. 

Described herein is an improved X-ray film cassette 
having a base (14) and a cover (16) adapted to close 

upon the base (14). The cover (16) is provided with 
an identification window. A pressure plate assembly 

(20) is secured to the cover (16) of the cassette 
(10). The cover (16), pressure plate assembly (20) 

and base (14) form a light-tight space for receiving a 
sheet of X-ray film. The pressure plate assembly (20) 

is also provided with an identification window which 
is in substantial alignment with the identification 

window of the cover. A light-tight slideable window 
shutter is provided for covering of the identification 

window of the cover (16) and/or the pressure plate 
assembly (20). The slideable window shutter, when in 

a first position, provides a light-tight seal, and 
when in a second position, allows information to be 

provided to an X-ray film contained within the 
cassette. An indicator assembly is secured to the 

pressure plate and is at least partially visible 
through the cover for indicating when film is present 

within the cassette and for indicating when the window 
shutter has been opened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cassettes 
for holding photosensitive material. Still, more 
particularly, the present invention relates to a 
cassette for holding X-ray film. In the prior art it has been difficult, 
especially in connection with X-ray cassettes, to 
ascertain whether or not the cassette contains film 
without opening of the cassette. As a result of this 
inability, mistakes have often been made and either an 
empty cassette was used during an X-ray exposure, or a 
cassette was used more than once. In each instance, 
the intended X-ray had to be retaken, which is not 
only very wasteful with respect to time, but also 
exposes the patient to unnecessary amounts of 
radiation. The prior art has suggested the use of an 
indicator for identifying if the cassette contains an 
X-ray film. For example, US-A-4,248,172 and German 
Patent 825,947 disclose a small moveable button which 
is slideable between a first position wherein the 
button is flush with the exterior surface of the 
cassette, and a second position wherein the button was 
recessed from the exterior surface. If film is 
present, the button is prevented from falling into the 
second position and thus indicating the presence of 
film. Another common feature in X-ray cassettes is 
the patient identification window. Typically, this 
feature consists of an opening through the cassette 
which is covered by a light-tight slideable shutter. 
In use, the cassette is placed in the patient 
identification camera which establishes a light-tight 
seal against the cassette surrounding the window; 
opens the shutter; optically transfers patient 
identification information on to the X-ray film  
 
contained within the cassette; closes the shutter; and 
retracts the sealing means. It is also common in places where 
radiography is practiced in large volumes, such as in 
large hospitals, to provide machines which automate 
the unloading and reloading of X-ray cassettes. 
Typically, these machines are comprised of a light-tight 
chamber into which the X-ray cassette is passed 
or placed. The chamber contains a first mechanism to 
open the cassette and a second mechanism generally 
featuring a plurality of suction cups to pick up the 
film and remove it from the cassette. Such mechanisms 
often fail when the film, which has been pressed into 
intimate contact with the intensifying screen, sticks 
to the upper screen when the cassette is open and thus 
is not in the proper position to be picked up by the 
suction cup mechanism. Intensifying screens
