<ABSTRACT>
Box elements (4-104-204) made from extruded cellular 
sheets of polypropylene and/or other suitable waterproof 

plastic materials, filled if necessary, are disposed in the 
space between the metal lattices (3) projecting from the 

reinforced concrete slab (1-2) of a floor, and are fixed 
over the whole length of this space, with or without 

interruptions, and act as lightening elements. The box 
elements are downwardly open, are provided with transverse 

closing and stiffening walls (8) fixed by mortising and/or 
other suitable means and suitably distributed over the whole 

length of the said elements, which are preferably also 
provided with small lateral openings (7-10) which prevent 

the entry of the floor finishing casting but which allow the 
water to flow freely, so that after the setting of the said 

casting the floor no longer releases liquid components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to prefabricated floors, known 
as lattice slab floors. These products consist of a thin 
reinforced concrete slab in which are embedded the lower 
structures of the metal lattices, parallel to and 
equidistant from each other, in numbers variable according 
to the dimensions of the slab. There is a known method of 
disposing on the slab, in the space between the lattices, 
polystyrene blocks which, when the floor is in use, have a 
lightening function, replacing the concrete where this is 
not required to perform important static functions. However, 
the use of polystyrene has many disadvantages which may be 
summarized as follows. When used at high density, 
polystyrene is unacceptably expensive, and is undesirable 
because of the effects on fire safety owing to the 
considerable mass exposed to combustion. When used at low 
density, as is normally the case, it absorbs water which it 
then releases over an indefinite period, with serious damage 
to the plaster and any other elements associated with the 
floor. The polystyrene inserts have low mechanical strength, 
and may therefore fracture, thus changing the designed floor 
dimensions, while parts of these inserts may fall between 
the lattices and compromise the quality of the casting ribs. 
Owing to the considerable volume of the polystyrene blocks, 
these are expensive to transport to the site of use and 
present storage problems. Over a period, polystyrene waste  
 
causes considerable problems of a functional, aesthetic and 
ecological nature, especially since it is difficult to 
dispose of or reclaim. Other forms of lightening proposed up 
the present as alternatives to polystyrene, such as 
perforated brick blocks, lightweight concrete blocks, 
elements made of mineralized wood fibre mixed with concrete, 
and solid aerated concrete elements, are all of limited 
usefulness owing to the major operational restrictions 
which, for various reasons, each of them has. The invention is intended to overcome these 
restrictions and disadvantages of the prior art with the 
following idea for a solution. The lightening elements 
disposed on the floors consist of box elements made from 
cellular sheets of polypropylene and/or other suitable 
plastic materials, filled if necessary, which have 
considerable mechanical strength, which do not absorb water, 
and which in case of fire have a limited mass exposed to the 
flame and do not evolve toxic gases. The sheets of this 
material are prepared by the manufacturer with suitable 
shapes

box elements (4-104-204-304) are provided laterally with 

suitable drainage openings (7-10), appropriately distributed 
and such that the floor finishing casting cannot pass 

through them.

with an inverted "U" profile, and are provided by punching 

with suitable slots or slits (7), which are located at least 
in the lateral walls of the said structure, and in which may 

be inserted and fixed corresponding portions of transverse 
walls (8) also formed from cellular sheets of the said 

material and provided by punching with slots or slits (9) 
which can be engaged by parts of the said structure, the 

whole in such a way as to produce, a downwardly open box 
element, closed at the ends, and provided with a plurality 

of transverse walls which are vertical and/or inclined and 
are suitably distributed over the whole length, to improve 

the mechanical strength of the whole box element. 
Products according to Claim 5, in which the transverse 
walls of the lightening box elements (4-104-204) are 

provided in their lower with slits (10) which emerge from 
the prefabricated slab casting (1-2) to permit the complete 

outflow from the lightening box element of water from the 
floor finishing casting or from other sources. 
Products according to Claim 5, in which the inverted "U" 

 
structure (5-105-205) of the lightening box elements is 

provided on the lateral walls with downwardly open slits (7) 
into which are inserted the transverse walls (8) which in 

turn are provided in the portion inserted in the said slits 
with corresponding upwardly open slits (9) which are

of the said structure. 
Products according to Claim 7, in which the transverse 
walls (8) of the lightening box element (4-104-204) are 

provided at their perimeters and in one piece with one or 
more projections (11) of round, elliptical, diamond or other 

shape, capable of being inserted by pressure and fixed in 
corresponding slots (12) provided in the walls of the 

inverted "U" structure (5-105-205), or of being fixed in 
other ways to this structure, with stitches or other means, 

to form a secure and distributed connection which avoids any 
deformation of the said walls under the force of the floor 

finishing casting. 
Products according to the preceding claims, in which the 
transverse end walls (8) of the lightening box elements 

(4-104-204) may be integral with and joined to the ends of 
one of the walls of the portal structure (5-105-205) which 

forms the said box elements and may be installed with 
projections (11) and slots (12) or other suitable means. 
Products according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that when the lightening box element (4) is 

of considerable width it is made with two or more elements 
of lesser width, adjacent, and more able to withstand the 

stresses of the floor finishing casting. 
Products according to Claim 10, in which the adjacent 
 

lightening box elements (4), of limited width, used to form 
a single box element of considerable width more able to

Products according to any one or more of the preceding 
claims, in which the lightening box elements (4-104-204) are 

predefined and prefixed below to the slab (1-2) of the 
prefabricated floor, in the stage of prefabrication of this 

product. 
Products according to Claims 1 to 4, in which the

prefabrication of this product, and are completed on site, 

before the floor finishing casting, with the joining to the 
remaining parts which make up and geometrically define the 

said lightening box elements, the whole in such a way as to 
contain the costs of production of the prefabricated floor 

and to enable the said prefabricated floors to be packed on 
top of each other with limited overall dimensions during 

storage and transport, since the parts of box elements
