<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds that
are analogs of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and methods for
the synthesis of these compounds. More specifically, the analogs
according to the invention are useful as anti-seizure therapy for
central nervous system disorders such as epilepsy, Huntington's
chorea, cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease, tardive
dyskinesia, and spasticity, and, possibly as an anti-depressant,
anxiolytic, and antipsychotic activity.Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major
neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of brain neuronal
activity. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter (Roberts
E, et al, GABA in Nervous System Function, Raven Press; New York,
1976; McGeer EG, et al, Glutamine, glutamate, and GABA in the
Central Nervous System; Hertz L, Kvamme E, McGeer EG, Schousbal
A, eds., Liss: New York, 1973; 3-17).An imbalance in the concentration of such a
neurotransmitter can lead to convulsive states. Accordingly, it
is clinically relevant to be able to control convulsive states
by controlling the metabolism of this neurotransmitter. When the
concentration of GABA diminishes below a threshold level in the
brain, convulsions result (Karlsson A, et al, Biochem. Pharmacol
1974; 23:3053-3061). When the GABA levels 
rise in the brain during convulsions, seizures
terminate (Hayashi TJ, Physiol. (London)
1959;145:570-578). The term seizure as used herein
means excessive unsynchronized neuronal activity that
disrupts normal neuronal function. In several seizure
disorders there is concomitant with reduced brain GABA
levels a diminished level of L-glutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD) activity also observed (McGeer PO,
et al, In: GABA in Nervous System Function; Roberts E,
Chase TN, Tower DB, eds., Raven Press: New York
1976:487-495; Butterworth J, et al, Neurochem.
1983;41:440-447; Spokes EG, Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.
1978;123:461-473; Wu JY, et al, Neurochem. Res.
1979;4:575-586; and Iversen LL, et al, Psychiat. Res.
1974;11:255-256). Often, the concentrations of GAD and
GABA vary in parallel because decreased GAD
concentration results in lower GABA production.Because of the importance of GABA as an inhibitory
neurotransmitter, and its effect on convulsive states
and other motor dysfunctions, a variety of approaches
have been taken to increase the brain GABA
concentration. For example, the most obvious approach
was to administer GABA. When GABA is injected into the
brain of a convulsing animal, the convulsions cease
(Purpura DP, et al, Neurochem. 1959;3:238-268).
