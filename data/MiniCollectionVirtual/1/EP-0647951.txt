<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for use in determining the thickness of the insulated coating of an 
electrical cable manufactured in an extrusion process having means for 

generating an alternating current in the cable core coupled with means for 
detecting the magnetic field produced by the current flow in the cable such that 

in combination with a measurement of the distance from the detection means to 
the coated cable surface, a determination of coating thickness may be made.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the manufacture of electrical cables which in 
the main consist of a conducting core and insulation cover around the core, and 
particularly to meeting the requirement that in order for the final product to be 
acceptable for its desired application, the insulating jacket which covers the 
electrical conducting core should be of constant thickness all round the cable 
product. During the manufacture of electrical cables, a conductor such as a metallic wire 
or a plurality of wires may be introduced into an extrusion machine on a 
continuous basis. The extrusion machine is such that it applies a hot insulating 
jacket around the circumference of the wires, the insulation material being 
plastic, rubber and the like. Following the application of the hot plastic insulation sheath around the wire, 
the resulting cable is introduced into a cooling bath or trough in order to cool 
the sheath or jacket and the product is then taken up on a reel or drum. The resulting finished cable is one which is made up of a single or multicore of 
electrically conducting wires such as copper, aluminium and the like, totally 
surrounded by a jacket of insulating material.  
 The purpose of this cable construction is to provide a signal path such as for an 
electric signal, along the cable core with the jacket acting as an insulating 
barrier against any short circuiting of the cable to another cable. It is accepted that for various applications, a variety of thicknesses of jacketing 
is specified in order to fulfil certain electrical specifications. For example, if the cable is to be used for high voltage applications the 
insulating jacket would be of greater thickness than that applied to a cable for 
low voltage applications. Therefore, the amount of thickness of the jacket as well as the material of the 
jacket are contributory factors to the electrical characteristic requirements and 
breakdown voltage resolutions that are taken into consideration when a 
particular cable is manufactured. In addition to the above considerations there is a further very important 
consideration that must be taken into account when manufacturing a specific 
type of cable, namely that the thickness of insulation around the circumference 
of the cable core should be reasonably constant. The minimum wall thickness will be required to fulfil the electrical 
considerations mentioned above, but also it is important that although the 
minimum jacket thickness is applied a commercial consideration arises, so

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for use in determining the thickness of the insulated coating 
of an electrical cable manufactured in an extrusion process comprising means 

for generating an alternating current in the core of the cable, feedback means 
operating in the generator means for maintaining said current in the core 

constant, detection means for detecting the varying magnetic field around the 
cable as a result of the passage of said current and providing an output 

representative of the thickness of the coating in relation to the strength of the 
field and the distance of the detector means from the surface of the coating, and 

processing means responsive to said output for determining the thickness of the 
coating of the cable. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that the means for 
generating an alternating current in the core of the cable is comprised by a 

toroidal transformer core wound with a primary winding and positioned around 
the cable such that the cable forms the secondary winding of the transformer 

core. 
Apparatus as claimed in claims 1 or 2 characterised in that the detection 
means for detecting the varying magnetic field around the cable is comprised 

by a search coil with the output representative of the distance of the detector 
means from the core of the cable being provided in the form of an induced 

voltage appearing across the search coil terminals.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 characterised in that the search coil is 
housed in a structure which may be rotated around the coated electrical cable at 

right angles to the axis of the cable 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4 characterised in that the search coil 
housing is in physical contact with the outer surface of the coated electrical 

cable. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 characterised in that the contacting 
surface of the search coil housing is comprised of a ceramic, diamond or 

sapphire material. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4 characterised in that the coated 
electrical cable is guided by guiding means such as rollers, whose position 

relative to the search coil housing is known such that the distance of the 
detector means from the surface of the coating is again determined. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that first 
and second diameter gauge means are provided to -determine the respective 

diameters of the core of the cable and of the coated cable then outputting the 
diameter to the processing means to calibrate the same. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim characterised in that 
second feedback means are provided responsive to the output of the processing 

means to control the extrusion process as to ensure a centralisation of the core 
within the coated cable.
