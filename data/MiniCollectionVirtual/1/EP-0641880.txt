<ABSTRACT>
The elongate slots (3) are arranged in two series 
of intersecting helical alignments; on each of these 

alignments slots are arranged alternately with their 
greatest dimension along said helical alignment and 

transversely to it; at each intersection is a slot 
belonging to both alignments. When an axial compressive 

force is applied the slots shrink, thereby simultaneously 
reducing the axial and diametrical dimensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the present invention is a
centre which can be made of injection-moulded plastic, is
substantially tubular in shape and is designed to receive
yarn wound in turns; centres of this kind are intended to
undergo various processing operations and in particular
dyeing treatments using liquid dye which must penetrate
through the turns of the yarn in order to dye it in the
most uniform way possible; the spools of yarn wound on
the centres are consequently inserted in suitable dyeing
equipment in order to carry out the abovementioned
operation. In the case of certain yarns especially, the
yarn shortens when wetted and heated, which can give rise
to high tightening forces being exerted on the centre;
for these reasons, it is advantageous for the centre to
be able to undergo a reduction in its diameter i.e. in
its transverse section, in order to reduce the forces
exerted.by the yarn and especially to make these forces
substantially uniform even deep within the spool, so as
to ensure that the mass of yarn wound in turns is dyed in
a substantially uniform manner. Centres which allow this
reduction in transverse section, i.e. in practical terms
a reduction in diameter, are already known but these
known centres have certain drawbacks and in particular
considerable reduction in the area through which the
dyeing liquid can pass through the permeable walls of the
centre once it has undergone a reduction in diameter. A
further drawback of known centres of this type is that
the reduction in diameter often cannot be controlled and
can give rise to an excessive undesirable contraction
which can lead to additional problems.The US-A-3 759 461 (upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based) discloses a centre which does not offer mechanical resistance in a cold environment and even less at the dyeing temperatures (about 100° C and more).A recent type of centre (App. FI92U 102 of August 
28, 1992 and Ep Appl. no. 93830308.8 of July 20, 1993 & EP-A-587538) is
capable of a reduction in the diameter, i.e. the
transverse section of the centre, while maintaining a
large cross section of the holes that pass through the
tubular cylindrical wall of the centre even when its
diameter is reduced; it has, on its cylindrical wall,
adjacent longitudinal rows of slots which are elongated
lengthwise, the slots of one row being staggered -
generally by half a pitch - with respect to those of the
contiguous rows; in this way the longitudinal edges of
each slot can be brought closer together in the
intermediate zone, allowing a

Centre (1) made from injection-moulded plastic for
forming spools of yarn wound about it in turns for

processes such as dyeing in particular and for
subsequent distribution of the yarn, whose dimensions

can be reduced by mechanical pressure, said centre
having, on its cylindrical wall, rows of elongate slots (3)

which are disposed, with their greatest dimension,
according to two series of helical alignments oppositely

inclined and crossing each other, characterized in that
the central region of a slot (3) belonging to one of said

helical alignments belonging to a first of said series
lies between two adjoining slots of a helical alignment

belonging to the other of said series and vice versa and that each
elongated slot (3) exibits an arcuate profile joining the

two longitudinal edges thereof.
Centre according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the helical alignments intersect at approximately

90° with respect to each other.
Centre according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that it comprises, in an intermediate

position along at least one of the longitudinal edges of
at least some of the slots (3), a projection (5) which projects

into the slot and acts as a distance piece to limit the
coming together of the longitudinal edges in their middle

points.
Centre according to Claim 3, characterized in
that both the longitudinal edges of one slot have a

projection (5), the two projections (5) being opposite each
other.
Centre according to at least one of Claims 3 or 4,
characterized in that the projections (5) are thinner than 

the thickness of the wall (1) in which the slots (3) are formed,
and said projections (5) are set back from the outer surface

of the wall (1) of the centre.
