<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a device for measuring physical characteristics of an object (2) by determination of visual contrast values of its surface (6), comprising a closed casing (1) separated into two parts by a translucent plate (3) and capable of receiving the said object (2); the said casing isolates this object from any external parasitic light and includes a base (7), at the rear of the said object and of known white level, at least one device (4) for illuminating the said object (2) and a camera (5) placed on the side opposite this object (2) with respect to the said plate (3).   The said device includes at least two illumination devices, one (42) of which is placed behind the object (2) with respect to the said camera (5), so that the surface (6) of the object facing this camera is not illuminated by this first device (42), and the other (41) of which is placed on the same side with respect to the object (2) as the camera (5), so that it illuminates the said surface (6) of the object, and a device (18) for controlling the two said illuminations, supplying a single illumination at the same time and successively.
