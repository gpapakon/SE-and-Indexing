<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
hybrid inflators useful for inflating air bags and 
more particularly to a switch for sensing a low 
pressure condition within the hybrid inflator. United States Patent 4,049,935 is illustrative 
of one type of pressure switch that may be used in 
combination with the hybrid inflator which is 
incorporated herein by reference. The switch of 
U.S. Patent 4,049,935 is shown in FIGURE 1 herein 
and comprises a pressure vessel 1 sealed at an open 
end by a diaphragm 2, a pair of reinforcement 
members 3 and 4 to limit the motion of the diaphragm 
2. This pressure switch also includes a switch 
assembly 5 comprising electrical contacts 6 and 7 
and a moveable pin 8. The diaphragm 2 is moveable 
up and down in relation to the pressure differential 
acting thereacross. As can be appreciated, the 
inner surface of the diaphragm is exposed to the 
pressure of the gas within the pressure vessel 1 of 
the switch and the outer surface of the diaphragm is 
exposed to the local environment i.e. the pressure 
within the hybrid inflator 9 which in and of itself 
comprises a second pressure vessel filled with 
pressurized inflation gas. The hybrid inflator is 
used to inflate an air bag mounted in communication 
therewith in a known manner. The switch assembly 5 
is compressively loaded against other portions of 
the pressure switch during assembly. While not 
shown in FIGURE 1, it can be appreciated that if a 
mounting bracket end loads (see arrows 11) the  
 
pressure switch, this compressive loading will be 
increased. One deficiency of this type of switch is 
that the reinforcement members could become bowed 
because of the compressive loading moving the pin 8 
and diaphragm somewhat closer to the contact 6. The 
closer spacing permitted the pin to prematurely 
engage the contact 6 forcing same against contact 7 
giving rise to a false low pressure signal. FIGURES 
2 and 3 further explain this bowing movement using a 
similar switch arrangement. This switch is end 
loaded by a support bracket (not shown) to mount the 
pressure vessel 1 inside the hybrid inflator. The 
support bracket compressively loads the pressure 
vessel and switch assembly 5 axially as illustrated 
by arrows 11 as shown in FIGURE 2. As mentioned, 
this compressive loading may tend to cause the 
switch assembly to bow upwardly (see FIGURE 3) 
lifting the moveable pin 8. This phenomenon does 
not occur instantaneously and is time and force 
dependent causing creep of the plastic parts used in 
the switch

<CLAIMS>
A pressure switch (30) adapted to be placed 
within a pressurized chamber for generating a logical 

signal when the pressure within the chamber reduces to 
a determinable pressure P
1
, the pressure switch (30) 
comprising: 


a pressure vessel (32) sealed at one end (34) by 
a snap action diaphragm (40) and filled to a 

determinable pressure P
2
 less than the pressure P
1
 of 
the pressure chamber; 
inner stop means (42) and outer stop means (60, 
62) respectively positioned on opposing sides of the 

diaphragm (40) for limiting diaphragm motion, the 
inner stop means (42) comprising a flat plate having 

an opening (44) therethrough; 
the outer stop means comprising 
an arcuate top surface (62) conformed with 
the shape of the diaphragm when in its outward 

extending condition, characterized in that the outer 
stop means further includes 
a first cylindrical portion (78) below the 
top surface (62), a first pair of parallel slots (80a, 

b) formed therein and a through bore (70, 72, 74) 
extending therethrough and wherein the pressure switch 

further includes 
a switch assembly (90) comprising an upper 
housing member (92), a lower housing member (94), 

first and second electrical contacts (96a, 96b) and an 
activation pin (98); 
the upper housing member (92) comprising a hollow 
cylindrical portion (100) adapted to be slid over 

first cylindrical portion (78) including a second pair 
of opposing slots (112a, b), the first and second  

 
cylindrical portions (78, 100) are loosely secured 

together by a clip (150) fitted within the first and 
second pair of slots (80a,b; 112a,b), the upper 

housing member further including opposingly positioned 
first and second notches (110a,b) and two sets of 

outwardly extending, oppositely positioned locating 
pins (108a-d); 
the first electrical contact including a first 
contact portion and an extending first crossbar having 

first openings near each end thereof, the first 
contact portion received through a first one of the 

notches of the upper housing member and the openings 
of the first crossbar received about a first set of 

locating pins; 
the second electrical contact (96b) including a 
second contact portion and an extending second 

crossbar having second openings near each end thereof, 
the second contact portion received through a second 

one of the notches (110a,b), the second openings 
received about a second of the sets of locating pins, 

the second electrical contact spaced from the first 
electrical contact, 
the activation pin (98) loosely received through 
the through bore (70, 72, 74) and lightly biased by 

the first electrical contact (96a) against the 
diaphragm (40), the pin (98) moved by the diaphragm 

against the bias of the first electrical contact to 
separate the first electrical contact from the second 

electrical contact (96b). 
The device as defined in Claim 1 wherein the 
first and second notches (110a,b) are off-set one to the other.  

 
The device as defined in Claim 1 wherein the 
lower housing member (94) includes a plurality of pin 

receiving openings for receipt of the first and second 
set of location pins (108a,b,c,d), and upwardly extending flanges (144a,b) 

which fit into the first and second notches (110a,b) to pinch 
the first and second electrical contacts (96a,b) therebetween.
