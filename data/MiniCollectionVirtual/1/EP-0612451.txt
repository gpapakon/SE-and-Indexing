<ABSTRACT>
An optical system superposes an optical carrier with modulation and an additional optical carrier. The system is designed in such a way that it supplies the superposed optical signal with modulation at one of its outputs and the superposed optical signal without modulation at an additionnal output. The generator is designed in such a way that it is as insensitive as possible to ambient influences. The optical signal without modulation constitutes the feedback signal for the frequency/phase control of the laser emitter. The optical signal with modulation is available for further processing, for example in a beam shaping network.
