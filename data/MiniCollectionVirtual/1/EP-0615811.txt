<ABSTRACT>
A clamping and releasing device with a tie rod contains a mechanism which is acted upon by disc springs and moves the tie rod. The mechanism contains a sliding sleeve which is acted upon by the disc springs and is provided with cam surfaces on the opposite front edge. Cams of a rotatable, wedge-like mechanism part act on the cam surfaces in order to rotate this mechanism part. The mechanism part has the developed shape of a wedge and increases the distance between two elements which are likewise of wedge-shaped design. Movement of the tie rod is thereby achieved.
