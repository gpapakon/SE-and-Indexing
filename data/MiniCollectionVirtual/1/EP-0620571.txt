isotropic and is provided with a high saturation magnetic flux 

density and an anisotropy of high magnetic permeability, so 
that it is suitable for the various magnetic head at a high 

production yield.

magnetic layers made of Fe-M-N component alloy or Fe-M-B-N 
component alloy are laminated through a non-magnetic insulating 

layer on a bias-applied substrate by means of a 
sputtering and are provided with a high magnetic permeability 

which direction is different from both neighboring soft 
magnetic layers through the magnetic insulating layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soft magnetic multilayer film unit for a magnetic
head or core material of a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus such as
a video cassette recorder (VCR), an audio recording and reproducing apparatus and a
magnetic recording apparatus for a computer.In response to the requirement of the high recording
density in a recent magnetic recording technology, much
attention has been paid to the development of a magnetic head
having a superior performance.In order to satisfy the requirements mentioned above, various
types of magnetic heads are known from EP-A-0 584 768 filed in the name of the
applicant of the present application claiming priority of 24 August 1992 and having
a filing date of 24 August 1993 and a publication date of 2 March 1994: One
example as known from EP-A-0 584 768 and shown in Fig. 10 is a magnetic head of a laminated-type
head having a ring shape in which the core material is
made of an integrated layers of a soft magnetic film 17 and
an electric insulating film 18 integrated alternately to each
other and is sandwitched between a pair of non-magnetic
substrates 19. The core material forms a magnetic path. 20
denotes a glass material and 21 a magnetic gap.Another example as known from EP-A-0 584 768 and shown in Fig.12 is a magnetic
head (referred to as MIG head) in which the majority of the
magnetic path is composed of ferrite material 22 and at the 
vicinity of the magnetic gap 23 easily saturated magnetically
there is provided with a soft magnetic film 24. 25 denotes a
glass material.In the case of the laminated type head of Fig.10, there is
shown a contacting surface in Fig.11, while in the case of MIG
type head according to Fig.12 there is shown a contacting surface in Fig. 13.In the magnetic heads, the performance thereof
relates closely to the material characteristics of the core
material. In order to achieve a high recording density, it is
necessary for the core material to have a high saturation
magnetic flux density (related mainly to the recording
characteristics) and a high magnetic permeability (related
mainly to the reproducing characteristics).In spite of the above requirements, the soft
magnetic film made of a conventional Permalloy, Sendust, Co-based
amorphous alloy can achieve a high saturation magnetic
flux density as low as 1T more or less and can not realize the
high density recording because of their limited high saturation
magnetic flux density.Therefore, much attention has been paid to the development of the soft magnetic
