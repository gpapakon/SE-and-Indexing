<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided whereby radiation curable compositions 
comprising N-vinylformamide and an oligomer selected from the group 

consisting of epoxy-acrylate resins, polyester acrylate resins, 
polyurethane acrylate resins, acrylic acrylate resins, silicone acrylate 

resins, unsaturated polyester resins, maleate ester resins, vinyl ether 
resins and mixtures thereof are applied to the surface of a substrate and 

subsequently exposed to a radiation source until an adherent dry 
polymerized film is formed on the substrate. These compositions are useful 

for a wide range of applications including pigmented and unpigmented 
coatings, printing inks, adhesives and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the formulation and applications of 
radiation curable compositions suitable for use as pigmented or unpigmented 
coatings, printing inks, adhesives and other applications. EP-A-0 559 135 relates to a radiation curable formulation comprising: 
(a) an oligomer selected from the group consisting of epoxy-acrylate resins, 
polyester acrylate resins, polyurethane acrylate resins and mixtures thereof; and (b) N-vinyl formamide. Radiation curable acrylic oligomers are usually comparatively high 
viscosity species and require to be blended with a monomer in order to 
produce a radiation curable formulation of the appropriate viscosity for 
any particular application. Such oligomers generally fall into three broad 
groups of resin, namely epoxy-acrylates, polyester acrylates and 
polyurethane acrylates. The epoxy-acrylates include the B-hydroxy esters which are generated 
by the reaction of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with an epoxy resin or 
epoxy-novolak resin. The polyester acrylates consist of polyesters which 
have been esterified with acrylic acid to yield a polyester with acrylate 
ester terminal groups, using well established esterification techniques. 
The polyurethane acrylates consist of reaction products of a hydroxy-containing 
acrylate ester, usually 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate or hydroxy 
propyl acrylate with an isocyanate prepolymer. The monomers which are blended with the above acrylic oligomers in 
order to yield a practical radiation curable formulation in the presence of 
a suitable photoinitiator fall into three groups defined by functionality, 
and may be mono-, di- or poly-functional. Poly-functional monomers, usually with a functionality of 3 or 4, 
generally consists of acrylate esters of tri or tetra-functional alcohols.  
 
Commonly used materials include glycerol triacrylate, trimethylol propane 
triacrylate, trimethylol ethane triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetracrylate, 
together with the acrylates of the ethoxylates or propoxylates of the above 
alcohols. Di-functional monomers consist usually of the acrylate esters of 
ethylene glycol or propylene glycol and their oligomers, with tripropylene 
glycol diacrylate being especially preferred, diacrylates of longer chain 
alcohols such as hexanediol diacrylate and acrylate esters of cycloaliphatic 
diols such as the cyclohexane diols. Mono functional monomers consist of the acrylate esters of mono 
functional alcohols such as octanol, nonanol, decanol, dodecanol, tri 
decanol and hexadecanol both in
