<ABSTRACT>
The fixed-point fastening exhibits an insertion shell (7) which has at least one circumferential groove (11) on the inside. The shell (7) is laid around a press fitting (3) of a pipeline (1) such that a flange (5) of the fitting (3) engages into the groove (11) and a positively locking connection between the shell (7) and the pipeline (1) is thus formed. The fixed-point fastening is suitable, in particular, for pipelines (1) comprising composite pipes (2) with a comparatively small external diameter. The shell (7) of the fixed-point fastening may also be used for a sliding fastening.

<CLAIMS>
Pipeline and locating point fastening for this 
pipeline (1) on a building wall (17), having a pipe clamp 

(14), into which a shell (7) is inserted and which, at a 
distance from the building wall (17), engages around the 

pipeline (1) with the inserted shell (7), characterized 
in that the pipeline (1) has a press fitting (3), to 

which a composite pipe (2) with a press joint is fastened, 
and in that, for the purpose of axially fixing the 

shell (7) to the pipeline (1), the shell (7) at the 
compressed location (2a) is placed around the said 

pipeline such that an internal, encircling groove (11) of 
the shell (7) surrounds a flange (5), which extends 

radially outwards, of the press fitting in a positively 
locking manner, it also being possible to place the shell 

(7) against the pipeline (11) as a slide fastening at a 
distance from the press fitting (3). 
Pipeline and locating point fastening for this 
pipeline according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 

shell (7) has two grooves (11) on the inside, the flange 
(5) engaging into one of these two grooves. 
Pipeline and locating point fastening for this 
pipeline according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 

the groove (11) is arranged at the edge of the inside 
(12) of the shell (7). 
Pipeline and locating point fastening for this 
pipeline according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 

in that the shell (7) has an encircling recess (13) on 
its outside, to accommodate the pipe clamp (14). 
Pipeline and locating point fastening for this  
 

pipeline according to Claim 4, characterized in that the 
recess (13) is of step-like form, viewed in cross-section. 
Pipeline and locating point fastening for this 
pipeline according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 

in that the shell (7) comprises at least two parts. 
Pipeline and locating point fastening for this 
pipeline according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 

in that the shell (7) comprises two halves (8), which are 
connected to one another by means of at least one integral 

hinge (9). 
Pipeline and locating point fastening for this 
pipeline according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 

in that the shell (7) can be connected by means of a 
snap-in closure (18, 19) to form a circular ring.
