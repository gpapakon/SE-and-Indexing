<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the control of pressure difference, the apparatus being suitable in particular for the control of the operating condition of a filter by monitoring the pressure difference between its inlet and outlet sides. The apparatus includes a mechanical part which comprises a frame (6), a piston (5) moving relative to the frame, a spring (3) loading the piston, a magnet (4) linked to the piston, and communicating passages (15, 16) for coupling a pressure difference between the ends of the piston in such a manner that the pressure difference will act on the piston against the load caused by the spring. In addition the apparatus comprises an electric element (19) for measuring the intensity of the magnetic field produced by the magnet and for providing a signal at a piston position corresponding to a predetermined threshold value. The essential idea of the invention is that the apparatus has, as a longitudinal extension to the mechanical part, an electrical part which includes the said element (19) measuring the intensity of the magnetic field and which is equipped with leads relaying the signals arriving at and leaving the apparatus, the leads being oriented in a direction transverse to the apparatus, and that the electrical part is linked to the frame (6) of the mechanical part rotatably in such a manner that the direction of departure of the said leads can be adjusted by a rotational movement between the said parts. The electrical part may also include a memory component, a signaling device, and a means (20) monitoring the temperature of the pressure medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for the control 
of pressure difference, the apparatus comprising a mechanical 
part consisting of a frame, a piston moving in relation to the 
frame, a spring loading the piston, a magnet linked to the 
piston, and communicating passages for coupling a pressure 
difference between the piston ends in such a manner that the 
pressure difference acts on the piston, and on a magnet moving 
together with it, against the load produced by the spring, and 
the apparatus additionally comprising an electric element for 
measuring the intensity of the magnetic field created by the 
magnet and for providing a signal at a piston position corresponding 
to a predetermined threshold value. For example the operating condition of filters is controlled by 
monitoring the pressure difference. An increase in the pressure 
difference between the inlet and outlet sides of a filter is an 
indication of the clogging of the filter, and at a certain 
stage an indication of a need to replace the filter cartridge. 
Examples of filters the operation of which requires such monitoring 
include oil filters in hydraulic systems and filters for 
fuels and lubricants. From FI Lay-Open Print 66693 there is known in particular a 
pressure indicator, connectable to a filter, in which a pressure 
difference is effective between the ends of a springloaded 
means equipped with a magnet, and against this means 
there is fitted an indicator means, also equipped with a spring 
and a magnet, which is held in place by the mutual pull between 
the magnets, working against the spring force. When the pressure 
difference increases, the first-mentioned means pushes 
away from the indicator means, whereby the mutual pull between 
the magnets which are gaining distance from each other respectively 
weakens, and at a certain point the spring force of the 
indicator means exceeds the mutual magnetic pull with the  
 
result that the indicator means, forced by the spring, shifts 
to the indicating position. The shift is thus a signal of an 
increase of the pressure difference to a level which requires 
replacement of the filter or other maintenance steps. The above-mentioned prior-art indicator has the deficiency that 
the exceeding of the predetermined pressure difference limit 
can be observed visually only at the point to which the indicator 
is fitted. Relaying the signal to another place or converting 
it to another form would require additional devices 
which would make the indicator with already
