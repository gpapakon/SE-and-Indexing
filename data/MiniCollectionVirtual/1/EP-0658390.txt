<ABSTRACT>
A metal carrier for supporting 
an exhaust gas cleaning 

catalyst for automobiles, motorcycles 
and industrial machines, and 

a method of manufacturing the 
same. In this carrier, a metal 

honeycomb core is press fitted in 
an outer metal cylinder, and the 

bonded portions of flat and corrugated 
members, which constitute 

the metal honeycomb core, consist 
of solder applied to the apex 

or ridge portions of the corrugated 
members in a spotted manner or in 

the form of a plurality of stripes 
or lines. The thickness of the solder 

at the bonded portions of the 
flat and corrugated members is not 

more than 100 µm, and the positions 
of the bonded portions of the 

outer and inner surfaces of each of 
the flat and corrugated members 

differ from one another. Moreover, these bonded portions are provided via a non-bonded portion extending from an 
exhaust gas introduction side end surface of the metal honeycomb core as much as a length of not less than 5 % of 

a total length of the honeycomb core. This carrier is further characterized in that the bonded portions of the outer 
circumferential surface of a metal honeycomb core and the inner circumferential surface of an outer metal cylinder 

are in the form of a plurality of stripes or belts, or such that the bonded portions of the outermost flat and corrugated 
members of the metal honeycomb core and those of the outer metal cylinder are not aligned with each other with the 

metal honeycomb core and outer metal cylinder bonded together intermittently in both the axial and circumferential 
directions. The method of manufacturing such a metal carrier is characterized in that an outer metal cylinder and a 

metal honeycomb core are combined with each other by press fitting the latter in the former in such condition that the 
slurry type solder applied to the apex portions of the corrugated members is kept in a fluidized state with the solder 

applied to the inner surface of the outer metal cylinder not kept in a fluidized state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an exhaust gas cleaning metal
carrier according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a method
for producing the same according to the preamble of claim 4 as
well as to a solder material coating apparatus.In more detail, the invention relates to a metal carrier
for carrying an exhaust gas cleaning catalyst for automobiles,
autobicycles, and industrial equipment, and a production method
thereof.As a catalyst carrier for cleaning exhaust gas of
automobiles, a honeycomb-formed metal carrier comprising
heat-resistant stainless steel is known. The metal carrier
is formed by winding round a stack of a flat plate and a
corrugated plate to form a honeycomb core body and joining
the outer periphery of the honeycomb core body and inner
surface of a metal outer cylinder.Various methods are known as the production method of
the metal carrier. For example, Japanese Patent Publication
63-44466 describes a metal carrier in which a pile of a flat
plate and a corrugated plate is wound round, and the
vicinity at least one of end faces of the wound honeycomb
core body is soldered. However, such a metal carrier, when 
actually used on an internal combustion engine for
automobile, tends to undergo deformation of the honeycomb
core body or breakage of a foil on an outer periphery of the
honeycomb core body due to thermal fatigue by heat cycle of
heating and cooling. In particular, the exhaust gas inlet
side of the honeycomb core body undergoes considerable cell
deformation and foil breakage because it is exposed to
high-temperature exhaust gas. Further, the metal carrier
may be broken at the joined portion due to engine vibration
and vibration during travelling.Further, JP-A-56-4373 corresponding to US-A-4 521 957
discloses an exhaust gas cleaning metal carrier according to
the preamble of claim 1 in the form of a honeycomb core body
produced by a method in which solder
is coated on a flat steel plate or at peaks of a corrugated
steel plate through a supply roller from a vessel filled
with liquid solder paste, and the former is wound round with
a corrugated steel plate, or the latter is wound round with
a flat steel plate. The patent also discloses a honeycomb
core body produced by a method in which before coating
solder, an adhesive is coated at a position to be solder
coated through a supply device, and wound round while
sprinkling a powder-formed solder material by a distribution
device. In these honeycomb core bodies, the powder-formed
solder material is piled in layers between the flat steel
plate
