<ABSTRACT>
A container with a lid both consisting of plastic material are of oval or 
similar shape with substantially semi-circular short sides (6) and long 

sides (8) which are straight or have a large radius of curvature in 
relation to the radius of curvature of the short sides. The edge portion 

of the lid has a peripheral edge flange which encloses an edge portion 
positioned at the mouth of the container and at its surface facing this 

edge portion has an inwardly directed continuous projection for releasably 
retaining the lid to the container. The downwardly directed edge flange of 

the lid is between the short sides and the long sides divided by means of 
vertical slots (40) for providing edge flange sections (36, 28) at the 

short sides and the long sides which are separated from each other. Above 
the inwardly directed projection the edge flange sections of the short 

sides have a hinge which allows that the projection is at the edge flange 
sections of the short sides displaced from the retaining position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container with a lid, the
container as well as the lid consisting of plastic material.Containers of different kinds and for different purposes, for
example plastic containers for paint, food stuffs and so on are
usually closed by means of a lid of plastic material, the lid
being forced over the edge portion of the container, Thereby it
is usual that the edge portion of the lid has a continuous,
downwardly directed edge flange enclosing the edge portion at
the mouth of the container and having at its surface facing the
edge portion an inwardly directed, continuous projection which
for releasably retaining the lid to the container engages below
a downwardly facing engagement surface of said edge portion of
the container.Especially at such containers which have an oval shape or the
like, i.e. containers in which the mouth portionof the container
and the lid have substantially semi-circular short sides
and long sides which are straight or have a large radius of
curvature in relation to the short sides it is a problem to design
the lid and the edge portion of the container so that the
lid tightly closes the container but in spite thereof is easily
removable when the container shall be opened.In DE-U-88 00 906 there is described a container with a lid,
both consisting of plastic material, in which the edge portion
of the lid has a peripheral, downwardly directed edge flange
enclosing an edge portion at the mouth of the container. At its
surface facing the edge portion the edge flange has an inwardly
directed, continuous projection engaging beneath a downwardly
facing engagement surface on the edge portion of the lid for
releasably retaining the lid to the container. Above the
inwardly directed projection there is arranged a hinge provided
by material reduction allowing that the projection is displaced
out of engagement with the downwardly facing engagement surface
of the edge portion of the container by pivoting the edge portion
of the edge flange section below the hinge outwardly
around the hinge in order to make it possible to remove the lid
from the container. In order to make it more easy to pivot the
edge portion of the edge flange section of the lid so that the 
projection thereof is displaced out of engagement with the
downwardly facing engagement surface of the edge portion of the
container the peripheral, downwardly directed edge flange of
the lid is according to DE-U-88 00 906 divided by means of vertical
slots.The object of the invention is to provide a container

<CLAIMS>
A container with a lid, both consisting of plastic materiral,
the mouth portion of the container (2) and the lid (4)

being of oval or similar shape with substantially semi-circular
short sides (6) and long sides (8) which are straight or have a

large radius of curvature in relation to the short sides, the
edge portion of the lid having a peripheral, downwardly directed

edge flange (36, 38) enclosing an edge portion (14) at the
mouth of the container and having at its surface facing the edge

portion (14) an inwardly directed, continuous projection
(46) engaging beneath a downwardly facing engagement surface

(22) on the edge portion of the lid for releasably retaining
the lid to the container, the edge flange sections of the short

sides having above the inwardly directed projection a hinge
(50) provided by material reduction and allowing that the projection

is at the edge flange sections of the short sides
displaced out of engagement with the downwardly facing engagement

surface of the edge portion of the container by pivoting
the edge portion of the edge flange sections of the short sides

positioned below the hinge outwardly around the hinge, and the
peripheral, downwardly directed edge flange of the lid being

between the short sides and the long sides at least below the
projection (46) divided by means of vertical slots (40),


characterized
 in that the vertical slots (40) divide
the edge flange sections (38) of the short sides which

have a hinge provided by material reduction from the edge
flange sections (36) of the long sides which are formed without

a hinge provided by material reduction.
A container with a lid according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the edge portion of the edge flange sections
(38) of the short sides positioned beneath the hinge (50)

form bistable locking flanges (52) which are adapted as a preparation
to the removal of the lid from the container to be pivoted

upwards to a stable position in which the projection at
the edge flange sections of the short sides is substantially

out of engagement with the downwardly facing engagement surface
of the edge portion of the container. 
A container with a lid according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that the edge flange
(36, 38) of the lid forms an outer wall of a downwardly open

peripheral recess sealingly receiving the edge portion positioned
at the mouth of the container.
A container with a lid according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that the edge portion
(14) of the container is formed by an upwardly extending wall

portion having a free upper edge surface and a radially outwardly
directed lip (20) which at its outer edge forms the

downwardly facing engagement surface (22) of the edge portion
of the container.
A container with a lid according to claim 4, 
characterized

in that the radially outwardly directed lip (20)
at the long sides of the container and the edge flange sections

at the long sides of the lid are provided with engagement means
(28, 48) which are positioned above the inwardly direction projection

of the lid and the downwardly facing engagement surface
of the edge portion of the container and are provided releasably

to restrict outwardly directed deflection of the edge
flange sections (36) of the long sides to a position in which

the inwardly directed projection is out of engagement with the
downwardly facing engagement surface.
A container with a lid according to claim 5, 
characterized

that the engagement means are constituted by an
upwardly directed projection (28) on the radially outwardly directed

lip (20) and a downwardly directed projection (48) on
the edge flange of the lid.
A container with a lid according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterized
 in that the slots (40) are
between the edge flange sections provided with sealing means

(42) adapted to be broken as a consequence of the pivotal movement
of the edge flange sections of the short sides.
