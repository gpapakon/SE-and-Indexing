<ABSTRACT>
A current limiting method and apparatus for preventing fault overload in a utility power transmission system (10) employs a high power, superconducting coil based pulse transformer (36) for saturating the core of the utility power transformer (30) thereby limiting its current carrying capacity. The utility transformer core (54) is biased to a disadvantageous portion of its B-H curve. A fault condition is detected and as a result the superconducting coil (48) is quenched thereby sending a high energy pulse of current into the utility transformer magnetic core (54). The core, while heating, does not exceed its capability to maintain a stable thermal condition while at the same time limiting the current being transformed from its input (32) to output (34) lines, until a transformer circuit breaker activates.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CURRENT LIMITERS IN POWER UTILITY APPLICATIONSBackground of the InventionThe invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for reducing the size of utility company switch gear and protecting the sensitive components, such as generators and transformers used by power utilities, and in particular, to a current limiting method and apparatus for controlling the current through such generators and transformers during a fault condition.In the utility industry, to protect current sensitive components such as generators and transformers, the utilities typically use passive current limiters without the ability to trigger upon the occurrence of a fault. Accordingly, these limiters limit the current only to values which are ten to one hundred times higher than the normal operating values for the equipment.Since the expense and size of switch gear used by the utilities increases rapidly with fault current ratings, the utilities prefer to use the smallest switch gear which is commensurate with the application. The addition of fast operating current limiters, with tight overload specifications, would allow the utilities to split a high current bus without the requirement of using switch gear on each sub-bus which tolerates a high fault current. For these split-bus services, typically, for example, 240kV, 4 kA lines, to operate successfully, the fault currents need to be limited to three or four times the normal load current. Thus, a limiter operating for 30 or 40 milliseconds, on a 240kV line, must be able to sustain a 75-100 MJ energy load per fault.When a fault occurs, for example a short circuit, the current through the current sensitive components can rise to fault values in less than 1 millisecond. Accordingly, a current limiter to be effective must be able to hold the current to less than several times normal values for at least about 30 milliseconds while the line circuit breaker 

/01909-2- operates. The line circuit breaker, while effective to decouple the fault from the current sensitive components, will not "kick in" for about 30 milliseconds once the fault occurs.In the past, there have been two forms of current limiters used in utility power systems. These are inductive limiters and current limiting fuses. The current limiting inductors are air core inductors, having an inductance (L), placed in series with a circuit breaker. They limit current by generating a back voltage (V) , due to the changing current (i), as a function of time (t) according to Lenz's and Faraday's laws:V = -L t (Eq. 1)The
