<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to oral compositions for 
desensitising sensitive teeth. By using potassium tartrate 

as desensitising agent in the manufacture of oral 
compositions for desensitising sensitive teeth, a 

composition with improved desensitising properties is 
obtained. In a preferred embodiment the compositions also 

contain a zinc salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oral composition for 
desensitising sensitive teeth. More particularly, it 
relates to the use of potassium tartrate as desensitising 
agent in the manufacture of an oral desensitising 
composition. Tooth hypersensitivity is a problem that affects many 
people. People suffering from tooth hypersensitivity 
experience a painful reaction when the teeth are exposed 
e.g. to hot, cold, sweet, acid, pressure and the like 
stimuli. They may experience this painful reaction 
particularly when the normal protective enamel sheathing 
of the teeth is damaged or when the gums have receded, 
exposing tooth dentine. The present invention has as its object to mitigate the 
problem of sensitive teeth by using an effective amount of 
potassium tartrate as desensitising agent in the 
manufacture of an oral desensitising composition. According to the present invention, potassium tartrate is 
used as desensitising agent in the manufacture of an oral 
composition for use against sensitive teeth. Several potassium salts such as potassium nitrate, 
potassium citrate, potassium oxalate, potassium chloride or 
potassium bicarbonate have been proposed as desensitising 
agents in oral compositions. US-A-3 863 006 discloses the 
use of potassium nitrate as a tooth desensitising agent. 
Potassium citrate has been disclosed in European Patent 
Application No. 0 095 871 to be effective to reduce the 
pain associated with sensitive teeth. Potassium oxalate has 
been disclosed in US-A-4 057 621. The use of potassium 
chloride and potassium bicarbonate has been similarly 
disclosed in International Patent Application WO 85/04098.  In US-A-4 656 031, Example 5, Table VI a toothpaste with 
1.01% potassium tartrate is described. The purpose of the 
use of this ingredient is, however, entirely different from 
that according to the present invention; it is used 
according to this reference to adjust the lamellar spacing 
of the liquid lamellar crystal surfactant phase in 
toothpastes. Finally, Maita et al in a Poster, POS 20, presented for an 
IADR/AADR Satellite Symposium on 14-16 March 1993 in 
Georgia, USA, have reported on the effects of i.a. a 30% 
potassium tartrate solution on the permeation of magnesium 
ions through radicular dentine in extracted bovine teeth, 
and found that this potassium tartrate solution did not 
significantly reduce the permeation of magnesium ions 
radicular dentine. The potassium tartrate is used according to the present 
invention in an effective amount. This amount ranges from

<CLAIMS>
Use of an effective amount of potassium tartrate as 
desensitising agent in the manufacture of an oral 

desensitising composition. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
potassium tartrate is used in an amount of 0.2-10% by 

weight, calculated on the oral composition. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the oral composition further comprises a zinc salt.
