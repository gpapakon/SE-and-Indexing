<ABSTRACT>
A container (1) for pumpable and free-flowing masses (17) consists of a sack-like bag (3) arranged in a receiving frame (2) and made of flexible, diffusion-tight plastic film which is closed in a pressure-tight manner. A line (11) extends from the lower region (9) of the bag (3) from the removal opening (10) thereof, which can also be the filling opening, to which line (11) a suction line (13) can be coupled. When removing mass (17) from the bag (3), the latter is raised progressively higher by hoisting gear (16). As a result and under the effect of the reduced pressure prevailing inside the bag (3) the bag (3) assumes a pear shape becoming increasingly slimmer. As a result, the mass (17) accumulates in the region of the orifice of the line (11) and the mass (17) can be removed completely from the bag (3) without difficulty and without air entrapment. In order to support and protect the bag (3) laterally when it is full, the receiving frame (2) has a wall (5). The bottom (5) of the receiving frame (2) has a central depression (20) from whose lowest point the line (11) extends. By means of a valve (14) provided in the bag (3) at the top, air can be pumped out of the bag (3) while it is being filled with mass (17) and/or while mass (17) is being removed.
