<ABSTRACT>
A modular housing for a circuit breaker has first and second opposed 
side panels which engage one another at respective upper and lower 

edges defined by transversely extending flanges. The mated flanges 
define the upper and lower edges of the housing. When assembled, the 

side panels define an enclosure with front and rear openings, with 
grooves on the inner edges of the openings which receive tongues of 

respective modular front and rear panels of the circuit breaker housing. 
The front panel has an opening through which an operating lever 

protrudes when the housing is assembled, and the operating lever pivots 
on formations on the inner surfaces of the side panels. The modular 

construction of the circuit breaker housing allows different front and 
rear panels to be fitted to a common shell. For example, a range of 

circuit breakers having different operating handles and different terminal 
configurations can be provided at a relatively low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a modular housing for a 
circuit breaker, the housing having opposed side surfaces, opposed top 
and bottom surfaces, and opposed front and rear surfaces, and 
comprising: 
   first and second opposed side panels adapted to engage one 
another at respective opposed upper and lower edges and to 
define an enclosure for the circuit breaker mechanism, 
so that the side panels 
define the opposed side surfaces of the housing and the engaged 
upper and lower edges define the top and bottom surfaces (see for example DE-A-1 588 270). The modular housing according to the invention is characterized in that said first and second opposed side panels further define openings of the front and rear of the enclosure, and in that the housing comprises 
a modular front panel securable in the opening at the front of the 
enclosure to define the front surface of the housing; and  a modular rear panel securable in the opening at the rear of the 
enclosure to define the rear surface of the housing. Each one of the first and second side panels may have transversely 
extending flanges formed at the respective opposed upper and lower 
edges thereof arranged to mate with respective opposed flanges of the 
other side panel, the flanges being formed with complementary engaging 
formations at their edges.  
 The outermost edge of each flange may be formed with an edge zone of 
reduced thickness, so that the mating edges of opposed flanges overlap. Each side panel may have engaging formations formed on its inner front 
and rear edges for engagement with complementary formations on the 
edges of the modular front and rear panels, to retain the front and rear 
panels in position. Preferably, the engaging formations on the inner front and rear edges of 
the side panels are grooves, and the complementary formations on the 
edges of the front and rear panels are tongues. Each side panel may have a retaining formation formed on an inner 
surface thereof, adjacent to a front edge thereof, for receiving a 
projection of an operating lever of the circuit breaker so that the lever 
is retained pivotably in the housing between the retaining formations. The modular front panel may have an opening therein through which the 
operating lever protrudes when the housing is assembled. Preferably, the side panels, the front panel and the rear panel are 
moulded from a tough plastics material. At least one of the front panel and the rear panel may be formed from 
a material which is different from the material from which the

<CLAIMS>
A modular housing for a circuit breaker, the housing having 
opposed side surfaces (10, 12), opposed top and bottom surfaces (14, 16), and 

opposed front and rear surfaces (18, 20), and comprising: 

first and second opposed side panels (22, 24) adapted to engage 
one another at respective opposed upper and lower edges 

and to define an enclosure for the circuit breaker 
mechanism, so 

that the side panels (22, 24) define the opposed side surfaces of 
the housing and the engaged upper and lower edges 

define the top and bottom surfaces (14, 16); characterized in that 
said first and second opposed side panels (22, 24) further define openings at the front and rear of the enclosure, and in that the housing comprises 
a modular front panel (44; 116; 118) securable in the opening at the 
front of the enclosure to define the front surface (18) of the 

housing; and 
a modular rear panel (46; 96; 102; 106) securable in the opening at the rear 

of the enclosure to define the rear surface (20) of the housing. 
A modular housing according to claim 1 wherein each one of the 
first and second side panels (22, 24) has transversely extending flanges (26, 28; 30, 32) 

formed at the respective opposed upper and lower edges thereof 
arranged to mate with respective opposed flanges (26, 28; 30, 32) of the other 

side panel (22, 24) , the flanges (26, 28; 30, 32) being formed with complementary 
engaging formations at their edges. 
A modular housing according to claim 2 wherein the outermost 
edge of each flange (26, 28; 30, 32) is formed with an edge zone of reduced 

thickness, so that the mating edges of opposed flanges (26, 28; 30,32) overlap.  
 
A modular housing according to claim 2 or claim 3 wherein each 
side panel (22, 24) has engaging formations formed on its inner front and 

rear edges for engagement with complementary formations on the 
edges of the modular front and rear panels (44, 46) , to retain the front 

and rear panels (44, 46) in position. 
A modular housing according to claim 4 wherein the engaging 
formations on the inner front and rear edges of the side panels (22, 24) 

are grooves (66, 68), and the complementary formations on the edges of 
the front and rear panels (44, 46) are tongues (54, 56). 
A modular housing according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein 
each side panel (22, 24) has a retaining formation formed on an inner 

surface thereof, adjacent to a front edge thereof, for receiving a 
projection of an operating lever (52) of the circuit breaker so that the 

lever (52) is retained pivotably in the housing between the retaining 
formations. 
A modular housing according to claim 6 wherein the modular 
front panel (44) has an opening (50) therein through which the operating 

lever (52) protrudes when the housing is assembled.
