<ABSTRACT>
A hinged knee brace has one or more inflatable pads mounted 
thereon to adjustably provide secure and confortable support for the 

brace against the leg. Each pad is a pneumatic bladder having a 
valve enabling selective inflation or deflation of the bladder with a 

fluid to systematically adjust the fit of the brace to the leg in 
accordance with the needs of the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an orthopaedic brace, and 
particularly to an orthopaedic brace having a pad mounted thereon 
for supporting the brace against the body of a user. More 
particularly, though not exclusively, the present invention relates to 
an orthopaedic brace having one or more pneumatic pads mounted 
thereon that support the brace against the body in close fit therewith 
by selectively inflating or deflating the one or more pads in 
correspondence to the body. Orthopaedic braces are commonly employed on the body of a 
user to stabilise a skeletal joint that has been weakened by injury or 
other infirmity. The braces characteristically have either rigid or 
elastic structural components supporting the joint. Typically, the 
structural components of rigid braces are dynamically linked 
together by hinges enabling controlled movement of the joint during 
rehabilitative therapy or routine user activity. Such braces are 
positioned on the body so that the hinges traverse the joint being 
stabilised, while the rigid components are secured to the body along 
a plurality of engagement faces above and below, as well as 
adjacent to the joint. Substantially solid elastomeric pads or fluid-filled 
pneumatic pads are often positioned on the brace between the 
body and the rigid support components to enhance the fit of the 
brace with the body and to cushion the body of the user from the 
engagement faces. Despite the placement of pads on rigid braces, the user 
frequently experiences discomfort from painful point loads while 
wearing a closely-fitted padded brace because of the high forces 
the brace applies to the body across the engagement faces during 
routine activity or rehabilitative therapy. Such discomfort is 
particularly acute where the pad does not possess proper 
compression characteristics or the brace is not properly sized and 
configured in conformance with the structure of the brace and the 
contours of the body. It has also been found that body tissue 
undergoes transient changes, such as swelling or shrinkage, during 
routine or rehabilitative physical activity for which pads employed in  
 
rigid braces are not configured and consequently to which such 
pads do not readily adjust. U.S. Patent 4,201,203 discloses an elastic knee brace having 
an open-loop, elastomeric pad conformable to the patella. U.S. 
Patent 4,777,946 similarly discloses an elastic knee brace having a 
closed-loop, elastomeric pad conformable to the patella. U.S. Patent 
4,378,009 and U.S. Patent 4,938,207
