<ABSTRACT>
A bag type device (2) for extracting water from oil includes a bag (3) with an outer layer of felt (20) lined by at least one layer (22) of water absorbing laminate. The interior of the bag is composed of a plurality of slit sheets of water absorbing laminate forming a plurality of finger-like strips (35) depending from adjacent the top of the bag. The strips are preferably longer than the length of the bag. The bag and the water-absorbing layers within the bag are supported by a wire ring (30) stitched into a hem around the open upper end of the bag. As oil is passed through the bag, the finger-like strips provide an increased surface area for absorption of water from the oil. The strips can expand inwardly and toward the oil flow to prevent back-pressure build up within the bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a filter, and more specifically, to a bag-type
water absorbing element for extracting water from oil.A machine requires oil to lubricate the various moving parts within the machine.
Without proper lubrication, the machine may not perform properly and may
prematurely wear. This can lead to a shorter life span for the machine and increased
maintenance costs. When a foreign fluid, such as water, enters the oil, the lubricity
and other properties of the oil may be detrimentally affected. Manufacturers may not
warrant a machine if too much residual water is present in the lubricating oil. It is,
therefore, important to keep the machine properly lubricated with oil which is free of
or contains only very low levels of water.It is not always possible, however, to keep the oil dry. Machines, such as can
seamers used in the brewing and canning industries, are routinely hosed down and
steam-cleaned. These machines are also often subjected to changing temperatures
which can cause moisture to accumulate on or within the machine. Water may leak
into the interior components of the machine and enter the oil supply.In addition to adversely affecting the lubricity of the oil, as little as 1% residual
water in the oil may cause several other problems. Even within an oil environment,
water can lead to rust which severely impairs precision parts such as gear mechanisms
and bearings. Moreover, the water may lead to hydrogen embrittlement of metal
which causes metal particulates to break away and cracks to form. The particulates 
may act as abrasive grains in the machine and limit its performance. Furthermore,
water molecules can enter the cracks and form additional rust centers within parts of
the machine.When specialized types of oil compounds having anti-wear and other additives are
used to lubricate the machine, water dispersed in the oil can react with the zinc, e.g.,
used in many of such oils. The product of this reaction is a metal soap which can clog
valves and other precision machine components. Furthermore, the water oxidizes the
antifoam and stabilizer packages present in the oil which may reduce the viscosity of
the oil, and lead to friction wear between adjacent moving parts.Due to the detrimental effects described, the lubricated machines will have to be
serviced more frequently, leading to undue system shutdown events and increased
costs. Many of these effects can be prevented by providing a system for extracting
dispersed water from the lubricating oil.Various devices and

A device (2) for removing a contaminant liquid
from a carrier liquid, the device comprising a porous bag

(3) having a closed bottom and an open top with which is
associated a bag support (30), and characterised by

contaminant-sorbing material (22, 24, 26)

fully covering the inner surface of the bag, at
least a portion of that material being present in the bag

as discrete bodies (26) of the material which are free to
move toward the interior of the bag in response to

enlargement of the bodies due to sorption of contaminant

liquid by the bodies (26).
A device according to claim 1 characterised in
that the discrete bodies (26) of contaminant-sorbing

material are in the form of filaments (26) of that material
which depend from adjacent the bag support (30) into the

bag (3).
A device (2) according to claim 2 characterised
in that the filaments (26) are longer from their upper ends

to their opposite ends than the length of the bag (3) from
the location of the filament upper ends to the bottom of

the bag (3).
A device (2) according to either one of claims
2 and 3 characterised in that the filaments (26) are

defined by a folded sheet of said material having slits
between end margins of the sheet, or by a plurality of slit

and folded sheets (35a-35e) of said material arranged in
staggered layers within the bag (3).

preceding claims characterised in that at least one

continuous layer (22, 24) of said material lines an
