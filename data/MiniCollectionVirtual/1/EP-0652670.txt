<ABSTRACT>
An image encoding apparatus comprises a counter 
for counting a run length of an input pixel signal, an 

encoder for outputting a code corresponding to the 
count of the counter, and a decompressor for 

decompressing the compressed code outputted from the 
encoder. The encoder outputs a compressed code having 

a data width of N bits (N = M + L) with M high order 
bits representing a code length of an original code 

and L low order bits representing a compressed code 
representing L low order bits of the original code. 

When the code length of the original code is less than L 
bits, the encoder outputs the compressed code with the 

original code being placed in the high order bits 
starting from the high order end and 0 bits being filled 

in the remaining low order bits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image encoding 
apparatus and method by the modified Huffman (MH), the 
modified READ (MR) and the modified READ (MMR) 
encoding systems, and more particularly to image 
encoding apparatus and method which perform real time 
processing. Fig. 5 shows a block diagram of a prior art image 
encoding apparatus by the MH, MR and MMR systems. For one-dimension encoding, a pixel signal passed 
through an input circuit 101 is supplied to a run length 
counter 102. The number of continuous white or black 
pixels (run length) is counted by the run length counter 
102. A ROM address generation circuit 503 generates an 
address for accessing a reference table ROM 504 based 
on the count (run length) of the run length counter 102. 
MH codes for the run lengths are written in the reference 
table ROM 504 and an output therefrom is outputted as an 
encoded code through an output circuit 107. On the other hand, for two-dimension encoding, 
the pixel signal passed through the input circuit 101 is 
supplied to a line FIFO 108 and a relative pixel 
position extract circuit 109. The line FIFO is provided  
 
to refer data of previous line to the currently 
scanned line in the two-dimension encoding, and the 
relative pixel position extract circuit 109 refers the 
data stored in the line FIFO 108 to extract a relative 
position of a pixel color change point of the currently 
scanned line and that of the previous line. In 
accordance with the result of the relative pixel position 
extract circuit 109, a two-dimension code generation 
circuit 511 generates a code so that the encoded code 
is outputted through the output circuit 107. The above MH code is a variable length code. 
For example, a shortest length code is a 2-bit code 
such as "11" corresponding to a black pixel having a run 
length of 2 while a longest length code is 13-bit code 
such as "0000001101100" corresponding to a black pixel 
having a run length of 512. In addition to those codes, when the MH code is 
applied to the MR code or the MMR code, a color 
identification code and an encoding mode identification 
bit are required. Further, in a packing process in the 
output unit, it may be necessary to conduct a code 
shift process by using the code length of the MH code 
resulting from the encoding. Considering these 
situations, 19 or 20 bits are required for the data 
length of the data outputted by encoding the run length. Thus, the ROM for processing such variable 
length code is of large scale.  On the other hand, in the
