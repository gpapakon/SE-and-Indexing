<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical 
aerosol formulations and in particular to pharmaceutical 
suspension aerosol formulations wherein the propellant 
comprises HFC 134a or HFC 227. Pharmaceutical suspension aerosol 
formulations currently use a mixture of liquid 
chlorofluorocarbons as the propellant. 
Fluorotrichloromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane and 
dichlorotetrafluoroethane are the most commonly used 
propellants in aerosol formulations for administration 
by inhalation. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), however, have 
been implicated in the destruction of the ozone layer 
and their production is being phased out. 
Hydrofluorocarbon 134a (HFC 134a, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) 
and hydrofluorocarbon 227 (HFC 227, 
1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) are viewed as being 
more ozone friendly than many chlorofluorocarbon 
propellants; furthermore, they have low toxicity and 
vapor pressures suitable for use in aerosols. Patent Applications WO 91/11495 and WO 
91/11496 (both by Weil) describe pharmaceutical 
suspension aerosol formulations comprising a medicinal 
agent, optionally a surfactant, and a propellant 
mixture containing 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane and 
one or more additional components, e.g., pentane,  
 
butane, propellant 134a, propellant 11, propellant 125, 
or propellant 152a. European Patent Office Publication 0 384 371 
(Heiskel) describes solution aerosols in which 
1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane or its mixture with 
propane, butane, isobutane, dimethyl ether, or 1,1-difluoroethane 
serves as the propellant. The 
application does not, however, disclose suspension 
aerosols or pharmaceutical aerosol formulations. European Patent Application 89.312270.5 
(Purewal et al.) discloses, inter alia, aerosol 
formulations comprising a medicament, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 
a surface active agent, and at least 
one compound having higher polarity than 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. U.S. Pat. No. 2,868,691 (Porush et al.) 
discloses aerosol formulations comprising a medicament, 
a halogenated lower alkane propellant, and a cosolvent 
which assists in dissolving the medicament in the 
propellant. The chemical formula for the propellant 
given in Col. 2, lines 6-16, generically embraces HFC 
134a and HFC 227. Examples of cosolvents disclosed 
include ethanol and diethyl ether. U.S. Pat. No. 3,014,844 (Thiel et al.) 
discloses aerosol formulations comprising a micronized 
medicament, a halogenated lower alkane propellant and a 
surface-active agent to assist in the suspension of the 
medicament in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pharmaceutical suspension formulation 
suitable for aerosol administration, consisting of a 

therapeutically effective amount of a drug and a 
propellant selected from HFC 134a, HFC 227 and a mixture 

thereof, the formulation exhibiting substantially no 
growth in particle size or change in crystal morphology 

of the drug over a prolonged period, being substantially 
and readily redispersible, and upon redispersion does not 

flocculate so quickly as to prevent reproducible dosing 
of the drug. 
A formulation as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
the propellant is a mixture of HFC 134a and HFC 227. 
A formulation as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
the propellant is HFC 227. 
A formulation as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
the propellant is HFC 134a. 
A formulation as claimed in any preceding Claim 
in which the drug concentration is less than 0.1 percent. 
A formulation as claimed in any one of Claims 1 
to 4 in which the drug concentration is greater than 0.1 

percent and less than 0.5 percent. 
A formulation as claimed in any one of Claims 1 
to 4 in which the drug concentration is greater than 0.5 

percent. 
A formulation as claimed in any one of Claims 1 
to 4 in which the drug has a potency such that a 

concentration of less than 0.1 percent is therapeutically 
effective. 
A formulation as claimed in any preceding Claim 
in which the drug is selected from formoterol, 

salmeterol, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts 
thereof. 
A formulation as claimed in Claim 9 in which 
the drug is formoterol fumarate.  

 
A formulation as claimed in Claim 10 in which 
the propellant contains substantially equal amounts of 

HFC 134a and HFC 227. 
A formulation as claimed in any one of Claims 1 
to 4 in which the drug is selected from albuterol, 

beclomethasone dipropionate, cromolyn, pirbuterol, and a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. 
A formulation as claimed in Claim 12 in which 
the drug is selected from albuterol sulfate, disodium 

cromoglycate, and pirbuterol acetate. 
A metered dose aerosol canister containing a 
formulation as claimed in any preceding Claim in an 

amount sufficient to provide a plurality of 
therapeutically effective doses of the drug. 
A method of preparing a formulation as defined 
in Claim 1 comprising the steps of: (i) combining an 

amount of the drug sufficient to provide a plurality of 
therapeutically effective doses and a propellant selected 

from HFC 134a, HFC 227, and a mixture thereof in an 
amount sufficient to propel from an aerosol canister a 

plurality of therapeutically effective doses of the drug; 
and (ii) dispersing the drug in the propellant.
