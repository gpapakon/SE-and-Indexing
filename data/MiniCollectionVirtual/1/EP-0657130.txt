<ABSTRACT>
A fastening device (4) molded of a synthetic resin 
material and adapted to be engaged with a large number of 

loops (11a) on one surface of a fastener part (11) of a mating 
member (1) includes a base member (42) having on its one surface 

a large number of hooks (43) integrally molded with the 
base member and arranged in a plurality of rows (R). The 

hooks in each hook row generally have the same hook direction 
aligned with an axis of the hook row, and the hooks in one 

hook row and the hooks in an adjacent hook row do not always 
have the same hook direction. At least one hook (43a) in 

each hook row (R) which is adjacent to a peripheral edge of 
the base member have a hook direction facing outwardly away 

from the peripheral edge. With this arrangement, the hooks 
located adjacent to the peripheral edge are capable of withstanding 

undue force tending to fatigue and eventually break 
the hooks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastening device
or fastener, such as a screen hanging fastener for connecting
a curtain rail and various hanging screens such as a
curtain, or an interior finish material fastener interposed
between a mounting member such as a ceiling, a floor surface
or a panel of the room interior, and a plate member such as
a mat, a carpet, a wall covering material, a ceiling covering
material or a dashboard for securely attaching the
mounting member and the plate member.Most curtains used in hospitals and hotels are held
under a lease and they are replaced and laundered periodically.
To improve the efficiency of the curtain replacement
work, an appropriate measure should be taken to facilitate
the attachment and detachment of curtains. To cope with
this requirement, Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication
No. HEI 4-104909, for example, discloses a prior proposal
made to enable easy attachment and detachment of a curtain
relative to curtain runners mounted on a curtain guide
member, such as a curtain rail or a guide bar. A screen
hanging fastener according to the prior proposal is composed 
of a plate-like fastening device made from a synthetic resin
and including a number of hooks arranged in a plurality of
rows and integrally molded on the face of a base member, and
a metal hook portion formed from two metal wires and integrally
molded in an upper portion of the base member for
releasable engagement with a curtain runner. The hooks are
molded such that they are aligned in the vertical, horizontal
and diagonal direction and form a plurality of rows of hooks
arranged in the widthwise direction of the fastening device.
The hooks in each hook row are aligned with an axis of the
hook row and have the same direction of bend or hook (hereinafter
referred to as "hook direction"). The hooks in each
pair of adjacent rows have either the same hook direction,
or alternatively opposite hook directions. In the fastening
devices of this type, in order to support a curtain in a
vertically suspended condition, the hooks in the most part
of the hook rows generally have a hook direction facing
upwards, as shown in FIG. 10(A), to secure a desired fastening
strength.On the other hand, to various mounting members,
such as a ceiling, a floor surface and a door panel of an
automobile, and a wall, a ceiling and a floor surface of a
building various interior finish materials are attached
mostly by use of a surface-type fastener generally known as
"hook-and-loop" fastener. Male and female fastener

<CLAIMS>
A fastening device (4; 45) molded of synthetic
resin and adapted to be engaged with a fastener part (11;

110) of a mating member (1; 70), said fastening device (4;
45) including a base member (42; 46) having on its one

surface a number of hooks ( 43; 47) integrally molded with
said base member (42; 46) and arranged in a plurality of

rows (R), the hooks (43; 47) in each hook row (R) generally
having the same hook direction aligned with an axis of the

hook row (R), the hooks (43; 47) in one hook row (R) and the
hooks (43; 47) in an adjacent hook row (R) not always having

the same hook direction, characterized in that at least one

hook (43a; 47a) in each hook row (R) which is adjacent to a
peripheral edge of said base member (42; 46) has a hook

direction facing outwardly away from the said peripheral
edge.
A fastening device (4) according to claim 1,
wherein said mating member (1) is a hanging screen, such as

a curtain, and wherein said fastening device (4) further
includes a round hook portion (41) having a neck (41b)

formed integrally with an upper end of said base member
(42), and those hooks (43a) which are disposed along a lower

end edge of said base member (42) have a hook direction
facing downwards.

wherein said round hook portion (41) has an opening (41a)

defined between said neck (41b) and a tip end of said round
hook portion (41), and said round hook portion (41) further

includes a beak-like straight portion (41c) contiguous to
said tip end and extending radially outwardly therefrom

substantially at right angles to said round hook portion
(41).
A fastening device (45) according to claim 1,
wherein said mating member (70) is a plate-like interior

finish material, and wherein said base member (46) has a
certain degree of rigidity, said hooks (47) on said one surface

of said base member (46) are arranged in a number of
rows (R), in each of these hook rows (R) extending perpendicular

to a peripheral edge of said base member (46), at
least an outermost hook (47a) located adjacent to said peripheral

edge has a hook direction facing outwards of said
peripheral edge, said fastening device (45) further includes

a stud-like projection (48a) disposed centrally on the other
surface of said base member (46) and on which a wing-like

resilient locking portion (48) is formed at a front end
thereof for locking engagement with a mounting member (60)

to which said interior finish material (70) is to be attached,
and said resilient locking portion (48) is adapted to be

forced through an opening (60a) in said mounting member (60)
to attach said fastening device (45) to said mounting member
