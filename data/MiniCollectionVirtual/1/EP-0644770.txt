<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a complex comprising a growth hormone (also
referred to as a somatotropin) and an aromatic aldehyde. More specifically, this
invention relates to a porcine somatotropin (PST)-aromatic aldehyde complex and to
a method of producing stable PST compositions resulting in improved feed
efficiency in the swine and a prolonged release of the PST.When porcine somatotropin (PST) is administered to pigs on a daily basis a
marked improvement in feed efficiency, i.e., feed-to-gain, the animal takes in less
food than control animals while gaining weight at the same or greater level.
However, it is inconvenient to administer drugs to the swine on a daily basis
because of the large expense and amount of time required to deliver the drug to each
member of a large group of animals. It would, therefore, be more feasible to apply
a single dose and have the PST release over a prolonged period of time. It would
appear the easiest way to administer PST would be in a feed, however, like most
proteins and macromolecular drugs, PST is not orally bioavailable. In general, the
literature has not shown significant ability to deliver proteins and peptides via the
oral route. The use of salicylates and mineral oil to enhance oral delivery of these
drugs is disclosed in E.P. Application No. 0177342. U.S. Patent 4,548,922, further
discloses the use of steroid enhancers, such as fusidic acid.Parenteral administration, for example, implants have been employed with
other macromolecular drugs to give a prolonged release as disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,666,704. PST is an unstable protein susceptible to enzymatic, as well as
aqueous degradation. It reacts with itself and is readily cleaved by proteases.
Indeed, the instability of the PST implant is thought to be due to the proteases that
are generated at the implantation site because of the inflammatory response that
takes place (U.S. Patent 5,015,627). It is because of this instability that the
administration of PST to swine has hitherto been only marginally, if at all
successful. (See for example: U.S. Patents 4,837,381, 4,857,505; 5,045,312, and
EP Applications 0193917 and 0458064).There is a commercial need for improved prolonged release implants for
parenteral administration of macromolecular drugs having growth hormone activity. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a composition and
method for stabilizing and releasing a biological active growth hormone in animals
over a prolonged period of time.It is a further object of this invention to
