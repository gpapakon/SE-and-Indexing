<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to an improved lubricant prepared from a mixture of boric acid and oil or grease or other such base medium lubricant. More particularly, the invention relates to a mixture containing boric acid particles in a mixture and/or suspension with a particular range of particle sizes and amounts. Lubricants serve an important function in preserving machine components and extending machine operating lifetimes. Optimization of lubricant-properties has remained a primary objective as machines are operated under more demanding and difficult conditions associated with increased efficiency and performance. Numerous additives have been developed, but much remains to be done to accommodate the increased demands now being made of lubricants.It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved lubricant.It is another object of the invention to provide a novel lubricant additive.It is a further object of the invention to provide an improved solid phase lubricant additive.It is an additional object of the invention to provide a novel lubricant of boric acid solids dispersed in a base lubricant.It is yet another object of the invention to provide an improved method of lubricating ceramic and/or metal components using a boric acid dispersed in a base lubricant.It is still a further object of the invention to provide a novel multifunctional lubricant having boric acid and polymer solids additives to a base lubricant.It is also an additional object of the invention to provide an improved solid lubricant and method of use for a boric acid/polymer mixture.According to the invention a lubricating composition comprises a stable dispersion of at least 0.1% by weight of a solid state substantially layered crystalline boric acid additive having a particle size from 0.2 to 40 micro metres, and a base lubricant.The lubricating composition preferably comprises from 10 to 50% by weight solid state boric acid additive.Other advantages and details of the invention will become apparent from the description provided hereinafter along with the appended claims.In one preferred embodiment of the invention, an additive to a base lubricant takes the form of a dispersion of boric acid or boric acid-forming boron oxide. Boric acid powders are available from US Borax Co. of Los Angeles, CA. The resulting lubricant with boric acid dispersion therein takes advantage of the low friction properties of boric acid when suspended in lubricants. Examples of base lubricants are oils such as petroleum based oils,
