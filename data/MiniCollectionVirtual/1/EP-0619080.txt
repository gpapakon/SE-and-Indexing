<ABSTRACT>
An improved pasta product is made by incorporating 
an 
aedu
 starch, a 
duh
 starch or a mixture thereof in an 
amount of about 5% to about 50% by weight of farinaceous 

material. The pasta has improved texture and works well 
in retort, frozen foods, microwave foods and food service 

applications. The use of 
aedu
 starch and 
duh
 starch to 
improve the texture is also applicable to tortillas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to food and, more
particularly, to an improved formulation and process for
making pasta products such as spaghetti, macaroni and
noodles.Pasta products are conventionally made by forming a
paste or dough from flour and water, shaping the dough
into a ribbon, cylinder, conduit or some other shape and
then cooking the shaped dough. This shaping can be done
by using conventional equipment such as extrusion with an
extruder equipped with the appropriate die. If an egg is
added to the dough and the dough formed into a ribbon,
the finished product is typically referred to as a noodle
or egg noodle. Optionally, other ingredients are also
added to the dough such as flavoring or coloring. The
fresh raw pasta is cooked, generally in boiling water,
and then the cooked pasta product is drained before human
consumption. Alternatively, the shaped dough is dried
and sold to the consumer. Typically, the cooked product
is consumed with a tomato-based sauce, a cream-based
sauce or an oil-based sauce. Pasta products differ from
other farinaceous products primarily by the fact that no
leavening agent is added to the dough.Pasta products are used in prepared and processed
foods such as canned foods, frozen foods and chilled
foods and by food service operations where the pasta
product is subjected to extended periods of time on a
steam table or other warming device. All of these
processes require that the pasta be able to withstand
less than ideal conditions for extended periods of time.The texture of pasta products made from conventional
ingredients, such as durum wheat flour and water, tends
to deteriorate after long storage or extended processing.
In the food service operation, pasta tends to become
tacky and gummy and lose its structure after extended 
periods on the steam table. A solution has been to cook
only small quantities of pasta and throw it out when its
texture deteriorates. In the frozen foods area, the
pasta is generally cooked, combined with meat and sauce,
and then frozen so that it need only be heated in a
microwave oven, a conventional oven, or by boiling in a
bag. Due to the faster heating rate of the pasta
compared to the meat or sauce, the pasta tends to become
soft and gummy and lose its structure upon reheating.
One solution to this has been to prepare the pasta in a
separate bag from the sauce so that the two may be heated
at different rates. A solution in the retort field
suggested by U.S. Patent No. 4,590,084 is the use of a
high amylose corn starch, i.e. starch extracted

<CLAIMS>
A pasta or tortilla product which is prepared from a dough comprising:

a flour component, water, and a novel starch selected from the group consisting of
amylose extender dull (aedu) starch, dull horny (duh) starch and a mixture thereof,

wherein said novel starch is present in said dough in an amount of 5% to
50% by weight of farinaceous material.
The product of claim 1 wherein the effective starch is either in the native form,
chemically modified or physically modified.
The product of claim 1 wherein the effective amount of the novel starch is about 10%
to about 40% by weight of farinaceous material.
The product of claim 1 wherein the effective amount of the novel starch is about 15%
to about 25% by weight of farinaceous material.
The product of claim 1 wherein the dough comprises up to about 30% water; about 5
to 50% of said novel starch; and 95 to 50% flour component.
The product of claim 1 wherein said dough further comprises an egg in an amount of
up to about 70% by weight farinaceous material.
The product of claim 1 wherein the pasta product is selected from the group
consisting of spaghetti, macaroni and noodles.
The product of claim 1 wherein the flour component is a wheat flour. 
The product of claim 1 wherein the novel starch is added in granular form or in a
ground form.
A process for making a product selected from the group consisting of a pasta or
tortilla product, said process comprising the steps of:


(a) forming a dough comprising a flour component, water and a novel starch selected
from the group consisting of amylose extender dull (aedu) starch, dull horny (duh)

starch and a mixture thereof, wherein said novel starch is present in said dough in an
amount of 5% to 50% by weight of farinaceous material; and
(b) cooking said dough to produce the product.
The process of claim 10 wherein the effective amount of novel starch is about 10%
to about 40% by weight of farinaceous material.
The process of claim 10 wherein the effective amount of the novel starch is about
15% to about 25% by weight of farinaceous material.
The process of claim 10 wherein cooking is accomplished in an oven.
The process of claim 11 wherein cooking is done in boiling water.
The process of claim 10 wherein the novel starch is obtained from maize.
