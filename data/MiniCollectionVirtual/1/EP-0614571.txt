 MULTI-POLE COMPOSITE MAGNET USED IN A MAGNETIC ENCODERI* Field of the Invention«r 5 The present invention relates to a magnet having multiple north-south poles, and in particular to a composite magnet constructed of two interlocking pieces, each piece having complementary apertures and protrusions to form the multiple north-south poles. The present 10 invention further relates to an encoder using the above- described magnet.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONConstructing a magnet with multiple north-south poles is well-known in the art. For example, U.S. Patent No.15 3,127,544 issued to Blume, Jr., discloses an apparatus for magnetizing permanent magnet materials to form band-like poles. Blume discloses an apparatus comprised of an upper and a lower assembly. Each assembly has a north primary pole piece, a south primary pole piece and an electro-20 magnetic coil which establishes a magnetic potential difference between the primary pole pieces. These two assemblies, as their electro-magnets are activated, form alternate north-south magnetic poles on magnetic material passed between the assemblies. However, using this25 configuration, the north-south poles are not well-defined. This lack of definition is caused by a phenomena referred to as a "Bloch wall". When a "Bloch wall" occurs, the transition from one polarity to another is accompanied by a decrease in the magnetic field and a gradual switching30 from north to south and from south to north poles. This transition requires a finite distance through the material in which to occur so as to complete the switch. Therefore, the distance associated with the polarity switch fails to have well-defined poles. 

 Another prior art multi-pole magnet, U.S. Patent No. 4,513,216 issued to Mueller, teaches a multi-pole rotor having its multiple north-south fields on its circumference. Mueller discloses a rotor having a minimum of three pieces, two of which are crown gears and one of which is a ferrous ring which completes a magnetic circuit on the internal side. Depending upon the cylindrical height of the particular rotor, Mueller uses spacer material, referred to as pole carriers, for structural strength. Hence, Mueller's assembly consists of many parts which present considerable problems in manufactur¬ ing, particularly significantly increasing material and labor costs.Therefore, a need arises for a magnet which is easily magnetized, having a minimum number of pieces and exhibiting multi-poles which are well-defined.Many types of encoders, including optical, mechanical,
