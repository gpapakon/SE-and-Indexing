<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to enzymatically cleavable prodrugs with 
reduced Michaelis-Menten constant (Km). A prodrug may be defined as a chemical which is non-toxic and 
pharmacodynamically inert, but which can be transformed in vivo 
to a pharmacologically active drug. The invention refers to the field of drug-targeting, which 
deals with site-specific delivery of drugs in vivo. Site-specific 
delivery preferably increases the selectivity of drugs 
and reduces their undesirable side effects. One potential approach to achieve a site-specific delivery 
consists in applying untoxic prodrugs which can be site-specifically 
activated to cytotoxic drugs using prelocalized 
prodrug cleaving catalysts like enzymes, muteins derived from 
enzymes, catalytic antibodies, antibody enzyme conjugates or 
fusion proteins. This approach combines the advantage of drug delivery via 
prodrugs (i.e. increased stability, adjusted solubility, 
improved route of administration, more favourable distribution, 
improved pharmacokinetics, by-passing resistance; T.A. Connors, 
Xenobiotica 16, 975-988, 1986) with the preferential tumour 
specific activation mediated by a catalytic principle. The use 
of exogenous enzymes or polyclonal antibody enzyme conjugates 
for prodrug activation was pioneered by Graffi (Deutsche 
Offenlegungsschrift 22 12 014), and Philpott et al. (J. 
Immunol. 111, 921, 1973). More recently the original teaching from Graffi and Philpott 
was exemplified and improved by the use of monoclonal antibody  
 
enzyme conjugates as prodrug activating catalysts (Bagshawe et 
al., Brit. J. Cancer, 58, 700, 1988; Senter et al., 
Bioconjugate Chem. 4, 3-9, 1993) or fusion proteins (Bosslet et 
al., Brit. J. Cancer, 65, 234-238, 1992; Goshorn et al., Cancer 
Res. 53, 2123-2127, 1993). Despite these improvements, the systems described so far have 
some major disadvantages for clinical applications: 
a) monoclonal antibody enzyme conjugates produced by chemical 
coupling have as a major drawback a strong immunogenicity 
in man due to the xenogenic origin of the antibody moiety 
and the enzyme (Bagshawe et al., Disease Markers 9: 233-238, 
1991). As a consequence of this high immunogenicity 
repetitive applications in man are possible only to a very 
limited extent; b) fusion proteins consisting of non-humanised binding 
moieties and xenogenic enzymes produced by recombinant DNA 
technology will be immunogenic in man as well with 
disadvantages comparable to monoclonal antibody enzyme 
conjugates, if repetitive applications
