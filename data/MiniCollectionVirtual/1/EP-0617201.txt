<ABSTRACT>
The pump has, in a bearing and sealing housing (21), an inlet space (28) and a driveshaft (23) which drives the rotor (55) and the two eccentric guide discs (40.2) connected to it. Slide rings (45.1, 45.2) are mounted in annular grooves in said eccentric guide discs. Said slide rings bear the arresting slides (46.1, 46.2) which penetrate, via abutment sealing surfaces, into slide receiving spaces or are drawn out therefrom. The pump is suitable for applications requiring a high degree of hygiene, for example foodstuffs, medicaments and cosmetics, and can also deliver sensitive constituents, such as fruits or other foodstuff constituents, in a gentle manner.
