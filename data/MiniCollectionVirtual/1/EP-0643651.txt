<ABSTRACT>
Described is a vehicle brake system in which a brake pressure which is dependent on the output signal from the braking value sensor (1) is applied to the brakes (9) and in which the applied brake pressure (7) is also made dependent on the vehicle load so that the pressure, in dependence on the load, is limited to a partial pressure (Ptb). If the braking value sensor (1) is fully or almost fully actuated, the system switches over to a special control mode in which a brake-pressure increase (7b) over and above the limit (Ptb) takes place.

Vehicle brake system having an electronic control 
unit (2) 


which applies a brake pressure (P
STB
) which is dependent 
on the output signal of a brake value sensor (1) to the 

brakes under open-loop or closed-loop control by 
electrical activation of electrically actuable brake-pressure 

adjustment elements (3) assigned to the brakes, 
which makes the brake pressure (P
STB
) to be applied 
additionally dependent on the load (5) of the vehicle 

such that the brake pressure is limited to a partial 
brake pressure value (P
TB
) as a function of the load, 
which, when the brake value sensor (1) is actuated 
beyond a prescribed degree, which corresponds at least 

approximately to maximum actuation, switches over the 
system to a special control mode in which a further brake 

pressure increase beyond the limit takes place, 
characterized in that 
the control unit (2) includes means (23) which check 
whether the brake pressure sensor (1) is actuated beyond 

the prescribed degree, and if this is the case switch 
over the system to the special control mode, 
the control unit (2) furthermore includes means (27) 
which produce a rising signal in the spe
cial control 
mode, by means of which signal the brake pressure is 

increased with a prescribed gradient beyond the limit. 
Vehicle brake system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the further increase in brake 

pressure takes place after a waiting time while the 
partial brake pressure value is maintained.  

 
Vehicle brake system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that if an anti-lock brake system is 

present, the said system assumes the further control of 
the brake pressure starting from the point at which the 

locking pressure is reached. 
Vehicle brake system according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that switching over to the 

special control mode only takes place when the vehicle is 
travelling.
