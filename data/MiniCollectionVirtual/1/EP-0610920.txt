<ABSTRACT>
A naphthol-modified phenolic resin having low 
softening point and good flowability is obtained by 

allowing a naphthol and a phenol to react with an aldehyde 
in the presence of an acid catalyst at 60 to 110°C to 

obtain a primary reaction mixture, heating the primary 
reaction mixture in the presence of a strong acid, a super 

acid or a mixture thereof under ambient pressure at 120 to 
180°C for 1 to 12 hours to obtain a secondary reaction 

mixture, and subjecting the secondary reaction mixture to 
vacuum concentration or steam distillation. 

Instead of the primary reaction mixture, a mixture of a phenolic resin, 
a naphthol and a phenol can be reacted under the same conditions. 

The naphthol-modified phenolic resin is suited to use as a 
curing agent in epoxy resin molding materials for sealing 

electronic parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
preparing a naphthol-modified phenolic resin which is a
suitable curing agent for epoxy resins, and to an epoxy
resin molding material for sealing electronic parts which
contains the naphthol-modified phenolic resin prepared by
the method.The epoxy resin molding material for sealing
electronic parts of the present invention is suited to
production of VLSIs (very large scale integrated circuits)
which require both a high glass transition temperature and
an excellent resistance to reflow cracking.Epoxy resin molding materials have been used
widely to seal electronic parts, such as transistors and
ICs. The reason is that epoxy resins are well balanced in
properties including electrical properties, moisture
resistance, heat resistance, mechanical properties and 
adhesive properties to inserted parts. In particular,
epoxy resin molding materials composed of o-cresol novolac
epoxy resins and phenol novolac curing agents are
particularly well balanced in these properties and are now
mainly used as the base resins of molding materials for
sealing ICs.ICs have been thinned and downsized for high
density mounting on printed wiring boards. Thinned and
downsized packages however are apt to crack during mounting
by soldering (fusing step). This is the problem pertaining
to ICs for surface mounting that is to be solved at
present. One means proposed for solving this problem is
molding such thin packages, such as TSOPs (thin small
outline packages), by using a sealing material containing a
biphenyl skeleton epoxy resin [Japanese Patent Application
Kokai Koho (Laid-open) No. 58-39677]. Biphenyl skeleton
epoxy resins have low hygroscopicity and high moisture
resistance, and sealing materials containing the epoxy
resins exhibit excellent resistance to reflow cracking.However, when cured with phenol novolac resins,
the biphenyl skeleton epoxy resins suffer a decrease in
glass transition temperature. To solve this problem, it
has been tried to modify phenol novolac resins by
introduction of various substituents or naphthol skeletons
[Japanese Patent Application Kokai Koho (Laid-open) No. 4-199856]. 
199856].However, introduction of very bulky substituents
or rigid skeleton structures, such as naphthol skeletons,
into curing agents adversely affects the softening point
and flowability of molding materials for sealing ICs, and
has not yet been put into practical application.DE-A-41 19 552 relates to epoxy resin compositions comprising
an expoxy resin with at least two epoxy groups
