<ABSTRACT>
An electrically programmable memory cell array comprises a cell field with memory cells in a main face of a semiconductor substrate (1), each cell having at least one vertical MOS transistor with a gate dielectric of a material with traps. Preferably, (a) the substrate (1) has a first conductivity type doping at least in the cell field region; (b) stripe-shaped second opposite conductivity type doped regions (10a, 10b) are located at the bottom of insulation trenches and on the main substrate face between adjacent trenches and extend parallel to the trenches; (c) the memory cells are located respectively at opposite side walls of the trenches; (d) word lines (18a) extend across the trenches and are connected to the gate electrodes of the vertical MOS transistors located below the respective word lines; and (e) each memory cell has a hole which extends from one trench side wall into the trench, the hole surface being provided with the gate dielectric (17) and being filled with a gate electrode (18) so that the stripe-shaped doped regions (10a, 10b) form the source/drain regions of the vertical MOS transistors. Also claimed is a process for producing the memory cell array.
