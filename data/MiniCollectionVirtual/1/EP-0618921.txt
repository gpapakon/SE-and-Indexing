A process for the production of alkyl oligoglucosides 
of reduced polyglucose content, 
characterized in 
that
a) water-containing glucose sirup is added to a mixture 
of a lower alcohol and an acidic catalyst at a 

temperature of 100 to 115°C, 
b) water present in the reaction mixture and water 
which has been released are azeotropically distilled 

off, 
c) after the glucose sirup has been added, the reaction 
mixture is subjected to an after-reaction at a 

temperature of 100 to 115°C, 
d) the lower alkyl oligoglucoside/lower alcohol mixture 
formed as intermediate product is added to a fatty 

alcohol at a temperature of 110 to 125°C, 
e) lower alcohol present in the reaction mixture and 
lower alcohol which has been released are distilled 

off, 
f) after the lower alkyl oligoglucoside/lower alcohol 
mixture has been added, the reaction mixture is 

subjected to another after-reaction at a temperature 
of 105 to 115°C and 
g) the reaction mixture is subsequently neutralized by 
methods known per se and freed from excess fatty 

alcohol. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 glucose sirup having a solids content of 50 to 85% 
by weight, based on the sirup, is used. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, 
characterized 
in that
 glucose sirup having a DP degree 1 of 90 
to 100% by weight, based on the sirup, is used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
3, 
characterized in that
 lower alcohols corresponding to 
formula (I): 


R
1
-OH
 
in which R
1
 is a linear or branched alkyl radical containing 
1 to 8 carbon atoms,
 
are used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
4, 
characterized in that
 acidic catalysts selected from 
the group consisting of p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic 

acid, butanesulfonic acid and sulfosuccinic acid 
are used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
5, 
characterized in that
 glucose and lower alcohol are 
used in a molar ratio of 1:5 to 1:
10. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
6, 
characterized in that
 the acidic catalyst is used in 
quantities of 3·10
-3
 to 2·10
-2
 moles per mole of glucose. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
7, 
characterized in that
 the mixture of glucose sirup, 
lower alcohol and catalyst is circulated through a 

falling-film evaporator as heat exchanger. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
8, 
characterized in that
 fatty alcohols corresponding to 
formula (II): 


R
2
-OH
  
 

in which R
2
 is a linear or branched alkyl radical containing 
10 to 22 carbon atoms,
 
are used. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
9, 
characterized in that
 glucose and fatty alcohol are 
used in a molar ratio of 1:4 to 1:6. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
10, 
characterized in that
 the reaction of the lower alkyl 
oligoglucoside/lower alcohol mixture with the fatty 

alcohol is carried out under reduced pressure. 
A process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 
11, 
characterized in that
 the process is carried out 
continuously in a cascade of stirred reactors.
