<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for
reception/transmission of electromagnetic waves.Telecommunication services of the wireless
interactive type are developing rapidly. These services
relate to telephony, facsimile transmission, television,
in particular digital television, the so-called
"multimedia" field and the internet network. The
equipment for these mass-market services have to be
made available at a reasonable cost. This is so, in
particular, as regards the user's receiver/transmitter
which has to communicate with a server, most often via
a telecommunication satellite, or in the scope of an
MMDS (Multi-point Multi-channel Distribution System),
LMDS (Local Multi-point Distribution System) or MVDS
(Multi-point Video Distribution System) system, these
being explained in the book "Reference Data for
Engineers" SAMS Publishing - Chapter 35, page 20. These
communication methods generally use the microwave
range. For example, in the scope of the MMDS system,
frequency bands of the order of 40 GHz are used.For these frequency ranges, a waveguide
receiver and a waveguide transmitter are customarily
used, the two waveguides being separate.This technology is complicated to use if it is
necessary to make a return link from the customer to
the base station with a view to conveying a flow of
information or instructions from the customer to the
source of the service (for example, in the field of
audio-visual programmes, pay per view). It is therefore
expensive. Furthermore, its weight and its bulk are
incompatible with use by private individuals. What is
more, it is advantageous to provide isolation between
the transmission link and the reception link, and thus
to avoid degradation of the reception signal by the
transmission signal.The invention overcomes the aforementioned
drawbacks. It is characterized in that the device includes
a waveguide coupled to a microstrip reception circuit
and to a microstrip transmission circuit, said circuits
being arranged respectively in a first straight section
and a second straight section of said guide, parallel
to the first, said guide furthermore including
filtering means arranged so that the waves broadcast by
said transmission circuit are attenuated enough, at the
reception circuit, not to cause interference in said
reception circuit.Such a device employing hybrid microstrip and
waveguide technology can be produced at moderate cost.
Its bulk and its weight are reduced, and transmission
and reception are nonetheless possible simultaneously.
What is more, the use of a
