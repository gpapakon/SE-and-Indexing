Receiving device for receiving information which 
has been transmitted in a wire-free manner, in particular 

with the aid of infrared signals, and has been transmitted 
from a battery-operated transmitter in the form of 

at least one information word comprising a plurality of 
bits, having an evaluation unit for evaluation of the 

received pulses, it being possible for the evaluation 
unit to use the received pulses to identify that the 

battery capacity in the transmitting unit has run down, 
having a display unit which is activated to emit a 

warning signal when the evaluation unit identifies that 
the battery capacity in the transmitting unit has run 

down, characterized in that the evaluation unit (29) is 
designed such that it determines at least the number of 

completely received information words (31) during a 
reception process, and in that it actuates the display 

unit (30) to emit the warning signal when the number of 
completely received information words is less than a 

predetermined reference value. 
Receiving device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, in the event of reception of a plurality of 

information words (31), said receiving device waits for 
a synchronization time between the individual information 

words (31). 
Receiving device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said receiving device successively 

increases a time counter between the received pulses. 
Receiving device according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that said receiving device compares the count on  

 
the time counter with predetermined limit values, in that 

the comparison result defines the respective bit state 
(LOW/HIGH) or the incompleteness of the received 

information. 
Receiving device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the evaluation unit 

(29) is electrically coupled to a visual display unit 
(28), and in that the warning signal is displayed on the 

screen. 
Receiving device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the evaluation unit 

(29) additionally measures and evaluates the strength of 
the respectively received pulse as a function of the 

number of received pulses in order to identify any 
necessity for battery replacement in the transmitting 

unit (10). 
Receiving device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that, after receiving a 

pulse, the evaluation unit (29) activates the display 
unit (30) to emit a signal which indicates the arrival of 

information. 
Receiving device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the reference value 

represents a learnt value which results from the storage 
of the values for the number of received information 

words.
