<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an injection syringe 1 with a barrel 2 on one end of which there can be attached a needle holder 4 holding an injection needle 11, a piston 6 which can be displaced in the barrel 2 and on which there is attached a piston rod 5 projecting from the other end of the barrel 2 and provided with an operating handle 23 on its end, as well as a device for automatically locking the piston 6 that has been advanced beyond a predetermined extent in the direction of the injection needle 11 on the needle holder 4 to prevent retraction of the piston 6, in which the needle holder 4 can be connected to the barrel 2 via a rotating connection 8, 15 that can be released by twisting-in and, if appropriate, axial displacement of the needle holder 4 into the barrel 2, and in which rotating securing members 18, 21, which engage in each other on advance of the piston 6 in the direction of the needle holder 4 for the purpose of locking the piston 6 on the needle holder 4 and which permit release of the rotating connection 8, 15 and thereupon drawing of the piston 6, needle holder 4 and injection needle 11 over their entire length into the barrel 2 by twisting the operating member 23, are located on the needle holder 4 and the piston 6, the rotating securing members 18, 21 being webs 18, 21 that have angular distances from one another and can be brought into mutual, meshing engagement by axial advance of the piston 6, characterised in that there are engagement means 31, 32 between the inner circumference of the barrel 2 and the outer circumference of the needle holder 4, which engagement means permit comparatively easy twisting-in of the rotating connection 8, 15 between the needle holder 4 and the barrel 2 and comparatively difficult twisting-out of the rotating connection 8, 15.
