<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic material 
having an outer light-insensitive layer with improved antistatic and surface 
properties. The use of solid particles of water insoluble organic or inorganic 
materials, usually referred to as "matting agents", in silver halide photographic 
materials is widely known in the art. Matting agents are usually employed in the outer protective layer 
over the silver halide emulsion layer(s) and/or in a backing layer at the rear 
of the support to provide a rough surface which is often desirable in photographic 
art. Matting agents are mainly used to reduce the tackiness of the 
photographic material, for example when the material is in the form of a roll 
or a stack. They can also be used to provide a sufficient roughening of the 
surface to prevent the formation of Newton's rings when printing and enlarging 
by reduction of the contact surface between two adjacent photographic 
materials. Further, they can be used to decrease abrasion from 
dry-friction and to reduce scratching when materials are stored or packed in 
contact with other materials as is the case, for example, of X-ray material 
packed without interleaves. It is also possible to use matting agents to obtain 
the desired coefficient of friction for film materials intended for use in automatic 
apparatus for rapid or super-rapid processing. Moreover, matting 
agents may have a slight effect in reducing the generation of static electricity 
in photographic elements by reducing the area of contact between the surface 
of the photographic element and other materials, which can cause static 
discharge. The generation of static electricity can cause a large number of difficulties  
 
during the preparation and use of photographic elements, especially 
film elements. The generation of static electricity can be caused by rubbing 
of the element against rollers and other elements through or on which the 
materials are guided, by contact of the film element with rough surfaces or 
by many other known reasons. Discharges of static electricity in an unprocessed 
photographic element cause local film exposure and on development 
the discharge images become visible in the form of irregular streaks or 
lines and black spots. Discharges in a processed film element are also undesirable 
since friction can be increased. The reduction of static electricity provided by the matting agents is 
insufficient, if taken alone, to solve the problem of static marks as described 
above. In the art of
