 3- AND 3 , 8-SUBSTITUTED 1 , 10-PHENANTHROLINES AND THEIR USE IN ELECTRON AND ENERGY TRANSFER PROCESSESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to 1 ,10-phenanthrolιne derivatives substituted at the 3-, 8- positionsBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSelf-assembling supramolecular systems capable of photo-induced electron and energy transfer, and molecular arrays displaying non-linear optical (NLO) properties, exemplify key design targets in materials chemistry For leading references discussing supramolecular chemistry, see (a) Lehn, J -M Angew Chem Int Ed Engl 1990, 29, 1304-1319 (b) Balzani, V , Scandola, F Supramolecular Photochemistry Ellis Horwood, New York, 1991 (c) Schneider, H -J , Durr, H (Eds) Frontiers in Supramolecular Organic Chemistry and Photochemistry, VCH, Weinheim, 1991 For a leading reference discussing assemblies with optical non-linearities, see Marks, T J , Ratner, M A Angew Chem Int Ed Engl 1995, 34, 155-173, and references cited therein The incorporation of transition metal ions into polymers provides unique opportunities to control the electrical, magnetic and optical properties of the metals The major approaches taken to date involve incorporating metal ions as side groups attached to the backbone (e g polyvinylferrocene), or as part of the polymer mam chain (e g metallynes) These approaches do not provide full control of the physical properties of the resulting materials and in most cases are not amendable for the synthesis of conducting polymers, as the metal containing polymers are non conjugatedRuthenium coordination compounds play a central role in these systems, for example, ruthenium complexes of polypyπdine ligands are potential building blocks for luminescent and redox active assemblies as well as for "molecular wires" For an excellent review of the photophysics and photochemistry of Ru(ll) polypyπdine complexes, see Juris, A , Balzani, V , Baπgelletti, F , Campagna, S , Belser, P , Von Zelewsky, A Coord Chem Rev 1988, 84, 85-277 For some selected examples for the construction of multinuclear ruthenium complexes, see (a) Grosshenny, V , Ziessel, R J Organometallic Chem 1993, 453, C19-C22 (b) Romero, F M , Ziessel, R Tetrahedron Lett
