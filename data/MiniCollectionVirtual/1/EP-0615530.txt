<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to elastomeric
rubber based pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions
used in label and tape manufacture where the adhesive
employed has improved cuttability and therefore
convertability.During the process of converting pressure-sensitive
bulk products such as rolls of a laminate of
a face stock or backing, a pressure-sensitive adhesive
layer, and a release liner into end products, many
cutting operations are performed. These include
slitting, sheeting, guillotining including hole
punching and perforating, and die cutting on rotary and
flat-bed machines.Die cutting for label manufacture is the most
complex. There, a laminate of a face stock or backing,
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer and a release liner
is passed through apparatus which converts the laminate
to yield commercially useful labels from label stock. 
The processes involved in converting operations include
printing, die cutting and matrix stripping to leave
labels on a release liner, butt cutting of labels to
the release liner, marginal hole punching, perforating,
fan folding, guillotining and the like.Die and butt cutting involve cutting of the
laminate to the face of the release liner. Other
procedures involve cutting clean through the label
laminate and include hole punching, perforating and
guillotining.The cost of converting a laminate into a finished
product is a function of the speed at which the various
processing operations occur. While the nature of all
layers of the laminate can impact cost of
convertability, the adhesive layer has been the
greatest limiting factor in ease and cost of
convertability. This is in consequence of its
viscoelastic nature which hampers precise and clean
penetration of a die in die cutting operations and
promotes adherence of the adhesive to cutting blades
and the like in converting operations.For slitting and sheeting, the cutting blade,
because of adhesive adherence, becomes tacky and forms
so called "gum balls." The gum balls transfer to the
surface of paper and produce product defects. Quite
often, the operators have to stop the cutting operation
and clean the blade. Placing a lubricant such as
mineral oil on the surface of the blade can help the
cutting process.For die cutting, poor cutting causes matrix breaks
when waste matrix is peeled off. In order to avoid the
matrix breaks, the press operators are forced to lower
the converting speed.For guillotining where stacks of sheets are cut at
the same time, the cutting edge of the paper tends to
become tacky. As a
