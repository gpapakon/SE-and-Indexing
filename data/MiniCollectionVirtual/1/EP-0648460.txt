<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a collapsible barbecue 
grill. Barbecue grills are very popular in countries all over 
the world where people want to enjoy the special flavor of 
barbecued food. Many people have collapsible barbecue 
grills which can be wheeled to different areas such as a 
patio of a house or a picnic site in the countryside. However, in order to store or transport the grill, it 
is preferred that it can be collapsed to occupy less space. 
And further, when it is in a collapsed mode, it is desired 
that the grill can be maneuvered easily by means of useful 
handles appropriately located thereon. It is also further 
found that locking devices to secure the legs in both open 
and retracted positions are necessary for safe and practical 
operation. Thus, there has been a long and unfulfilled need 
for a collapsible barbecue grill in which there are foldable 
legs which can be secured by locking devices and at least 
two separate handles to maneuver the grill easily. The present invention provides a collapsible barbecue 
grill including an oven mounted on a stand comprising a top 
rack, a first pair of legs pivotally linked to the top rack 
by means of a pair of L-shaped knuckles, a second pair of 
legs pivotally linked to the top rack by means of a pair of  
 
L-shaped knuckles, four L-shaped brackets each attached to 
one of the legs and a bottom rack mounted on the L-shaped 
brackets. The first pair of legs comprising a telescopic 
configuration. Each L-shaped knuckle cooperates with a 
corresponding sprung loaded element received inside the top 
rack whereby each leg may be locked in an extended position. 
Each L-shaped knuckle comprises a sleeve and two arms 
perpendicularly extending from the sleeve. The arms are 
pivotally linked to the top rack. Each leg is inserted in 
the sleeve of a corresponding L-shaped knuckle. One of the 
arms of each L-shaped knuckle has a hole formed therein for 
receiving a latch projecting from a corresponding sprung 
loaded element. Two wheels are mounted an axle attached to 
the second pair of wheels. The bottom rack comprises four 
dowels attached to the underside thereof and each L-shaped 
bracket comprises a hole formed therein. The dowels 
attached to the bottom rack are insertable in the holes 
formed in the L-shaped brackets in order to retain the 
bottom rack on the L-shaped brackets. Further, the second pair of legs can also be pivoted 
upwards and also be attached to the underside of the stand.
