Cyclic depsipeptides having 18 ring atoms, of the
general formula (I)



in which

R
represents hydrogen, straight-chain or branched
or cyclic alkyl having up to 8 carbon atoms

and their optical isomers and racemates.
Process for the preparation of the cyclic depsipeptides
having 18 ring atoms, of the general

formula (I) according to Claim 1 


in which

R
represents hydrogen, straight-chain or branched
or cyclic alkyl having up to 8 carbon atoms

and their optical isomers and racemates,

characterized in that

open-chain hexadepsipeptides of the general formula
(II)



in which

one of the radicals R
1
, R
2
 and R
3
 represents
hydrogen, straight-chain or branched or cyclic

alkyl having up to 8 carbon atoms and the two other
radicals represent methyl and sec-butyl, are

subjected to a cyclization reaction in the presence
of a suitable coupling reagent, in the presence of

a basic reaction auxiliary and in the presence of a
diluent. 
Endoparasiticidal compositions, characterized in
that they contain at least one cyclic hexadepsipeptide

of the formula (I) according to Claim 1.
Process for the preparation of endoparasiticidal
compositions, characterized in that cyclic hexadepsipeptides

of the formula (I) according to
Claim 1 are mixed with extenders and/or

surfactants.
Use of cyclic hexadepsipeptides of the formula (I)
according to Claim 1 for the preparation of

endoparasiticidal compositions.
