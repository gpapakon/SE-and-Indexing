<ABSTRACT>
Improved optical mode mixers (52) for use in conjunction with optical fibers (64) and devices incorporating optical fibers are disclosed and claimed. The optical mode mixers (52) are formed from a coherent, orderly bundle of numerous small diameter optical fibers (64) in a longitudinally aligned, parallel array. The mode mixer (52) is optically linked to the fiber optic cable (36) and effectively reduces undesirable high order modes of light transmission while eliminating alignment sensitivity. The coherent fiber optic bundles may be as short as ten wavelengths of light in length and will have a diameter substantially equal to that of the fiber optic cable (36) to which they are coupled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to fiber optic light
transmission
which
reduces or eliminates high order mode transmission forms. In
particular, the present invention relates to an optical coupler having an optical mode mixer.The utilization of light conducting optical fibers to
transmit light is well known in the art. The applicability and
utilization of fiber optic cables and fibers is presently
reaching into virtually every facet of day to day life. Fiber
optics are small, flexible, insensitive to electromagnetic
fields, and transmit vast quantities of information relative
to conventional metallic conductors. As a result, considerable
development has been directed toward incorporating fiber optics
into a wide variety of systems including telecommunications,
computers, and medical devices.Typically, optical cables are formed of glass or plastic
clad cores which themselves are made of glass or plastic have
been drawn into relatively uniform, small diameter cables or
fibers. The most commonly available in the market place are
the multimode fibers that will propagate light in a mixture of
low and high order modes simultaneously (high and low order
modes refer to the-angle of propagation of light within the
fiber). Single mode fibers are also available for those
applications where the modal interference associated with
multimode fibers is undesirable.In some applications fiber composition or geometry and
external factors such as microbends or splices may be
responsible for increased attenuation of higher order modes of
transmission. Additionally, the modal distribution may vary
along the length of the fiber due to these internal and
external factors.Accordingly, early practitioners in the art performed
accurate transmission measurements on both multimode and single 
mode fibers in order to compensate for and reduce the influence
of external factors on transmission readings. Alternatively,
the multimode propagation effects associated with external
factors such as light launching conditions, bends or changes
in geometry may be accounted for by allowing the mode
distribution to reach an equilibrium or steady-state
distribution. This distribution generally occurs automatically
after propagation has taken place over a certain fiber length
depending upon the strength of the mode coupling within the
particular fiber. At equilibrium the mode distribution
propagates unchanged. As a result, the fiber attenuation and
dispersion effects assume consistent or well-defined values.Unfortunately, in order to reach
