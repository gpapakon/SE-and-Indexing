<ABSTRACT>
An extruded aluminium trough-shaped body part (10) 
for a vehicle occupant inflatable air bag restraining 

system has side walls (30,32) defining a cavity for 
accommodating an air bag (60), side wall portions (20,22) 

defining an integral open generally circular inflator 
holder and end plate attachment preparations in the form of 

screw slots. The body part (10) also includes internal 
attachment sleeves (94) for mounting an air bag 

retainer/diffuser (90) and gas cooling cavities (108) 
containing thermally conductive material (109) and provided 

with rearwardly facing vent holes (106). An inflator is 
held in the inflator holder (18) by end plates screwed to 

the attachment preparations at each end of the body part 
(10). A separate end base may project through each end 

plate to engage an end of an inflator by means of a 
projection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inflatable passive
restraint systems for use in vehicles for restraining the
movement of a seated occupant during a collision and,
more particularly, to an improvement in the structure for
housing and positioning a gas generator and inflatable
bag in the vehicle.Safety restraint systems which self-actuate from an
undeployed to a deployed state without the need for
intervention by the operator, i.e., "passive restraint systems",
and particularly those restraint systems incorporating
inflatable bags or cushions, as well as the use of
such systems in motor vehicles have been the subjects
of much discussion as the desirability of the use of such
passive restraint systems has gained general acceptance
in the United States.It is well known to protect a vehide occupant using
a cushion or bag that is inflated with gas, e.g., an "inflatable
bag" or, commonly referred to as an "air bag",
when the vehicle encounters sudden deceleration, such
as in a collision. During deployment, the rapidly evolving
gas with which the bag is typically filled is an inert gas,
e.g., nitrogen. In such systems, the inflatable bag is normally
housed in an uninflated and folded condition to
minimize space requirements. Upon actuation of the
restraint system, gas is discharged from an inflator to
rapidly inflate the bag. The bag can then serve to
restrain the movement of the vehicle occupant as the
collision proceeds.Vehicular inflatable restraint systems generally
include multiple crash sensors generally positioned
about or mounted to the frame and/or body of the subject
vehicle and serve to sense sudden decelerations by
the vehide. In turn, the sensor sends a signal to an
inflatable bag module/assembly strategically positioned
within the riding compartment of the vehicle to actuate
deployment of the air bag. In general, an inflatable bag
provided for the protection of a vehicle driver, i.e., a
driver side air bag, is mounted in a storage compartment
located in the steering column of the vehicle.
Whereas, an inflatable bag for the protection of a front
seat passenger, i.e., a passenger side air bag, is typically
mounted in the instrument panel/dash board of the
vehicle.Typical inflatable passive restraint systems make
use of an air bag module which generally includes an
outer reaction housing or canister, commonly referred to
as a "reaction can" or, more briefly, as a "can". The reaction
canister generally serves to support or contain
other components of the air bag module system, including
what is
