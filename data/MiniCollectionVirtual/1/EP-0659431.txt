<ABSTRACT>
A compound isolated from 
Ervatamia microphylla
 has 
been found to be effective in inducing a change in cell 

morphology and growth habits of cultured transformant cell 
lines, and in reducing the tumor size in a living mammal. 

The compound is capable of inhibiting the function of 
oncogenes such as ras and 
src
 by inhibiting the function of 
the oncogene products. The compound is found to be 

represented by formula (I): 

Use of the compound as an oncogene function inhibitor, in a 
treatment of cancer, and in inducing changes in cell 

morphology and growth habits in transformant cell line are 
contemplated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carcinostatic agent 
containing a compound having an activity to inhibit the 
function of an oncogene as an effective component. More 
specifically, this invention is directed to a carcinostatic 
agent which is capable of inhibiting the function of ras 
and src oncogenes through inhibition of the function of the 
oncogene products thereof. This invention also relates to 
a method for inhibiting such oncogene function and a method 
for normalizing cell morphology and growth habits of cancer 
cells. Furthermore, this invention relates to the use of 
said compound for the preparation of a drug useful for 
treating cancer in a mammal. This invention involves use of 
a compound extracted from Ervatamia microphylla. Oncogenes play important roles in the initiation and 
promotion of cancers. An oncogene is generated by 
conversion of a protooncogene on a genome DNA of a normal 
cell through various abnormalities such as point mutation, 
translocation, and amplification. Of the more than 70 
oncogenes that have so far been found, ras oncogenes are 
some of the most popular oncogenes, and are said to be 
found in about 20% of human tissues of colon cancer, breast  
 
cancer, leukemia, and the like. In view of such situation, 
substances that are capable of inhibiting the action of the 
ras and other oncogenes, namely, that are capable of 
inhibiting the function of the product of ras and other 
oncogenes is highly awaited as a new series of therapeutic 
agents. The presently known substances that are capable of 
inhibiting the action of the ras oncogene product, namely, 
Ras protein include oxanosin isolated from Actynomyces (N. 
Shimada et al., The Journal of Antibiotics 34, 1216-1218, 
1981) and compactin isolated from a mold (O. Ito et al., 
Cancer Research 49, 996-1000, 1989). Such known substances capable of inhibiting the action 
of the ras oncogene products, however, suffer from low 
stability and high toxicity, and none are clinically 
applicable. Development of a new medicament that is 
clinically applicable, and that has an inhibitory mechanism 
different from such known oncogene inhibitors is highly 
demanded. In order to find an oncogene inhibitory substance of 
clinical utility, the inventors of the present invention 
have conducted a screening of substances of plant origin in 
search for a substance that is capable of inhibiting the 
action of ras and other oncogenes by using normalization of 
cell morphology and growth habits for the index, and 
consequently, found that
