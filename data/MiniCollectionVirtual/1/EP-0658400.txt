<ABSTRACT>
A polishing apparatus (10) for polishing a surface of a 
workpiece such as a semiconductor wafer is installed in a clean 

room (C). The polishing apparatus comprises a polishing section 
having a turntable (12) with an abrasive cloth mounted on an upper 

surface thereof, a top ring (11) for supporting the workpiece to be 
polished and pressing the workpiece against the abrasive cloth, 

a loading section for loading the workpiece to be polished onto 
the top ring, an unloading section for unloading the workpiece 

which has been polished from the top ring, a cover (17,18) which covers 
an entire moving a
rea of the top ring including the polishing 
section, the loading section and the unloading section, and an 

exhaust duct (19) for discharging air of an interior space of the 
cover to an outside of an installation space (20) of the polishing 

apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polishing
apparatus, and more particularly a polishing apparatus which
can be installed in a clean room.Recent rapid progress in semiconductor device
integration demands smaller and smaller wiring patterns or
interconnections and also narrower spaces between
interconnections which connect active areas. One of the
processes available for forming such interconnection is
photolithography. Though the photolithographic process can
form interconnections that are at most 0.5 µm wide, it requires
that surfaces on which pattern images are to be focused on by
a stepper be as flat as possible because the depth of focus of
the optical system is relatively small.It is therefore necessary to make the surfaces of
semiconductor wafers flat for photolithography. One customary
way of flattening the surfaces of semiconductor wafers is to
polish them with a polishing apparatus.Conventionally, such a polishing apparatus has not
been installed in a clean room because dust particles and
harmful gas are generated by polishing operation from the
polishing apparatus. Therefore, semiconductor wafers are
transported into the clean room by means of a wafer carrier
after they are polished by the polishing apparatus installed
outside the clean room, and then the semiconductor wafers are 
processed to form device layers by processing apparatuses
installed in the clean room.However, as described above, high integration in a
semiconductor device demands the semiconductor wafer to be
multilayer, it is therefore necessary to make each surface of
the multilayer flat for photolithography. In order to increase
the productivity of the semiconductor device, the polishing
apparatus is required to be installed in the clean room of a
semiconductor manufacturing plant.However, in the case where a conventional polishing
apparatus is installed in the clean room, dust particles and
harmful gas generated by polishing operation pollutes air in
the clean room.Further, in the polishing apparatus, abrasive liquid
is supplied from a nozzle onto an abrasive cloth attached to an
upper surface of a turntable. The abrasive liquid contains
abrasive material such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) or cerium
dioxide (CeO2) having a diameter of 1 µm or less in a liquid.Furthermore, in order to perform chemical polishing
in addition to mechanical polishing, acid or alkali may be
added to the abrasive liquid. In this case, acid waste gas or
alkaline waste gas or mist is liable to be discharged from the
polishing apparatus.However, in the
