<ABSTRACT>
Heavy metal contaminants are immobilised from raffinates containing acids of phosphorus. The raffinates are neutralised to form agglomerates and the agglomerates are then treated to form a solid, rock-like material in which the heavy metal contaminants are permanently encapsulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the immobilisation of metal contaminants 
from a liquid to a solid medium and in particular to a method for the 
immobilisation of heavy metal contaminants from a liquid medium 
containing acids of phosphorus. The present invention will be described herein with particular 
reference to the immobilisation of heavy metal contaminants from 
acidic raffinates generated during the commerical production of 
phosphoric acid, but is not to be construed as being limited thereto. Phosphoric acid is used in the manufacture of neutral phosphates and 
polyphosphates, which in turn find wide application in the food and 
detergent industries. Phosphoric acid is obtained from naturally-occurring phosphate-containing 
rock. The rock is mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid 
and the crude phosphoric acid thus produced is removed, leaving behind 
a gypsum slurry waste stream. The crude phosphoric acid is then 
extracted into an organic solvent, from which it is subsequently 
stripped to produce purified phosphoric acid. The purification process leads to generation of a secondary phosphoric 
acid stream (the underflow), which contains a large proportion of the 
various contaminants, including heavy metals, originally present in 
the phosphate rock. The secondary phosphoric acid stream is treated in a second extraction 
plant, where residual phosphoric acid is extracted for re-use. The 
heavy metal contaminants, together with some residual phosphorus 
(present as phosphoric acid), remain in a sulphuric acid-rich stream 
(raffinate).  
 Hitherto, the raffinate has been treated by partial neutralization as 
a slurry followed by discharge to the sea. Although the level of 
heavy metal contaminants in the discharge has been kept within the 
prescribed limits laid down by the appropriate authority, there is 
pressure to reduce such sea discharge, necessitating 
alternative methods of disposal.  
 EP-A-0 017 741 discloses a process to purify phosphoric 
acid which leads to the production of an aqueous 
raffinate to which calcium hydroxide is added. The resulting 
suspension is filtered to produce a filter cake. EP-A-0 189 062 discloses the conversion of heavy metal 
containing phosphoric acid residues into solid dumpable 
products by the addition of calcium hydroxide to the 
filtered residues. US-A-4 200 620 discloses the purification of 
wet-processed phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is 
extracted in two zones. The primary raffinate resulting 
from the first extraction passes to a second zone where

<CLAIMS>
A method for the immobilisation of heavy metal contaminants from 
a liquid medium containing approximately 40% by weight sulphuric acid and 

one or more acids of phosphorus, said 
method being 
characterised by
 the following steps: 

(a) neutralizing the liquid medium (e.g. an acidic raffinate generated 
during the purification of phosphoric acid) with a stoichiometric 

excess of an alkaline earth metal oxide to form agglomerates; 
(b) treating the agglomerates with water to form a solid cementitious 
material wherein the heavy metal contaminants are substantially 

chemically isolated. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the raffinate also 
contains approximately 

8% by weight phosphoric acid. 
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the raffinate 
contains at least 4% by weight phosphoric acid. 
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the 
alkaline earth metal oxide is calcium oxide. 
A method according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the ratio of 
liquid medium to calcium oxide is in the range 0.1:1 to 3.5:1 by 

weight, for example 2.6:1 to 3.1:1 by weight.
