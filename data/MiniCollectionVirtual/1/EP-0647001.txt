<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor optical amplifier comprises 
a substrate (1) and an active layer (4) constructed as a quantum 

well structure. The active layer includes a plurality 
of well layers (14,15) and a plurality of barrier layers (13a,13c) 

which are 
alternately layered. The composition of each well layer (14,15) 

is such that the well layers have different quantum 
levels. The barrier layers are subjected to biaxial 

strain to shift the energy band structures so as to 
eliminate the polarization dependency of optical gain 

in the active region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
optical device, such as a semiconductor optical amplifier. Generally, a semiconductor optical amplifier or 
amplifying apparatus is provided with a semiconductor 
laser structure which includes an active layer, a clad 
layer and the like. The semiconductor optical amplifier 
performs optical amplification for input light from outside, 
under bias current below its threshold injected 
thereinto. In optical communications, the optical 
amplifier has been developed as a device for compensating 
for optical loss which occurs in an optical fiber, at 
connections between fibers, etc. However, when such semiconductor optical amplifiers 
are used in optical fiber communication systems, 
there exists the problem of polarization dependency of 
an optical amplification factor (i.e., amplification 
factors differ for different polarization modes). 
In general, the polarization state of output light 
transmitted through the optical fiber fluctuates 
with time. As a result, if such output light is  
 
supplied to the above-mentioned optical amplifier 
with polarization dependency, the level of output light 
from the optical amplifier will be unstable and 
fluctuate with time. Therefore, a receiver system is 
required to have a wide dynamic range, and various burdens 
are imposed on the receiver system. This is a fatal 
drawback that limits the scale of optical systems 
or networks. Therefore, various efforts have been proposed 
for constructing a polarization insensitive optical 
amplifier (i.e., amplification factors for different 
polarization modes are substantially equal to each 
other). Among them, there has been proposed a method 
of using a strained quantum well structure for solving 
the polarization dependency of optical gain in its 
active layer. The strained quantum well structure has been 
used for controlling the oscillation wavelength and reducing 
the oscillation gain threshold in the field of 
semiconductor lasers as well as in the field of 
amplifiers, and thus the strained quantum well structure 
is a very useful technique. (see for example IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, 5 (1993) 4, pp. 406-407) Generally, the gain for transverse magnetic (TM) 
light is made equal to or larger than the gain for 
transverse electric (TE) light to achieve a polarization 
insensitive optical amplifier by using such a strained 
quantum well structure. In more detail, the degeneracy 
in a valence band is released by the effect of strain, and  
 
band structures of
