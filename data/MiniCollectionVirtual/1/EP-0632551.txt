<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve a laser amplifier system (10) having a solid body which comprises an active laser material (12) and is arranged in a laser radiation field (24), and having a pumping-light source (34) for pumping the active laser material (12), in such a way that the highest possible powers are achieved with the smallest possible crystal volume, it is proposed for the solid body to have a cooling surface (14), for the solid body to dissipate heat produced in it via the cooling surface (14) extensively to a massive cooling element (20), so that a temperature gradient is produced in the solid body towards the cooling surface (14), for the massive cooling element (20) to form a support for the solid body and for the laser-radiation field to propagate approximately parallel to the temperature gradient in the solid body.
