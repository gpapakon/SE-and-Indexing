 SILANES CARRYING ATER-SQLUBILIZING AND HYDROPHOBIC MOIETIESCross Reference to Related U.S. Patent Applications1. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. , filed concurrently herewith, of the same inventors herein for "Stable Aqueous Solutions Containing Siloxanes for Treating Wood" and2. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. filed concurrently herewith, of Wen Hsuan Chang, Marvin L. Kaufman andEdward E. McEntire, for "Vinyl Polymer Latex Systems".BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to new silanes carrying at least one anionic or nonionic water-solubilizing (hydrophilic) moiety and at least one hydrophobic moiety suitable for preparing stable aqueous solutions or dispersions containing in excess of about five weight percent of said silanes.Description of the Prior Art In Japanese Ko ai Patent No. SHO 69(1985)-42437 there is disclosed the reaction of silica with a silane coupling agent carrying an amino group and the subsequent reaction of the product obtained with an anhydride to obtain silica-containing compounds. Plueddemann in U.S. Patent No. 4,718,944 discloses the reaction product of maleic anhydride and a diamine functional silane compound to obtain an ■ amide-acid product containing silane but devoid of hydrophobic moieties or neutralizing moieties. Holub et al in U.S. Patent No. 3,755,354 are interested in imido-substituted organosilanes and an intermediate amide acid devoid of neutralizing moieties. None of these references relates to new silanes carrying at least one neutralized anionic or nonionic water-solubilizing moiety and at least one hydrophobic moiety suitable for the preparation of stable aqueous solutions or dispersions containing in excess of about five weight percent of said novel silanes. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The novel silanes claimed herein carrying at least one anionic or nonionic water-solubilizing moiety and at least one hydrophobic moiety can be defined by the following structural formula:
 whereinR1 represents a monovalent organic moiety having from 6 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably from 7 to 20 carbon atoms,such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl radicals, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, such as 0, N or S and functional groups, such as OH, CO,, ethers, amines, amides or carbon-to-carbon double bonds;R" represents a divalent organic moiety, such as alkylidene, cycloalkylidene, arylidene, alkarylidene or aralkylidene radicals, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, such as 0, N or S, and functional groups,
