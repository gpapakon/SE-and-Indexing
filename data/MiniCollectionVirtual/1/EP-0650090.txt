<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phase shifting
mask and a manufacturing method thereof as well as an
exposure method using such a phase shifting mask.In semiconductor integrated circuitry, so many
developments have been made for high integration and
miniaturisation. Accordingly, the rapid development has
been made for miniaturization of a circuit pattern which
is formed on a semiconductor substrate (hereinafter
referred merely to as a wafer).Among-other things, photolithography has been
recognized widely as the basic technology for pattern
formation, in which various developments and improvements
have already been made. However, as miniaturization of
patterns proceeds, an improvement of resolution of the
pattern is strongly required.Photography is a technology for transferring a mask
(original) pattern on a photoresist applied on a wafer and
patterning an underlying film to be etched. When
transferring the photoresist, the photoresist is 
developed. During development, the photoresist of the
type in which a portion exposed to light is removed is
called a positive type photoresist, while the type in
which a portion not exposed to light is removed is called
a negative type. Now, a conventional exposure method
utilizing the photolithography technology will be
described.Fig. 45 is a schematic diagram of an optical system
for illustrating a conventional exposure method. In this
optical system, referring to Fig. 45, a pattern on a mask
is reduced and projected onto a photoresist placed on the
wafer. The optical system includes an illumination
optical system covering from a light source to a photomask
pattern, and a projection optical system covering from the
photomask pattern to the wafer.The illumination optical system includes a mercury
lamp 111 serving as a light source, a reflection mirror
112, a light collecting lens 118, a fly eye lenses 113, a
diaphragm 114b, light collecting lenses 116a-116c, a blind
diaphragm 115, and a reflection mirror 117. The
projection optical system includes telephoto lenses
119a-119b and a diaphragm 125.In exposure operation, a beam of light 111a emitted
from mercury lamp 111 is reflected from reflection mirror
112, so that only a g-line (wavelength:436nm), for 
example, is reflected to become a beam of light having a
single wavelength. Beam of light 111a then enters each
lens 113a constituting fly eye lens 113, and after that,
passes through diaphragm 114b.Light passes through a light path 111b produced by
one lens 113a constituting the fly eye lens, and light
passes
