<ABSTRACT>
A carrier having small weight and high water and fertilizer holding properties, and capable of immobilizing a 
large quantity of plant cultivating culture medium, which can be disposed of simply after it has been used, and which 

does not give rise to any environmental problems, and also a large quantity of microorganisms, greatly improving the 
survival rate of microorganisms which have been preserved for a long period of time, and being used as a microorganism 

immobilizing carrier capable of greatly improving the establishing rate and reproductive rate of microorganisms. The 
carrier contains polysaccharide and lignin as main components, and has cellular structures in the inner portion thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a matrix and 
agricultural materials. The usual medium for cultivation of plants is 
soil and actually soil has been utilized in the 
cultivation of plants on farms and in pots. It is no 
wonder that soil is used as the basal culture medium for 
plants but for a variety of reasons such as the incidence 
of damages due to pests inhabiting the soil, limited 
availability of fertile soil, labor involved in cultivation 
management, etc., greenhouse farming not utilizing 
soil has also become the order of the day in recent 
years. For example, a host of culture media such as rock 
wool, peat moss, vermiculite, etc. are available as 
substitutes for soil. However, whereas these media not 
utilizing soil have the advantage of being lightweight 
compared with soil, they are seriously handicapped in 
fertilizer-holding capacity and unavoidably require 
additional application of fertilizers. Moreover, any 
medium not utilizing soil is poor in moisture retention 
and/or has the problem of disposal after use. 
Particularly from the environmental point of view,  
 
disposal of used media is an important consideration. Meanwhile, the soil used for growing plants is 
inhabited by useful microorganisms which are adapting it 
to the cultivation of plants. However, when the useful 
microorganisms in the soil have been depleted on repeated 
cultivation or in cultivation on soil inherently unsuited 
for cultivation of plants, it is common practice to 
employ some or other soil conditioner for rejuvenating 
the soil into a condition suited for cultivation. Such 
soil conditioners are put to use by dusting them over 
soil or mixing them with soil for the purpose of 
promoting growth of crop plants and controlling pest 
hazards. As soil conditioners, those containing natural 
organic matter are frequently used for assisting in the 
growth of useful microorganisms. Moreover, in order that 
useful microorganisms may be directly incorporated in the 
soil, soil conditioners having microorganisms adsorbed 
thereon have also been developed. The soil conditioners 
commercially available under the tradenames of "Bio-Yuki", 
"Nenisoil", "Cobshut", etc. comprise useful 
microorganisms adsorbed on porous mineral supports. 
However, since the supports used for immobilizing 
microorganisms in these soil conditioners are minerals, 
they have the drawback that no sufficient colonization of  
 
microorganisms can be expected with such a support alone. 
Therefore, for aiding in the colorization and 
multiplication of
