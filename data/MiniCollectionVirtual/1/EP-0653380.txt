<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an oxygenation device for water 
treatment plants, as set forth in the main claim. The oxygenation device according to the invention is 
applied to aeration tanks containing waters which have to be 
treated before discharge, whether those waters are of a 
household origin, an industrial origin, an agricultural 
origin or combined origins. The oxygenation device according to the invention is 
applied also to aeration tanks containing waters to be 
treated for re-use in other fields. Plants have been disclosed for the treatment of waters 
which have to be treated before being discharged or being 
re-used, such plants comprising a plurality of tanks 
positioned in series, through which the water is caused to 
run and generally passes from one tank to the next tank by 
gravity. In a treatment step it is generally necessary to increase 
the concentration of oxygen in the water for various 
reasons, amongst which is the avoidance of anaerobic 
phenomena with the emission of evil smells. The oxygenation devices of the state of the art are 
employed in the aeration tanks of the plants to treat water 
before discharge or of plants to treat water for re-use, the 
purposes being to provide the oxygen required for the aerobe 
bacteria which attack the organic biodegradable substances, 
to oxidise the inorganic reducing substances, to volatilise 
and therefore to remove from the solutions the harmful 
substances such as ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, hydrocyanic 
acid, acetone, etc. and to separate suspended or emulsified 
substances so as to enhance flotation. Various methods have been disclosed which are commonly  
 
used in the process of oxygenating the water. A first method consists in carrying out the oxygenation by 
gravity by causing the water to fall by gravity through 
columns which are advantageously equipped with internal 
obstructions, which have the task of fractionating the water 
by making it meet in countercurrent a flow of forced draught 
blown upwards from below. This system, however, requires a 
great space and high costs and the efficiency of the 
air/water exchange is very low. A second method consists in the mechanical aeration of the 
water, for instance by means of rotary cylindrical brushes 
fitted horizontally and semi-submersed, these brushes 
stirring the water and spraying an appreciable quantity of 
the water into the air, thus enhancing the exchange with the 
air. Other systems include the use of turbine aeration means to 
diffuse the oxygen in the water, but
