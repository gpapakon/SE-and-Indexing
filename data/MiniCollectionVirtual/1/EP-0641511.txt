<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a lighting arrangement with variable luminous intensity and colour, containing a lighting unit (10) with gas-discharge tubes (11R, 11B, 11G) and with a control and power supply unit (30) attached to it. The essence of the invention is that the lighting unit (10) contains at least one light source (12) radiating light of variable luminous intensity and colour in a wide solid angle and has at least three gas discharge tubes (11R, 11B, 11G) of like design and of different colour; that the control and power supply unit (30) contains a receiver, preferably an infrared receiver (35), a decoder and a supply unit, preferably a switching supply unit (34); and that the arrangement is equipped with a remote control unit (20) establishing an unwired connection with the receiver and having a keyboard (24) enabling one to regulate luminous intensity and/or color.

Lighting arrangement for general lighting purposes with variable light intensity
and color, which comprises a lighting unit made of gas-discharge tubes and a control

and power supply unit coupled to the lighting unit, the lighting unit (10) comprises at
least one light source (12) emitting light with variable intensity and color, which

comprises at least three gas discharge tubes (11R, 11B, 11G) of identical design and
differing color, characterized in that the control and power supply unit (30) comprises

a receiver, a decoder and a power supply unit, and the arrangement comprises a remote
control unit (20) coupled by means of a wireless connection to the receiver and

comprises keys (24) that enable the control of the light intensity and of the color.
The arrangement as claimed in claim 1, wherein the lighting unit (10) is designed
as a ceiling, wall or standing lamp.
The arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the power supply unit is
designed as a power supply unit (34) operating is switching mode.
The arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the control and
power supply unit (30) is arranged in the lighting unit (10) or in the proximity thereof.
The arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the electrical feeding
line of the control and power supply unit (30) is connected to a switch (31).
The arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the control and
power supply unit (30) has a digital design and comprises EPROM and RAM

memories (44, 45) and the remote control unit (20) comprises a memory (26). 
The arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
arrangement comprises in a common room a plurality of lighting units (10), respective

control and power supply units (30) associated directly with and arranged in the close
proximity of said lighting units (10), and a common remote control unit (20).
The arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
receiver is an infrared receiver (35) and the remote control unit (20) comprises an

infrared transmitter (21).
