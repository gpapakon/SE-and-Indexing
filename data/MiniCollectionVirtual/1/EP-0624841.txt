<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for filtering production rules expressing conditions to be satisfied and intended to identify in the course of successive inference cycles of rules, the rule(s) whose conditions are satisfied in respect of deduced facts and comprising a sorting system for ordering the conditions of the rules as a function of a sorting criterion so as to check the conditions of the rules on the basis of an order for taking the said conditions into account. The filtering mechanism is devised so as to trigger the system for sorting the conditions of the rules only when the number of facts satisfying a condition of a rule is multiplied or divided by an adjustable factor K between the current inference cycle and the last previous inference cycle in the course of which the sorting system was triggered in respect of this rule.

A mechanism for filtering production rules
expressing conditions (2) to be satisfied adapted to identify

during successive inference cycles (1) rule(s) whose
conditions are satisfied for deduced facts (4) and comprising

a sorting system (32) for ordering the conditions of the rules
in accordance with a sorting criterion in order to verify the

conditions of the rules on the basis of an order to take
account of said conditions, characterised in that the filter

mechanism is adapted to activate the system for sorting the
conditions of the rules only if the number of facts which

satisfy a condition of a rule is multiplied or divided in a
ratio greater than a variable factor K between the current

inference cycle and the last preceding inference cycle during
which the sorting system was activated for this rule.
The mechanism according to claim 1 wherein said
sorting system is adapted to memorise an ordered list of the

other conditions of said rule for each condition of a rule.
The mechanism according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein
the criteria for sorting the conditions of a rule is defined

as follows:

a) the first condition of the rule is the one which must
be verified for a new deduced fact;
b) the next condition is selected from the remaining
conditions of the rule, this condition being the one which

satisfies one of the following criteria in the following order
of preference:


i) a condition that does not include any variable;
ii) a condition including at least one variable present
in a condition already selected;
iii) a condition including at least one variable and for
which the number of constrained facts is the smallest.
A mechanism for filtering production rules according
to any one of the preceding claims used by the inference

engine of an expert system. 
An expert system inference engine comprising a
mechanism for filtering production rules expressing conditions

(2) to be satisfied, adapted to identify during successive
inference cycles (1) rule(s) whose conditions are satisfied

for deduced facts (4) and comprising a sorting system (32) for
ordering the conditions of the rules in accordance with a

sorting criterion in order to verify the conditions of the
rules on the basis of an order to take account of said

conditions, such that the filter mechanism is adapted to
activate the system for sorting the conditions of the rules

only if the number of facts which satisfy a condition of a
rule is multiplied or divided in a ratio greater than a

variable factor K between the current inference cycle and the
last preceding inference cycle during which the sorting system

was activated for this rule.
