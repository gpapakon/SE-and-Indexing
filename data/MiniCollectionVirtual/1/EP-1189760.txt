<ABSTRACT>
A black matrix can be formed by thermal transfer on a receptor substrate for use, for example, in a display application. This black matrix can be used, for example, as a color filter black matrix or a TFT (thin film transistor) black matrix to provide contrast and/or to separate adjacent electrically-conducting components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the thermal transfer of a black matrix onto a receptor and
related thermal transfer donor sheets and products made therefrom. In particular, the
invention relates to the thermal transfer of a black matrix onto a receptor using a thermal
transfer donor sheet having a donor layer that includes carbon black.Black matrix coatings are used in many display applications to absorb ambient
light and improve contrast. The black matrix is formed around individual pixels or light
emitters of the display. In many liquid crystal displays (LCDs), the black matrix is a 0.1
to 0.2 µm coating of black chromium oxide on a display substrate. Black chromium oxide
is typically sputtered onto the display substrate which is a relatively expensive process. In
addition, the black chromium oxide typically forms a metallic surface with higher than
desired reflectivity (and correspondingly reduced contrast). Furthermore, there are
environmental and health concerns associated with chromium.A resin black matrix (a pigment in a resin matrix) has been suggested as an
alternative to black chromium oxide. The resin black matrix is coated onto the display
substrate and then patterned using photolithography. To achieve a high optical density in
a thin resin black matrix coating, it is typically necessary to use relatively high pigment
loadings. This makes photolithography difficult because the patterning light (e.g.,
ultraviolet (UV) light) typically does not penetrate well into coatings with high optical
densities. In addition, coatings with high levels of pigment have less resin. Because resin
is the component of a coating that is etched, high optical density coatings (i.e., coatings
with high pigment content) may not etch cleanly. WO-A-96/01718 relates to a method for the manufacture of a matrix on a
substrate, wherein the matrix is particularly useful in the formation of colour filter
elements, the process comprising the steps of providing an imagable article
comprising a substrate having on at least one surface thereof a black layer, and
directing energy of sufficient intensity at the black layer to transparentize the black
layer. The directing of energy is done so that the black layer is removed in some
areas, but is not removed in other areas so that borders of black layer surround
areas from which black layer has been removed.US-A-5 689 318 describes a colour liquid crystal display device comprising a
colour filter having a structure including a black matrix formed on a transparent
substrate, a coloured
