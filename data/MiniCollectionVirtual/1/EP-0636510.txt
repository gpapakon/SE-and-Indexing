<ABSTRACT>
Articulation (hinge fitting) for a vehicle seat including a flange (1) fixed to a seat framework, a moving flange (7) integral with another framework of the seat, a cup (3) allowing the moving flange (7) an orbital movement giving rise to the angular movement of the hinge, and a cup (14) holding the moving flange (7) against the fixed flange (1), characterised in that the edge of this cup has external toothing which interacts with toothing (10) carried by the half-cutouts (9) of the moving flange (7), the height of the toothing (18) on the edge of the cup (14) and of the toothing in the half-cutouts (9) being equal to twice the distance between centres of the two shoulders (4, 5) of the dish (3).

A hinge fitting for vehicule seat comprising a fixed flange
(1) rigidly connected to one framework of a seat and carrying

an outer toothing (11), a mobile flange (7) rigidly connected
to another framework of the seat and carrying an inner

toothing (13), this inner toothing (13) cooperating with the
outer toothing (11) of the fixed flange (1), a cup member (3)

having two shoulders (4, 5) ensuring to the mobile flange an
orbital movement causing the angular movement of the hinge

fitting, and a dish member (14) connected to the fixed flange
and maintaining the mobile flange (7) against the fixed

flange (1), characterized in that the edge of this dish
member carries an inner toothing (18) that cooperates with

outer toothings (10) carried by semi-cut portions (9) of the
mobile flange (7), the height of the toothings (18) of the

edge of the dish member (14) and toothings (10) of the
semi-cut portions (9) being equal to twice the off-center 
e

provided between the two shoulders (4, 5) of the cup member
(3).
