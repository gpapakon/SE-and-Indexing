<ABSTRACT>
A device for the production of corrugated cardboard with
a single flat surface, wherein the marks of the junction

lines of the crests of the first permanently corrugated
cardboard ribbon (8) with the second flat cardboard

ribbon (10) are invisible and the cardboard's mechanical
strength within the same is not reduced, in which the

corrugating cylinders (2, 3) corrugate and preheat the
first cardboard ribbon (7) and overlay it on the flat

cardboard ribbon (9). The first contact between the two
ribbons occurs on the heating cylinder (4), keeping only

the second ribbon in a stretched and heated condition
while the first cardboard ribbon is not subjected to any

pulling or stretching force capable of altering it. The
coupling thus occurs without the application of any

direct or indirect pressure during the gluing process,
which is the source of the undesired phenomenon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a device for the production of
corrugated cardboard with a single flat surface.The machines producing such a cardboard generally
comprise as essential elements a pair of corrugating
cylinders, a glue applying cylinder and a pressing
cylinder. In the cardboard production process, a first
cardboard ribbon is corrugated by a pressure
simultaneously exerted on it by a pair of corrugating
cylinders. The glue applying cylinder then applies the
glue on the crests of the corrugations and the pressing
cylinder applies a second flat cardboard ribbon under
pressure on the crests of the first corrugated cardboard
ribbon. During this operation, said ribbon crests are
internally supported by the corresponding projections of
the corrugating cylinder. The final adhesion is achieved
by pressing and heating the glue spread between the
ribbons.Machines of such a type are for instance described in
the patent FR-A-1538604.The outer surface of the second flat cardboard ribbon of
the product obtained from such machines, consisting in a
corrugated cardboard with a single flat surface, reveals
the junction lines of the crests with the mentioned
second ribbon, usually known as "pressure lines". The presence of these lines is a source of both
technical and esthetic drawbacks. They decrease the
esthetic attractiveness of the product and may further
denote that the mechanical pressing action exerted on
the cardboard in order to glue the product has
determined a certain yielding of its cellulose fibers,
thus affecting the cardboard's mechanical properties.In order to overcome this drawback, the patent
application FR-A-2719521 offers a machine in which the
pressure directly exerted on the cardboard by the
pressing cylinder is reduced (and eventually annulled),
while on the contrary applying a stretching force,
through the second corrugating cylinder, on the second
flat cardboard ribbon, while both of the cardboard
ribbons are still running on the same.This kind of operation is not easily managed, as the
second flat cardboard ribbon is still substantially
applied to the first corrugated cardboard ribbon under
pressure, while the latter is still running on the
second corrugating roller and the glue has still not
taken hold.This application won't totally exclude that on the
second flat cardboard ribbon of the product obtained
from such machines some pressure lines may still appear,
especially when the operating production parameters need
to be changed. The most important prior art reference is constituted by

<CLAIMS>
A device (1) for the production of corrugated
cardboard (11) with a single flat surface, comprising a

first corrugating cylinder (2) and a second corrugating
cylinder (3), a heating cylinder (4), at least one

introducing cylinder (5, 6) for the first corrugated
cardboard ribbon (7), at least one introducing cylinder

(8) for a second cardboard ribbon (9) and at least one
extracting cylinder (10) for the corrugated cardboard

produced with a single flat surface (11), all said
cylinders (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10) being supported by a frame

(12) and being capable of rotating around their
respective axes all arranged parallel to each other,

where the heating cylinder (4) is arranged tangentially
to the second corrugating cylinder (3), the introducing

cylinder (8) for the second flat cardboard ribbon is
positioned above the gluing cylinder (22), and the

extracting cylinder (10) for the produced corrugated
cardboard (11) with a single flat surface is arranged on

the side of the heating cylinder (4) that is
opposite the side on which the first point of contact

(20) occurs,

characterised in that
 the
point (20) where the first contact occurs between the 

first corrugated cardboard ribbon (7) and the second
cardboard ribbon (9) lies on the lateral surface of the

heating cylinder (4) without the first corrugated cardboard ribbon (7) being subjected to any
significant force.
A device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the heating cylinder (4), the first corrugating cylinder
(2) and the second corrugating cylinder (3) are arranged

with their rotating axes (13-15) in the same plane.
A process for the production of corrugated cardboard
(11) with a single flat surface comprising the phases of:


introducing a first cardboard ribbon (7) between a pair
of corrugating cylinders (2, 3) fitted with projections

engaging each other, so as to corrugate said first
cardboard ribbon (7);
applying glue on the crests of the corrugations of said
first corrugated cardboard ribbon (7);
applying a second flat ribbon (9) on the tops of the
corrugations of the first ribbon (7), so as to form a

corrugated cardboard (11) with a single flat surface;
heating and activating the glue, said gluing so
occurring during the residence on the heating cylinder

(4);
characterised in that
 the application of the second
flat ribbon (9) on the crests of the first cardboard

ribbon (7) is carried out without a significant pressure
between the ribbons,
in that
 the first point of contact (20) between the first
already corrugated cardboard ribbon (7) and the second

flat cardboard ribbon (9) is set where the first
corrugated cardboard ribbon (7) is transferred, without

being subjected to any significant force, from the second
corrugating cylinder (3) to the heating cylinder (4), 

and 
in that
 the first contact between the ribbons occurs
with the second cardboard ribbon (9) kept stretched on

the cylinder (4), while the opposite crests of said first
corrugated cardboard ribbon (7) are unsupported.
