<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a primer
composition for use with urethane resins and for
adhering or bonding urethane resins to a variety of
substrates including silicone rubbers.Urethane resins are widely used in paints,
coatings, and sealants because they exhibit excellent
curability, elasticity, and wear resistance. A
disadvantage of urethane resins is their poor adhesion
to substrates and materials such as metals, plastics,
and organic and silicone rubbers. As a result, when it
is required to adhere urethane resins to a substrate of
material, the surface is generally first treated with
an undercoating agent referred to as a primer.Primer compositions proposed for use with
urethane resins include as the adhesion promoting
ingredient a silane coupling agent containing an amino,
epoxy, or isocyanate group. A disadvantage of primer
compositions containing these silanes is their tendency
to deteriorate during storage and loss of their
adhesion, making them unsuitable for their intended
use. In the particular case of silicone rubber
substrates, these primer compositions also exhibit
unsatisfactory adhesion, a disadvantage that has yet to
be overcome.The prior art for such primer compositions is
represented by Japanese Patent Publication [Kokai]
52/065529; United States Patent 4,727,168; and Japanese
Patent Publication [Kokai] 75/035092.The present invention resulted from extensive
research directed at eliminating the problem of reduced
adhesion following storage of primer compositions. An
objective of this invention is to provide a primer
composition for urethane resins that is able to firmly 
adhere or bond urethane resins to a variety of
substrates.Our primer composition comprises a solvent
and either an organosilane corresponding to the general
formula I
I   (R1O)xR2 3-xSiR3(XR4)yCOOH
or a partial hydrolysis/condensation product of said
organosilane, wherein R1 is an alkyl or alkoxyalkyl
radical; R2 is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical; R3 is
an alkylene radical; X is O, S, or NH; R4 is an
alkylene radical; x is 2 or 3; and y is 0 or 1.The organosilane used in the present
composition contains both a carboxyl group and silicon-bonded
alkoxy groups. The alkyl radicals represented
by R1 in formula I include methyl, ethyl and propyl.
The alkoxyalkyl radicals represented by R1 include
ethoxymethyl, methoxyethyl, and methoxypropyl.R2 in formula I represents a monovalent
hydrocarbon radical that includes methyl, ethyl, and
propyl. R3 and R4 are identical or different alkylene
radicals that include methylene,
