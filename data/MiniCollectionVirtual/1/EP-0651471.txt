<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) of the type having an 
array of signal contacts surface mountable to pads of 

a circuit board (20), with at least one ground bus (40) 
having a row of post sections (4
4,50,52) insertable 
into through holes (34) of the circuit board. At least 

two of the post sections (50,52) include protuberances 
(54,56) proximate free ends thereof adapted to bear 

against side walls of the respective through holes (34) upon 
insertion thereinto, for deflection of the shanks (62,64) 

of the post sections (50,52) in the opposite direction. The 
protuberances (54,56) of the at least two post sections (50,52) extend in 

opposed directions along the row of post sections (44,50,52), thus 
cooperating to act as a clamp of modest force to retain 

the connector (10) to the board (20) prior to contact soldering. The 
deflectable shank (62,64) preferably has a reduced cross-sectional 

area at root (66,68) facilitating deflection in 
the plastic region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electrical connector
which is mounted on a printed circuit board, and more
particularly to one which has a grounding bus which allows
for close centerline spacing of the terminals.There are currently numerous electrical connectors
commercially available which are mounted to a printed
circuit board. As the size of the machines in which the
printed circuit boards are installed decreases, the
density of the connectors positioned on the board must
increase. Also, as the machines become more
sophisticated, the complexity of the printed circuit
boards and the connectors must increase. Consequently,
the configuration of the machines requires that electrical
connectors with numerous terminals extending therefrom be
mounted on a printed circuit board in such a manner so as
to occupy a minimal area of board real estate.In order for the connectors to occupy a minimal
amount of board real estate, it has become extremely
desirable for connectors to have closely spaced terminals.
To accomplish the required spacing, all dimensions of the
connector must be minimized. However, the performance of
the connector cannot be compromised due to the close
centerline spacing of the terminals. It is therefore
essential that the electrical characteristics of the
connector not diminish as the size of the connector is
reduced.Consequently, in order to reduce the size of the
connector while maintaining the electrical performance
thereof, the present invention is directed to an enhanced
ground bus. The ground bus requires minimal space, but
provides the electrical characteristics to properly shield
the closely spaced terminals of the connector. Such an
enhanced ground bus is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
5,120,232, wherein matable ground bus bars are disposed in
respective ones of matable plug and receptacle connectors. 
The matable section of a first one of the bus bars
comprises staggered first and second mating portions along
the connector length, with the first and second mating
portions offset transversely, all in serpentine fashion;
the matable section of the second bus bar comprises spaced
first and second portions which are an array of spaced
arms offset transversely which are deflected by the
corresponding offset portions of the first bus bar and
remain spring biased thereagainst after mating for an
assured electrical connection therewith, in an interwoven
arrangement. Additional mating arms of the first bus bar
cooperate with the walls of the bus bar receiving recess
of the connector housing to

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (10,400,502) for a circuit board
(20,404,506) comprising a dielectric housing (12), electrical contacts (22)

for termination to the circuit board (20,404,506) secured in the housing
(12), an elongate conductive member (40,408,500) secured in the

housing and having a plurality of posts (44,50,52,100,200,300,412,414,
416,508,510) extending from a body section (42) of the conductive

member for insertion into through holes (34,448,504) in the circuit board,
and protuberances (54,56,102,302,430,432,518,524) on the posts for

engaging walls of the holes to hold the connector to the circuit board,
characterised in that at least two of the posts (50,52,100,200,300,412,

414, 416,508,510) are spaced apart so as to enter respective through
holes of the circuit board, said protuberances of said at least two posts

projecting from deflectable beam sections (62,64) thereof laterally of the
beam sections and in opposite directions therefrom, whereby said at least

two posts are associated in a pair with the protuberances thereof
engageable with opposite side walls of their respective holes and the

spring bias of the deflection of said pair of posts in opposite directions,
when inserted in their respective holes, holds the connector to the circuit

board prior to soldering, and said beam sections are joined to the body
section (42) via roots (66,68,442,444,526,528) of reduced cross-section

facilitating deflection of the posts.
The connector of claim 1, wherein
the posts have base sections

(48,106,208,306,418,420,422,512) adjacent the body section (42), and
the dielectric housing includes passageways (32,446,514) for receiving

said base sections with an interference fit. 
The connector of claim 2, wherein the beam section (62,64) of
each post is offset to one side of the centreline bisecting the base section

of the post so that the tip of its protuberance is closer to the centreline
than it would otherwise be if the beam section was not offset.
The connector of claim 2 or 3, wherein the beam sections (62,64)
are tapered from the protuberance (54,56) to said base sections (48) to

define the roots (66,68,442,444) of reduced cross-section.
The connector of claim 2 or 3, wherein notches (206) are disposed
between the base sections (208) and the beam sections to define the

roots of reduced cross-section.

has a body section and base sections (512), each of said base sections

includes two of said posts (508,510) to be received into one through hole

(44,50,53) are dimensioned to extend beyond a bottom face of the circuit

board (20) when the connector is fully seated.
The connector of any preceding claim 1 to 6, wherein the posts
