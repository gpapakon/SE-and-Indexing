<ABSTRACT>
A symmetric, dispersion-managed fiber optic
cable in accordance with the present invention includes a

first (230) and a second (240) optical fiber. The first optical
fiber (230) is a conventional single mode fiber (SMF) type fiber and

has a first effective area and a positive dispersion
characteristic at a predetermined operating wavelength

range. The first optical fiber (230) is split into two segments
each having substantially the same length. The second

optical fiber (240) has a second effective area and a negative
dispersion characteristic at the operating wavelength

range. Typically, second optical fiber (240) is a DSF or an NZD
fiber, both with negative dispersion and a small effective

area. The second optical fiber (240) is coupled between the two
segments of the first fiber (230) to create a fiber optic cable

with an average total dispersion at the operating
wavelength range which is substantially zero. The fiber

optic cable (250) may be incorporated into an optical fiber
transmission system with an optical terminal and at least

one repeater (120).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a fiber
optic cable and, more particularly, to a symmetric,
dispersion-managed fiber optic cable and system.Lightwave signals transmitted through optical
fibers are subject to various distorting and attenuating
non-linear effects that limit their practical transmission
distance. Typically, optical fibers are employed in fiber
optic systems that consists of an optical terminal and a
plurality of amplifiers/repeaters connected by optical
fibers. Amplifier/repeaters, which are typically situated
at regular intervals along a transmission path, serve to
boost the strength of the signal pulses, thereby
overcoming the effects of attenuation. The total length
of the transmission path is limited by phase shifts in the
pulsed signals resulting from the optical nonlinearity of
the optical fibers.The magnitude of the nonlinear effects on signal
transmission is affected by various characteristics of the
optical fibers. One such characteristic is the "effective
cross-sectional area" or simply "effective area" of a
fiber. For an optical signal of a given power density,
the larger the effective area, the further the signal can
be propagated through the fiber without substantial loss.
Thus, use of a fiber having a large effective area makes 
possible a lengthening of the span of optical fiber
between amplifier/repeaters and of the total transmission
system as well.Another important characteristic of an optical
fiber that affects signal transmission is its dispersion.
Nonlinear effects that are especially sensitive to fiber
dispersion include parametric processes such as self-phase
modulation, cross-phase modulation, and four-photon
mixing. Fiber dispersion causes frequency spreading of
the pulsed signal along the transmission path, an effect
that is cumulative and requires filtration of the signal
before its entrance into a receiver. Even with
filtration, the broadening of the received signal worsens
the signal-to-noise ratio and leads to increased signal
errors. It is thus desirable to have a dispersion
characteristic near zero at the operating wavelength range
of the optical transmission system. One convenient range
of operating wavelengths for long-range transmission
systems is between 1530 nm and 1560 nm.Certain commercially available optical fibers,
known as dispersion-shifted fibers (DSF), exhibit zero-dispersion
behavior near certain convenient operating
wavelengths, for example, near 1550 nm. However, these
fibers typically have small effective areas, requiring the
placement
