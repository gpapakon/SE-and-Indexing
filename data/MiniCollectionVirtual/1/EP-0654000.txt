<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a paperboard blank (10) having a top panel (11) provided with circular apertures (12), each having a diameter just less than the maximum diameter of a can rim. The rim can be pushed through the aperture (12) to retain the can relative to the blank (10). Side walls (14, 15, 16, 17) fold down the sides of the cans and are held by gluing panels (22, 24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to arrangements for 
holding a plurality of cans. Multipacks of cans are well known for drinks 
and foodstuffs. Cans of drinks, and indeed some 
foods, are often sold in multipacks utilising a 
plastic ring having a number of apertures for 
receiving a corresponding number of cans. This number 
is often four or six. It is, however, desirable to 
cease using plastic in such multipacks. EP-A-346693 discloses in combination, a 
paperboard member and a plurality of articles each of 
which has a top rim, said paperboard member having a 
plurality of apertures, wherein each top rim and each 
associated aperture are pushed relative to each other 
so that the rim passes through the aperture. The present invention is characterised in that 
the articles are cans and in that each aperture has a 
substantially continuous, unbroken periphery which has a shape corresponding 
to this of the associated top rim and which is 
dimensioned so as to be marginally smaller than the 
widest dimensions of the top rim of the can and 
which engages in unbroken fashion below the rim to 
prevent withdrawal of the can. Preferably the apertures have their marginal 
portion upturned prior to coupling with the can. This 
upturning may be a process performed by the packing 
machinery itself or the process may be performed when 
the packing blank is originally stamped. In preferred arrangements the paperboard 
member has side walls provided around the apertures 
which side walls are attached to the paperboard member 
along fold lines whereby in use the side walls are 
folded down so as to engage the cans and are secured 
in the folded down positions. This results in space 
for printing. The side walls may be secured with glue 
or by interlocking formations formed integrally with 
the side walls. This securing may take place before 
or after attachment to the cans.  
 In most situations the apertures are 
substantially circular. Conveniently the apertures 
are formed in generally rectangular arrays such as 
2 X 2 or 2 X 3 or 2 X 4 or even 1 X 2, 1 X 3, 1 X 4 or 
any other suitable configurations. Also finger 
gripping holes may be provided in the central space 
between each set of four apertures. In another arrangement two oppositely 
extending side walls are hingedly attached to the 
paperboard member, the side walls being adapted to 
fold over the tops of the cans and secured to each 
other with, for example, glue. Embodiments of the invention will now be 
described in more detail. The description makes

<CLAIMS>
In combination, a paperboard member and a 
plurality of articles (35) each of which has a top rim 

(36), said paperboard member having a plurality of 
apertures (12), wherein each top rim and each 

associated aperture are pushed relative to each other 
so that the rim passes through the aperture 

characterised in that the articles are cans and in 
that each aperture has a substantially continuous, 

unbroken periphery which has a shape corresponding to this of the associated 
top rim and which is dimensioned so as to be 

marginally smaller than the widest dimensions of the 
top rim (36) of the can and which engages in unbroken 

fashion below the rim to prevent withdrawal of the 
can. 
A combination as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the apertures (12) have their marginal portion (31) 

upturned prior to coupling with the can (35). 
A combination as claimed in claim 1 or claim 
2, wherein the paperboard member has side walls 

provided around the apertures (12) which side walls 
(14-17) are attached to the paperboard member along 

fold lines (18-21) whereby in use the side walls are 
folded down so as to engage the cans and are secured 

in the folded down position. 
A combination as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the side walls (14-17) are secured with glue. 
A combination as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the side walls (14-17) are secured by interlocking 

formations formed integrally with the side walls. 
A combination as claimed in claim 1 or claim 
2, wherein two oppositely extending side walls 

(41,42,45,47) are hingedly attached to the paperboard 
member, the side walls being adapted to fold over the 

tops of the cans and secured to each other.  
 
A combination as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 6, wherein the apertures (12) are substantially 

circular. 
A combination as claimed in any one of claims 
1 to 7, wherein finger gripping holes (13) are 

provided in the paperboard member.
