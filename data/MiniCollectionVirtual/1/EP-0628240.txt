<ABSTRACT>
A hay-making machine (1) for tedding mown crop, has 
a frame in which a plurality of rake members (18, 19, 20), 

which in a first working position are arranged in a row, are 
drivably disposed about an upwardly directed rotary shaft. 

The frame includes a pivotal construction having a pivot 
shaft (15) which predominantly extends in the direction of 

operative travel for pivoting an outermost frame portion (17) 
equipped with at least one rake member (20) upwardly to a 

transport position with respect to the further frame portion 
13, 16). The machine (1) has a second working position in 

which the outermost frame portion (17) is pivoted such 
through an angle of less than 90° about an upwardly directed 

pivot shaft (32, 48), also forming part of the pivotal 
construction, with respect to the further frame portion (13, 

16) that, relative to the direction of operative travel, it 
extends in the rearward direction. In the second working 

position, the machine (1) is suitable for tedding crop lying 
e.g. along ditches, without this crop being thrown thereinto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hay-making
machine according to the preamble of claim 1.A machine of this kind is known from
DE-U-85 35 012. In this Gebrauchsmuster a hay-making machine
is described having four rake members. The outermost rake
members can be pivoted about the upwardly extending pivot
shaft in a forward direction through a small angle in order
to obtain a better tedding action, and in a rearward direction to a transport position.From the US-A 4,026,093 a hay-making machine having
four rake members is known. The outermost rake member can be
pivoted about un upwardly extending pivot shaft in a rearward
direction as to obtain a transport position.The hay-making machines of these types may have
four, six or eight rake members which are driven alternately
in opposite directions of rotation. The tedded crop is spread
laterally to a considerable extent behind the hay-making
machine. Spreading the crop in this way is effected through a
width larger than that of the machine, which means that, when
the machine is driven along a ditch, the rake members throw
crop into same. The invention has for its object to obviate,
or at least mitigate this disadvantage to a considerable
extent.According to the invention, the above-described
hay-making machine is characterized in that the centre line
of said upwardly extending pivot shaft forms, in a vertical
plane in the direction of operative travel, an angle with the
centre line of the rotary shaft of a rake member, the machine
having a second working position in which the outermost frame
portion is pivoted through an angle of less than 90°
about the upwardly directed shaft with respect to the further
frame portion such that, relative to the direction of operative
travel, it extends in the rearward direction. With this
construction it becomes possible for this/these outermost
rake member(s) to catch the laterally, outwardly thrown crop
and to prevent that it is flung into the ditch. To enable a practical embodiment of the hay-making
machine, the pivotal construction will be incorporated in its
totality within the peripheral circle described by the rake
member of that frame portion that is not pivotal in the
rearward direction, and directly borders on a rake member of
the frame portion which can be pivoted rearwardly.In a practical embodiment of the machine in accordance
with the invention, the centre line of the pivot shaft
predominantly extending in the direction of operative travel
will intersect that of the upwardly directed pivot shaft. The
