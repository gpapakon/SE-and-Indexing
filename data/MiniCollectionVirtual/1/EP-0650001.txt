<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a gear position indicator for the manual control of a motor-vehicle gearbox, in which a translucent display area (1) is provided with symbols to represent the gear chosen by the driver. The display area serves to accommodate light sources (3) in a partially covered manner underneath the cover (2) of the housing of the gear-change mechanism, the said light sources illuminating the entire display area continuously with diffuse light. A reflective component (4), for example a mirror, is used to illuminate the selected gear.

Gearshift-position indicator for the manual gearshift
mechanism of a gear-change box of a motor vehicle with:


a gearshift lever,
a housing,
a gate in the form of the gearshift channels,
an opaque covering (2) within which a permanently
diffusely-illuminated structural element (1) is arranged

which indicates the particular gearshift position, which is
translucent and at the same time light-conducting and which

has symbols for indicating the selected transmission gear,
whereby
a light-reflecting component (4) executes a movement
which is synchronous with the movement of the gearshift

lever and within the structural element (1) a symbol
corresponding to the selected transmission gear highlights

said selected transmission gear in intensely brightened
manner by reflection of light, characterised in that the

structural element (1) accommodates, in partially masked
manner below the covering (2) and for each gearshift

position, a separate incandescent lamp, glow-discharge lamp
or light-emitting diode (3), and in that the light-reflecting

component is a light-collecting concave mirror
(4).
