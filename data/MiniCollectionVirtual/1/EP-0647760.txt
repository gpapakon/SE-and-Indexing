<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a fixing means (1) having metal expansion bolts (2) and an expansion element (5), it being possible for the expansion element (5) to be anchored in a bore (13) which exhibits an undercut (12) by drawing it in and/or pushing it onto the expansion cone (3) of the expansion bolt (2). In order to permit secure anchorage in slabs made of glass or a similar material, an elastically and/or plastically deformable pressing element (8) consisting of soft plastic is arranged between the expansion element (5) and the wall of the undercut bore (13).

<CLAIMS>
Fastening element comprising an expander bolt and an expansible element each
consisting of metal, the expansible element being anchorable, in a drilled hole having an

undercut in a panel that consists in particular of glass or of a similar material, by
retracting and/or pushing it onto the expander cone of the expander bolt, 
characterized
in that
 the fastening element (1) comprises a resiliently and/or plastically deformable
compression element (8, 31) made of a soft plastics material, which compression

element is arranged between the expansible element (5, 23) and a wall of the undercut
of the drilled hole when the fastening element (1) has been anchored. 
Fastening element according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the compression element (8) is of
sleeve-shaped construction and is extended by

means of a spacer portion (10), on which there is
arranged a flange (14) that rests on the outer surface

of the panel (6).
Fastening element according to claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 the inner wall of the compression element
(8) is provided with recessed portions (20) that

receive the expansible element (5).
Fastening element according to claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 the compression element (8) has a plurality
of wall segments (11) that overlie the expansible

element (5).
Fastening element according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the expander bolt is in the form of a blind
rivet (22) and the expansible element is in the form

of a slit expansible sleeve (23), and the compression
element is a rubber ring (31) arranged on the

slit portion of the expansible sleeve (23).
