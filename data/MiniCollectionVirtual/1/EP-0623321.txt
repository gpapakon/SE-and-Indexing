<ABSTRACT>
This invention reports a femoral part for a hip 
joint prosthesis, intended for cementless fixation, 

which is made up of a shaft (2) comprising a narrow shaft 
core (12) and several longitudinal ribs (14) directed radially 

outward on the shaft core. In order to achieve better 
primary and long-term stability, the longitudinal ribs 

taper radially outward toward their edges and also 
taper longitudinally toward the distal end of the 

shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a femoral part of a hip joint 
prosthesis to be anchored without cement, having a shaft 
with a narrow core and several longitudinal ribs extending 
outward from the core. Such a femoral part is known, for example, from German 
Patent 28 39 092 A1, in which the shaft is straight and has 
several longitudinal ribs extending radially outward with 
constant thickness of the ribs, and which have self-cutting 
scraping teeth on the edges of the longitudinal ribs. 
Because of these properties this known femoral part can be 
driven into a prepared channel formed in the femur. In this 
case the channel has a diameter greater than that of the 
shaft core, dimensioned so that only the scraping teeth on 
the edges of the longitudinal ribs contact the bone, cutting 
out a groove for each longitudinal rib. The femoral 
prosthesis is surrounded by adjacent cancellous tissue only 
at the edges of the longitudinal ribs. The rest of the 
longitudinal ribs and the shaft core are free in the channel 
and are not supported by adjacent cancellous tissue. The 
primary stability of the femoral part, at least - that is, 
the stability of the femoral part immediately after its 
implantation - is not satisfactory for this known hip 
prosthesis. From US-A-3064 645 which discloses the features of the preamble 
of claim 1, there is also known a femoral part of a hip implant 
having a shaft with a narrow shaft core and ribs extending 
radially out of the shaft core, the ribs tapering radially toward 
their edges and longitudinally toward the distal shaft end. The objective of this invention, therefore, is to develop a 
femoral part of the type initially mentioned which has 
adequate primary and long-term stability following 
implantation, with minimum removal of bone tissue.  
 This objective is achieved for the femoral part 
of the type initially mentioned with the features of the 
characterizing part of claim 1. The 
longitudinal ribs are directed radially outward from 
the shaft core and are tapered both toward the outside 
and toward the distal end of the shaft. In this way, with the longitudinal ribs directed 
radially outward in the form of a star, tapering both 
toward the outside and toward the distal end of the 
shaft, it is possible, with a sufficiently narrow 
shaft core, to drive the femoral part directly into 
the cancellous tissue of the femoral bone, with the 
part cutting its own channel, so that no socket 
channel need be previously formed in the cancellous 
tissue. When the femoral part is
