<ABSTRACT>
A process for the continuous production of cannelloni which comprises 

a. forming a blanched, pasta strand (11), 
b. cutting the blanched, pasta strand longitudinally into a 
plurality of strips (13,14) lying side by side, 
c. preforming the strips into curved strips by training the strips 
around preforming devices (16) shaped to cause the longitudinal edges of 

the strips to pass out of the plane of the longitudinal axis of the 
strips, 
d. passing the curved strips with their concave surfaces facing 
upwards onto a cannelloni-forming conveyor belt (18), 
e. transporting the curved strips downstream on the 
cannelloni-forming conveyor belt (18) and depositing a filling (23) onto

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
continuous production of cannelloni. Cannelloni is traditionally made manually in separate 
steps. However, not only is the pasta usually very sticky 
and slippery to handle, the process is extremely time and 
labour consuming. FR-A-440 700 describes a method apparatus for making cannelloni 
by forming a stripe of pasta into a tube by means of complexed 
shaped pulleys.  
 We have now deviced an automatic mechanical process which 
obviates the above disadvantages. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for 
the continuous production of cannelloni 
from curved stripes into which a filling is deposited while simultaneously 
the curved strips are formed into closed tubes having an overlapping seam, said process 
is characterised in that it comprises the steps of 
a. forming a blanched, pasta strand, b. cutting the blanched, pasta strand longitudinally into a 
plurality of strips lying side by side, c. preforming the strips into curved strips by training the 
strips around a plurality of preforming devices, each of which is 
a convex shaped roller having two opposite sides whose diameter 
increases to a maximum at approximately mid point between the 
two sides of the roller to cause the  
 
longitudinal edges of the strips to pass out of the plane 
of the longitudinal axis of the strips.  d. passing the curved strips with their concave surfaces 
facing upwards onto a cannelloni-forming conveyor belt,  e. transporting the curved strips downstream on the 
cannelloni-forming conveyor belt and depositing a filling 
onto the curved strips simultaneously while forming the 
curved strips into closed tubes each having an overlap 
seam.   The blanched, pasta strand may be formed by any 
conventional method, e.g. where the pasta dough is extruded 
from a kneader/sheeter to give a strand which is passed 
onto a conveyor belt which transports the strand through a 
blanching tank containing hot water and then out of the 
blanching tank onto a cooling conveyor. Advantageously, the blanched, pasta strand is transported 
on a conveyor belt, which may conveniently be a cooling 
conveyor belt, above which are positioned at least one 
cutting devices e.g. rotating circular knives, adapted to 
cut the pasta strand longitudinally into a plurality of 
strips lying side by side. The maximum number of strips is 
unlimited depending upon the diameter of the cannelloni and 
the available width of pasta strand before cutting. 
However, the usual number of strips in 4,

A process for the continuous production of cannelloni 
from curved strips (17) into which a filling (23) is deposited 

while simultaneously the curved strips (17) are formed into 
closed tubes (25) having overlapping seams (26), said pr

each of which is a convex shaped roller (16) having two opposite 
sides whose diameter increases to a maximum at approximately 

mid point between the two sides of the roller (16) to cause the
