<ABSTRACT>
An airport incursion avoidance sy stem for detection of 
aircraft and other vehicles utilizes edge lights [20]
 
along taxiways and runways by having a sensor [50]
 co-located 
with each edge light, the sensor output being 

coupled to a central computer system [12] via the 

airport's edge light power lines [21]. The detection 

system comprises infrared sensors. The output of each 
sensor [50]
 is fed into a microprocessor [44] within an 

edge light assembly [20] and then to a power line modem 

[54] for transmission to the central computer system [12]
 
which includes a display [30]
 at the airport tower for 
showing the airport and all traffic thereon. Data from 

each sensor [50] along taxiways and runways is received at 

the central computer system [12] and processed to provide 

vehicle tracking and control of all ground traffic on the 
airport taxiways and runways to avoid an airport 

incursion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an airport ground collision 
avoidance system and in particular to an apparatus and 
method for monitoring, controlling and predicting aircraft 
or other vehicle movement primarily on airport taxiways and 
runways to avoid runway incursions. Currently, ground control of aircraft at an airport is 
done visually by the air traffic controller in the tower. 
Low visibility conditions sometimes make it impossible for 
the controller to see all parts of the field. Ground 
surface radar can help in providing coverage during low 
visibility conditions; it plays an important part in the 
solution of the runway incursion problem but cannot solve 
the entire problem. A runway incursion is defined as "any 
occurrence at an airport involving an aircraft, vehicle, 
person, or object on the ground that creates a collision 
hazard or results in loss of separation with an aircraft 
taking off, intending to take off, landing, or intending to 
land." The U.S. Federal Administration Agency (FAA) has 
estimated that it can only justify the cost of ground 
surface radar at 29 of the top 100 airports in the United 
States. However, such radar only provides location 
information; it cannot alert the controller to possible 
conflicts between aircraft.  In the prior art, an airport control and monitoring 
system has been used to sense when an airplane reaches a 
certain point on a taxiway and controls switching lights on 
and off to indicate to the pilot when he may proceed on to a 
runway. Such a system sends microwave sensor information to 
a computer in the control tower. The computer comprises 
software for controlling the airport lighting and for 
providing fault information on the airport lighting via 
displays or a control panel to an operator. Such a system 
is described in sales information provided on a Bidirectional 
Series 7 Transceiver (BRITEE) produced by ADB-ALNACO, 
Inc., A Siemens Company, of Columbus, Ohio. 
However, such a system does not show the location of all 
vehicles on an airfield and is not able to detect and avoid 
a possible vehicle incursion. A well known approach to airport surface traffic 
control has been the use of scanning radars operating at 
high frequencies such as K-band in order to obtain adequate 
definition and resolution. An existing airport ground 
traffic control equipment of that type is known in the art 
as Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE). However, 
such equipment provides surveillance only, no discrete 
identification of aircraft on the surface
