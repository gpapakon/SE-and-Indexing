<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a flat multi-conductor wire which includes a plurality of 
flat wires (23) arranged in planar, predetermined spaced relation and each having 

a rectangular conductor (21), and conductor coupling tapes (26) and coating 
coupling tapes (27) for coupling together the flat wires (23) in contact portions (25) 

at their opposed ends, whereby the flat multi-conductor wire is thin and flexible, 
requires no high temperature treatment on the contact portions at the ends, and is 

permitted for use in small-space wiring and two-dimensional flexural wiring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to flat multi-conductor wires for use in wiring 
of office automation equipments, vehicle-mounted electronics and the like. Conventionally, this type of flat multi-conductor wire includes those shown 
in Figs. 6A, 6B, 7A, 7B, for example. Figs. 6A and 6B illustrate a flat multi-conductor 
wire known generally as a FPC (flexible printed wiring board) and a FFC 
(flat flexible wiring board), which comprises a plurality of elongated rectangular 
conductors 1 in the form of a thin plate or a foil arranged in predetermined spaced 
relation, and tapes 2a, 2b bonded to top and bottom surfaces of the rectangular 
conductors 1 in a sandwiched manner throughout the length thereof. The tape 2a 
on the top surface is removed at opposite ends to expose the rectangular conductors 
1. The exposed portions of the rectangular conductors 1 are forced into a connector 
not shown to contact an internal terminal of the connector for electrical connection 
thereto. The flat multi-conductor wire shown in Figs. 7A, 7B is disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 3-236112 (1991) proposed by the applicant of 
the present invention which comprises a plurality of round wires 7 juxtaposed in 
planar, predetermined spaced relation and each including a round conductor 5 and 
an insulative coating 6 thereon. The coatings 6 are peeled off at opposite ends of  
 
the round wires 7 to expose the round conductors 5 to form contact portions 8. A 
fixing tape 9 provided on the back of the contact portions 8 adheres to the exposed 
round conductors 5 and the coatings 6 adjacent the contact portions 8. A coupling 
tape 10 provided on the front of the coatings 6 adjacent the contact portions 8 
adheres to the coatings 6. In the structure of Figs. 7A and 7B, only an adhesive does not provide 
sufficient adherence between the conductors 5 and the fixing tape 9 because of the 
round shape of the conductors 5. It is, hence, a common practice to coat the entire 
round conductors 5 with tin which is in turn melted at a high temperature of about 
350 °C to bond the fixing tape 9 to the round conductors 5 in the contact portions 
8 by penetration of tin into the fixing tape 9. In the flat multi-conductor wire such as the FPC, FFC shown in Figs. 6A and 
6B, however, since the rectangular configuration of the conductors themselves 
provides a high flexural rigidity in the lateral directions, the conductors 1 are 
difficult to bend when the exposed portions of the conductors 1 at their one end are 
inserted
