<ABSTRACT>
Device for use in a rearing unit in the sea, of the kind where a floating ring (9) supports a net bag (2) at a certain distance from the surface. Means (6, 7, 16) are provided for regulating the distance between the sea surface and the location of the rearing unit. The device comprises a frame (4) and a top net (3) which has a shape that is adapted to the floating ring (9). The top net (3) is sewn to the jumping fence of the rearing unit so that with the net bag (2) it forms a closed unit, from which unit the fish can not escape. The distance-regulating means (6, 7, 16) is provided for lowering the net bag (2) with the top net (3) when an external environmental effect is threatening the fish in the rearing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fish rearing units, 
particulary a device according to the introductory part of 
patent claim 1, known from SE-B-459139. Rearing fish in rearing units located in the ocean can 
be subject to undesirable changes in the environment, such 
as the flourishing of algae or jellyfish, and oil spillage. 
These occurances have shown to be an expensive problem for 
the rearing trade. So far fish farmers have in such cases 
had two options for preserving the value of the fish in the 
rearing plant: 
1) slaughtering of the fish stock,  2) relocating the plant in a different area.   Both theses methods have been unsatisfactory for the 
fish farmer due to the large economic losses incurred. On 
the market today, there are closed PVC-rearing units where 
the water is pumped up from deeper layers. These units 
utilize the principle of transporting clean water up to the 
fish, and keep it separated from the environment, using a 
unit with a closed PVC-cloth. There are also other known solutions where the rearing 
unit is lowered, with the floating ring/cage using 
air-filled, closed rooms in the floating ring. This is 
stated in NO patent publication 150.741, GB patent 
publication 2.008.912, DE patent publication 2.713.268, SE 
patent publication 458.088. Common to all these publications 
are the feature that both the rearing unit and floating ring 
should be lowered. The fish farmers thus cannot use existing 
investments in traditional rearing plants. In order to hinder the spread of oil spillage, there 
exists oil bilges which suck up the oil, however, this is 
too expensive to have on each plant. The oil bilge does not 
suck up all surface oil. There will thus always be a thin 
film left on the sea surface, and this film is pollutive for 
fish jumping at the surface. Furthermore, the effect of the 
oil bilge will be less if there are waves higher than 2-3 m.  
 There is a need for a device which can be a part of 
each rearing plant's preparedness for restricting losses due 
to flourishing of algae/jellyfish or oil spillage. This 
equipment demands two person per rearing unit for 
assembling. The assembly can be done in 1-2 hours. This 
lowerable rearing unit equipment, in addition to the 
monitoring system which is located to monitor the 
flourishing of algae and oil spillage, may be saving a lot 
of plants from great losses due to damage from flourishing 
algae/jellyfish or oil spillage. So far, it has only been 
possible to alert fish farmers to the flourishing algae, 
without the

<CLAIMS>
Device for use in a rearing unit in the sea, of the kind where a floating ring (9) 
supports a net bag (2) at a certain distance from the surface, and where means (6, 7, 

16) are provided for regulating the distance between the sea surface and the location 
of the rearing unit, comprising a frame (4) provided 

for holding the net bag (2) stretched when the net bag is in a lowered position and a 
top net (3) 
characterized
 by the top net (3) 
which has a shape that is adapted to the floating ring (9), which top net 

(3) is sewen to the jumping fence of the rearing unit so that with the net bag (2) it 
forms a closed unit separatable from the floating ring (9), from which unit the fish 

can not escape, wherein the distance-regulating means (6, 7, 16) is provided for 
lowering the net bag (2) with the top net (3), leaving the floating ring (9) on the sea 

surface. 
Device according to claim 1,
characterized
 by the distance-regulating means (6, 7, 16) comprises a 
plurality of ropes (6) is fastened to the net bag (2), said ropes (6) extending through 

upper blocks (7), fastened to a banister (8) on the floating ring (9). 
Device according to claim 1-2,
characterized
 by the ropes (6) being fastened to the net bag (2) through 
lower blocks (16). 
Device according to claim 1-3, 
characterized
 by the ropes (6) being 
connected to a windlass, winch, power block or similar device (11). 
Device according to claim 1-4,
characterized
 in that there are between four and twelve, preferably eight 
upper blocks (7), ropes (6), and lower blocks (16). 
Device according to claim 1-5,
characterized
 by the lower blocks (16) being connected to the net bag (2) 
through a safety hook (17) and/or carrier noose (18). 
Device according to claim 1-6,
characterized
 by the frame (4) has the shape of a ring, quadrant or 
octagon, and is made from plastics, metal or wood.  

 
Device according to claim 7,
characterized
 by the frame (4) comprising plastic tubes (25) which are 
connected using angle link (26, 27), T- link (28) and/or cross link (29), or being 

welded to form one unit. 
Device according to claim 7,
characterized
 by the frame (4) comprising a band (23) of plastics or 
metal, which is preferably formed from lengths connected using bolts and nuts (24). 
Device according to claim 7, 
characterized
 by a floating body (13) 
provided near the centre of the top net (3).
