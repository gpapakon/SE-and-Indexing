<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixing and shut-off valve with a handle (6) that can be moved with one degree of freedom and a valve housing (2) which has inlet and outlet openings, in which a valve-seat disc (4) is held in a manner fixed in terms of relative rotation and on which a valve-regulating disc (3) which can be rotated by means of the handle is mounted in a sealing manner, the valve-seat disc having inlet and outlet apertures which are connected to the inlet and outlet openings (23, 24, 25) and which, on the other hand, can be brought into overlap with a cut-out in the valve-regulating disc. To improve this valve, the proposal is that the outlet aperture should be arranged in the central area and the inlet apertures in the peripheral area, on a circumcircle, in the valve-seat disc and that the cut-out in the valve-regulating disc should overlap the outlet aperture and should be provided with two radial extensions (311, 312) for connection to the associated inlet apertures, the first extension being dimensioned in such a way that, with the mixing valve closed, it is situated, with the necessary spacing, between the two inlet apertures and, given a leftward rotation, moves into increasing overlap with the inlet aperture for the cold medium, while the second extension is positioned in such a way that it moves increasingly into overlap with the inlet aperture for the hot medium only after the maximum opening of the aperture for the cold medium has been reached and with further leftward rotation, this movement being such that there is at the same time a corresponding decrease in the overlap of the first extension with the inlet aperture for the cold medium.

Mixing and shut-off valve, especially for the field of sanitary installations, having a
rotatable handgrip (6) and a valve housing which has one inlet hole (23, 24) each

for the cold and warm media and an outlet hole (25) and in which a valve seat
disc (4) is held non-rotatably, against which valve seat disc (4) there is sealingly

mounted a valve regulation disc (3) capable of being rotated by means of the
handgrip (6), the valve seat disc (4) having inlet through-holes (41, 42), which are

arranged on a concentric circle in its peripheral region and are in communication
with the inlet and outlet holes (23, 24, 25), and a central outlet through-hole (43),

which on the other face can be brought into an overlapping relationship with an
opening (31) in the valve regulation disc (3), which opening (31) overlies the outlet

through-hole (43), so that when the handgrip (6) is actuated, starting from the
shut-off position, only cold water is increasingly delivered at first, characterised in

that the inlet through-holes (41, 42) for the cold and warm media are arranged in
one half of the valve seat disc (4) and the opening (31) is formed in a knee shape

having two extensions (311, 312), which extend radially and form an obtuse
angle (313) with respect to one another, the first extension (311) being provided

for the cold medium and having dimensions such that it is located, when the
mixing valve is closed, between the two inlet through-holes (41, 42) at the distance

from the two inlet through-holes (41, 42) necessary for sealing off and, on rotation
to the left from the shut-off position, increasingly comes to overlie the inlet

through-hole (41) for the cold medium, while the second extension (312) is so
positioned that only when the first extension (311) has come to overlie the

associated inlet through-hole (41) to a maximum extent and rotation to the left is
continued does that extension (312) come increasingly to overlie the inlet through-hole

(42) for the warm medium in such a manner that there is simultaneously a
corresponding reduction in the extent to which the first extension (311) overlies the

inlet through-hole (41) for the cold medium. 
Mixing and shut-off valve according to claim 1, characterised in that the two
extensions (311, 312) are arranged at an angle (313) of approximately 130° with

respect to one another.
Mixing and shut-off valve according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the first
extension (311) has a narrowing (3110), and the inlet through-holes (41, 42) are

constructed as sectors of an annulus, the inner end face of which is, in each case,
defined by a radius (410, 420).
Mixing and shut-off valve according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the inlet through-holes (41, 42) are spaced 90° apart.
Mixing and shut-off valve according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the valve regulation disc (3) is held, non-rotatably and sealed, by a carrier

element (5); and the carrier element (5) is capable of being rotated by means of a
post (51), extends out of the valve housing through a bearing bore (21) and has

means for attaching the handgrip (6), with the carrier element (5) abutting a
shoulder (22) in the valve housing for support and axial retention of the valve

regulation disc (3) and the valve seat disc (4).
Mixing and shut-off valve according to claim 5, characterised in that the carrier
element (5) has in the post (51), coaxially with respect to the central axis (10), a

bore (52) having a displacement thread (53), in which bore (52) there is arranged,
sealed, a threaded stem (50) of a throttle valve for restricting the maximum

outflow, there being constructed on the threaded stem (50) a throttle valve
body (501), which cooperates with the outlet through-hole (43), which is

constructed as throttle valve seat.
Mixing and shut-off valve according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that stopping
lugs are constructed on the carrier element (5), which, together with corresponding

stops on the valve housing, limit the rotary movement of the valve regulating
disc (3) from the shut-off position to the outflow of the maximally warm medium. 
Mixing and shut-off valve according to claim 7, characterised in that there is
provided at least one stop that, in addition, can be released manually by the user

or is constructed as a catching point past which further rotation is possible.
Mixing and shut-off valve according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that the valve housing is constructed as a cartridge housing (2) accommodating

all the valve elements and corresponds approximately to the external dimensions
of a valve cartridge having a valve regulation disc that can be moved in two

degrees of freedom for adjustment of the mixing ratio and the amount of flow.
Mixing and shut-off valve according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that the angle of rotation of the handgrip (6) from the shut-off position to the fully

opened warm water position is 90°.
