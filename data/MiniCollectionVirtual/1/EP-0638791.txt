<ABSTRACT>
An improved torque sensor, or relative angular 
movement sensor, comprises an input member (5), an 

output member (2), LED light sources (20), a pair of 
photodetector units (28a,28b) adapted to receive light 

from the LED light sources, and signal processing 
means, in which said signal processing means is adapted 

to receive output signals from the photodetector units, 
the output signals of the photodetector units being 

dependent upon the light signals which they receive, 
and the signal processing means being adapted to 

process the output signals from the photodetector units 
so as to produce a modified output signal indicative of 

the relative angular displacement between, or torque 
applied between, the input and output member. The 

improvement comprises the provision of diagnostic means 
which continuously monitors a sum signal, Σ, which 

comprises the sum of the output signals from the 
photodetector units, and which detects any variation in 

the sum signal due to failure of the sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in optical
torque sensors especially, but not exclusively, for
incorporation in power-assisted steering systems for
vehicles.In EP-A-555 987
a torque sensor is described which comprises an input
member, an output member, emitter means, first receiver
means adapted to receive a first signal, second
receiver means adapted to receive a second signal, and
signal processing means, in which said signal
processing means is adapted to receive output signals
from the first and second receiver means, the output
signals of the receiver means being dependent upon the
first and second signals which they receive, and the
signal processing means being adapted to process the
output signals from the first and second receiver means
so as to produce a modified output signal indicative of
the relative angular displacement between, or torque
applied between, the input and output member. A torque
sensor of this type will hence forth be referred to as
a torque sensor of the kind described.A torque sensor of the kind described may be
incorporated in a power-assisted steering system having
an input column transmitting torque from a steering
wheel to the input member of the torque sensor, and an
output column transferring torque to a steering
mechanism adapted to steer road wheels of the system.
The modified output signal of the torque sensor may be
used to control the operation of an electric steering
motor adapted to steer the road wheels. A highly desirable feature of any torque sensor is
the facility for easy detection of partial or total
failure of the sensor. This is vitally important in a
safety critical application such as a vehicle steering
system. If the sensor can be tested each time the
system is switched on or off, or preferably
continuously during operation, this allows a
significant increase in the safety of the system, since
the driver can be warned of the fault and the system
returned to a safe state. An example of such a safe
state would be to disable the power assistance in the
steering system until the sensor has been replaced or
repaired.An aim of the present invention is to provide
diagnostic means capable of detecting partial or total
failure of a torque sensor of the kind described.According to a first aspect the invention
comprises a torque sensor having an input member, an
output member, emitter means, first receiver means
adapted to receive a first signal, second receiver
means adapted to receive a second signal, and signal
processing mean adapted to receive
