<ABSTRACT>
A food product having a crisp texture, golden 
brown appearance and fresh fired taste of 

conventionally-fried foods, comprising a food substrate 
coated with a cereal-based batter containing a 

non-gelling milk protein in which the batter has a 
solids level of at least 30 percent by weight and 

provides at least about 0.2 percent by weight of the 
non-gelling milk protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
Consumers develop preferences for particular types of food based
upon texture, ie the tactile experience caused caused by the food in their
mouths in conjunction with the food's distinct visual, physical and
chemical characteristics. For example, fried, battered and
battered/breaded foods are extremely popular because so many people
have developed a liking for the crisp texture, golden brown appearance,
and fresh fried taste of such foods.Unfortunately, once prepared, the crisp texture, golden brown
appearance, and fresh fried taste of conventionally fried foods are difficult
to maintain. This problem is particularly acute in situations such as those
encountered in fast food restaurants, where battered and battered/breaded
foods are fried up and then held for a period of time before they are
purchased and consumed. This problem is also of concern with respect to
frozen and refrigerated battered/breaded foods which are purchased by
consumers for final preparation in the home.Therefore, it would be highly desirable to develop fried battered
and battered/breaded foods which have the crisp texture, golden brown
appearance, and fresh fried taste of conventionally fried foods, yet can be
stored after preparation without losing these desirable organoleptic
properties.US patent No. 3 830 941 discloses a coating for popcorn, corn
chips and potato chips comprising an oil/water dispension including a
starch hydrolysate and a protein which is dried to form a glaze.European Patent Publication No. O 219 425 discloses two cookie
dough compositions used to form a cookie with a chewy centre and a
crunchy exterior. The dough is cereal based and includes casein. US Patent No. 3 323 922 discloses a coating to protect food from
air and moisture which comprises a film forming substance, a plasticiser
and a liquid which is immiscible in the plasticiser. The coating is applied
to the food and allowed to dry; no cooking is required.JP 5 3121948 discloses a liquid mixture comprising edible oil,
flour, water, an emulsifier, egg white and sodium casein for use in
preparing ready fried frozen tempura.International patent publication No. WO93/15619 relates to the
application of a film to a dry already breaded product.Batters and breadings in Food Processing pages 104,105,175,176,
and 234-236 discloses the effects on the different ingredients in batters
and breadings and discloses the feature of batters being applied at 30-50%
solids content.The present invention is directed to battered and battered/breaded
foods and to methods of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A parfried or fully cooked food product obtainable by a process
comprising:


producing a cereal-based hydrated batter containing dry
ingredients, added edible fat, water and a non-gelling milk protein,

wherein some or all of the edible fat is creamed onto some or all of the
dry ingredients before the dry ingredients are hydrated and wherein said

hydrated batter has a total solids level of at least about 30 percent by

weight;
coating the batter onto a food substrate, with the batter being
picked up on the substrate at a level sufficient to provide at least

about 0.2 percent by weight of the non-gelling milk protein based on the
weight of the coated product; and
at least parfrying the coated substrate to set the coating;
said non-gelling milk protein being a caseinate; wherein
gelling proteins are excluded from the hydrated batter.
The food product of claim 1 including a breading.
The food product of claim 2 in which the breading is coated onto
the batter as an overcoat.
The food product of claim 2 in which the breading is applied to the
food substrate as an undercoat.
The food product of claim 1 in which the food substrate is chosen
from the group consisting of meat, poultry, seafood, cheese, vegetables,

fruit, cereal-based products and nuts. 
The food product of claim 5 in which the cereal-based products
include pizza doughs, biscuit doughs, grain-based snacks, veggie burgers,

and breakfast cereals.
The food product of claim 1 including an undercoating or
overcoating of flour and breadings in which the dry ingredients comprise

about 15-76 percent by weight wheat flour, about 0-60 percent by weight
yellow corn flour, about 0-75 percent by weight modified and/or

unmodified food starch, about 0-15 percent by weight salt, about 0-20 percent by weight sugars and
about 0.25 percent by weight leavening.
The food product of claim 1 including an undercoating or an
overcoating of flour or breadings in which the dry ingredients comprise

about 0-20 percent by weight yellow corn flour, about 10-90 percent by
weight modified and/or unmodified food starch, about 0-20 percent by

weight wheat flour, about 2-10 percent by weight salt, about 0-5 percent

The food product of claim 1 in which the hydrated batter has a total
solids level of from about 30-60 percent by weight.
The food product of claim 1 in which the non-gelling milk protein
is chosen from the group consisting of sodium caseinate, calcium

caseinate, and potassium caseinate.
The food product of claim 1 in which the level of non-gelling milk
protein in the hydrated batter ranges from about 0.6 to 8.0 percent by

weight. 
The food product of claim 1 in which the pick-up of the hydrated
batter on the food substrate is sufficient to provide about 0.2 to 3.0

percent by weight of the non-gelling milk protein based on the weight of
the coated product.
The food product of claim 1 wherein at least 2 percent by weight of
edible fat is included in the hydrated cereal based batter based on the

weight of the batter.
A method of preparing a food product comprising:

coating a food substrate with a cereal based hydrated batter
containing added edible fat and a non-gelling milk protein being a

caseinate in which the hydrated batter has a total solids level of at least
about 30 percent by weight and provides at least about 0.2 percent by

weight of the non-gelling milk protein based on the weight of the coated

caseinate in which the hydrated batter has a total solids level of at least
about 30 percent by weight and provides at least about 0.2 percent by

weight of the non-gelling milk protein based on the weight of the coated
product;
