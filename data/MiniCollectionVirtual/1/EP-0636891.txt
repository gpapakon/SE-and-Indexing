<ABSTRACT>
In phase difference detecting method, circuit, and 
apparatus of the present invention, a voltage signal 

having a predetermined frequency is applied to a 
photoconductive light-receiving device (110), and an optical 

signal is received by this photoconductive 
light-receiving device. A current generated upon 

reception of light and flowing in the photoconductive 
light-receiving device reflects a product value of the 

voltage signal and the optical signal, and contains a DC 
component according to a phase difference between the 

voltage signal and the component of the optical signal 
having the same intensity modulation frequency as that of 

the voltage signal. A time average value of the current 
flowing in the photoconductive light-receiving device or 

a voltage value obtained upon conversion of this current 
is g
enerated, and only the DC component is extracted, 
thereby detecting the phase difference between the 

voltage signal and the component of the optical signal 
having the same intensity modulation frequency as that of 

the voltage signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method, circuit,
and apparatus for detecting a phase difference between an
optical signal and an electrical signal.A lot of PLL (Phase-Lock Loop) devices (phase
comparator) and DBMs (Double-Balanced Mixers), both of
which output a phase difference between two electrical
signals, are commercially available as component devices.
These component devices operate and output the phase
differences between the electrical signals. For this
reason, when a phase difference between a component of an
intensity-modulated light and an electrical signal is
measured, the optical signal must be converted into an
electrical signal to measure the phase difference.
Additionally, in these component devices, variations in
intensity of an input electrical signal accordingly cause
variations in phase difference output. Therefore, these
component devices substantially need to be used at a
constant input intensity.As a phase difference detecting apparatus, a lock-in
amplifier for outputting amplitude and phase difference 
information, a vector voltmeter mainly used in a high frequency region, or a
phase meter for outputting only a phase difference is known. These
apparatuses are constituted to obtain an accurate phase difference even when
the input intensity varies to some extent. In these apparatuses, however, when
a phase difference between a light intensity-modulated component and an
electrical signal is to be measured, the optical signal must be converted into
an electrical signal (in some cases, the electrical signal is also amplified by an
amplifier). Thereafter, the phase difference is measured. In this case, phase
conditions must be sufficiently taken into consideration to constitute the
apparatus.In Applied Optics, vol. 29, no 31, November 1990, New York US,
pages 4578-4582, R.I. MacDonald et al, "Frequency domain optical
reflectometer using a GaAs optoelectronic mixer", a frequency domain optical
reflectometer which uses a GaAs interdigital photodetector both for optical
detection and for mixing is described. A simple receiver with a postdetection
bandwidth of the order of 10 kHz is sufficient for distance resolution of 10 m
with the technique described, simplifying the electronics by comparison with
pulsed reflectometers or swept frequency reflectometers employing electronic
mixing. The use of lasers could enable the instrument to detect discrete optical
reflections of - 57 dB at a distance of 1 km. The reflector comprises a sweep
oscillator which generates a constant amplitude input
