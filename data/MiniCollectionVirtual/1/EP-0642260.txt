<ABSTRACT>
A video printer for transferring an image from an ink ribbon to a print sheet (5) 
has a print medium detector (16) for detecting the type of a print medium (4) and 

outputting medium data indicative of the detected type, a memory (18) for storing image 
data to be printed, and a keyboard (19) for inputting reversal information indicating 

whether the image data stored in the memory (18) are to be reversed or not. A reversing 
unit selectively outputs the image data stored in the memory (18) and reversed image 

data which are a reversal of the image data stored in the memory (18) . A gamma 
correcting circuit (22) adjusts image density of the image data with image density 

adjusting data, or a gamma curve, (g) selected from a plurality of sets of image density 
adjusting data or gamma curves (g₁,g₂,g₃) each having a different image density 

characteristic, and outputs the image data with the adjusted image density. A thermal 
head (24) transfers an image represented by the image data with the adju
sted image 
density to the print sheet (5) with an ink ribbon. The video printer has a controller (17) 

for controlling the reversing unit based on the reversal information and controlling the 
gamma correcting circuit (22) to select the image density adjusting data (g) based on 

both the reversal information and the medium data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video printer for printing video information on
a transfer print medium.There has heretofore been known a thermal transfer printer which is supplied
with an image signal from an image data input device such as a camera, a videotape
recorder, or the like, and heats and presses a thermal transfer ribbon against a print sheet
with a thermal head to print an image on the print sheet. The thermal transfer ribbon and
the print sheet are referred to as a print medium. Such print media include a non-transfer
print medium for printing an image on a print sheet and a transfer print medium
for printing an image on a print sheet and then transferring the printed image
from the print sheet to another object.A conventional process of printing an image on a transfer print medium with a
thermal transfer printer will be described below. The transfer print medium has a print
sheet which is composed of a base sheet and a transfer sheet applied to the base sheet.
The transfer sheet doubles as a sheet on which an image is to be printed. After an image
has been printed on the transfer sheet of the print sheet, only the transfer sheet with the
printed image is applied from the base sheet to an object such as a cup, a piece of cloth,
or the like by way of thermal transfer. The image printed on the transfer sheet now
appears as if printed on the object itself. The image transferred to the object is a
horizontal reversal of the image which is printed on the transfer sheet.US-A-5,075,785 discloses horizontal reversal of a (partial) image.Even if the object has a curved surface such as a side wall of a cup, an image can
easily be transferred to the curved surface by printing the image on a print sheet and then
applying only the transfer sheet to the object by way of thermal transfer.The thermal transfer printer is usually designed to print images on non-transfer
print media. Therefore, the thermal transfer printer has conventionally effected a single
gamma correction process so that an image printed on the print sheet of a non-transfer
print medium can clearly be seen, or stated otherwise, has a proper image density. Density adjustement based on the type of print medium is disclosed in EP-A-0 267 805.
However, if an image is printed on a transfer print medium by the thermal transfer printer
and then transferred to an object, then since the image has not been gamma-corrected
based on the transfer characteristics of the transfer print medium, the quality of the
transferred image depends upon the
