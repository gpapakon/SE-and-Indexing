plurality of parallel-axis pillars (3b) having a stationary 

plate (6), moving plate (7), pressure heel (10), and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a toggle-action clamp 
for presses of the kind used for injection molding plastics 
materials, comprising:
 
   at least a pair of pillars having parallel axes 
and a stationary plate mounted on axial ends thereof;
 
   a moving plate guided along said pillars for 
sliding movement toward and away from the stationary plate 
to clamp a mold between said plates;
 
   a pressure heel associated with said pillars on 
the opposite side from the stationary plate with respect to 
the moving plate; and
 
   a toggle-action mechanism arranged to act between 
the pressure heel and the moving plate and cause the latter 
to perform predetermined mold clamping and releasing 
strokes, respectively, and apply a predetermined closing 
load to the mold. The invention also concerns a press for injection 
molding plastics materials which incorporates a 
toggle-action clamp according to the invention. In the plastics injection molding industry, 
toggle-action clamps have been known in a range of different 
designs. Some prior constructions are illustrated in 
Perucca, "Dizionario di Ingegneria", UTET Publishers, at the 
entry "Stampaggio". A first example of a clamp is the so-called direct 
toggle-action clamp. In that clamp, the toggle-action 
mechanism is arranged to drive the moving plate toward and 
away from the stationary plate, as well as to clamp the mold 
by application of a predetermined mold closing load.  The toggle-action mechanism has a number of 
well-recognized advantages. Some of these relate to that, 
for a given rate of advance or the plunger to which the 
moving plate is connected via a crosshead device, a fast 
advance rate during the initial portion of the stroke and 
slow advance rate during the final portion can be obtained 
for the moving plate. The clamping phase, being a slow one, 
takes place under a condition of high mold preloading. The 
release phase likewise takes place at a slow rate, because 
the mechanism operation is reversed. Accordingly, the moving 
plate can be applied a large force through the toggle-action 
mechanism for opening the mould. This prior approach has, however, some 
disadvantages. Among these is the fact that the stroke 
distances travelled by the moving plate are relatively short 
ones, being usually on the same order of magnitude as the 
pillar spacing. Thus, with presses which have a limited 
pillar spacing, and hence a short stroke length of the 
moving plate, it becomes difficult, if not altogether 
impossible, to mold pieces which are

pressure heel relatively to said stop heel and said pillars

heel (17) and the pressure heel (10) with the pressure heel 

 
in said working position, and the moving plate (7) is driven
