<ABSTRACT>
A filter device is described which has a shell and a central tube connected to the shell. A metal-free filter cartridge is arranged in the filter device, which filter cartridge has a filter element folded in a zig-zag shape. The filter element is provided on the ends with end discs which are constructed so as to be elastic. At least one of the elastic end discs is fitted with a flexible support ring which is situated in the immediate vicinity of a radial seal formed by the end disc.

<CLAIMS>
Filter apparatus, having

a housing,
a central tube (14, 17) connected to the housing,
an opening for the medium to be filtered, and an opening for the
filtered medium,

the removal of the filtered medium being effected through a central tube
(14, 17),
a metal-free filter cartridge, which has a concentrically disposed,
zig-zag-folded filter element (10, 11, 12),

the filter element being provided, on the end faces, with end discs (10,
11), and at least one end disc being resilient, and the resilient end disc

(10, 11) forming a radial seal,
characterised in that
, on the resilient end disc in the immediate region of
the radial seal, a flexible web ring (13) is embedded in the resilient end

disc, which ring assists the action of the radial seal.
Filter apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
radial seal lies on the internal bore of the end disc.
Filter apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
radial seal is provided on the circumferential face of the resilient end disc

(10, 11), and the support ring (13) is disposed in the immediate vicinity
of this circumferential face. 
Filter apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the ratio
between the thickness of the web ring and the thickness of the resilient

end disc is 1 : 4.
Filter apparatus according to one of the previous claims,

characterised in that
 the flexible web ring (13) extends as far as and into
the region of the radial seal.
Filter apparatus according to one of the previous claims,

characterised in that
 the central tube (17) has at least two slightly
different diameters.
Filter apparatus according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the
larger diameter of the central tube (17) is situated at the front end when

viewed with respect to the direction of insertion of the cartridge.
Filter apparatus according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the
filter element is provided, on its end faces, with end discs (10, 11) which

have identical sealing face diameters.
Filter cartridge, more especially for a filter apparatus according to
claim 1, which has a concentrically disposed, zig-zag-folded filter

element, the filter element being provided, on the end faces, with end
discs (10, 11), and at least one end disc being resilient, and the resilient

end disc (10, 11) forming a radial seal, 
characterised in that
, on the
resilient end disc in the immediate region of the radial seal, a flexible

web ring (13) is embedded in the resilient end disc, which ring assists the
