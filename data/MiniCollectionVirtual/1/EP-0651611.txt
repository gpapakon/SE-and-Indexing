<ABSTRACT>
Blended cholesterol-reduced animal fat and vegetable oil which are combined in a proportion such that the weight ratio of linoleic acid (18:2) content divided by myristic acid (14:2) content is between 2 and 9 inclusive. In addition, cholesterol-reduced animal fat can be blended with cholesterol-reduced fish oil to stabilize the fish oil against air-oxidation at room temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fat blends and methods for
their manufacture and use.Hayes et al., 53 J. Clin. Nutr. 491, 1991, and Khosla
and Hayes, 55 M. J. Clin. Nutr. 51, 1992 (not admitted to
be prior art to the present application) describe the
effect of various fat blends formed from five different
plant oils on plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels in
non-human primates. The response to specific saturated
fatty acids was assessed in three species of monkey known
to differ in their susceptibility to atherosclerosis and
in their plasma cholesterol response to consumption of
saturated fat.Pronczuk et al., 26 Lipids 213, 1991, describe
experiments on the effect of various animal fats (butter,
tallow, lard, and fish oil) upon three species of monkey.
They state that substitution of fish oil for corn oil
decreases plasma cholesterol despite the fish oil diet
containing more saturated fatty acid than the corn oil
diet.Mensink and Katan, 323 New England Journal of
Medicine 439, 1990, and Zock and Katan 33 J. Lipid
Research 399, 1992 describe the deleterious effect of
dietary trans fatty acids on depressing high density (HDL)
and increasing low density (LDL) lipoprotein cholesterol
levels in healthy subjects. Such a shift in the serum
lipoprotein profile is thought to be atherogenic.Hegsted et al., 17 American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition 281, 1965, describe the effects of dietary fat
on serum cholesterol in man. Test oils were used
primarily incorporating them into recipes for many
products such as waffles, muffins, cakes, cookies, pie
crusts, biscuits, salad dressings, and spreads for bread. EP-A-0 340 635 teaches fish oils that are substantially free from cholesterol, have improved
flavour and oxidative stabilities and are less harmful to health. Blending said oils with
vegetable oils, particularly corn oil, further improves oxidative and flavour stability. Applicant has discovered that specific blends of
animal fats as in the set of claims and vegetable oils or fish oils are effective
in maintaining low serum cholesterol levels in mammals,
such as humans and other primates. These blends are
useful not only as dietary constituents that favorably
modulate plasma cholesterol but also provide advantageous
use in various cooking procedures, such as in deep-fat
frying and baking, in dairy products e.g., frozen deserts
(such as ice cream) or yogurt, creams, cheeses, spreads
(such as butter/margarine blends), in diet drinks, in
foods for specialized diets (e.g., hospital foods), and in
other blended products,

<CLAIMS>
An oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend comprising a cholesterol-reduced
animal fat selected from the group consisting of tallow, lard, butter fat, egg fat, milk fat, mutton fat, chicken fat, and turkey fat and a vegetable oil proportionally combined to provide a fat

blend comprising a linoleic acid (18:2) content and a myristic acid (14:0)
content in an 18:2/14:0 weight ratio of between 2 and 9 inclusive, wherein a

cholesterol-reduced animal fat is an animal fat which contains less
than 50% of its original cholesterol content.
The oxidation-resistant fat oil blend of claim 1 comprising:

(a) from one to ten parts by weight cholesterol-reduced animal fat;
and
(b) one part by weight vegetable oil having linoleic acid.
The oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend of claim 1 or 2 wherein between
50% and 99.9% of the cholesterol has been removed from said animal

fat.
The oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein
said cholesterol-reduced animal fat contains less than 40 milligrams

cholesterol per 100 grams animal fat.
The oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein
said cholesterol-reduced animal fat contains less than 10% of its original

cholesterol content.
The oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein
said weight ratio of said fat to said oil is selected to provide a blend

whose stability to oxidation upon heating to a temperature of 100 Â°C or
greater in air is increased at least 25% compared to the oxidation

resistance of said oil when heated separately from said fat blend. 
The oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend of any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein
said vegetable oil is selected from an oil comprising linoleic acid.
The oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend of claim 7, wherein
said oil is selected from the group consisting of safflower oil, sunflower

oil, corn oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, canola oil, olive oil
and palm olein.
The oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend of any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein
said blend comprises cholesterol-reduced tallow, and an oil selected

from the group consisting of: soybean, cottonseed, corn, canola,
sunflower, palm olein, safflower and peanut.
A method for forming an oxidation-resistant fat-oil blend according to
any one of claims 1 to 9 comprising the step of combining a

cholesterol-reduced animal fat selected from the group consisting of tallow, lard, butter fat, egg fat, milk fat, mutton fat, chicken fat, and turkey fat with a vegetable oil such that the
linoleic acid content and myristic acid content are in a weight

ratio of between 2 and 9 inclusive. 
A method of stabilizing a vegetable oil against oxidation comprising the
step of adding:


(a) a cholesterol-reduced animal fat as defined in any one of claims 1 and 3 to 5; to
(b) a vegetable oil as defined in any one of claims 1, 7 and 8,
such that the linoleic acid content and myristic acid content are

in a weight ratio of between 2 and 9 inclusive.
A method of stabilizing a polyunsaturated vegetable oil against oxidation
comprising the step of adding


(a) from one to ten parts by weight of cholesterol-reduced animal fat; to
(b) one part by weight of the polyunsaturated vegetable oil to be

wherein the combination of (a) and (b) has greater oxidation resistance
than component (b) by itself and wherein the cholesterol-reduced animal fat
