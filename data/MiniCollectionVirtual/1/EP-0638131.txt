<DESCRIPTION>
Vapor degreasing and solvent cleaning with 
fluorocarbon based solvents have found widespread use 
in industry for the degreasing and otherwise cleaning 
of solid surfaces, especially intricate parts and 
difficult to remove soils. In its simplest form, vapor degreasing or solvent 
cleaning consists of exposing a room temperature object 
to be cleaned to the vapors of a boiling solvent. 
Vapors condensing on the object provide clean distilled 
solvent to wash away grease or other contamination. 
Final evaporation of solvent from the object leaves 
behind no residue as would be the case where the object 
is simply washed in liquid solvent. For difficult to remove soils where elevated 
temperature is necessary to improve the cleaning action 
of the solvent, or for large volume assembly line 
operations where the cleaning of metal parts and 
assemblies must be done efficiently and quickly, the 
conventional operation of a vapor degreaser consists of 
immersing the part to be cleaned in a sump of boiling 
solvent which removes the bulk of the soil, thereafter 
immersing the part in a sump containing freshly 
distilled solvent near room temperature, and finally 
exposing the part to solvent vapors over the boiling 
sump which condense on the cleaned part. In addition, 
the part can also be sprayed with distilled solvent  
 
before final rinsing. Cold cleaning is another application where a 
number of solvents are used. In most cold cleaning 
applications, the soiled part is either immersed in the 
fluid or wiped with rags or similar objects soaked in 
solvents and allowed to air dry. Fluorocarbon solvents, such as 
trichlorotrifluoroethane, have attained widespread use 
in recent years as effective, nontoxic, and 
nonflammable agents useful in degreasing applications 
and other solvent cleaning applications. 
Trichlorotrifluoroethane has been found to have 
satisfactory solvent power for greases, oils, waxes and 
the like. It has therefore found widespread use for 
cleaning electric motors, compressors, heavy metal 
parts, delicate precision metal parts, printed circuit 
boards, gyroscopes, guidance systems, aerospace and 
missile hardware, aluminum parts and the like. Azeotropic or azeotrope-like compositions are 
desired because they do not fractionate upon boiling. 
This behavior is desirable because in the previously 
described vapor degreasing equipment with which these 
solvents are employed, redistilled material is 
generated for final rinse-cleaning. Thus, the vapor 
degreasing system acts as a
