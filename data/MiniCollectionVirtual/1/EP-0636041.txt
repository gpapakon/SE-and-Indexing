<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for producing a cardioversion waveform of less than about 5 Joules to be delivered to two or more implanted electrodes in a human patient in response to a sensing of a myocardial arrhythmia and a method for operating the apparatus, produces a cardioversion waveform that has an optimized pulse duration shorter than the pulse duration of a defibrillation waveform. The apparatus includes capacitor means, high voltage charging circuit means for charging the capacitor means, and switch means for selectively controlling a time-truncated discharge of the capacitor means through the electrodes. The optimum pulse duration is set automatically by the apparatus based on an optimization of an effective current of the electrical pulse. In one embodiment, the predetermined optimum pulse duration is optimized for an amount of electrical energy required from a battery system that is necessary to store the preselected amount of electrical energy in the capacitor means such that an overall displacement volume of the battery system is reduced. In another embodiment, the predetermined optimum pulse duration is optimized for an amount the preselected amount of electrical energy in the capacitor means that is delivered to the electrodes such that the predetermined pulse duration of the cardioversion waveform essentially matches an average cardioversion chronaxie value of the myocardium of the human patient, whereby an overall pain level of the cardioversion waveform is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with an apparatus for
producing a cardoversion waveform of less than about 5 joule
to be delivered to two or more implanted electrodes in a
human patient, as recited in the preamble of claim 1.Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) systems now on the
market and in use for clinical studies typically employ capacitors of 120 to
180 microfarads to deliver a defibrillation countershock. In order to
minimize the complexity of the ICD system, current ICDs use the same
capacitor to deliver both the defibrillation countershock and a
cardioversion pulse. For similar reasons, the same pulse duration for
defibrillation countershocks is also used for cardioversion pulses. Because
the energy employed for cardioversion pulses is some four to twenty times
less than for defibrillation countershocks (1-5 joules versus 20-40 joules),
the voltages used to deliver cardioversion pulses from the same capacitor
are correspondingly smaller than the voltages for defibrillation
countershocks. Unfortunately, low voltages in the later portions of a
stimulation pulse are less effective in terminating tachycardia, and may
even induce acceleration or fibrillation.It is worthwhile to provide some background on ICDs.
Defibrillation, or causing the cessation of chaotic and uncoordinated 
contraction of the ventricular myocardium by application of an electrical
direct current and voltage, in its most primitive form goes back to the last
century. [J. L. Provost and F Battle, "Sur Quelques Effets Des Descharges
Electriques sir I Couer Des Mammifers, "Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires
Des Seances t L ''Acadmie Des Sciences, Vol. 129, p. 1267, 1899.] Because of
the large currents required for defibrillation, large-area electrodes are
usually employed. [A. C. Gotten and J. Satterfield, "Factors Concerned In
Defibrillation of the Heart, Particularly through the Unopened Chest,"
Am. J. of Physiology, Vol. 167, p. 81, 1951.]For reasons of simplicity and compactness, capacitor-discharge
systems are almost universally used in defibrillation. The discharge of a
capacitor C through a resistance R results in a curve of voltage versus
time, and hence, of current versus time as well, that is a declining
exponential function, with a characteristic time constant given by the
product RC. It has also been recognized for some time that the long -
duration, low-amplitude "tail" of such a capacitor discharge pulse can be
detrimental. [J. C. Skidder, G. A. Rahmoeller, and H. Stickily,

switch means (36) to be the sum of: a first value derived from

a first predetermined percentage of an RC time constant, with R
being a myocardial tissue resistance value and C being the 

effective capacitance value of the means; and a second value
derived from a second predetermined percentage of a cardioversion

chronaxie value.
