<ABSTRACT>
A noise limited, video, digital to analog converter having an 
output transition time control with multiple discrete 

transition times. This is accomplished by a DAC control 
circuit in which the slew rate of the current is controlled by 

providing set current levels in the inverters that drive the 
DAC output current switches thus limiting the current available 

for charging and discharging the capacitance on the nodes which 
control the output signal. Additional control is provided by 

voltage clamping of these nodes which reduces the input voltage 
to the analog output and results in a cleaner output waveform. 

By so regulating and controlling the charging and discharging 
of these nodes, the variations in operation of the circuit due 

to the process used to produce the circuit in integrated form 
as well as temperature and supply voltage are further 

substantially reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digital-to-analog (DAC) convertors 
and more particularly to control circuits in such convertors 
for controlling current turn-on or turn-off rates, i.e., the 
"slew rates". The output waveform of a video digital analog convertor (DAC) 
may contain current changes or steps that cause radiation of 
electromagnetic waves. This radiation can interfere with other 
communication and control signals in the same RF bands. One 
method of reducing such unwanted emissions is by reducing the 
harmonic content of the video signal. Many attempts to address problems of this nature have been 
tried in the past.These attempts include utilizing transistors 
responsive to control signals for applying a reverse biasing 
potential to a reference voltage transistor and a digital input 
transistor at a rate such that there is little surge current in 
the reference transistor when the DAC is switched between its 
sleep mode and its regular operating mode. Such a circuit is 
shown in USP 5,184,129, issued Feb. 3 1993, to Fung et al. Similarly in USP 5,023,614 also issued to Fung et al, there is 
taught the use of a control transistor responsive to control 
signals for applying a reverse bias to a reference voltage 
transistor in each stage at a rate such that the rate of change 
of current in the reference voltage transistor is less than a 
predetermined magnitude.  The present invention is a unique DAC control circuit which not 
only is simpler than known circuits, but also achieves faster 
and better control of the slew rate of the current in such 
circuits. These are achieved by controlling the current 
available for charging or discharging the capacitance on the 
input signal nodes which control the DAC current switch 
providing the output signals. By so regulating and controlling 
the charging and discharging of these nodes, the current 
variations due to the process used to produce the circuit in 
integrated form as well as effects due to temperature and 
supply voltage are eliminated. The present invention thus results in a noise limited, video, 
digital to analog converter having an output transition time 
control with multiple discrete transition times. More specifically the present invention provides a DAC control 
circuit in which the slew rate of the current is controlled by 
providing set current levels in the inverters that drive the 
DAC output current switches thus limiting the current 
available for charging and discharging the capacitance on the 
nodes which control the output
