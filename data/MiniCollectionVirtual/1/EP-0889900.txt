MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES SPECIFIC TO ENDOTHELIAL CELL CADHERINS AND USES THEREOF 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONEndothelial cells constitute an important interface lining the internal vascular surface and regulating the passage of plasma proteins and circulating cells from blood to tissues. (Caveda et al., J. Clin. Invest. 98(4): 886-893, August, 1996).Endothelial permeability is regulated by intercellular junctions. These junctions are complex structures formed by transmembrane adhesive molecules, such as cadherins, linked to a network of cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal proteins. Adhesive molecules regulate leukocyte extravasation, endothelial cell growth, and permeability. (Dejana, E. et al , Review: Endothelial Cell-to-Cell Junctions, FASEB J., 9:910-918 (1995). Cadherins are adhesive glycoproteins that mediate homotypic cell-to-cell adhesion, are calcium-dependent, and protease-sensitive. All cell types that form solid tissues express some members of the cadherin family and each member displays a homophilic binding specificity. Members of the cadherin superfamily share a common basic structure. The common structures of cadherins include an N-terminal extracellular domain that determines binding specificity; a ydrophobic transmembrane domain; and a C- terminal cytoplasmic domain. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which is highly conserved among the superfamily members, interacts with the cytoskeleton through catenins and other proteins. Some cadherins, however, lack a cytoplasmic domain. The most important biological role of cadherins is to support homotypic cell aggregation and segregation, which during embryogenesis promote the formation of defined tissues and organs. (Brevario, F., et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol. 15:1229-1239 (1995)).Despite their similar biochemical properties, each cadherin is characterized by a different spatiotemporal pattern of expression and cell binding specificity. For 

example, in humans, E-cadherin, or uvomorulin, is essentially found in epithelia and in subsets of neurons. N-cadherin is expressed in the nervous system and in skeletal and cardiac muscles, and P-cadherin exhibits a widespread distribution. (Takeichi, M., Annu. Rev. Biochem. 59:237-252 (1990)). Vascular endothelial cadherins (VE-cadherins) are endothelial-specific cadherins strictly localized at intercellular junctions of essentially all types of endothelium. (Brevario, F., et al. 1995) VE-cadherins are so far the only cadherins consistently organized at interendothelial adherence junctions.
