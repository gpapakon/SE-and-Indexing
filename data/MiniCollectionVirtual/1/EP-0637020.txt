<ABSTRACT>
A cassette lid opening and closing system for a magnetic recording 
and/or reproducing apparatus, capable of opening a cassette lid 20a during 

seating a tape cassette 20 on a deck and closing it after seating the tape 
cassette 20 thereby to lower the height of the deck, includes a lid-opening 

member operating link 45 for swinging a lid-opening member 44 to open the 
lid 20a during seating a cassette holder 40 on a slider 50, a lever 70 for 

closing the open lid 20a by releasing a lid-pressing operation of the lid-opening 
member 44 when the tape cassette 20 is seated on a lower chassis 60, 

and a lever operator 80, 90 for operating the lever 70, so that the cassette lid 
20a is closed during reproducing a signal from a tape, to allow for 

manufacturing a very thin deck.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recording cassette
mechanisms, and is concerned particularly with cassette
lid opening and closing systems for magnetic recording
and/or reproducing apparatus.Magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus such
as video tape recorders (VTRs) have already been developed
in various types, and now, they are very popular in daily
life through increasing demands as an important household
commodity.Most magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus
for video use utilise a 1/2 inch tape cassette which
adopts a video home system (VHS). Such a magnetic
recording and/or reproducing apparatus typically includes
a cassette holder into which the tape cassette is
inserted, driving members for internally pulling the
cassette holder into a body of the apparatus to seat it on
a main deck, means for loading and unloading a magnetic
tape within the tape cassette toward a rotary drum
installed on the main deck, and means for allowing the
magnetic tape to travel along a predetermined path.Once the tape cassette is inserted into the cassette
holder, the insertion is sensed, and the tape cassette is
then placed safely on the main deck. In this state, the
magnetic tape is loaded toward the rotary drum rotating at
high speed by means of a pair of pole bases, thereby to
record signals to or reproduce signals from the magnetic
tape.Recently, in pursuit of users' convenience, a product
such as a portable camcorder, which has been developed 
from such magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus,
has become minimized is size as well as in weight. Also,
to assist in realizing a light and miniature product, a
product adopting an already-developed 8mm tape cassette is
generally known to public.On the other hand, for the reason that one factor
among those greatly affecting the miniaturization and
lightening of the product is the deck size, a product can
be miniaturized and lightened according to a scaled-down
rate of deck size and technical progress can be measured
by the scaled-down rate of deck size. Also, in actual
application, magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus
of various types are studied and developed.In order to maximally scale down the deck size while
simplifying the components, the present applicant has
filed Korean Patent Application No. 93-5016 relating to a
magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus, in which a
tape cassette is inserted into a cassette holder provided
with a rotary drum, for primary loading of a magnetic
tape, and the cassette holder is then pressed to be
close

<CLAIMS>
A cassette lid opening and closing system for a
magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus, the

system comprising:

a cassette holder (40) arranged to pivot by a
predetermined angle around a shaft (40a) on one side of

the holder (40) and to hold a cassette tape (20);
a slider (20) having a reel (53) for guiding a hub of
said tape cassette (20) and being arranged to slide said

cassette holder (40);
a lid-opening member (44) for opening a lid (20a) of
said tape cassette (20) during seating of said cassette

holder (20) on said slider (50);
a lid-opening member operating link (45) having a
first end resiliently mounted within an elongated hole

(50c) formed in one side of said slider (50), a second end
thereof being supported to pivot with respect to said lid-opening

member (44) to cause said lid-opening member (44)
to
 open said lid (20a) when said cassette holder (40) is
seated on said slider (50), the cassette lid opening and

closing system being characterised by a lever (70) for
moving said first end of said lid-opening member operating

link (45) when said tape cassette (20) is seated on a
chassis (60) to release a lid-pressing operation of said

lid-opening member (44), and by lever operating means
comprising a roller (80) having a central axis connected

to one end of said lever (70) and arranged to run within
an elongated hole (50d) formed in said slider (50) and a

guide block (90) disposed on said chassis to guide said
roller (80) to allow said roller (80) to run within said 

elongated hole (50d) to operate said lever (70) and close
the open lid (20a) of said tape cassette (20) when said

tape cassette (20) is seated on said chassis (60).
A cassette lid opening and closing system as claimed
in claim 1, wherein said guide block (90) has an inclined

face for contact with said roller (80) to open and close
said lid (20a) during unloading and loading of said tape

cassette (20).
A magnetic tape recording and/or reproducing
apparatus provided with a system according to claim 1, or

2.
