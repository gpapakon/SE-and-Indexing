<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes an optimization method for a detection circuit of a tachyarrhythmia detector used with direct cardiac electrodes. This method is applied to the detection of a ventricular fibrillation and of a multifocal ventricular tachyarrhythmia, with rejection of the T wave and of the stimulation artefact. The detection circuit optimized by means of this method comprises a third-order high-pass filter 5 followed by at least one comparator 8, with a filter cut-off frequency close to 16 Hz and a comparator threshold close to 0.40 mV normalized to the input, in the pass band.

<CLAIMS>
A detection circuit for a tachyarhythmia detector, comprising a high-pass filter (5)
and a threshold comparator (8) connected to the output of the filter (5), characterised

in that the filter (5) is of the third order and presents a cut-off frequency of
approximately 16 Hz.
The detection circuit of claim 1, characterised in that said comparator (8) has a
threshold value of approximately 0.40 mV referred to the input of the filter (5), in the

pass-band.
The detection circuit of claim 2, characterised in that said threshold value is
programmable or automatically adjusted, within a range comprising 0.40 mV.
