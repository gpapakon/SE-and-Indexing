<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive latex composition which is water-insoluble when dried comprising: A) a pressure sensitive adhesive latex which is alkali-dispersible when dried, such as a copolymer of n-butyl acrylate, methacrylic acid and hydroxyethyl acrylate; B) a pressure sensitive adhesive latex which is non-alkali-dispersible when dried, such as n-butyl acrylate based copolymer latex, and, optionally, one or more tackifiers. The tackifier, if used, may be a mixture of at least one tackifier having a softening point of less than 55  C and at least one tackifier having a softening point between 55  C and 150  C. Paper containing the water-insoluble adhesive latex composition can be readily recycled into good quality paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to polymer latex compositions, more particularly, to
pressure sensitive adhesive latex compositions.Pressure sensitive adhesives are commonly a polymeric material which, when
dried, is aggressively and permanently tacky at room temperature. A typical pressure sensitive
adhesive will firmly adhere to a variety of dissimilar surfaces upon mere contact without the
need of more than finger- or hand-applied pressure.DE-A-1 814 115 is directed to a pressure sensitive adhesive composition comprising
a terpolymer of 80-96 parts 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2.0 - 19 parts N-octyl acrylamide and
1-4 parts acrylamide or methacrylamide, the sum of the parts of N-octyl acrylamide and
methacrylamide or acrylamide being at least equal to 4.
The composition further comprises from 1-10 parts, per 100 parts of solids of said terpolymer,
of an acrylic terpolymer resin of an acrylic terpolymer comprising 30-40 weight percent
1-butyl acrylamide, 55-65 weight percent ethyl acrylate, and 5-15 weight percent acrylic
acid, wherein the acrylic terpolymer resin is alkali-soluble.The application teaches a water-resistant (i.e. water-insoluble) latex composition
which is obtained by adding an alkali-soluble latex to an acrylamide-based latex.
More particularly, this German patent application specifically teaches that without the alkali-soluble
latex, the acrylamide-based latex, although exhibiting good tack and bonding
strength, lacks water resistance. Thus, the objective of this application is to render a water-soluble
latex insoluble by adding an alkali-soluble latex.Due to increasing environmental concerns, efforts are being made to recycle
fabricated products, such as, for example, paper and adhesive paper labels. In one recycling
method, paper products are heated, with agitation, in water or dilute alkali to cause the paper
to disintegrate into its component fibers. When a non-dispersible adhesive is present, the
paper fibers will break away from the adhesive leaving large lumps and films of adhesive
within the disintegrated fiber mass. These lumps and films can eventually show up in the
repulped (recycled) paper as blotches and irregularities. As a result, the recycled paper is
considered of lower quality than non-recycled paper. This is due not only to its non-uniform
properties including variations in the ability of its surface to retain ink, but also to the presence
of adhesive lumps or films thereon. Additionally, process difficulties can arise in repulping
paper due to the adhesion of the adhesive
