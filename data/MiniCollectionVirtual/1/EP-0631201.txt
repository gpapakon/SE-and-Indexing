<ABSTRACT>
A sheet sorting apparatus has been disclosed which 
comprises a plurality of bin trays (B) arranged 

substantially vertically with predetermined clearances 
between adjacent bin trays (B), the bin trays (B) being 

movable substantially in the vertical direction, wherein 
each of the bin trays (B) is provided with a pair of cam 

followers (30) at lateral sides thereof. The sheet sorting 
apparatus further comprises a pair of guiding members (7) 

for guiding the cam followers (30) for substantially 
vertical movement, discharging means (15) for discharging 

sheets (P) to the bin trays (B), and a pair of helical cams 
(40, 40') for shifting the cam followers (30) substantially 

in the vertical direction to expand the clearance facing 
the discharging means (15), the helical cams (40, 40') 

having helix directions which are opposite to each other, 
and being adapted to rotate in opposite rotational 

directions. The guiding members (7) are deflected at a 
position opposed to the helical cams (40, 40') such that, 

upon movement of the cam followers (30) by the helical cams 
(40, 40'), the cam followers (30) having passed through the 

deflected portion are deviated in a downstream direction 
with respect to the sheet discharging direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
postprocessor for processing sheets of paper, for
example, the sheets discharged from an image forming
apparatus such as a copying machine or a laser beam
printer, more particularly to a sheet sorter provided
with a number of bins for sorting and accommodating the
sheets and with a stapler for stapling a stack or set
of the sheets in each of the bins.A postprocessor has been proposed wherein the
sheets can be sorted and accommodated without
limitation by the number of bins, which will
hereinafter be called "limitless sorter", and wherein
sets of the sheets are stapled in the respective bins.For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,884,408
discloses a horizontal limitless sorter of a stationary
bin type wherein a carriage for carrying a stapler is
movable to the respective bins, and the stapler is
rotated away from the carriage to staple a stack of
sheets.Japanese Laid-Open Application Nos.
220053/1983 and 185355/1984 disclose a limitless sorter
wherein a stapler block moves substantially vertically,
expands the space between adjacent bins and inserts a
stapling head into the space to staple the stack of 
sheets.U.S. Patent No. 4,295,733 discloses a
limitless sorter wherein a set of sheets are gripped by
a gripper and is transported to a stapler by which it
is stapled.US-A-3 995 748 discloses a sorting apparatus with two guide
members each with an inclined ramp portion on the height
level of the discharging means. The cam followers of the bin
trays follow said ramp portions to expand the clearance facing
the discharging means.Those limitless sorter, however, involves a
problem in that
after having received the sheets a bin moving upwardly
along guide rails still interfere with the discharge means.
In addition, since the space between adjacent bins has
to be expanded enough to allow access of the stapler to
the sheets, the apparatus is bulky.Accordingly, it is a principal object of the
present invention to provide a sheet sorting apparatus
which overcomes the above problems.This object is solved by the features set forth in the
characterizing portion of claim 1. Advantageously developed
embodiments of the invention are subject matter of the
dependent claims 2 to 10.  These and other features and
advantages of the present invention will become more
apparent upon a consideration of the following
description of the preferred embodiments of the present 
invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying
drawings.Figure 1 is a side view of a sorter according

<CLAIMS>
A sheet sorting apparatus, comprising

a plurality of bin trays (B) which are arranged
substantially vertically above each other with predetermined

clearances between adjacent bin trays (B), and which are movable
substantially in the vertical direction, each of said bin trays

(B) being provided with a pair of cam followers (30) at lateral
sides thereof,
a pair of guiding members (7) for guiding said cam
followers (30) for substantially vertical movement,
discharging means (15) for discharging sheets (P) to said
