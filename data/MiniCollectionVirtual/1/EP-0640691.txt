<ABSTRACT>
Primers and methods for adapter-mediated multiplex amplification of the IS6110 
insertion element of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 (M.tb) and the 16S ribosomal gene of 

Mycobacterium tuberculosis
, useful for simultaneously detecting and/or identifying species of 
the 
M. tuberculosis
 complex and other clinically relevant Mycobacterium species. Multiplex 
Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA) is used in a single amplification reaction which is 

capable of simultaneously identifying 
M. tuberculosis
 and providing a screen for substantially 
all of the clinically relevant species of Mycobacteria. Also disclosed are methods for adapter-mediated 

multiplex amplification of multiple target sequences and a single internal control 
sequence for determination of sample efficacy or quantitation of the targets. In a preferred 

embodiment, an internal control sequence is included in the amplification reaction and 
coamplified with the IS6110 and 16S target sequences as an indication of sample amplification 

activity or to quantitate the initial amount of target sequences in the sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nucleic acid amplification and detection and/or
identification of microorganisms using nucleic acid amplification.In vitro nucleic acid amplification techniques have provided powerful tools for
detection and analysis of small amounts of nucleic acids. The extreme sensitivity of such
methods has lead to attempts to develop them for diagnosis of infectious and genetic diseases,
isolation of genes for analysis, and detection of specific nucleic acids as in forensic medicine.In general, diagnosis and screening for specific nucleic acids using nucleic acid
amplification techniques has been limited by the necessity of amplifying a single target
sequence at a time. In instances where any of multiple possible nucleic acid sequences may be
present (e.g., infectious disease diagnosis), performing multiple separate assays by this
procedure is cumbersome and time-consuming. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202 and
4,800,159 describe the PCR. Although these inventors state that multiple sequences may be
detected, no procedure for amplifying multiple target sequences simultaneously is disclosed.
When multiple target sequences are amplified, it is by sequentially amplifying single targets in
separate PCRs. In fact, when multiple pairs of primers directed to different target sequences 
are added to a single PCR, the reaction produces unacceptably high levels of nonspecific
amplification and background. An improvement on the PCR which reportedly allows
simultaneous amplification of multiple target sequences is described in published European
Patent Application No. 0 364 255. This is referred to as multiplex DNA amplification. In this
method; multiple pairs of primers are added to the nucleic acid containing the target sequences.
Each primer pair hybridizes to a different selected target sequence, which is subsequently
amplified in a temperature-cycling reaction similar to PCR. Adaptation of PCR to footprinting
is taught by P. R. Mueller and B. Wold (1989. Science 246, 780-786). For footprinting, a
common oligonucleotide sequence is ligated to the unique end of each fragment of the
footprint ladder. The fragments are simultaneously amplified using a primer complementary to
the common sequence and a primer complementary to the known sequence of the fixed end.In most cases, nucleic acid amplification techniques have been used to produce
qualitative results in diagnostic assays. However, there has been great interest in developing
methods for nucleic acid amplification which are not only
