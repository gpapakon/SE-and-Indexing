<ABSTRACT>
A coolant guard (50) for a rolling mill bearing assembly has a base 
flange (52) and an angularly 

disposed sealing flange (58), both molded integrally of an elastomeric 
material. The base flange (52) is 

reinforced by an embedded metallic hoop (66).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved coolant guard for use in oil film bearings
of the type employed in rolling mills.A typical rolling mill oil film bearing with a seal arrangement including a coolant guard
is shown in Figure 1. The roll 10 has an end face 12 joined by an intermediate tapered section
14 to a reduced diameter section 16 surrounded by a sleeve 18. The sleeve is keyed or
otherwise secured to the roll neck, and is journalled in a bushing 20 fixed within a chock 22.
Oil is supplied continuously between the sleeve and bushing, and a seal assembly generally
indicated at 24 surrounds the intermediate tapered section 14 to prevent oil from escaping from
the bearing and also to prevent externally applied cooling water and entrained contaminants such
as dirt, mill scale, etc. from penetrating into the bearing.The seal assembly 24 includes a flexible flanged neck seal 26 and a seal inner ring 28,
both of which are carried on the roll for rotation therewith, and a seal end plate 30 and coolant
guard 34, both of which are fixed in relation to the chock 22. This sealing arrangement is well
known to those skilled in the art, and thus little if any further explanation is required, except
perhaps with regard to the coolant guard 34.The coolant guard comprises an elastomeric molded component having a radially
extending mounting flange 36 and an integrally associated sealing flange 38. The mounting 
flange 36 is located in a circular recess 40 in the seal end plate 30, where it is surrounded by
a circular shoulder 41. The recess 40 has a flat annular mounting surface 42 against which the
mounting flange is secured by means of circumferentially spaced screws 44. When the mounting
flange 36 is thus secured, the sealing flange 38 extends angularly into resilient sealing contact
with the roll end face 12.The coolant guard provides the first line of defense against the unwanted and potentially
damaging ingress of cooling water and entrained contaminants into the bearing. It also
cooperates with the seal inner ring 28 to establish a sealing labyrinth leading to a drain opening
(not shown) in the seal end plate. Additionally, when the bearing is being removed from the
roll neck, the mounting flange 36 contacts the outermost peripheral flange of the seal inner ring
28 and exerts through it a force sufficient to pull both the inner seal ring and the neck seal 26
off of the roll neck. In order to facilitate this pulling action, the stiffness of the mounting flange
is elevated above that of the sealing flange by

A flexible coolant guard for use in a rolling mill bearing assembly rotatably
supporting a roll neck (14, 16), the guard preventing ingress of coolant into the

bearing and being adapted for mounting on a non-rotatable annular mounting surface
(42) of the assembly spaced axially from an end face (12) of a roll (10) supported by

the assembly to form a gap therebetween, the annular surface being disposed in a
plane perpendicular to the rotational axis of the roll neck, and the guard comprising:

a radially disposed annular base (52) having opposed front and rear surfaces (54, 56)
and an integral circular sealing flange (58) extending angularly away from the front

surface (54) such that, in use, with the rear surface (56) secured to the mounting
surface (42), the flange (58) extends across the said gap into sealing contact with the

roll, characterised in that the base (52) has an annular reinforcement member (66) at
least partially embedded therein, the member having a width extending in a direction

parallel to the rotational axis.
A coolant guard according to claim 1 in which the reinforcement member (66)
comprises a hoop, the hoop accommodating flexible radial deformation of the guard

in relation to the said axis while resisting any tendency of the base (52) to distort
axially away from the mounting surface (42).
A coolant guard according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the reinforcement
member (66) is metallic, the base (52) and the sealing flange (58) being molded from

an elastomeric material.
A coolant guard according to any one of the claims 1-3 wherein the base (52)
has a plurality of circumferentially spaced apertures (60) for accommodating fasteners

(44) to secure the base against the mounting surface (42), the reinforcement member
(66) being embedded in the base at a location disposed radially outwardly of the

apertures.
A coolant guard according to any one of the preceding claims wherein an outer
edge of the base (52) is configured to define circular front and rear shoulders (68, 70) 

respectively protruding axially from the front and rear surfaces (54, 56), the rear
shoulder (70) being adapted for reception in a circular recess (72) in the said

mounting surface.
A coolant guard according to claim 5 wherein the reinforcement member (66)
is only partially embedded in the base (52) and defines an exterior surface of the rear

shoulder (70).
A coolant guard according to claim 6 wherein the exterior surface defined by
the reinforcement member (66) is stepped inwardly from the said outer edge of the

base (52).
A coolant guard according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the
reinforcement member (66) has a front edge recessed inwardly from the said front

face (54) of the base (52), and a rear edge which protrudes rearwardly beyond the
said rear face (56) of the base (52).
The use of a flexible coolant guard according to any one of the preceding
claims in a rolling mill bearing assembly.
A rolling mill bearing assembly for rotatably supporting a roll neck (14, 16),
the assembly comprising: a non-rotatable annular mounting surface (42) spaced

axially from an end face (12) of a roll (10) supported by the assembly to define a gap
therebetween, the annular surface (42) surrounding the rotational axis of the roll neck

in a plane perpendicular to the axis; and a flexible coolant guard (50) for sealing the
said gap against ingress of coolant, the guard having a radially disposed annular base

(52) with a rear face (56) secured against the mounting surface (42) and an integral
circular sealing flange (58) extending angularly away from a front face (54) and

across the said gap into sealing contact with the roll, characterised in that the annular
base (52) of the coolant guard (50) has an annular reinforcement member (66) at least

partially embedded therein, the member (66) having a width extending in a direction
parallel to the rotational axis.
