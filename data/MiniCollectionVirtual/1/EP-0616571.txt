<DESCRIPTION>
 FLEXIBLE TUBULAR STRUCTURESThe present invention relates to a flexible tubular structure and particularly, although not exclusively, to a flexible tubular structure for use in the lining of passageways and methods relating thereto.A known method of lining an underground passageway, such as a sewer, involves placing a flexible tube, usually of felt impregnated with resin, in contact with the inside wall of the sewer and allowing the resin to cure so that a self-supporting tubular structure is created inside the sewer. Methods such as this are effective in lining passageways such as sewers which have, over the years, eroded or fallen into disrepair.Methods of lining passageways in this way can be roughly divided into two categories as follows:-The first category involves dragging or winching the resin-impregnated felt tube through the passageway and subsequently allowing the resin to harden so that a self- supporting tubular structure is formed. This method of introducing the flexible tube into the passageway can be difficult because of the relatively high friction between the flexible tube and the wall of the passageway, especially where the passageway to be lined includes bends and discontinuities.The second category of methods are those which involve everting the tube into the passageway using water pressure. In these methods the resin-impregnated felt tube is secured at one end at the entrance to the passageway to be lined, and then forced along the passageway, at the same time turning it inside out, by means of water pressure. 

 With either the winching or everting methods it has been found advantageous to have a resin-impermeable covering, usually at least on the outside of the flexible tube, which covering serves the purpose of retaining the resin in the felt tube when the tube is being transported to the passageway and/or introduced into the passageway. In the case of the eversion methods the resin-impermeable covering serves a second function in that, as the tube turns inside out the covering appears on the inside of the tube and this prevents the water used to assist the eversion process from washing away the resin before it has cured.A prior resin-impermeable covering comprises a film of polyurethane which is applied to the felt, prior to impregnation with resin, by either thermally welding a sheet of polyurethane to a sheet of felt or by calendering a molten mass of polyurethane onto a sheet of felt.When the sheet of felt has been covered by the polyurethane film a tube is formed by joining
