<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic product is produced by mixing a preform of metallic or ceramic fibers or a porous ceramic with 
at least one polysilazane (1) having a number-average molecular weight of 20 to 3,000 and a cold viscosity of less 

than 1 Pa.s and selected from among a polysilazane mainly comprising repeating units of the formula -[(SiH₂)
n
(NH)
r
]-(wherein 

n and r are each 1, 2 or 3) and derivatives based thereon, such as copolymers, modified polymers and 
cross-linked polymers, and at lease one polysilazane (2) selected from among ones having a number-average molecular 

weight of 200 to 100,000 and a cold viscosity of 100 Pa.s or above and solid ones, impregnating the mixture 
with a polysilazane-base polymer mixture having a number-average molecular weight of 200 to 3,000 and a cold 

viscosity of 100 Pa.s or less, hardening the resulting mixture by cross-linking, firing the same into a ceramic, and 
repeating these operations. Examples of the polysilazanes include inorganic polysilazane, inorganic polysiloxazane, 

polyorgano(hydro)silazane, modified polysilazane and polymetallosilazane. It is possible to inhibit the delamination 
of the fibers by applying CVD coating before or after the impregnation, hardening and firing of the preform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing ceramic products, and the ceramic products 
provided by the present invention include fiber 
reinforced ceramics and high density ceramics, which may 
be suitably used as structural materials in harsh 
environments of high temperature, corrosion, etc. More 
specifically, it relates to fiber reinforced ceramics 
made by reinforcing a silicon nitride-type matrix with 
metal or inorganic fiber, and to ceramic products which 
have been highly consolidated by impregnation into porous 
ceramics. Ceramics have excellent heat resistance, corrosion 
resistance and heat insulating properties in comparison 
to metal materials, and thus they have received attention 
as structural materials in place of metals in harsh 
environments of high temperature, corrosion, etc. 
However, ceramics cannot be deformed in the same way as 
metal materials, and stress becomes concentrated on 
defects in the material and flaws on the surface to lead 
to easy breakage, giving them the disadvantage of poor 
fracture toughness. In order to improve this fracture 
toughness of ceramics, particles or fibers are dispersed 
in the matrix to absorb the rupture energy. Methods for the production of fiber reinforced 
ceramics are largely classified into three types: powder 
sintering methods, CVD (CVI) methods and impregnation 
methods. 
(1) In powder sintering methods, a reinforcing 
material such as whiskers or the like is mixed with 
powder which forms a matrix, and this mixture is sintered 
at a high temperature of 1600°C or above. Since powder 
sintering requires high-temperatures to obtain a  
 
consolidated sintered body, its disadvantages include 
that it can only be used for a limited reinforcing 
materials. (2) CVD (CVI) methods involve deposition of a 
ceramic matrix from a gaseous precursor into spaces in a 
preform, which is made of inorganic fibers, whiskers or 
the like. In the CVD (CVI) method, the substance which 
is to form the ceramic matrix may also be filled into 
fine pores, but a large number of pores are left as 
closed pores, and it is generally difficult to fill more 
than 80% of the pores. Other problems encountered 
include long production time, high production costs and 
difficulty of application to large-sized forms due to 
limits of the apparatuses. (3) Impregnation methods involve impregnating a 
polymer which is converted into ceramic after heat 
treatment, into a preform made of inorganic fibers, 
whiskers or the like, and then firing it to form a 
matrix
