<ABSTRACT>
An excimer laser apparatus comprises a container (1)
sealing a laser gas including a halogen gas therein, a pair

of discharge electrodes (2) disposed in the container (1) for
inducing an electric discharge capable of oscillating a

laser light, and a circulating fan (3) with a shaft (4) for
producing a high-speed laser gas stream between a pair of

the discharge electrodes. Both ends of the shaft (4) are
rotatably supported by rotor-stator mechanisms, or one end

of the shaft is rotatably supported by a rotor-stator
mechanism, and the other end of the shaft is supported by a

magnetic bearing. The rotor-stator mechanism comprises a
rotor (11d,12d) attached to the shaft (4) of the circulating fan (3), a

stator (11b,12b) provided at a position opposed to the rotor, an electric
motor winding (14) provided in the stator for applying torque to

the rotor, and a position control winding (15) provided in the
stator for producing a magnetic force to levitate and

support the rotor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an excimer laser
apparatus having a circulating fan for producing a high-speed
laser gas stream, and more particularly to an excimer
laser apparatus having a feature in a motor for rotating a
shaft of a circulating fan and a magnetic bearing for
supporting the shaft of the circulating fan.FIG. 5 is a schematic view showing a structure of
a conventional excimer laser apparatus. As shown in FIG. 5,
the conventional excimer laser apparatus comprises a
container 41 sealing a laser gas including a halogen gas
such as a fluorine gas therein, ionization electrodes (not
shown) disposed in the container 41 for ionizing the laser
gas, and discharge electrodes 42, 42 disposed in the
container 41 for inducing an electric discharge capable of
oscillating a laser light. A circulating fan 43 for
producing a high-speed laser gas stream between a pair of
the discharge electrodes 42 and 42 is disposed in the
container 41.The circulating fan 43 has a shaft 44 penetrating
therethrough and protruding from both ends thereof. The
shaft 44 is supported in a non-contact manner by radial
magnetic bearings 51, 52 provided at both ends of the
container 41, and by an axial magnetic bearing 53 provided 
at one end of the container 41. A motor 54 is provided at a
shaft end side of the radial magnetic bearing 52.Displacement sensor targets 51c, 52c and
electromagnet targets 51d, 52d of the radial magnetic
bearings 51, 52, and a displacement sensor target 53d and an
electromagnet target 53e of the axial magnetic bearing 53
are secured to the shaft 44. Further, a rotor 54b of the
motor 54 is secured the shaft 44. Displacement sensors 51a,
52a, 53a, electromagnets 51b, 52b, 53b, 53c, and a stator
54a of the motor 54 are disposed at positions opposed to the
displacement sensor targets 51c, 52c, 53d, the electromagnet
targets 51d, 52d, 53e, and the rotor 54b.Thin cylindrical bulkheads 55, 56 are provided on
inner peripheral surfaces of the displacement sensors 51a,
52a and the electromagnets 51b, 52b of the radial magnetic
bearings 51, 52, and the stator 54a of the motor 54. The
bulkheads 55, 56 are formed of a material having corrosion
resistance to the halogen gas included in the laser gas,
e.g., austenitic stainless steel such as SUS316L. The
bulkheads 55, 56 prevent the displacement sensors 51a, 52a,
the electromagnets 51b, 52b, and the stator 54a from
contacting the laser gas.Like the radial magnetic bearings 51, 52, a
bulkhead 57 is provided on the inner peripheral surface of
the displacement sensor
