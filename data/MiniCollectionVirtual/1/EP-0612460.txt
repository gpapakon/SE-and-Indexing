<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a radio-telephone system capable of providing a temporary basic telecommunications service to regions with no coverage or insufficient coverage. Proposed is a system with a stellate operational structure characterized by a fixed base station and a multiplicity of mutually independent subscriber stations. At the base station, the various telephone channels are processed as a frequency-multiplexed signal. This multiplexed signal is preferably superimposed, with angle modulation, on an HF carrier wave and transmitted on a broad-band radio channel. In the direction of transmission from subscriber to base station, the subscriber stations transmit in narrow-band channels which are each of different frequency. For transmission of signalling and control commands, the system includes a special organization channel which is also integrated in the frequency-multiplexed signal. Compared with prior art procedures, this method has the advantage that very high requirements are placed on the intermodulation values of the assemblies and on the stability of the frequency-processing only for the processing of the multiplexed signal in the audio-frequency, i.e. low-frequency, range of the transmitter.

Method for radio transmission using a fixed base station and a plurality of
independent fixed subscriber's stations, in which analog signals having a

band width of the base signal being sufficient for telephone communication,
in particular for the transmission of the standard telephone frequency

spectrum from 300 Hz to 3 400 Hz are allowed to be transmitted by means
of the duplex operation on a plurality of radio channels between the base

station and the subscriber's stations, wherein different transmission
methods are used for the two transmission directions and the number of said

radio channels is smaller than the total number of the subscriber's stations
and each subscriber's station merely accesses to one duplex radio channel

at one moment and a direct transmission between the subscriber's stations
is excluded, wherein for the intrasystem purposes of signalling and

organization, and for the connection build-up in both transmission directions
as well one channel each is used as an executive channel (2, 10) which are

identical to the communication channels (1, 11) with respect to its physical
parameters in the respective transmission directions, and in which digital

information is transmitted in the time-division multiplexing, including the
following steps:


a) converting the signals of the individual communication channels (1)
inside said base station into channel specific carrier frequencies by

means of single-sideband modulation with a suppressed carrier for
generating single-sideband signals (4), wherein said narrow-band

channel specific carrier frequencies will be selected in a staggered
manner to each other by a fixed frequency separation,
b) adding up said single-sideband signals (4) and said executive channel
(2) to an FDM baseband (5), 
c) performing an angular modulation of said FDM baseband (5) onto an HF
carrier frequency,
d) amplifying the broadband modulated HF carrier signal (9), and radiating
said amplified HF carrier signal (9) via an antenna to said subscriber's

stations,
e) for the transmission direction from said subscriber's stations to said base
station, modulating the signals onto a channel raster specific HF carrier

such that said modulated HF carrier signal forms a communication
channel (11), wherein said subscriber's stations broadcast in respective

frequency-related different communication channels (11), and
f) amplifying and radiating said communication channel (11) via an
antenna to said base station.
Method for radio transmission according to claim 1 characterized in that, in
the transmission direction from said base station to said subscriber's

stations, said executive channel (2) processed as a single-sideband signal
(3) with a suppressed carrier is allocated into said FDM baseband (5) as a

channel 0 having the lowest frequency.
Method for radio transmission according to claims 1 or 2 characterized in
that, in the transmission di
rection from said subscriber's stations to said
base station, said executive channel (10) is positioned as a channel 0 in the

middle of a frequency band (f
UB1
 -f
UB2
) to be used, and said communication
channels (11) alternately follow above and below of said center frequency

as channels 1, 2, 3 ... up to the maximum number.
Method for radio transmission according to one of the preceding claims
characterized in that in said base station a pilot signal is generated which is

inserted into the multiplex signal of said base station.
