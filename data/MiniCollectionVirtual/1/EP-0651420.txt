<ABSTRACT>
Electrical apparatus comprises antenna means (200) for directing 
towards an electric field source to detect the electric field (E) to be 

reduced. The antenna means (200) is connected to amplifier means (210) 
for generating an output signal in response to an input signal from the 

antenna means (200). The output signal is in anti-phase to the input 
signal. Radiator means (140) is connected to the amplifier means (210) 

for radiating an cancelling electric field (E') in anti-phase to the 
electric field (E) from the source (100) in response to the output signal 

from the amplifier (210) to at least partially cancel reduce the electric 
field from the source (100). The antenna means (200), when directed 

towards the source (100), is positioned relative to the radiator means 
(140) and the source (100) to detect both the cancelling electric field 

(E') from the radiator means (140) and the electric field (E) from the 
source (100). The input signal produced by the antenna means (200) is 

thus derived from the sum of the electric field (E) to be reduced from 
the source (100) and the cancelling electric field (E') from the radiator 

(140).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for reducing electric
field emissions by the application of cancellation fields.A conventional raster scanned cathode ray tube (CRT) display such
as a television receiver or a computer visual display unit comprises
circuitry that can generate electric fields of sufficient strength to
radiate beyond the display. Various studies have raised public concern
about these electric fields and the possible health hazards associated
with them. As a result of these concerns various standards have been
introduced defining maximum emission levels which products claiming to
meet these standards can emit. In Northern Europe, for example, products
can be tested to a standard developed and administered by TCO, the
Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees. To meet a part of this
standard, true RMS values of emissions in the frequency band from 2kHz to
400kHz are measured and must be less than 1 Volt/metre.A CRT display typically comprises horizontal and vertical
electromagnetic deflection coils arranged on a yoke mounted around the
neck of the CRT. In operation, currents having a sawtooth waveform flow
through the coils to scan the electron beam or beams across the CRT
screen in a raster pattern. The voltages across the deflection coils
reach a peak during the retrace or flyback period of the sawtooth
currents. The peak voltage signals have a large component of harmonics of
the corresponding deflection frequencies.The electron beam or beams are accelerated from the neck of the CRT
towards the screen by a "final anode" or Extra High Tension (EHT) voltage
of typically 25kV for a colour display. The flow of electrons is referred
to as "beam current". The EHT voltage is typically generated from a step
up transformer synchronised to the line scan. In displays having
integrated horizontal deflection circuits and EHT generation, the voltage
pulse signal driving the primary of the transformer is derived from the
peak voltage across the horizontal deflection coil. In displays having
separate EHT generation and horizontal deflection circuits, the voltage
pulse signal is generated separately from the line scan signal, but may
be synchronised to it, although not necessarily in phase.The output impedance of the EHT generator is sufficiently high that
changes in beam current loading through screen content cause modulation 
of the EHT voltage. This is the primary source of radiated electric
fields in front of the display. This modulation of the internal CRT final
anode voltage is
