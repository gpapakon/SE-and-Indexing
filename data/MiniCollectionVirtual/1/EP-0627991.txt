<ABSTRACT>
An all-polymeric ultraviolet light reflective film which is lower in cost than previously used reflector materials, is weather resistant, and which does not absorb significant amounts of solar ultraviolet energy is provided. The film includes a sufficient number of alternating layers of at least first and second diverse polymeric materials which have an average percent transmission of greater than about 50 percent between wavelengths of 300 to 400 nm. A substantial majority of the individual layers of the film have optical thicknesses in the range where the sum of the optical thicknesses in a repeating unit of the polymeric materials is between 0.15  mu m to 0.228  mu m, and the first and second polymeric materials differ from each other in refractive index by at least about 0.03 in the wavelength range of from 300 to 400 nm. The reflective film is useful as a reflective material in solar detoxification systems, as a protective material in indoor and outdoor lighting systems, as a UV mirror in the fields of medical imaging, astronomical telescopes, and microscopy or in chemical reactions using UV radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 • ALL-POLYMERIC ULTRAVIOLET REFLECTING FILMThis invention relates to an all-polymeric ultraviolet reflecting film, and more particularly to a reflector which is substantially transparent to visible'and near infrared wavelengths while reflecting a substantial portion of solar ultraviolet wavelengths.The present invention provides an all polymeric ultraviolet light reflective film which is lower in cost than previously used reflector materials, is weather-resistant, and does not absorb significant amounts of solar ultraviolet energy. While a preferred use for the f i Im of the present invention is as a reflective material in solar detoxification systems, the film aiso is useful in other applications where ultraviolet light reflectivity, but visible light transparency is required.The terms "reflective", "reflectivity", "reflection", and "reflectance" as used herein refer to total reflectance (that is, ratio of reflected wave energy to incident wave energy) of a sufficiently specular nature. The use of these terms is intended to encompass semi- specular or diffuse reflection as well. In general, reflectance measurement refers to reflectance of light rays into an emergent cone with a vertex angle of 15 degrees centered around the specular angle. By the term "diverse" is meant that the polymeric materials need not differ in any respect except in terms of refractive index. Thus, while adjacent layers may be chemically diverse, if such materials have the same refractive index, then for purposes of the present invention they are not "diverse".A specific intensity of reflectance, when used herein, is the intensity of reflection which occurs at a wavelength where no substantial absorption occurs. For example, the films of the present invention are designed to reflect ultraviolet light having wavelengths in the range of from about 300-400 nm. Light of other wavelengths, such as in the visible range, pass through (that is, are transmitted by) the films. It is at these ultraviolet wavelengths to which the intensity of reflection is referring.Fig. 1 is a schematic cross section of a two component multilayer ultraviolet reflecting film of the present invention, the film including protective skin layers on both exterior surfaces thereof; 

 Fig.2 is a perspective and somewhat schematic representation of a solar detoxification reflector system; andFig.3 is a graph of wavelength versus predicted reflectance for multilayer films fabricated in accordance with the present invention. The present invention provides improved
