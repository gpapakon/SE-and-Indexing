<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an artificial hip acetabular cup for anchorage in the acetabulum of the human pelvis. Anchorage is effected with a curable bone cement or by means of screws penetrating the external part of the acetabular cup. The external surface comprises concentric grooves which extend at least partially around the periphery and which extend, according to the invention, inwardly at an acute angle and whose edges are particularly advantageously designed as sharp-edged cutting edges.

Artificial hip acetabular cup (1) for anchoring in the acetabulum of the human pelvic
girdle, wherein the anchoring is effected by means of a hardenable bone cement or by

means of screws passing through the outer surface (2) of the hip acetabular cup (1), with
at least partially encircling concentric grooves (4) at the outer surface (2), wherein these

grooves (4) are each formed in cross-section by two at least approximately planar flanks
(4.1, 4.2), wherein the grooves (4) extend away from the outer surface (2) and into the

interior, wherein similarly concentric regions of the spherical outer surface (2) are left
between the concentric grooves (4), wherein each time at least one of the flanks (4.1, 4.2)

has an angle of inclination deviating from the horizontal or the vertical, so that the cross-section
of the grooves (4), i.e. the spacing of the flanks (4.1, 4.2) from one another,

continuously reduces, and wherein the flanks (4.1, 4.2) converge in the interior of the hip
acetabular cup (1) at an acute angle up to a similarly acute-angled apex (4.3),

characterised in that the acute-angled apex (4.3) is directed towards the side of the hip
acetabular cup (1) remote from the pole and that additional transverse grooves (7) are

provided, which extend in the manner of meridians away from the pole (6) with a cross-section
continuously reducing away from the pole (6).
