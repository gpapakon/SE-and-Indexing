<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for sealing off an open long bone, a bone foramen, an osteotomy surface, a bone fenestra or a fracture gap. The seal proposed is an elastic membrane (10) which is placed over the end of the bone and/or pressed against the bone, preferably so that a vacuum can be produced inside the bone.

<CLAIMS>
A device (10) for sealing an opened tubular bone, a bone
opening, an osteotomy area, a bone window or a fracture

fissure, characterized by an elastic membrane in form of a
hollow cylinder including an open end and a closed end, with

swellings (12, 14) and/or enlargements for sealing of
profiles, recesses, cavities and/or openings, wherein said

elastic membrane is as vacuum-tight to build up a vacuum
within a bone after putting said device over a bone and/or

after pressing said device to a bone.
The device of claim 1, wherein the free edge of said
membrane includes a swelling and/or is enlarged.
The device of claim 1, wherein said elastic membrane
includes nominal fissures, nominal perforations and/or

openings.
The device of claims 1-3, wherein said elastic membrane is
made of silicone.
The device of claims 1-4, wherein said elastic membrane
may be sealed at its free edge by means of a drawing device.
The device of claims 1-5, wherein said drawing device is
elastic and tensile.
The device of claims 1-6, wherein said drawing device is
being guided or fixed. 
The device of claims 1-7, wherein said membrane includes
tags (34a, 34b), which are formed to be adapted to be

sealingly tied about the circumference of the bone.
The device of claim 1-8, wherein said free edge of said
elastic membrane is formed to be inflatable for example like a

tube or swelling with a gas or a liquid, and wherein said bone
being sealed by such action.
A set of devices according to claims 1-9 provided in
different sizes to seal bone openings of different sizes.
The device of claims 1-10 in combination with a device for
sealing a bone cavity or a seal.
