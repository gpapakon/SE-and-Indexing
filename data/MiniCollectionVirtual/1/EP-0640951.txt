<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a multiple-layer building element, which acts in a sound-damping manner, a soft porous layer which is joined on one side to an essentially rigid carrier layer or is arranged on one such and is covered on the other side with a thin covering layer, consists essentially of foam material; it has a system of chambers (4) which are designed and arranged such that sound waves can enter into the chamber through entry openings (5) to the chambers through the thin covering layer (3) covering the entry openings, and the chamber walls, as a result of resonance, significantly reduce the sound wave energy in conjunction with the sound-absorbing effect of the soft porous layer (2).

<CLAIMS>
A multi-layered sound-insulating and sound-absorbing structural
component comprising a substantially rigid carrier layer

(1), a plastic layer constituting a system of chambers (4),
whose chambers (4) are configured as resonance or, respectively,

Helmholtz chambers having different resonance frequencies
and open over access openings (5) for incident sound

waves, and a cover layer (3) covering the side facing away from
the carrier layer (1),
characterised in

that the plastic layer of the chamber system is configured as a
porous soft layer (2) in such a manner that the chamber walls

contribute, in combination with the sound-absorbing action of
the porous soft layer (2), to the reduction of sound wave energy,

and that the access openings (5) are covered by the cover
layer(3), said cover layer being configured to be film-like or

membrane-like thin.
Component according to claim 1,
characterised in

that the thickness as well as the material for the soft layer
(2) and/or the carrier layer (1) are configured such that the

soft layer (2) destroys sound wave energy and the carrier layer
(1) insulates sound. 
Component according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in

that an intermediate layer (2b) separating the chambers (4)
from the carrier layer (1) is inserted between the soft layer

(2) and the carrier layer (1).
Component according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in

that the carrier layer (1) consists of a heavy layer.
Component according to claim 4,
characterised in

that the carrier layer (1) consists of PU foam strongly filled
with heavy fillers like heavy spar.
Component according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in

the carrier layer (1) consists of glass-mat reinforced thermoplastic
plastic.
Component according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in

that the soft layer (2) is connected with the carrier layer (1)
via such connecting elements (7) which permit a separation of

the connected layers.
Component according to claim 7,
characterised in

that the connecting elements (7) consist of such an adhesive

layer which may be detached by thermal treatment.
Component according to claim 7,
characterised in

that the connecting elements (7a) are detachably disposed in
edge regions (1a) of the carrier layer (1). 
Component according to claim 7,
characterised in

that a plurality of connecting elements (7) are distributed, at
a mutual spacing and in a spot-like manner, over the contact

region of the soft layer (2) and the carrier layer (1).
