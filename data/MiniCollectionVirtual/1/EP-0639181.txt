<ABSTRACT>
Compounds having formula (I) are antagonists of the actions of leukotrienes. These compounds are useful as anti-asthmatic, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective agents. They are also useful in treating angina, cerebral spasm, glomerular nephritis, hepatitis, endotoxemia, uveitis, and allograft rejection.

<DESCRIPTION>
V r- 1 -10PYRIDINE-SUBSTITUTED BENZYL ALCOHOLS AS LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION15 The leukotrienes constitute a group of locally acting hormones, produced in living systems from arachidonic acid. The major leukotrienes are Leukotriene B4 (abbreviated at LTB4), LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. The biosynthesis of these leukotrienes begins20 with the action of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase on arachidonic acid to produce the epoxide known as Leukotriene A4 (LTA4), which is converted to the other leukotrienes by subsequent enzymatic steps. Further details of the biosynthesis, as well as the25 metabolism of the leukotrienes, are to be found in the book Leukotrienes and Lipoxygenases. ed. J. Rokach, Elsevier, Amsterdam (1989). The actions of the leukotrienes in living systems and their contribution to various diseases states are also discussed in the book by Rokach.

 U.S. Patent 5,004,743 discloses structures of leukotriene antagonists which differ from the present compounds, most notably in the absence of the benzyl alcohol and of fused cycloalkyl pyridines. The structure of the compounds disclosed in the above patent application is shown below.The art also describes certain quinoline- containiήg compounds as having leukotriene antagonist activity. Thus, EP 318,093 (Merck) describes compounds of structure A while compounds of structure B are disclosed in W0 89/12629 (Rorer).

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to pyridine-substituted benzyl alcohols having activity as leukotriene antagonists, to methods for their preparation, and to methods and pharmaceutical formulations for using these compounds in mammals(especially humans).Because of their activity as leukotriene antagonists, the compounds of the present invention are useful as anti-asthmatic, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective agents. They are also useful in treating angina, cerebral spasm, glomerular nephritis, hepatitis, endotoxemia, uveitis, and allograft rejection.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe compounds of this invention are best realized by Formula I :wherein:R1 is H, halogen, CN, lower alkyl, cyloalkyl, polyhalo lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxy lower alkyl, lower alkylthio lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, pyridyl, thiazolyl,SUBSTITUTE SHEET
