<ABSTRACT>
A shield 42 for restricting molten corium from flowing into a water sump 36 
disposed in a floor 38 of a containment vessel 12 includes upper and lower walls 44, 46 

which extend vertically upwardly and downwardly from the floor 38 for laterally bounding 
the sump 36. The upper wall 44 includes a plurality of laterally spaced apart flow channels 

48 extending horizontally therethrough, with each channel 48 having a bottom 48a 
disposed coextensively with the floor 38 for channeling water therefrom into the sump 36. 

Each channel 48 has a height and a length predeterminedly selected for allowing heat from 
the molten corium to dissipate through the upper and lower walls 44, 46 as it flows 

therethrough for solidifying the molten corium therein to prevent accumulation thereof in 
the sump 36.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to nuclear reactors, and, more specifically, 
to a shield for restricting molten corium from flowing into water sumps in a lower drywell 
below a reactor pressure vessel. An exemplary nuclear reactor, such as a boiling water reactor (BWR), includes a 
reactor core disposed in a reactor pressure vessel, with the pressure vessel being in turn 
disposed in a containment vessel. The reactor core includes a plurality of nuclear fuel rods 
configured in bundles to generate heat which is transferred to water recirculating therein 
for generating steam to power a steam turbine-generator, for example. Reactivity in the core is typically controlled by a plurality of control rods typically 
extending vertically upwardly therein from the bottom of the pressure vessel. Conventional 
control rod drives (CRDs) are mounted below the pressure vessel in a lower drywell region 
of the containment vessel for selectively inserting the control rods into the core and 
withdrawing the control rods therefrom for controlling reactivity. The lower drywell is 
defined by an annular pedestal wall which is used to support the pressure vessel. The containment vessel is typically a concrete structure having an inner steel liner 
designed for containing the expected elevated pressure therein in the event of a nuclear 
accident, as well as preventing significant nuclear radiation released therefrom. The lower 
drywell being disposed below the pressure vessel typically includes one or more water 
sumps for collecting leaking water which is then conventionally removed therefrom by 
pumps. In the event of a severe accident in which the reactor core melts to form hot. 
molten core debris known as corium, the corium must be suitably contained within the 
containment vessel without appreciably damaging the containment vessel or the reactor 
pedestal. As the molten debris spreads over the floors of the containment vessel, the flow 
thereof will be fairly uniform in thickness if there are no obstructions and the floors are  
 
uniformly level. In this way, the molten corium may be allowed to uniformly cool and 
solidify. Since the molten corium includes molten reactor fuel which generates heat even 
after the reactor is shutdown, it may reliquify if suitable cooling thereof is not maintained. For example, requirements for an advanced light water reactor include providing a 
suitable floor area beneath the pressure vessel for limiting the thickness of molten corium 
following an accident to promote the

A shield (42) for restricting molten corium (40) releasable from 
a nuclear reactor core (26) disposed in a reactor pressure vessel (14) inside 

a containment vessel (12) from flowing into a water sump (36) disposed in 
a floor (38) of the containment vessel (12) below the pressure vessel (14) 

comprising: 

an upper wall (44) extending vertically upwardly from said 
floor (38) and laterally bounding said sump (36) for blocking fluid flow into 

said sump (36) from said floor (38); 
a lower wall (46) extending vertically downwardly from said floor 
(38) and coextensively with said upper wall (44), and laterally bounding said 

sump (36); and 
said upper wall (44) having a plurality of laterally spaced apart 
flow channels (48) extending horizontally therethrough, each channel (48) 

having a bottom (48a) disposed coextensively with said floor (38) for 
channeling water therefrom through said upper wall (44) into said sump 

(36), and each channel (48) having a height and a length predeterminedly 
selected for allowing heat from said molten corium (40) to dissipate through 

said upper and lower walls (44, 46) upon flow therethrough for solidifying 
said molten corium (40) therein, said upper wall (44) having a height from 

said floor (38) and a thickness selected to limit thermal insulation above 
said channels (48) to prevent reliquification of said corium solidified in said 

channels (48), and said lower wall (46) having a depth below said floor (38) 
and a thickness selected to limit thermal insulation below said channels 

(48) to prevent reliquification of said corium solidified in said channels (48).

and lower walls (44, 46) are formed of a material having a melting 

temperature greater than a predetermined interface temperature between 
said molten corium (40) and said walls (44, 46).  

 
A corium shield (42) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
upper and lower walls (44, 46) are configured as interlayered bricks. 
A corium shield (42) according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

sed on said upper wall 44 and above 
said sump (36) for preventing flow of said molten corium therethrough into 

said sump (36). 
A corium shield (42) according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
further comprising a liner (52) covering each of said channels (48) for 

preventing direct contact of said molten corium therewith, said liner (52)
