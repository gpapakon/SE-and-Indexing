<ABSTRACT>
The synchronisation method is applied to synchronise the decoder in the radio data signal receiver with the received data stream. A counter, with a count value having a random relation to the block sequence of the data current, is indexed by the radio data signal data clock and is reset upon reaching a count corresponding to the number of bits in a group. After reception of each bit sequence for a valid data block, the actual count value is compared with the block type in a table, synchronisation being indicated when a given number of corresponding count values and block types are located.

Method for synchronization of an RDS decoder in
a broadcast radio receiver to the RDS datastream which

is received by this receiver, characterized in that

a) a counter which is incremented by the RDS data
clock and whose count is randomly related to the block

sequence of the RDS datastream is in each case reset on
reaching a count which corresponds to the number of

bits in any group;
b) on reception of each bit sequence which forms a
valid data block, the current count of the counter is

stored with the block type (24b) in a block table (24);
c) a check is carried out to determine which combinations
of count and block type (24b) stored in the block

table can be combined with one another; and
d) the synchronization is regarded as having been
achieved when a predetermined number of combinations of

count and block type (24b) which are combined with one
another is found.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that two combinations of count and block type (24b) are

regarded as being combinable with one another if the
block type (24b) for the same count matches.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that two combinations of count and block type (24b) are

regarded as being combinable with one another when,
with a block type (24b) that is not the same, the count

is offset by a number of increments which corresponds
to the number of bits by which two data blocks of the 

two different block types are offset in the RDS datastream.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, in addition to the count

and the block type (24b), the data content (24a) of
each valid data block is stored in the block table.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the counter comprises a

block-phase counter (18) and a group-phase counter
(20), in that the counting range of the block-phase

counter is governed by the number of bits in one block
of the RDS datastream, and in that, when the block-phase

counter overflows, the group-phase counter is
incremented and has a counting range which is governed

by the number of blocks in one group in the RDS data-stream.
