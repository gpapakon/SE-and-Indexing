<ABSTRACT>
The exhaust catalytic converter (1) with an ordered support structure (10) for the catalytic material has layers (13) with passages arranged in parallel. The layers are aligned essentially parallel to the main direction of flow (15) of the exhaust gas. According to the invention the cross-sectional areas of the support structure along the main direction of flow have an at least partially variable area and/or variable form; the passages enclose an angle of between approximately 10 DEG  and 70 DEG  with the main direction of flow and the passages of adjacent layers are open to one another and cross one another. The catalytic converter according to the invention allows its form to be adapted to confined spaces.

Catalytic converter (1) for exhaust gas comprising 
an ordered supporting structure (10) for the catalytic 

material, wherein the support structure is divided along 
the direction (15) of main flow of the exhaust gas in at 

least two segments (SH, SV) and every segment includes 
layers (13) with channels arranged in parallel, the 

layers being substantially parallel to the direction of 
main flow, the channels making with the direction of main 

flow an angle between about 10° and 70°, the channels of 
adjacent layers being open towards each other and 

crossing each other, and the layers of adjacent segments 
having different orientation, characterised in that the 

cross-sectional areas of the support structure having 
along the direction of main flow at least partly variable 

area and/or shape. 
Catalytic converter according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the layers of adjacent segments 

have an orientation displaced with respect to each other 
through 90°. 
Catalytic converter according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the layers are formed at least 

partly by metallic, foil-type material which is 
corrugated or folded in a zigzag fashion. 
Catalytic converter according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the foil-type material contains 

openings. 
Catalytic converter according to claim 4, 
characterised in that, as a consequence of the openings, 

the supporting structure forms a vortex packing.  
 
Catalytic converter according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the supporting structure is made at 

least partly of an extruded ceramic material. 
Catalytic converter according to any one of claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the walls of the supporting 

structure have fine structuring as a consequence of which 
increase of the specific surface is obtained with regard 

to the catalytic activity. 
Catalytic converter according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the surface structuring is in the 

form of a washcoat. 
Use of a catalytic converter according to any one of 
claims 1 to 8 for the decomposition of pollutants from 

exhaust gas emitted by cars. 
Use of a catalytic converter according to any one of 
claims 1 to 8 as a stationary catalytic afterburning 

apparatus.
