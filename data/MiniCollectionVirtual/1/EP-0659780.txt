<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acrylamide polymers
and aqueous solutions thereof, which are useful, e.g.
in the papermaking industry, in the field of effluent
treatment, and in the field of civil engineering and
construction. Specifically, the present invention is
concerned with acrylamide polymers having a controlled
branched and crosslinked structure. The acrylamide
polymers according to the present invention are
particularly useful in the field of the papermaking
industry as paper strengthening agents excellent in
paper reinforcing effects.Acrylamide polymers have been used for various
applications to date. Specifically, paper strength
agents, drainage agents, retention aids, coagulants,
secondary oil recovering agents, and dispersants. In
these applications, various acrylamide polymers whose
weight average molecular weights range from about
100,000 to somewhat greater than 20,000,000 are chosen
depending on the application purposes, and those having
a linear molecular structure have been used primarily. In recent years, it has been attempted to improve
the performance of acrylamide polymers in the field of
papermaking industry, such as paper strength agents, by
allowing them to have a partially-crosslinked structure
and a partially-branched structure so that their
molecular weights can be increased while suppressing a
viscosity increase in their solutions.There is, for example, a technique in which a
vinyl monomer having two or more double bonds in a
molecule is used as a crosslinking agent. Specific
known examples of the vinyl monomer include divinyl
monomers such as methylenebisacrylamide, methylenebismethacrylamide,
ethylene glycol diacrylate and ethylene
glycol dimethacrylate; and trifunctional monomers such
as 1,3,5-triacryloylhexahydro-S-triazine and triallyl
isocyanurate. The molecular weight increasing technique,
which relies upon these vinyl monomers alone, is
however still considered to be insufficient for paper
strength agents, because it results in a branched and
crosslinked structure substantially lacking uniformity
and moreover, increased gelling effects are
observed when polyfunctional monomers are used.It has also been attempted to produce an
acrylamide polymer having a branched and crosslinked
structure by using a specific compound in combination 
with such a crosslinking agent. Known combinations include,
for example, the combinations of crosslinking
agents and primary amines or OH-containing monomers,
the combinations of crosslinking agents and specific
hydrophobic monomers, and the
