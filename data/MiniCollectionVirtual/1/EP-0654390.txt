<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an initialisation beacon for a vehicle at rest, in particular for a system giving assistance in driving, in operation and in maintenance, constituted by a superposition of structures with cross-members Si, each structure with cross-members being constituted by a first electrical cable Ci1 and a second electrical cable Ci2, these being parallel to each other over a major part of their length, the first electrical cable Ci1 crossing over the second electrical cable Ci2 so as to form a succession of magnetic nodes N; characterised in that:   - the magnetic nodes Nij of a given structure with cross-members Si are distributed, with a spatial period, along the said structure with cross-members; and - the said structures with cross-members Si are supplied successively per pair Pmn and successively at a clock frequency FH and at a data frequency FD.

An initialization beacon for initializing a stationary vehicle, in 
particular for a system for assisting driving, operation, and 

maintenance, the beacon being constituted by superposed cross-over 
structures (Si), each cross-over structure being constituted by a 

first electrical cable (Ci1) and a second electrical cable (Ci2), 
which cables are mutually parallel over most of their length, the 

first electrical cable (Ci1) crossing over the second electrical 
cable (Ci2) so as to form a succession of magnetic nodes (Nij); in 

which the magnetic nodes (Nij) of any given cross-over structure (Si) 
are distributed, in compliance with a space period, along said cross-over 

structure; said beacon being characterized in that:
 
   the initialization beacon is an initialization beacon of a 

stationary vehicle, and in that it includes means (9, 10, 11, 12) for 
powering said cross-over structures (Si) successively in pairs (Pmn), 

and successively at a clock frequency (FH) and at a data frequency 
(FD). 
An initialization beacon according to claim 1, in which beacon 
said pairs (Pmn) of cross-over structures are composed of a first 

cross-over structure (Sm) and of a second cross-over structure (Sn) 
offset relative to the first cross-over structure (Sm) by one half of 

the space period between two successive magnetic nodes (Nij) of the 
same cross-over structure (Si). 
An initialization beacon according to claim 1 or 2, in which 
beacon a binary 1 is transmitted by applying the following to said 

cross-over structures (Sm, Sn) composing a given pair (Pmn) of cross-over 
structures: 


a clock signal at clock frequency (FH) successively to the 
first cross-over structure (Sm), to the second cross-over structure 

(Sn), and to the first cross-over structure (Sm); then 
a data signal at data frequency (FD) successively to the first 
cross-over structure (Sm), to the second cross-over structure (Sn), 

and to the first cross-over structure (Sm); and  
 
a clock signal at clock frequency (FH) successively to the 
first cross-over structure (Sm), to the second cross-over structure 

(Sn), and to the first cross-over structure (Sm). 
An initialization beacon according to claim 1 or 2, in which 
beacon a binary 0 is transmitted by applying the following to said 

cross-over structures (Sm, Sn) composing a given pair (Pmn) of crossover 
structures: 


a clock signal at clock frequency (FH) successively to the 
first cross-over structure (Sm), to the second cross-over structure 

(Sn), and to the first cross-over structure (Sm); then 
a data signal at data frequency (FD) to the first cross-over 
structure (Sm); and 
a clock signal at clock frequency (FH) successively to the 
first cross-over structure (Sm), to the second cross-over structure 

(Sn), and to the first cross-over structure (Sm). 
An initialization beacon according to claim 1, in which beacon 
virtual cross-over structures (S'
l
) are generated by powering a first 
real cross-over structure (S
l
-1) and a second cross-over structure 
(S
l
+1). 
An initialization beacon according to claim 5, in which beacon 
said real cross-over structures Si are powered successively in double 

pairs and successively at a clock frequency (FH) and at a data 
frequency (FD). 
An initialization beacon according to claim 6, in which beacon a 
binary 1 is transmitted by simulating a first clock signal followed 

by a data signal followed by a second clock signal at the virtual 
nodes (N'21) of a virtual pair (P'26) of virtual cross-over 

structures. 
An initialization beacon according to claim 6, in which beacon a 
binary 0 is transmitted by simulating a first clock signal followed 

by a second clock signal at the virtual nodes (N'21) of a virtual  
 

pair (P'26) of virtual cross-over structures, without a data signal 
appearing between said clock signals. 
An initialization beacon according to any one of claims 3, 4, 7, 
or 8, in which beacon a loop (B) passes the clock signal at the clock 

frequency (FH) when one of the two cross-over structures (Sm, Sn) of 
the pair (Pmn) of cross-over structures passes the data signal, and 

said loop passes the data signal at the data frequency (FD) when one 
of the two cross-over structures (Sm, Sn) of the pair (Pmn) of cross-over 

structures passes the clock signal.
