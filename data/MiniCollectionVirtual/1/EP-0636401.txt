<ABSTRACT>
Process water recycling plant, in particular for a damping solution and other process waters from printing machines. Process water is taken from a process water unit (B1), independently of its connection to the printing machine, and separated into filtrate and concentrate in an ultrafiltration filter (F2). The filtrate is recirculated via a process water recirculation line (22) into the process water unit B1. The concentrate is recirculated via a fluid line (18) a plurality of times into a working vessel (B3), through which the process water is also passed on its way from the process water unit (B1) to the ultrafiltration filter (F2). After reaching a certain concentration, the concentrate is taken from this filter circuit, chemically worked up, and separated into a solid phase to be removed and a liquid phase recirculated into the filter circuit. Since the recycling process operates separately from the process water feed to the printing machine, interference with one another is ruled out.

Process water recycling process, especially for process water from 
printing presses, such as in particular fountain water or wash water, 

consisting of the following process stages: 

1.1 continuous or intermittent removal of some of the process water from 
the process water system of the press in question and the supply of 

the removed part of the process water to an ultra-fine filtering device; 
1.2 separation of the process water removed through the ultra-fine 
filtering device into filtrate and concentrate such that the filtrate 

contains essentially only all the desirable constituents and the  
 

concentrate contains essentially all the undesirable constituents of the 
process water and, where desirable or not avoidable, a proportion of 

the desirable constituents of the process water;
 
characterised by 
1.3 the return of the filtrate to the process water system in the press; 
1.4 the return of the concentrate from the ultra-fine filtering device in the 
process water circuit, which leads from the process water system to 

the ultra-fine filtering device and the supply of the recycled 
concentrate together with the process water to the ultra-fine filtering 

device, whereby this recirculation of concentrate and a proportion of 
the process water through the ultra-fine filtering device can be 

repeated several times; 
1.5 the transfer of concentrate, when a predetermined quantity or density 
of concentrate has been produced, from the concentrate recirculation 

circuit to a disintegration system; 
1.6 the separation of the concentrate in the disintegration system by 
adding chemical disintegrants to a solid phase and a liquid clear 

phase; 
1.7 the return of the liquid clear phase to the process water circuit which 
leads from the process water system to the ultra-fine filtering device; 
1.8 the segregation of the solid phase from the process once a set 
quantity of solids has been obtained. 
Process water recycling method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
before the concentrate is transferred as described in process stage 1.5, it is 

forced back, by means of compressed air, out of the ultra-fine filtering device 
into an operating tank which is located in the process water circuit from the 

process water system to the ultra-fine filtering device, and that the 
concentrate is then delivered, as described in process stage 1.5, from this 

operating tank to the disintegration system.

the ultra-fine filtering device is flushed in turn with water and compressed air. 
Process water recycling plant, especially for the process water from printing

broken up into filtrate and concentrate as a result of a sieve effect, without 

the need for chemical reagents, of which the filtrate mainly contains only

mainly all the undesirable constituents of the process water and, if 

desirable or unavoidable, a proportion of the desirable constituents of the
