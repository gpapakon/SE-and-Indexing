<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for storing clipping, masking or stenciling 
plane data in an unused or residual portion of a frame buffer used with 

a graphics display. The clipping plane data corresponding to the pixels 
in the displayed portion of the frame buffer are effectively and 

efficiently stored through a folding type conversion of addresses. High 
speed address conversion for both rendering and accessing of clipping 

data is performed by hardware logic devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the storage and 
retrieval of data during the computer generation of graphics images on a 
video display screen. More particularly, the invention is directed to a 
system and method for efficiently generating, storing and retrieving 
clipping, masking or stenciling plane data used in conjunction with 
video display images rendered into a frame buffer. The rendering, storage and eventual display of graphics images 
defined by computer systems is an area of technology undergoing much 
competition and evolution. Presently preferred systems used to generate 
high resolution and color range graphics images, including those 
involving animation and video reproduction, use high speed raster 
engines to convert primitives defined by central processors into color 
images stored as binary data in a video frequency random access memory 
known as a frame buffer. The data in the frame buffer is stored in a 
raster format corresponding to the video display, with the depth of the 
frame buffer, defined by bit planes, corresponding to the color 
resolution. The frame buffer is scanned in synchronism with the video 
display screen to generate the final image. High performance work 
stations also typically include additional bit planes, corresponding in 
size to the frame buffer, for storing windows data and data for other 
general masking or clipping applications. (Such applications or 
functions produce data variously referred to as windowing, clipping, 
stenciling, masking, overlay or underlay data - and referred to 
generally hereafter as clipping data). As the pixel resolution of high 
grade video displays increases, presently typically being 1024x768, so 
too does the size of the frame buffer. Unfortunately, frame buffers use 
expensive VRAM chips, a cost which is further magnified for systems 
using double buffering. Configurations of VRAM chips normally create frame buffers having 
fixed addressable ranges incremented in powers of 2, while video display 
screens are not so proportioned. Therefore, unused or residual portions  
 
of frame buffer memory typically remain. In the context of the 1024x768 
pixel count graphics display screen, the typical frame buffer is 
1024x1024 in size. Therefore, the frame buffer contains an unused or 
residual addressable memory space of 1024x256. The depth of the residual memory corresponds to the number of the 
bit planes in the used portion of the frame buffer. For a graphics 
display having a 256 color range, the frame buffer is
