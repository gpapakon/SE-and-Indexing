<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, there is provided 
a self-commutated static var compensator for stabilizing 

a power system (1) by controlling an output of 
a self-commutated converter (3) for receiving/supplying 

power from/to the power system (1). A constant system 
voltage maintaining controller (14) calculates a first 

target value signal of the reactive current in accordance 
with a difference between a reference voltage and 

a voltage detected by a voltage detector (8, 11), and a 
reactive current controller (26) generates a second target 

value signal of the reactive current (3) in accordance 
with a difference between the first target value 

signal of the reactive current and a detected current. 
A converter controller (27) applies a gate driving pulse 

to the self-commutated converter (3) in response to the 
second target value signal of the reactive current and 

second target value signal of the active current. A 
loss reduction circuit (19) stops the gate driving pulse 

corresponding to the second target value of the reactive 
current from being supplied to the gate of the self-commutated 

converter (3) when reactive power output from 
the self-commutated converter (3) is close to zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reactive power
compensating apparatus for stabilizing a system voltage
of a power system and, more specifically, to a self-commutated
reactive power compensating apparatus capable
of reducing in switching loss in its steady state.A static var compensator is generally known as an
apparatus for stabilizing a system voltage of a power
system. In particular, a self-commutated static var
compensator (referred to as a self-commutated SVC
hereinafter) is excellent in response characteristic and
has the advantage of operating quickly according to
variations in power system. The self-commutated SVC
varies an output voltage of a self-commutated converter
connected to the power system to regulate an amount of
reactive power, and then a system voltage. The self-commutated
converter generally includes a self-turnoff
switching device and a DC (direct current) capacitor for
establishing a back power.FIG. 5 is a view showing a loss of a conventional
self-commutated SVC. As shown in this figure, the loss
is maximized (point B) at both the maximum points QCmax
and QLmax of the reactive power output therefrom, but
the loss occurs even when the reactive power is zero
(point A). The loss occurring when the reactive power
is zero is attributed to a switching operation of 
a self-commutated converter.There are many cases where a voltage reactive power
controller (VQC) for making a system power constant by
opening/closing a power capacitor or a shunt reactor is
installed in a substation. It was therefore expected
that the reactive power output from the self-commutated
SVC in the steady state operation would become substantially
zero. Since, however, the conventional self-commutated
SVC is always controlled so that the output
voltage of the self-commutated converter coincides with
the system voltage even in the steady state operation,
even if the reactive power output from the self-commutated
SVC is substantially zero, the switching
operation of the self-commutated converter is repeated,
resulting in a switching loss.US-A-4.353,024 discloses a var compensator comprising
the features of lines 1 to 14 and 18 to 25 of claim 1.
Furthermore, this prior art teaches to decrease losses
by stopping the control pulses supplied to the control
terminal of the switching device when a reactive power
output from the converter is close to zero.The object of the invention is
to provide another self-commutated SVC which eliminates a loss
due to a switching operation of a self-commutated converter
when a
