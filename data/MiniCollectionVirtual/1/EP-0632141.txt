<ABSTRACT>
A surface treated steel sheet comprises : a steel sheet 
containing C, Si, Mn, P, S, Ni, Ti, Cu and B; a diffused alloy 

layer containing Fe, Ni, and P; and a zinc coating layer formed 
on the diffused alloy layer. 
A method for producing a surface treated steel sheet 
comprises the steps of: preparing a steel sheet; coating the 

steel sheet with a Ni-P coating layer; heat-treating the steel 
sheet coated with the Ni-P coating layer; and forming a zinc 

coating layer on the diffused alloy layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface treated steel
sheet having excellent corrosion resistance and being suitable
for a steel sheet used for automobiles, building materials,
electric equipment, and other applications, and relates to a
method for producing thereof.Cold-rolled steel sheets and other steel sheets used in
automobiles have been reducing their sheet thickness aiming at
the reduction of car-body weight and the reduction of
production cost. The reduction of sheet thickness, however,
reduces the net thickness after corrosion, which induces a
problem of insufficient strength of the car-body after
corroded. One of the most simple means to improve the corrosion
resistance of automobile steel sheet is the increase of coating
weight of zinc. The means, however, results in the increase of
cost, and also induces a problem of separation of coating layer
during the steel sheet working to expose the steel base
material which is vulnerable to corrosion. In addition, the
coating weight gives a significant effect to the spot welding 
which is widely employed in assembling automobile parts. In
concrete terms, the increase of coating weight enhances the
degradation of weldability. The steel sheets used in
automobiles are requested to have a good formability such as
deep drawing capability, as well as low cost. Responding to
that kind of requirements, various types of steel sheets have
been introduced, but none has fully satisfied those
requirements.For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication
(hereinafter referred to simply as "JP-A-") No. 3-253541
discloses that a steel of Cu-P system with reduced C, adding
slight amount of S, and adding a specified amount of Si and Ti
exhibits excellent corrosion resistance under an environment of
repeated dry and wet cycle. JP-A-3-150315 discloses a method
for producing steel sheet using a Cu-P system with reduced C
and adding slight amount of Ni to give excellent corrosion
resistance and formability. JP-A-4-141554 discloses a cold-rolled
steel sheet having excellent corrosion resistance and
having a high strength and a method for producing the steel
sheet. JP-A-4-168246 discloses a cold-rolled steel sheet
containing P, Ti, Nb, etc. and having excellent formability and
corrosion resistance.However, the steel sheet disclosed in JP-A-3-253541 is a Ti-killed
steel, and the steel tends to generate surface defects
and tends to induce nozzle plugging during the slab production
in a continuous casting line. The method disclosed in JP-A-3-150315
specifies the use of
