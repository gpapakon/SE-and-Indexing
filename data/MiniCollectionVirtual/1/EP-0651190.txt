<ABSTRACT>
A fluid flow control valve comprising a flow passage 
(1a), a valve seat (1c) in the passage selectively 

openable by a valve member, a rotatable stem (9) 
controlling the valve means by moving longitudinally in 

response to rotation within a bonnet (3) and a handle 
(12) for rotating the stem, the handle being lockable 

against the bonnet (3) to prevent rotationand thus set 
the flow rate, characterised in that the handle (12) 

comprises a main part (12') fixed to the stem (9) and a 
locking part (12'') coupled to the main part so as to 

allow relative movement in a direction laterally of the 
stem longitudinal axis the locking part (12'') including 

a locking screw (14) movable to act against the bonnet 
(3) to prevent rotation of the handle (6) thus setting 

a rate of flow through the valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved flow rate 
control valve for use in fluid ducts mainly in 
semiconductor manufacturing apparatus and nuclear power 
generation plant, and more particularly to a diaphragm 
type flow control valve capable of finely adjusting the 
flow rate. Generally the control valve for high purity gas used in 
semiconductor manufacturing apparatus or the like is 
severely required to possess particle-free and dead 
space-free characteristics. In the field of 
semiconductor manufacture, therefore, the diaphragm type 
control valves (especially direct touch type diaphragm 
valves) are widely used being structurally adapted to 
cope with the particle-free and dead space-free 
requirements. The diaphragm type control valve is, however, generally 
very small in the working stroke of diaphragm, and is not 
suited, by nature, to adjustment of flow rate or the 
like. In particular, it is extremely difficult to adjust 
finely the flow rate by manual operation. Accordingly, the applicant of the invention, to solve 
such problems, developed a diaphragm type control valve  
 
capable of adjusting the flow rate finely and accurately 
by manual operation, and disclosed it as the Japanese 
Patent Application JP-A-5-79570. Such control valve is composed of, as shown in Figure 5 
of the accompanying drawings, a body 30 possessing a 
fluid passage 30a, a valve seat 30c and a valve chamber 
30b, a diaphragm 31 contacting and separating from the 
valve seat 30c, a tubular cover or bonnet 33 with the 
lower end inserted into the valve chamber 30b to hold the 
peripheral edge of the diaphragm 31 air tightly through 
a holding adapter 32 and having a female thread part 33a 
in the upper inner circumference, a bonnet nut 34 for 
fixing the bonnet 33 to the body 30, a disc 36 
accommodated inward at the lower end of the bonnet 33 and 
having a diaphragm holder 35, a tubular slide stem 37 
elevatably inserted into the bonnet 33 above the disc 36 
in a rotation forbidden state and having in the inner 
circumference a female thread part 37a of a smaller 
thread pitch than the thread pitch of the female thread 
part 33a of the bonnet 33, a rotary stem 38 having both 
concentrically, at the inner side, a first male thread 
part 38a to be engaged with the female part 37a of the 
slide stem 37, and at the outer side, a second male 
thread part 38b to be engaged with the female thread part 
33a of the bonnet 33, thereby elevating and lowering the 
slide stem 37 by its rotation, a nearly tubular handle

<CLAIMS>
A fluid flow control valve comprising a flow passage 
(1a), a valve seat (1c) in the passage selectively 

openable by a valve member, a rotatable stem (9) 
controlling the valve means by moving longitudinally in 

response to rotation within a bonnet (3) and a handle 
(12) for rotating the stem, the handle being lockable 

against the bonnet (3) to prevent rotationan thus set the 
flow rate, characterised in that the handle (12) 

comprises a main part (12') fixed to the stem (9) and a 
locking part (12'') coupled to the main part so as to 

allow relative movement in a direction laterally of the 
stem longitudinal axis the locking part (12'') including 

a locking screw (14) movable to act against the bonnet 
(3) to prevent rotation of the handle thus setting a rate 

of flow through the valve. 
A valve according to Claim 1 wherein coupling of the 
handle main part (12') and the locking part (12'') is 

achieved by a coupling mechanism (13) composed of a pair 
of opposed guide holes (12a) at the lower end of the 

handle main body (12') in a direction orthogonal to the 
axial line of the handle (12), a pair of mounting holes 

(12b) pierced in the upper end of the lock handle (12'') 
and matching the guide holes (12a), and a pair of guide 

pins (22) interference-fitted to the mounting holes (12b)  
 

at one end and clearance-fitted to the guide holes (12a) 
at the other end. 
A valve according to Claim 2, wherein the guide pins 
(22) have one end clearance-fitted to the mounting holes 

(12b), and the other end interference-fitted to the guide 
holes (12a). 
A valve according to Claim 1, wherein coupling of 
the handle main part (12') and the locking part (12") is 

achieved by a coupling mechanism composed of a groove or 
engaging protrusion formed in a direction orthogonal to 

the axial line Y of the handle (12) at the lower end face 
of the handle main body (12') and an engaging protrusion 

or groove protrusion formed in a direction orthogonal to 
the axial line Y at the upper end face of the lock handle 

12" for engagement with the above-mentioned groove or 
engaging protrusion. 
A valve according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the flow control valve is a diaphragm type flow 

control valve designed to cause the diaphragm (2) to 
directly contact with or depart from the valve seat (1c) 

by means of an elevating motion of the stem (9). 
A valve according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein the stem (9) is a stem (9) which moves up and  

 
down by a distance corresponding to a difference 

betweentwo thread pitches for one revolution of the 
handle (12).
