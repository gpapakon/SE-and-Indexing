<ABSTRACT>
The press includes a rear limit stop (8) which can be adjusted in terms of height and horizontally, so that the limit-stop finger (9) can move vertically and horizontally. A clamp (10) is mounted in a removable manner at the end of the limit-stop finger (9) so as to permit gripping and manipulation of the workpiece (7) to be bent by the vertical and horizontal movement of the limit-stop finger (9). This clamp includes a V-shaped rear part (12) arranged so as to interact with a seat of corresponding shape made at the end of the limit-stop finger (9). Retention of the clamp (10) against its seat is provided by means of a flexible tie (14), fastened to a pneumatic cylinder (15), mounted inside the limit-stop finger (9). The clamp is arranged so as to enable the workpiece (7) to be gripped when the latter has been deposited on the workpiece-rest (5).
