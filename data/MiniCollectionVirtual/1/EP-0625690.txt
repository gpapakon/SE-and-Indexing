<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with Figure 1, in an integrated optical interferometer a light beam (5) is split up into two component bundles (0., 1.) by a coupling grating (2). One of the component bundles (1.) is launched into an optical fibre (1a) and fed to a further coupling grating (3). The second component bundle (0.) passes via a plane (flat) mirror (6) to the second coupling grating (3) and interferes there with the first component bundle (1.). The second coupling grating (3) is split up into component gratings (3a, 3b, 3c) which are phase-shifted relative to one another, with the result that mutually phase-shifted signals can be generated by detectors (7a, 7b, 7c).

Optoelectric position measuring device for measurement 
of the relative position of two objects, comprising a 

light source (4; 42; 43) emitting coherent light, at 
least one grating (2; 22; 63) for generation of at 

least two diffracted component beam bundles (0., 1.; 
0.2. 1.2; +1.3, -1.3) and at least one planar 

waveguide (1a; 1a2; 1a3), wherein in at least one 
plane the waveguide (1a; 1a2; 1a3) has at least two 

spatially separate gratings (2, 3; 22, 32; 23, 33), 
which are constructed as coupling gratings (2; 32; 23) 

in such a way that at least one of the component beam 
bundles (1.; 0.2; -1.3) is coupled into the waveguide 

by one of the coupling gratings (2; 32; 23) and is 
passed to a further coupling grating (3; 22; 33), and 

that a further bundle of the component beam bundles 
(0.; 1.2; +1.3) is additionally coupled into the 

waveguide (la; la2; la3) by the further coupling 
grating (3; 22; 33) and is brought to interference 

with the first component beam bundle (1.; 0.2; -1.3), 
characterised in that at least one of the coupling 

gratings (3; 33) consists of several sub-gratings (3a, 
3b, 3c; 33a, 33b, 33c), the grating structures of 

which are offset relative to one another in the 
grating plane in coupling direction so that the 

interfering component beam bundles (0., 1.; 0.2, 1.2; 
+1.3, -1.3) undergo a relative phase shift and are 

converted by detectors (7a, 7b, 7c; 72a, 72b, 72c; 
73a, 73b, 73c) allocated to the sub-gratings (3a, 3b, 

3c; 33a, 33b, 33c) into phase-shifted electrical 
signals. 
Position measuring device according to Claim 1,  
 

characterised in that the grating constants of the 
gratings (2, 3; 22, 32) are identical. 
Position measuring device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that grating constants of the 

gratings (23 and 33) are different. 
Position measuring device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that for modulation of the 

interfering component beam bundles, a plane mirror (6; 
62) is provided, the distance of which from the 

substrate (1, 12) is variable. 
Position measuring device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that for modulation of the 

interfering component beam bundles, a grating (63) is 
provided which is movable in a plane parallel to the 

substrate (13).

characterised in that the grating (63) is a reflection 

grating. 
Position measuring device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that a laser diode (4, 42, 43) acts 

as light source. 
Position measuring device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the detectors (7, 72, 73) are 

arranged adjacent to or on the coupling gratings (3, 
22, 33) or on the face sides of the substrate.
