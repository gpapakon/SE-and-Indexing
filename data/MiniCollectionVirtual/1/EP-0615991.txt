<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a blocked polyisocyanate 
which is the reaction product of a polyisocyanate 

with 

i) 60 to 99.9 equivalent percent, based on the equivalents of 
isocyanate groups of the polyisocyanate prior to blocking, 

of an oxime or lactam blocking agent for isocyanate groups 
and 
ii) 0.1 to 40 equivalent percent, based on the equivalents of 
isocyanate groups of the polyisocyanate prior to blocking, 

of hydrazine and/or a compound which is soluble in either 
the polyisocyanate, the blocking agent or an optional 

organic solvent for the polyisocyanate and contains the 

group, H(R)N-NR-CO-, wherein the carbonyl group is bound 
to carbon or nitrogen and R represents hydrogen or an 

optionally substituted hydrocarbon radical. 
The present invention also relates to a one-component 
coating composition containing this blocked polyisocyanate and 

a compound containing at least two isocyanate-reactive groups 
and to coated substrates prepared from this one-component 

coating composition which additionally contains an acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to one-component 
coating compositions containing oxime- or lactam-blocked 
polyisocyanates which have improved resistance to yellowing 
when they are used in the presence of melamine- and/or 
acid-containing coatings. There is a need in the automotive industry for 
topcoats which can be applied over existing basecoats and which 
provide improved properties when compared to conventional 
thermoset melamine/acrylics. Recently, two-component 
polyurethane coatings have increasingly been used as 
clearcoats. These coatings possess excellent environmental 
etch resistance as well as excellent appearance, durability, 
hardness and flexibility. The two-component polyurethane coating compositions 
suffer from one major disadvantage, i.e., they require 
two-component spray equipment as opposed to the thermoset 
melamine/acrylics which are applied using one-component 
equipment. Therefore, an additional capital expenditure is 
required to obtain the necessary spray equipment for applying 
the two-component polyurethane coating compositions. One possibility for providing a one-component 
polyurethane coating composition would be to convert the 
existing two-component polyurethane coating compositions by 
blocking the isocyanate groups of the polyisocyanate component. 
In this regard oxime-blocking agents are the preferred blocking 
agent because they possess storage stability in combination 
with a low unblocking temperature.  One of the difficulties of oxime- or lactam-blocked 
polyisocyanates is that when they come into contact with 
melamine resins or acids, they exhibit increased yellowing when 
compared to similar coatings which are not in contact with or 
blended with melamine resins or acids. The amount of yellowing 
increases as the curing temperature increases. Accordingly, 
blocking agents which require higher deblocking temperatures 
may suffer from increased yellowing due to the higher 
deblocking temperature. Such contact may occur when coating 
compositions containing oxime- or lactam-blocked polyisocyanates 
are applied as clearcoats over acid-containing 
and/or melamine-resin containing, thermoplastic or thermoset 
basecoats; when they are applied wet-on-wet as unicoats over 
acid-containing and/or melamine resin-containing primers; or 
when the coating compositions contain oxime- or lactam-blocked 
polyisocyanates in combination with acids and/or melamine 
resins. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide one-component polyurethane coating
