<ABSTRACT>
A gear testing machine (9) for evaluating the performance of a set of gears including a base support platform (16) that mounts a pinion (19) for movement in at least two mutually perpendicular axes, and permits fixing the pinion (19) in place. The gear (42) is then mounted relative to the pinion (19) through controllable actuators (52A-52C) attached to the frame (10) so that the gear support (42A) can be positioned at a desired location relative to the pinion spindle axis (26) to compensate for errors in mounting and to provide for very accurate mounting in accordance with specified parameters. The position of the gear carriage (46) can be changed during a testing sequence when the gears (42) are being run to observe changes in parameters on the gears.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gear testing,
and a way of mounting a first gear relative to a
second gear to provide six degrees of freedom for
positioning the first gear properly to obtain the
correct orientation relative to the second gear,and
maintaining or changing the orientation in real time.U.S. Patent 3,404,443 discloses a sag
compensator. The apparatus is designed to accommodate
various combinations of bevel and high point gears by
allowing a single linear adjustment. Specifically,
with the gears spinning, a vertical adjustment (Z)
compensates for any sag produced by the weight of the
gear and the means for holding it on the spindle.U.S. Patent 3,717,958 discloses an automated
lapping machine. The automatic lapping machine
provides a variety of lapping cycles in order to
"finish" the manufacture of a set of gears. The
machine uses linear actuators, each of which has a
ball screw unit driven by an independently controlled
step motor, to provide motion - effectively linear
motion.U.S. Patent 4,024,757, discloses a gear testing
machine for bevel and hyperboloidal gears. The
testing machine provides three manually operated
handwheels which allow adjustment of the machine bed
in three orthogonal axes.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided an apparatus for testing
and adjusting a position of a first gear with respect
to a second gear, the apparatus comprising:
a frame rotatably supporting the first gear;a carriage rotatably supporting the second gear
about a central axis of the second gear; actuator means comprising three actuators
substantially parallel to the central axis
of the second gear and spaced angularly
thereabout, and three actuators
substantially perpendicular to the central
axis of the second gear and spaced angularly
thereabout, the actuator means being
connected to the frame for supporting the
carriage relative to the first gear, the
actuator means moving the carriage so that
the second gear is linearly displaced along
three substantially orthogonal axes and
rotationally about at least one of the axes;and sensing means to determine relative
displacement of the second gear with respect
to the first gear.According to a second aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a method for testing the
running of a gear set comprising a first gear and a
second gear, the method comprising:
providing a frame for rotatably supporting the
first gear, a carriage for rotatably
supporting the second gear for rotation
