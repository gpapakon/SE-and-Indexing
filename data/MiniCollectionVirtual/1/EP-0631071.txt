<ABSTRACT>
An X-control mechanism (200) using an improved and easily installed 
pivot pin (100) is provided for providing a cylindrical pivot surface (16) about 

which a pivot arm (8) is able to pivot in response to movement of a control 
block (6) that is selectively engageable by a primary shaft (3) movable by an 

operator. The pivoting of arm (8) is operative to slide a control yoke (14) in an 
opposite direction along a fixedly secured control shaft (22) for selectively 

engaging mainshaft gears to a transmission mainshaft. Pivot pin (100) is 
operative to hold pivot arm (8) pivotable against the transmission housing (10) 

between an enlarged head (12) at one end and a snap ring (20) extending 
radially outwardly from an annular groove (18) adjacent the opposite end.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an X-control system for a change gear 
transmission and more particularly to a change gear transmission X-control 
system that utilizes an improved pivot pin for mounting a pivotable actuator arm 
of the mechanism to the transmission housing. Certain change gear transmissions have utilized X-control mechanisms for 
a number of years. In change gear transmission art, an X-control mechanism is 
a mechanism that reverses the direction of linear motion of a pair of spaced-apart 
members by means of a pivotable arm pivotably mounted therebetween 
such that when one of the members moves in one direction to engage the 
pivotable arm on one side of the pivot point, the arm on the opposite side of the 
pivot point pivots and engages the other member and moves it in opposite 
direction of movement of the first member. Such is of particular advantage in 
application to gear shaft patterns for it enables, one for example, to move a 
gear shift arm to a selected location in the shifting pattern which then, by 
means of the pivot arm, causes a clutching mechanism to move in an opposite 
direction to clutchingly engage a mainshaft gear to the transmission's mainshaft 
to provide a desired gear change ratio. Such X-control mechanisms are costly and complex and have heretofore 
employed a bolt having a threaded end and substantially cylindrical pivot surface 
along its shank about which the pivot arm pivots once mounted on the 
transmission housing. Generally, the bolt has been inserted through aligned openings through 
the pivot arm and transmission housing from inside the transmission housing  
 
such that the enlarged head of the bolt rests against the pivot arm inside the 
transmission housing with the threaded end of the bolt exposed in the outside 
of the transmission housing and onto which is threaded a nut washer 
combination for securing the bolt to the housing. The pivot surface has a larger 
diameter than the threaded end to provide an annular shoulder on the bolt 
facing towards the threaded end that engages the inside of the housing when 
the bolt shank is inserted through the opening through the pivot arm. The problems with the use of a nut/bolt combination is that, unless the 
nut is wired or otherwise secured, there is no assurance that the nut will not 
loosen over a period of time in addition to the assembly of the parts itself being 
difficult in having to hold the bolt steady while tightening the nut. The present invention eliminates the use of such prior art bolt

An improved pivot pin for mounting a pivotable actuator arm of an 
X-control mechanism to a change gear transmission housing, 

   said actuator arm engaged with an X-Control block on one side of the 
pivot pin that is movable in opposite directions upon corresponding movement 

of a primary shaft selectively engaged therewith, 
   said actuator arm engaged with a control yoke on the opposite side of the 

pivot pin having one end operatively connected to a mainshaft gear clutching 
mechanism and an opposite end slidably movable along an X-control shaft that 

is in substantial parallel alignment with the primary shaft, 
   said mechanism operative such that movement of the control block in one 

direction causes the actuator arm to pivot about the pivot pin and slide the 
control yoke in an opposite direction along the control shaft for effecting 

clutched engagement between the transmission mainshaft and the mainshaft 
gear by the clutching mechanism, and said improvement characterized by said 

pivot pin having a substantially cylindrical pivot surface disposed intermediate 
an enlarged head and an annular groove and operative to extend through aligned 

openings through the transmission housing and actuator arm with the pivot 
surface within the actuator arm opening with the actuator arm held in a 

pivotable condition against the transmission housing between the head of the 
pivot pin and a retaining ring extending radially outwardly from the groove. 
An X-control mechanism for a change gear transmission having an 
improved pivot pin for mounting a pivotable actuator arm of the mechanism to a 

housing of the transmission, said actuator arm engaged with an X-control block 
on one side of the pivot pin that is movable in opposite directions upon 

corresponding movement of a primary shaft selectively engaged therewith, 
   said actuator arm engaged with a control yoke on the opposite side of the 

pivot pin having one end operatively connected to a mainshaft gear clutching 
 

mechanism and an opposite end slidably movable along an X-control shaft that 
is in substantial parallel alig
nment with the primary shaft, 
   said mechanism operative such that movement of the control block in one 

direction closes the actuator arm to pivot about the pivot pin and slide to 
control yoke in an opposite direction along the control shaft for effecting 

clutched engagement between the transmission mainshaft and the mainshaft 
gear by the clutching mechanism, and said improvement characterized by said 

pivot pin having a substantially cylindrical pivot surface disposed intermediate 
an enlarged head and an annular groove and extending through aligned openings 

through the transmission housing and actuator arm with the pivot surface within 
the actuator arm opening with the actuator arm held in a pivotable condition 

against the transmission housing between the head of the pivot pin and a 
retaining ring extending radially outwardly from the groove. 
The mechanism of claim 2 wherein the control block has an inner 
peripheral surface surrounding an opening therein and the primary shaft includes 

at least one protuberance extending radially outwardly therefrom and the control 
block is selectively engaged by the primary shaft upon rotation of the primary 

shaft to a rotational position predetermined to enable the protuberance to enter 
into a slot in the peripheral surface.
