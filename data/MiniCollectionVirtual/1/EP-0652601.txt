<ABSTRACT>
A hydrogen-absorbing alloy electrode utilizes as an 
electrode material a hydrogen-absorbing alloy having selectively 

oriented crystals, which is expressed in terms of a 
specific maximum value obtained from analysis of powder X-ray 

diffractometry. This electrode, in which the hydrogen-absorbing 
alloy used is hardly pulverized upon repeated 

charge-discharge cycles and oxidation thereof is suppressed, 
gives metal hydride alkaline secondary batteries having 

excellent cycle characteristics. A method for evaluating 
hydogen-absorbing alloys for electrode comprises, utilizing 

the fact that there exists a clear relationship between 
specific parameters obtained by analyzing data based on the 

hydrogen-absorbing alloy to be evaluated and the characteristics 
of the electrode obtained therefrom, preparing and 

using analytical curves with the specific parameters. This 
method can evaluate rapidly and precisely various 

characteristics of hydrogen-absorbing alloys for electrode, 
without actually fabricating test cells therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method
for evaluating hydrogen-absorbing alloys for electrode material.Hydrogen-absorbing alloys capable of absorbing and
discharging hydrogen have been developed actively in recent
years. Metal hydride alkaline secondary batteries utilizing
these hydrogen-absorbing alloys as negative electrode
materials have been attracting much attention and expected
to become a mainstream in the next generation, since they
are lighter and can be provided with higher capacity as
compared to lead, nickel-cadmium and like conventional
secondary batteries.Hydrogen-absorbing alloys used for batteries must
absorb or discharge hydrogen at near room temperature. 
Representative examples of these alloys currently in actual
use are CaCu5-type alloys having a basic structure of LaNi5
or MmNi5. In addition, various studies have been made to
commercialize AB2-type alloys having a C14Laves structure,
which are expected to become of high capacity. The important features of hydrogen-absorbing
alloy electrodes are evaluated by determining the degree of
activation in an initial stage of cycles, corrosion resistance,
initial electrode capacity, charge-discharge cycle
characteristics (retention of capacity) and like properties.
These evaluations have been made on sample batteries
actually prepared with the electrode to be tested.However, since the properties of a hydrogen-absorbing 
alloy fluctuate with minute variations in its preparation
conditions, such as roll surface speed in the liquid
quenching process, gas ejection speed in the gas atomization
process, cooling water temperature in the casting process
and the like, the properties of electrodes prepared
therefrom also fluctuate to some extents. Such being the
case, in conducting quality control of a production line, it
becomes necessary to fabricate batteries for evaluation
actually for each production lot and evaluate them for
various properties, thereby checking the characteristics of
the electrodes. This type of evaluation requires a time-consuming
process. There has therefore long been desired
development of a method for estimating the characteristics
of hydrogen-absorbing alloys as electrode materials rapidly
and precisely, without actually fabricating test batteries.In order to realize the above desire, the present
inventors have made an intensive study on the properties of
various hydrogen-absorbing alloys for electrode. As a
result, it has been found that although there exists no
distinct relationship between the composition or lattice
