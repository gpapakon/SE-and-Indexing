<ABSTRACT>
In a method for producing intraocular lenses with improved optical properties, applying to the optical part of the lens a coating to protect the surface during one or more processing steps which are carried out under conditions so that the protective coating is essentially insoluble and remains adhered to the lens, and removing the coating by changing the conditions which make the coating adhere to the lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the manufacture of 
intraocular lenses and to a method of special advantage when 
used in connection with diffractive intraocular lenses having a 
complex surface structure which is sensitive to the surface 
finishing methods normally used in intraocular lens production. The use of synthetic intraocular lenses for replacing the 
natural lens in the eye has become a very convenient way for 
the treatment of various conditions when the natural lens does 
not function appropriately, for instance when the eye is 
mechanically damaged or in various cases of cataract when the 
lens becomes opaque, resulting in serious loss of vision. This 
is a rather common condition, especially among elderly people. An intraocular lens consists of an optical part and haptics or 
loops which, depending on the type of surgery carried out, will 
anchor the lens in the eye, for instance in the capsular bag, 
and keep the optical part in a correct position after 
implantation. The optical part is prepared from a transparent 
material and usually has the form of a circular lens with a 
diameter of about 4 to 8 mm. The material is often acrylate, 
especially poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA), polycarbonate, 
silicone or a hydrogel. The haptics, loops or legs which they 
sometimes are called, can be made of a different material, for 
instance polypropylene, and are attached via drilled holes to 
the optical part, or be made of the same material as the 
optical part. In this latter case the lens is often 
manufactured in one-piece from a sheet of lens material and the 
haptics are formed integrally with the optical part. The 
manufacture of a lens involves several steps for forming the 
appropriate optical properties and the appropriate loop 
configuration. These steps are carried out by the use of 
techniques such as compression moulding, lathe cutting, laser  
 
cutting, drilling, etc. Even if it is possible to produce a 
great variety of intraocular lenses by using these procedures, 
some of them have the drawback of giving rise to sharp edges 
and other irregularities on the optical as well as the haptic 
parts. Such irregularities on the lens surface may after 
implantation induce inflammatory responses and mechanical 
trauma in the eye. It is therefore important that the 
manufacturing method involves steps for obtaining a very smooth 
lens surface. The procedures normally utilized comprise 
tumbling the lenses in a slurry containing a mixture of various 
polishing agents. The purpose of the
