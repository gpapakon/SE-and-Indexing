<ABSTRACT>
An improved catalyst for producing carbon fibrils is made by incorporating an effective yield-enhancing amount of a carboxylate into a fibril-forming catalyst. Alternatively, such a catalyst is made by coprecipitating a compound of a metal having fibril-forming catalytic properties and an aluminum and/or magnesium compound, optionally in the presence of carbon particles or carbon fibril aggregates. The catalyst may also be made by incorporating a compound of a fibril-forming metal onto magnesia particles in carbon particles or carbon fibril aggregates. The catalysts, methods of using them to form carbon fibrils and those carbon fibrils are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Carbon fibrils are vermicular carbon deposits
having diameters less than 500 nanometers. They exist in
a variety of forms, and have been prepared through the
catalytic decomposition of various carbon-containing
gases at metal surfaces.Tennent, U.S. 4,663,230, describes carbon
fibrils that are free of a continuous thermal carbon
overcoat and have multiple graphitic outer layers that
are substantially parallel to the fibril axis. They
generally have diameters no greater than 0.1 micron and
length to diameter ratios of at least 5. Desirably they
are substantially free of a continuous thermal carbon
overcoat, i.e., pyrolytically deposited carbon resulting
from thermal cracking of the gas feed used to prepare
them.Tubular fibrils having graphitic layers that
are substantially parallel to the microfiber axis and
diameters between 3.5 and 75 nanometers, are also
described in WO 87/07559; WO 89/07163; WO 90/07023 and
WO 90/14221. Fibrils are useful in a variety of
applications. For example, they can be used as
reinforcements in fiber-reinforced composite structures
or hybrid composite structures (i.e. composites
containing reinforcements such as continuous fibers in
addition to fibrils). The composites may further contain
fillers such as a carbon black and silica, alone or in
combination with each other. Examples of reinforceable
matrix materials include inorganic and organic polymers,
ceramics (e.g., lead or copper). When the matrix is an
organic polymer, it may be a thermoset resin such as
epoxy, bismaleimide, polyamide, or polyester resin; a
thermoplastic resin; or a reaction injection molded
resin. The fibrils can also be used to reinforce
continuous fibers. Examples of continuous fibers that
can be reinforced or included in hybrid composites are
aramid, carbon, and glass fibers, alone, or in
combination with each other. The continuous fibers can
be woven, knit, crimped, or straight.The composites can exist in many forms,
including foams and films, and find application, e.g., as
radiation absorbing materials (e.g., radar or visible
radiation), adhesives, or as friction materials for 
clutches or brakes. Particularly preferred are fibril-reinforced
composites in which the matrix is an
elastomer, e.g., styrene-butadiene rubber, cis-1,4-polybutadiene,
or natural rubber.In addition to reinforcements, fibrils may be
combined with a matrix to create composites having
enhanced thermal, and/or electrical conductivity, and/or
optical properties. They can be used to increase the
surface area of a double layer
