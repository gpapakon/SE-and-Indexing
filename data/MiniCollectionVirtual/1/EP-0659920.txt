<ABSTRACT>
A loom guide bar blade for automatic weaving machinery 
such as an air jet loom, wherein the surface which contacts yarn 

is nitrided to form a nitrided hardened layer. In automatic high-speed 
weaving machinery, wearing and the like on surfaces 

contacting the yarn is thereby prevented. As a result, the 
inconvenience of yarn fluffing due to contact with roughened 

surfaces caused by abrasion is avoided. Accordingly, the loom 
guide bar blade of the present invention is advantageously used in 

automatic high-speed weaving machinery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a loom guide bar blade with
its surface nitrided for hardening which is used for an
automatic loom such as an air jet loom or a water jet loom.Generally, a plurality of pieces of guide bar blades 10 shown in
FIg. 1 and not less than two guide bars incorporated into a
frame 32 shown in Fig. 2 are installed into an automatic loom.More strict wear resistance becomes to be required for loom
guide bar blades used for an air jet loom or a water jet loom
with the recent speed-up of the automatic loom. Heretofore, a
material such as metastable austenitic stainless steel,
remarkably superior in work hardening, or ferritic stainless
steel, wherein the surface is hard-plated, has been employed
as a material for the above guide bar blades in order to
maintain corrosion resistance as well as the above wear
resistance.However, recently, further speed-up of weaving machinery
has been promoted. The above material involves a problem from
the viewpoint of wear resistance in promoting the further
speed-up. Namely, Vickers hardness of about 500Hv is a limit
in improving hardness of metastable austenitic stainless
steel by work hardening. Since the above material cannot 
withstand high-speed rotation of a loom, for example, not less
than 500r.p.m. (revolutions per minute), and is worn away
greatly, yarn fluffs in a short time, which causes a
difficulty in keeping weaving. Besides, to improve surface
hardness, for example, TiN coating by physical vapour
deposition (PVD) or hard chromium plating is available.
Although this method can provide sufficient surface hardness,
on the other hand, the method involves a problem that coating
or plating easily peels due to the flexibility of guide bar
blades because adhesiveness of base materials to the above
coating or plating is not sufficient.EP 0 550 752 discloses a hardened reed for a high speed
loom formed of a stainless steel base layer having an
intermediate layer formed of, for example, titanium
carbide, on top of which is a diamond-like carbon (DLC)
film.In the meantime, a carbo-nitrided iron material easy
rusts as same as the above stainless steel in case of being
frequently exposed to water projection, for example, in a
water jet loom. As a result, yarn passing through guide bar
blades discolors so that this material is not suitable to
make guide bar blades therefrom.In view of the forgoing, it is desired to
provide a guide bar blade superior in wear
resistance and also in anti corrosion properties.A guide bar blade and a method of forming such a
