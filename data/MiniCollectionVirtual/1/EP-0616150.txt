<ABSTRACT>
A gear shift system for an automatic transmission, 
in which a plurality of planetary gear sets (PG0,PG1,PG2,PG3) arrayed 

on a common axis and each including a plurality 
of rotating elements are arranged in a casing, and 
in 
which an extension housing is attached to the axial 

end portion of the casing. The gear shift system 
comprises: a one-way clutch (F2) arranged in the extension 

housing for selectively fixing the rotating elements 
of a predetermined one (PG3) of the planetary gear sets arranged 

at the end side of the casing; and a multi-disc 
brake (B4) in a parallel relation to the one-way clutch (F2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gear shift
system to be used in an automatic transmission for a
vehicle.Both a plurality of planetary gear sets constructing
the gear train of the automatic transmission for
a vehicle, and frictional engage elements such as
clutches or brakes for connecting or fixing the rotating
elements of the planetary gear sets selectively
are generally accommodated in an integral casing.
Moreover, a speed meter gear and a bearing for an output
shaft may be accommodated in an extension housing
connected to an end portion of the casing, as disclosed,
for example, in document JP-A-5126174 published on May 21, 1993.This construction will be briefly described in
the following. The casing is formed at its rear end
portion (as located at the opposite side to the torque
converter) with a wall portion which is projected to 
the radial center. There are provided a multi-disc
brake and a one-way clutch for selectively fixing the
ring gear of a planetary gear set arranged close to
that wall portion. The multi-disc brake has a brake
hub made of the ring gear and a brake drum made of the
casing such that the brake disc is splined to the
outer circumference of the ring gear whereas the brake
plate is splined to the inner circumference of the
casing. On the other hand, the one-way clutch is arranged
between the aforementioned planetary gear set
and the wall portion such that its inner race member is connected
to the aforementioned ring gear and its outer
race member splined to the inner circumference of the casing.
Moreover, the piston for applying the aforementioned
multi-disc brake is reciprocally fitted in the aforementioned
wall portion. As a result, the piston is
formed into a cylindrical shape covering the aforementioned
one-way clutch and has its leading end portion
formed with a projection which is projected toward the
multi-disc brake through a portion of the outer race member
of the one-way clutch.As a result, in the gear shift system according to document JP-A-5126174
described above, the rotation of the ring gear
in a predetermined direction is blocked by applying
the one-way clutch, and the piston is moved forward to 
apply the multi-disc brake to connect and fix the ring
gear to the casing. Thus, the reaction at the time of
blocking the rotation of the ring gear is received by
the casing.In the gear shift system according to document JP-A-5126174, the
piston for applying the multi-disc brake is arranged
across the one-way clutch so that it has to be extended
toward the multi-disc
