<ABSTRACT>
The stop ring (40) of an optical connector is made by
molding. The intermediate section (44) of the stop ring is

tapered to the front end to provide a satisfactory strength
when the rear section of the stop ring is pressed by

crimping. The rear section (46) is provided with a knurl (409) having
front or sharp edges to provide resistance to separation of

the braid (151) of an optical cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical connectors and,
especially, to an optical connector having an improved stop
ring.A conventional optical connector will be described below.
As Fig. 7(a) shows, an optical fiber cable 10 comprises a
fiber element 11, a core wire 13, a braid 15, and a sheath
17. When the optical fiber cable 10 is attached to a
connector, a variety of components are attached to the
optical fiber cable 10. Different lengths of the sheath 17,
braid 15, and core wire 13 are removed in order to expose
the fiber element 11, core wire 13, and braid 15. Then, as
Fig. 7(b) shows, a ferrule 19 is attached to a front end of
the optical fiber cable 10 before components of the
connector are attached. Fig. 8 shows the optical fiber
cable 10 attached to the connector 1.In Fig. 8, the optical fiber cable 10 is attached to the
ferrule 19 via the fiber element 11 and the core wire 13.
The fiber element 11 goes through the ferrule 19 and
attached to the front end of the ferrule. The core wire 13
is inserted into and attached to the rear opening of the
ferrule 19.The connector 1 comprises a plug frame 20, a coil spring 30,
a stop ring 40, a deformable ring 50, a pressure ring 60, an
insulative hood 70, and a knob 80. These components are
assembled in sequence at the front end of the optical fiber
cable 10. The ferrule 19 attached to the optical fiber
cable 10 is inserted into the plug frame 20 from back
through an opening of an inner flange 21 until an outer
flange 18 of the ferrule 19 abuts against the inner flange
21. The coil spring 30 is placed between the outer flange 18 of
the ferrule 19 and the stop ring 40 which is made from a
metal to bias the ferrule 19 forwardly so that upon
plugging, the ferrule 19 is movable in the axial direction.The stop ring 40 is placed behind the plug frame 20 so as to
cover the coil spring 30. The front section of the stop
ring 40 is inserted into the rear opening of the plug frame
20. Fig. 9 shows the stop ring 40 and the plug frame 20.
In order to connect the plug frame 20 and the stop ring 40,
a pair of arcuate projections 41 are provided on the stop
ring 40 while a pair of slots 22 are provided in the plug
frame 20. When the front end of the stop ring 40 is
inserted into the rear opening of the plug frame 20, the
rear section of the plug frame 20 snaps the stop ring 40,
with the arcuate projections 41 of the stop ring 40 are
fitted into the slots 22 of the plug frame 20.The deformable ring 50 made from aluminum is placed on the
rear section of the stop ring 40,

<CLAIMS>
An optical connector for an optical fiber cable
comprising a core wire and a braid, comprising:


a ferrule to be connected to said core wire;
a connector frame for holding said ferrule and
having a rear section;
a molded stop ring having a rear section and a
front section which is fixed to said rear section of said

connector frame such that said optical fiber cable is drawn
rearwardly; and
a deformable ring to be pressed on said rear
section of said stop ring to secure said braid on said rear

section of said stop ring.
An optical connector according to claim 1, wherein said
stop ring is provided with an intermediate section between

said front and rear sections, said intermediate section
being tapered to said front section.
An optical connector according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
said rear section of said stop ring is provided with a

knurl.
An optical connector according claim 3, wherein said

knurl has such a form as to provide resistance to rearward
pulling of said braid when said deformable ring is pressed

on said rear section of said stop ring.
