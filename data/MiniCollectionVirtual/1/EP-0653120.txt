<ABSTRACT>
Devices are disclosed for controlling high frequency signals such as optic or electric signals by the generation of acoustic waves. The devices use certain bulk or surface-modified crystalline substrates which have a surface with a receiving area and an input (16) interdigital transducer deposited on the signal receiving area of the substrate surface which is suitable for connection to a source or signal (12) and for inverse piezoelectrically generating acoustic waves in the crystalline substrate (16). The crystalline substrates are of a material having a piezoelectric-elastic dielectric matrix capable of the generation of acoustic waves and for bulk substrates, are of MTiOXO4 (where M is K, Rb, T1, and/or NH4 and X is P and/or As) having mm2 symmetry. The receiving area of the surface-modified crystal substrates has alternating sections of crystalline material which are aligned and have a ferroelectric domain structure opposite to that of adjacent sections, and IDT for said substrates is in contact with said alternating sections.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acoustic wave devices 
employing crystalline materials, and more particularly 
to the use of crystalline materials having piezoelectric 
properties such as KTiOPO4 in acoustic wave devices. Surface acoustic waves (i.e., "SAWs"), also known 
as Rayleigh waves, have been known since the middle of 
the nineteenth century. However, it was not until much 
later that the phenomenon of SAW propagation was first 
exploited for its applications to electronic devices. 
Acoustic wave devices known in the art commonly consist 
of a substrate on which a conductive material is 
deposited in a predetermined pattern. The patterned 
conductive material is known as an interdigital 
transducer (i.e., an IDT). R. M. White et al., Appl. 
Phys. Let., Volume 7, Number 12, pages 314-316 
(December 15, 1965), describes the use of the IDT as an 
efficient technique for the generation and detection of 
surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric surface. An 
IDT may be suitably connected to an electrical input so 
that the refractive index in a crystal is changed as 
required by acoustic-optic applications. See, e.g., 
K. S. Buritskii et al., Sov. Tech Phys. Lett. 17(8) 
pp. 563-565 (1991) and L. Kunn et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 
17(6) pp. 265-267 (1970). In other applications, an IDT 
on one end of a substrate surface may be connected to a 
source of the frequency waves (e.g., television antenna 
- radio frequency) and an IDT on the other end of the 
substrate surface may be connected to a device designed 
to receive a predetermined frequency (e.g., radio  
 
frequency for a specific television channel). The 
design of the IDT (i.e., the pattern of the conductive 
materials on the surface of a particular type df 
substrate) determines how the frequency will be 
controlled (e.g., which channel is received). The types of acoustic waves which may be generated 
in a given crystal depend upon the piezoelectric-elastic-dielectric 
(i.e., PED) matrix of the crystal, 
which in turn depends on the crystal structure. In 
other words, not all materials are suitable for SAW 
generation, and materials which are suitable for SAW 
generation may not be suitable for generation of other 
types of acoustic waves. The properties of the 
substrate (e.g., the crystal structure) will determine 
the type of acoustic wave that will be generated, 
mechanism of the control and how high a frequency can be 
controlled. Radio frequency control devices using substrates 
capable of controlling the received radio frequency by
