<ABSTRACT>
Injectable compositions for the sustained release of biologically active proteins and polypeptides comprise lecithin, a lecithin solvent which is pharmaceutically acceptable for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection and which is not substantially soluble in water, and a biologically active compound. Upon intramuscular or subcutaneous administration the compositions form in vivo a lecithin gel which provides the sustained release of the biologically active compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
Sustained release dosage forms can decrease the frequency of administration
of biologically active compounds and can also serve to reduce side effects by
reducing peak serum levels of the compounds. There is also a significant advantage
in administering biologically active proteins and polypeptides in sustained release
dosage forms, since compounds of those classes generally have short biological half-lives.Aqueous gels of pharmaceutically acceptable polymers such as gelatin,
methylcellulose and polyethylene glycol have been used to control the release rate
of drugs from dosage forms. The diffusion of drugs through such gels is hindered
by the viscosity of these systems as well as the tortuous diffusion path that results
from the three dimensional polymeric network that is present. These gels cannot
easily be used to sustain the release of drugs administered parenterally due to the
inherent problem of injecting such viscous materials through a hypodermic needle.
In addition, the high molecular weight of these polymers prevent their rapid
elimination from the injection site.Lecithin gels are known per se, see e.g., Scartazzini et al., J. Phys. Chem.,
92:829-833 (1988) and Luisi et al., Colloid Polym. Sci., 268:356-374 (1990). These gels
are formed ex vivo by the addition of a critical amount of water to a mixture of
lecithin and an organic solvent for the lecithin. Lecithin gels have many of the
rheological properties of polymeric gels.In accordance with the invention, it has been found that a lecithin gel can be
formed in vivo by the intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of a solution of
lecithin in a medium chain triglyceride or mixture of medium chain triglycerides.
The lecithin gels of the invention are formed in vivo by absorption of water from the
aqueous interstitial fluid at the injection site.It has further been discovered that in vivo formed lecithin gels may be used
as vehicles to sustain the in vivo release of biologically active proteins or 
polypeptides. The preferred compounds are proteins and polypeptides, e.g.,
interferon α (IFN-α) and human growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) or analogs
thereof having GRF activity.The document, WO-A-8804556 discloses compositions for nasal
administration of drugs such as polypeptides, e.g., interferon, which comprise
besides the active drug phospholipids such as lecithin and, optionally, a vegetable
oil, e.g., peanut oil. The document, FR-A-2519864 discloses oily compositions for the
administration of anti-tumour agents which are sparingly
