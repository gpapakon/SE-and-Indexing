<DESCRIPTION>
 ENCAPSULATED BREAKER CHEMICALThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending applications serial number 07/446,572, filed on December 4, 1989 and serial numbers 07/446,831, and 07/446,958, each filed on December 6, 1989.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to encapsulated breaker chemicals which are used in fracturing fluid systems. The encapsulat¬ ed breaker chemical comprises a breaker chemical which is encapsulated within an elastomeric polymeric coating which is suitably permeable to permit the breaker chemical to be released through the polymeric coating into the fracturing fluid. The polymeric coating of the instant invention comprises a neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer.DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ARTSolids (e.g., substrates, pipes, slabs, sheets, etc.) can be protected from the external environment with the use of barrier or protective coating materials. For protection from water or moisture, polymer or organic materials are widely used. For coat effectiveness, however, these materials are generally applied as thin films. The thickness of the film depends upon the desired degree of water protec¬ tion. The thicker the film the more likely that water penetration would be slowed down. In practice, applying an effective thin coating is difficult because of the various stresses tending to make the film discontinuous (e.g., film-rupture, pin holes). Films will rupture when a threshold stress is exceeded. The lateral stress tending to rupture a film is inversely proportional to an exponential power of the film thickness. The thinner the film, the more easily it will rupture.There are many applications for thickened or gelled solutions of polymers in aqueous or organic liquids which are quite diverse. 

 There are also a number of physical and chemical techniques for preparing such systems. Such systems are used for viscosity control, solids carrying and fluid loss control in fracturing fluids or to place sand or gravel packs downhole in oil or gas wells.Many types of fluids are available for use in wellbore fracturing procedures. Chief properties required by the fracturing fluids are low leak off rate, the ability to carry a propping agent and low pumping friction loss. The fluid should also be easy to remove from the formation; it should be compatible with natural formation fluids; and it should cause a minimum of damage to the formation permeability. These properties can be achieved with oil based fluids, water based fluids, emulsions, foam, and other multi¬ phase
