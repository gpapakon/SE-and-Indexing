<ABSTRACT>
A safety switch device for an apparatus, having a 
door for sealing the treatment space of the apparatus, 

has a switching means which returns to a breaking position 
when the door is opened, thus preventing start or 

operation of the apparatus. The switch device has an 
operating means (8) and, cooperating with it, a locking 

means (26, 27) having a locking position for locking 
the switching means in the breaking position (Fig. 3). 

When the door is opened, the locking means is displaced 
to its locking position and prevents switching the switch 

device. Also disclosed is a microwave oven equipped with 
such a safety switch device, as well as the use of one or 

more such safety switch devices in door-equipped household 
appliances.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switch device for 
use as a safety switch in an apparatus having a door, a 
protective cover or like means for sealing a treatment 
space, said switch device being adapted to break a current 
loop circuit to prevent starting the apparatus when 
the door is open, and to be switched by a return switching 
means which during the opening movement of the door 
returns to a breaking position, in which the current loop 
circuit is open. The invention also relates to a microwave 
oven comprising an oven cavity, a microwave source for 
generating a microwave field in the cavity, a door for 
sealing the cavity during a cooking process and a safety 
switch controlled by the position of the door, and to the 
use of the switch device according to the invention as a 
safety switch in household appliances having a door for 
sealing a treatment space. Present-day household appliances, such as washing 
machines, tumble-driers, microwave ovens and the like, 
may involve a risk of injury to the user in case of incorrect 
handling. To obviate this risk, authorities and 
consumers place ever higher demands on the reliability of 
safety devices eliminating undesired conditions of operation 
of the apparatus concerned. A switch device according 
to the invention is generally usable in apparatuses 
having a door for sealing a treatment space to prevent 
starting and operating the apparatus when the door is not 
closed. For greater clarity, the invention will however 
be described in the following with reference to a microwave 
oven and the particular safety requirements which 
such an oven should meet. In general, microwave ovens should provide high safety 
against microwave leakage. The extent of this leakage 
must not exceed given limit values, e.g. if the door of 
the microwave oven is opened more than 2 mm. To achieve 
this, use is made of safety switches for inactivating the  
 
microwave source of the oven when the door is opened. A 
microwave oven should be equipped with two independent 
safety switches, at least one of which should be tamper-proof, 
i.e. not allow manipulation so that the oven can 
be started when the door is open. General solutions to this problem reside in using 
locking and retainer means for the oven door which are 
adapted to cooperate with the safety switch function. 
On the whole, there are two basic solutions of this kind. 
According to the first solution, the safety switch is 
mounted in a "labyrinth", while the door is provided with 
movable hooks which
