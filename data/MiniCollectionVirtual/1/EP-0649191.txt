<ABSTRACT>
A shielded electrical connector (2) is comprised of 
a shielded connector component (4) having a shielding 

shroud (12) integrated with a front flange section 
(10). The shielded connector (4) is positionable within 

a hermaphroditic shielding shell (25) where the shielding 
shell includes hook members (76,78) on opposing sides 

thereof for inter-engagement at the front of the shell 
members. Fasteners (90) can then be used to retain the 

two shell halves (25) together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrical connector according to the
pre-characterizing part of claim 1.It is common in telecommunication and/or data
connection systems to provide an electrical connector of
a Sub-miniature-D configuration where a shielded
electrical connector includes a metal shroud surrounding
electrical contacts, where the shroud is provided for
EMI/RFI protection and must be commoned to the shielding
braid of shielded cable to be terminated to the electrical
connector. Typically, the shielded electrical connector
is placed within a stamped and formed metal or a cast
metal outer housing comprised of two outer shell members.
It is desirable to have an effective electrical contact
between the outer shell members and both the individual
shield on the connector as well as to the cable shielding
braid. These shielding shells are typically used as the
commoning link between the shielding braid and the
individual shield on the connector, and it is often times
necessary to make contact also with the outer shielding
shell. However it is difficult to provide such an
electrical connection with the presently available
technology, and at the same time provide an easily
installable connection assembly.An electrical connector having the features of the pre-characterizing part
of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0 125 498. The shells are not shaped
identically. According to Fig. 2 of this reference, one of the two shells
includes protrusions, while in the other of the two shells there is provided
a recess having a curved guiding face along which the protrusion of
the first shell slides when the two shells are pivoted. EP-A-0 080 813
discloses an electrical connector with hermaphroditic housing parts.
However, these housing parts or shells are not pivotable.It is the object of the invention then to provide an
electrical connector providing an easy assembly
of outer shells over an inner connector assembly.This object is accomplished
in accordance with the features of claim 1. The electrical
connector assembly comprises an inner shielded
connector and outer shielding shells adapted to encompass
the inner shield connector. The assembly has
shielding shells with complementary hook  
members adjacent to one peripheral edge thereof for
locking the shell members together, and fastening means
adjacent to an opposing peripheral edge of the shell
members to retain the shell member together.Preferably the one peripheral edge is along the front
edge thereof, and the opposing peripheral edge is towards
the rear of

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (2) comprised of an inner
connector (4), and outer shells (25) adapted to encompass

the inner shielded connector, the shells (25) having
complementary hook members (76, 78) adjacent to one

peripheral edge thereof for locking the shells (25)
together, and a fastening member adjacent to an opposing

peripheral edge of the shells (25) to retain the shells
(25) together, the hook members (76, 78) being

interengageable, whereupon the shells (25) are pivotable
about the hook members (76, 78) to close the shells (25),

characterized in that a pair of identical shells (25) is
used, each shell (25) having a pair of corresponding hook

members (76,78), where the two hooks (76, 78) on one
shell (25) have a different shape, such that the slot (77,

79) of each hook (76, 78) extends in a different direction
and the first hook member (78) of the first shell engages a

second hook member (76) of the second shell and the second
hook member (76) of the first shell engages the first hook

member (78) of the second shell.
An electrical connector (2) according to claim 1,
characterized in that the peripheral edge is along the

front edge thereof, and the opposing peripheral edge is
towards the rear of the shells (25).
An electrical connector (2) according to any of the
claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the inner connector

(4) comprises an outer shield (8) comprised of a flange
(10), and in that said shells (25) include alignment

members (32, 34) positioned inside the shells (25) to
position the inner connector (4) therein.
An electrical connector (2) according to claim 3,
characterized in that the height of the flange (10) is 

somewhat larger than the inside dimension of the shells,
whereby the inner connector (4) may be positioned in one of

the shells (25), and the corresponding shell (25) can be
interengaged by way of the hook members (76, 78), and

pivoted about the peripheral edge to bring the shells (25)
into engagement with the flange (10) of the inner connector

(4).
An electrical connector (2) according to any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the shells (25)

include semi-cylindrical recesses (56) through a rear (54)
thereof for entry cf a shielded cable (6), and for

electrical engagement with a shielding braid (20) of the
cable (6).
An electrical connector (2) according to claim 5,
characterized in that the shells (25) form an electrical

interconnection between the inner connector (4) and the
Shielding braid (20) of the cable (6).
An electrical connector (2) according to any of the
proceeding claims, characterized in that the shells (25)

are conductive.
