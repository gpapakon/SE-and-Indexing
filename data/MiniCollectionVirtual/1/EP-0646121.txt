<ABSTRACT>
Polyol fatty acid polyesters having improved oxidative stability are prepared using the addition of an alkaline material to the synthesized crude polyol fatty acid polyesters before conducting the finishing of the crude. The alkaline material is added in an amount such that the finished product has a pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.5.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making polyol fatty
acid polyesters, especially sucrose polyesters, having improved
oxidative stability.Processes for preparing polyol fatty acid polyesters, including
processes that utilize solvent-free transesterification
reactions, have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,963,699, Rizzi
et al., issued June 15, 1976; 4,517,360, Volpenhein, issued
May 14, 1985; and 4,518,772, Volpenhein, issued May 21, 1985.
Additional patents describing processes for preparing lower and
higher esters of polyols include U.S. Pat. Nos.: 2,893,990, Hass
et al., issued July 7, 1959; 3,251,827, Schnell et al., issued
May 17, 1966, which discloses that the particle size of the sugar
should be kept small to avoid formation of higher esters;
3,558,597, Brachel et al., issued Jan. 26, 1971; 3,644,333, Osipow
et al., issued Feb. 22, 1972; 3,792,041, Yamagishi et al., issued
Feb. 12, 1974, all which disclose making a solution of sucrose and
fatty acid soap in water and adding the fatty acid ester and
catalyst before elevating the temperature to drive off the water;
4,032,702, James, issued June 28, 1977, which discloses using
lower esters of sucrose as emulsifiers in the preparation of lower
esters and the use of soap as a catalyst for such reactions;
4,298,730, Galleymore et al., issued Nov. 3, 1981, which also
discloses the use of soap as an emulsifier and catalyst;
4,334,061, Bossier et al., issued June 8, 1982, which discloses
the use of a water washing step to purify the polyol polyester and
incidentally discloses the use of inert gas sparging to remove
lower alcohol from the reaction between sucrose and lower alkyl
ester of fatty acid to speed the reaction and the removal of
unreacted sucrose from an initial stage of a batch reaction for no 
indicated reason; and 4,877,871, Klemann et al., issued Oct. 31,
1989. All of said above patents are incorporated herein by
reference.Many of the above patents teach processes that use solvents
to assist in the formation of a homogeneous reaction mixture.
However, the solvent must ultimately be removed before the
polyester can be ingested. Also, many of the processes involving
solvents are primarily for preparation of esters having only a low
degree of esterification, i.e. containing one or two ester groups,
that are useful as surfactants.Using alkaline materials in the process for making polyol
fatty acid polyesters is known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat
3,198,784, Griscom et al., issued August 3, 1965, discloses adding
sodium hydroxide to

A process for making polyol fatty acid polyesters, preferably sucrose
fatty acid polyesters, having improved oxidative stability comprising heating a mixture

of a polyol, a fatty acid ester, an alkali metal fatty acid soap and a catalyst to a
temperature of from 90°C to 163°C, at a pressure of from 0.1 mm Hg to 760 mm Hg
