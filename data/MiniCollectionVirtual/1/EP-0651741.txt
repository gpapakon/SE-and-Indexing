<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel crystalline salts of (S)-N5-[imino(methyl 
amino)methyl]ornithine, pharmaceutical compositions containing such salts and their use in 
medicine, more particularly the treatment and/or prophylaxis of septic shock especially the 
hypotension associated therewith. International patent application WO91/04024 (U.S. Patent 5028627) describes the use of an 
NG substituted arginine or an NG, NG- disubstituted arginine to treat hypotension. In 
particular. this patent application describes the use of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (also 
known as (5)-N5[imino(methylamino)methyl]ornithine or L-NMMA) to counteract the 
production of nitric oxide in induced hypotension and septic shock. Nitric oxide is a potent 
vasodilator and cytotoxic agent that is normally produced in the endothelium as an 
endogenous regulator of vascular tone and in macrophages as part of the host defence 
mechanism. Inappropriate increase in nitric oxide synthesis leads to exaggeration in these 
actions, so as to cause sustained and pronounced vasodilation, leading to hypofusion of 
various vital organisms. Furthermore, the substantial increase in the synthesis of nitric oxide 
in the number of cells leads to cytotoxicity and direct tissue damage, especially to the 
vascular endothelium. Kilbourn etal (Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A., 87, 3629, 1990) report the reaction of the 
flavianate salt of LNMMA with Dowex 1(OH-) and titrating the resulting free base of L-NMMA 
to pH 7.2 with hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloride was not isolated from 
solution. We have now found that the hydrochloride of L-NMMA may be obtained as a pure salt, for 
example in a crystalline form, which has considerable physical advantages, for example in 
terms of stability. Initial attempts to prepare the hydrochloride in crystalline form gave rise 
to an amorphous glass which did not crystallise. Crystals of the hydrochloride were 
unexpectedly obtained when the amorphous glass was left in the presence of ethanol for 
several months. Accordingly, the present invention provides the hydrochloride salt of (S)-N5[imino(methylamino)methyl]ornithine 
as a substantially pure salt for example in a solid 
form and more specifically in a crystalline form. This hydrochloride salt of L-NMMA is 
anhydrous and not hydroscopic.  
 Preferably the salt is at least 70%, more preferably at least 90% pure and most preferably 
greater than 95% pure. The salt exists in at least three distinguishable isomorphic form(A, Band C) as identified by 
X-ray diffraction
