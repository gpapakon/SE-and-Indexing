<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system and method
for measuring electrical energy consumption. More
particularly, but not exclusively, the invention refers to
the centralized measurement, registering reading and
billing of electric energy consumption and, more specificaly,
to a method and equipment to be installed preferably
near residential blocks of apartments, commercial
and industrial buildings and intended to measure, register
and provide information regarding individual and
global electric energy consumption.Historically, low voltage electric energy distributors
bill their clients for the consumed electricity according
to consumption readings obtained from individual meters.
These meters, installed near the consumers, are
conventionally read in loco, and the readings thus obtained
are sent to the distributing companies for
processing and billing of the clients.This method and the related equipments have been
improved and modified in an attempt to obviate several
associated problems and shortcomings which, in a situation
of large agglomerarion of consumers, such as in
large apartment buildings, are even more serious.A first aspect to be analysed, with regard to those
problems and shortcomings, is the electric energy meter
itself, which is utilized for the purposes of billing the consumers.Electricity billing has been mostly carried out with
the utilization of electromechanical meters, derived from
a technology 100 years old. In spite of their large scale
use, this type of meter presents several problems, the
most important being:
Lack of flexibility for the addition of new functions.
The evolution of the billings procedures has resulted
in the possibility and necessity of measuring and
registering new types of values, such as maximum
energy demand and differentiated consumption according
to the period of the day (hour based tariffs).
Since the electromechanical meters are, in fact,
mechanical clock mechanisms in their original concepts,
they are not compatible with modifications
and/or addition of new functions, and their physical
design must be altered whenever a new requisite is
necessary; and Lack of precision in the consumption measurement,
which becomes excessive with time and under certain
electric charge conditions. As their operation is
based in the continuous movement of internal mechanical
parts, the electromechanical meters
present a cumulative wear with time, heavily affecting
their nominal precision characteristics, even being
subject to failure in registering small electric
charges,
