<ABSTRACT>
A sludge dehydrating agent which is excellent in storage stability and prevented from becoming water-insoluble during storage 
and hence can be distributed in the market securely by solving the problem of the conventional dehydrating agents comprising 

amphoteric polymers that they undergo deterioration and become water-insoluble when stored for long, thus becoming substantially 
unusable. This dehydrating agent comprises a copolymer composed of cationic vinyl monomer units, vinylic carboxylic 

acid monomer units and nonionic vinyl monomer units and a salt of a group IIA metal of the periodic table. Preferable examples 
of the vinylic carboxylic acid monomer include acrylic, methacrylic and crotonic acids, while those of the nonionic vinyl monomer 

include acrylamide and methacrylamide. The metal salts usable herein include those of mineral acids and organic carboxylic 
acids, and preferable mineral acid salts include calcium chloride, magnesium chloride and magnesium sulfate. Preferably, the 

amount of the cationic vinyl monomer ranges from 10 to 60 mole %, while that of the vinylic carboxylic acid monomer from 10 to 
45 mole %. Preferably, the molar ratio of the cationic vinyl monomer to the vinylic carboxylic acid monomer ranges from 0.3 to 

3.0, while that of the metal salt to the carboxylic acid monomer from 0.2 to 2.0. The dehydrating agent may further contain an inorganic 
coagulant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sludge dehydrating agent comprising amphoteric polymers, and more
particularly to a sludge dehydrating agent comprising amphoteric polymers, which is excellent in storage
stability undergoing little deterioration with time.Previously dehydrating agents comprising cationic polymers have been known as sludge dehydrating
agents. However, conventional dehydrating agents are becoming unsatisfactory in performance because of
the recent worsening and diversification in sludge properties and, therefore, an improvement in the
performance thereof has been sought. In this connection, sludge dehydrating agents having strong
aggregation force and comprising amphoteric polymers have been proposed which are superior in recovery
of suspended substances, water content of cake and release of cake from filter cloth. However, conventional
sludge dehydrating agents comprising amphoteric polymers had a disadvantage that they undergo deterioration
during storage and become water-insoluble while being used. In order to solve this problem, JP-A-3-293100
proposed a sludge dehydrating agent having an improved storage stability by further adding a
specific cationic monomer onto an amphoteric polymer comprising a specific cationic monomer, an anionic
monomer and a nonionic monomer. With this improved agent, however, the shelf life is not long enough and
hence cannot be distributed securely in the market.The object of the present invention is to provide a sludge dehydrating agent which is excellent in
storage stability without becoming water-insoluble during storage by the improvement of conventional
sludge dehydrating agents comprising amphoteric polymers.In order to attain the object described above, the present invention uses a sludge dehydrating agent
comprising a mixture of a copolymer composed of cationic vinyl monomer units, vinylic carboxylic acid monomer units
and nonionic vinyl monomer units
with a mineral acid salt or an organic carboxylic acid
salt of a group IIA metal of the periodic table, the molar ratio
of said salt of a group IIA metal to the vinylic carboxylic acid monomer being in the range from 0.2 to 2.0.In the sludge dehydrating agent of the invention it is preferable to use as the cationic vinyl monomer
the following compound expressed by the general formula (1),

, wherein
R1denotes a hydrogen atom or a methyl group,R2denotes a hydrogen atom, a methyl group an ethyl group or a benzyl group,Xdenotes O or NHYdenotes CH2 CH2 , CH2 CH2 CH2 or CH2 CH(OH)CH2 ,Zdenotes a chlorine
