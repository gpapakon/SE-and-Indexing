<DESCRIPTION>
 Ant1bacter1al l-normon-2-yl thlazolyl ketonesThis invention relates to a novel class of compounds having antibacterial and antimycoplasmal activity, to processes for their preparation and to their use in human and veterinary medicine.Mupirocin, the compound of formula (A):
 exhibits good activity against Gram positive bacteria, H.influenzae,Legionella and mycoplasma. It is marketed as a topical formulation by Beecham Group pic under the Trade Mark BACTROBAN. Mupirocin(formerly known as pseudomonic acid) is rapidly hydrolysed in vivo to monic acid A, the compound of formula (B):
 which is inactive. Various proposals have been made to improve the metabolic stability of mupirocin with respect to enzymatic hydrolysis, by modifying the C-l ester functional group, including, for instance, C-l heterocyclic derivatives (EP-A-0 087 953 and EP-A-0 123 578), C-l amides (EP-A-0 001 914) and C-l ketones including heterocyclic ketones (EP-A-0 029 665). In addition, Klein et al have reported (in a poster presented at the Third Annual Chemical Congress of North America, Toronto, June 1988) the preparation of the C-l fur-2-yl, pyrid-2-yl and N-methylimidazol-2-yl ketones. These are characterised by having the heteroaryl group linked to the ketone carbonyl group by a ring carbon atom which is adjacent to the heteroatom. The limited data provided on these derivatives showed that these compounds were less active than the analogous butyl and phenyl ketones which in turn were less active than methyl pseudomonate. No results of in vivo activity were reported, the inference being that in vitro activity had not been sufficient to warrant in vivo investigation. More recently, WO 92/02518 (published after the priority date 

claimed for the present application) has disclosed several examples of heteroaryl ketones, including the 2-methylmercapto- and 2-methyl- sulphinyl thiazol-5-yl ketones.It has now however been surprisingly found that an enhanced antibacterial profile may be obtained with a narrow group of other thiazol- 5-yl ketones.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):
 in which Rl is a 2-(optionally substituted (Cι.ιo)alkoxy)thiazol-5-yl group, that is a group of the formula:
 in which R is optionally substituted (Cι.iQ)aIkoxy.Suitable optional substituents for the Qi.iQ)aikoxy group include, for example, halogen, cyano, azido, nitro, carboxy, (Cι_g)alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, mono- and di-(Cι_g)alkylcarbamoyl, sulpho, sulphamoyl, mono- or di-(Cι_g)alkylsulphamoyl, amino, mono-and di-(Cι_
