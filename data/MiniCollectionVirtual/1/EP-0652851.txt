<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for electrochemically treating calcium- and/or magnesium-containing water or waste water, in particular communal and/or industrial waste water which is chemically and/or biologically treated by means of micro-organisms in order to eliminate phosphorus and/or nitrogen. At least two electrodes are introduced in the phosphorus- and/or nitrogen-containing water to be purified and are connected to a direct current souce. An electrochemical treatment is then applied in the presence of an oxidising agent while current or voltage are kept constant.
