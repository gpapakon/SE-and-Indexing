<ABSTRACT>
Soil is decontaminated by first being subjected to 
a biological treatment in a reactor vessel (5) and then 

ozone treatment in ozone contactor (22). The biological 
treatment decomposes the less resistant contaminants 

whilst the ozone treatment oxidizes the more resistant 
contaminants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for decontaminating soil. As used herein the term "soil" means the upper 
layer of earth extending from the ground typically to a 
depth of 3 to 5 metres. Soil can become contaminated in a number of ways. 
These include the dumping of chemical waste which may be 
intentional or unintentional. Although soil will adsorb 
many noxious chemical substances these may gradually be 
leached out by the rain and pass into the aquifers from 
which drinking water is extracted. Many of these noxious chemical substances are 
highly toxic and are known to be carcinogens. Various attempts have been made to decontaminate 
soil. Biological treatment involves increasing the micro-biological 
activity in the soil to enhance the natural 
process of decomposition. However, many noxious chemical 
substances, particularly polycyclic compounds containing 
four or more rings are highly resistant to biological 
treatment. In addition, several polycyclic compounds 
containing three rings are also resistant to biological 
treatment. Chemical oxidation is effective but is relatively 
expensive. Amongst the oxidizing agents which have been 
used are ozone, hydrogen peroxide and chlorine. According to the present invention there is provided 
a method for decontaminating soil, which method 
comprises the steps of subjecting said soil to biological 
treatment followed by ozone treatment. Preferably, said biological treatment comprises 
forming a slurry by bringing said soil into contact with 
water, nutrients and air and/or oxygen in a reactor 
vessel.  Preferably, sufficient air and/or oxygen is added 
to obtain a concentration of at least 2mg dissolved O₂ 
per litre of slurry. Preferably, said method includes the step of rotating 
said reactor vessel. Advantageously, said soil, water and air and/or 
oxygen are brought into contact in a reactor having a 
rotating drum preferably provided with blades and/or 
paddles. Preferably, said nutrients comprise sources of 
phosphate, nitrogen and other elements such as K, Na, 
Mn, Mg, for example: 
(a) an organic fertiliser commercially available 
under the trademark NITROPHOSCA; or (b) organic sources of N and P such as organic 
byproducts from food processing plants Advantageously, said nutrients will be added to 
said soil so that ratio (by weight) of C:N:P is about 
100:10:1. If desired, additional microorganisms may be introduced 
into the soil, for example from freely rotting 
organic compost. Preferably, at least 10³ microorganisms are
