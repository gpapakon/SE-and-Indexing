<ABSTRACT>
In a hollow-pin link chain (G) of a conveyor apparatus, in which at least one adapter (A) for attaching a driver (M) of the chain is provided, the said adapter (A) being secured releasably in a hollow pin by means of an adapter foot (F), the adapter foot has, at its insertion end, at least one catch element (R) which is adjustable with elastic return between a holding position and a pull-out position and which, in the holding position, engages at least positively behind a countercatch on the hollow pin (4). In an adapter for the releasable fastening of a driver to a hollow-pin link chain of a conveyor apparatus, there is arranged at the insertion end of the adapter foot at least one catch element (R) which is adjustable with elastic return in the direction of the longitudinal axis out of a holding position spread away from the longitudinal axis of the adapter foot.

Hollow-pin flat-link articulated chain of a conveying 
device, with at least one adapter for mounting a driver on 

the chain, the adapter being mounted with an adapter base 
releasably in a hollow pin to prevent it from being pulled 

out, characterised in that the adapter base (F) at its 
insertion end comprises at least one latch element (R) 

which is displaceable resiliently between a retaining 
position and a pull-out position, and which in the 

retaining position can engage behind a counterlatch on the 
hollow pin (4) at least in form-locking relationship. 
Flat-link articulated chain according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the latch element (R) is a latch 

tongue (Z) with an outwardly pointing latch projection (N). 
Flat-link articulated chain according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the latch projection (N) is arranged 

at the free end (15) of the latch tongue (Z). 
Flat-link articulated chain according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the latch projection (N) - on its 

side facing away from the free end (15) of the latch tongue 
(Z) - comprises a stop face (12) located more or less 

transversely to the longitudinal axis (X) of the adapter 
base (F). 
Flat-link articulated chain according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the latch projection (N) - on its 

side facing away from the free end (15) of the latch tongue 
(Z) - comprises a ramp (12') inclined from the outside to 

the inside and away from the free end (15), preferably with 
an angle of inclination (β) of about 45°.  

 
Flat-link articulated chain according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the latch projection (N) towards the 

free end (15) comprises an insertion slope (14), preferably 
with an angle of inclination (α) of about 25° relative to 

the longitudinal axis (X) of the adapter base (F). 
Flat-link articulated chain according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the height of the latch projection 

(N) more or less corresponds to the wall thickness of the 
hollow pin (4), and in that the end face (6) of the hollow 

pin (4) forms the counterlatch for the latch projection 
(N). 
Flat-link articulated chain according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that two or more latch 

elements (R) distributed with intermediate gaps in the 
circumferential direction around the longitudinal axis (X) 

of the adapter base (F) are provided. 
Flat-link articulated chain according to claim 8, 
characterised in that two latch tongues (Z) are separated 

by a longitudinal slot (9) in the adapter base (F), which 
opens towards the free ends of the latch tongues (Z) and of 

which the width approximately corresponds to twice the 
height over which each latch projection (N) is displaceable 

out of the retaining position into the pull-out position. 
Flat-link articulated chain according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the adapter base (F) 

comprises a contact shoulder (8) at a distance from the 
latch projection (N) or projections (N) approximately 

corresponding to the length of the hollow pin (4).  
 
Flat-link articulated chain according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 10, characterised in that on the adapter base 

(F) is provided a holder (B) for fixing the driver (M). 
Flat-link articulated chain according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the adapter (A) or 

adapter base (F) is made of plastic, preferably reinforced 
plastic, light metal, metal or an alloy. 
Adapter for releasably fastening a driver to a hollow-pin 
flat-link articulated chain according to one or more of 

claims 1 to 12, characterised in that at the insertion end 
of an adapter base (F) of the adapter (A) is arranged at 

least one latch element (R) which is displaceable 
resiliently out of a retaining position forced apart from 

the longitudinal axis (X) of the adapter base (F), in a 
direction towards the longitudinal axis (X).
