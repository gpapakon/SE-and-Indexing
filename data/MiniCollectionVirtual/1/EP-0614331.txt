<ABSTRACT>
In a printed circuit board having a plural number of conductor 
layers separated by a plural number of insulator layers, a Faraday cage 

is constructed including a first and a second ground plane disposed in a 
first and second conductor layer respectively. The ground planes being 

electrically interconnected at their peripheries, preferably by a 
plurality of vias. A third conductor layer is disposed between the first 

and second conductor layers in which a plurality of signal paths are 
defined. The Faraday cage surrounds a shielded portion of the third 

conductor layer so that electrical signals conducted through the shielded 
portion are isolated from electrical noise. The invention finds 

particular application in a mixed digital/analog board separated into a 
digital section of the board having a digital ground plane defined in one 

of the conductor layers and a plurality of digital signal paths defined 

in another of the conductor layers and an analog section of the board 
having the Faraday cage and the shielded portion. Thus, the plurality of 

signal paths in the shielded region are intended for analog signals which 
are sensitive to digital noise. Additional conductor layers in the 

analog section can be added inside and outside the Faraday cage. Those 
analog signal paths located outside the cage are defined for analog 

signals which are less sensitive than analog signals in the shielded 
region. The board may be an audio card for a digital computer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to printed circuit boards. More 
particularly, it relates to a printed circuit board architecture for low 
noise operation for analog/digital circuits. Printed circuit boards are typically wired so that ground signals 
share a common plane on one of the layers of the board. This technique 
works well for digital or analog circuit boards which employ the use of 
high speed or wide bandwidth signals. It provides for relatively good 
transmission line parameter characterization which affords better 
frequency response and minimizes transmission line reflections. In a mixed analog/digital system, the resulting ground currents of 
the two disciplines are significantly different. The analog subsystem 
generally suffers from noise problems induced by the rapidly 
transitioning signals of the digital subsystem. Its noise floor is 
generally poorer than what could be achieved using the same circuits 
completely isolated from the digital signals. One means which has been 
used in the prior art to alleviate this problem is to segregate the 
signals and design the card so that the ground plane is divided into 
separate analog and digital ground planes. The technique substantially 
reduces the interaction of the ground currents, and a reduction of the 
noise crosstalk between the digital and analog sections. As shown in 
FIG. 1, the ground layer is separated into an analog and a digital ground 
plane. It is the object of the invention to provide a Printed Circuit 
board in which noise sensitive signals may be isolated from an 
electrically noisy environment. WO94/08445, which falls within the terms of article 54(3) EPC, 
describes a printed circuit board architecture having two ground planes 
which sandwich at least a third plane. The two ground planes are 
interconnected to form a Faraday cage. US-A-4922059 describes a printed circuit board which is foldable in 
order to reduce electromagnetic interference.  
 This invention as defined in claim 1 provides a printed circuit board having a plurality 
of conductor layers separated by a plurality of insulator layers, the 
board comprising: a digital section having a digital ground plane defined 
in one of the conductor layers and a plurality of digital signal paths 
defined in another of the conductor layers; an analog section having a 
first and a second ground plane disposed in a first and second conductor 
layer respectively, the ground planes being electrically interconnected 
at selected peripheral regions to form a Faraday cage, and at
