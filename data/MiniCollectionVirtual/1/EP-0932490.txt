<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for making plastic tubes, whereby a tube blank (Te) brought to a temperature close to molecular orientation temperature is subjected to a bi-axial drawing, by radial expansion of the tube blank inside a forming shaft (2), with formation of a contraction cavity at one end of the tube, by controlled displacement of this contraction cavity to the other end of the tube, and by longitudinal drawing. The radial expansion is carried out in at least two phases, viz. a first phase during which the tube blank (Te) is inflated to an intermediate diameter (Di) determined by a double-walled envelope (21), introduced into the forming shaft (2), with circulation of a hot fluid between the two walls of the envelope (21), and then the envelope is gradually removed from the forming shaft (2) to enable, during a second phase, the radial expansion of the plastic tube up to an internal diameter of the forming shaft (2), and its longitudinal drawing.

Process for manufacturing plastic tubes, in which a tube preform or parison (Te), heated to a temperature close to its molecular orientation temperature, is subjected to a biaxial stretching operation by radially expanding the parison inside a forming barrel (2), the internal diameter of which is equal to the desired diameter of the plastic tube (T), to within the thermal expansion, with formation of a bubble at one end of the tube, controlled displacement of this bubble as far as the other end of the tube, and with longitudinal stretching, in which process the radial expansion is carried out in at least two steps, namely:

a first step during which the parison (Te) is inflated uniformly up to an intermediate diameter (Di), less than the internal diameter of the forming barrel, for which the circumferential elongation remains less than or equal to the yield point of the material of the tube (Te), this first step being accomplished virtually without any longitudinal stretching, the bubble being formed at the end of this first step;
and at least one other step for passing to the internal diameter of the forming barrel (2), with longitudinal stretching.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the intermediate diameter (Di) is determined by introducing, into the forming barrel (2), a sliding sheath (21), particularly a double-walled sheath with
 internal circulation of a hot fluid, the internal diameter of which is equal to the intermediate diameter (Di), and 
in that
, after the first expansion step, this sheath (21) is progressively withdrawn from the forming barrel (2) in order to allow the second radial expansion step.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the forming barrel (2) is externally cooled.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the longitudinal stretching of the tube (Te), carried out essentially during the second step, is obtained by blocking the two ends of the parison (Te) in respective clamping means (16, 17) and by moving the clamping means (17) at one end away from the clamping means (16) at the other end of the tube (Te).
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 a pressurized gas, especially compressed air, is injected between the external wall of the plastic tube (Te) and the internal wall of the sheath (21) in order to facilitate the relative slip between these two parts during withdrawal of the sheath (21) and to avoid unwanted friction.
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 a free space (G) remains, inside the forming barrel (2), between the end of the sliding sheath (21) fitted in the barrel and the adjacent end of the barrel, this free space (G) allowing the bubble to be created, by increasing the internal pressure in the parison (Te), without beforehand having to displace the sliding sheath.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that that
 end of the plastic tube (Te) which is remote from the bubble-formation region (N) is pushed towards this region (N) at the time of creation of the bubble in order to increase the thickness of the material, making it possible to obtain a bubble with a
 thickness approximately equal to that of the remaining part of the tube.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 a rabbeted section (E), with a groove (k) for housing a seal, is produced on the plastic tube during formation of the bubble at one end of the tube.
Process according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
, when the wall of the bubble comes into contact with the wall of the mould (G) for the rabbeted section, the adjacent end of the tube is pushed towards the rabbeted section in order to obtain a wall thickness in the region of the groove (k) approximately equal to that of the rest of the rabbeted section and of the tube.
Process according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the forming barrel (2) is cooled externally by spraying (R) or regulation.
Apparatus for implementing the process according to Claim 1 or 2, comprising a forming barrel (2) in which the parison (Te) is engaged, and means (16, 17) for closing off and for clamping each end of the parison, together with means (16a, 17a, C1) for introducing a fluid, especially a liquid, into the parison and for making the pressure of this fluid vary, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a double-walled sheath (21) and means (22, 23) for making a hot fluid flow through this sheath (21), the latter being mounted so as to slide in the forming barrel (2) and determining, by its inside diameter (Di), an intermediate diameter of expansion of the plastic tube, this sheath surrounding one end of the parison (Te), which end is provided with clamping means (17) forming a piston mounted so as to slide in the sheath (21) and fastened to a cylinder (18) extending beyond the end of the sheath (21), independent sliding drive means (24, B) being provided for the sheath (21) and for the cylinder (18) provided with the piston (17), respectively.
Apparatus according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the piston (17) mounted at the end of the cylinder includes passage means (20) for injecting a pressurized gas, especially compressed air, between the external wall of the plastic tube (Te) and the internal wall of the sheath (21).
Apparatus according to Claim 11 or 12, 
characterized in that
 it includes, at the opposite end of the forming barrel (2) from the cylinder (18) provided with the piston, means (16) for clamping the end of the plastic tube (Te), which also form means for closing off the forming barrel and which define a mould (G) for a rabbeted section (E) of the plastic tube.
Apparatus according to Claim 13, 
characterized in that
 the mould (G) for the rabbeted section (E) comprises at least two parts (3,10; 13,14) which define a groove (k) for a seal and are mounted so as to slide one with respect to the other, the part (13, 14) located axially towards the outside of the plastic tube (Te) being capable of moving closer to the other part (3,10) in order to bring material to the groove (k) for the seal.
Apparatus according to Claim 14, 
characterized in that
 means (S) for detecting the arrival of the wall of the rabbeted section (E) against the corresponding part of the mould (G) are provided in order to initiate the displacement of the other part (13,14) of the mould when contact has been established.
