<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a low-pressure mercury discharge lamp 
comprising 


a first lamp vessel (La1) provided with a first electrode (E11), with a filling 
comprising mercury and rare gas, and with a first luminescent layer which 

radiates white light of a first colour temperature during lamp operation, 
a second lamp vessel (La2) provided with a second electrode (E12), with a 
filling comprising mercury and rare gas, and with a second luminescent layer 

which radiates white light of a second colour temperature different from the 
first during lamp operation, 
means I for generating a first current through the first lamp vessel and a second 
current through the second lamp vessel, 
means II for adjusting the ratio between the effective value of the first current 
and the effective value of the second current. 
According to the invention, the low-pressure mercury discharge lamp is 
characterized in that the first and the second lamp vessel are interconnected by means of 

a connection (V) which allows the filling to pass and together enclose a discharge space, 
in that the first current and the second current are high-frequency currents of changing 

polarity, and in that the discharge space contains only one further electrode (E13). 
It is achieved thereby that the colour temperature of the light radiated by 
the lamp can be adjusted over a comparatively wide range, while the lamp is of a 

simple construction and has a comparatively high luminous efficacy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a low-pressure mercury discharge lamp 
comprising 
a first lamp vessel provided with a first electrode, with a filling comprising 
mercury and rare gas, and with a first luminescent layer which radiates white 
light of a first colour temperature during lamp operation, a second lamp vessel provided with a second electrode, with a filling 
comprising mercury and rare gas, and with a second luminescent layer which 
radiates white light of a second colour temperature different from the first 
during lamp operation, means I for generating a first current through the first lamp vessel and a second 
current through the second lamp vessel, means II for adjusting the ratio between the effective value of the first current 
and the effective value of the second current. Such a low-pressure mercury discharge lamp is known from Japanese 
Patent publication JP-A3-222290. In the known low-pressure mercury discharge lamp, 
both the first and the second lamp vessel is provided with two electrodes, while both the 
first and the second current is a direct current. The compositions of the first and second 
luminescent layers were so chosen that during lamp operation the two lamp vessels 
radiate white light of which the colour point either coincides with a point of the 
Planckian locus or is situated close to the Planckian locus. Since the colour points of the 
light radiated by the first and the second lamp vessel were chosen to be different, it is 
possible to adjust the colour point of the light radiated jointly by the two lamp vessels 
over a certain range by using the means II. Each colour point within this range lies on 
the Planckian locus or in the immediate vicinity thereof. As a result, the colour of the 
light radiated by the low-pressure mercury discharge lamp is perceived as pleasant by 
the human eye. A disadvantage of the known low-pressure mercury discharge lamp is,  
 
however, that its luminous efficacy is low while in addition the use of a direct current 
may lead to striations. The construction of the known low-pressure mercury discharge 
lamp, moreover, is comparatively expensive. It is an object of the invention to provide a low-pressure mercury 
discharge lamp whose colour point is adjustable, whose luminous efficacy is 
comparatively high, and whose construction is comparatively simple. According to the invention, this object is achieved in a low-pressure 
mercury discharge lamp of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph in that the first 
and the second lamp vessel are
