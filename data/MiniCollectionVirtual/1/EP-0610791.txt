<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a longitudinal guide rail (14) mounted on a stationary part of the frame (10, 12), a lower conveyor mounted on a lower longitudinal member (30), and, in correspondence, an upper conveyor secured by adjustable means (44, 47) to an upper longitudinal member (43) integral with a bracket (50). The upper longitudinal member (43) of the upper conveyor is connected via the bracket (50) directly to the lower longitudinal member (30) of the lower conveyor and the exit end of the lower longitudinal member (30) is mounted, pivoting (16) in a horizontal plane, on a stationary part of the frame (10) close to the guide rail (14), it being possible for the entry end of the lower longitudinal member (30) to be separated from the guide rail (14) by a predetermined value by virtue of mechanical or electromechanical means (55, 56).

Device for aligning box blanks in a machine processing them, 
comprising a lengthwise guiding rail (14) fitted on a fixed part of the frame 

(10,12), a lower carrier fitted on a lower lengthwise beam (30) and, in 
correspondence, an upper carrier which is fitted to an upper lengthwise 

beam (43) through adjusting means (44, 47), the upper lengthwise beam 
being attached to a bracket (50), the exit end of the lower lengthwise beam 

(30) is horizontally pivotable (16) and fitted on a fixed part of the frame (10) 
close to the guiding rail, the entrance end of the lower lengthwise beam 

being movable away from the guiding rail with a predetermined rate owing 
to mechanical or electromechanical means (55, 56), characterized by the 

fact that the upper lengthwise beam of the upper carrier is connected 
directly to the lower lengthwise beam of the lower carrier through the 

bracket. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that 
the lower carrier comprises an endless belt (20) which is supported by 

lower rollers (35) and, in combination, the upper carrier consists of a row of 
upper rollers (40) which are fitted at the end of levers (41) pivoting in a 

vertical plane and whose other end is fitted on a ramp (42) itself fitted to the 
upper lengthwise beam (43) through adjusting means (44, 45, 46, 47), the 

upper rollers being in vertical correspondence with the lower rollers. 
Device according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that 
every lever (41) carries a lengthwise pair of rollers (40). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the belt (20) is driven by a drive pulley (26) and tensioned by a tension 

pulley (24) which is under the influence of elastic means (25), both pulleys 
being fitted on a neighbouring vertical base plate (10), the said belt being 

twice twisted by a half turn with the help of guide pulleys (21/31, 28/31) in 
order to have a vertical part once at the entrance and again at the exit of 

the rotatable lower lengthwise beam (30).  
 
Device according to one of the aforementioned claims, 
characterized by the tact that the upper rollers (40) apply pressure onto a 

blank, on the one hand, by means of vertical flat springs (48) surrounding 
the horizontal pivoting axle of the lever, one of the branches acting on the 

upper surface of the lever and the other branch acting against an inner wall 
of the ramp and, on the other hand, by means of an assembly consisting of 

a threaded adjusting rod (44) which is screwed on the ramp (42) and fitted 
to the lengthwise beam (43) through a pair of knurled knobs (49) engaged 

on the said rod.
