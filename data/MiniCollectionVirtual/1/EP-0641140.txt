<ABSTRACT>
A number of subsystems are to be combined to form one communications network, no dedicated tie lines being required. The exchange of switching information is to take place universally via the voice channels of switched connections. After the dialling of a code number provided for connecting a first subsystem to another subsystem, a virtual network control is looped into the connection within the subsystem setting up the connection. This control contains a transmit control and a receive control which operates in conjunction with a decentralised or centralised control device of this subsystem. After a connection via the public ISDN communications network has been set up to the other subsystem by converting the code number into a line number, data words which contain switching information for the destination subsystemate formed by the transmit control and transmitted in the voice channel. When a number of subsystems are combined to form one communications network, their site does not need to be considered. No special line interfaces need to be provided in these subsystems and no network specific tie lines need to be set up.

A method for operating a digital communications network with several subsystems, wherein
connections between the individual subsystems are generated via access lines of the public

communications network ISDN, and a transmission of code marks occurs via the access line occupied
thereby, whereby the subsystems to be interconnected exchange switching-oriented information to

enable controlling such connections according to predetermined criteria, and wherein code numbers
are converted, 
characterised in that

after the dialling of a code number for the connection from a first subsystem (VA1) to an other
subsystem (VA2) of the communications network comprising several subsystems (VA1 to VAn)

within the subsystem (VA1) setting up the connection when connecting the called terminal (EG1) with
an access line (EL) of the public communications network ISDN a virtual network control (VNS) is

looped in this connection, the virtual network control (VNS) comprising a transmission control (SST)
and a receive control (EST) both cooperating with a non-central or central control unit (SE) of this

subsystem (VA1),

after the set up of a connection via the public communications network ISDN to an other subsystem
(VA2) resulting from the conversion of the code number data words (DW) are generated, the data

words comprising additional switching-oriented information, being structured like PCM words, and
being located in an information field (F4) of a signalling message format (MF) having several fields

(F1 to F6),

the whole signalling message format (MF) is transmitted via the B-channel already switched through
for a voice connection to the called subsystem (VA2), wherein at the beginning byte sequences are

transmitted in the first field (F1A, F1B, F1C), the byte sequences comprising only such bytes selected
from the total of 256 possibilities given by the PCM method that are applied as information in the

other fields (F2 to F6),

and 
in that
 the receive control (EST) of the called switch (VA2) recognises from the byte sequences of
the first field (F1A, F1B, F1C) that it is not about digitised speech but is about a signalling message

format (MF) comprising additional switching-oriented information, wherein the additional information
comprised in the data words (DN) of a field (F4) is evaluated about the kind of connection as well as

the features and authorisations of the called terminal (EG1) in the called subsystem (VA2). 
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 in the first section of the first field
(F1A) of the signalling message format (MF) a sequence of n bytes is sent that is very unlikely for

voice coding,

the field sections following thereafter (F1B, F1C) each comprise byte sequences of equal number with
decreasing valency, the first group in the field section (F1B) having a different sign than the second

group in the field section (F1C),

and 
in that
 the existence of a signalling message format (MF) with additional switching-oriented
information is recognised by the byte combinations transmitted in all three field sections (F1A, F1B,

F1C) in the called subsystem (VA2).
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the PCM words sent in the first field
(F1A, F1B, F1C) as byte sequences have the greatest code distance from each other,

and 
in that
 changes of these PCM words due to damping or code transformations in the transmission
line are recognised by the receive control (EST) of the called switch (VA2) and are considered on the

reception of the other fields (F2 to F6) of the signalling message format (MF).
The method according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the subsequent field (F2) of the
signalling message format (MF) comprises specifications about the number and the kind of the

signalling message, and the subsequent field (F3) comprises the length of the information field (F4).
The method according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the pre-last field (F5) comprises a
checksum, and the last field (F6) comprises an end message.
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 upon an arriving connection in a
subsystem (VA2) of a virtual communications network a virtual network control (VNS) is switched to

an access line (EL) of the public communications network ISDN, if on the signalling channel (D) an
information identifying a subsystem (VA1) of the communications network is received.
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a virtual network control (VNS) is
permanently assigned to an access line (EL) of the public communications network ISDN.
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a virtual network control (VNS)
consists of a digital signal processor and serves several access lines (EL) of the public

communications network ISDN.
The method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a virtual network control (VNS) serves
a high speed access line (e.g. 2 MB/s) consisting of several communication channels.
