<ABSTRACT>
A GaP red light emitting element substrate with 
a large amount of oxygen doped in the p-type GaP layer, and 

with very few Ga₂O₃ precipitates developed on 
and/or in the p-type 

GaP layer, and methods of manufacturing said substrate. After 
the n-type GaP layer 2 is grown on the n-type GaP single crystal 

substrate 1, the p-type GaP layer 3 doped with Zn 
and O, is formed by means of the liquid phase 

epitaxial growth method. The p-type GaP layer 3 is grown by using 
a Ga solution with a high concentration of oxygen, and said Ga 

solution is removed from the substrate 1 to complete the growth 

when the temperature is lowered to a prescribed temperature of 
980°C or higher. When the temperature has reached the prescribed 

temperature of 980°C or higher during the growth using the Ga 
solution with a high concentration of oxygen, it is also possible 

to treat said Ga solution to decrease the concentration of the 
contained oxygen and then continue the growth. It is also 

possible to conduct the growth using the Ga solution with a high 
concentration of oxygen until the temperature reaches the 

prescribed temperature of 980°C or higher, and then, after 
switching the growth solution to a Ga solution with a low concentration 

of oxygen, continue the growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of manufacturing a GaP 
light emitting element substrate, and more precisely to a 
substrate (hereafter referred to as "GaP red light emitting 
element substrate") comprising a plurality of GaP layers formed 
on a GaP single crystal substrate which is used to manufacture 
GaP light emitting elements, and methods of manufacturing it. Light emitting elements such as light emitting diodes are 
obtained normally by layering a plurality of semiconductor layers 
on a semiconductor single crystal substrate to prepare a 
multi-layer semiconductor element substrate with a pn junction, 
and making it into elements. Of these, GaP red light emitting 
elements can be obtained by using a GaP red light emitting 
element substrate prepared by forming one or more layers of 
n-type and p-type GaP layers, one after another, on an n-type GaP 
single crystal substrate. GaP has the indirect transition-type band structure, and it 
does not emit red light when a pn junction is simply formed. 
Therefore, the p-type GaP layer(s) is doped with zinc (Zn) and 
oxygen (O) to form Zn-O pairs, which would be the emitting  
 
centers, in the p-type GaP layer(s). This GaP light emitting 
element emits red light which peak wavelength is approximately 
700 nm. As described thus far, the p-type GaP layer(s) of the GaP red 
light emitting element substrate is doped with Zn and O, and a 
higher Zn-O pair concentration would give light emitting elements 
with higher luminance. In order to do this, it is necessary to 
dope a large amount of O in this layer(s). However, there was 
a problem in that doping of a large amount of O gave rise to many 
precipitates of gallium oxide (Ga₂O₃) on and / or in the surface 
of the p-type GaP layer of the light emitting element substrate 
manufactured by the liquid phase epitaxial growth method, 
resulting in an increase in the ratio of surface failure due to 
the Ga₂O₃ precipitates. Therefore, the object of this invention is to provide a GaP 
red light emitting element substrate which a large amount of 
oxygen is doped in the p-type GaP layer(s), thus allowing the 
manufacture of high-luminance red light emitting elements, and 
which very few Ga₂O₃ precipitates develop on and / or in the p-type 
GaP layer(s), and methods of manufacturing said substrate. In order to solve the problem mentioned above, this invention, 
as described in Claim 1, provides a method of manufacturing 
a GaP red light emitting element substrate by forming, one after 
another, an n-type GaP layer(s),
