<ABSTRACT>
A method for preventing activated sludge from 
losing its settling ability that appears sometimes in 

the solid/liquid separation in an activated sludge 
treatment of an aqueous organic waste and causes the 

so-called bulking and scumming of the sludge, which 
method comprises addiing either (a) a nonionic and/or 

an anionic surfactant, (b) a combination of a nonionic 
surfactant with a cationic surfactant of a form of 

quaternary ammonium salt or (c) a combination of a 
nonionic surfactant and a cationic surfactant of a form 

of a quaternary ammonium salt with a cationic organic 
flocculant, to the activated sludge treatment system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
preventing activated sludge from losing its settling
ability that appears sometimes in the solid/liquid
separation in an activated sludge treatment of an
aqueous organic waste and causes the so-called bulking
and scumming of the sludge.An activated sludge treatment of an aqueous
organic waste is performed usually by admixing an
activated sludge to the waste to be treated, aerating
the mixed liquor in an aeration tank to subject the
organic matter in the waste to a biodegradation by
microorganisms in the activated sludge and separating
the sludge from the aerated mixed liquor in a settling
tank, whereupon the supernatant is discharged out of
the treatment system as a treated water, while the
separated sludge is partly returned to the aeration
tank as a return sludge and the remainder is exhausted
out of the system as an excess sludge. In such an
activated sludge treatment of an organic matter-containing
aqueous waste, the organic matter is 
subjected to a biodegradation by the activated sludge
in which certain bacteria such as Zoogloea etc., have
come to prevail over others. However, in some cases,
the nature of the raw waste and the conditions of the
sludge treatment may rather facilitate multiplication
of filamentous microorganisms, for example, filamentous
bacteria, such as Sphaerotilus etc., and actinomycetes
of the genus Nocardia, whereby the bulking or scumming
of the sludge is caused. A classification of
filamentous microorganisms found in an activated sludge
is proposed by D.H. Eikelboom ("Water Research" Vol. 9,
pp 365 - 388, Pergamon Press 1975). In the "bulked"
sludge, there is often observed a filamentous bacterium
which is named "Type 021N" by D.H. Eikelboom.Bulking is a phenomenon in which the sludge
becomes light and is broken up due to the multiplication
of filamentous microorganisms, whereby the
sludge loses its settling ability. When bulking
occurs, the separation of the sludge in the settling
tank becomes difficult and a part of the sludge will be
discharged out of the system with the treated water, so
that a sufficient amount of the return sludge is not
able to reserve and the biotreatment performance is
decreased.When actinomycetes of the genus Nocardia
multiplicate, there may occur, in addition to the
possible occurrence of the bulking phenomenon, scumming
in which a part of the sludge float up to form a scum
accompanied by foams which are formed by mycolic acid,
an ultrahigher fatty acid, whereby the settling ability 
of the sludge is

<CLAIMS>
A method for the treatment of aqueous organic waste
including filamentous bacteria and/or actinomycetes,

comprising aerating a mixed liquor comprising the waste and
activated sludge, and adding a non-ionic and/or

anionic surfactant; and allowing sludge to settle.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein 5 to 1,000 mg/l of the surfactant, is added to the mixed
liquor.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein a non-ionic surfactant and, as a
cationic surfactant, a quaternary ammonium salt, are added to the

mixed liquor.
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein 5 to 1,000 mg/l of the non-ionic surfactant
and 0.5 to 100 mg/l of the cationic surfactant are added to the mixed

liquor.
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein also a cationic organic flocculant is added to the mixed
liquor.
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein also 10 to 100 mg/l of a cationic organic
flocculant is added to the mixed

liquor.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
also an anti-foaming agent is added to the mixed liquor.
