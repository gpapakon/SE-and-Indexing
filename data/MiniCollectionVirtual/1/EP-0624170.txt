<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of producing by splitting off CO2, plastics containing amide groups, by reacting polyfunctional isocyanates, carboxylic acids plus, optionally, alcohols in the presence of tertiary amines, in particular hetero-aromatic amines. The hetero-aromatic amines preferably contain an additional hetero-atom and/or substituents with +I and/or +M effects. The reaction preferably starts at room temperature and can be used to prepare fine-celled foam materials with an acid number of less than 40 and a maximum gross density of 150 g/1 within short reaction times at room temperature and without using foaming agents.
