<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-rheological fluid coupling (11) including a stationary electromagnetic
coil (31) and cylindrical contact member (43) surrounding an input shaft (19), and in turn,

being surrounded by the output coupling assembly (15). Input (63,65) and output (29)
coupling members define a viscous shear chamber (71) disposed radially outward from the

coil (31). A drive member (21) extends radially from the input shaft (19) and includes an
annular portion (61) at least partially surrounding the coil (31) and driving the input

coupling member (63,65). The stationary coil (31) and contact member (43) eliminates
the need for electrical brushes, and the problems associated therewith, and the overall

arrangement of the coupling (11) results in only radial non-working air gaps, such that the
efficiency and repeatability of the device is substantially improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to viscous fluid couplings, and more particularly, to
such couplings in which the viscous fluid comprises a magneto-rheological fluid, according to the preamble of claim 1.Viscous fluid couplings have been in commercial use for many years. A typical use
is to drive the radiator cooling fan of a vehicle engine, wherein the engine is of the "north-south"
type, i.e., where the axis of the engine is oriented in the direction of the axis of the
vehicle. Such couplings are also commonly referred to as "viscous fan drives", and
although the present invention is not limited to use as a fan drive, the invention is
especially advantageous when used as a fan drive, and will be described in connection
therewith.In typical prior art viscous couplings, especially those used as fan drives, the
coupling includes both an operating chamber, where viscous fluid shear occurs, and a
reservoir chamber, in which viscous fluid is stored when it is not in the operating chamber.
In the prior art coupling, the relationship between output speed and input speed is
determined by the extent to which the operating chamber is filled with fluid. In most fan 
drive applications, the amount of filling of the operating chamber is determined by a
valving mechanism, which controls the position of a valve member in response to a sensed
temperature condition, such as local, ambient air temperature.There is an increasing demand for viscous fan drives in which the ratio of output
speed to input speed is determined by a remotely sensed temperature condition, such as the
"top tank" temperature in the radiator. In such a cooling system, it is desirable to sense
the remote temperature, generate a corresponding electrical signal, and transmit that signal
to the fan drive, where the signal is used to move a valve member, or somehow vary the
transmission of torque from the input coupling to the output coupling.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,898,266 and 4,898,267, both of which are assigned to the
assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference, teach viscous fluid
couplings in which torque transmission is varied by varying an electrostatic field impressed
upon a shear chamber containing an electroviscous fluid. Unfortunately, such
electroviscous fluids have not yet been developed to the point where such devices are
commercially operable and feasible.U.S. Patent No 4,920,929 discloses another general type of viscous coupling in
which the ratio of output to input varies in response to variations in an electrical
