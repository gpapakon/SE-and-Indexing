<ABSTRACT>
A citrus juicer having a base (10) enclosing a driving electric 
motor arranged to drive a pair of upstanding spindles (13,14) on 

top of each of which is a juicing cone (19,20), the juicing cones 
being arranged above a container (11) for the collection of 

juice, characterised in that the container (11) is attached to 
the base (10) so as to be readily removable therefrom for 

cleaning, a lid (25) arranged to extend over the juicing cones (19,20) 
and the container (11) hingedly removably attached to the 

container, the lid (25) being shaped internally to apply 
pressure to a half-citrus fruit placed on top of each said 

juicing cone on closure of the lid, the lid being moulded 
from plastic in a single piece, the arrangement being such 

that half of a citrus fruit can be placed on top of each 
juicing cone (19,20) and the lid hinged downwardly to press 

simultaneously the halve of the citrus fruit onto the 
juicing cones in order to cause juice to be extracted from 

them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to citrus juicers, that 
is to say to apparatus for extracting the juice from 
citrus fruit such as oranges. In the specification of United States patent 
2,017,960 is described a citrus juicer consisting of a 
base enclosing a driving electric motor arranged to drive 
a pair of upstanding spindles at the top of each of which 
is a juicing cone, each juicing cone being arranged above 
a container for the collection of juice, a receptacle 
arranged for the reception of a whole citrus fruit such as 
an orange adjacent the juicing cones, two inverted cup 
shaped members arranged one above each juicing cone, the 
cup shaped members being supported for vertical movement 
and a lever being provided whereby the cup shape members 
may be brought downwardly to press a half citrus fruit 
against each juicing cone, a knife being movable with the 
cup shaped members on movement of the lever being arranged 
so that as the cup shape members are brought down onto 
halves of fruit on the juicing cones the knife is brought 
down to cut in half the fruit in the receptacle. The 
apparatus described in that specification would be 
extremely expensive to manufacture and presents problems 
in cleaning the machine after use. The patent concerned issued in 1935 but so far as can 
be ascertained the apparatus described is not available in 
the market. The present applicant has recognised the merits of 
the construction described above and has devised 
advantageous improvements which are the subject of the 
present application. The principal object of the present invention is to 
provide a citrus juicer of a similar kind in which the 
shortcomings referred to above are overcome. The 
invention provides a citrus juicer that is relatively 
inexpensive to make and in which those parts that come  
 
into contact with citrus juice are readily removable for 
cleaning. The present invention consists in a citrus juicer 
comprising a base enclosing a driving electric motor 
arranged to drive a pair of upstanding spindles on top of 
each of which is a juicing cone, the juicing cones being 
arranged above a container for the collection of juice, 
characterised in that the container is attached to the 
base so as to be readily removable therefrom for cleaning, 
a lid arranged to extend over the juicing cones and the 
container and being hingedly removably attached to the 
container, the lid having internal means arranged to apply 
pressure to a half-citrus fruit placed on top of each said 
juicing cone on
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A citrus juicer comprising a base (10) enclosing a 
driving electric motor arranged to drive a pair of 

upstanding spindles (13, 14) on top of each of which is a 
juicing cone (19, 20), the juicing cones being arranged 

above a container (11) for the collection of juice, 
characterised in that the container (11) is attached to 

the base (10) so as to be readily removable therefrom for 
cleaning, a lid (25) arranged to extend over the juicing 

cones (19, 20) and the container (11) and being hingedly 
removably attached to the container (11), the lid (25) 

having internal means (28) arranged to apply pressure to a 
half-citrus fruit placed on top of each said juicing cone 

(19, 20) on closure of the lid, the last mentioned means 
(28) and the lid (25) being moulded from plastic in a 

single piece, the arrangement being such that half of a 
citrus fruit can be placed on top of each juicing cone 

(19, 20) and the lid (11) hinged downwardly to press 
simultaneously the halves of the citrus fruit onto the 

juicing cones (19, 20) in order to cause juice to be 
extracted from them. 
A citrus juicer as claimed in claim 1 wherein there 
is formed integrally with the said container an open 

cavity (24) for receiving a single citrus fruit, the lid 

(25) having a cutting blade (26) which when the lid (25) 
is closed extends downwardly into the open cavity (24), 

the blade (26) being arranged so that a fruit in the 
cavity is cut in half on closure of the lid (25). 
A citrus juicer as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
including switch means for controlling operation of the 

driving electric motor, displaceable means (34) arranged 
to control operation of said switch, said displaceable 

means (34) being arranged in relation to the lid (25) in 
such a manner that the switch is switched to an on 

position only when the lid (25) is at least partially 
 

closed. 
A citrus juicer as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein the said internal means (28) arranged to apply 

pressure to a half citrus fruit each consist of four 
internally arcuately shaped members adapted to fit around 

the surface of a half of a citrus fruit impaled on each 
said juicing cone. 
A citrus juicer as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein each juicing cone (19, 20) is surrounded by an 

annular perforated member (17, 18) acting to prevent the 
entry of coarse material and pips into the container (11).
