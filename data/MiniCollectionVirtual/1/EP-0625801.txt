<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of fabricating an ohmic electrode
suitable for use in compound semiconductor devices.Conventionally, an ohmic electrode of a gallium
arsenide (GaAs)-based compound semiconductor device is formed
on a GaAs-based semiconductor layer or a GaAs substrate by
subjecting a Ni/Au-Ge metallic layer to alloying treatment.
More specifically, an ohmic electrode can be formed, for
example, by depositing an Au-(12 wt.%)Ge layer, then a nickel
layer thereon by means of vacuum deposition process, and
alloying the resulting metallic layer by heating it at a
temperature range of from 400 to 450°C for a duration of 1 to
2 minutes.In the alloying treatment, the Au-Ge alloy is molten to
form a liquid phase at a temperature not lower than the
eutectic point of 356 °C. Because the surface of an n-type GaAs
compound semiconductor layer is unsaturated, gallium and
arsenic dissolve into the Au-Ge melt during the alloying
treatment. Thus is formed an alloy layer comprising, in
addition to an Au-Ga alloy, a Ni-As-Ge alloy which results from
arsenic, nickel, and germanium that are present in excess.
During lowering the temperature, that is, during the re-growth
of GaAs, germanium is incorporated into GaAs to occupy the 
vacancy sites of gallium (Ga) to form an n+ layer. Nickel plays
a role of absorbing gold and germanium to form a film of Ni-Au-Ge
alloy, and of preventing boring up of Au-Ge alloy. An
electrode material layer is deposited thereafter on the alloy
layer, and is etched into a desired shape to obtain a complete
ohmic electrode.An ohmic contact between the metallic Ni/Au-Ge layer
and the base layer, i.e., the GaAs-based semiconductor layer or
the GaAs-based substrate, can be formed by alloying the
metallic Ni/Au-Ge layer as described above. However, the heat
treatment for the alloying must be performed at a temperature
in the range of from 400 to 450 °C for a duration of 1 to 2
minutes. The temperature of alloying is sufficiently lower
than, for example, the crystal growth temperature for GaAs
considering that an MOCVD process is effected at about 800 °C.
Hence, alloying was believed to be free of problems, i.e., to
have no influence on ion implantation and other processes for
fabricating compound semiconductor devices.Considering the process for growing a semiconductor
layer of a compound consisting of a Group II and a Group VI
element of periodic table (hereinafter referred to simply as a
"Group II-VI compound semiconductor") on an n-type GaAs substrate,
however, the
