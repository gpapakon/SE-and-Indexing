<ABSTRACT>
This rail (1) is characterised in that it has at least one built-in skirting board (face board) (20A, 20B) to form a non-detachable single-piece assembly with this rail, connection between the skirting board and the rail being by means of articulation means (21, 22) able to make it possible for the skirting board to be folded up and down with respect to the vertical branch (4 or 5) of the rail (1) in order to make the means (23) for immobilising the panel (6) accessible, while allowing these, and the rail, to be hidden.

Track for fixing a partition panel (6) to the ground, 
joined one to the other after the panel has been placed in 

position by means of permanent securing means (23) running 
transversally from the exterior of the vertical branches 

(4, 5) of the track (1), which is U-shaped overall, so as 
to co-operate with a lower portion of the panel (6) 

located in the said track (1), characterised in that a 
plinth (20A, 20B) longitudinally covers at least one of the 

vertical branches (4, 5) of the track (1) in order to hide 
it and the permanent securing means (23) of the panel (6) 

and form an aesthetic joint between this latter and the 
ground, and the plinth (20A or 20B) is an integral part of 

the track (1) forming an inseparable monobloc unit 
therewith, these two being joined by coupling means (21, 

22) so that the plinth can be folded back from the 
corresponding vertical branch (4, 5) of the track to 

provide access to the permanent securing means (23) of the 
panel (6) yet also cover these and those of the track. 
Track as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
coupling means (21, 22) of the integrated plinth (20A, 20B) 

are arranged close to the top of the free longitudinal edge 
of the corresponding vertical branch (4, 5) of the said 

track (1). 
Track as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the 
coupling means (21, 22) of the integrated plinth (20A, 20B) 

are a flexible longitudinal zone produced by a locally 
thinner portion forming a hinge-film which is manufactured 

during a same process of moulding with the said track (1) 
and the plinth using a plastics material. 
Track as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the  
 

coupling means of the integrated plinth are a flexible 
longitudinal zone made from a less hard material than that 

of the material used for the track (1) and the plinth (20A, 
20B), the unit being produced during a same process of 

moulding using a plastics material that has dual hardness 
characteristics. 
Track as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the 
plastics material used to mould the unit comprising the 

said track (1) and the integrated plinth (20A, 20B) is a 
polyvinyl chloride in which a plastifying agent is 

incorporated level with the coupling zone so as to give 
this the desired flexibility. 
Track as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the integrated plinth (20A, 20B) has 

additional closing means (24) arranged on the one hand 
facing a vertical branch (4 or 5) of the track (1) and on 

the other on the internal face of a plinth (20A or 20B) to 
co-operate with each other when the plinth (20A or 20B) is 

folded back after the panel (6) has been fixed in the track 
(1), the said closing means being produced in conjunction 

with the track-plinth unit during a same moulding process. 
Track as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the 
closing means of the plinth (20A or 20B) are formed on the 

one hand by a first, elastically deformable lip (25) 
arranged on the internal face of the plinth (20A or 20B) 

close to the free longitudinal edge thereof and, on the 
other, by a second fixed lip (26) arranged conjugately to 

the first (25) close to the base of the vertical branch (4, 
5) of the track (1), the two lips (25, 26) being designe
d 
to co-operate with one another by an elastic ratchet action 

when the plinth is folded back.  
 
Track as claimed in one of the previous claims, 
characterised in that the free longitudinal edge of the 

integrated plinth (20A or 20B) is an elastically deformable 
flap (27 or 28) designed to conform to the ground (3) 

against which it will be applied. 
Track as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that the 
deformable flap (27 or 28) is made from a less hard 

material than that of the unit comprising the track (1) and 
the plinth (20A, 20B) which is made in a same process of 

moulding from a plastics material that has dual hardness 
characteristics. 
Track as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that each of its vertical branches (4, 5) 

has an integrated plinth (20A or 20B) to form a symmetrical 
unit, manufactured during a same moulding process.
