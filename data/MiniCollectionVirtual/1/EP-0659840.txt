<ABSTRACT>
Pigment compositions comprising an organic pigment whose particle surface is provided with a protective coating, characterised in that the coating comprises a metal phosphate complex in which the metal is selected from the group consisting of zirconium, titanium and mixtures thereof, and makes up from 0.5 to 100 % by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 40 % by weight and, in particular, from 5 to 40 % by weight, based on the pigment. The compositions are distinguished by outstanding properties, especially by the high gloss of the colorations obtained therewith, by high dispersion stability and heat stability, and by very good rheological characteristics of the printing inks or coating materials produced therewith by grinding. The plastics pigmented with the compositions of the invention are likewise distinguished by high heat stability and by a substantial lack of distortion in the plastics components.

A pigment composition comprising an organic
pigment whose particle surface is provided with a layer

of a protective coating, which coating consists of a
metal phosphate complex in which the metal is selected

from the group consisting of zirconium, titanium and
mixtures thereof, and the amount of said coating is

from 0.5 to 100% by weight, preferably from 5 to 40% by
weight, based on the pigment.
A pigment composition according to claim 1,
wherein the pigment is a pigment of the

diketopyrrolopyrrole, quinacridone, perylene,
anthraquinone, phthalocyanine, azo, isoindoline or

isoindolinone series.
A pigment composition according to claim 1,
wherein the pigment is a pigment of the

diketopyrrolopyrrole or quinacridone series.
A pigment composition according to claim 1,
which is additionally coated with a layer of an

aminoalkyl acrylate resin obtainable by
homopolymerization of a monomer of formula



wherein R

 is hydrogen or methyl and R
4
 and R
5
 are each
independently of the other hydrogen, methyl or ethyl 

and m is an integer from 1 to 6, or by copolymerization
of the same monomer with a monomer which is

copolymerizable with said same monomer.
A process for applying an adhesive coating of a
metal phosphate complex to the particle surface of an

organic pigment, using as said metal zirconium and/or
titanium, which comprises


a) dispersing the pigment with a Zr and/or Ti salt or
chelate complex in water or a lower alkyl alcohol,

or a mixture thereof, by conventional methods,

and
b) adding the aqueous solution of the compound
supplying the phosphate ions, with stirring,

in such amounts that from 0.5 to 100% by weight of
metal phosphate complex is formed, based on the

pigment, at a preferred molar ratio of metal to
phosphorus of between 0.25 and 0.75,

or dispersing the pigment first with the compound
supplying the phosphate ions and then adding the

aqueous solution of the metal salt or metal chelate
complex,

such that the Zr and/or Ti phosphate complex forms

in situ
 at temperatures between 20 and 80Â°C, preferably
at room temperature, on the particle surface of the

pigment and precipitates as a protective layer.
A process according to claim 5, wherein from 5
to 40% by weight of metal phosphate complex is formed,

based on the pigment.
A process according to claim 5, which comprises
first dispersing the pigment with the metal salt or 

metal chelate complex and then adding the solution of
the compound supplying the phosphate ions.
A process according to claim 5, which comprises
using a Zr or Ti salt or a complex selected from

zirconium sulfate, zirconium ammonium carbonate,
