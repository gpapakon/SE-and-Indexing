<ABSTRACT>
A central vehicle-information management center
gathers individual pieces of information on the state of a

vehicle on a real-time manner by: acquiring and gathering
pieces of information on the position of the vehicle from a

reflection signal reflected by an artificial satellite as a
result of reflection of a position signal transmitted by an

antenna provided on the vehicle to the artificial
satellite; and acquiring and gathering a signal reflected

by the artificial satellite as a result of reflection of a
signal used for representing information on control of the

vehicle or information on conditions of vehicle parts and
transmitted from the antenna to the artificial satellite or

transmitted by the vehicle through a wireless-communication
apparatus such as a DSRC (Dedicated Short Range

Communication) device or a cellular phone. As a result,
with such a central vehicle-information management center,

it is possible to provide a method and an apparatus, which
can be used for gathering information on a vehicle and

capable of continuously collecting detailed information on
the present state of a vehicle with a high degree of

reliability and in a real-time manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for gathering information on a movable body by
using a satellite communication system or another movable-body
communication system such as a ground-wave digital
communication system, a cellular phone and a DSRC
(Dedicated Short Range Communication) system.A car navigation system for displaying the present
position of a vehicle on a screen has been implemented and
becoming popular. In recent years, a communication
navigation system connecting a cellular phone to a car
navigation system has also been implemented.As a means for acquiring information on the state of
a vehicle, partial history data is created at inspection of
the vehicle at a car dealer and delivered to a complete-car
manufacturer or a car-part manufacturer through typically
wire communication instead of being created in a real-time
manner.As a means for acquiring information on the
condition of a vehicle, in a dealer, there is provided a
system for reporting partial history data at inspection of
the vehicle. Since the frequency of the gathering of 
information is low and requests for vehicle inspection to
be conducted at a dealer appointed by a complete-car
manufacturer are uncertain, however, it is difficult for
the complete-car manufacturer and a car-part manufacturer
to create information useful for marketing of each car type
and useful for statistical analyses and to feed back the
information to a design team. In addition, as a movable-body
communication technology, in order to gather and
manage data of each car type produced by the complete-car
manufacturer by using cellular phones, which become popular
at a fast pace, it is necessary to obtain the phone number
of each user. It is thus difficult to gather information
on a plurality of specific cars and to distribute
information in a collective manner.Thus, information on the present condition of a
vehicle is not collected continuously in a real-time manner.
Even if the information is collected continuously in a
real-time manner, the collected information is very limited
so that the utilization of the information cannot help
being said to be little. Continuous gathering of
information on the state of a vehicle is indispensable to
statistical analyses of the vehicle and the type of the
vehicle. If there are no statistics, subsequent diagnostic
analyses cannot be conducted as well. It is thus an object of the present invention
addressing the problems described above to provide a
vehicle-information gathering method and a
