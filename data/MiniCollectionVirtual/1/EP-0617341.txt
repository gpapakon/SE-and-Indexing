<ABSTRACT>
In an electrophotographic printer, an improved system for stripping copy sheets from 
a photoreceptor imaging belt which may be adversely life affected by mechanical wrapping 

stresses from wrapping around small radii supports over time, yet with the copy sheets 
desirably stripping from the photoreceptor belt at a small radius arcuate sheet stripping area of 

the photoreceptor belt. The imaging belt (10) is mounted only on large diameter supports 
(18,20) which do not wrap the belt in any small radii. The inside surface of the belt is 

temporarily engaged only during copy sheet printing, with a small radius stripping member 
(62) with sufficient force to only temporarily arcuately slightly deform the photoreceptor belt 

in a correspondingly small radius so as not to introduce substantial long lasting mechanical 
wrapping stresses in the belt but to define the desired small radius sheet stripping area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the stripping of copy sheets from an imaging surface in the
form of an endless belt, in an electrographic printing apparatus.Photoreceptor belts of copiers or printers are particularly susceptible to stresses from
deflections over long time periods because of their specialized photosensitive materials,
especially belts with plural layers of different materials. Photoreceptor belt properties are
necessarily maximized for imaging properties, etc., not stress resistance, unlike drive belts.
Some examples of Xerox Corporation U.S. patents discussing the problems of organic
photoreceptor belt flexibility and delamination from the small diameter belt supporting rollers
desired for copy sheet self-stripping (and/or for very small machines) include US-A-4,265,990;
4,937,117 and 4,786,570. Typical organic photoreceptors are particularly susceptible to stress at
the belt seam, where the two ends of the belt are welded or glued together to make the belt
loop.As xerographic and other copiers and printers increase in speed and workloads, and
become more automatic, it is increasingly important to provide longer life and more reliable
operation, and also to provide improved handling of the copy sheets. These sheets may have a
variety or mixture of sizes, types, weights, materials and conditions. Yet it is very desirable to
provide improved, minimal, misstripping or jamming rates, especially for unattended or remote
printers.The particular problems of stripping copy sheets from imaging surfaces after
electrostatic toner image transfer are well known in the art. Various types of sheet stripping
and/or detacking systems are known in the xerographic copier and printer art. The following
patent disclosures provide some examples. An effective combination of electrostatic
neutralizing (detacking) plus small radius arcuate deformation of the photoreceptor away
from the sheet for improved paper beam strength self-stripping is well established in the art as
the most desirable solution, used in most copier and printer products. The basic detack and
sheet beam strength stripping patent is US-A-3,998,536. US-A-5,177,543 further discusses
continuing sheet stripping problems in the art from photoreceptor belts, and suggests an
[undesirable] increase in background toner contamination to try to avoid such miss-strips.
Another teaching of, and suggestion for, this problem is in US-A-3,984,183, which teaches

<CLAIMS>
An electrographic printing apparatus including an imaging surface (10) in the form
of an endless belt supported for rotation around two or more belt supports (18, 20), and

including means for transferring developed images from the imaging surface to copy sheets
(58) at a transfer station (D), the transfer station including a sheet stripping member (62)

adapted to engage the belt between two of the belt supports, and the sheet stripping member
(62) having a belt-engaging radius smaller than the belt-engaging radii of the belt supports

(18, 20), characterised in that the sheet stripping member (62) is arranged to engage the belt
(10) only during operation of the apparatus for copy sheet printing, that when the sheet

stripping member is disengaged from the belt, the belt portion at the transfer station is
substantially linear, and that when the sheet stripping member engages the belt, it arcuately

deforms a portion of the belt around a minor segment thereof which is sufficiently long to
cause stripping of the copy sheet (58) from the belt.
An electrographic printing apparatus with a rotatable photoreceptor imaging belt
which is adversely life affected by mechanical wrapping stresses from wrapping the

photoreceptor belt around small radii supports over time, including means for stripping copy
sheet image substrates from the photoreceptor imaging belt at a sheet stripping area in which

said copy sheet image substrates are stripped from the outside surface of said photoreceptor
belt at a small radius arcuate sheet stripping area of said photoreceptor belt; and large radius

belt supports operatively supporting said photoreceptor belt for
rotation thereon, all of which belt supports have belt engaging radii large enough not to wrap

the belt in any small high belt stressing, radii; the stripping means including

a small radius stripping member of a substantially smaller belt engaging radius than
said belt supports;
an automatic camming system for temporarily engaging the inside surface of said
photoreceptor belt with said small radius stripping member only during copy sheet printing

with a stripping member of a smaller radius than any of said large radius supports with
sufficient engagement force to temporarily arcuately deform a small arc segment portion of

said photoreceptor belt in a correspondingly small radius to define said small radius arcuate
sheet stripping area at said portion of said photoreceptor belt so deformed by said small radius

stripping member; and
said automatic camming system automatically retracting said small radius stripping

member from said deforming engagement with said photoreceptor belt when said
electrophotographic printing apparatus is not in use.

member temporarily deforms said belt by substantially less than 45 degrees.
