<ABSTRACT>
An objective lens posture adjusting mechanism of an 
optical pickup capable of easily adjust the objective 

lens posture. In order to adjust an inclination angle of 
an objective lens about two axes relative to an optical 

system support base, an intermediate base is superposed 
upon the optical system support base via first 

cylindrical surfaces, an object lens support base is 
superposed upon the intermediate base via second 

cylindrical surfaces having a center axis not parallel to 
a center axis of the first cylindrical surfaces, and the 

inclination angle of the objective lens about the two 
axes is adjusted by relative rotations of the first and 

second cylindrical surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an
optical pickup of an optical disk drive, and more
particularly to an optical lens posture adjusting
mechanism for an optical pickup.An example of the structure of an optical pickup of
an optical disk drive is shown in Fig.5. Reference
numeral 1 represents a laser diode which emits a laser
beam. The laser beam emitted from the laser diode 1
passes through a diffraction grating 2, is reflected by a
beam splitter 3, and is incident upon a collimator lens
4. The laser beam is converted into a parallel beam by
the collimator lens 4, reflected by a mirror 5, and is
incident upon an objective lens 6.The laser beam incident upon the objective lens is
converged on a signal recording surface of an optical
disk 9. The laser beam applied to the optical disk 9 is
reflected by the signal recording surface, and becomes 
incident upon the beam splitter 3 via the objective lens
6, mirror 5, and collimator lens 4 along the pass
opposite to the incident laser beam. Most of the laser
rays incident upon the beam splitter 3 transmit the beam
splitter 3 and are incident upon a convex lens 7. The
laser beam is converged by the convex lens 7 onto a
light receiving surface of a photodiode 8 and the
information recorded on the optical disk 9 is read.In order to correctly read information by such an
optical pickup, it is necessary to make the objective
lens apply a laser beam to an optical disk in the
direction perpendicular to the recording surface thereof
and be reflected by the recording surface in the
perpendicular direction, and to make the reflected laser
beam be converged to the photodiode 8. To this end, the
optical axis of a laser beam reflected by the objective
lens is required to be coincident with the optical axis
of a laser beam guiding optical system. An example of a
conventional objective lens posture adjusting mechanism
is shown in Fig.4. Reference numeral 10 represents an
optical system support base which supports an optical
system excepting an objective lens. An objective lens
support base 11 is mounted with a printed circuit board
13 by screws. The printed circuit board 13 resiliently
supports a lens holder 6a by means of four resilient 
members 14.Two pairs of confronting yokes 11b and 11c are
mounted on the objective lens support base 11. Magnets
12 are mounted on the yokes 11c. The objective lens 6 is
secured to the lens holder 6a, and the yokes 11b are
inserted into holes formed in the lens holder 6a. A
tracking coil and a focussing coil for interacting with a
mag
