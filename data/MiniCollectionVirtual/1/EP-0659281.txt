<ABSTRACT>
A new mirror structure (18) is based upon a composite resin laminate. The mirror surface (20) is provided by a gel coat resin layer (8) that has been applied to a forming tool (2) which has an optical quality surface (4), and a shape complementary to the desired mirror shape. The gel coat resin layer is cured so that it replicates the optical quality surface of the forming tool, and a rigid composite backing (10, 12, 14, 16) is then built up over its rear surface. A reflective metal coating (34, 42) is applied to the mirror's resin surface, either with a conventional vacuum deposition or with a new process. In the new process the microporous resin surface (20) is first degreased and cleaned, followed by the application of a bonding material (28) which extends into the resin micropores (22), and a conventional Brashear process to precipitate a silver coating (34, 42) onto the resin. The metal coating can be applied either after the resin layup has been completed, or it can be integrated into the layup process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITE MIRROR AND FABRICATION METHOD WITH PRECIPITATED REFLECTIVE COATINGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention relates to reflective mirrors and fab¬ rication methods therefore, and more particularly to mir- rors with a composite resin structure and a precipitated reflective coating.Description of the Related ArtMirrors are conventionally formed from glass or plas- tic coated with a reflective surface. Another technique involves stretching a thin film of aluminized mylar over the opening of a pressurized chamber. In this practice, a partial vacuum or positive pressure is used to shape the aluminized mylar surface to the desired contour. All three types of mirrors can be quite expensive when large dimen¬ sions and/or a high quality surface are required.Glass mirrors require lengthy grinding and polishing to obtain a high quality surface; this is not only time- consuming but also difficult when aspheric curved shapes are required, such as for parabolic reflectors. Glass mir¬ rors are quite fragile, and accidents during handling, in¬ stallation and maintenance cause major economic losses. Also, when it is desired to edge-butt a number of mirrors together to form a larger overall reflective surface, the edges of the glass segments are very susceptible to chip¬ ping. This results either in noticeable gaps between adja- 

cent segments, or the necessity to stagger or inset and overlap adjacent segments; both of these approaches are visually distracting. For complicated surface geometries, very expensive specialized grinding and polishing equipment that is not widely available is required. In addition, glass mirrors are relatively heavy for a given reflective area.The thermal forming of a plastic sheet, typically about 1.25-2.5cm thick, involves heating and stretching the sheet over a non-optical quality forming tool and then glu¬ ing a ribbed support structure onto its opposite side to provide rigidity. The surface of the stretched sheet must next be extensively ground and polished. The plastic mir¬ ror surface is not particularly durable, which can result in a limited lifetime for this type of mirror. Further¬ more, since the thermal forming process is not consistently uniform over the full mirror surface, producing a curved plastic mirror without grinding and polishing has not been technically or economically successful to date. Vacuum formed aluminized mylar requires an active pump, sensor and servo system to maintain the proper shape. The surface of this film is much less
