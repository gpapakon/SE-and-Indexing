<ABSTRACT>
A closure device for hygiene articles, particularly a diaper closure, comprises an elastic band (7) between two parts of the article that are to be connected and at least one connecting element for the reversibly releasable connection of the band (7) to at least one of the two parts of the article that are to be connected (incontinence diaper 1). The connecting element comprises a support (10, 11) which reinforces the elastic band (7) in a part-region (terminal regions 8, 9) and renders it inelastic there. The support is provided with a self-adhesive element (self-adhesive strip 12, 13) for the reversibly releasable connection of the band (7) to the article (incontinence diaper 1).

A closure device for hygienic articles, such as incontinent briefs, children's
diaper pants, incontinent pads or the like, for joining to each other

two portions of the hygienic article, in particular a diaper closure for joining
the front portion (4) to the rear portion (3) of a diaper (1) in the vicinity

of the lateral sides of the hips, comprising

an elastic band (7, 7') between the portions (4, 3), to be joined, of the
article (1); and
at least one connecting element for the reversibly releasable connection
of the band (7, 7') with at least one of the two portions (4, 3), to be

joined, of the article (1),

the at least one connecting element comprising a layer (10, 11, 10', 11')
which rigidifies a partial area of the elastic band (7, 7'), making it inelastic,

and on which a self-adhesive element (12, 13, adhesive layer 25) is
mounted for the reversibly releasable connection of the band (7) with the

article (1), 
characterized in that
 the respective layer (10, 11) extends from
one side (18) of the elastic band (7) onto the second side (20) thereof

around the end (19) of the band (7), and in that the self-adhesive element is
a self-adhesive tape (12, 13) joined to the rigidifying layer (10, 11) on the

one hand and to be reversibly releasably connected with the article (1) on
the other.
A closure device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a layer (10,
11, 10', 11') is disposed in the two end portions (8, 9, 8', 9') of the elastic

band (7, 7') so that repeated reversibly releasable connection of the closure
device as a re-usable fastening system with disposable hygienic articles is

possible. 
A closure device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the rigidifying
layer (10, 11, 10') consists of a tape of plastic film (16, 16') or a

paper tape (26, 26') which are non-extensible and glued on the band (7, 7').
A closure device according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the tape of
plastic film (16, 16') or the paper tape (26, 26') is durably glued on the band

(7, 7'') by means of a thermally activable hot-melt-type adhesive (adhesive
layer 17) or a self-adhesive layer (27).
A closure device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the layer
(11') consists of a cold-curing or thermoplastic coating (24).
A closure device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that

the self-adhesive element is formed by an adhesive layer (25, 25') directly
applied on the respective layer (10', 11').
A closure device according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that

the self-adhesive tape (12, 13) is reversibly releasably joined to the rigidifying
layer (10, 11).
A closure device according to claim 1, 4 and/or 7, 
characterized in that

the adhesive layer (17) for joining the tape of plastic film (16, 16') or the
paper tape (26, 26') to the band (7, 7''), the coating (22) of the self-adhesive

tape (12, 13) and/or the adhesive layer (25, 25') each consist of hot-melt-type
adhesives which are applied by rotational casting serigraphy. 
A closure device according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that

the elastic band (7, 7', 7'') consists of a rubber tape, a elastic nonwoven, an
elastic lattice structure or an elastic film.
A closure device according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that

rigidifying layers (tapes of plastic film 16', paper tapes 26') are applied to
the respective end (19) on the first lengthwise side (18) as well as on the

second lengthwise side (20), these rigidifying layers (tapes of plastic film
16', paper tapes 26') being designed differently on these two sides so that

varying adhesive strengths are obtained for the self-adhesive tape (13) to be
applied thereto.
