<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for direct bonding of silicon wafers, which allows, even in the case of clearly inferior surface roughness of the wafers and in the case of a high number of contaminating particles, satisfactory bonding of the wafers, and extremely high clean-room requirements need therefore not be satisfied.

<CLAIMS>
Process for manufacturing a stack, comprising the steps of

a) activating by hydrophilation the surfaces of the
silicon wafers (1) to be bonded,
b) cleaning the activated wafers (1) by rinsing with a
rinsing fluid,
c) inserting the still-wet wafers (1) into a suitable
stacking apparatus,
d) pressing the stack,
e) inserting the stack into a heating apparatus and
heating the stack in an inert gas atmosphere at a

temperature of 110 to 300°C,
f) growing a thermic oxide layer on the edges of the
wafers (1) in an oxidation apparatus in an

H
2
O atmosphere at an elevated temperature, whereby the
silicon wafers are rigidly directly bonded together on

the peripheral surfaces,

characterized in that

the pressing in step d) is performed in an preheated press
form at an preheating temperature between 110 and 300°C,
in step e) the stack together with the press form is
inserted into the heating apparatus and the stack is freed

from the stacking apparatus before inserting the stack into
the oxidizing apparatus.
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterized in that in 
the activating step a) the silicon wafers to be bonded are

provided with a thermic oxide layer that is subsequently
removed.
Process in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the pressing in step c) is carried out in the range of

1.96 x 10
5
 to 9.8 x 10
5
 N/m
2
 (2-10 kp/cm
2
), preferably at
4.9 x 10
5
 N/m
2
 (5 kp/cm
2
), and that the preheating
temperature lies between 110 and 300°C, preferably is 130°C.
Process in accordance with any one of the Claims 2 to 3,
characterized in that the inert gas in step e) is nitrogen

or argon, and the temperature of the heating apparatus is
110 to 300°C, preferably 130°C.
Process in accordance with any one of the Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the growing of the thermic oxide layer

in step f) occurs at a temperature between 950 and 1200°C,
preferably 1000°C.
Process in accordance with any one of the Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that, if the silicon wafers to be bonded

contain bores, the dimensions of these bores can be altered
after bonding of the wafers by a further oxidation process

or by removal of the oxide and renewed oxidation.
Use of wafer stacks in accordance with any preceeding Claim
as guiding plates for probes.
