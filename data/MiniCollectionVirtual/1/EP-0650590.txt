<ABSTRACT>
A disposable cuvette (10) is molded of rigid transparent plastic resin that is impervious to liquids to be handled within it. The cuvette (10) has a rectangular cross section. Identical side walls (45) extend between upper and lower ends of each cuvette, the upper end (52) being open for reception of liquids and the lower end being closed. Recessed optical surface areas (48-50) at the lower end are perpendicular to one another for optical testing of the cuvette contents. An elongated cartridge (40) holds a stack of abutting cuvettes (10) to facilitate their handling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This disclosure pertains to a cuvette designed for use in a clinical chemistry analyzer 
for the testing of patient samples, such as blood or urine. Automated analyzers have been developed for biochemical analysis of patient 
samples, such as whole blood, serum, urine, plasma and cerebral spinal fluid. Such analyzers 
carry out tests for assays in defined or random sequences of operations designed for efficient, 
high volume test procedures. They typically involve use of a reaction turntable that holds 
mixtures of reagents and samples within receiving cuvettes. Liquid materials are inserted into 
the cuvettes from a movable pipette. They are mixed and centrifuged for optical analytical 
test purposes. Much of such equipment is geared to very high volume test procedures. In such 
analyzers, the cuvettes are generally multi-compartment elements that partially or completely 
meet the requirements of a turntable. Many of these cuvettes are reusable. German Patent Application No. DE 31 04796 Al, published on 9 September 1982, 
discloses multiple cell cuvettes, wherein multiple openings are provided in each cuvette 
structure for reception of individual chemicals. Fig. 4 shows inclined cuvette cells having 
optical pathways toward their lower ends. U.K Patent Application No. GB 2 049 930 A, published on 31 December 1980, 
discloses a cell or cuvette made as an individual cell having three interconnected chambers 
for a sample, a reagent, and a mixture for photometric measuring purposes. The three 
interconnected chambers are at angles to one another to facilitate use of the cuvette in a 
centrifugal analyzer. U.S. Patent No. 3,718,439, issued on February 27, 1973, discloses a photometric 
cuvette assembly including multiple chambers that are inserted within an analyzer for 
incubation and photometric measurements. The cuvette holds multiple samples and is not 
designed for centrifugal usage. Individual cuvettes are also used on such turntables. They have assumed the form of 
vertical containers similar to cylindrical or rectangular test tubes. The present invention provides a cuvette as set out in claim 1 hereinafter, and a 
cuvette package as set out in claim 6. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the 
drawings in which:- 
Fig. 1 is a side elevation view of a cuvette; Fig. 2 is a top view;  
 Fig. 3 is a sectional elevation view taken along line 3-3 in Fig. 2; Fig. 4 is a front elevation view of a loaded cuvette cartridge; Fig. 5 is a transverse sectional view through a

<CLAIMS>
A cuvette (10) designed for use as a disposable item; 

the cuvette (10) being integrally molded from rigid liquid impervious 
material in a hollow rectangular cross sectional configuration and comprising: 
two parallel side walls (45) arranged in transversely spaced vertical 
positions extending between opposed ends of the cuvette (10), each side wall 

(45) having top and bottom edges and two end edges (36, 37) arranged across 
the respective ends of the cuvette (10); 
one end of the cuvette (10) having an opening (52); 
the remaining end of the cuvette (10) being closed by an end wall formed 
across the two side walls (45); 
a top wall (46) joining the end wall and the respective top edges of the 
two side walls (45); 
a bottom wall (47) joining the end wall and the respective bottom edges 
of the two side walls (45); and 
top and bottom optical surface areas (48, 50) provided at said remaining 
end of the cuvette for transmission of light during optical testing of cuvette 

contents; 
the cuvette being characterized by: 
the cuvette being designed for use in an angularly inclined installed 
position within a complementary turntable; 
the opening (52) being formed by angular edges (38) that intersect the 
top edges of the respective side walls (45); 
the end edges (36, 37) of each side wall (45) being perpendicular to said 
top and bottom edges, said cuvette ends being for abutting one another as successive cuvettes are pushed 

in end-to-end positions in a direction (60) parallel to said top and bottom edges 
to facilitate insertion of new cuvettes from the center of the turntable and 

ejection of spent cuvettes from its periphery in a feedthrough arrangement 
wherein a preceding cuvette is serially pushed from the turntable as a new 

cuvette takes its place and is installed within the turntable; 
each cuvette handling a single mixture of sample and reagent for analytical 
purposes; 
said angular edges (38) intersecting said top edges and end edges (36) 
across said one end of the cuvette (10) to form the elongated opening (52) 

providing an open access area to the interior of the installed cuvette (10) that 
does not permit splashing of fluids as they are delivered through a vertical  

 
pipette, whereby said angular edges (38) of opening (52) assume substantially 

horizontal orientations to permit entrance of the tip of a vertical pipette into 
said one end of the cuvette (10) when the cuvette (10) is positioned within a 

turntable with said top and bottom edges of the side walls (45) inclined at an 
angle to the horizontal. 
The cuvette as claimed in claim 1, further characterized by:

by the opening (52) extending completely across said one end of the cuvette 

(10) between said side walls (45) and intersecting said top and bottom walls (46, 
47). 
The cuvette as claimed in any of claims 1-4, further characterized 
by:
 
   a detent (51) formed along the bottom wall (47) of the cuvette (10) for 

yieldably holding the cuvette (10) within a receiving compartment of a turntable. 
A cuvette package which contains a plurality of the cuvettes as 
claimed in any of claims 1-5, the cuvette package being further characterized by: 


an elongated cartridge (40) facilitating storage, handling and insertion of 
stacked cuvettes (10) and being for use in a chemical analyzer; 
the cartridge (40) being formed from an open-ended C-shaped channel 
(41) which is dimensioned to house a stack of cuvettes (10) arranged in identical 

parallel positions with the respective top and bottom walls (46, 47) of adjacent 
cuvettes (10) abutting one another and with their respective end edges (36, 37) 

aligned along the length of the stack side;  
 
first inwardly bent stop means (42) located within the cartridge (40) in 
engagement with one end of a stack of cuvettes (10) for limiting motion of the 

stack of cuvettes (10) in a first direction along the length of the cartridge (40); 
and 
second inwardly bent stop means (43) located within the cartridge (40) 
adjacent to one end thereof, the second inwardly bent stop means (43) being 

in engagement with the remaining end of a stack of cuvettes (10) for resisting 
motion of the stack of cuvettes (10) in an opposite direction along the length 

of the cartridge (40). 
The cuvette package of claim 6 wherein the cartridge (40) is 
additionally characterized by being double-ended and holding two stacks of 

cuvettes (10) that face oppositely at its respective ends; 

the first inwardly bent stop means (42) being located near the center of
