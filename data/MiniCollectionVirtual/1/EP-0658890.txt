<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetooptical 
recording medium with overwrite capabilities and a 
magnetooptical reproduction method for using such a 
magnetooptical recording medium. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to a process for writing over 
existing or previously recorded information on a 
magnetooptical recording medium by irradiating the medium 
while modulating pulses of a laser beam in accordance with 
the information to be recorded thereon, without modulating 
the orientation or strength of the magnetic recording bias 
field Hb. As used herein, the term "overwrite" refers to the 
action of recording new information on a recording medium 
without first erasing existing or previously recorded 
information. Thus, it is necessary that the previous 
information not be reproduced. More specifically, the 
term "overwrite" as used herein refers to the described 
process of writing over the previously recorded 
information on a magnetooptical recording medium. Recently, there has been a great effort to develop 
optical recording and reproduction methods, as well as 
recording devices, reproduction devices and recording 
media that can be used with these methods, which satisfy 
the need for high density, large capacity, high access 
speed and high recording and reproduction speeds. In 
particular, among the wide range of optical recording and 
reproduction methods, the magnetooptical recording and 
reproduction method has the most appeal because of the 
unique benefit of the method wherein information that is 
recorded on a magnetooptical recording medium can be 
erased and new information recorded thereon. 
Additionally, the process may be repeated many times, thus 
allowing the magnetooptical recording medium to be reused.  A magnetooptical recording medium used in a 
magnetooptical recording and reproduction method has a 
magnetic layer or layers as a recording layer, generally 
applied on a protective substrate. The magnetic layer 
comprises, for example, amorphous GdFe, GdCo, GdFeCo, 
TbFe, TbCo, TbFeCo, and the like. Concentric or spiral 
tracks are formed on the recording layer, and data is 
recorded on the tracks. In the present specification, 
either the orientation of the magnetic field of "upward" 
or "downward" with respect to the surface of the recording 
layer is defined as the "A direction," with the opposite 
orientation becoming the "non-A direction." Information to be recorded on the magnetooptical 
disk is digitized beforehand, and the information is 
recorded
