<DESCRIPTION>
 ALICYCLIC DIAMINE FUNGICIDESField of the inventionThis invention is in the field of the control of fungal infection in plants.Description of the prior artThe effect of compounds which interfere with polyamine metabolism on the growth of the fungus Botrvtis cinerea has been investigated, Smith ___ __±. , J- Gen. Microbiol. 136, 985 (1990). This work demonstrated that difluoromethylornithine, (DFMO) inhibition of fungal growth could be reversed with the addition of putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and sper ine. "Butenedia ine" itself caused some inhibition of fungal growth but significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of DFMO. Summary of the inventionWe have now discovered that certain alicyclic diamines exhibit useful antifungal activity.Accordingly, the invention provides the use of a compound having the general formula (1):wherein R1 , R2, R3 and R4 which may be the same or different represent hydrogen atoms or alk l groups of 1-6 carbon atoms or NR R2 and/or NR3R4 together represent a heterocyclic group having 5 or 6 ring atoms, the dashed line represents a double bond, W represents a saturated or ethylenically unsaturated divalent hydrocarbyl group required to complete a cycloalkane, cycloalkene or cycloalkadiene ring of 3 to 6 ring atoms, preferably 4 to 6 ring atoms, and from 0 to 2 double bonds, in the form of a free base or acid addition salt tolerable to plants, as a plant fungicide. 

Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsOne class of preferred compounds of formula (1) is those wherein W completes a cycloalkane or cycloalkene ring of 4 to 6 ring atoms. W represents preferably a group having the formula - (CH2)n - wherein n is from 2 to 4 or a group -CH -CHyR5== CHyR6-CH2- wherein y is 0 or 1 and when y is 0 the dashed line represents a double bond and R- and R" which may be the same or different represent hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially methyl groups. R1, R2, R3 and R4 are preferably alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially methyl, or hydrogen atoms.One particularly preferred class of compounds for use as a plant fungicide is trans -N.N.N' ,N'-tetramethyl or -tetraethyl-1 ,2-bis(aminomethyl)cyclobutane [better named trans-1 ,2-bis(methylaminomethyl or ethylaminomethyDcyclobutane] and also 1 ,2-bis(methylaminomethyl or ethylaminomethyl)cyclohexa-l ,4-diene.Others are the primary amines, (R1 , R2, R3 and R4 are all hydrogen). Within this group, particularly preferred compounds are 1 ,2-bis(aminomethyl)-4,5-dimethylcyclohexa-l ,4-diene and 1
