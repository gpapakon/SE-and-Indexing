<ABSTRACT>
A light shielding magazine (1) includes a pair of holders (3,4) 
pivotable relative to 

each other for receiving a film cartridge (50). The film cartridge (30) 
includes a film feed 

opening (51) and a pivotable light shield (53) provided for the film 
feed opening to 

prevent entry of ambient light and to allow passage of a film (52) 
through the film 

feed opening. One of the holders (3) defines a cover portion (C) for 
covering the film 

feed opening when the light shielding magazine (1) is mounted on the 
film cartridge (50), 

to prevent entry of ambient light to the film feed opening (51) and to 
allow passage 

of the film fed out through the film feed opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light shielding
apparatus for a film cartridge having a
light shield movable between a closed position and an open position. The light
shield, in the closed position, prevents entry of ambient light through a film
feed opening and, in the open position, allows passage of a film through the
film feed opening.A well-known holder of photographic film has a film rolled on a spool and
enclosed in a cover. The cover defines a film feed opening light-shielded with
patches of velvet or the like, through which the film may be drawn out.This type of film holder is loaded into a camera, with the leader of the film
drawn out through the film feed opening, for use in photo-taking with the
camera.A light shielding magazine for this type of film holder
is known from US-A-3,568,587.As distinct from the film holder having the above construction, a novel film
cartridge has been conceived. As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, this film cartridge 50
may be loaded into a camera, with a film 52 including its leader completely
contained in the cartridge 50. Thus, an operation to load the film cartridge 50
into the camera may be effected free of error.With this novel film cartridge 50, film 52 may be fed out through the film
feed opening 51 simply by rotating a spool 54 of the film cartridge 50.Moreover, this film cartridge 50 includes, instead of velvet or the like, a light
shield 53 for preventing entry of ambient light into the film cartridge 50. The
light shield 53 is mounted in the film cartridge 50 to be pivotable about a 
pivotal axis 50a in directions indicated by arrows H to open and close a path of
the film 52.Where velvet or the like is used, surfaces of the film 52 could have scratches
or other flaws due to dust or the like adhering to the film surfaces and patches
of velvet or the like after passing through the film feed opening 51 a plurality of
times. Such inconvenience may be avoided with the novel construction. The
film 52, after being developed, may be returned as contained in the film cartridge
50 to the customer.When the above film cartridge 50 is loaded into a film developing device to
have the film developed, the leader of the film 52 must be drawn out of the film
cartridge 50 in advance. To drawn the film 52 out of the film cartridge 50, the
light shield 53 must be opened. Then, ambient light could enter the film
cartridge 50 through a gap provided by the light shield 53 in the open position.To avoid entry of ambient light, it has been conventional practice to draw the
leader of

A light shielding apparatus with a loading section (A) arranged to be mounted on a
film cartridge (50) of the type including a film feed opening (51)

and an openable/closable light shield (53), the light shield (53), in a closed
position thereof, preventing entry of ambient light through the film feed

opening (51) and, in an opened position thereof, allowing passage of a film
through the film fee opening (51):

      wherein

   said loading section (A) includes:
