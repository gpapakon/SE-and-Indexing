<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus having a receipt
interface I/F (17), a hard disk (16, 16a, 41), and a

printer section (12). The receipt interface I/F
receives pages of image data transmitted and a partial

print request signal requesting that only a part of the
image data be printed, both transmitted through a

communication line. The hard disk stores both the
image data and the partial print request signal. The

printer section prints a part of the image data stored
in the hard disk, in response to the partial print

request signal that the receipt interface I/F has
received.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus, such as a shared printer and a digital printing system, which preferably receive data from a plurality of clients through, for example, a local area network (LAN) or the like.Recently, more and more office automation (OA) apparatuses have been connected to a LAN and used. Personal computers (PCs) and the like are also connected to a LAN, and data is exchanged between them. In many cases, a plurality of PCs shares one printer, not each PC having one printer connected to it. Each PC may receive data from any other PC in the network and transmit it to the shared printer in the network, whereby the shared printer prints the data. Another PC called a "server" is provided in the network to control data that is to be transmitted to the shared printer.Upon receipt of pieces of print data from a plurality of PCs, the server stores them in a queue. The printer then prints the pieces of data sequentially, i.e. in the order they have been input to the queue. Namely, the printer performs a so-called "first in, first out" process.Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 10-11234 discloses the technique of storing data in a queue and processing, thereby to alter the setting of particular print data.More specifically, one printer is connected to two or more PCs by a LAN. The printer can therefore receive pieces of print data from the plurality of PCs. Thus, one printer is shared by a plurality of PC users. In addition, the printer and the PCs can be arranged more freely than otherwise. For example, each PC user can put the PC on his or her desk, while the shared printer can be installed at any place the PC users have agreed on.A problem will arise, however, if the printer and the PC are arranged so. Some users may have their PCs located relatively near the printer, but some others inevitably have their PCs located far from the printer. The PC users of the latter group have to walk a long distance to take the printed sheets at the shared printer.To make matters worse, the user may find that the printed sheets are of lower quality than he or she really wants. For example, the hatching over some printed characters in a word-processed document may happen to be darker or lighter than is desired. In this case, the user needs to print the data again and, hence, must walk back to his or her PC. The user must reset the various print instructions on the PC, then push the print button, and walk again all the way to the shared printer to take the new printed sheets.Thus,

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus (1) comprising:

receiving means (17) for receiving a plurality of pages of image data transmitted through a communication line and for receiving a partial print request signal requesting that only a part of the image data be printed; and
storage means (16, 16a, 41) for storing the image data and the partial print request -signal, both received at the receiving means;
first printing means (12) for trial printing on a paper sheet (6), in response to the partial print request signal stored in the storage means (16, 16a, 41), a part of the image data and an image (7) indicating that the trial printed data is a part of the image data; and
second printing means (12) for printing all pages of the image data stored in the storage means, upon receiving an all-page print instruction from a user through a control panel (20) provided on the image forming apparatus after the first printing means has printed the part of the image data, said all-page print instruction demanding that the image data be printed in a specific fashion.
An image forming apparatus (1) according to claim 1, wherein the image forming apparatus (1) is adapted to receive the partial print request signal from a personal computer (2) having a window (101) providing a check button (109) adapted to designate the pre-print display mode of trial printing.
An image forming apparatus (1) according to claim 1 or 2, further comprising:

transfer means (17) for transferring data representing the specific fashion to a data processing device which has transmitted the image data to the image forming apparatus through the communication line, after the second printing means (12) has printed all pages of image data.
An image forming apparatus (1) according to any preceding claim, wherein:

the first printing means (12) is adapted to print, in color, the part of the image data stored in the storage means (16, 16a, 41); and
the second printing means (12) is adapted to print, in color, all pages of the image data stored in the storage means, upon receiving an all-page color print instruction from the user
 through the control panel (20) provided on the image forming apparatus, after the first printing means has printed the part of the image data in color.
An image forming apparatus (1) according to claim 4, wherein:

the first printing means (12) is adapted to print the part of the image data in color in response to the partial print request signal stored in the storage means (16, 16a, 41), upon receiving a partial color print instruction from the user through the control panel (20) provided on the image forming apparatus.
