<ABSTRACT>
A device for reducing paper, in particular valuable papers, 
such as bank notes, said device being provided 

with a reducing device (9,11) as 
well as with a conveyor belt (3) for supplying the paper to the reducing 

device, whereby the at least substantially 
horizontally extending conveyor 

belt (3) is supported by a cabinet-like frame (1), 
which accommodates the reducing 

device, which is at least largely positioned under said conveyor belt. 
The discharge end of the conveyor belt (3) 

is positioned above an opening (8) 
provided in an upper wall of the cabinet-like frame, under which said 

reducing device (9,11) is positioned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for reducing paper,
in particular valuable papers, such as bank notes, said device being
provided with a reducing device as well as with an at least substantially
horizontally extending conveyor belt for supplying the paper to the
reducing device, which is at least largely positioned in a cabinet-like
frame under said conveyor belt, the discharge end of the conveyor belt
being positioned above an opening provided in an upper wall of the cabinet-like
frame, under which said reducing device is positioned.By such a device, which is known from EP-A1-0.434.975
the material to be shredded is passed between two rollers provided with
cutting blades. When the known device is used for reducing a relatively
thick bundled stack of paper, such as for example a bundled stack of bank
notes, it is not possible to reduce the banknotes to relatively very small
parts. This is necessary since otherwise it is possible to reconstruct
the bank notes, which is of course unwanted.From GB-A-2.198.681 a device for reducing paper is
known, wherein the material to be shredded is passed, via a conveyor
belt 26, between two rollers provided with cutting blades, one roller being
disposed above the other. When this known device is used for reducing a
relatively thick bundled stack of papers, such as for example a bundled
stack of bank notes, this bundle will become stuck between the rollers
provided with cutting blades. The conveyor belt will push more and more
paper against the rollers, which will even accelerate the jamming of the
rollers.The object of the invention is to provide a device for
reducing paper, which has a compact construction and which is suitable
for shredding relatively thick bundles of paper.In order to achieve this objective the invention is
characterized in that the conveyor belt is supported by a cabinet-like
frame, which accomodates the reducing device, said reducing device
comprising a pre-cutting device and a main cutting device, which are
arranged in a substantially horizontal side-by-side relationship.The pre-cutting device will cut up the paper to be
reduced into strips, whilst the main cutting device will cut up the strips
into shreds. Because the pre-cutting device and the main cutting device 
are arranged in a horizontal side-by-side relationship under the conveyor
belt, a compact construction is obtained.The reducing device is provided with two rollers
provided with cutting blades, which are arranged in side-by-side
relationship under the opening provided in the frame,

<CLAIMS>
A device for reducing paper, in particular valuable
papers, such as bank notes, said device being provided with a reducing

device as well as with an at least substantially horizontally extending
conveyor belt for supplying the paper to the reducing device, which is

at least largely positioned in a cabinet-like frame under said conveyor
belt, the discharge end of the conveyor belt being positioned above an opening

provided in an upper wall of the cabinet-like frame, under which said
reducing device is positioned, characterized in that the conveyor belt

is supported by the cabinet-like frame, which accomodates the reducing
device, said reducing device comprising a pre-cutting device and a main

cutting device, which are arranged in a substantially horizontal side-by-side
relationship.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the driving mechanism of the pre-cutting device is positioned undee said

conveyor belt.
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that said pre-cutting device is connected, by means of a duct, to the main

cutting device positioned under the conveyor belt, which main cutting
device is in turn connected to a fan.
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that
said fan is positioned under said conveyor belt, between said pre-cutting

device and said main cutting device.
A device according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in
that the discharge duct of the fan is connected to a cyclone separating

device positioned beside the cabinet-like frame, from which the finely
cut material may be supplied to a bag suspended under the device.
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that
said bag is suspended from a weighing device, which turns of the device

when a predetermined weight of the bag and its contents is exceeded.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the conveyor belt is surrounded by a closed cabinet,

to which access can be gained via a closable opening near the supply end
of the belt.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that means are provided for moving the belt in steps

during loading of the belt. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the drive of the belt is synchronized with the drive

of the pre-cutting device during normal operation of the device.
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the conveyor belt projects beyond the cabinet-like

frame at the supply end.
