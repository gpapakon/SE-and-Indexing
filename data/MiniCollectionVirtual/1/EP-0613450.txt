<ABSTRACT>
Crystalline microporous solids, such as aluminosilicate zeolites or silica molecular sieves, are grown in a fluoride-containing, substantially non-aqueous medium to form crystals of the order of 0.3-3 mm in size. This growth process involves preparing a mixture containing one or more nutrients capable of forming the crystalline microporous solid; water in a controlled amount; a growth medium comprising hydrogen fluoride and a nitrogen-containing organic base; and optionally an organic solvent and/or a structure-directing agent; and thereafter heating the resulting mixture under conditions which yield the crystalline microporous solid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the synthesis of crystalline microporous solids in a growth 
medium. Crystalline microporous solids include, for example, silica molecular sieves and 
aluminosilicate zeolites. Crystalline microporous solids are well-known for their utility as heterogeneous 
catalysts in industrial organic processes, such as, the alkylation of aromatic compounds with 
olefins; the transalkylation of aromatic compounds; the isomerization of aromatic compounds, 
paraffins, and olefins; the disproportionation of aromatic compounds; the cracking and hydrocracking 
of hydrocarbons; and the oligomerization of olefins. Moreover, zeolites and 
molecular sieves are useful as adsorbents for purifying gases, useful for separating mixtures of 
chemicals and isomers, useful as supports for catalytic metals and metal compounds, and useful 
for ion exchange. Crystalline microporous solids are commonly prepared by hydrothermal methods. 
A typical preparation involves heating one or more nutrients, such as a source of silica and 
optionally a source of alumina, in water in the presence of a mineralizer and a structure 
directing agent until crystallization occurs. The mineralizer, which is usually hydroxide, 
functions as a solubilizer of silica and alumina transporting them through the reactive solution 
or gel to nucleation sites. The structure directing agent includes templates and stabilizers. The 
template, which may be a cation or neutral species, tends to favor the nucleation and growth 
of a particular zeolite. The stabilizer, often referred to as a pore filler, functions in a stabilizing 
role and may be required for a successful synthesis. Water and organic bases, such as primary, 
secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines and tetraalkylammonium halides, are common 
stabilizers. Additionally, the template and stabilizer may assist in controlling pH and/or may 
provide charge balance with a counteranion or anionic framework. Among the known hydrothermal methods are some which employ fluoride as a 
mineralizer Z Daqing et al, for example, disclose in the Journal of the Chemical Society,  
 
Chem. Communications, 1990, 884, the preparation of an aluminosilicate zeolite designated 
"CJS-1" from an aqueous medium containing hydrogen fluoride and piperazine. The molar 
composition of the reaction mixture comprises 0.5 piperazine, 0.04 alumina (Al2O3), 1.0 silica 
(SiO2), 1.0 hydrogen fluoride, and 30 water. Thus, the water to silica molar ratio, H2O/SiO2, is 
30/1 and the water to piperazine molar ratio is
