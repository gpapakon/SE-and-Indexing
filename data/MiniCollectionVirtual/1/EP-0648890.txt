<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition comprising a fluoroaliphatic 
radical-containing agent and a cyclic carboxylic 
anhydride-containing polysiloxane for imparting water and 
oil repellency as well as a soft hand to fibrous substrates 
and other materials treated therewith. 
In another aspect, this invention relates to a method of 
using such composition to treat such substrates and materials, 
and in another aspect it relates to the so-treated 
substrates and materials. The treatment of fibrous substrates with fluorochemical compositions 
to impart water and oil repellency is known; see, 
for example, Banks, Ed., Organofluorine Chemicals and Their 
Industrial Applications, Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, 
England, 1979, pp. 226-234. Such fluorochemical compositions 
include, for example, fluorochemical guanidines (U.S. Patent 
No. 4,540,497), compositions of cationic and non-ionic 
fluorochemicals (U.S. Patent No. 4,566,981), compositions 
containing fluorochemical carboxylic acids and epoxidic cationic 
resins (U.S. Patent No. 4,426,466), and fluoroaliphatic 
alcohols (U.S. Patent No. 4,468,527). Additives have been employed to assist in the oil and water 
repellency of fluorochemical treating agents. U.S. Patent No. 4,215,205 discloses combinations of fluorochemical 
vinyl polymers and carbodiimides in compositions said 
to impart durable water and oil repellency to textiles. Some 
of the carbodiimides disclosed contain fluoroaliphatic 
groups.  
 U.S. Patent No. 5,132,028 discloses compositions for imparting 
water and oil repellency to fabrics such as silk, said 
compositions ccntaining a fluorochemical-type, water and oil 
repellent agent, a carbodiimide, and at least one component 
selected from plasticizers, metal 
alcoholates or esters, zirconium salts, alkylketene dimers, 
aziridines and alkenyl succinic anhydrides. U.S. Patent No. 3,955,027 discloses an improved process and 
composition for water and oil proofing textiles which comprises 
treating a textile with a polymeric fluorocarbon 
finishing agent and at least one reactive polymer extender 
having acid or anhydride functionality and curing the 
treated textile at from 80°C to 170°C for 0.1 to 60 min. Silicones and polymeric siloxanes, such as the industrially 
available polyorganosiloxanes, like polymethylsiloxanes, are 
also known to impart water repellency to leather, textiles, 
and paper; see, for example, Chemistry and Technology of 
Silicones by Walter Noll, Academic Press, New York, pp. 585-603 
(1968). EP-A-299 596 describes
