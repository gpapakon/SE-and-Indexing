<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ignition coils, particularly
modularly constructed, permanent magnet-type ignition coils for
vehicle ignition systems.In use in popular ignition systems for internal combustion
engines is an ignition coil or coils having a C-shaped iron core
within a non-conductive housing, with the primary and secondary
windings wound on individual bobbins inter-nested within one
another and lying within the boundaries of the C-shaped iron core.
The coil is filled with epoxy potting material or other insulating
material as a final step in the process. Despite being filled
with epoxy, the gap between the ends of the legs of the C-shaped
iron core are referred to as an "air gap". It is also known that
the efficiency can be increased and compactness of the overall
coil structure, including the housing, can be reduced by nearly
filling the air gap portion of the aforementioned iron core with a
permanent magnet. Such a coil construction is shown in U.S.
Patent 4,990,881. Part of the success in making such a coil
design commercially practical has been the discovery of a very
strong permanent magnet material containing such elements as
samarium (Sm), neodymium (Nd), and other similar rare earth, high
energy materials. The permanent magnet used is made entirely of
such material and referred to as "fully dense". The air gap of
the iron core of the ignition coil, although reduced by insertion
of the magnet, is still retained in the design of the
aforementioned coil.EP-A-0431322 discloses an ignition coil for an internal
combustion engine as set out in the preamble of the appended
Claim 1. The ignition coil includes a C-shaped core member and a
coil assembly located within the air gap of the C-shaped core
member. The coil assembly includes a primary coil located within
a secondary coil and a T-shaped core member disposed along the
cylindrical axis of the coil assembly. A permanent magnet of full
density is located between one terminal end portion of the C-shaped 
core member and the crossbar end of the T-shaped core
member. The base end of the T-shaped cross member is in
contact with the other terminal end portion of the C-shaped
core member.In contrast, in the subject invention a permanent
magnet-type ignition coil is provided having preferably no
air gap and also assuring that should there be a small air
gap due to component tolerance stack-up it will be in a
predetermined location thereby enhancing considerably the
efficiency and power output of the coil. This allows for a
substantial reduction in the

cylindrical axis of said bobbin and in line contact with a

throughbore of said bobbin, said T-shaped core member (300)
