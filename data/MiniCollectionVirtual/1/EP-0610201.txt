<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention in the field of immunology and medicine relates to antibodies which are specific for human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (hTNFα); fragments, regions and derivatives thereof; and to pharmaceutical and diagnostic compositions and production, diagnostic and therapeutic methods thereof. The invention further relates to nucleotide sequences encoding such antibodies, fragments and regions, as well as vectors and hosts containing such sequences, and methods thereof.The cytokine known as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFα; also termed cachectin) is a protein secreted primarily by monocytes and macrophages in response to endotoxin or other stimuli as a soluble homotrimer of 17 kD protein subunits (Smith, R.A. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262:6951-6954 (1987)). A membrane-bound 26 kD precursor form of TNF has also been described (Kriegler, M. et al., Cell 53:45-53 (1988)). For reviews of TNF, see Beutler, B. et al., Nature 320:584 (1986), Old, L.J., Science 230:630 (1986), and Le, J. et al., Lab. Invest. 56:234 (1987). TNF was originally discovered in the serum of animals injected sequentially with a bacterial vaccine (bacillus Calmette-Guerin, BCG) and endotoxin (Carswell, E.A. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72:3666 (1975)).The expression of the gene encoding TNFα is not limited to cells of the monocyte/macrophage family. Several human non-monocytic tumor cell lines were shown to produce TNF (Rubin, B.Y. et al., J. Exp. Med. 164:1350 (1986); Spriggs, D. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:6563 (1987)). TNF is also produced by CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood T lymphocytes, and by various cultured T and B cell lines (Cuturi, M.C., et al., J. Exp. Med. 165:1581 (1987); Sung, S.-S.J. et al., J. Exp. Med. 168:1539 (1988)).Accumulating evidence indicates that TNF is a regulatory cytokine with pleiotropic biological activities. These activities include: inhibition of lipoprotein lipase synthesis ("cachectin" activity) (Beutler, B. et al., Nature 316:552 (1985)), activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Klebanoff, S.J. et al., J. Immunol. 136:4220 (1986); Perussia, B., et al., J. Immunol. 138:765 (1987)), inhibition of cell growth or stimulation of cell growth (Vilcek, J. et al., J. Exp. Med. 163:632 (1986); Sugarman, B.J. et al., Science 230:943 (1985); Lachman, L.B. et al., J. Immunol. 138:2913 (1987)), cytotoxic action on certain transformed cell types (Lachman, L.B. et al., supra; Darzynkiewicz, Z. et al., Canc. Res. 44:83 (1984)), antiviral activity (Kohase, M. et al., Cell 45:659 (1986); Wong,
