<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fluorine-containing 
curable polymer composition that employs an 
organohydrogenpoly-siloxane crosslinker and that cures 
rapidly to give a low surface-tension release coating. Products capable of releasing tacky 
substances (e.g., pressure-sensitive adhesives) can be 
prepared by forming a cured release coating on the 
surface of many different types of substrates, such as 
paper, plastic films, and synthetic fiber fabrics. 
The curable organopolysiloxane composition disclosed in 
JP-A 63-320 is one example of an agent that will 
produce such a cured release coating. This particular 
composition is composed of a diorganopolysiloxane that 
contains both vinyl and fluoroalkyl groups, an 
organohydrogenpolysiloxane, and a platinum compound. 
Several drawbacks are associated with this curable 
organopolysiloxane composition; it has a slow cure rate 
and its release performance can be poor. Moreover, 
because its silicone component can migrate into tacky 
substances, it can impair the tack of pressure-sensitive 
adhesives. This invention introduces a curable polymer 
composition that solves the problems described above. 
In specific terms, the present invention provides a 
curable polymer composition that cures rapidly into a 
low surface-tension release coating. Our invention is a curable polymer 
composition comprising: 
(A) a fluorine-containing polymer that contains at 
least 2 alkenyl groups in each molecule which is 
obtained by the copolymerization of 
(a) an acrylic monomer with the general formula 
CH2=CX-COOR'  
 
wherein X denotes hydrogen or a methyl radical, and 
R' denotes a C4 to C15 monovalent organic group that 
contains the -CF2- group 
and (b) a silicone macromonomer with the general formula 
CH2=CX-C-O(O)-Q-(RMeSiO)n-Me2SiR'' 
wherein X is defined as above, Q denotes a C1 to C8 
divalent hydrocarbon group, R is methyl or a C3 to 
C8 fluorine-containing monovalent hydrocarbon 
group, Me is methyl, R'' denotes a C2 to C6 alkenyl 
group, and n is an integer with a value of at least 
1; (B) an organohydrogenpolysiloxane that contains at least 3 
silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule; (C) a hydrosilylation catalyst; and (D) a hydrosilylation catalyst inhibitor. The fluorine-containing polymer (A) of the present 
invention is our base component of the composition. It must 
contain at least 2 alkenyl groups in each molecule in order 
to crosslink with the organohydrogenpolysiloxane comprising 
component (B). This fluoropolymer consists of a copolymer of 
(a)
