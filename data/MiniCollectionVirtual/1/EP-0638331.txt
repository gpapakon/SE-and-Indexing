<ABSTRACT>
A time domain reflectometry (TDR) impedance sensor is 
provided for measuring body impedance along a lead or catheter 

implanted in a patient's cardiovascular system. The TDR sensor 
applies an electrical stimulus to the lead and measures 

reflections echoed from impedance variations along and distal 
to the lead, which are superimposed on the applied stimulus. 

The measured signals may be analyzed with respect to time-of-flight 
and distance along the lead to detect a plurality of 

physiologically meaningful signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to body impedance sensors, and more
particularly to body impedance sensors that sense body
impedance using time domain reflectometry analysis.Impedance sensors have been used for various purposes in
implantable medical devices. In United States Patent No.
4,702,253, entitled "Metabolic-Demand Pacemaker and Method of
Using the Same to Determine Minute Volume", issued October 27,
1987, T.A. Nappholz et al. disclose a rate-responsive pacemaker
which measures blood impedance to derive a respiratory minute
volume pacing rate control parameter. This pacemaker (hereinafter
called the " '253 pacemaker") measures impedance by
providing a three-electrode lead using one electrode to sense
heart signals and pace the patient's heart in the conventional
manner and employing the remaining two electrodes to perform
the impedance measurement. A three-electrode lead is not a
standard lead in the art of cardiac pacing. The two electrodes
for measuring impedance are located in a blood vessel in the
vicinity of the patient's pleural cavity. The '253 pacemaker
periodically applies current pulses between one of the
electrodes and the pacemaker case, and measures the voltage
resulting from the applied current between the other electrode
and the pacemaker case. The measured voltage is a function of
the blood impedance in the vessel which, in turn, is dependent
upon the pleural pressure. The '253 pacemaker determines the
minute volume by monitoring the modulation in the impedance
measurement. A problem with the '253 pacemaker is that it
requires a nonstandard lead, a lead having at least three
electrodes. Unipolar (single electrode) and bipolar (dual
electrode) leads are standard in the art of cardiac pacing.
There are many patients with implanted unipolar and bipolar
leads, and if a three-electrode lead is required for a new
pacemaker, then a prior art non-rate-responsive pacemaker 
cannot be replaced by a rate-responsive pacemaker simply by
exchanging pacemakers and using the same lead.United States Patent No. 4,901,725, entitled "Minute
Volume Rate-Responsive Pacemaker, issued February 20, 1990, in
the names of T.A. Nappholz et al., discloses an improved minute
volume-controlled rate-responsive pacemaker (hereinafter called
the " '725 pacemaker") adapted to be used with a conventional
bipolar lead. Such a bipolar lead has two electrodes for
sensing and pacing the heart. In the '725 pacemaker a ring
electrode, in addition to being used for sensing and pacing,
is used to apply a current which flows to the
