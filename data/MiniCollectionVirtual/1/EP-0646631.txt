<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink composition comprising
an infrared ray-emitting fluorescent substance which is
excited by infrared ray and emits light in the infrared region, and a
printed material which is printed using said ink composition. In
particular, the present invention relates to an ink composition in
which an infrared ray-emitting fluorescent substance is well dispersed
and is excellent in light-emitting characteristics, and a printed
material on which an infrared ray-emitting layer with excellent
light-emitting characteristics is printed using said ink composition.To prevent forgery and keep secrecy, an infrared ray-emitting
layer which cannot be visible to naked eyes such as a
stealth bar code is printed on a printed material such as a brochure
or catalogue using an ink composition comprising an infrared ray-emitting
fluorescent substance which emits light in the infrared
region, and the code information is read by an apparatus for optically
reading it to obtain information of goods such as properties and a
price or various personal information (see Japanese Patent Publication
No. 18231/1986 and Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No.
9600/1978). It is tried to print an infrared ray-emitting layer on a
plastic substrate such as a prepaid card, an ID card and a magnetic
card, or a magnetic layer using such ink ribbon.As an infrared ray-emitting fluorescent substance to be
used in the conventional ink composition which is printed to form an 
infrared ray-emitting layer, for example, a phosphoric acid base
infrared ray-emitting fluorescent substance of the formula:
QD1-x-yNdxYbyP4O12
wherein Q is at least one element selected from the group consisting
of Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs; D is at least one element selected from the
group consisting of Sc, Y, La, Ce, Gd, Lu, Ga and In; x is a number of
0.05 to 0.999 and y is a number of 0.001 to 0.95, provided that a sum
of x and y (x + y) is 1.0 or less
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 40594/1978 and
widely used.However, the conventionally used infrared ray-emitting
fluorescent substance has poor dispersibility and may not provide an
ink composition having a sufficient emitted light intensity. In
particular, since the phosphoric acid base infrared ray-emitting fluorescent
substance of the above general formula has a large particle
size of at least 7 µm, it should be ground to a smaller particle size
when a UV curable resin is used as a binder resin, or when the ink
composition comprising the flucrescent substance is printed by offset
pr
