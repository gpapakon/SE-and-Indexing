<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a generic class of ubiquitin-specific proteases which specifically cleave at the C-terminus of the ubiquitin moiety in a ubiquitin fusion protein irrespective of the size of the ubiquitin fusion protein. More specifically, the disclosure relates to ubiquitin-specific proteases of this class which have been isolated from a cell. The disclosure also relates to isolated DNA sequences encoding the proteases of this class.

<DESCRIPTION>
Ubiquitin (Ub), a highly conserved 76-residue
protein, is present in eukaryotic cells either free
or covalently joined to a great variety of proteins.
The posttranslational coupling of ubiquitin to other
proteins is catalyzed by a family of Ub-conjugating
(E2) enzymes and involves formation of an isopeptide
bond between the C-terminal Gly residue of ubiquitin
and the ε-amino group of a Lys residue in an acceptor
protein. One function of ubiquitin is to mark proteins
destined for selective degradation. Ubiquitin
was also shown to have a chaperone function, in that
its transient (cotranslational) covalent association
with specific ribosomal proteins promotes the assembly
of ribosomal subunits.Unlike branched Ub-protein conjugates, which are
formed posttranslationally, linear Ub-protein adducts
are formed as the translational products of natural
or engineered gene fusions. Thus, in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae for example, ubiquitin is
generated exclusively by proteolytic processing of
precursors in which ubiquitin is joined either to
itself, as in the linear polyubiquitin protein Ubi4,
or to unrelated amino acid sequences, as in the
hybrid proteins Ubi1-Ubi3. In growing yeast cells,
ubiquitin is generated largely from the Ubi1-Ubi3
precursors whose "tails" are specific ribosomal
proteins. The polyubiquitin (UBI4) gene is dispensable
in growing cells but becomes essential (as the
main supplier of ubiquitin) during stress. The lack 
of genes encoding mature ubiquitin, and the fusion
structure of ubiquitin precursors in yeast are characteristic
of other eukaryotes as well.Ub-specific, ATP-independent proteases capable
of cleaving ubiquitin from its linear or branched
conjugates have been detected in all eukaryotes
examined but not in bacteria such as Escherichia
coli, which lack ubiquitin and Ub-specific enzymes.
Miller et al. (Biotechnology 1: 698-704 (1989)) have
cloned a S. cerevisiae gene, named YUH1, encoding a
Ub-specific protease that cleaves ubiquitin from its
relatively short C-terminal extensions but is virtually
inactive with larger fusions such as Ub-β-galactosidase
(Ubβgal). Wilkinson et al. (Science 246:
670-673 (1989)) have also cloned a cDNA encoding a
mammalian homolog of the yeast Yuh1 protease. Tobias
and Varshavsky (J. Biol. Chem. 266: 12021-12028
(1991)) reported the cloning and functional analysis
of another yeast gene, named UBP1, which encodes a
Ub-specific processing protease whose amino acid
sequence is dissimilar to those of the Yuh1 protease
and other known proteins. Unlike
