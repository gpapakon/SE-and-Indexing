<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a process for producing the looped form of a pretzel from a straight, stretched rope of dough (1) using a machine so as to lower the production costs in pretzel making. Essentially, the central part (4) of the straight rope of dough (1) is taken up by the receiving part of a mold (3), then the front section of the receiving part of the mold (3) swings upwards and the receiving part of the mold (3) is turned along with the central part (4) of the rope of dough (1) by 360  relative to the ends of the rope of dough (1) so that both sides of the rope are looped together.

Method for shaping a straight strand of dough into a 
pretzel, wherein 


the middle portion (4) of the straight strand of dough 
is picked up 
from a single base surface (30)
 by the 
middle of the strand of dough by means of a pick-up 

former (3), the circumferential surface (8) of which at 
least partially matches that of the pretzel (2), 
as the middle portion (4) of the strand of dough (1) is 
picked up it is laid against the front portion (6) of the 

pick-up former (3), 
the front portion (6) of the pick-up former (3) is then 
pivoted upwards, 
having picked up the strand of dough (1), the front 
portion (6) of the pick-up former (3) is pivoted upwards 

until the pick-up former (3) has reached a vertical 
position such that the middle portion (4) of the strand 

of dough (1) is at the highest point of the pick-up 
former (3), 
the pick-up former (3) with the middle portion (4) of 
the strand of dough (1) is then rotated by 360° relative 

to the ends (5) of the strand of dough (1) so that the 
two sides of the strand become intertwined, 
the strand of dough (1) is then pivoted off the pick-up 
former (3) such that before it is tipped off the pick-up 

former (3) into the horizontal so that the middle portion 
(4) of the intertwined strand of dough (1) is set down 
on 
the base surface (30)
,
 the pick-up former (3) travels 
(arrow 9) transversely to the original direction of the 

strand of dough (1), and 
in order to press on the ends (5) of the strand of 
dough, as it moves downwards, the pick-up former (3) 

presses with its side portions (10) against the outer  
 

edges (11) of the pretzel onto the ends (25) of the 
strand of dough (1) lying thereunder. 
Method as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
as it picks up the middle portion (4) of the strand of 

dough (1), the pick-up former (3) moves substantially 
vertically towards the strand of dough (1) with its front 

portion (6) pointing downwards and the strand of dough 
(1) is held against the circumferential surface (8) of 

the pick-up former (3) by means of gripping members (12) 
arranged on one or both sides of the front portion (6) 

thereof. 
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 
the pick-up former (3) has a support edge (13) extending 

around one of its sides (13) and protruding above the 
circumferential surface (8). 
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 3,
characterised in that
 
as it picks up the middle portion (4) of the strand of 

dough (1), the pick-up former (3) is moved substantially 
horizontally from the front towards the strand of dough 

(1) and the strand of dough (1) is held against the 
circumferential surface (8) of the pick-up former (3) by 

means of gripping members (12) arranged on one side or on 
both sides of the front edge (6) thereof. 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 
as it picks up the middle portion (4) of the strand of 

dough (1), the circumferential surface (8) of the pick-up 
former (3) is stretched and deformed to provide a curved  

 
outer contour before the intertwining movement about the 

vertical axis. 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 
as the middle portion (4) of the stand of dough (1) is 

picked up by the pick-up former (3), the pick-up former 
(3) is moved in a transverse movement in addition to the 

pivoting movement about the horizontal axis (15) so that 
the middle portion (4) of the strand of dough (1) always 

remains in essentially the same vertical plane. 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 
the pick-up former (3) has, protruding out from its side 

areas (10), extendable lateral pressing plates (26) for 
pressing the ends underneath the intertwined pretzel. 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 
a central pressing surface (27) is arranged approximately 

in the centre of the pick-up former (3) to close the 
pretzel (2) by pressing on the central knot thereof. 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 
the strands of dough (1) are timed so that they move 

lengthwise along the working area of the intertwining 
machine and are intertwined to form a pretzel (2) during 

stoppage so that they can continue to be conveyed on the 
same conveyor belt (28). 
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
