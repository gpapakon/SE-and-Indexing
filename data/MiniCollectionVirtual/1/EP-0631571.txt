<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides a process for the 
asymmetric hydrogenation of N-acylhydrazones to 
optically active N-acylhydrazines. This invention also 
provides a process for the reductive N-N bond cleavage 
of N-acylhydrazines to amines. This invention also 
provides a multistep reductive amination process for the 
conversion of keto group-bearing compounds to 
corresponding chiral amino group-bearing compounds. In contrast to the high enantioselectivities 
observed in certain catalytic olefin (C=C bond) and 
ketone (C=O bond) hydrogenations, little success has 
been achieved in the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation 
of the C=N bond. The limited success that has been 
reported is mostly involved with the reduction of 
imines. H. E. Baumgarten et al., J. Org. Chem., 41(24), 
3806 (1976), disclose the catalytic hydrogenation of N-1-phenylethyl-N'-carbo-tert-butoxyhydrazone 
to N-1-phenylethyl-N'-carbo-tert-butoxyhydrazine. 
It is stated 
that this is a general procedure but that it cannot be 
used for optically active hydrazines because the 
reductions are not stereoselective. K. Harada Asymmetric Synthesis, Volume 5, Academic 
Press, 1985, p. 360 describes the hydrogenation of 
optically active hydrazones to optically active amines. 
There is no disclosure nor suggestion of a method to 
generate optically active products from non-optically 
active starting materials. J. of Chem. Soc., Chemical Communications N°22, 15th Nov 1988 pp 1466-1467 discloses the hydrogenation of imines ArC(Me)=NCH2Ph (Ar=Ph, 2-MeO-C6H4, 4 MeO-C6H4) to the corresponding secondary amines at 1000 psig H2 in a 1:1 ratio C6H6/MeOH using an insitu Rh' (R)-cycphos system (cycphos = Ph2P CH(C6H11) CH2PPh2). A maximum of 91% enantiomeric excess is achieved at lower temperatures in the presence of iodide catalyst.  J. Souppe et al., J. Organometallic Chemistry, 250, 
227-236 (1983) report the reductive cleavage of the N-N 
bond in 1,2-diphenyl hydrazine by samarium diiodide to 
yield aniline in 55% yield after a 4 day reaction 
period. There is no disclosure concerning the 
reactivity of samarium diiodide with N-acylhydrazines. The present invention provides processes for the 
asymmetric hydrogenation of N-acylhydrazones to 
optically active N-acylhydrazines, and the reductive 
amination of keto group-bearing compounds to 
corresponding chiral amino group-bearing compounds. The 
use of transition metal catalysts bearing chiral ligands 
in these processes provides products in optically active 
form. The present invention also provides a
