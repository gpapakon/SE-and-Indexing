 OUANTUM-WELL DIODE LASER DescriptionBackground of the InventionIn recent years, improvements in laser performance have resulted from the fabrication of so-called"superlattice" and quantum-well structures. A lattice is formed of alternate layers of thin (5-40 nm) epitaxial films of semiconductor material of different band gap to form a plurality of heterojunction interfaces. A thin film of narrow band gap material, e.g., GaAs, is sandwiched between thin films of wider band gap material, e.g., AlxGaα.x)As to form potential wells in the conduction and valence bands. Such wells restrict or limit carrier/electron movement to two dimensions. Such a multilayer is referred to as a two-dimensional quantum- well, or simply a quantum-well. In the example given, the electron motion is restricted in the direction perpendicular to the heterojunction interfaces, while the electrons are free to move in the other two directions. Quantum-well heterostructures generally exhibit more efficient luminescence intensities than bulk crystal heterostructures and have, therefore, been incorporated into the active region of laser devices.Devices are usually formed of multiple layers of quantum-wells and when the barrier thickness between quantum-wells is reduced, so that well wave functions couple, a "superlattice" is formed.Generally, the materials of choice for superlattice and/or quantum-well structures are the Group III and V elements and, in particular, GaAs and Al alloys thereof. These materials are closely lattice matched, yet the difference in the band gaps of the GaAs versus the alloy 

AlxGaα.x)As can vary at room temperature from O eV to as much as 0.75 eV (as x increases from 0 to 1) . The first property simplifies heterostructure fabrication, while the second property makes fabrication of quantum-wells possible.GaAs based quantum-well devices are limited in wavelength range from 0.7 to 0.9 microns. Thus, for certain applications, researchers have turned their attention to other materials. In particular, since 1984, lasers operating at the wavelength of 2-4 microns have been sought for use in long haul communication over fluoride glass fibers. The then current silica fibers utilized a wavelength of 1.55 microns, but were much more lossy than the fluoride glass fibers were predicted to be at a wavelength of 2-4 microns.Based upon this need, research was directed toward development of GalnAsSb compound structures, since this alloy has a room temperature direct band gap which is continuously adjustable between 0.29 and
