<ABSTRACT>
Means for transmitting force from a control rod (8) to a hydraulic piston (14) via a reaction disk (11) and a pushrod (13) in a pneumatically assisted braking system. The pushrod engages a cup (12) through a thrust washer (15) said cup housing the reaction disk (11), and is guided by a sleeve (16) fitted in the hydraulic piston (14).

Force transmission device for an assembly 
consisting of a pneumatic brake-booster (1) and of a 

master cylinder (2), comprising: 

a control rod (8) capable, starting from a resting 
position, of undergoing a movement in an axial direction 

under the effect of an input force, this rod being 
terminated by a probe (10); 
a pneumatic piston (5) movable in this axial 
direction, from a resting position, under the effect of 

a pressure differential controlled by the axial movement 
of the control rod, this pneumatic piston having an axial 

annular surface (5a) which surrounds the probe; 
a reaction disk (11) housed in a cup (12) with flat 
bottom (12a) and having a free face (11a) onto which the 

axial annular surface of said pneumatic piston and the 
plunger are capable of applying output forces; 
a substantially axial thrust rod (13) a first end 
(13a) of which receives these output forces and another 

end (13b) of which retransmits them to a hydraulic piston 
(14) of the master cylinder; and 
retaining means (14a, 16) for ensuring that the 
thrust rod maintains a substantially axial direction, 
 
characterized in that the thrust rod (13) is securely 

attached, at its first end (13a), to a flat thrust washer 
(15) coming to bear, with the possibility of a relative 

sliding, against the flat bottom (12a) of said cup, and 
in that said retaining means are borne by the master 

cylinder (2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, the hydraulic piston of the master cylinder having 

an axial cylindrical bore (14a) into which the second end 
of the thrust rod enters, said retaining means comprise 

a restriction (16) of the internal diameter of this bore, 
adapted to limit the possibility of the thrust rod 

deviating from said axial direction.
