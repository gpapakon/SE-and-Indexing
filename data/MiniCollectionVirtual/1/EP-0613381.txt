<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a composite material, especially a biomedical device, e.g. an ophthalmic device, preferably a contact lens, with one or more wettable surfaces capable of holding a continous layer of aqueous fluid thereon which composite material comprises a bulk material and a hydrophilic coating characterized in that the hydrophilic coating consists of a carbohydrate attached covalently to reactive groups at the surface of the bulk material, either directly or via functional groups of an oligofunctional compound, said oligofunctional compound in turn having functional groups being capable of reacting with said reactive groups at the surface of the bulk material and with the carbohydrate, wherein said reactive groups are either inherently (a priori) present in the bulk material or wherein said reactive groups have been attached to the surface of the bulk material by a plasma surface preparation, as well as to a process of manufacture of such a composite material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to composite materials for biomedical use that possess considerably
improved retention of an aqueous layer on the surfaces. The invention also relates to the
production of such materials from materials that possess suitable bulk properties, but
inadequate retention of an aqueous layer. In a particular aspect, the materials and method
of this invention are useful for the fabrication of ophthalmic devices, e.g. contact lenses.There are many applications of materials where retention of a thin film of aqueous fluid is
desirable. For example, the retention of an aqueous fluid layer is beneficial for lubrication of
catheters, the retention of an aqueous fluid layer can reduce protein fouling on the surface
of pacemakers and artificial vascular grafts, or the retention of an aqueous fluid layer can
prevent the colonization of a surface by bacteria as they are unable to attach properly. In
another aspect, the facile movement of an eyelid over a contact lens is important for the
comfort of the wearer; this sliding motion is facilitated by the presence of a continuous layer
of tear fluid on the contact lens, a layer which lubricates the tissue/lens interface. However,
clinical tests have shown that currently available contact lenses partially dry out between
blinks, thus increasing friction between the eyelid and the lens. The increased friction
results in soreness of the eyes and movement of the contact lens. Since the average period
between blinks is ca. 12 seconds, it would be advantageous to fabricate a wettable and
biocompatible contact lens that can hold a continuous layer of tear fluid for more than 12
seconds. Current biomedical materials do not reach this target; for instance, contact lenses
fabricated from highly water swellable polymer pHEMA retain such a tear layer for
approximately 5 seconds only.Thus materials with wettable and biocompatible surfaces are highly desirable for many
applications. The wettability of materials is strongly dependent on the chemical composition
of the material surface. In particular, the ability of the surface to hold a continuous layer of
an aqueous solution, such as tear fluid, is affected by the composition of the material
surface. Early attempts to solve the wettability problem in the ophthalmic field were based
on producing hydrophilic materials. For example, in an attempt to make wettable soft 
contact lenses, silicone elastomers with pendant epoxy groups were prepared by
crosslinking epoxidized silicone compounds (French patent FR 2,622,201,
