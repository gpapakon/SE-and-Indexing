<ABSTRACT>
A probe for testing semi-conductor chips comprising a silicon 
substrate 120 with a plurality of recesses 140. A film 130 

on the surface of the substrate extends over each recess. 
Contacts 101 are formed on the film 130 over the recesses 

140, and conductive leads 110 are connected to the contacts. 
The film 130 permits a degree of resilient differential 

vertical movement of the contacts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a probe for testing semiconductor 
chips. In LSI manufacturing, after a plurality of chips are formed 
on a wafer it is necessary to test their electrical 
operation. This is performed typically as follows:
 
Chip manufacturing process => continuity test => dicing => 
packaging => acceleration test => shipping Here, the test process consists of a continuity test and an 
acceleration test, and the dicing and packaging processes are 
placed between them. The continuity test determines whether 
or not the electrical operation of each individual chip is 
normal. The chips in which normal operation is confirmed 
will be cut chip by chip in the dicing process thereafter. 
This is called the die state. Next, these individual chips 
are packaged and an acceleration test (a test to simulate 
long-time operation by operating a circuit at a high 
temperature of about 150 Î¦C) is carried out. The acceleration test was performed in the past after 
completion of packaging. However, in the recent multi-chip 
module technology (MCM) the desirability of guaranteeing 
chips at a stage before being connected with external 
equipment has arisen. The chips in this stage are called 
bare chips. Moreover, if chips can be tested in batch at a 
stage before dicing, a cost advantage will accrue. Thus it would be desirable to carry out an acceleration test 
at the wafer level as follows:
 
Chip manufacturing process => continuity test at wafer 
level => acceleration test at wafer level => dicing ...  However, it is difficult to electrically connect wafers to be 
tested with a probe card, which is a conventional connection 
tool, in cases where an acceleration test is carried out at 
the wafer level at high temperatures. Probe cards are not 
suitable for high density products or, due to differential 
expansion between the card and the wafer, use at high 
temperatures. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved 
probe for testing semi-conductor chips. The invention is defined in the attached claims. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which:

embodiment of the invention; Figure 2 is a sectional side view of the microprobe of Figure 
1 in contact with an LSI chip to be tested; Figures 3 to 8 illustrate steps in the manufacture of the
