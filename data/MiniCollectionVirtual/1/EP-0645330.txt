<ABSTRACT>
Gripping device (20) for flat objects, comprising a perforated belt (15) entrained by drive means, and means for seizing by means of reduced pressure arranged inside the said belt (15), this gripping device (20) having a gripping face consisting of the said belt (15) moving in a predetermined transfer direction (D) and in front of which a stack of flat objects is presented, and means for preventing double feed (24) being arranged substantially opposite an exit edge of the said gripping face (2). The means for seizing by means of reduced pressure comprise at least two heads at reduced pressure (21, 22) which are substantially adjacent and aligned in the transfer direction (D), one (22) of which is at least partially opposite the means for preventing double feed (24). Use for automatic sorting of mail.

<CLAIMS>
Flat object holding device comprising a perforated belt (15)
driven by drive means, suction grasping means inside said belt (15),

a holding side (2) across which said belt moves in a predetermined
transfer direction (D) and adapted to receive the first object from a

stack of flat objects, double pick separator means (24) being
disposed substantially facing an exit edge of said holding side (2),

characterized in that the suction holding means comprise at least two
substantially adjacent suction heads (21, 22) aligned in the transfer

direction (D), one (22) of said suction heads at least partly facing
the double pick separator means (24).
Holding device (20) according to claim 1 further comprising
means (40) for generating on its holding side (2) a low suction high

flowrate area (Z
0
) and characterized in that the adjacent suction
heads (21, 22) are disposed between said low suction high flowrate

generator means (40) and the end of said holding side (2) adjacent
the double pick separator means (24).
Flat object unstacking device (10) comprising feed means (14,
13), a flat object holding device (20) according to claim 1 or claim

2, double pick separator means (24) and transfer means, characterized
in that the holding device (20) comprises at least two adjacent

suction heads (22, 21) aligned in the transfer direction (D).
