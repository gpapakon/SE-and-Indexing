<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the problem of recycling of products of complicated 
structure and is based on the idea to provide each component (2 to 6) of the product 

with a memory (2a, 2b ... 6b) in which not only at the timing of production information 
such as location of material to be recycled is stored but also additional 

data, e.g., about repair and/or specific stress to which the component has been exposed 
during its use. Such additional data may be collected via specific sensors (7, 8) 

provided either on each component or in or on the body of the product to be 
memorized in the memory of each component. Based on the idea of the invention, 

the life history of each component of the discarded product can be checked 
individually for determining whether such component may be reused or disposed 

for disassembling and recycling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of recycling several components being
included in a product.There are many different kinds of products made by different manufacturers
coming into the market and each such product also contains many different kinds
of components. If a product becomes obsolete or is taken out of service, the
user wants to abandon the product and usually disposes it in one or another
undesirable way. Even if the product itself becomes old or invalid, components
contained in the product or a part of each component, however may be reused in
another product. Therefore, recently recycling of those components is eagerly
discussed under an environmental point of view.One way to enable recycling of a component easier is to indicate on the surface
thereof the kind of material which constitutes the component. For example, if a
component such as a housing of a television receiver or a chassis of automobile
is formed of a single plastic or metal material, the component can bear the name
of the material or a symbol representing the same. It is, however, very
difficult to indicate enough information to reliably recycle the component, if
the latter is comprised of many kinds of materials or has a complicated
constructional composition.As a type of recycling of a component, it has also been considered to reuse the
component as it is, without breaking it up, i.e., in an appliance of same type
or in a similar type of the product in which the component was used before, or
as a service spare part. In that case, the indication of the kind of material is
insufficient and it is more important to know how long the component has 
already been used or whether the component can still be reused for long enough a
period in the future. Such information is very important, especially for
electrical components or mechanical components having a movable part. Such
transitional information can not be indicated properly on the surface of a
component.Meanwhile, it is known, for example by Canadian Patent 1,272,808, to include a
memory in the product for storing information data as to production and repair
or maintenance service of the product. Such information, however, is useless for
recycling, because some components taken from the product are transferred to a
recycling process instead of the product itself. Furthermore, if the product has
not been repaired in spite of that the component has been impaired or damaged,
such information is incomplete and not reliable.According to US-Patent 4,586,147, a product may be further

<CLAIMS>
Method of recycling several components of a product comprising
steps of:


a) reading out from memory means (2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 6; 12) provided within the
product information data commonly related to said several components Or to said

product as a whole, said information data being related to bibliographic data of said
several components (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11), to stress to which said several components

have been exposed and to at least one of location data of said several components
and instruction data of disassembly of said product;
b) checking the quality of said several components according to the information
data related to the stress;
c) disassembling the product to separate said several components according to
the location data and/or the instruction data;
d) sorting said several components according to the bibliographic data; and
e) forwarding said several components to subsequent use thereof.
Method according to claim 1, further comprising step of:

f) Oproducing quality data representing the quality of said several components,
wherein said step of sorting includes sorting said several components according to

the quality data.
