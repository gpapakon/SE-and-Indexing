<ABSTRACT>
A machine-tool has a spindle carrier (111) and at least one tool exchanger (120). The tool changer (120) conveys machining tools (116) between a storage position and a working position. At least one hydraulically controllable working cylinder (1) is associated thereto as a driving unit (123). A locking device (52) monted on the working cylinder (1) mechanically locks it in the housing when the release pressure of the working piston (6) falls off.

<CLAIMS>
Machine tool with a headstock (111) and one or more tool 
changers (120) for transferring machining tools between a 

magazine position and a working position, wherein the tool 
changer (120) is assigned as drive unit (123) one or more fluid-actuable 

operating cylinders (1) with a cylinder housing (2) in 
which an operating piston (6) is mounted with axial movement 

facility, characterized in that there is provided on the 
operating cylinder (1) a locking device (52) which, in the event 

of a decrease on release pressure, locks the operating piston (6) 
in a safe position mechanically fixed to the casing, and which 

is so designed that it subsequently releases the operating piston 
(6) for movement only when it is no longer subject to any 

actuating force acting such as to move it from its safe position. 
Machine tool according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
release pressure is an operating pressure of the operating 

cylinder (1). 
Machine tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the locking device (52) is integrated in the operating cylinder 

(1). 
Machine tool according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the locking device (52) is assigned to an end sealing 

wall (4) of the cylinder casing (2) and serves to lock the 
operating piston (6) securely to the casing, mechanically 

releasable, in an end-of-stroke position close to the sealing 
wall (4).  

 
Machine tool according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the locking device (52) has a first locking section (53) 

located on the side of the operating piston (6) facing the 
sealing wall (4) and connected to the operating piston so as to 

be capable of moving along with it, that the locking device (52) 
has a second locking section (58) located in or on the sealing 

wall (4) and moveable at right-angles to the direction of stroke 
(28, 29) of the operating piston (6) between a locked position 

and a release position wherein, in the locked position when the 
operating piston (6) assumes the end-of-stroke position, it 

engages with the first locking section (53) which is at the same 
time in a locking position, and wherein - in the release position 

- it is disengaged from the first locking section (53) so as to 
permit the axial stroke of the operating piston (6), that the 

second locking section (58), when the operating cylinder (1) is 
in a state of operational readiness, is under a fluid pressure 

(release pressure) pushing it in the direction of the release 
position, which is capable of holding the second locking section 

(58) during operational readiness constantly in the release 
position against a locking force prestressing it in the direction 

of the locked position, and that it is impossible for the release 
pressure to shift the second locking section (58) from the locked 

position into the release position, so long as the first locking 
section (53) assuming the locking position is subject to a 

certain actuating force, is acting towards axial removal of the 
operating piston (6) from the end-of-stroke position. 
Machine tool according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
operating pressure of the operating cylinder (1) is provided as 

the release pressure acting on the second locking section (58).  
 
Machine tool according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in 
that, provided on the cylinder casing (2) and in particular on 

the sealing wall (4), is a connection device (14) for a pressure 
medium line supplying the operating pressure, which communicates 

with a pressure medium duct inside the cylinder casing (2) which 
leads to the second locking section (58). 
Machine tool according to any of claims 5 to 7, characterized 
in that the second locking section (58) is prestressed in the 

direction of the locked position by means of a spring force, 
expediently provided by a mechanical compression spring assembly. 
Machine tool according to any of claims 5 to 8, characterized 
in that the second locking section (58) is in driving connection 

with a locking piston (63), which can be acted upon at one end 
by the release pressure acting in the direction of the release 

position. 
Machine tool according to any of claims 4 to 9, characterized 
in that the release pressure is independent of the operating 

pressure which prevails in the working space (7) of the operating 
cylinder (1) adjacent to the sealing wall (4). 
Machine tool according to any of claims 5 to 10, 
characterized in that the locking elements (74, 75) of the two 

locking sections (53, 58) are so designed as to be capable of 
engaging positively from behind in the direction of adjustment 

(60) of the second locking section (58). 
Machine tool according to any of claims 5 to 11, 
characterized in that the locking element (74) of the first

right-angles to the direction of stroke of the operating piston 

(6), and that the projection (77) has an assigned and expediently 
essentially complementary second locking face (80), which comes 

to lie in the locked position next to the first locking face 
(79), wherein the first locking section (53) in the locking 

position is provided with movement play, in the direction of 
stroke (28, 29) of the operating piston (6), relative to the 

second locking section (58) in the locked position. 
Machine tool according to claim 12 or 13, characterized in 
that the recess (76) is in the form of an annular groove. 
Machine tool according to any of claims 5 to 14,
