<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an efficient method for refolding insulin-like growth factor-I
(IGF-I) that has been produced in heterologous host cells and is present in these cells as
clumps of insoluble protein.The production of large quantities of relatively pure, biologically active polypeptides and
proteins is important economically for the manufacture of human and animal pharmaceutical
formulations, enzymes, and other specialty chemicals. For production of many proteins,
recombinant DNA techniques have become the method of choice because large quantities of
exogenous proteins can be expressed in bacteria and other host cells free of other
contaminating proteins.Producing recombinant protein involves transfecting host cells with DNA encoding the
protein and growing the cells under conditions favoring expression of the recombinant protein.
The prokaryote E. coli is favored as host because it can be made to produce recombinant
proteins in high yields. Numerous U.S. patents on general bacterial expression of
recombinant-DNA-encoded proteins exist, including U.S. Pat. No. 4,565,785 on a
recombinant DNA molecule comprising a bacterial gene for an extracellular or periplasmic
carrier protein and non-bacterial gene; 4,673,641 on coproduction of a foreign polypeptide
with an aggregate-forming polypeptide; 4,738,921 on an expression vector with a trp
promoter/operator and trp LE fusion with a polypeptide such as IGF-I; 4,795,706 on
expression control sequences to include with a foreign protein; and 4,710,473 on specific
circular DNA plasmids such as those encoding IGF-I.Under some conditions, certain heterologous proteins expressed in large quantities from
bacterial hosts are precipitated within the cells in dense masses, recognized as bright spots
visible within the enclosure of the cells under a phase contrast microscope at magnifications
down to 1000 fold. These clumps of precipitated proteins are referred to as "refractile
bodies," and constitute a significant portion of the total cell protein. Brems et al.,Biochemistry,24: 7662 (1985). On the other hand, the clumps of protein may not be visible
under the phase contrast microscope, and the expression "inclusion body" is often used to
refer to the aggregates of protein whether visible or not under the phase contrast microscope.Recovery of the protein from these bodies has presented numerous problems, such as
how to separate the protein encased within the cell from the cellular material and proteins
harboring it, and how to recover the inclusion body protein

<CLAIMS>
A process for reactivating insoluble, misfolded IGF-I contained in prokaryotic host cells,
which process comprises:


(a) isolating said IGF-I; and
(b) incubating said isolated IGF-I in an alkaline buffered solution comprising no more
than 3 M chaotropic agent and the minimal concentration of reducing agent sufficient

for solubilization, under conditions of IGF-I concentration and incubation temperature
and time whereby solubilization, unfolding, and refolding of the IGF-I all occur during

the incubation.
The process of claim 1 wherein the IGF-I is isolated from the periplasm of the host
cells.
The process of claim 1 wherein the concentration of IGF-I is about 0.5-5.5 mg IGF-I
per ml.
The process of claim 1 wherein said buffered solution has a pH of at least about 7.5.
The process of claim 1 wherein said buffered solution has a pH of about 7.5-10.5.
The process of claim 5 wherein said buffered solution comprises Capso (3-[Cyclohexylamino]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid) buffer at about

pH 8.5-10.5.
The process of claim 1 wherein the incubation step is carried out at about 10-40°C
for at least about 1 hour.
The process of claim 1 wherein the incubation step is carried out at about 15-37°C
for at least about 1 hour.
The process of claim 1 wherein said chaotropic agent is urea at 1-3 M or guanidine
hydrochloride at about 1 M.
The process of claim 1 wherein said reducing agent is dithiothreitol at about 1-8 mM,
β-mercaptoethanol at about 0.2-2 mM, or cysteine.
The process of claim 1 wherein said chaotropic agent is urea at about 1.5-2.5 M and
said reducing agent is dithiothreitol at about 2-4 mM or β-mercaptoethanol at about 1-2

mM.
The process of claim 1 wherein said buffered solution additionally comprises a
hydrophobic agent.
The process of claim 12 wherein said hydrophobic agent is methanol or ethanol.
The process of claim 1 wherein step (a) is carried out by treating the host cell culture
with a buffered solution of ionic strength sufficient to substantially solubilize the host

polypeptides, but not the insoluble, misfolded IGF-I, disrupting the cells to form a
soluble fraction and a fraction containing the insoluble, misfolded IGF-I, centrifuging

the disrupted cells, and collecting the pellet containing the insoluble, misfolded IGF-I
fraction. 
The process of claim 14 wherein the cells are treated by suspension in the buffered
solution at about pH 5 to 9 and at an ionic strength of about 0.01 to 2 M.
The process of claim 15 wherein the buffered solution in which the cells are suspended
is at about pH 6 to 8 and has an ionic strength of 0.1 to 0.2 M.
The process of claim 1 wherein said host cells are bacterial cells.
The process of claim 17 wherein said bacterial cells are 
E. coli.
The process of claim 18 wherein the 
E. coli
 cells are deficient in an endogenous
protease.
The process of claim 19 wherein the 
E. coli
 cells have the complete genotype of 
E. coli
