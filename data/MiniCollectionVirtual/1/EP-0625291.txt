<ABSTRACT>
A boost-converter with low losses comprising a series connection of an energy storing main inductor (L1) and a main diode (D1) connected between a first input terminal (P) for a first voltage and a first output terminal (Q) for a second, higher dc-voltage. The centre point (R) between the components connected in series is, via a controllable switching element (M1), connected to a common second input and output terminal (S). A control circuit (10) for the switching element is provided to monitor the voltage of said first output terminal (Q) of the converter and to control the on and off operation of the switching element (M1). The convertor further comprises an auxiliary inductor (L3), connected between said centre point (R) and a terminal (T) on the switching element (M1), in order to limit the reverse current in the main diode when the switching element (M1) changes to conducting condition, and a series connection of a zener diode (D19) and two diodes (D2 and D3) between said terminal (T) and the output terminal (Q) to transfer energy stored in the auxiliary inductor (L3) towards the output terminal (Q). Furthermore a capacitor (C18) for temporary storage of energy from the inductor (L3) is connected between said centre point (R) and the connecting point (N) between said two diodes (D2 and D3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a boost-converter with low 
losses. So called boost-converters are normally used in order to 
create a higher second dc-voltage from a generated first 
voltage, which second voltage is fed to some kind of load. 
Such a converter normally makes use of a series connection 
of an energy storing inductor and a diode connected between 
an input-terminal from the first voltage source and an 
output-terminal for the second voltage. The centre-point 
between the series connected components is connected to 
earth via a switching device such a transistor. A capacitor 
can be connected between the input-terminal and earth in 
order to decouple current ripples on the input and to damp 
radio interference to the fed power supply system. In 
addition, an energy storing (filtering) capacitor is 
connected between the output-terminal and earth. Finally, 
a control circuit for the switching element is arranged to 
monitor the output voltage from the converter and to 
control the switching element so that, for example, the 
output voltage is kept constant independent of the load and 
the input voltage for a given period. A simple boost-converter thus functions in the following 
manner. When the switching element switches to non-conducting 
condition, the voltage at said centre point increases 
to a value which exceeds the input voltage. The diode 
conducts in the forward direction and current is fed to the  
 
load including the capacitor at the output. When the 
switching element thereafter switches to conducting 
condition due to a signal from the control circuit, current 
from said centre point will be conducted to earth via the 
switching element, whereby the voltage at the centre point 
falls. The current through the switching element is, in the 
first instance, composed of a contribution from the input, 
via the inductance, and a contribution which is in the form 
of a reverse current through the diode which has not yet 
been blocked. After a certain delay, the recovery time of 
the diode, the diode is blocked and the current through, 
just as with the voltage across, the switching element 
rapidly decreases. The reverse current phenomena through the diode is a 
problem with this type of circuit and creates power losses 
in both the diode itself and the switching element. Because 
of strong current spikes, radio interference can also 
arise. It is generally desirable to operate the device with a high 
switch frequency in order to limit the inductance value and 
the physical size of
