<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a variable-transmission visor for headgear.   The visor (3) comprises at least two zones (31, 32,  alpha 1,  alpha 2) with different light-absorption capacities. In cases in which the visor is fixed to the helmet (2) of an aircraft pilot (1), a top zone (31,  alpha 1), through which the pilot looks outside the aircraft (5), absorbs more light than a bottom zone (32,  alpha 2), through which the pilot views the instrument panel (controls) (6). Application: helmet equipment for missions involving rapid passage from a brightly lit environment to a darkened one.

<CLAIMS>
Visor for headgear with variable transmission
of light, the visor comprising at least two differently

light-absorbing zones (31, 32), each zone being dedicated
to a zone of the exterior space (α
1
, α
2
) scanned
by the gaze, characterized in that the transmissions

vary from one zone to another with different rates of
transition.
Visor according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises an upper zone (31) and a lower zone

(32), the upper zone absorbing more light than the
lower zone (32).
Visor according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the transition rate of the lower zone (32) is

greater than the transition rate of the upper zone
(31).
Visor according to either one of Claims 2 or 3,
characterized in that the lower zone (32) has a range

of transmission making it possible to obtain higher
transmissions than in the upper part.
Visor according to any one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that the visor (3) forming part of the

gear of a pilot (1) of an aircraft (5), the upper zone
serves for looking at the exterior (α
1
) of the aircraft
(5).
Visor according to any one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterized in that the visor (3) forming part of the

gear of a pilot (1) of an aircraft, the lower zone (32) 
serves for looking at the instrument panel (6) of the

aircraft.
Visor according to any one of the preceding

claims, characterized in that the zone (31) of highest
absorption has a range of transmission of between 75%

and 20%.
Visor according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the zone (32) of lowest

absorption has a range of transmission of between 85%
and 40%.
Visor according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the visor (3) comprising

photochromic substances, the zones (31, 32) of the
visor comprise different concentrations of photochromic

substances.
Visor according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the visor (3) comprising

photochromic substances, the zones (31, 32) of the
visor comprise different photochromic substances.
Visor according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the variable transmission function

is afforded by an LCD material.
Visor according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the variable transmission is

afforded by an association of the photochrome and LCD
technologies making it possible to obtain different

rates of transition from one zone to another.
