Title: DIAGNOSTIC METHOD FOR DETECTION OFACTIVE ATHEROGENESISBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to a method of detecting active atherogenesis. More particularly, this invention relates to a diagnostic method for the reliable detection of active atherogenesis involving the separation and quantification of atherogenic and other lipoproteins.2. Description of Related ArtAtherosclerosis is a degenerative disease of the arteries characterized by thickening and hardening of their walls. Since atherosclerosis occurs in virtually epidemic proportions, the need for a diagnostically accurate screening method cannot be overstated.It is important to the prevention of atherosclerosis to develop a practical and accurate screening test for significant changes in atherogenic lipoproteins. This goal has not been achieved because of the cumbersome and expensive methodology reeded for isolation and quantification of serum lipoproteins, and therefore the i.-edical community's focus on the study of much simpler lipoprotein components, such as: total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoproteins A and B.These approaches were not surprising in view of the known practical limitation of the two basic methods for lipoprotein separation: lipoprotein agarose gel or cellulose acetate electrophoresis and analytical ultracentrifugation using Philpott-Svenson's optical system. Both methods are extremely time consuming and, although they can be relatively well standardized, their resolution of the main lipoprotein 

classes is suboptimal. Thus, it is understandable why quantification of the simple components of lipoproteins insufficiently replaced the measurement of the concentration of actual lipoprotein moieties separated into their classes.The history of lipoprotein electrophoresis illustrates these problems. Analytical filtration paper was introduced in 1949 as the first oldest supporting medium for the separation of serum lipoproteins. Unfortunately it only resulted in two distinct fractions, α and β. (Table I, pattern 0). The introduction of 1 % agarose gel allowed separation of a pre-/? complex composed of lipoproteins of higher molecular weight of approximately 4,500,000 to 15,000,000 daltons (Table I, pattern 1 ,2). Further refinements of the agarose gel (1.2% gel in 0.035 % EDTA buffer, 1 % sucrose) allowed a partial separation of pre-β subfractions. (Table I, pattern 3,4). According to combined ultracentrifugal and electrophoretic studies, the α2 -fraction
