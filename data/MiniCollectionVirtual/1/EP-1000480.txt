The transmitter (4) comprises a channel encoder (14) for deriving encoded symbols from source symbols. The receiver (6) comprises a channel decoder (28) for reconstructing the source symbols from the signal received from the transmission channel (10). According to the present invention, the transmitter (4) comprises a separate encoder for coding and transmitting a coding property used in the channel encoder (14) to the receiver (6). The receiver (6) is arranged for receiving the encoded coding property from the transmission medium, and the separate channel decoder (26) is arranged for decoding the encoded coding property. The coding property provided by the separate channel decoder (26) is passed to setting means (27) in the channel decoder (28) for setting the coding property of the channel decoder (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission system comprising a transmitter coupled via a transmission channel to a receiver, in which the transmitter comprises a channel encoder for encoding source symbols into coded symbols according to a coding property, and in which the receiver comprises a channel decoder for deriving reconstructed source symbols from the coded symbols received from the transmission channel, the transmission system further comprises transmission quality determining means for deriving a transmission quality measure, and coding property setting means for setting the coding property to a value dependent on the transmission quality measure.The present invention also relates to a transmitter and a receiver for use in such a transmission system. The invention further relates to a transmission method.Such transmission systems can be used in applications where the quality of the transmission channel shows considerable variations. To enable a virtual error free transmission over such a transmission channel, in the transmitter the source symbols are encoded using a channel encoder according an error correcting code having error correcting capabilities. In the receiver the source symbols are reconstructed by a channel decoder. Useful codes can include convolutional codes and several types of block codes such as Reed-Solomon codes. Also a combination of a convolutional code with a block code is often used.The ratio between the number of source symbols and the number of channel symbols of such a code is called the rate of the code. The error correction capabilities of such a code depend heavily on the rate of the code. In case of a transmission channel with a strongly varying transmission quality the rate of the used channel code should be chosen to obtain virtually error free transmission at the worst channel conditions. This leads to a loss of useful transmission capacity when the transmission quality is high.To prevent this loss of transmission capacity, the transmission system can set the at least one coding property e.g. the rate of the channel encoder, in dependence on the transmission quality. If a Viterbi decoder is used as channel decoder, the transmission quality measure can be derived from the likelihood measures used in the Viterbi decoder.Other quality measures can e.g. be constituted by a number of detected transmission errors per unit of time.The problem to be solved by the present invention is how to derive a reliable quality measure despite of rapidly changing channel
