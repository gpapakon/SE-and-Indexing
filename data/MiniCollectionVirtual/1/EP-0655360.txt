<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a hinged flap (10) for closing an opening giving access to a filler cap connected to a filler pipe for a motor vehicle fuel tank, of the type including a moving panel (12) mounted in a hinged fashion on a structural element of the vehicle about an axis (X-X) substantially parallel to the plane of the panel (12) and means for elastically returning the panel to a first stable position of closing the opening and a second stable position for access to the opening, characterised in that the means (14) for hinging the panel (12) include a moving slide (26) in the form of a cylindrical annular sector (28) which is fixed to the panel (12) by a first one (30) of its longitudinal end edges and include a fixed slide (56), the body of which is fixed to a structural element of the vehicle and includes a housing (60) in the form of a cylindrical annular sector forming the slideway, an open end of which accommodates the slide (26, 28), the second longitudinal end edge (32) of which can move inside the slideway (60) between two opposed angular positions associated with the two stable positions of the panel (12).

Hinged flap (10) for closing an aperture giving access to a filling head connected 
to a motor vehicle fuel tank filler pipe, and the type having a movable panel (12) 

mounted so as to be hinged on an element of the structure of the vehicle about an 
axis (X-X) substantially parallel to the plane of the panel (12), and means of 

returning the panel elastically to a first stable position of closure of the aperture and 
a second stable position of access to the aperture, characterised in that the means 

(14) of hinging the panel (12) include a movable slide (26) in the form of a cylindrical 
annular sector (28) which is fixed to the panel (12) by a first one (30) of its 

longitudinal end edges and include a fixed cheek (56) whose body is fixed to an 
element of the structure of the vehicle and includes a housing (60) in the form of a 

cylindrical annular sector forming a channel, an open end of which receives the 
slide (26, 28), whose second longitudinal end edge (32) is able to move inside the 

channel (60) between two opposite angular positions associated with the two stable 
positions of the panel (12). 
Hinged flap according to Claim 1, characterised in that the first longitudinal end 
edge (30) of the slide (26, 28) is fixed to the internal face (20) of the panel (12). 
Hinged flap according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the slide (26, 
28) has a radial flange (38) formed so as to project on one (36) of its cylindrical 

faces and a radial face of which includes a cam profile (42), in that the housing (60) 
of the cheek (56) forming a channel has a complementary part (68) which slidably 

receives the flange (38), and in that the cheek has a cam follower element (84) 
which is mounted so as to cheek inside the body (56, 58) of the cheek in a direction 

parallel to the axis (X-X) of the channel (60, 68) and which is elastically forced (86) 
in cooperation with the cam profile (42) carried by the radial flange (38) of the slide 

(26, 28).  
 
Hinged flap according to Claim 3, characterised in that the cam profile (42) has, 
arranged successively from the first longitudinal end edge (30) towards the second 

longitudinal end edge (32) of the slide (26, 28, 38), a first recess (44) defining the 
first stable position of the panel (12), a first ramp (46) procuring an effect of elastic 

return of the panel (12) to its first stable position, a second ramp (48), of orientation 
opposite to that of the first ramp (42), procuring the effect of elastic return of the 

panel (12) to its second stable position, and a second recess (50) defining the 
second stable position of the panel (12). 
Hinged flap according to Claim 4, characterised in that the cam profile (42) is 
extended, beyond the second recess (50), by a third ramp (54), of the same 

orientation as the second ramp (46), enabling the locating finger (84) to be passed 
when the slide (26, 28) is introduced into the channel (60). 
Hinged flap according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the radial 
flange (38) is formed so as to protect on the convex cylindrical face (36) of the slide 

(26, 28). 
Hinged flap according to any one of Claims 3 to 6, characterised in that the body 
of the cheek (56) is a casing in two parts (58, 70) separated by a joint face (72) 

perpendicular to the axis (X-X) of the channel (60). 
Hinged flap according to Claim 7, characterised in that the joint face (72) extends 
substantially at the middle of the complementary part (68) of the housing forming a 

channel (60) which slidably receives the radial flange (38) with its cam profile (42). 
Hinged flap according to any one of Claims 3 to 8, characterised in that the radial 
flange (38) is formed at one (40) of the axial ends of the slide (26, 28).
