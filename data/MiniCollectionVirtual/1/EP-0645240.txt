<ABSTRACT>
A motor-vehicle window (1) made of laminated glass is provided with several antenna wires (2, 3, 4) having a diameter of 15 to 50  mu m, these being arranged parallel to each other and being almost invisible to the naked eye. In order to manufacture such an antenna window, the antenna wires (2, 3, 4) are arranged and fixed to an intermediate support skin provided with an adhesive layer consisting of the same thermoplastic polymer as the interlayer (intermediate layer) of the laminated-glass window (1). By means of the intermediate support skin, the wires (2, 3, 4) are transferred onto one of the two individual glass sheets forming the laminated-glass window. After removing the intermediate support skin, the two individual glass sheets and the thermoplastic skin forming the interlayer are converted, in the usual way, into a laminated-glass window (1).

Process for the production of a laminated glass glazing having one or
more metal wires incorporated into the intermediate, thermoplastic layer,

characterized in that the metal wire or wires (2, 3, 4) are deposited in
the desired, geometrical arrangement on an intermediate support film (24),

provided with an adhesive coating (32) formed from the same thermoplastic
polymer as the intermediate layer (43) of the laminated glass glazing, are

fixed under the effect of heat and pressure, are transferred with the aid
of the intermediate support film (24) to one of the glass sheets (40)

forming the laminated glass glazing (1) and then, following the removal of
the intermediate support film (24), the glass sheets (40, 41) and the

intermediate layer (43) are transformed in the conventional manner by a
subsequent treatment into a laminated glass glazing (1).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the metal wires
deposited on the intermediate support film provided with the thermoplastic

adhesive coating are fixed thereto with the aid of a heated pressure roller.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the metal wire or
wires (2, 3, 4) are oriented above the intermediate support film (24)

provided with the adhesive coating (32) and are heated by the application
of a voltage to the ends of the wire sections to be deposited and are

embedded in the adhesive coating (32) of the intermediate support film (24).
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that the contacting of
the metal wires (2, 3, 4) with a view to the heating of the wires takes

place as a result of the passage of a direct current with the aid of guiding
and supporting rollers (13, 35).
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the metal wires (2, 3, 4), prior to being embedded in the adhesive

coating (32) of the intermediate support film (24), are connected to connecting
tongues (5, 16, 17).
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that the connecting
tongues (16, 17) are welded to the metal wires (2, 3, 4) by friction welding

using a tool (18, 19) subject to ultrasonic vibrations. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that several metal wires (2, 3, 4), preferably of tungsten, having a diameter

of 15 to 50 Âµm are simultaneously fixed, at distances of 2 to 5 mm,
to the intermediate support film (24).
Process according to at least one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that, for the transfer of the wires to the glass sheet, said glass sheet

is preheated to an adequate temperature for the softening of the thermoplastic
adhesive coating applied to the intermediate support film.
Application of the process according to any one of the claims 1 to 8 to
the manufacture of a laminated glazing having one or more antenna wires

incorporated into the intermediate thermoplastic layer.
Application according to claim 9, characterized in that the antenna
connection tongues (5) are used for the contacting of the antenna wires

(2, 3, 4) with a view to the heating of said antenna wires prior to their
incorporation in the adhesive thermoplastic layer (32) of the intermediate

support film (24).
Application according to one or more of the claims 1 to 9, characterized
in that the metal wire or wires (2, 3, 4) are deposited and fixed in

endless wire state to an intermediate, endless support film (24), whose
individual sections (37) are separated in order to form prefabricated

antenna components, in such a way that the wires (2, 3, 4) are firstly
sectionalized under the effect of electric power and then the intermediate

support film is totally or partly separated at the intervention of a
stamping or mechanical cutting tool at this location. 
Process for the production of prefabricated components having one or
more metal wires and to be incorporated into the intermediate thermoplastic

layer of a laminated glass glazing, characterized in that the metal wire or
wires are unwound from reels and taut, are provided with electrical connection

tongues at predetermined distances, then deposited in the desired
geometrical arrangement on a continuous, intermediate support film provided

with an adhesive coating (32) formed from the same thermoplastic polymer as
the intermediate layer of the laminated glass glazing and are fixed to the

support film under heat and pressure action, and that the continuous support
film is subdivided into individual sections forming the prefabricated

components.
Process according to claim 12, characterized in that several wires are
simultaneously fixed to the intermediate support film.
