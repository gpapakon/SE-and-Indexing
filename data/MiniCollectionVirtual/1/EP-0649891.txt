<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an organosilicon compound
as an additive for controlling release properties of a silicone
release coating
composition that cures to form a release coating. More
specifically, our invention gives raise to a cured release
coating which exhibits optimal release values against
tacky substances and which does not impair the residual
adhesion of tacky substances.Cured films with excellent release properties
for tacky substances can be formed on the surface of a
substrate such as paper, cardboard, laminated paper,
synthetic plastic films, fabrics, synthetic fibers, and
metal foils, by coating the substrate with an
organopolysiloxane-based silicone release coating
composition and then by curing the composition.A general problem associated with silicone
release compositions has been in the extremely low
peel-strength values. As a result, it is necessary to
add controlled-release additives (CRAs) to these
compositions to enhance the peel strength of their
cured release coatings. These CRAs are exemplified by
the MQ silicone copolymers taught in JP-A 49-27033
[27,033/74] and JP-A 59-84953 [84,953/84] which consist
of the R3SiO1/2 unit and the SiO4/2 unit wherein R denotes
monovalent hydrocarbon groups having no more than 2
carbons. Another CRA is the MQ silicone copolymer
taught in JP-A 53-29678 [29,678/78] which consists of
the R3SiO1/2, (CH2=CH)R2SiO1/2, and SiO4/2 units where R
again denotes monovalent hydrocarbon groups having no
more than 2 carbons.The addition of these CRAs to silicone
release compositions serves to increase the peel
strength of cured release coatings previously below 20
gf/5 cm, for example, in applications with seals,
labels, and pressure-sensitive adhesive tape. However, 
the addition of CRA also can cause substantial
migration of the silicone into the tacky substance, and
significantly impairs its residual adhesion. Moreover,
since MQ silicone copolymers are solids at room
temperature, their addition to silicone release coating
compositions increases the composition viscosity, and
degrades the coating properties of the composition. EP-A-0 641 819 which has to be regarded as a prior art
reference under Article 54 (3) and (4) EPC for the
contracting states DE, FR, GB, discloses a method for the
preparation of an organosilicon polymer having the
structure:

wherein each R1 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, R2 is an
alkylene group, R3 is selected from hydrogen atom, an
alkenyl group or a hydroxyl group, m is zero or greater and
n is 1 or more,
