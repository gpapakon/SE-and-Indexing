Process for the preparation of polymers which 
contain polyurethane and/or polyurea groupings and 

comprise finely divided fillers by reaction of compounds 
which contain at least two hydroxyl and/or amino groups 

with at least difunctional isocyanates, if appropriate in 
the presence of catalysts, and mixing with suitable 

fillers, characterized in that 

a) active charcoal or expanded clay in the form of 
granules which have a high surface area and are as finely 

divided as possible, carbon black or silicic acid having 
a specific BET surface area of 50 to 400 m
2
/g are used as 
fillers, 
b) the compounds containing hydroxyl and/or amino 
groups and the isocyanates are each intimately mixed 

separately with the finely divided fillers at a temperature 
at which the reaction components are present in 

liquid form, in amounts such that free-flowing powders 
are obtained, 
c) the resulting powders are mixed in the stoichiometrically 
required amounts and 
d) the powder mixture is subjected to the action of 
shearing forces, if appropriate at elevated temperature. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that pyrogenically produced or precipitated silicic acid 

is used. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that silicic acid having a hydrophobized surface is 

used. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the starting compounds A  

 
are each mixed with the desired fillers B in a weight 

ratio of A:B of 95:5 to 60:40. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that aliphatic or aromatic di- 

or polyalcohols, aliphatic or aromatic di- or polyamines, 
aminoalcohols or polysiloxanes having at least two or 

more hydroxyl or amino groups, which compounds are liquid 
at room temperature or melt without decomposition at 

temperatures up to 250°C, are used as reaction partners 
for the isocyanate. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that aliphatic or aromatic di- 

or polyisocyanates which are liquid at room temperature 
or melt without decomposition at temperatures up to 250°C 

are used as the isocyanates. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that isophorone diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, 

dicyclohexylmethane 4,4'-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane 
4,4'-diisocyanate or toluylene-2,4/2,6-diisocyanate are 

used as the isocyanates. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the alcohol or amine 

component is admixed to a catalyst which is known per se 
and accelerates the polyurea or polyurethane formation 

reaction. 
Process according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that, in process stage d), the 

reaction mixture is exposed to the action of shearing 
forces by treatment in a double-roll mill, a kneader, an 

injection moulding machine or an extruder.
