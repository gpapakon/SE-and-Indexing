<ABSTRACT>
Ceramic extrusion tool, for the production, for example, of aluminium sections, containing materials from the series of oxide ceramics and non-oxide ceramics, such as zirconium-dioxide-reinforced alumina or sialons. The radius R1 of the edges between the surface of the tool facing the extruded material and the guide surface is less than 0.3 mm.
