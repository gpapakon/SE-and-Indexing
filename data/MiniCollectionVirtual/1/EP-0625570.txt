<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the production of dried algal biomass from 
spirulina, and consists in separate steps of culture growth. The first 

step is carried out in a reactor having a nutrient medium and receiving 
photons in the range of 1500 to 200 lux. Once the required optical 

density is achieved, the culture is subjected to a second step of 
culture growth in a nutrient and natural water. The initial optical 

density is 0.1 to 0.5. Once the desired optical density is achieved, the 
culture is harvested, filtered, washed and dried.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
production of dried algal biomass from Spirulina. It is generally known that spirulina is a 
micro alga which contains valuable nutrients and 
is rich in proteins. Further, spirulina has an 
excellent vitamin complex which includes beta 
carotene (provitamin A) B₁,B₂,B₆, B₁₂,C,E and H 
(biotin) vitamins. Spirulina has also been shown 
to possess gama linolenic and alpha linolenic 
acids, which are very essential materials in 
combating diseases. It is known that spirulina possesses various 
strains such as spirulina maxima, spirulina platensis, 
spirulina subsalsa and spirulina fusiformis. 
Strangely, most of the work hitherto conducted and 
reported in literature are on maxima and platensis-strains, 
and that very limited work has been conducted 
or reported in literature on spirulina fusiformis. 
Work on spirulina maxima has been reported in Appl. 
Microbiol Biotechnol (24,1, 47-50) 1986 Coden. Such 
a work is related to the mass culture of spirulina  
 
maxima in sea water, and with particular reference 
to the effect of nitrogen source on biomass yield. 
According to the report, spirulina maxima strain 
4 MX was cultured outdoors from September 1984 to 
August 1985 using 6 PVC ponds, each with 3m² of 
illuminated surface. From July to August 1985, 
3 concrete ponds of 10m² surface area were also used. 
Sea water was supplemented with a nutrient medium 
containing NaHCO₃, KNO₃ or urea, K₂HOP₄ or H₃PO₄ 
and Fe EDTA. The mean annual biomass yield using 
urea as the nitrogen source was substantially less 
in comparison to the standard bicarbanate medium. 
On sea water and nitrate, the yield was further 
reduced to 5.2 g/m²/day. Japanese patent no.61031095 
discloses a process for the preparation of viscous 
polysaccharide from spirulina subsalsa. Such a 
process consists in inoculating spirulina subsala 
into a nutrient medium containing NaHCO₃, Mg SO₄,A5 
solution, K₂HOP₄,CaCl₂, NaNO₃, Fe SO₄, NaCl, EDTA 
and wherein the A5 solution consisted of H₃BO₃, 
MnCl₂,ZnSO₄, 7H₂O and H₂SO₄. Cultivation was effected 
under 4000 lux of fluorescent light. The alga was 
collected and heated at 90°C in an aqueous solution 
containing NaCl and Na₂CO₃.  It is known to grow stock culture on agar 
slants using an alkaline nutrient medium containing 
nitrates and phosphates with a sub-culturing time 
of 30-40 days. Such a culture is transferred to 
glass carboys for further culturing using the same 
medium with a subculturing time of 30-40 days. The 
liquid stock cultures are

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of dried algal 
biomass from spirulina which comprises in a first 

step of culturing spirulina in a first reactor having 
a nutrient containing sodium bicarbonate, sodium 

nitrate, dipotassium phosphate, trace elements such 
as zinc and vanadium in an aqueous medium and receiving 

photons in the range of 1500 to 2000 lux, to produce 
an innoculum having an optical density in the range 

of 0.8 to 1.2 measured at 420 namometers, subjecting 
the innoculum to a second step of culturing by introducing 

the innoculum into a second reactor being larger than 
the first reactor and having exposure to sunlight for 

receiving photons in the range of 4000-6000 lux, said 
second reactor having a nutrient and natural water, the 

initial optical density of the culture being in the 
range of 0.1 to 0.8 measured at 420 namometer, harvesting 

the culture at an optical density of 1 to 1.2, filtering, 
washing and drying the culture to obtain the required 

algal biomass. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the first 
step of culture production is carried out at a temperature 

of 25 to 35°C. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 
&
 2 wherein the 
amount of sodium bicarbonate in the nutrient medium 

is approximately 10 gms. per litre. 
A process as claimed in claim 1-3 wherein the 
light absorption in the first reactor is selected 

at a wave length between 450-870 namometers. 
A process as claimed in claim 1-4 wherein the 
concentration of nitrogen released from the sodium 

nitrate contained in the nutrient medium in the range 
of 40 mg/lt. to 500 mg/lit is used in the second reactor. 
A process as claimed in claim 1-5 wherein the 
agitation of the innoculum in the second reactor is 

effected at a speed of 5-25 cm/sec. 
A process as claimed in claim 1-6 wherein the 
washing is effected using a series of washing filters 

having a mesh-size ranging from 50 mesh - 400 mesh. 
A process as claimed in claim 1-7 wherein the 
drying is effected at a temperature in the range of 

110° - 210°C.
