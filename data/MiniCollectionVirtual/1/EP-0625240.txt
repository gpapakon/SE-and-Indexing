<ABSTRACT>
The light shade comprises two flat structures (1) arranged one behind the other, each of which consists of adjacent webs (B) with areas (2; 3) of varying translucence joined together by intermediate strips (Z), also of optional translucence. The webs (1) consist preferably of a fabric produced on a loom with programmed data for the size and translucence of the individual regions.

<CLAIMS>
Rolling up and unrolling device for the actuation 
of a light screen for window surfaces, comprising two 

sheet-like structures which are arranged one behind the 
other, can be adjusted vertically by rolling up and 

unrolling and have zones of varying light permeability 
made of flexible material, in the case of which a separate 

rolling-up cylinder is provided for each upper end 
of the two sheet-like structures, said cylinders being 

arranged one beside the other and drive means being 
provided for the cylinders, these comprising at least one 

motor or at least one hand crank mechanism, characterized 
by two winding-up tubes (14, 15) which are spaced apart 

one beside the other, are intended for the sheet-like 
structures and are mounted rotatably at their ends, a 

first of the tubes (14) being coupled at one end to a 
drive (A), while the tube ends remote therefrom are each 

mounted freely rotatably in a gear wheel (17 or 18), said 
gear wheels being in engagement with one another and, on 

a predetermined radius, each having a laterally projecting 
carry-along member (21, 22), the latter, for their 

part, each passing into engagement with stops (21' and 
22'), provided at the ends of the tubes (14, 15), after 

a rotation of the respective tube by not more than 360°, 
such that, after rotation of the first tube (14) by not 

more than 360°, the gear wheels (17, 18) are made to 
rotate in opposite directions and, after a rotation of 

the gear wheel (18), assigned to the second tube (15), by 
not more than 360°, the second tube (15) is also made to 

rotate, the light-screening degree being set while only 
the first tube rotates, and the two sheet-like structures  

 
of the light screen rolling up or unrolling by a certain 

distance when the two tubes rotate. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the two gear wheels (17, 18) are pushed against the 

bearing housing by spring force and thus braked.
