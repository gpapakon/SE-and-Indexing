<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic dispenser (10) for dispensing 
viscous heated fluids, such as hot melt adhesives. A fixed 

pole (50) extends from a fluid chamber (20). The coil (46) 
is located about a portion of the fixed pole (50) and spaced 

from the fluid chamber to isolate the coil from the fluid 
flow path of the adhesive. The coil is insulated from the 

heat which is conducted from the adhesive as well as 
provided with a heat sink (88) for dissipating heat. A 

plunger (32) is mounted within the fluid chamber for 
reciprocal movement therein to open and close dispensing 

orifice in response to the field generated by the coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a fluid dispenser, such 
as for the dispensing of viscous fluids, such as adhesives, 
sealants and caulks. More particularly, this invention is 
directed to an electromagnetically actuated fluid dispenser 
for dispensing heated fluid materials such as, for example, 
hot melt adhesives. It is common in the dispensing of adhesives to use a 
pneumatic actuated dispenser, whereby a supply of air is 
used to move a plunger in reciprocal movement, such that a 
shutoff needle connected to the plunger is moved from or 
moved to a seat to permit or stop the dispensing of a 
pressurized fluid adhesive. To overcome deficiencies of 
pneumatic dispensers, electromagnetic dispensers have been 
developed wherein a plunger is driven open by an 
electromagnetic field and closed by a spring biasing means. When the coil of an electromagnetic dispenser is 
energized, the current passing therethrough generates heat 
due to the resistance of the windings of the coil. 
Specifically, the heat generated is a function of the 
current squared and the resistance (I²R) of the windings. As 
the magnitude of the current passing through the windings 
increases and/or the length of time the current passing 
through the windings increases, i.e., longer actuation (on 
cycle) with a shorter off cycle, more and more heat is 
generated, thus raising the temperature of the coil. If the  
 
heat generated causes the temperature to rise too high, the 
insulation of the coil may degrade and break down, which may 
eventually cause the dispenser to fail. This problem is 
compounded by the fact that in the dispensing of heated 
fluid materials, such as adhesives commonly known as hot 
melt adhesives, the fluid material itself may transfer 
additional heat to the coil. This additional heat increases 
the temperature of the coil, thus decreasing the allowable 
temperature rise that can be tolerated by the coil resulting 
from the current passing through the windings. For example, 
it is not uncommon for hot melt adhesive application 
temperatures to be in the range from about 121°C (250°F) to 
about 218°C (425°F) or higher. As the application 
temperature of the adhesive increases, more heat is 
available to be transferred to the coil. Thus the amount of 
heat that can be generated by the current passing through 
the coil in order to avoid exceeding the coil insulation 
rating is decreased. As such, the allowable energy 
available to drive the plunger is reduced. This may limit 
the range of application due to reduced
