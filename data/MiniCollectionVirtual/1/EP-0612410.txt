<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for scanning an analog, periodical measurement signal affected with a phase jitter and which should be acquired in advance. A measurement value is recorded per individual signal and each ulterior measurement value recording is delayed by a time unit, so that each measurement value is recorded in advance in a fixed time grid; the moment in time of the beginning of the signal in the time grid is detected and the corresponding recorded measurement value is stored.

<CLAIMS>
A process for scanning an analog, periodically appearing
measuring signal (S1 to S3) with phase jitter, wherein one

measured value is taken per individual signal and each
subsequent taking of a measured value will be delayed by one

time unit, wherein

a measuring point counter (5) will be set to a count zero
at a time predetermined by the start of a previous event,

to be scanned, of the measuring signal (S1 to S3),
the beginning of each measuring signal (S1 to S3) will be
detected by a trigger signal,
after each taking of a measuring point, the count of the
measuring point counter (5) will be incremented by one,
the respective new count of the measuring point counter (5)
will be transferred to a counting-down delay counter (7),


which is started by a measuring signal repeat clock
obtained from the measuring signal and
which detects the pulses of a clock generator (6) in
a counting-down manner,
during the counting-down process of the delay counter (7)
the very count will be held at which the trigger signal is

generated,
each count zero of the delay counter (7) will cause a
measured value to be taken, and
the held count of the delay counter (7) in each case will
be stored associated to the measured value taken.
