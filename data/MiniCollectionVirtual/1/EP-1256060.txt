<ABSTRACT>
A method of synthesizing translation tables includes the step of setting up at least one register for storing information controlling access to a plurality of memory spaces. A virtual address is generated which includes a pointer to selected information in the register controlling access to a selected one of the memory spaces. The selected information is accessed at the pointer from the register and a physical address to the selected one of the memory spaces is generated from the information accessed from the register.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHODS FOR SYNTHESIZING TRANSLATION TABLES AND SYSTEMS USING THE SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates in general to electronic appliances and in particular to circuits, systems and methods for information privatization in personal electronic appliances.DESCRIPTION OFTHE RELATED ARTHandheld personal electronic appliances have become increasingly popular as new technologies have allowed for the production of affordable devices with a high degree of functionality. One such device is the portable digital audio player, which downloads digital audio data, stores those data in a read-writeable memory, and converts those data into audio on user demand. The digital data is downloaded from a network or retrieved from a fixed medium, such as a compact disk, in one of several forms, including the MPEG Layer 3, ACC, and MS Audio protocols. An audio decoder, supported by appropriate firmware, retrieves the encoded data from memory, applies the corresponding decoding algorithm and coverts the decoded data into analog form for driving a headset or other portable speaker system.In order to prevent the unauthorized download of copyrighted material, such as music segments, some means of controlling the operation of a the personal appliance is desirable. This could be implemented for example through the issuance of passwords or software kernels authorizing download the relevant information. The passwords or software must be secured to prevent end user copying, distribution and tampering. Moreover, the audio decoder may be operating from proprietary firmware which must also be protected against copying or tampering. 

 In sum, what are needed are methods, circuits and systems for securing information in personal digital appliances. To this end, the ability to secure this information should not depend on where in the appliance it is stored, whether it be in memory internal or external to the primary processing chip. Moreover, implementation of security should not waste resources, such as the available memory space, which could be used more directly for processing operations. Additionally, the security methods and hardware should be applicable to a wide range of different system configurations.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to the principles of the present invention, a system is disclosed which includes a central processing unit operating in response to a set of instructions for processing information. An interface is included which provides access to selected circuitry

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED:
1. A method of synthesizing translation tables comprising the steps of: setting up at least one register for storing information controlling access to a plurality of memory spaces; generating a virtual address including a pointer to selected information in the at least one register controlling access to a selected one of the memory spaces; accessing said selected information at said pointer from the at least one register; and generating a physical address to the selected one of the memory spaces from the information accessed from the at least one register-
2. The method of Claim 1 wherein the selected information comprises access permissions.
3. The method of Claim 1 wherein the selected information comprises cacheability and bufferability bits. 4. The method Claim 1 wherein the at least one register comprises a first register for storing access permissions associated with each of the memory spaces, a second register for storing a cacheability bit associated with each of the memory spaces and a third register for storing a bufferability bit associated with each of the memory spaces. 5. The method of Claim 1 wherein the selected information accessed from the at least one register comprises a base address to at least one second level register controlling access to a selected part of a selected one of the memory spaces and said step of generating a physical address comprises the substeps of: accessing selected information in the at least one second level register using the base address and a table index from the virtual address; and generating the physical address from the selected information accessed from the at least one second level register and page index bits from the virtual address. 

6. The method of Claim 1 wherein said information includes for each of the memory spaces a pair of access permission bits, a bufferability bit and a cacheability bit.
7. A method of performing an emulated translation table walk comprising the steps of: emulating a translation register including a plurality of entries populated with descriptors; emulating an index register storing indices associated with the entries of the emulated translation register; pointing to the emulated translation register with a translation base pointer; generating an address including index bits to the emulated translation register; comparing the index bits from the address with the indices stored in the index register; and selectively accessing a corresponding descriptor in the translation table in response to said step of comparing.
8. The method of Claim 7 wherein said step of generating an address comprises the step of generating a virtual address forcing a miss to an associated cache- 9. The method of Claim 7 wherein the descriptors comprise selected physical address bits and access permissions and said method further comprises the steps of: determining from the permissions from the descriptor selectively accessed from the emulated translation table whether a corresponding access to memory is allowed; and if the access is allowed, generating a physical address to a location in memory using the physical address bits from the accessed descriptor.
10. The method of Claim 7 and further comprising the steps of: 


 populating selected entries of the translation register with second level base addresses; emulating a second level translation register including a plurality of entries populated with second level descriptors; emulating a second level index register populated with indices to corresponding entries in the second level translation register; accessing the second level translation register with a base address from the translation register; comparing index bits from the virtual address with indices in the second level index register; and in response to said step of comparing, selectively accessing a second level descriptor from the corresponding entry in the second level translation table.
11. The method of Claim 10 wherein the second level descriptors comprise selected second level physical address bits and second level access permissions and said method further comprises the steps of: determining from the second level permissions of the descriptor selectively accessed from the emulated second level translation table whether a corresponding access to memory is allowed; and if the access is allowed, generating a physical address to a location in memory using the second level physical address bits from the accessed second level descriptor.
12. A system comprising: a memory partitioned into a plurality of memory spaces accessible by a set of physical addresses; a register; and control circuitry operable to: store an access permission to a corresponding one of said memory spaces in said register; 


 access the permission from said register in response to a virtual address; and generate a physical address to the corresponding one of the memory spaces from the accessed permission. 13. The system of Claim 12 wherein said control circuitry comprises a microprocessor.
14. The system of Claim 12 and further comprising a second register accessible by said control circuitry for storing cacheability bits associated with each of said memory spaces. 15. The system of Claim 14 and further comprising a third register accessible by said control circuitry for storing bufferability bits associated with each of said memory spaces.
