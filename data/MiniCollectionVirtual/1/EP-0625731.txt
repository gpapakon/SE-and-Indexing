<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatic image on a image member (1) already 
containing a loose dry first toner image is toned with a second toner, 

for example, a toner of a second and different color from the first toner 
image. The toning is accomplished using a developer having a high 

coercivity permanently magnetized carrier and toner which is moved 

through a development zone by a rapidly rotating core (104 inside a 
sleeve (106) on which the developer moves. Pole transitions caused by 

the rapidly moving core (104) make the high coercivity permanently 
magnetized carrier move vigorously in a wave motion having 

alternating crests and troughs. Scavenging of the first toner image is 
prevented by separating the sleeve from the image member sufficiently 

that the crests of the developer do not touch the image member during 
the toning process. An alternating electrical field is applied between 

the sleeve (106) and the image member (1) to enhance development.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the formation of toner images on an 
image member. Although not limited thereto, the invention is 
particularly useful in a method and apparatus for forming two or more 
different color toner images on a single frame of an image member. U.S. Patent No. 4,546,060, Miskinis et al issued October 8, 
1985, discloses a method of developing electrostatic images using a 
developer including a "hard" magnetic carrier having a coercivity of at 
least 300 gauss when magnetically saturated and exhibiting an induced 
magnetic moment of at least 20 EMU/gm of carrier when in an applied 
field of 1000 gauss (1 gauss =  103 / 4Ï€  A / m). preferred embodiment of this carrier having a 
much higher coercivity in the neighborhood of 2000 gauss is 
commercially used to provide the highest quality electrostatic image 
development presently available. In this method, developer made up 
of such hard magnetic carrier particles and oppositely charged toner 
particles is moved at the speed and direction of the image by high 
speed rotation of a magnetic core within a shell or sleeve on which the 
developer moves. Rapid pole transitions on the sleeve cause the high 
coercivity carrier to experience a torque. "Strings" or "chains" of the 
carrier rapidly flip on the sleeve to move the developer on the shell in a 
direction opposite to that of the rotating core. In contrast, a low 
coercivity, "soft" magnetic carrier will intemally magnetically reorient 
in response to the pole transitions and not experience a torque adequate 
to cause the carrier to flip. U.S. Patent No. 5,001,028 to Mosehauer et al is 
representative of a number of references describing a process in which 
a photoconductive image member is uniformly charged and imagewise 
exposed to create an electrostatic image. Dry toner is applied to the 
electrostatic image to create a toner image. Usually in this process, 
discharged area development is used. Thus, the toner applied is of the 
same polarity as the electrostatic image. Deposits in the areas of 
lowest charge (the discharged areas) form a toner image having a 
density which is greatest in the portions of the image receiving the 
greatest exposure.  
 Without fixing the first toner image, the image member is 
usually uniformly charged, again with a charge of the same polarity as 
the original image and imagewise exposed to form a second 
electrostatic image generally in the portions of the image member not 
covered by the first toner image. The second electrostatic image is 
toned,
