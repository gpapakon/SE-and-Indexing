<ABSTRACT>
A process for making an adhesive dressing comprises passing a 
backing strip (16) continuously through an adhesive application zone 

(20); 
applying an adhesive (22) to one side of the backing strip as it 

passes continuously through this zone, to form an adhesive coated 
strip; and passing the adhesive coated strip from the adhesive 

application zone continuously through an adhesive conditioning 
zone (40,82), to condition the adhesive. Before or after the adhesive 

conditioning zone, the strip is passed continuously through a pad 
application zone (30,72) where pads (32) are applied to the adhesive 

coated 
side of the backing strip in such fashion that portions of the 

adhesive are not covered by the pad(s), thereby to form a padded 
strip. The padded strip is fed continuously and directly to a 

release paper application zone (50), where release paper (52,54) is 
applied 

over at least the adhesive, to form a continuous adhesive 
dressing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making an adhesive
dressing.CH-A-676197 discloses a process for making an adhesive
bandage, in which adhesive is continuously applied to a
backing strip and a release paper is then applied to cover
the adhesive. In a subsequent operation, spots of adhesive
are applied to a different region of the backing strip, and
absorbent pads are then adhered to such spots of adhesive.US-A-2862846 discloses the manufacture of adhesive bandages
from a laminate comprising a carrier paper, a plastic film,
an adhesive layer on the plastic film, and a silicone coated
release paper.According to the invention, there is provided a process for
making an adhesive dressing, which comprises
passing a backing strip continuously through an adhesive
application zone;applying an adhesive to one side of the backing strip as
it passes continuously through this zone, to form an
adhesive coated strip;passing the adhesive coated strip from the adhesive
application zone continuously through an adhesive
conditioning zone, to condition the adhesive;before or after the adhesive conditioning zone, passing
the adhesive coated strip continuously through a pad
application zone where at least one pad is applied to the
adhesive coated side of the backing strip in such fashion
that portions of the adhesive are not covered by the pad,
thereby to form a padded strip; and feeding the padded strip continuously and directly to a
release paper application zone, where release paper is applied
over at least the adhesive, to form a continuous adhesive
dressing.The process of the invention is thus characterized thereby that
it is continuous, ie the strip passes continuously and directly
from one zone to the next, without intermediate taking up thereof
into a roll.The adhesive may be a pressure sensitive adhesive.In one embodiment of the invention, the adhesive may be a curable
adhesive such as a solvent or emulsion based adhesive. Curing
of the adhesive may then take place in the adhesive conditioning
zone.The pad may then be of curable foam material, as hereinbefore
described, with the adhesive coated strip passing through the pad
application zone before passing through the conditioning or
curing zone, so that curing of the foam material is also effected
in the conditioning or curing zone. In one version of this
embodiment, the foam material may be applied continuously to the
backing strip, eg so that a single pad extending along the strip
is thereby provided. However, in another version, the foam
material may be

A process for making an adhesive dressing,
comprising


passing a backing strip (16) continuously through an adhesive
application zone (20);
applying an adhesive to one side of the backing strip (16) as it
passes continuously through this zone (20), to form an adhesive coated

strip;

characterized in that it comprises
passing the adhesive coated strip from the adhesive
application zone (20) continuously through an adhesive conditioning

zone (40), to condition the adhesive;
before or after the adhesive conditioning zone (40), passing the
adhesive coated strip continuously through a pad application zone (30)

where at least one pad (32) is applied to the adhesive coated side of
the backing strip in such fashion that portions of the adhesive

are not covered by the pad, thereby to form a padded strip; and
feeding the padded strip continuously and directly to a
release paper application zone (50), where release paper (52, 54) is applied

over at least the adhesive, to form a continuous adhesive
dressing.
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the adhesive is a pressure sensitive curable adhesive, with

curing of the adhesive then taking place in the adhesive
conditioning zone (40). 
A process according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the pad (32) is of curable foam material, with the adhesive coated

strip passing through the pad application zone (30) before passing
through the conditioning zone (40), so that curing of the foam

material is also effected in the conditioning zone (40).
A process according to Claim 3, characterized in that
the foam material is applied continuously to the backing strip (16).
A process according to Claim 3, characterized in that

the foam material is applied intermittently to the backing strip (16).
A process according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the pad (32) is of absorbent fabric and is applied as a continuous

strip to the adhesive coated strip (16).
A process according to Claim 2, characterized in that
individual absorbent fabric pads (32) are applied intermittently to

the adhesive coated strip (16).
A process according to Claim 6 or Claim 7,
characterized in that the adhesive coated strip passes through

the curing zone (40) before application of the pad(s) (32) thereto.
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the adhesive is a hot-melt adhesive applied to the backing strip (16)

at elevated temperature, with cooling of the adhesive being
effected in the conditioning zone (40) and with the application of the 

pad (32) to the adhesive coated strip being after the adhesive has
been cooled.
A process according to Claim 9, characterized in that
the pad (32) is of curable foam material, with the process including

passing the padded strip through a curing stage (40) prior to entering
the release paper application zone (50).
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10
inclusive, characterized in that it includes passing the

zone (50) to a cutting zone (60), and cutting it into individual dressings

of a desired shape and size in the cutting zone.
A process according to Claim 11, characterized in that
