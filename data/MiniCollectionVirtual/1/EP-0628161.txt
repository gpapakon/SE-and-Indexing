<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the detection of leaks from inside 
pressurized conduits, such as pipes or hoses. More specifically 
it utilizes a change in the impedance between conductors to detect 
leaks. Fluid leaks, such as gaseous leaks, from conduits or lines, 
i.e. pipes or hoses, transporting high pressure fluids can be 
unsafe, dangerous to the environment, and costly. There is a need 
for the detection of leaks in such conduits over their entire 
length. A common method of detecting leaks in pressurized conduits is 
based on point probes which continually monitor for fluid or which 
register vibrational changes in the conduit. For detecting leaks 
along a long length of pipe or hose, the large number of required 
point probes makes these methods impractical. This invention employs a layer of pliable conductive material 
between a conduit and signal carrying elements disposed along the 
length of the conduit. The signal carrying elements comprise a 
series of at least two insulated parallel electrical conductors 
disposed longitudinally along the conduit in which adjacent 
portions of the conductors are exposed along the side next to the 
pliable conductive material. Preferably the parallel conductors 
are embedded in a ribbon tape. The pliable conductive material is a layer of conductive tape 
wrapped around the conduit. The pliable material can be a carbon  
 
loaded polymer such as carbon loaded polyester, silicone or 
tetrafluoroethylene tape. Upon leakage of gas from the pressurized gas conduit, there 
will be a momentary ballooning of the conductive pliable layer, 
which upon contact with the exposed portion of the signal carrying 
elements, alters the resistance between said conductors making up 
the signal carrying elements. This change is measured directly by 
impedance changes. Figure 1 depicts a cutaway side view and end view of a conduit. Figure 2 depicts the cutaway conduit and end view with a layer 
of insulation around it. Figure 3 depicts the cutaway conduit of Figure 2 with a 
pliable conductive material around it. Figure 4 depicts a ribbon cable used to wrap around the 
construction of Figure 3. Figure 4a is a side view and Figure 4b is a top view of the 
ribbon cable. Figure 5 shows the ribbon cable wrapped around the 
construction of Figure 3. The invention will now be described in detail with reference 
to the drawings, and with reference to gas as the fluid. In Figure 1, the pipe or conduit 10, which can be made of 
metal, such as steel, or plastic, carries the gas, which can
