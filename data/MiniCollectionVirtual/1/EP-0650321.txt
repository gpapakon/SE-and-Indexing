<ABSTRACT>
The rotary valve (5) may be set to one of three positions: milking, backwashing and cleaning. In the first two positions the connector stubs (11, 12, 13) are in sealed contact with the end faces (9 and 10) of the rotary valve (5) and between the half-casings (2, 3) which can move axially in relation to each other there is a channel (20) providing a connection between the interior (4) and the atmosphere. Leaks can thus flow away freely. Before the entire milking machine is rinsed with a cleaning solution, the rotary valve (5) is moved into the cleaning position shown on Fig. 3. In this position, a recess (22) in the end face (9) of the rotary valve (5) allows the half-casing (2) to move with respect to half-casing (3) into a sealing position. The cleaning solution flowing through the milking machine passes via the first connector stub (11) and the recess (21) into the interior (4) of the casing (1) and leaves the interior (4) via the recess (22) and the second connector stub (12). Here, both the interior (4) and the rotary valve (5) are deeply cleaned.

Milking installation with a valve for rinsing teat 
cups, whereby the valve consists of a housing in the interior 

of which is arranged a movable valve body (6), 
whereby the housing (1) is provided with three connectors 

(11, 12, 13) of a which a first connector (11) is connected 
with the teat cups, a second connector (12) is connected 

with the milk line and a third connector (13) is 
connected with a rinse line (13) and the valve body in 

milking position connects the first (11) and the second 
connector (12) and shuts off the third connector (13) and 

in rinse position connects the connector (11) with the 
third connector (13) and shuts off the second connector 

(12), 
characterised in that
 a cleaning position of the 
valve body (6) is provided in which the first connector 

(11) and the second connector (12) are connected to the 
interior (4) of the housing (1), the third connector (13) 

is shut off and a channel (20), which connects the interior 
(4) to the atmosphere, is closed in this position. 
Milking installation according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 the housing (1) comprises two housing 
halves (2, 3) between which in the milking position and 

rinsing position a channel (20) connecting the interior 
(4) of the housing (1) with the atmosphere is released,  

 
whereby the valve body (6) is designed as a rotary slide 

valve on whose plane faces (9, 10) the connectors (11 ,12 
13) opening up into the interior (4) of the housing (1) 

can be brought into a sealing position, the rotary slide 
valve (5) is provided with channels (7, 8), which in the 

milking position connect the first (11) and the second 
connector (12) and in the rinsing position connect the 

first connector (11) and the third connector (13), the 
plane faces (9, 10) each being provided with a recess (21, 

22) into which the first and second connectors open up in 
the rinsing position and which in this position permit the 

housing half (2) to be moved against the housing half (3) 
into a position where the channel (20) is sealed. 
Milking installation according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised 
in that
 the housing halves (2, 3) are under pretension 
with one another by means of a spring (19). 
Milking installation according to one of the claims 1 
to 3, 
characterised in that
 a bearing journal (14) of the 
valve body (6) is provided with a toothed pinion (16) outside 

of housing (1) which toothed pinion (16) is connected 
to a toothed rod (17) which can be moved by means of a 

lifting cylinder (18).
