<ABSTRACT>
Nucleation of a refractory metal such as tungsten is initiated on a substrate of TiN without the use of silane by introducing hydrogen into a CVD reactor before the introduction of the reactant gas containing the metal, brought to reaction temperature and to reaction pressure. The process is most useful for CVD of tungsten onto patterned TiN coated silicon semiconductor wafers. Alternatively, hydrogen is introduced in a mixture with the metal containing gas, such as WF6, and maintained at subreaction pressure, of for example 100 mTorr, until the substrate is stabilized at a reaction temperature of approximately 400  DEG C or higher, to cause the dissociation of hydrogen on the wafer surface, then elevated to a relatively high reaction pressure of, for example, 60 Torr at which nucleation is achieved. Also, the reduction reaction that deposits the tungsten film proceeds without the need for a two step nucleation-deposition process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
nucleation of tungsten in chemical vapor deposition 
processes, and more particularly, to processes for 
the nucleation of tungsten without the use of 
silane onto titanium nitride films on semiconductor 
wafers. In the manufacture of silicon integrated 
circuits, there is a need to perform a process on 
semiconductor wafers that will plug vias, form 
interconnections and make contacts on patterned 
wafers. The dimensions of the holes or trenches 
that must be plugged or filled with conductive, 
usually elemental metallic, material is typically 
in the submicron regime, or <10-6 meter. Because of 
the narrow dimensions and steep stepped sides of 
these vias and contact holes, physical deposition 
processes such as sputtering are often 
unsatisfactory and ineffective. One convenient and effective process for 
filling these vias and contact holes with  
 
conductive material and for forming contacts has 
been found to be the chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) of elemental tungsten (W). This process, 
which usually involves a reduction reaction of 
tungsten hexafluoride vapor (WF6), results in 
adequate film conformality in vias and contact 
holes. WF6 can be directly reduced by a substrate 
itself to cause the tungsten to coat the substrate 
with a film. This can occur when the substrate 
reacts with the WF6, reducing it directly, or where 
the substrate yields monatomic hydrogen. It has 
been found, however, that with a substrate such as 
one of silicon, a limited deposition thickness of 
tungsten is achieved because the reaction slows 
substantially as the initial film coats the wafer. 
When this occurs, further deposition can be 
achieved only with the availability of another 
reducing agent, such as H2 or SiH4. The typical CVD tungsten reaction 
involves use of hydrogen gas (H2) as a reducing 
agent for the WF6 gas. The WF6 and H2 gases are 
usually premixed in an inlet region of a cold wall 
reactor and then directed onto the surface of a 
wafer to be coated, which is maintained at an 
elevated reaction temperature of, for example, 
450°C. When the mixed gases contact the wafer at  
 
this temperature, the WF6 and H2 react producing 
elemental tungsten (W) which is deposited onto the 
wafer as a film, and a hydrogen fluoride (HF) 
byproduct gas that is carried away from the wafer 
surface by the gas flow within the processing 
chamber. U.S. Patent 4830891 discloses an example of the 
above-described method for selective deposition of metal 
thin film, in particular
