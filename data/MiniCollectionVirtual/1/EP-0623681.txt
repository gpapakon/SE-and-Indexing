<ABSTRACT>
To reduce measurement time, methods of operating an amperometric, 
enzyme electrode (14) before steady state is established are described. 

In a first method current is monitored for a short time after injection 
of buffer solution into a cell (1) containing the electrode and the 

values 
used to establish a background current via time extrapolution using a 

least squares technique. Sample is then injected into the cell, and the 
current again measured. The analyte (e.g. glucose, lactic acid, uric 

acid) concentration is determined by subtracting the background current 
extrapolated to the measurement time (t₃) from the measured current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
measuring sample by enzyme electrodes, more particularly to 
a method for measuring a specified component in a body fluid, 
for example, blood, blood plasma, urine and so on by using the 
enzyme electrodes. Recently enzyme electrodes have been employed for 
measuring a specified component in a body fluid, e.g. blood. 
For example, in a quantitative analysis of glucose, a glucose 
sensor which is formed by fixing a membrane of glucose 
oxidizing enzyme on the surfaces of hydrogen peroxide electrodes 
is employed. After a measurement voltage is applied to 
the electrodes of glucose sensor, buffer solution is charged 
in a reaction container so that the ends of glucose sensor can 
be immersed. An electric current between the electrodes 
becomes stable and then a sample is injected in the buffer 
solution. The quantity of glucose can be obtained by measuring 
the change in the electric current between electrodes from the 
time point of sample injection. Since it has taken 1-5 minutes for the electric 
current to become stable after charging the buffer solution, 
it was necessary to wait for long time to commence the  
 
injection of sample and the measurement, which resulted in a 
greatly inefficient operation. A method for stabilizing early electric current 
between enzyme electrodes has been proposed in Japanese patent 
laid-open publication No. 62-294954. In this method, a higher 
voltage than measurement voltage is applied to the enzyme 
electrodes and then the measurement voltage is applied 
thereto. According to the method, although the stable point 
of the current becomes a little early, it needs to wait for 
the current to become stable nevertheless. The present invention has been developed to 
substantially eliminate the above-described disadvantages. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a method for measuring sample by enzyme electrodes in which 
it is possible to commence a measurement of sample early and 
to improve the efficiency of operation. In order to achieve the aforementioned object, there 
is provided a method for measuring sample by enzyme electrodes 
comprising the following steps of: charging a buffer solution 
in a reaction container so that the enzyme electrodes can be 
immersed in the buffer solution; sampling current values 
between enzyme electrodes, to which a voltage is applied, at 
predetermined-time intervals; predicting a decreasing curve 
of current on the basis of the current values; injecting a  
 
sample in
