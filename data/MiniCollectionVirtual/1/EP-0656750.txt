<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing reduced fat foods is provided which employs a fragmented starch hydrolysate. A granular starch hydrolysate or a debranched amylopectin starch precipitate is fragmented to form an aqueous dispersion that is useful in replacing fat in a variety of food formulations. A wet blend of the fragmented starch hydrolysate and a hydrophilic agent is dried. The dry blend can be easily redispersed in water to form a particle gel useful in replacing fat and/or oil in a food formulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF PREPARING REDUCED FAT FOODS, USING STARCH HYDROLYSATEThis invention relates to food formulations in which at least a portion of the fat and/or oil is replaced by a carbohydrate. U.S. Patent No. 4,510,166 (Lenchin, et al.) discloses converted starches having a DE less than 5 and certain paste and gel characteristics which are used as a fat and/or oil replacement in various foods, including ice cream and mayonnaise. The converted starches are described as dextrins, acid-converted starches (fluidity starches), enzyme-converted starches and oxidized starches. It is also disclosed that if the converted starches are not rendered cold-water soluble by the conversion, they are pregelatinized prior to use or cooked during use.A product bulletin entitled "Paselli SA2; The Natural Alternative to Fats and Oils" (Avebe b.a., Foxhol, Holland, Ref. No. 05.12.31.167 EF) discloses the use of a low-DE-hydrolysate (DE less than 3) made from potato starch as a replacement for fifty percent of the fat with an amount of the low-DE-potato starch hydrolysate plus water (starch hydrolysate at 28% dry solids) equal to the amount of fat replaced.U.S. Patent Nos. 3,962,465 (Richter, et al.) and 3,986,890 (Richter, et al.) disclose the use of thermoreversible gels of a starch hydrolysate (formed by enzymatic hydrolysis) as a substitute for fat in a variety of foods, including cake creams and fillings, mayonnaise and remoulades, cream cheeses and other cheese preparations, bread spreads, pastes, meat and sausage products, and whipped cream.The preparation of ready-to-spread frostings having reduced levels of calories is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,761,292 (Augustine, et al.). The patent discloses a frosting which contains (a) about 40 to 85 weight percent sugar, at least about 20SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

weight percent of which comprises fructose; (b) about 1 to 12 weight percent of a granular starch having a cold-water solubility of greater than 50 weight percent and a fat content of less than 0.25 weight percent; (c) about 5 to 30 weight percent fat; and (d) about 10 to 30 weight percent water. The patent also discloses, at column 5, lines 25-38, that the preferred frostings contain 8 to 18 weight percent fat in comparison to conventional frostings which routinely contain about 18 to 30 weight percent fat.This invention relates to a method of preparing a dry blend of a major amount of a fragmented starch hydrolysate capable of forming a particle gel in aqueous dispersion and a minor amount of a hydrophilic agent selected
