<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for determing the visibility in thick fog, by means of a lidar and a visibility sensor. A pulsed laser beam is transmitted by a first transmission channel, and laser light scattered back from the fog is received by a first receiving channel, the first transmission channel and the first receiving channel being aligned parallel to one another. Laser light scattered back is additionally received by the lidar, by means of a second receiving channel, and this second receiving channel is aligned at a divergent, acute tilt angle with respect to the first transmission channel. This results in it being possible to separate the laser light which has been scattered once from the laser light which has been scattered a plurality of times and in consequence makes it possible to draw conclusions on the type of fog, and, finally, on the visibility. Further conclusions are possible as a result of investigating the depolarisation of the back-scattered laser light in accordance with an advantageous development.

Method for determining the visibility distance
in thick fog by means of a lidar, by which a pulsed laser

beam is transmitted by means of a first send channel and
laser light scattered back by the fog is received by

means of a first receiving channel, the first send
channel and the first receiving channel being aligned

parallel to each other, characterized in that
back-scattered laser light is additionally received by

the lidar by means of a second receiving channel and this
second receiving channel is aligned at a divergent, acute

tilt angle to the first send channel, which angle is
optimised in such a way that only a small proportion of

single-scattered light is received by means of the tilted
receiving channel, while the intensity of the double- and

more than double-scattered light is high.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a second send channel is provided which is aligned

parallel to the first send channel.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that a third receiving channel is provided which is

aligned parallel and axially symmetrically with respect
to the first send channel or a notional line extending in

the middle between the two send channels, and by means of
the first receiving channel only back-scattered light

with a first polarisation plane is received, while by
means of the third receiving channel only back-scattered

light with a second polarisation plane which extends
perpendicularly to the first polarisation plane is

received, linearly polarised light having a defined 
polarisation plane being transmitted by means of the send

channel or send channels.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that a fourth receiving channel is provided which is

aligned axially symmetrically to the second receiving
channel with respect to the first send channel or a

notional line extending in the middle between the two
send channels.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that the send and receiving channels are

associated with one another by means of a multiplexer.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that a third and a fourth send channel are provided, each

one of the send channels being associated with one of the
receiving channels.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that by means of an evaluation process,

back-calculation to extinction is carried out from the
lidar signals received, for which purpose a comparison is

made between the lidar signal received by means of the
first receiving channel and the lidar signal received by

means of the second receiving channel, and a ratio is
thereby formed between the sum of the intensity of the

total back-scattered light and of the double-scattered
light.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that by means of an evaluation process, back-calculation

to extinction is carried out from the lidar signals
received, for which purpose a ratio is formed between the

value of the lidar signal received by means of the first
receiving channel and the value of the lidar signal

received by means of the second receiving channel, and a
ratio is formed between the value of the lidar signal

received by means of the third receiving channel and the received by means of the third receiving channel and the value of the lidar signal received by means of the fourth receiving channel.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in that on the basis of the comparison of the values of the lidar signals received, between the first and third and the second and fourth receiving channel, the polarisation plane of the back-scattered light is detected and thus conclusions are drawn as to the type of fog.
