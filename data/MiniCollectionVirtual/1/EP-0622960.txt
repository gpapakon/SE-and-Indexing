<ABSTRACT>
A motion detection circuit in which the contours 
in the current frame of the image and two frames before are 

detected by two discrete contour detection circuits, the 
signal detected by a one frame period difference detection 

circuit is band-limited by a low pass filter, and then 
converted to a one frame motion signal according to the 

contour signal of the current frame, the signal detected by 
the two frame period difference detection circuit is 

similarly converted to a two frame period motion signal 
according to the contour signal of the current frame, an 

output control circuit then detects an area corresponding 
to the unnecessary part of the motion detection area due to 

the two frame period motion signal from the contour signals 
of the current frame and two frames before; this detection 

signal cuts off the two frame motion signal in meaningful 
areas, and whichever of the one frame motion signal and the 

output-controlled two frame motion signal is greater is 
then selected by the maximum value selector and output as 

the motion signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motion 
detection circuit for detection subject motion in a video 
signal. Video signal processing devices using a motion 
detection circuit include motion adaptive YC separators, 
which are used to separate NTSC and other composite video 
signals into luminance signal (hereafter "Y signal") and 
chrominance signal (hereafter "C signal") components, and 
sub-sampling band compression-type decoders (e.g., the MUSE 
(Multiple Sub-Nyquist Sampling Encoding) decoder used in 
the Japanese HDTV transmission system). In video signal processing devices such as these, 
image movement is detected by the motion detection circuit, 
and still and moving image processing results are mixed 
pixel by pixel based on the detection result to obtain the 
output signal. One motion detection circuit is described in 
Japanese patent laid-open publication SHO 63-169195 and in 
USP 4,884,136. This motion detection circuit detects motion  
 
based on the low band frequency component of the one frame 
period difference signal of the image and the full band 
frequency component of the two frame period difference 
signal. This method is used for the following reasons. When the video signal is an NTSC signal, the C 
signal is frequency multiplexed to the high band of the Y 
signal. As a result, the one frame period difference 
signal has a meaningful value even with still images. The 
low band frequency component must be used as the one frame 
period difference signal to avoid this effect of the C 
signal. When the video signal is a MUSE signal, the one 
flame period difference signal still has a meaningful value 
even with still images because the sub-sampling aliased 
component occurs at high frequencies. The low band 
frequency component must therefore be used as the one frame 
period difference signal to avoid the effect of the aliased 
component. Because detection of motion in the high band 
frequency component is thus not possible using the one 
frame period difference signal, a two frame period 
difference signal is also used. Motion in the full signal 
band is possible using the two frame period difference 
signal because both the NTSC and MUSE formats use a 
sequence of two frames to form a single image. With the conventional motion detection circuit, 
however, motion signals are detected outside the targeted  
 
motion area as a result of time-space expansion of the 
motion detection area from use of the two frame period 
difference signal, and spatial expansion of the motion 
detection
