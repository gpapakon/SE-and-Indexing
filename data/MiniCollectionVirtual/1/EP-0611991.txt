<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses an imaging element comprising on 
a support (i) a photosensitive layer containing an amount of silver 

halide expressed as AgNO₃ between 0.6g/m² and 2.0g/m² and hydrophilic 
colloid in a total amount between 0.5g/m² and 2.0g/m², (ii) an antihalation 

substance and (iii) TiO₂ provided under the photosensitive 
layer of the imaging element when viewed from its photosensitive side. 

There is further disclosed a method for obtaining an image according 
to the silver salt diffusion transfer process with said imaging 

element. The imaging element according to the present invention is 
less susceptible to exhausture of the processing liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging element for use in a 
silver salt diffusion transfer process and to a method for obtaining 
images therewith. The principle of the silver complex diffusion transfer process 
(hereinafter referred to as DTR process) is well known from the 
description in U.S. Pat. NO. 2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic 
Silver Halide Diffusion Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - 
The Focal Press - London and New York, (1972). In the DTR process, the silver complex is imagewise transferred 
by diffusion from a silver halide emulsion layer to an image 
receptive layer and transformed therein into a silver image 
generally in the presence of physical development nuclei. For this 
purpose, the imagewise exposed silver halide emulsion layer is 
arranged so as to be in contact with or is brought into contact with 
the image receptive layer in the presence of a developing agent and 
a solvent for the silver halide, thereby to convert the unexposed 
silver halide into a soluble silver complex. In the exposed areas of 
the silver halide emulsion layer, the silver halide is developed 
into silver which is insoluble and, hence, cannot diffuse. In the 
unexposed areas of the silver halide emulsion layer, the silver 
halide is converted into a soluble silver complex and is transferred 
to an image receptive layer wherein the silver complex formes a 
silver image generally in the presence of development nuclei. The DTR process can be utilized in a wide field such as 
reproduction of documents, making of printing plates, preparation of 
black copies, and instant photography. Particularly in reproducing documents or preparing black copies, 
an imaging element having a silver halide emulsion layer is brought 
into close contact with a positive material having an image 
receptive layer in a DTR processing solution generally containing a 
silver-complexing agent, thereby to form a silver image in the 
receptive layer of the positive material. The silver image in these 
cases is required to be pure black or bluish black in color and 
sufficiently high in density. It is also important that the silver  
 
image be high in contrast and sharpness, excellent in image 
reproducibility, and preferably high in transfer speed. In addition, 
these properties of the positive material should not be greatly 
dependent upon the processing conditions such as, for example, 
processing time and temperature. In order to produce less waste it is desirable to increase the 
quantity of photographic
