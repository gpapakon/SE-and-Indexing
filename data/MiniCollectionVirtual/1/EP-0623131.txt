<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel alkyl derivatives of 
trazodone endowed with pharmacological activity, pharmaceutical 
compositions containing them, a process for preparing them and 
intermediate compounds useful in their preparation. Trazodone of formula (T) is a drug which has been known for 
over twenty years and has been widely used as an antidepressant 
On the other hand, some Authors also reported some 
diazepine-like clinical actions for this drug (Burger's 
Medicinal Chemistry, 4th ed. (1981)). Although it has still to be completely understood, it is 
almost certain that its mechanism of action is related to the 
interference of trazodone with the system of aminergic 
transmission of the central nervous system. Chemical binding studies have shown that trazodone exhibits a 
certain degree of interference with the following receptors: 
The action on the adrenergic receptors (alpha 1 and alpha 
2) seems to be responsible for some sporadic side effects of 
trazodone, such as hypotension and priapism, while it does not 
have a part, as far as our present knowledge is concerned, in 
the psychopharmacological activities. Now, it has been surprisingly found that the compounds of 
the formula (I) 
 
wherein only one of R, R', R" and R"' is 1-3 C alkyl and the 
others are H, 
and the acid addition salts thereof with physiologically 
acceptable organic or inorganic acids, have a reduced affinity for adrenergic receptors (see the 
following table): 
alpha 1 (% inhibition) serotonine 2 (% inhibition) C = 10⁻⁷M C = 10⁻⁵M C = 10⁻⁷M C = 10⁻⁵M (I) R=R'=R"=R'''=H (trazodone)499878103 (I) R=R'=R'''=H; R"=CH₃379669100 (I) R=R'=R"=H; R'''=CH₃20856898 (I) R=R"=R'''=H; R'=CH₃269159100 (I) R'=R"=R'''=H; R=CH₃2788 62100     Furthermore, the compounds of the formula (I) are superior 
to trazodone even as far as the DL₅₀ is concerned 
DL₅₀ (I) R=R'=R"=R'''=H (trazodone)≥ 200 (I) R=R'=R'''=H; R"=CH₃300 (I) R=R'=R"=H; R'''=CH₃≤ 600 (I) R=R"=R'''=H; R'=CH₃≤ 300 (I) R'=R"=R'''=H; R=CH₃≤ 600 Therefore, it is a first object of the present invention to 
provide a compound of the formula (I) wherein only one of R, 
R', R" and R"' is 1-3 C alkyl and the others are H, and the 
acid addition salts thereof with physiologically acceptable 
organic or inorganic acids. Examples of suitable physiologically acceptable inorganic 
and organic acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, 
sulphuric, lactic, succinic, tartaric, acetic, citric, benzoic, 
naphthalene-2-sulfonic, adipic, and pimelic acid. Preferably, the compounds of
