<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor type differential pressure measurement 
apparatus comprising a measuring diaphragm whose periphery 

is fixed and two measuring chambers each having a 
predetermined spacing along both surfaces of said measuring 

diaphragm. The apparatus detects differential pressure 
within the allowable limit of measurement, but when an 

overpressure is applied, the measuring diaphragm is 
directly backed up by the wall of the measuring chamber to 

prevent the diaphragm from being damaged by the 
overpressure. Accordingly, the apparatus requires no 

additional protective mechanism against overpressure. 
The apparatus comprises an additional chamber 
accompanied by an overhang provided in such a manner that 

the effective area thereof may be larger than that of the 
opening of the chamber. Accordingly, the force which is 

exerted to the joint portion between the silicon substrate 
and the support substrate upon application of an 

overpressure can be greatly reduced. 
Two measuring chambers each having a predetermined 
spacing are provided along both sides of the measuring 

diaphragm. Accordingly, the exterior of the semiconductor 
differential pressure measuring apparatus according to the 

present invention may be exposed to open air, and thereby 
no particular pressure-resistant casing is necessary. In  

 
further detail, the sensor portion need not be covered with 

a pressure resistant vessel as in the apparatuses of the 
conventional type in which the measuring pressure is 

applied externally to the sensor. 
The semiconductor type differential pressure 
measurement apparatus according to the present invention 

comprises a conductor connection formed by introducing 
impurities into the joint surface between the silicon 

substrate and the support substrate, and one end thereof is 
further connected to a strain detector element. 

Accordingly, no pressure-resistant hermetic sealing is 
necessary in extract an electric signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compact and low
cost differential pressure measurement apparatus having a
simple structure and yet elaborate, which can manufactured
without any special pressure resistant casing or any
protective mechanism against overpressure, and free of
pressure-resistant hermetic terminals.The present invention also relates to a semiconductor
type differential pressure measurement apparatus comprising
a measuring diaphragm provided on both sides thereof with
two measuring chambers each having a predetermined spacing
such that they may be immediately backed by the wall of the
measuring chamber when an over pressure is applied to the
measuring diaphragm; it directly utilizes the strain
detector for measuring the pressure difference as the
detector element for overpressure, and therefore is a
simple and inexpensive semiconductor type differential
pressure measurement apparatus yet highly reliable for
detecting overpressure.The present invention further relates to a
semiconductor type differential pressure measurement
apparatus manufacturing method which is inexpensive and can 
manufacture diaphragms with highly precise thicknesses.The present invention also relates to a method for
manufacturing a semiconductor type differential pressure
measure apparatus by sacrificial layer etching method
whereby there is no possibility diaphragm to the substrate.FIG. 1 is an explanatory drawing of a prior art
structure. Reference may be made, for example, to FIG. 1 of
JP-A-59-56137 (the term "JP-A-" as referred to herein
signifies "a published unexamined Japanese patent
application").Referring to FIG. 1, a flange 2 and another flange 3
are fitted and assembled on both sides of a housing 1 by
means of welding or the like, and an inlet 5 for
introducing a high pressure fluid with a pressure of PH and
an inlet 4 for a low pressure fluid with a pressure of PL
are provided on both of the flanges 2 and 3. A pressure
measuring chamber 6 equipped with a center diaphragm 7 and
a silicon diaphragm 8 is established inside the housing 1.The center diaphragm 7 and the silicon diaphragm 8 are
each separately fixed on the wall of the pressure measuring
chamber 6 to divide the chamber 6 into two parts. Back
plates 6A and 6B are provided on the wall of the pressure
measuring chamber 6 in such a manner that they face the 
center diaphragm 7. The periphery of the center diaphragm
is welded to the housing 1.The silicon diaphragm 8 is made entirely from a single
crystal substrate. Four strain gauges 80 are formed on
