<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum suction casting apparatus 
of the invention injecting a molten metal 

into a mold through vacuum suction, comprises: 
(a) a vacuum vessel having at least 

one opening in its bottom; (b) a mold arranged 
within the vacuum vessel and having 

a sprue runner opened to the opening of the 
vacuum vessel and running along at least a 

portion of a side surface of a cavity within 
the mold, a cavity communicating with the 

sprue runner through a plurality of filler passages, 
and a concave-shaped suction port 

formed near a riser; and (c) a pressure reducing 
device communicating with the vacuum 

vessel. When the pressure reducing device 
evacuates the interior of the vacuum vessel, 

the cavity is rapidly evacuated to cause a 
molten metal to be filled into the cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum casting
apparatus and a vacuum casting method using the apparatus. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and a
method for casting articles of poor castability such as complicated-shaped
or thin stainless steel casting or heat-resistant cast steel,
etc.In the production of a thin cast article having a thin
portion of 5 mm thick or less, the fluidity of a melt introduced into
a mold cavity is rapidly decreased because a part of the melt is
rapidly cooled and easily solidified upon coming into contact with
the internal wall of the mold cavity. This results in defects such as
insufficient filling of the mold cavity, etc. In the production of a
cast article of complicated shape, air and gases generated from the
mold material are likely to be introduced into the resulting cast
articles as defects such as blow holes. Thus, a defectless cast article
which is thin and has complicated shape is difficult to be produced.As a method of producing a thin cast article having
complicated shape, a lost wax process has been known. In this
method, a ceramic mold is heated to 700-900Â°C prior to the filling 
of the cavity with a melt to retard the cooling of the melt
introduced into the cavity, thereby keeping the melt highly
flowable. However, since a ceramic mold is expensive, the
production cost of a thin cast article having a complicated shape
would be extremely high.As an alternative method, JP-A-60-56439 discloses a
gypsum mold provided with a cavity, runner, etc., in which a
refractory filter having a gas permeability higher than that of the
gypsum is disposed in an area ranging from the neighborhood of a
last-filled portion of the cavity to the outside surface of the gypsum
mold, thereby enhancing the evacuation capability to increase the
fluidity of the melt and prevent the defect due to gas. The gypsum
mold is produced by hydration-setting a gypsum slurry and drying
the hardened gypsum. This method utilizing the gypsum mold, as
is the case of the lost wax process mentioned above, has been
known as one of the precision casting methods for producing a cast
article of a high dimensional accuracy, and has been used for
producing dies, parts for machines, artistic handicrafts, etc.However, since the production of a gypsum mold
includes the steps of kneading, pouring, hydration setting, pattern
draw, drying, etc. takes a long period of time, over 48 hours, the
productivity of this method is poor. Further, since the gas
permeability of the gypsum mold is
