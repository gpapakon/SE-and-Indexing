<ABSTRACT>
A fuel system for supplying fuel to a compression ignition engine 
includes an accumulator (10) in which fuel is stored at high pressure. 

The fuel being supplied to the accumulator from a high pressure cam 
actuated pump (21) which includes pumping plungers (23) operable in 

timed relationship with the associated engine. The apparatus also 
includes a distributor member (11) having a delivery passage (12) which 

can register with outlet ports (13) in turn. Valve means (16, 20) is 
provided and this is operable in a first setting to connect the high 

pressure pump (21) to the delivery passage (12) so that fuel is supplied at 
a low rate to the associated engine and a second setting in which the 

accumulator (10) is connected to the delivery passage to achieve a high 
rate of fuel delivery to the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel system for supplying fuel to the injection
nozzles in turn of a multi-cylinder compression ignition engine, the
system including an accumulator in which fuel is stored under pressure,
means including a delivery passage for distributing fuel to the injection
nozzles in turn, valves means operable to connect said accumulator with
said delivery passage when it is required to supply fuel to the engine and
pump means for charging the accumulator.An accumulator based fuel system has the advantage over a conventional
cam actuated plunger pump system in that it is possible to provide an
ideal fuel pressure at all engine speeds and loads unlike a plunger based
system.EP 0406592 described a fuel system incorporating an accumulator and a
high pressure pump, the pump being arranged to supply fuel at high
pressure for a main injection, a subsequent lower pressure pilot injection
being drawn from the accumulator.It is well known that benefits are obtained by supplying an initial
quantity of fuel to the combustion chamber of a compression ignition
engine at a reduced rate followed by the main quantity of fuel at an
increased rate and the object of the present invention is to provide a fuel
system of the kind specified in a form in which the initial flow of fuel to
the engine can be controlled.According to the invention in a fuel system of the kind specified said
pump means comprises a cam actuated plunger pump which is driven in 
timed relationship with the associated engine and said valve means has a
first setting in which the output of the cam actuated plunger pump is
directed to the delivery passage so as to deliver fuel to the engine at a
reduced rate, the valve means having a second setting in which the
accumulator is connected to the delivery passage to provide an increased
rate of fuel delivery to the engine.Examples of systems in accordance with the invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-
Figure 1 is a sectional side elevation of one example of part of a fuel
system in accordance with the invention,Figure 2 is shows various fuel injection rate diagrams which can be
obtained from the systems described herein, andFigures 3 and 4 show modifications to the system shown in Figure 1 with
Figure 4 showing a series A-E of possible valve positions.Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings there is shown at 10 an
accumulator in which liquid fuel is stored at a pressure which is
sufficiently high to open the fuel pressure actuated valve members

<CLAIMS>
A fuel system for supplying fuel to the injection nozzles in turn
of a multi-cylinder compression ignition engine comprising an

accumulator (10) in which fuel is stored under pressure, means including
a delivery passage (12) for distributing fuel to the injection nozzles in

turn, valve means (18, 20, 42) operable to connect said accumulator (10)
with said delivery passage (12) when it is required to supply fuel to the

engine and pump means (21) for charging the accumulator, said pump
means (21) comprising a high pressure pump having a pumping plunger

(23) actuated by a cam (25) in timed relationship with the engine,
characterized in that the valve means has a first setting in which the fuel

delivered by the pump (21) is directed to the delivery passage (12) so as
to deliver fuel to the engine at a reduced rate, and the valve means

having a second setting in which the accumulator (10) is connected to
the delivery passage to provide an increased rate of fuel delivery to the

engine.
A fuel system according to Claim 1, characterized in that said
valve means (18, 20, 42) has a third setting in which the communication

of the pump (21) and the accumulator (10) with the delivery passage (12)
is broken and the delivery passage is connected to a drain.
A fuel system according to Claim 2, characterized in that said
valve means comprises an ON/OFF valve (20) connected between the

high pressure pump (21) and the accumulator (10) and a two way valve
(16) having a first port (15) connected to the delivery passage (12), a

second port (19) connected to a point intermediate the high pressure 
pump and the ON/OFF valve (20) and a third port which is connected to

drain.
A fuel system according to Claim 2, characterized in that said
accumulator is divided into first and second sections (10A, 10B) and said

valve means comprises a first two way valve (20A) having a first port
connected to the high pressure pump (21), a second port which is
