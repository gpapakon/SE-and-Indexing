<ABSTRACT>
An original feeding device (A) for feeding OHP 
originals (1) to the display stage of an overhead projector 

is capable of transportation control suitable 
for OHP projection. The originals (1) are transported by 

a conveying film (2) onto the display stage (101). In order to 
stop the original at the center of the display stage, 

after the original is detected by the registration 
sensor, the conveying film is advanced by an amount 

equal to the sum of the distance from the registration 
sensor (14) to the display stage, a half of the length of 

the display stage and a half of the length of the 
original.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an original
feeding device according to the preamble of claim 1, which can be fitted on an overhead
projector.In the known overhead projector, the user who
is making presentation has to manually place the
transparent sheets, or the originals for such overhead
projector, one by one on the display stage of the
overhead projector, and such sheet replacing operation
has been an obstacle to the presentation. Also, the
already projected sheets and those to be projected are
often mixed up on the table, and such situation has
also been an obstacle to the presentation.Such drawbacks will be resolved by a device for
automatically feeding the sheets onto the display
stage of the overhead projector (OHP), but such device
has not been realized because of the following
difficulties.In such OHP original feeder, for feeding the
OHP originals, the center of the display stage should
preferably coincide with that of the original to be
displayed in order to facilitate observation of the
observers, but such requirement cannot be met if the 
originals are variable in size or if vertically oblong
originals and laterally oblong originals are mixedly
present.On the other hand, in the OHP original feeder
for feeding the OHP originals by means of a conveying
film, such convey film represents a considerable portion
of the cost. For this reason, the gaps between the
originals are generally shortened in order to economize
the amount of the convey film to be used. However, if
the gaps are made too short, there will result a
drawback that, while an original is projected on the
display stage, the next original is partly projected.Also, in such OHP original feeder for feeding
the OHP originals by means of the convey film, if a user
cuts off the power supply while erroneously leaving his
OHP originals on the feeder and if the next user tries
to feed his originals without noticing such left
originals, the original feeding becomes impossible
because of the limit in the number of originals
receivable in the feeder.Also, in the OHP original feeder for feeding
the OHP originals, the user often wishes to make fine
adjustment on the stopping position of the OHP original
on the display stage.Furthermore, in the OHP original feeder for
feeding the OHP originals, the observer receives an
unpleasant impression if the original feeding is too 
fast, as the feeding is effected while the original is
projected. However, if the original feeding is too
slow, there will be required an excessively long time,
interfering with

<CLAIMS>
An original feeding device, for consecutively feeding plural
originals (1) to a display stage (101) of a projecting apparatus

for projecting an image of the original (1) placed on said
display stage (101), said display stage (101) having a length in the feeding direction which is longer than the length of said original

(1) in said feeding direction, said original feeding device comprising:

a transport means (4) for consecutively transporting said plural
originals (1) one by one onto said display stage (101);
an original length detecting means (14, 22) for detecting the
length of each of said originals (1) in the original

transport direction; and
a control means (36, 223) for de-activating said transport means
(4), after said transport means (4) has transported the front end of one of said originals (1)

past the end
portion of said display stage (101) by an amount

corresponding to the sum of a half of the length of said
display stage (101) and a half of the length of the original

(1) detected by said original length detecting means (14,
22),
characterized in that

said control means (36, 223) is arranged to set the distance
from the rear end of a preceding original (1) on said display stage (101) to the front end of the

succeeding original (1) by calculating the result of subtracting half of
the length of the preceding original (1) detected by said original detecting means (14, 22) from half of the

length of said display stage (101), and controlling said transport
means (4) in accordance with said calculation.
An original feeding device according to claim 1, further comprising

transparent belts (2, 3) for sandwiching said originals (1)
and being transp
orted by said transport means (4), 
rollers (5a, 5b, 6a, 6b) for winding said belts (2, 3) and
a detection means (15) for detecting a mark (2a) on one of
said belts (2, 3); wherein
said control means is arranged to cause said detection means to detect
said mark by rotating said rollers (5a, 5b, 6a, 6b) by a

predetermined amount in the forward or reverse direction at the
start at the start of power supply to said original feeding

device.
An original feeding device according to claim 1, further comprising

   adjusting means for finely adjusting a stop position of the
original (1) on the display stage (101).
An original feeding device according to claim 1, further comprising

   selecting means for selecting a transporting speed of said
transporting means from a plurality of speeds, wherein said

transporting means is arranged to transport the originals (1) at the speed
selected by said selecting means.
An original feeding device according to claim 1, wherein

   the originals (1) are transparent sheets.
An original feeding device according to claim 1, wherein

   the projecting apparatus is an overhead projector (B).
