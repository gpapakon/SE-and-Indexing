<ABSTRACT>
A diaphragm for capacitance type loudspeaker is disclosed.
The diaphragm uses a conductive high polymer layer as a conductor

formed on a high molecular film of PET or the like by treating the
high molecular film in a water solvent solution containing a

conductive high molecular monomer, a chemical oxidizer and a
dopant. The conductive high molecular monomer is selected from the

group consisting of pyrrole, aniline, thiophene and derivatives
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diaphragm employed in a 
capacitance type loudspeaker. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a diaphragm for a capacitance type loudspeaker 
using a high molecular film. A capacitance type loudspeaker has a conductive film-like 
diaphragm provided between two fixed electrodes. The capacitance 
type loudspeaker utilizes the following sounding mechanism. A DC 
high voltage is applied as a bias between the film-like diaphragm 
and the fixed electrodes to form a strong electric field, and an 
AC electric field by an audio signal voltage is added to be 
superposed thereon, thus generating an electrostatic vibratory 
force to the diaphragm. This vibratory force causes the diaphragm 
to vibrate and hence generate sounds. Consequently, as is apparent from the above-described 
structure and sounding mechanism, the property and conductivity of 
the diaphragm are critical for satisfactory performance. 
Therefore, it has been a conventional practice to vapor-deposit a  
 
metal, such as aluminum, or apply a surface active agent used for 
electrostatic prevention, onto the high molecular film for 
providing optimum conductivity to the diaphragm. However, the conventional practice accompanies the following 
inconvenience. First, in the capacitance type loudspeaker, the vibratory 
force F generated to the diaphragm is expressed by 
F α eQ/d₁+d₂  
, 
with e denoting the audio signal voltage, Q denoting the charge of 
the diaphragm, and d₁, d₂ denoting the cavities between the 
diaphragm and the fixed electrodes. Practically, the required 
charge Q of the diaphragm is provided by applying a bias voltage 
E between the diaphragm and the fixed electrodes through a high 
resistance R₀. It is necessary that the minimum value of resistance R₀ at 
this point is a constant when it satisfies 
R₀C₀ > 1/2f₀  
 with f₀ 
denoting the lowest frequency of the loudspeaker and C₀ denoting 
the capacitance between the fixed electrodes and the diaphragm. 
For instance, R₀ > 40 MΩ is preferred under the conditions of 
f₀ = 25 Hz, C₀ = 500 pF. Accordingly, if a conductor of the diaphragm is a good 
conductive material having a metal, such as aluminum, vapor-deposited 
thereon, a high resistor of R₀ > 40 MΩ is required. 
Since a practically used capacitance type loudspeaker requires a 
bias voltage E of approximately 5000 V, a high resistor which can 
be safe at such a high voltage needs to be large. In addition, the 
resistor charged with a high voltage is extremely hazardous.  Meanwhile,
