<ABSTRACT>
In a constant timing valve for the discontinuous metering of a volume flow, especially the flow of cooling water flowing through the heat exchanger of a motor vehicle heating system, in order to keep the volume flow at the valve outlet (17) constant regardless of the volume flow at the inlet (16), there is a by-pass pipe (28) in the valve housing (18) from the inlet (16) to a return line (18) which is closed by a spring-loaded, pressure-controlled by-pass valve (29). The by-pass valve (29) is designed so that, when the connection between the inlet and outlet (16, 17) is not blocked, the excess volume flow passes via the return line (18), at least until a predetermined minimum pressure is attained in the by-pass pipe (28). The integrated by-pass valve (29) is coupled to the timing valve (14) in such a way that it is affected by the timing valve (14) when the latter is closed.

Cyclically operated valve for the discontinuous 
metering of a volume flow, in particular the flow of 

cooling water through a heat exchanger (10) of a motor-vehicle 
heating system, with a valve housing (15) having 

an inlet (16) and an outlet (17) and an 
electromagnetically operated valve member (26) which 

establishes the connection between the inlet (16) and the 
outlet (17) in a first position and locks it in a second 

position, characterized in that a bypass passage (28) 
leading from the inlet (16) to a return (18) is formed in 

the valve housing (15), in that a spring-loaded, 
pressure-controlled bypass valve (29) is arranged in the 

bypass passage (28), this bypass valve being designed in 
such a way that, given a connection between the inlet 

(16) and the outlet (17), a virtually constant volume 
flow that is independent of the volume flow at the inlet 

(16) flows to the outlet (17) at least when a predetermined 
minimum pressure is reached in the bypass passage 

(28), and in that the bypass valve (29) is coupled to the 
valve member (26) in such a way that it is forcibly held 

open in the second position of the latter. 
Cyclically operated valve according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the valve member (26) is seated in 

a fixed manner on a valve rod (27) actuated by an 
electromagnet (40) and interacts with a valve seat (24) 

formed in the valve housing (15), forming with the said 
valve seat a seat valve (25), in that the bypass valve 

(29) has a control cone (31) which is acted upon by the 
pressure in the bypass passage (28) and, in the opposite  

 
sense by a closing spring (32), and in that the closing 

force of the closing spring (32) and the angle of taper 
of the pressure impingement surface of the control cone 

(31) are matched to one another in such a way that the 
outflow cross-section of the bypass valve (29) is opened 

to such an extent, as a function of the pressure and the 
velocity of flow in the bypass passage (28), that the 

volume flow difference between the volume flow available 
at the inlet (16) and the constant volume flow taken off 

at the outlet (17) flows off to the return (18) at all 
times. 
Cyclically operated valve according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the closing spring (32) is designed 

as a compression spring (35) which is supported against 
the valve housing (15) and against that end of the 

control cone (31) which faces away from the bypass 
passage (28) and in that the control cone (31) is seated 

on the valve rod (27) in such a way that it can be 
displaced axially and it is pressed against an annular 

shoulder (272) formed on the valve rod (27) by the 
compression spring (35). 
Cyclically operated valve according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the control cone (31) is secured in 

an axially non-displaceable manner on the valve rod (27) 
and in that the closing spring (32) is formed by a return 

spring (46) which acts on the valve rod (27) and keeps 
the valve member (26) of the seat valve (25) raised from 

the valve seat (24) when the electromagnet (40) is not 
excited. 
Cyclically operated valve according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the return spring (46) is integrated 

into the electromagnet (40) and is there supported 
as a compression spring against an armature (45) connected 

in a fixed manner to the valve rod (27). 
Cyclically operated valve according to one of 
Claims 3-5, characterized in that the distance between 

the control cone (31) of the bypass valve (29), the said 
control cone being seated in a fixed manner on the valve 

rod (27) or resting against the annular shoulder (272),  
 

and the valve member (26) of the seat valve (25), the 
said valve member being seated in a fixed manner on the 

valve rod (27), is defined such that the control cone 
(31) of the bypass valve (29) closes the bypass passage 

(28) when the valve member (26) of the seat valve (25) is 
raised to the
 maximum extent from the valve seat (24) and 
opens it to the maximum extent when the valve member (26) 

of the seat valve (25) is seated on the valve seat (24). 
Cyclically operated valve according to one of 
Claims 1-6, characterized in that the valve housing (15) 

has a further connection (19), which is connected to the 
return (18) by a return passage (20) formed in the valve 

housing (15), and in that the bypass passage (28) opens 
into the return passage (20). 
Cyclically operated valve according to one of 
Claims 2-7, characterized in that the valve housing (15) 

has formed in it a valve chamber (21) which is divided 
into two chamber sections (211, 212) by the valve seat 

(24) of the seat valve (25), and in that the inlet (16) 
is connected by way of an inlet passage (22) and the 

bypass passage (28) to one chamber section (211), and the 
outlet (17) is connected by way of an outlet passage (23) 

to the other chamber section (212).
