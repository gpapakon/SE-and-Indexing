<ABSTRACT>
A drilling arrangement of a type using fluid for driving a reciprocating piston hammer, with respective impacting surfaces between the hammer and the drill characterised in that the drill bit has a channel following a circular path which is coaxial with the central axis of the drill bit, and a protuberance extending from the face of the hammer the protuberance following a circular path which is coaxial with the central axis of the drill bit and of a width and positioned such that the protuberance will be fully within the channel in the drill bit when the respective faces are at their impacting relative positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drilling arrangement having a reciprocating
piston hammer adapted to hammer against a drill bit of a type using a liquid for
driving said reciprocating piston hammer, with respective impacting facing
surfaces between said hammer and said drill bit.The invention has particular application to a hydraulic down-the-hole
piston hammer assembly directly acting against a drill bit which in turn is
mechanically rotated and which is adapted to use the hydraulic fluid to recover
at least in part cuttings resulting from the actions.The problem to which this invention is directed relates to the situation
where the reciprocating piston hammer is driven by a fluid at pressure and the
impacting faces between the hammer and the drill bit are within the fluid.Conventionally the fluid is water.The problem is that where the hammer is caused to strike a first end of
the drill bit, upon removal of the striking face of the hammer, there will be
caused, in view of the rapidity of the action, some cavitation which in turn will
cause, upon collapsing of voids, significant stress forces in the localised vicinity
of the impacting faces.Such an effect has the capacity to effect significant and relatively rapid
removal of parts of the material of the impacting surfaces.US-A-3403739 discloses a fluid-actuated impact tool for down-hole use
that eliminates the use of springs and increases the frequency of the impact
strokes by comparison with earlier impact tools. The face of the hammer has an
impacting surface which has a channel 16 extending across it. The purpose of
this channel is said to be to assure the passage of air or other fluid to the lower
end of the cylinder, particularly during the initial starting up of the impact tool.US-A-3180434 discloses a particular design of hammer and associated
valving that uses water as well as air as the driving fluid. The disclosure relates 
only to the piston design for controlling fluid flow.US-A-2859733 relates to the problem of fluid-actuated impact tool
damage caused by uncontrolled delivery of impact energy to the tool bit. Tool
damage is reduced by an arrangement in which the delivery of percussive
energy by the hammer is automatically decreased whenever the bit is
unsupported by a working surface.The object of the invention is to provide a drilling arrangement of the
type referred to above which has the ability to reduce the problem referred to
above.In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, the drilling
arrangement is characterised in
