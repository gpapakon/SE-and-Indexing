<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a method and a device for controlling an automatic plate exchange process in a sheet-fed offset printing machine, in which a used printing plate is removed from the gripping region of a clamping rail assigned to the leading edge of the plate cylinder and a new printing plate is then introduced into the opened gripping region, fixing of the in-register position of the newly introduced printing plate taking place before the gripping region is closed (clamped). This method is to be designed in such a way as to result in increased safety and reliability in the course of the plate exchange process. Before it is established whether the newly introduced printing plate lies in register in the gripping region of the clamping rail, it is checked whether the used printing plate has been removed from the gripping region, for which it is established whether the used printing plate is not in an in-register position with its leading edge.

Process for controlling an automatic printing plate 
change procedure in a printing press, particularly 

an offset printing press, in which a used printing 
plate is removed from the opened gripping region of 

a tensioning rail arranged relative to the print 

start of the plate cylinder and thereafter a new 
printing plate is introduced with its front edge 

into the opened gripping region and the gripping 
region is closed, wherein prior to the closure of 

the gripping region, it is determined whether the 
front edge of the new printing plate has taken up a 

register correct position with reference to the 
plate cylinder, characterised in that prior to 

bringing up the new printing plate, it is determined 
whether the used printing plate with its front edge 

does not occupy the register correct position and 
that the feed of the new printing plate only results 

once this condition is fulfilled. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the determination of whether the front edge of the 

printing plate does or does not occupy a register 
correct position is carried out at two spaced points 

on the plate cylinder separated axially one from 
another. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the determination of whether the front edge of 

the printing plate does or does not occupy a 
register correct position is carried out within a 

given time interval. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that after the closure of the  

 
gripping region of the tensioning rail arranged 

relative to the print start of the plate cylinder, a 
further determination takes place as to whether the 

new printing plate has taken up a register correct 
position and on non-fulfilment of this condition, 

opening of the gripping region takes place. 
Process at least according to Claim 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the determination of whether 

the front edge of the printing plate does or does 
not occupy a register correct position is carried 

out at the two places spaced axially one from 
another independently of one another. 
Device for carrying out the process according to 
Claims 1 to 5 with a control which is in operative 

connection with the tensioning rail arranged for 
opening and closing of the gripping region of the 

plate cylinder relative to the print start and 
furthermore is connected with a position sensing 

unit which cooperates with the front edge of the 
printing plate, characterised in that by the control 

via the positioning means, the gripping region is 
maintained in the opened position for such a time 

until at least it has been once determined that the 
used printing plate with its front edge is no longer 

sensed by the position sensing unit. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in that 
the control is in operative connection with two 

electrically interrogatable register pins installed 
in the tensioning rail arranged relative to the 

print start of the plate cylinder and spaced axially 
from one another. 
Process according to Claim 6 or 7, characterised in  
 

that the electrically interrogatable register pins 
arranged in the tensioning rail are individually 

connected with the control. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterised in that 
two indicating means are provided by means of which 

it can be determined via the control against which 
register pin the printing plate lies or does not 

lie.
