<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates, in general, to an adenovirus mediated transfer of genes to the gastrointestinal tract. In particular, the present invention relates to a method of recombinant, replication-deficient adenovirus mediated transfer of therapeutic genes to the gastrointestinal tract whereby therapeutic proteins for systemic and/or local purposes are produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general,
to use of adenovirus for transfer of
genes to the gastrointestinal tract. In
particular, the present invention relates to a
use of recombinant, replication-deficient
adenovirus in the manufacture of medicament or treatment of an animal by transfer of therapeutic genes
to the gastrointestinal tract of the animal for the purpose of
producing therapeutic proteins, locally or systemically.The use of proteins as therapeutic agents
is limited interalia by the physiologic barrier
of the gastrointestinal tract. The terms
protein, polypeptide, peptide, or segment of
amino acids are herein used interchangeably to
define a polymer of amino acids linked through
peptide bonds. Therapeutic proteins are defined
herein as proteins advantageous to an individual.
Proteins cannot be administered for therapeutic
purposes by the oral or rectal routes because
they will not generally reach the circulation in
an intact form in concentrations needed for
therapy (the proteins are degraded and/or not
absorbed). Consequently, therapeutic proteins
need to be administered systemically for example,
by the intravenous, subcutaneous, intradermal or
intramuscular routes.This problem of the administration has
been dramatically heightened by the development
of recombinant DNA technology, where it is
possible to produce many different therapeutic 
proteins, all of which have to be administered
systemically. While this may not be a major
problem for short term use, long term use (which
is the typical use for most of the recombinant
proteins) requires long term systemic
administration with all of the attendant problems
with access route (e.g., veins available,
discomfort and cost).It is known that recombinant adenoviruses
can be used to produce human protein invivo
(examples include injection of recombinant
adenovirus intravenously into the portal vein to
the liver, and intratracheal to the lung
(see Rosenfeld M et al. (1991) Science 252:431-434;
Jaffe HA et al. (1991) Clin Res 39(2) 302A;
Rosenfeld MA et al. (1991) Clin Res 39(2): 311A).
However, all of these approaches are impractical
to use for systemic administration of recombinant
proteins because they require parenteral
administration of the recombinant gene (i.e.,
intravenous, intraportal, intratracheal).The present invention circumvents this by
providing for administration of therapeutic
proteins by enteral routes by using a
recombinant, replication deficient adenovirus
containing the coding sequences of the gene of
the therapeutic protein
