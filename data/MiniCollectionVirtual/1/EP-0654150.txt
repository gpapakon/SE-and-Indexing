<ABSTRACT>
A photosensitive printing element having two radiation-sensitive layers and a process for making a flexographic printing plate from such element are disclosed. The photosensitive element contains a bottom layer which is sensitive to non-IR actinic radiation and an upper, IR-ablatable layer. After imagewise ablating the upper layer, the bottom layer is exposed to non-IR actinic radiation using the upper layer as a mask (portable conformable mask).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photosensitive printing 
element and, more particularly, to a flexographic 
element having an infrared ablatable layer capable of 
being selectively removed by a laser beam. This 
invention also relates to a process for making a 
flexographic printing plate from such an element. Flexographic printing plates are well known for use 
in letterpress printing, particularly on surfaces which 
are soft and easily deformable, such as packaging 
materials, e.g., cardboard, plastic films, etc. 
Flexographic printing plates can be prepared from 
photopolymerizable compositions, such'as those described 
in U.S. patents 4,323,637 and 4,427,749. The 
photopolymerizable compositions generally comprise an 
elastomeric binder, at least one monomer and a 
photoinitiator. Photosensitive elements generally have 
a photopolymerizable layer interposed between a support 
and a coversheet or multilayer cover element. Upon 
imagewise exposure to actinic radiation, polymerization, 
and hence, insolubilization of the photopolymerizable 
layer occurs in the exposed areas. Treatment with a 
suitable solvent removes the unexposed areas of the 
photopolymerizable layer leaving a printing relief which 
can be used for flexographic printing.  
 Imagewise exposure of a photosensitive element 
requires the use of a phototool which is a mask having 
clear and opaque areas covering the photopolymerizable 
layer. The phototool prevents exposure and 
polymerization in the opaque areas. The phototool 
allows exposure to radiation in the clear areas so that 
these areas polymerize and remain on the support after 
the development step. The phototool is usually a 
photographic negative of the desired printing image. If 
corrections are needed in the final image a new negative 
must be made. This is a time-consuming process. In 
addition, the phototool may change slightly in dimension 
due to changes in temperature and humidity. Thus, the 
same phototool, when used at different times or in 
different environments, may give different results and 
could cause registration problems. Thus, it would be desirable to eliminate the 
phototool by directly recording information on a 
photosensitive element, e.g., by means of a laser beam. 
The image to be developed could be translated into 
digital information and the digital information used to 
place the laser for imaging. The digital information 
could even be transmitted from a distant location. 
Corrections could be made easily and quickly by 
adjusting the digitized image.
