<ABSTRACT>
A sintered oxide ceramics constituted of a single component in which the number of black spots on a mirror surface, which 
surface is formed by polishing said sintered ceramics and pressing the polished surface to slide on a buff having carbon black 

sprayed thereon, amounts to 100 or under per 1 mm² when observed under an optical microscope; and a method of making 
sintered oxide ceramics having a small number of black spots as set forth in Claim 1, characterized in that oxide ceramic 

particles being 1 micron or under in average particle size and 99 % or above in purity are formed into a body and then sintered 
in the atmosphere of air, inert gas, or reducing gas at a temperature ranging from 1000 to 1500 °C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a titania or alumina ceramic body for fabrication
into vacuum chucks, vacuum tweezers, remotely controlled
hands, and other products which are used in handling Si
wafers in the semiconductor industry, as in cleaning,
transferring, and surface-treating the wafers, and which
therefore should be protected against the deposition or
adsorption of dirt and other impurities ; titania or alumina ceramic bodies for
various industrial mirrors and other devices in which the
existence of pores is to be avoided; titania or alumina ceramic bodies and materials for
pieces in the field of personal ornaments, including tie-pins,
earrings, and pendants, that are required to be
lustrous and not easily soiled.In the manufacture of the vacuum chucks, vacuum
tweezers, and the like employed in the operations for
transfer, cleaning, and surface treatment of Si wafers in
the semiconductor industry, ceramic materials have been
used with the view of avoiding the intrusion of metallic 
elements into the wafers or the contamination with such
elements. The ceramic materials used are in many cases
alumina and infrequently silicon carbide.The products fabricated from the ceramic materials
usually are used after their portions to come in contact
with Si wafers have been ground and lapped. At times pores
that the ceramic-material itself has remain exposed on the
lapped surface and attract dirt and dust. With the tendency
toward higher density and larger-scale integration of
semiconductor elements, the possibility of the dirt and
dust in the pores of the ceramic material gaining entrance
into the process of fabrication has posed a problem.To settle this problem, various less porous ceramic
materials have been studied. However, even the least
porous material has about 300 pores per square millimeter,
and it is not fully satisfactory yet to meet the requirement
of the semiconductor industry that is directed toward
much larger-scale integration.The present inventor, in an effort to solve the
problem, has found that a titania and an alumina ceramic material of a
single component sintered at a relatively low temperature
has an unusually small number of pores and has now perfected
the present invention.The invention as defined in the appended claims will be described in detail below. The essence of the invention resides in the fact that
when a fine, high-purity titania or alumina ceramic powder is chosen as
a raw material and fired below the usual firing temperature
for oxide ceramics, the
