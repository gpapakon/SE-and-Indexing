<ABSTRACT>
A solid state image device such as a CCD imager 
device includes a timing generator which generates and supplies 

a clamping circuit with, a clamping pulse for clamping 
a first signal, corresponding to one pixel, from a through 

region of a CCD shift register, and a clamping pulse for 
clamping a second signal, corresponding to one pixel, from an 

optical black region of a sensor array. Specifically, the 
clamping pulse for clamping the first signal clamps a signal, 

corresponding to a first pixel, from the through region, and 
the clamping pulse for clamping the second signal clamps a 

signal, corresponding to a second or following pixel, from 
the optical black region. An output signal from the clamping 

circuit is supplied to an A/D converter which converts the 
supplied signal at such timing as not to clamp the signal, 

corresponding to the first pixel, from the through region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid state imager
device employing a solid state imaging component called an
area sensor or a linear sensor, and more particularly to a
solid state imager device which includes a clamping circuit
for clamping an output signal from a solid state imaging
component to a reference potential.Solid state imager devices such as charge-coupled-device
(CCD) imagers have a signal processor for sampling and
holding signal charges from a charge transfer device and a
clamping circuit for clamping sampled and held signals. The
clamped signals are then supplied to an analog-to-digital
(A/D) converter which converts the signals into digital
signals for digital signal processing. Heretofore, a signal
voltage higher than the reference potential, generally set to
the maximum level of the dynamic range, of the A/D converter
is applied to the A/D converter. The application of such a
high signal voltage tends to operate the A/D converter in
error, break the converted digital data, or break the A/D
converter itself.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a solid state imager device which is capable of
detecting a dark level without adversely affecting an A/D
converter.According to the present invention, the above object can
be achieved by a solid state imager device comprising:
a solid state imaging section including:
a sensor having a plurality of pixels, said sensor
comprising at least a linear array of photoelectric
transducers representing said pixels, respectively, and a
light-shielded black region in which pixels are shielded from
light; a charge transfer section for transferring signal
charges read from said sensor, said charge transfer section
having a transfer region for transferring the signal charges
and a through region for passing the signal charges
therethrough; anda charge detector for detecting signal charges
transferred by said charge transfer section, converting the
detected signal charges into electric signals, and outputting
the electric signals as output signals, said through region
being disposed between the transfer region and the charge
detector;a clamping circuit for clamping the output signals from
said solid state imaging section;a timing generator for generating a readout gate pulse
for reading signal charges from said sensor, a transfer clock
signal for energizing said charge transfer section, and
clamping pulses for being supplied to said clamping circuit,
said clamping pulses including a clamping pulse associated to
said light-shielded
