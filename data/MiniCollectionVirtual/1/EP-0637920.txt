<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for treating an object (1) with a stream of hot air (2) generated by a hand-held appliance (3) and directed towards the object (1). The hand-held appliance (3) has a fan (4) and a heater (5). When the appliance (3) is switched on, a predetermined heating power of the heater (5) is automatically switched off or reduced when the stream of hot air (2) flows past the object (1) and is automatically set again when the stream of hot air (2) hits the object (1). Alternatively, when the appliance (3) is switched on, the predetermined heating power of the heater (5) is automatically switched off or reduced when a predetermined distance (S) between the object (1) and appliance (3) is exceeded and the predetermined heating power of the heater (5) is automatically set again when the predetermined distance (S) is reached or falls below a threshold value. A hand-held appliance is also disclosed for carrying out said process.

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating an object (1) with a stream of hot air (2)
directed at the object (1) by means of a hand-held appliance (3)

provided with a fan (4) and a heater (5), wherein a predetermined
heat output of the heater (5) is automatically switched off or

automatically reduced by the appliance (3) when the hot-air
stream (2) flows past the object (1) or a predetermined distance

(S) between the object (1) and the appliance (3) is exceeded,
and wherein the predetermined heat output of the heater (5) is

automatically switched on again when the hot-air stream (2)
strikes the object (1) or the distance from the object is less than or

equal to the predetermined distance (S), characterised in that the
fan (4) remains switched on if the appliance (3) is switched on

manually.
A hand-held appliance (3) provided with a fan (4) and a heater
(5) for treating an object (1) with a stream of hot air (2) directed at

the object (1), wherein the appliance (3) is provided with a means
for automatically switching off or automatically reducing a

predetermined heat output of the heater (5) when the hot-air
stream (2) flows past the object (1) or a predetermined distance

(S) between the object (1) and the appliance (3) is exceeded,
and wherein the means is provided for automatically switching on

the heater (5) or automatically switching over to the 
predetermined heat output when the hot-air stream (2) strikes the

object (1) or the distance from the object is less than or equal to
the predetermined distance (S), characterised in that the fan (4) is

switched on if the appliance (3) is switched on manually.
A hand-held appliance according to claim 2, characterised in
that the first means is provided with a sensor (8, 10, 23, 29, 32) for

detecting a hot-air stream (2) flowing past the object (1).
A hand-held appliance according to claim 3, characterised in
that the sensor is formed as a reflected-light receiver (10) in

combination with a scanning-light transmitter (9) transmitting
substantially in the direction of the hot-air stream.
A hand-held appliance according to claim 3, characterised in
that the sensor is formed as an ultrasonic reflex receiver (8) in

combination with an ultrasonic transmitter (7).
A hand-held appliance according to claim 5, characterised in
that the sensor is provided alternately as an ultrasonic reflex

transmitter (7) and an ultrasonic receiver (8).
A hand-held appliance according to claim 2, characterised in
that the second means is provided with a sensor for detecting a

deviation from the predetermined distance (S) between the
object (1) and the appliance (3).
A hand-held appliance according to claim 7, characterised in
that an ultrasonic transmitter (7) and an ultrasonic receiver (8) 

provided with the sensor are provided for detecting the distance
(S) between the object (1) and the appliance (3).
A hand-held appliance according to claim 8, characterised in
that the ultrasonic transmitter (7) is provided alternately as an

ultrasonic receiver (8).
A hand-held appliance according to at least one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the ultrasonic transmitter

(7)/ ultrasonic receiver (8) system is provided both for detecting a
hot-air stream (2) flowing past the object (1) and for detecting a

deviation from the predetermined distance (S) between the
object (1) and the appliance (3).
A hand-held appliance according to claim 7, characterised in
that an air-pressure sensor (32) is provided.
A hand-held appliance according to claim 3 and/or claim 7,
characterised in that the sensor is arranged in a handle (23) of the

appliance (3).
A hand-held appliance according to claim 3 and/or claim 7,
characterised in that the sensor is arranged on a contoured nozzle

(24).
A hand-held appliance according to claim 3 and/or claim 7,
characterised in that the sensor is arranged inside the appliance

(3). 
A hand-held appliance according to at least claim 2,
characterised in that the first and/or second means is provided

with a delay device (18) for switching off or reducing the heat
output.
A hand-held appliance according to claim 15, characterised in
that 0.5 to 4 s are provided as a delay time.
A method according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the heat output is controlled (45) in such a

manner that the temperature of the hot-air stream (2) directed at
the object (1) is constant, irrespective of the distance a.
A method according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the heat output is controlled (46, 47) in such

a manner that the temperature of the hot-air stream (2) is reduced
or eliminated altogether in proportion to an increasing distance a.
