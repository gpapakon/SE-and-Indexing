<ABSTRACT>
A split abrasive roll is provided, including cooperative engaging members (3) disposed on both the rotatable shaft (2) of an abrasive machine and the inner surface of the roll member. The cooperative engaging members affix the center portion of the split abrasive roll to the shaft, while preserving a uniform abrasive outer surface. The respective ends (3b) of each of the roll members are also retained, and the split abrasive roll so provided tends to overcome the deficiencies in the split abrasive rolls of the prior art.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a split abrasive roll 
for attachment to a rotatable shaft. In many applications, it is desirable to attach 
an abrasive roll to a rotatable output shaft, so that the 
abrasive roll may be rotated and contacted with a 
workpiece to abrade material from the workpiece. The 
abrasive roll is typically cylindrical, and has a 
cylindrical central bore through which the shaft is 
fitted. The outer surface of the cylindrical roll includes 
an abrasive coating, which may be, for example, a bonded 
or coated abrasive. In some instances, the shaft onto which the 
abrasive roll must be mounted is permanently mounted to a 
machine at each end of the shaft. That is, the abrasive 
roll may not be mounted on the shaft, because each end of 
the shaft is attached to a machine, or is otherwise 
inaccessible. Furthermore, unitary cylindrical abrasive 
rolls may be difficult to remove from a shaft, due to 
friction between the shaft and the roll, contaminants on 
the shaft, and the like. In these situations, a split 
abrasive roll is used instead of a unitary abrasive roll. The split abrasive roll is, in essence, a 
unitary abrasive roll that has been divided along its 
length to provide two or more components that 
cooperatively form a complete abrasive roll. For example, 
Figure 1 illustrates an abrasive roll 1 having opposed, 
semicylindrical abrasive roll members 3 adapted for 
affixation to a cylindrical, rotatable shaft 2. Abrasive 
roll members 3 are typically attached to shaft 2 using 
bolts 4 at each end of the roll members, which bolt passes 
through shaft 2 at two points, as shown in Figure 1.  
 The two roll members each include an abrasive outer surface, 
against which a workpiece may be applied when the shaft and abrasive 
roll are rotated. A construction according to Fig. 1 is 
basically known from Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 
61-7893. From DE-C-394 137 a split abrasive roll for attachment to a 
rotatable shaft is known comprising at least two abrasive roll 
members each having an abrasive outer surface and an inner surface. 
The roll members are adapted to cooperatively form a 
generally cylindrical split abrasive roll. The inner surfaces of 
the at least two abrasive roll members are adapted to form a 
central shaft receiving portion wherein the abrasive roll members 
each have first and second ends. The known split abrasive 
roll further comprises means for affixing the respective first 
and second ends of the roll portions to the shaft, whereby the 
end

A split abrasive roll for attachment to a rotable shaft 
(2), comprising 


at least two abrasive roll members (3) each having an 
abrasive outer surface (3a) and an inner surface, wherein 

the roll members are adapted to cooperatively form a generally 
cylindrical split abrasive roll, and said inner surfaces 

are adapted to form a central shaft receiving portion, 
said abrasive roll members each having first and second 

ends (3b); and 
means for affixing the respective first and second ends 
of the roll portions to the shaft, whereby said end affixing 

means are adapted to affix said roll members to the 
rotatable shaft, 
 
characterized by 


a cooperative enganging member disposed on the inner surface 
of each of said at least two roll members between said 

first and second ends; and 
a cooperative engaging member disposed on the rotatable 
shaft corresponding to each of said cooperative engaging 

members disposed on said roll members; 
whereby said cooperative engaging members are adapted for 
reciprocal interengagement to affix a central portion of 

each of said roll members to the shaft. 
The split abrasive roll of claim 1, wherein the cooperative 
engaging member disposed on the shaft comprises an engaging 

projection (8a), and the cooperative engaging members disposed 
on the inner surfaces of the respective roll members 

comprise a receiving portion (3d).  
 
The split abrasive roll of claim 1, wherein 
the cooperative engaging member disposed on the shaft 

comprises a receiving portion (3d), and the cooperative 
engaging members disposed on the inner surfaces of the 

respective roll members comprise an engaging projection 
(8a). 
The split abrasive roll of claim 1, wherein 
said at least two abrasive roll members comprise two 

semicylindrical roll members (3). 
The split abrasive roll of claim 1, wherein 
said end affixing means comprises a retaining collar (6) 

affixed to the rotatable shaft (2) about the circumference 
of the shaft, said retaining collar including a flange 

portion (6a) adapted to receive and retain said end (3b) 
of each abrasive roll member. 
The split abrasive roll of claim 1, wherein 
the first end (3b) of each roll member is affixed to the 

rotatable shaft (2) with a bolt (11), and the second end 
(3b) of each roll member is affixed to the rotatable shaft 

by a retaining collar (6) having a flange portion (6a) 
adapted to receive and retain said second ends. 
The split abrasive roll of claim 1, wherein 
one of said cooperative engaging members comprises a bolt
