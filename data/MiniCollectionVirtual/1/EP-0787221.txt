<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of improving the
oxidation resistance of a platinum modified aluminide coating
formed on a nickel base superalloy substrate, as well as to a
repaired engine-run component having a platinum modified
aluminide coating.At temperatures greater than about 1000°C (1832°F), high
temperature oxidation is the most important form of
environmental attack observed with aluminide diffusion
coatings. High temperature oxidation is a chemical reaction
whose rate controlling process for an aluminide coating is
the diffusion of aluminum through a product (oxide) layer.
Diffusion is a thermally activated process, and consequently,
the diffusion coefficients are exponential functions of
temperature. Since the oxidation of aluminide coatings is a
diffusion controlled reaction and diffusion coefficients are
exponential functions of temperature, the oxidation rate is
also an exponential function of temperature. At low
temperatures where diffusion coefficients are relatively
small, the growth rate of a protective scale on any aluminide
coating is also small. Thus, adequate oxidation resistance
should be provided by any state of the art aluminide
coatings, such as: chromium aluminide, aluminide or two phase
[PtAl2 + (Ni,Pt)Al] platinum aluminide, all inward grown
coatings 
made by pack cementation. However, at high temperatures
where the diffusion coefficients and consequently the
oxidation rate increase rapidly with increasing
temperature, only coatings which form high purity alumina
(Al2O3) scales are likely to provide adequate resistance to
environmental degradation. This point is clearly
illustrated by the cyclic oxidation test results from
three state of the art aluminide coatings (designated MDC-51,
MDC-351 and LDC-2E by the Assignee, Howmet
Corporation) on IN-100 substrates provided in Figure 1.
The observed variations in life of coatings with the same
initial thickness is the result of differences in the
growth rate and/or adherence of the protective oxide
scale. Specifically, the dissolution of substitutional
substrate alloying elements into the aluminide coating and
consequently the alumina scale can result in doping
effects which can produce significant increases in the
growth rate of the oxide scale. In addition, the presence
of surface active tramp substrate impurities (S, P etc.)
in the aluminide coating can have a detrimental effect on
the adherence of the protective oxide scale. Thus, the
inward grown chromium modified and simple aluminides
(which contain all the

least about 1000°C, introducing a coating gas comprising
hydrogen and aluminum trichloride into the coating

retort to contact the heated substrate, and forming an
