<ABSTRACT>
An auto-centrifuge analyser (10) combines a centrifuge (11) with a haemoglobin photometer and sophisticated means for analysing predetermined characteristics of samples supported in the centrifuge or photometer to enable the production of diagnostic and treatment information based on the sample being tested in a relatively short period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
"Apparatus For Analysing Blood And Other Samples"This invention relates primarily to an auto-centrifuge analyser and associated diagnostic equipment such as for use by veterinary and medical practitioners . The invention is particularly useful for use in surgeries, offices, clinics, hospitals and so on, and largely adapted to perform haematology analysis. However, the invention also finds application in the analysis of other samples, including urine, river water and so on.Information relating to the haematological status of a patient during examination is extremely valuable to a practitioner, as it may be incorporated immediately with other observations into the establishment of a diagnosis. However, in the past this has rarely been possible as samples of blood are usually sent to remote laboratories with results taking up to a week or the like to be obtained. Further disadvantages and complications arise through the damage of the blood during transport and the morphology of cells may change rendering identification difficult or impossible.It is recognised that significant advantage could be 

gained if a practitioner could obtain important diagnostic information while the patient is in the surgery during the period of consultation. This would enable the practitioner to initiate therapy or order further, more detailed investigations based on the immediate results obtained.The total number of white blood cells and the relative proportions of three different types of the cells, namely lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophiles is valuable to a clinician in the formation of a differential diagnoses in respect of many pathological conditions, especially inflammatory, infective and neoplastic diseases.A further particulate component of the blood which is of interest to the practitioner is the platelet. These are not cells but are cytoplasmic fragments formed from a specific cell type. Platelets play an important role in blood clotting.It is appreciated that the aforementioned cells and components of blood are not exhaustive of all of which blood is comprised. However, it is considered that the aforementioned are of great importance to the practitioner in the preliminary investigation of a patient.Existing procedures for counting and identifying cells in blood include manual procedures, the use of small electronic cell counters and differential centrifugation analysers. In the manual procedure, dilutions of blood are prepared in isotonic solutions, stained and subsequently placed on a haemocytometer. The red

CLAIMS
1 Apparatus for analysing samples, comprising sample carrying means, centrifuge for rotating a said sample at a predetermined rotational velocity such that centrifugal force separates the various phases or components of the sample, sample reading means for reading or measuring predetermined characteristics of the sample, analysis means for analysing the data obtained by the sample reading means and display means for displaying data produced by the analysis means relating to the sample.
2 Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the sample carrying means includes a centrifugal head having slots for supporting respective tubes.
3 Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the sample carrying means also includes a cuvette receptor.
4 Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the sample carrying means also includes a sample tube rotor.
5 Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 4 wherein the tubes may be either blood centrifuge tubes or haematocrit tubes, wherein said blood centrifuge tubes are also adapted for containing urine.
6 Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the centrifuge includes a DC servomotor and a drive shaft upon which the centrifugal head and sample tube rotor are adapted 


 to be mounted.
7 Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the sample reading means includes a haemoglobin photometer for reading predetermined characteristics relating to the sample contained in a cuvette positioned in the cuvette receptor, and a polychromatic optical head positioned on a scanning arm enabling radial readings of predetermined characteristics of the sample contained in a tube supported on the centrifugal head.
8 Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, wherein the polychromatic optical head includes means for measuring the length of a sample within a tube and an interface detector and a multi-wavelength spectrophotometer.
9 Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7 or Claim 8 wherein the scanning arm is pivotably mounted at a position adjacent to the circumference of the centrifugal head such that one end of the arm supporting the polychromatic optical head may move from a first position outside of the circumference to a second position within the circumference defined by the centrifugal head.
10 Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7 or Claim 8, wherein the scanning arm is mounted on a linear track facilitating radial movement of the polychromatic optical head.
11 Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, wherein the display means comprises a 


 visual display, such as an LCD screen or a printed output .
12 Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims also including data input means.
13 Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, wherein the analysis means includes a memory containing diagnostic data interpretation assistance, data comprising analytic reference ranges relevant to the sample being analysed and data comprising recommendations for further testing based on the associated analysis of the sample.
14 Apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 2-13, wherein the tubes are detachable from the cuvette receptor, rotor and centrifugal head and are disposable.
15 Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, which is adapted to be connected to or integral with a pattern recognition means for detecting and recording the size and morphological characteristics of a large number of cells.
