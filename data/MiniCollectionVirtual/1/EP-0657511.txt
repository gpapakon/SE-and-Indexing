<ABSTRACT>
Granulated pigment for the colouring of building materials, comprising inorganic pigments, especially iron oxide pigments, and a disaccharide, preferably lactose, as binder. The pigment granules are produced by preparing a homogenised aqueous pigment suspension containing the disaccharide in solution, spraying this suspension in countercurrent to a drying gaseous medium, and catching the resulting granules in collecting devices.
