<ABSTRACT>
The metal cored hose (7) has inner- and outer plastic lining and is pushed onto the profiled stub of the metal connector (5) where it locates axially against a radial lip (5a). The coupling is secured by crimping an outer sleeve (3) over the end of the hose. The sleeve has a plastic lip (1) to form an axial buffer between the hose and the radial lip. The profiled stub includes a raised section (6) incorporating a sealing ring. After crimping the sleeve over the raised section the coupling has good axial strength.

A sealing connection of plastic-metal-plastic 
composite tubes (7) comprising a cylindrical 

connecting part (5) made of metal, especially 
deplating-resistant brass or red bronze, by means of 

which the composite tube (7) slipped thereupon is 
connectable by deformation under compression 

pressure, said connecting part (5) having a circumferential, 
axial stopper (5a) for the frontal part 

(7d) of the composite tube (7), an essentially 
cylindrical press sleeve (3) being provided which, 

in the section of one of its frontal parts, is 
provided with a plastic part (1) which extends 

inwards radially, said press sleeve (3) comprising 
the plastic part (1) being orientated in such a way 

in relation to the circumferential axial stopper 
(5a) of the connecting part (5) in the direction of 

the composite tube (7) that direct contact of the 
frontal part (7d) of the composite tube (7) with the 

stopper (5a) may be prevented, and the press sleeve 
(3) may be pressed together with the composite tube 

(7) on the connecting part (5) with the purpose of 
creating a fixed and distortion-proof connection 

between the connecting part (5) and the composite 
tube (7), comprising the following features: 


a) the plastic part (1) is maintained in a form-fit 
and/or frictional and/or material-closing manner 

at the cylindrical section of the press-sleeve,  
 
b) the press sleeve (3) may be slipped on, 
c) in case of a frictional connection said 
frictional connection between the plastic part 

(1) and the press sleeve (3) is achieved by a 
press fit of a cylindrical part of the plastic 

part at the outer or inner perimeter of the press 
sleeve (3), 
d) the frontal part (1b) of the plastic part (1) 
extends radially so far inwards when the press 

sleeve (3) is slipped on the connecting part (5) 
and the composite tube (7) that it is capable of 

keeping the press sleeve (3) on the cylindrical 
connecting part (5) in a non-pressed state. 
A connection according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the form-fit between the plastic part (1) and 

the press sleeve (3) is achieved by a collar (1a) on 
the cylindrical part and a groove on the press 

sleeve (3). 
A connection according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the collar (1a) and the groove (3a) are 

executed in a circumferential manner. 
A connection according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the material closure between the plastic part 

(1) and the press sleeve (3) is achieved by an 
adhesive connection. 
A connection according to any of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the press sleeve consists of 

brass.  
 
A connection according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that the plastic part (1) is made 
of an elastomer material or of a two-layer composition 

comprising an elastomer material. 
A connecting part and press sleeve-plastic part 
composite for the connection according to any of the 

claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the composite 
with the plastic part (1) in a non-pressed state is 

slipped on at the retarded end of the press sleeve 
(3) while sitting on the connecting part 5 and the 

composite is fixed in a form-fit and/or frictional 
connection manner by the plastic part (1) as a 

transport safeguard on the connecting part (5). 
A connecting part and press sleeve-plastic part 
composite according to claim 7, characterised in 

that the plastic part (1) is provided with a 
pellicle at its frontal part (1b). 
A connecting part and press sleeve-plastic part 
composite according to claim 8, characterised in 

that the pellicle has an at least approximately 
circular perforation line.
