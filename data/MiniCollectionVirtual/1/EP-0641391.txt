<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of introducing a 3'-terminal loop structure onto a target sequence of one strand of double stranded DNA, said target sequence having a region A at the 3'-terminus thereof and there being optionally a DNA region B which extends 3' from region A, whereby said double-stranded DNA is subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using a first primer hybridising to the 3'-terminus of the sequence complementary to the target sequence, which first primer is immobilised or provided with means for attachement to a solid support, and a second primer having a 3'-terminal sequence which hybridises to at least a portion of A and/or B of the target sequence while having at its 5'-end a sequence substantially identical to A, said amplification producing double-stranded target DNA having at the 3'-end of the target sequence, in the following order, the region A, a region capable of forming a loop and a sequence A' complementary to sequence A, whereafter the amplified double-stranded DNA is subjected in immobilised form to strand separation whereby the non-immobilised target strand is liberated and region A' is permitted or caused to hybridise to region A, thereby forming said loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Loop Structures5 This invention relates to loop structures at the 3'-terminal of a single strand of DNA.It is known in molecular biology that single stranded nucleic acids are known to fold back on themselves and form loop structures and short double10 stranded segments held together by hydrogen bonding. Such secondary structures can affect the susceptibility of the nucleic acid to interaction with enzymes, e.g. polymeraseε, hydrolases and such like. In some instances the formation of loop structures by15. single stranded nucleic acid will compete with the hybridisation of a probe or a primer to a target sequence of the nucleic acid. In the case where a primer is being used, e.g. for sequencing DNA, the formation of loops at or near the sequence at which the20 primer hybridises will lower the efficiency of hybridisation and thereby effect the clarity of sequencing results.The present invention is based on the concept of using PCR to introduce loop structures which provide a25 primer at the 3'-terminal of a DNA strand of interest.DNA molecules are often present in samples in small quantities and in order to amplify such DNA, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method has been developed. In this technique a pair of polymerisation30 primers specific to known sequences of the target DNA are selected, one hybridising at or near the 5' end of one of the strands and the other at or near the 5' end of the complementary strand such that in the presence of a polymerase, each primer produces a DNA sequence35 extending the full length of the target DNA template. If the DNA so produced is then subjected to strand separation, typically by melting at a temperature of 

about 90°C, the newly formed single stranded DNA sequences will hybridise to excess primer present in the mixture, usually after reducing the temperature to the range suitable for annealing, whereupon in the presence of the polymerase, further DNA strands are synthesised, this time extending only between the termini of the two primers. The polymerase is preferably capable of surviving the high temperature used in the strand separation step, a suitable thermophilic polymerase, namely Taq, having recently become available. If an excess of the two primers and of nucleotides needed for DNA synthesis is maintained in the medium, it is possible to operate a repeated cyclic process in which the separate strands are synthesised, separated, annealed to primer and new strands synthesised, merely by raising and lowering the temperature between the optimal

Claims
1. A method of introducing a 3 '-terminal loop structure onto a target sequence of one strand of double stranded DNA, said target sequence having a region A at the 3'- terminus thereof and there being optionally a DNA region B which extends 3' from region A, whereby said double- stranded DNA is subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using a first primer hybridising to the 3 '-terminus of the sequence complementary to the target sequence, which first primer is immobilised or provided with means for attachment to a solid support, and a second primer having a 3 ' -terminal sequence which hybridises to at least a portion of A and/or B of the target sequence while having at its 5'-end a sequence substantially identical to A, said amplification producing double-stranded target DNA having at the 3 '-end of the target sequence, in the following order, the region A, a region capable of forming a loop and a sequence A' complementary to sequence A, whereafter the amplified double-stranded DNA is subjected in immobilised form to strand separation whereby the non- immobilised target strand is liberated and region A

 is permitted or caused to hybridise to region A, thereby forming said loop.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 in which after final strand separation of the amplified double stranded DNA, the region A' on the immobilised single stranded DNA strand is caused to hybridise to the region A by annealing at a temperature above the self-annealing temperature of the second primer.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which the immobilised single stranded DNA after loop formation contains a restriction site in the double stranded region adjacent to the loop.
4. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the first primer carries biotin as means for 


immobilisation.
5. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the first primer carries a recognition site for a DNA binding protein carrying a label.
6. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the immobilised single stranded DNA after loop formation is subjected to sequencing using the 3'-end of the A
r
 sequence as the primer for sequencing.
7. A method as claimed in claim 6 in which the region A' is chosen to hybridise immediately adjacent to a single target base to be determined in the target sequence and the immobilised single stranded DNA is subjected to a chain extension reaction in the presence of a specific deoxynucleoside or dideoxynucleoside whereby chain extension or absence of chain extension provides an indication of the presence or absence of said target base.
