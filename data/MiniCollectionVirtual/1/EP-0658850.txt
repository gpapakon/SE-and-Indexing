<ABSTRACT>
The host adaptor package 4 and the disk adaptor
package 6 which constitute the magnetic disk subsystem

1 are connected to the common bus 3 consisting of a
data bus, a control bus, and a power line in the hot

replacement ready state. The packages 4 and 6 have
the control medium 11 and the clock generator 14 and

when a failure occurs in a package, the replace
controller 13 mounted in the control medium 11

executes the closing processing for the bus driver 15
and the clock generator 14. If this occurs, the clock

generator 14 enters the closed state, so that the
circuit in the package enters the reset state and the

package function is stopped, that is, the package
enters the closed state. As a result, hot replacement

of the closed package can be executed without
affecting the operation of the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a storage system
which can be maintained unless power is turned off
when an information processing unit is maintained and
more particularly to a magnetic disk subsystem in
which each package can be hotreplaced for the common
bus.In a computer system which is used for plant
control or a financial system at present, non-stop
operation thereof is required. However, in a
conventional computer system, when an error occurs in
a part of the system, it is necessary to turn the
power of system off once so as to execute a recovery
operation. To run the system nonstop, it is necessary
to replace or maintain the part where an error occurs
without the power of system being turned off.There is an application regarding the hot
replacement art for realizing such nonstop
maintenance. In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No. Heisei 5-175678, an art that in an electronic
device having a plurality of packages connected to a
common bus, a controller installed outside the
packages controls a bus buffer which is a connection 
circuit of the packages and common bus at the time of
replacement of the packages and separates the packages
logically from the common bus is indicated.
Concretely, the art makes the impedance of the
connection part of the bus buffer and common bus high.To run a computer system nonstop, it is effective
to use an art for enhancing the reliability of the
whole system, that is, to use a fault tolerance system
which consists of a plurality of redundant systems.
As this type of a prior art, a system consisting of a
plurality of redundant systems in which the parts
other than the interfaces of the redundant systems are
operated by independent clocks for each redundant
system is indicated in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open No. Heisei 3-266011.The electronic device indicated in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 5-175675 controls hot
replacement and diagnosis of a plurality of packages
intensively by a specific controller in the device.
As a result, when a failure occurs in the controller,
the system cannot be maintained nonstop. Only an art
for separating the bus buffer logically from the
common bus, that is, an art for separating the
packages from a data system bus for transmitting data 
is indicated. Therefore, the effect on the whole
system is not taken into account.In Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
Heisei 3-266011, a system which allows an operation by
an independent clock for each redundant system is
indicated. However, replacement of each

<CLAIMS>
A storage system, comprising:

(a) at least one first package (4) connected to a host, for constituting an
interface to said host;
(b) at least one storage device (7) for storing data;
(c) at least one second package (6) connected to said storage device,
for constituting an interface to said storage device;
(d) at least one cache memory package (5) for temporarily storing data
transmitted between said first package connected to said host and

said second package connected to said storage device; and
(e) a common bus (3) for connecting said first packages, said second
packages and said cache memory packages, to one another, each of

said packages being detachably mounted to said common bus,

   wherein
each of said first and second packages has a clock circuit (14) for supplying

a clock to an inner circuit in each of said first and second packages,
and a control medium (11),
characterized in that

each of said control media detects a failure which occurs in said package
itself and executes a closing processing for said package by stopping supply

of said clock to said inner circuit.
A storage system according to claim 1, wherein each of said control media
(11) detects a failure of the other package and executes the closing processing

for said other package. 
A storage system according to claim 1, whereby said system has a maintenance
medium (19) for monitoring the operation status of said package and

maintaining a package in which a failure occurs.
A storage system according to claim 3, wherein said maintenance medium
(19) allows said control medium (11) to execute the closing processing.
