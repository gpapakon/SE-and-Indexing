<ABSTRACT>
The machine is provided to wrap with a film portion 
a tray containing food products, the trays being inserted 

through a side device (13) having weighing scales which 
trays can moreover be labelled. The film insertion and 

cutting means comprise a carrier (3) joined to a cam (9) 
which on turning causes the said carrier to move forwards 

and backwards, whereas the cutting device has a blade 
(12) mounted upon a support, which is also driven by the 

cam (9) in such a way that the carrier and blade 
movements are synchronised. The machine includes a 

weighing station located under the carrier, and an 
electric station with all the power and control means of 

the machine as such, moreover incorporating tray lifting 
means that allow the lift to be used to handle variously 

sized trays, automatically and without having to change 
parts or elements. The machine also has a film insertion 

system that allows the film roll to be used to be changed 
fully automatically, the system comprising a frame driven 

by an eccentric, the former moving vertically in 
functional combination with a pair of film insertion 

carriers, by coupling to a drive carrier that is 
transversely displaceable by tightening means associated 

to the actual film cutting synchrony cam, the film 
insertion carrier to be used being selected by means of 

a number of locking and drive bolts that involve each of 
the carriers depending upon their relative positions to 

the drive carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a stretchable film tray 
wrapping machine and in particular to a number of 
improvements to machines designed to wrap trays holding 
food products with a stretchable film, the subject 
machine being designed to optionally carry a weighing 
station and even a labelling station. One of the improvements the machine includes is the 
provision of film insertion means and synchronism thereof 
with the cutting means, the above in order for the film 
replacement operation to be much easier. Another improvement lies in the tray feeding means 
which have been designed to be optionally fitted with a 
weighing station or scales, organising feeding and 
weighing so that whilst a tray is being weighed another 
tray can already be disposed at the feeder load area. Another improvement of the machine subject hereof is 
found in the electric station fitted with the cards and 
all components for controlling the machine, which station 
has been organised to be easily removable and replaceable 
if it breaks down. Another feature lies in that after 
loosening the screws holding it against the body of the 
machine, it will lie in a stable angled position that 
will make visual check and manipulation easier. Another improvement of the machine lies in tray 
lifting means that allow the lifting means to be used to  
 
handle variously sized trays automatically and without 
having to change any parts or elements, covering almost 
all the usual marketable sizes. Another improvement lies in that the machine is 
alternatively provided with mechanical insertion means 
which will, depending upon the size of the product to be 
wrapped, automatically change the film roll to be used. Utility model ES-U-1017827 of the same applicant claims 
a device for holding the film sideways in wrapping 
machines, which holding device relies upon a pair of 
clamps with which the film is held, which clamps are 
mounted upon supports travelling along tracks that allow 
the distance between the same to be varied, thereby 
adjusting perfectly to the type of roll to be used in 
each case, which adjustment is made fully automatically 
because of the mobility of the supports to which the film 
clamps are attached, and of the means working with such 
supports, such as racks, driving gears and so forth. For its part, patent of invention ES-A-2065.829, likewise 
of the same applicant, claims improvements precisely to 
film wrapping machines, applicable in means designed to 
control the reciprocating travel of a rod which limits 
the
