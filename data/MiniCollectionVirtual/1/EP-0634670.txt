<ABSTRACT>
Storage phosphor imaging system includes a 
source of stimulating light (56), a scanner (72),(34) 

for scanning a storage phosphor (24) with a latent x-ray 
image with said stimulating light in a raster 

pattern to produce an emitted light x-ray image and a 
photodetector (82) for converting the emitted light x-ray 

image into an x-ray image signal. The storage 
phosphor (24) has associated with it a first bar code 

pattern (120) of alternating bars and spaces for 
identifying the storage phosphor and a second bar code 

pattern (122) of contiguous reflective/nonreflective 
cells for identifying storage phosphor exposure speed 

and storage phosphor size parameters. A first scanning 
bar code reader (110) and a second bar code reader 

(112) including a number of contiguous light emitter 
(132) and photodetector (134) assemblies, read the 

first and second bar code patterns, respectively, to 
produce signals used in identifying, reading and 

processing the storage phosphor and image signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to storage
phosphor systems in which a latent x-ray image is
recorded in a storage phosphor. A storage phosphor
reader converts the stored latent x-ray image into an
x-ray image signal. After conversion, the storage
phosphor is erased and reused. This invention relates
more particularly to a storage phosphor reader having
storage phosphor size and exposure speed detection.In a storage phosphor imaging system as
described in US-A-Re. 31,847, a storage phosphor is
exposed to an x-ray image of an object, such as the
body part of a patient, to record a latent x-ray image
in the storage phosphor. The latent x-ray image is
read out by stimulating the storage phosphor with
relatively long wavelength stimulating radiation such
as red or infrared light produced by a helium neon gas
laser or diode laser. Upon stimulation, the storage
phosphor releases emitted radiation of an intermediate
wavelength, such as blue light, in proportion to the
quantity of x-rays that were received. To produce a
signal useful in electronic image processing the
storage phosphor is scanned in a raster pattern by a
laser beam deflected by an oscillating or rotating
scanning mirror or hologon. The emitted radiation from
the storage phosphor is reflected by a mirror light
collector and detected by a photodetector, such as a
photomultiplier, to produce an electronic image signal.
Typically the storage phosphor is translated in a page
scan direction past the laser beam which is repeatedly
deflected in a line scan direction perpendicular to the
page scan motion of the storage phosphor to form a
scanning raster pattern of a matrix of pixels.Typically, storage phosphors of different
sizes and different x-ray exposure speeds are used in a 
diagnostic x-ray facility. Thus, different storage
phosphor sizes are used in the x-ray exposure of
different body parts, for example, a larger size storage
phosphor is needed for a chest x-ray than for a breast x-ray.
Similarly, storage phosphors of different x-ray
exposure speeds are used, for different diagnostic
applications. Where different size storage phosphors are
scanned, the scanning raster pattern size and scanning
beam size may change. Such changes result in changing
levels of emitted light which must be compensated either
in reading the storage phosphor and/or in processing the
read x-ray image signal. If the storage phosphor size and
speed are encoded in a scanning type bar code associated
with the storage phosphor, scanning such a bar code while
the storage
