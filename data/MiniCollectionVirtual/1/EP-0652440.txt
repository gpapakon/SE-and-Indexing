<ABSTRACT>
An acceleration sensor is shown having a substrate (16, 16', 
16'', 16''') on which a capacitor detect plate (24) and source plate 

mounting portion (28
c
) are disposed. An electrically conductive 
blade member (40, 44) having an attachment portion (40
a
, 44
h
), a 
source plate portion (40
i
, 44
a
) and integrally attached beams 
(40
b
, 40
c
; 44
b
) extending along opposite sides of the blade 
member is mounted on 
the substrate by welding the attachment 
portion to a mounting element (36, 36', 36'', 36''') which is 

closely received in a bore (32, 32', 32'', 32''') formed through the 
substrate at the source plate mounting portion. The mounting 

element or the bore is formed with a surface suitable for forming 
an interference fit and for making electrical engagement with a 

conductive layer received in the bore. The mounting element has 
one end (36
b
, 36
b
', 36
b
'') which extends above the top surface 
(26, 26'') an adjustable selected amount(s) to provide desired 

spacing between the source plate portion and the detect plate. A 
single mounting element of a pair of mounting elements can be 

used and may be in the form of a solid (36, 36'', 36''') or a hollow 
(36') pin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to condition sensors
and more particularly to accelerometers having mechanically
movable means responsive to acceleration for providing a
corresponding electrical signal.Condition sensors such as capacitive accelerometers and
the like of various types as shown in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,483,194 to Rudolph; 4,435,737 to Colton; Reissue 31,549
to Block and 3,240,073 to Pitzer are commonly used or
proposed for use in aircraft and vehicular applications and
the like where the sensors are likely to be subjected to
shock, vibration and severe temperature changes but where it
would be desirable for the sensors to be inexpensive and to
display reliable and accurate performance characteristics
over a long service life. However, many such sensors have
limited performance capability or are manufactured at
excessive cost. It would be desirable if such sensors could
be provided with improved reliability in performance and
could be made at reduced cost to find wider application.EP 0 491 506 discloses several capacitive accelerometer
devices, in which a plate is mounted on but spaced from a
substrate. The plate comprises an attachment portion which
is attached to the substrate, a source plate portion, the
distance of which from the substrate varies in response to
acceleration, and a beam portion connecting the attachment
and source plate portions. A detect plate is disposed on
the surface of the substrate opposite the source plate
portion and the capacitance between those two is measured to
determine the acceleration of the device. In one example
the spacing between the plate and the substrate is set by a 
flat spacer or shim disposed between the plate and the
substrate and the plate, spacer and substrate are held
together with adhesive. In a second example the plate,
spacer, and substrate are riveted together. In a third
example the attachment plate portion is thicker than the rest
of the plate and so the plate has an integral spacer.The use of a shim adds, however, an additional part and
process step which adds to the cost of the device as well.
Further, when using a shim it is difficult to obtain close
dimensional control from device to device. Use of a metal
plate having a reduced thickness portion results in a more
expensive blade member and one for which it is difficult to
provide a properly balanced and mounted source plate portion.EP 0 542 436 discloses similar accelerometer devices to
those of EP 0 491 506. In one example the attachment
portion of the plate is fixed to the
