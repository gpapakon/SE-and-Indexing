<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical compounds of general formula (I) have been prepared and non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein R1 is a halogen substituent; R2 is a member selected from the group consisting of alkoxy, hydroxy and azido; and X-Y is a member selected from the group consisting of CH(N3)-CH2, CH(F)-CH2 and CH = CH. Halogen denotes an iodo, bromo, chloro and fluoro atom. Alkoxy denotes a straight or branched chain moiety having 1-16 carbon atoms. Compounds of formula (I) can exist as the (5R, 6R), (5S, 6S), (5R, 6S) and (5S, 6R) diastereomers which differ in configuration at positions C-5 and C-6. These compounds exhibit anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity (anti-HIV) and are useful in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrom (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex.

 DIHYDROPYRIMIDINE NUCLEOSIDES WITH ANTIVIRAL PROPERTIESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to pharmaceutical compounds. More particularly, the invention provides new unnatural 5,6-dihydropyrimidine nucleoside derivatives, or non- toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, hav¬ ing useful physiological antiviral effects, particularly anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) properties which are useful in the treatment of acquired immuno- deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex. The invention relates to such compounds and compositions there¬ of, and to processes for making and using them.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONHuman immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse tran- scriptase (HIV-1 RT) plays an important role in the life cycle of the virus and has been a major target for the design of drugs to combat AIDS: One class of HIV-1 RT inhibitors are pyrimidine nucleoside analogs such as 3 ' -azido-3 ' -deoxythymidine (AZT) , 3 ' -fluoro-3 ' - deoxythymidine (FT) and 2 ' , 3 ' -didehydro-2 ' , 3 ' - dideoxythymidine (d4T) . These compounds are converted into their triphosphates by cellular enzymes, the triphosphates are then recognized by HIV-1 RT as substrates. The corres¬ ponding nucleoside monophosphate moiety is incorporated into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) chains. Since these analogs lack a 3'-hydroxyl group, this incorporation leads to DNA chain termination. Although AZT appears to be temporarily effective in decreasing mortality and morbidity in some patients with AIDS, or AIDS-related complex, bone marrow toxicity and anemia are very severe [see the Medical 

Letter, 28 , 107 (1986)]. Frequently administered high doses of AZT must be used to maintain a therapeutic drug level due to its short biological half-life of one hour [see D.D. Richman, M.A. Fischl, M.H. Grieco, M.S. Gottlieb, P.A. Volberding, O.L. Laskin, J.M. Leedom, J. Groopman, D. Mildvan, M.S. Hirsch, G.G. Jackson, D.T. Durack and S. Nusinoff-Lehrman, N. Engl. J. Med. , 317, 192 (1987)] which is attributed to its rapid metabolism to the inactive 5'-O-glucuronide (GAZT) and the highly toxic 3'- amino-3'-deoxythymidine (AMT) [see E.M. Cretton, M.-Y. Xie, R.J. Bevan, N.M. Goudgoan, R.F. Schinazi and J.-P. Sommadossi, Mol. Pharmacol., 39 , 258 (1991)]. Since AZT does not penetrate into brain tissue from the cerebral spinal fluid, it does not effectively suppress viral replication in the brain and it is believed that the HIV replicates more rapidly in the central nervous system (CNS) , the CNS serving as a reservoir
