<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel hydrazide 
derivatives of certain 3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyrans, 
to the intermediates, processes and techniques for 
their preparation, to their ability to manifest the 
property of being free radical scavengers, and to their 
end-use application in the treatment of disease conditions 
capable of being ameliorated by free radical scavengers. More specifically this invention relates to compounds of 
the formula 
 
the stereoisomers and mixtures thereof, their inner salts, 
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein 
R is H or C1-6 alkyl, R1 is C1-6 alkyl, R2 is H or -C(O)R, R3 and R4 are independently C1-6 alkyl,  
 R5 is C1-6 alkyl, or 
 
with R8 being H or halogeno, n is zero, 1, 2, or 3 and X is a halide, -S(O)3R6, or nothing when the inner salt 
is formed R6 is H, C1-6 alkyl, phenyl or 4-methylphenyl. As used herein the term "alkyl" includes the straight or 
branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl moieties having 
the designated number of carbon atoms, preferably methyl or 
ethyl, but including propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, 
hexyl and the like. The term -C(O)R includes those acyl 
moieties wherein R includes H and C1-6 alkyl, embracing 
formyl and methylcarbonyl as preferred species but including 
ethylcarbonyl and the like. In the acyl hydrazinium 
moiety (i.e., -C(O)NHN⊕(R3)(R4)(R5).X⊖) the R3, R4 and R5 
preferably are the same alkyl with methyl and ethyl being 
preferred and when R5 is not alkyl the preferred radicals 
are benzyl or R8-substituted benzyl moieties with R8 
preferably being chloro or bromo. The X⊖ moiety includes a 
halogen, preferably chloro or bromo, or a -S(O)3R6 moiety 
wherein R6 is H, C1-6 alkyl, phenyl, or, preferably, 
4-methylphenyl. The inner salts include those compounds wherein the 
acyl hydrazinium moiety would have the structure configuration 
 
as its terminal moiety.  
 The compounds of the present invention include stereoisomers; 
the term "stereoisomer" is a general term for all 
isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the 
orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror 
image isomers (enantiomers), geometric isomers (cis/trans), 
and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center 
that are not mirror images of one another (diastereoisomers). In general, the compounds of this invention may be 
prepared by standard chemical processes and techniques 
analogously known in the art from materials which are 
either known per se or which may be prepared in an 
analogous manner. Preferably
