<DESCRIPTION>
 AMYLIN ANTAGONISTS AND AGONISTSBackground of the Invention This invention relates to specific amylin analogs which behave as amylin antagonists and agonists, and to their use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, and hypercalcemia, and the control of food intake.Amylin, also known as diabetes associated polypeptide (Cooper et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. :7763-7766 (1988)) or islet/insulinoma amyloid polypeptide (Westermark et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 84.:3881-3885 (1987)), is a 37-residue polypeptide amide isolated originally from the amyloid-rich pancreas of insulinoma and noninsulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD) patients. It has subsequently been isolated from the normal pancreas of rat (Asai et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. r 164:400-405 (1989)). CDNA cloning (Ferrier et al., J. Mol. Endocrinol.. 3_:R1-R4 (1989)) and immunocytochemical (Lukinius et al., Diabetologia. 3^:240-244 (1989)) studies have demonstrated that amylin is synthesized in the islet cells and stored in the islet secretory granules along with insulin. It is cosecreted with insulin (Kanatsuka et al., FEBS Lett.. 259:199-201 (1989)). Low quantities of amylin have also been detected in the stomach, intestine, lung and dorsal root ganglion (Asai et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. f 169:788-795 (1990)); and Ferrier et al., supra).Biological investigations that followed the isolation of amylin have shown that amylin inhibits basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake as well as glycogen synthesis by soleus muscles (Leighton et al., Nature. 335:632-635 (1988)). This peripheral insulin resistance by amylin has also been demonstrated in vivo by euglycemic glucose clamp studies with dogs (Sowa et al., 

Diabetoloqia. 3_3:118-120 (1990)) and rats (Molina et al., Diabetes. 3_ :260-265 (1990)). Furthermore, these investigations in rats showed that amylin attenuated the inhibition of hepatic glucose output by insulin (Molina et al., supra) . Based on these observations and the finding that amylin inhibits basal insulin secretion (Ohsawa et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 160:961- 967 (1989)), it has been suggested that amylin might play a role in glucose metabolism and the pathophysiology of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) , commonly known as Type II diabetes mellitus.Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemica, i.e., elevated blood sugar levels. This disease affects a significant percentage of the population. There are two major categories of diabetes mellitus,
