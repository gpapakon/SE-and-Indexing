<ABSTRACT>
In a method for producing newspapers, magazines or similar products by loading receiving devices (11) with different printed products which are arranged along a production route (1) formed from a plurality of feed stations (H, V1 to V3) under open-loop or closed-loop control, the printed products supplied selectively to the receiving devices (11) on the production route (1) are moved to a peripheral path (4) of synchronously driven receiving devices (11), and incomplete products are supplemented by products (13) produced later, for example, after passing through the peripheral path (4).

Process for the production of newspapers, magazines and 
like products by loading printed products into reception 

devices succeeding each other along a production line (1) 
formed by a plurality of controlled or regulated feeder 

stations (H,V
1
-V
3
), characterised in that the printed products 
which are selectively supplied to a reception device at the 

production line (1), are passed on to reception devices (11) 
driven in synchronism by a circulation track (4), and 

incomplete products, before they leave the circulation 
track (4), are replaced by like complete products. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
complete products which replace the incomplete products are 

remanufactured during the production at the production line and 
are supplied to the reception devices from which incomplete 

products have been removed, namely supplied at a supply 
point (9) formed on a conveying line which is at the production 

line and at the circulation track. 
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that 
the incomplete products are discarded before the end of the 

circulation track respectively before the supply point (9). 
Process according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
in the region of the circulation track, the reception devices 

from which incomplete products have been removed, i.e. the free 
reception devices, are supplied with complete products from a 

store (15). 
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to at 
least one of claims 1 to 4, with a succession of reception 

devices (11), along a production line (1) formed by a plurality 
of controlled or regulated feeder stations (H,V
1
-V
3
), 
characterised in that, at the downstream end of the production 

line (1) formed by a plurality of feeder stations (H,V
1
-V
3
), 
the reception devices (11) are connected at least for conveying 

capability with a circulation track (4) which guides reception 
devices (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
downstream end of the production line (1) and the circulation  

 
track (4) together form a transfer point (6) for all 

products (12, 13) and a supply point (9) for replacement 
products or remanufactured products (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
transfer point (6), as seen in the conveying direction of the 

products (12, 13) on the circulation track (4), comes before 
the supply point (9). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that a 
delivery location (10) is provided on the circulation 

track (4), between the transfer point (6) and the supply 
point (9), as seen in the conveying direction of the 

products (12, 13). 
Apparatus according to claims 6 to 8, characterised in 
that adjoining the conveying end of the production line (1), a 

neighbouring endless circulation track (4) with driven 
reception devices (11) is arranged, and that transfer means (5) 

are provided at least directly between the conveying end of the 
production line (1) and the circulation track (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
production line (1) opens into the circulation track (4) at the 

transfer point (6). 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
circulation track (4) is constructed helically. 
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterised in that 
the production line (1) opens at least indirectly into the 

upstream end of the helical circulation track (4). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 10 and 11, 
characterised in that the ends of the helical circulation 

track (4) form a supply point (9). 
Apparatus according to claims 6 and 13, characterised in 
that a removal point (14) for incomplete products is provided 

in the circulation track (4) before the supply point (9) as 
seen in the conveying direction. 
Apparatus according to claim, one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a storage device (15) for 

complete products (13) is associated with the circulation 
track (4) after the removal point (14).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
circulation track (4) is at least as long as the production 

line (1). 
Apparatus according to claims 5 to 16, characterised in 
that it is constructed as an inserting machine and the 

reception devices (11) are constructed to be loaded from above 
like pockets and for opening at their bottom portion. 
Apparatus according to claims 5 to 16, characterised in 
that it is constructed as a gatherer stitcher and the reception 

devices (11) as gathering-capable stitching saddles. 
Apparatus according to claim 17, characterised in that 
the production line (1) of the apparatus constructed as an 

inserting machine opens into a helical circulation track (4) 
having more than one turn. 
Apparatus according to claim 19, characterised in that 
the upper and the lower circulation track (4) form a supply 

point (9) for two pocket-like reception devices (11) in 
approximately vertical communication, coming after the removal 

point (14).
