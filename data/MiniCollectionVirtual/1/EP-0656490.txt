<ABSTRACT>
A gear device improved in lowering the product of the load F 
acting on a pair of intermeshing teeth and the relative 

sliding velocity v at the area of contact of the gears, 
thereby minimizing the frictional heat. The gear device 

includes a first gear and a second gear each having a tooth 
profile formed by an involute curve. At least one of the 

first and second gears is provided with the tooth profile 
corrected by a combination of a correction curve W and the 

involute curve. On plane coordinates consisting of an x 
axis, an origin and a y axis which intersects with the x 

axis at the origin, the correction curve W is expressed by 
equations passing through points P₁ (x₁, y₁) and P₂ (x₂, y₂) 

and satisfying the conditions of: y=0, 

dy/dx=0 
 
 at the origin 

when x₁
<
x₂ and y₁
<
y₂. The x axis is the line of action 
indicative of a locus along which an intermeshing point 

moves while the first gear transmits a force to the second 
gear. The origin is a point at which the x axis intersects 

with an intermeshing pitch circle of the first and second 
gears.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gear device and a method of
producing such a gear device as set forth in the preamble of
claims 1 and 8. A gear device and a method of producing such a
gear device are known from US-A-4 640 149, which discloses a
tooth gear which has a combination of an involute and a non-involute
profile. For the gear teeth disclosed in the prior
art publication it is typical that they have a constant
relative curvature at all points of contact and have a high
profile contact ratio of at least 2. Figs. 19 and 20 illustrate a configuration obtained
by performing two types of the tooth-profile correction on a
conventional gear. Portion a indicates a rack-like shape
obtained by developing an involute curve for forming the
tooth profile of the gear into a straight line. Portion b
indicates the configuration obtained by performing the
tooth-profile correction over a range of portions g and h.
The values g and h are described in general literature of
this technical field (which literature is exemplified in the
portion marked with "*"; hereinafter, "*" means the same).
The portions filled in with black indicate those which have
been shaved (hereinafter, such portions mean the same). In
other words, the outer line including such portions
indicates the rack-like shape obtained by developing the 
involute curve into a straight line, while the inner line
excluding such portions indicates the configuration of the
tooth profile which has been corrected. The inner line of
portion b in Fig. 19 is indicated by a straight line, while
that in Fig. 20 is indicated by a circular arc having an radius
r.A pair of gears formed in the shape as described above
are intermeshing with each other as illustrated in Fig. 21.
For transmitting a torque of a gear 1 to a gear 2, the tooth
intermeshing starts at point P on the line of action C
(length of intermeshing) and ends at point R via points O
and Q. Fig. 21 shows a pitch circle d1 of the gear 1, a
pitch circle d2 of the gear 2, a base circle e1 of the gear
1, a base circle e2 of the gear 2, an addendum circle f1 of
the gear 1, an addendum circle f2 of the gear 2, and pitch
point O at which the relative sliding velocity at the tooth
surface becomes zero.The states of intermeshing the gears 1 and 2 from
starting point P to end point R will now be explained with
reference to Figs. 22A - 22E.Fig. 22A shows the state in which the gears 1 and 2 are
intermeshing at point Q11 on the line of action C and at which
the intermeshing point Q11 moves to the right side of
