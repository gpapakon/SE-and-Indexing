<ABSTRACT>
Coating powders are characterized in that they contain as film-forming material a mixture of (A) 19.9 to 90.0 % by weight of an epoxy groups-containing synthetic resin containing if required ethylenically unsaturated double bonds or a mixture of such epoxy groups-containing synthetic resins; (B) 9.9 to 80.0 % by weight of a carboxyl groups-containing compound containing if required ethylenically unsaturated double bonds or a mixture of such carboxyl groups-containing compounds; (C) 0 to 20 % by weight of a compound containing ethylenically unsaturated double bonds different from (A) and (B) or a mixture of such compounds; and (D) 0.1 to 3.0 % by weight of an initiator of radical chain polymerisation or a mixture of initiators of radical chain polymerisation. The percentages by weight of (A) + (B) + (C) + (D) = 100 % by weight and the mixture of the components (A), (B), (C) and (D) contains 0.1 to 6.0 moles of ethylenically unsaturated double bonds, per 1000 g of mixture.
