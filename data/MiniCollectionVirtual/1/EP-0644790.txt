Bowl, for games of bowls, especially for 
pétanque, which includes, on its external face (2), 

patterns, characterized in that these patterns are relief 
patterns (3, 103), with respect to a base surface (4), 

uniformly distributed over at least 90 % of the totality 
of the said base surface (4), the surface area occupied 

by all the relief patterns (3, 103) on the base surface 
(4) representing at least 30 % of the said base surface 

(4), the said relief patterns (3, 103) being bordered by 
substantially cylindrical surfaces (5) whose generatrices 

(6) are parallel to within a small angle, called the 
angle of draft, (D₁), making it easier to disengage the 

tool during the process for obtaining the bowl produced 
by forging, closed-die forging or by casting. 
Bowl according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
each relief pattern (3, 103) occupies from 0.01 % to 

0.5 % of the base surface (4), the surface area of all 
the relief patterns (3, 103) representing at least 70 % 

of the external face (2). 
Bowl according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
all the relief patterns (3, 103) are connected to each 

other, revealing indentation patterns separated from each 
other, in the region of the base surface (4), the said 

indentation patterns occupying from 0.01 % to 0.5 % of 
the base surface (4), the surface area of all the indentation 

patterns representing from 10 to 70 % of the said 
external face (2). 
Bowl according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the said bowl (1) is hollow and has, on 

its internal face (7), relief patterns or indentation 
patterns (8, 108) bordered by substantially cylindrical 

surfaces (9) whose generatrices (21) are parallel to 
within a small angle, called the angle of draft, (D₂
). 
Bowl according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the patterns (3, 103, 8) on the internal 

face (7) and/or external face (2) of the bowl (1) have a  
 

cross section which decreases from the pole (11) of the 
hemispheres (1a, 1b) constituting the bowl (1) to the 

equatorial plane (12). 
Bowl according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the sections of the cylindrical surfaces 

(5) through the external face (2) of the bowl (1) are 
substantially equal. 
Bowl according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the patterns (103) on the external face 

(2) of the bowl (1) have a trapezoidal shape and are 
distributed over the base surface (4) along lines of 

longitude (13) and lines of latitude (14) of the bowl 
(1), leaving spaces of constant width (
f
) between each 
trapezoidally-shaped pattern (103). 
Bowl according to one of Claims 4 to 7, characterized 
in that each relief pattern or indentation 

pattern (8) on the internal face (7) projects, along the 
said parallel generatrices (21), at least partially, from 

the zone occupied on the base surface (4) respectively by 
an indentation pattern or relief pattern (3, 103). 
Bowl according to one of Claims 4 to 8, characterized 
in that the poles (11) and/or the equatorial zone 

(15
a
 [sic], 15
b
 [sic]) include(s) bosses (15) on the 

internal face (7). 
Bowl according to one of Claims 4 to 9, characterized 
in that the patterns (108) are partitioned by 

radial dividers 109 on the internal face (7) of the 
bowl (1). 
Bowl according to one of Claims 4 to 10, characterized 
in that an annular central slot (18
a
, 18
b
) is 
made in the thickness of the wall, of the two hemispheres, 

located in the equatorial plane, and receives a 
centring ring (16). 
Process for obtaining a bowl made by joining 
together two hemispherical shells obtained by forging or 

closed-die forging, characterized in that the bowl is 
according to one of Claims 4 to 11, the angles of draft 

(D₁, D₂) making it easier to disengage the tool.  
 
Process for obtaining a bowl made by joining 
together two hemispherical shells obtained by casting, 

characterized in that the bowl is according to one of 
Claims 4 to 11, the angles of draft (D₁, D₂) making it 

easier to disengage the tool.
