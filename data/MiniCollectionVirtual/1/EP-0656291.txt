<ABSTRACT>
In a method of controlling antilocking brakes 
employed in a vehicle such as a motorcycle, the 

braking force for each of the brakes is determined at a 
time that a wheel acceleration/ deceleration is about 

zero and a friction coefficient of the road surface 
computed from said braking force. The computed 

coefficient and previously computed coefficients are 
averaged when a slip ratio determined at the time of 

zero deceleration is converging to the previously 
determined slip ratio, but the averaging is stopped and 

re-started with that coefficient and subsequently 
measured coefficients if the slip ratio diverges from 

the previously determined slip ratio. This allows a 
more accurate determination of the friction coefficient, 

for example when the road state changes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
controlling antilocking brakes employed in a
vehicle, a motorcycle, etc.A system for controlling antilocking brakes has
been employed in a vehicle, a motorcycle, etc., for
example.As a type of brake control system, there is known
one
(see, for example, EP 0392686 (General Motors))
in which a slip ratio of each wheel with respect to
a road surface is computed based on the speed or velocity
(Vc) of a running vehicle and the speed or velocity
(Vw) of each wheel and the optimum braking is applied
to the vehicle based on the computed slip ratio. Here,
the slip ratio represents a value calculated from Vc-Vw/Vc.
Another brake control system is disclosed in DE 3717531 (Tokico).The relationship between the slip ratio of each
wheel with respect to the road surface and a friction
coefficient (µ) relative to the direction of rotation
of each wheel is normally represented as shown in FIG.
1. The slip ratio vs. friction coefficient characteristic
varies depending on the state of the road surface
due to rain, snow or sand or the like. However, the µ
value shows the peak in the slip ratio range of 10% to
20%. Therefore, the braking control can be carried out 
by causing the slip ratio to converge to a range in the
vicinity of the slip ratio range of 10% to 20%.The relationship between a friction coefficient
(µ) in the lateral or transverse direction (normal to
the direction of the rotation) of each wheel and the
slip ratio is then represented as shown in FIG. 2. In
case of a road surface (hereinafter called a "low µ
road") of a low friction coefficient, such as a frozen
snow surface, the value of µ of the transverse direction
of each wheel is reduced as compared with a road
surface (hereinafter called a "high µ road") of a high
friction coefficient, such as an asphalt road surface.
It is therefore preferable to ensure the stability of
the vehicle by setting a target slip ratio to a low
value in the low µ road.On the other hand, both a lock speed and a return
or reset speed of each wheel with respect to the caliper
pressure also vary greatly depending on µ of the
road surface. In case of the high µ road, the lock
speed is slow and the reset speed is fast. In case of
the low µ road to the contrary, the reset speed is slow
and the lock speed is fast (see FIG. 3). Thus, when
the braking control is made at the same operation speed
in varying the caliper pressure (hereinafter called a
"pressure increasing and reducing rate") in spite of
the fact that a difference is developed

A method of controlling brakes, comprising steps

of:
determining a braking force for each of said brakes

at the time that a wheel acceleration/deceleration has
reached about zero;
computing friction coefficients of a road surface
from said determined braking force;
averaging the present friction coefficient, the
previous friction coefficient and friction coefficients

ratio determined at the time that said wheel

acceleration/deceleration is substantially zero is
converging to the previously-determined slip ratio; and
stopping a process for averaging said present
friction coefficient, said previous friction coefficient

and said friction coefficients so as to start a process
for averaging new friction coefficients including the

present friction coefficient when the slip ratio
determined at the time that said acceleration/deceleration

is substantially zero is diverging from

and rear wheel, and said friction coefficients of said
right front and rear wheels and said friction

position of an expander piston constituting an anti-locking
modulator and from the torque of a rotatative

drive source for driving said expander piston.
