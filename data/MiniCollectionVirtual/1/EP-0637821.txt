<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a substrate of a magnetic recording medium in 
the form of an annular disk made from a single crystal of silicon 

which is imparted with greatly improved mechanical strengths to 
withstand mechanical shocks and high-velocity revolution. Different 

from conventional annular disks as formed by a mechanical 
working to form the outer contour and the circular center opening, 

the peripheral surfaces of the inventive annular disk are freed 
from the work-stressed surface layer by a chemical etching treatment 

undertaken after the mechanical working.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved substrate of a
magnetic recording medium, referred to simply as a substrate
hereinafter, such as a disk prepared, for example, from a wafer of a
single crystal of silicon.Along with the rapid progress of the information-predominant
society in recent years, the demand is also rapidly increasing
for large-capacity recording media for information used in computers
and other electronic data-processing machines. In particular, it
is a remarkable trend that magnetic memory disks which play a
core role as an external memory unit in computers are required to
have a recording capacity and recording density increasing year by
year so that intensive and extensive investigations are now under
way to develop a magnetic memory disk suitable for high-density
recording. Besides the increased recording density mentioned
above, the development works on one hand are directed to a magnetic
recording disk having improved mechanical strengths in
view of the recent progress in very compact portable computers
such as the so-called notebook-type or palm-top personal computers
of which the recording system naturally must be capable of
withstanding mechanical shocks. If not to mention mechanical
shocks, magnetic recording disks must have high mechanical 
strengths to withstand the considerably high velocity of revolution
when they are under operation as is mentioned later.As is known, the most conventional material for the substrates,
which is made from a non-magnetic material and has an
annular form of a disk with a circular outer contour and provided
with an also circular concentric center opening, is an aluminum-based
alloy while, as a trend, aluminum alloy-made substrates
cannot meet the increasing requirements for a smaller surface
roughness to enable an increase in the recording density as well as
higher abrasion resistance to ensure longer durability of the magnetic
disks. These requirements necessitate the use of a material
having an increased hardness. Along with the development of very
compact computers, in particular, it is essential that the power
consumption for driving of the magnetic disk is as small as possible.
In this regard, the substrate must be as light as possible although
a large part of the power in magnetic disk driving is consumed
in the spindle motor per se. In other words, a substrate material
having a smaller specific gravity than aluminum-based alloys
is desired.Needless to say, the coercive force of the magnetic recording
layer is an important factor to

<CLAIMS>
A method for the preparation of a substrate of a magnetic recording medium in
the form of a mechanically formed annular disk of a single crystal of silicon having a

circular center opening in concentricity with the outer contour of the disk
characterized in that it comprises the steps of:


(a) chamfering the outer peripheral surface and the inner peripheral surface of the
annular disk ; and
(b) removing the work-stressed layer from the chamfered peripheral surfaces of the
annular disk by a chemical etching treatment.
The method according to claim 1 in which the edge lines formed by the
mechanical working to form the outer contour and the central opening and by the

chamfering work are, prior to the chemical etching treatment, further worked into a
rounded surface of which the cross sectional profile is a partial arc of circle.
The method as claimed in claim 2 in which the radius of curvature of the rounded
surface does not exceed the thickness of the disk.
