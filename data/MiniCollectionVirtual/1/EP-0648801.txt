<ABSTRACT>
A process for the bonding of substrates selected 
from polyvinyl chloride, cellulosic material, metals, 

polymers of melamine and polymers of phenol is disclosed. 
A layer of a thermoplastic polymer is interposed between 

two of the substrates and heated above its melting point. 
The thermoplastic polymer is a copolymer of ethylene, 

alkyl acrylate and carbon monoxide. In aspects, 
polyvinyl chloride to is bonded to cellulosic material at 

a temperature of less than 90°C to give structures that 
are useful at temperatures of greater than 100°C. The 

process is particularly useful in the manufacture of 
substrates for the manufacture of kitchen cabinets and 

other furniture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
bonding of substrates with solid adhesives, including for 
example the bonding of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to 
cellulosic material. In particular, the invention 
relates to lamination processes that do not use 
polyurethane adhesives. Structures formed from, for example, polyvinyl 
chloride and cellulosic material are known. For 
instance, commercial processes are known for the 
lamination of polyvinyl chloride in sheet form to 
cellulosic material in the form of fibre board panels 
using water-based polyurethane adhesives. The resultant 
products may be used in the fabrication of a variety of 
products, including cabinets and other structures, for 
example kitchen cabinets. Such lamination using 
polyurethane adhesives provides a product with 
commercially-acceptable properties. However, the use of 
polyurethane adhesives in lamination processes represents 
an occupational health risk and major precautions must be 
taken during operation of the process in order to protect 
the personnel involved. Thus, it would be desirable to 
have alternate processes that do not use polyurethane 
adhesives. In addition, it would be advantageous to the 
trade to be able to apply the adhesive in one location 
e.g. onto the polyvinyl chloride, and be able to ship the 
coated polyvinyl chloride to another location for bonding 
to the cellulosic material. Structures of polyvinyl chloride and cellulosic 
materials e.g. fibre board panels may have a number of 
property requirements, other than provision of adequate 
adhesion, for the intended end use at ambient 
temperatures. For instance, if the panels are to be used 
in the form of kitchen cabinets, the cabinets may be 
subjected to heat even though the cabinets are installed  
 
in a kitchen. Cabinets located adjacent to an oven may 
be subjected to heat significantly above ambient 
temperature during use of the oven, especially during 
cleaning cycles of self-cleaning ovens. A shear adhesion 
fail test has been developed for estimating the maximum 
temperature of use of an adhesive subject to shear 
stress; the test (ASTM D4498) involves determining the 
temperature at which the adhesive fails. In order to 
pass the test, kitchen cabinet structures are required to 
have a temperature of failure in the test of at least 
100°C. One aspect of the invention relates to such 
product requirements. With regard to the aspect discussed above, processes 
for lamination of polyvinyl chloride to fibre board 
panels normally
