<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method for 
ply-twisting nylon yarns at twisting speeds greater than 
6000 rpm. More particularly, the invention involves 
coating the nylon fibers with less than about 1% by 
weight of finish containing an alkyl polyoxyalkylene 
carboxylate ester lubricant composition. The resulting 
ply-twisted yarn is especially suitable for use as pile 
in carpets. Typical carpets used in residences include loop 
pile and cut pile carpets. These carpets are made by 
inserting heat-set, ply-twisted pile yarn into a backing 
material. For loop pile carpets, the loops are not cut. 
For cut pile carpets, which are more common, the loops 
are cut to form substantially parallel vertical tufts. The yarns which are used in such carpets are 
prepared by cable-twisting, or ply-twisting, two yarns 
together, and heat-setting them in their twisted 
condition. Problems in ply-twisting such yarns are 
discussed in Polejes, J. D., "Principles of Cable Twister 
Design and Operation", Canadian Textile Journal, 
September 1984, pp. 56-65. Generally, a conventional apparatus for 
ply-twisting the yarns includes a means for feeding one 
yarn vertically upward from a stationary yarn supply 
package, located in a yarn supply bucket, and rotating 
another yarn around the first to form a twisted, combined 
yarn. The path of the rotating yarn is known as a 
"balloon". A guide, such as a fixed ring or jacket, is 
used for guiding and restricting the yarn in the balloon.  
 
As the yarn travels in the balloon, it comes into 
physical contact with the guide. These guides, or 
limiters, provide a means for controlling or limiting the 
extent and tension of the yarn in the balloon and are 
discussed in more detail in such patents as, Kresslein, 
US-A-3,065,592, Nimtz et al., US-A-3,094,835, 
and GB-A-1,094,071. A significant problem in using such conventional 
balloon guides is the high degree of friction created 
between the guides and the yarn in the balloon. While 
wind-up speeds are about 100 meters/minute, the speed of 
the threadline traversing the balloon limiter can exceed 
10,000 meters/minute. This high speed contact between 
the balloon limiter and yarn results in generating 
polymer dust, broken filaments, deposits on the limiter, 
and irregular tension or breaks of the entire yarn. 
Furthermore, these problems become more pronounced as 
twisting speeds are raised to attain greater productivity 
of the twisting equipment. Thus, a conventional solution for ply-twisting 
nylon bulked continuous

A process for ply-twisting nylon bulked continuous 
filament yarns which have been lubricated with a finish oil 

comprising the steps of: feeding a creel nylon yarn through a 
tensioning device and onto a storage disc rotating at a speed 

of at least about 6000 rpm, whereby the yarn emerges from the 
disc and forms a balloon; contacting the yarn in the balloon 

with a balloon limiter as the yarn passes from the disc to a 
guide; and feeding a bucket nylon yarn through a separate 

tensioning device where the creel yarn exits from the balloon 
and wraps around the bucket yarn to form a ply-twisted yarn;
 
   characterized in that the creel and bucket yarns are 

treated with from about 0.3 to about 1.0% by weight of a finish 
oil comprising a compound having the general formula:
