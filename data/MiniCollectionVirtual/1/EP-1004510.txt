<ABSTRACT>
A process and assembly at least partially sterilize a web of material e.g. plastic sheeting which is to be used as packaging material. The face of the plastic sheeting which is to be in contact with the packaging contents is sterilized by exposure to an array of jets emitting saturated superheated steam. The sterilized web is then fed through a sterile tunnel (at slightly above atmospheric pressure) forming part of the packaging machine. The steam is brought to the superheated state immediately prior to its emission from the jets by the controlled addition of heat. The array of jets covers the entire width of the web. The steam forms a condensation film which dries in the tunnel prior to use of the web for packaging.

A process for germ reduction and cleansing at least the loading-material-sided
surface of a sheet of packing material (PB) passing through a sterilizing passage

chamber (2) by means of overheated steam sprayed through at least one nozzle (5),

tunnel (3) of a packing machine and the sterilizing passage chamber (2) and the sterile
tunnel, relative to the atmosphere, being held at a slight excess pressure,
characterized in

that
 saturated steam is supplied to the nozzle (5), with the saturated steam prior to being
applied to the section of the sheet of packing material contained in the sterilizing

passage chamber (2) and introduced in dry condition into the chamber (2), through
controlled energy supply, is overheated immediately before being sprayed, and that the

said overheated steam with a substantially uniform intensity across the entire length of
at least one transverse line of the sheet of packing material is sprayed onto said sheet of

packing material, forming a condensate film.

characterized in

that
 the condensate film formed on the surface of the sheet of packing material steamed
in the passage chamber (2) is thereafter subjected to a condensate absorption before

that
 the hot steam is sprayed at an inclination relative to the sheet of packing material
and in the passage direction thereof.

 the section of the sheet of packing material is held in movement relative to the
sprayed hot steam.
A process according to any one of claims 1 through 4,
characterized in

that
 in a cyclical transport of the sheet of packing material through the sterilizing
passage chamber (2), the steam is sprayed in
 a corresponding cyclical way.
A process for germ reduction and cleansing at least the loading-material-sided
surface of a sheet of packing material (PB) passing through a sterilizing passage

chamber (2) by means of overheated steam sprayed through at least one nozzle (5),

sterile tunnel (3) of a packing machine and the sterilizing passage chamber (2) and the
sterile tunnel, relative to the atmosphere, being held at a slight excess pressure,
characterized in

that
 saturated steam is supplied to the nozzle (5)), with the saturated steam prior to
being applied to the section of the sheet of packing material contained in the sterilizing

passage chamber (2) and cyclically introduced, in dry condition, into the chamber (2),
through controlled energy supply, is overheated immediately before being sprayed and

the said overheated steam, within a steam-stowing space (12) formed above the section
of the sheet of packing material to be treated, is sprayed with a substantially identical

intensity, inside the steam-stowing space kept closed during steaming, across the entire
surface of the sheet of packing material, forming a condensate film.
A process according to claim 6,
characterized in

that
 the condensate film formed on the surface of the sheet of packing material as
steamed in the steam-stowing space (12), with the steam-stowing space opened, is 

thereafter subjected to a condensate absorption before leaving the sterilizing passage
chamber (2).
A process according to claims 6 or 7,
characterized in

that
 spraying of the hot steam is effected with the steam-stowing space (12) held
closed.
The process according to any one of claims 1 through 8,
characterized in

that
 the resultant excess steam contained in the sterilizing chamber (2) is absorbed
therefrom.
A process according to any one of claims 1 through 9,
characterized in
