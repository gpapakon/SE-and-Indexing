<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the application relates to controllable power semiconductor components such as, for example, IGBTs and thyristors, which have an n-type buffer region (2) which is doped relatively weakly in comparison to known components, a relatively flat p-type emitter (3) and an n-type base (1) with comparatively high charge-carrier lifetime. The advantage obtained with the subject-matter of the application essentially resides in that the controllable power semiconductor component has a temperature-independent tail current despite a low on-state resistance and a high blocking voltage when switching off.
