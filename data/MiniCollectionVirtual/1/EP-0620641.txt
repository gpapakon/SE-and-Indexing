Signal processing device, characterized in that 
it includes a single digital filter (6), the cutoff 

frequency of which depends on the frequency of sampling 

of the signal present at its input and possessing a 
single predetermined frequency attenuation template (32) 

compatible with a plurality of substantially homothetic 
predetermined elementary frequency attenuation templates 

(20; 23; 26; 29) and associated with different types of 
signals capable of being processed. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises a first input (E1) and a first output 

(S1) capable respectively of receiving and delivering a 
plurality of analog signals and corresponding digital 

signals having different predetermined types of transmission 
specifications (G711, G722) and associated with 

substantially homothetic predetermined elementary 
frequency attenuation templates (23, 29), a second input 

(E2) and a second output (S2) capable respectively of 
receiving and delivering a plurality of digital signals 

and corresponding analog signals having different predetermined 
types of transmission specifications (G711, 

G722) associated with different, substantially homothetic 
predetermined elementary frequency attenuation templates 

(20, 26), as well as first and second signal conversion 
means arranged respectively between the first input and 

output and between the second input and output and 
including the said single digital filter (10) in common. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that it comprises two transmission channels respectively 

linking the two inputs (E1, E2) and the two corresponding 
outputs (S1, S2), these two channels possessing a common 

serial bus (19) on which the said single serial digital 
filter (6) is connected, as well as means (5a, 5b) for 

multiplexing and demultiplexing the digital samples 
originating from the signals received on the two inputs 

(E1, E2). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the second channel linking the digital signal input  

 
(E2) to the output of the analog signal (S2) includes 

means (12) for oversampling the input digital signal, 
preceding the single digital filter (6), while the first 

channel, linking the analog signal input (E1) to the 
digital signal output (S1) includes means (7) for subsampling 

the digital signal originating from the digital 
filter (6). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4, in 
which, for a pair of corresponding analog and digital 

signals with the same transmission specifications, the 
elementary frequency attenuation templates are different 

over the first channel and over the second channel, 
characterized in that the frequency attenuation template 

(32) of the single digital filter (6) is chosen on the 
basis of the most severe elementary frequency attenuation 

templates (23, 29) associated respectively with all the 
pairs of signals capable of being processed. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 5, characterized 
in that the first channel includes an analog/ 

digital coder (3) with shaping the noise spectrum, such 
as a delta-sigma coder, followed by a digital filter (4) 

of the blocker type, 

in that the single digital filter (6) incorporates 
a blocking circuit of order chosen to compensate 

for the effect of the digital filter (4) of the blocker 
type, 
in that the second channel includes a digital/ 
analog coder (15) with shaping of the noise spectrum, 

such as a delta-sigma coder, the working frequency of 
which is higher than that of the digital signal originating 

from the single digital filter (6) 
and in that an interpolating digital filter (14) 
is provided between the output of the digital filter (6) 

and the input of the digital/analog coder (15). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the single digital filter (6) is an 

infinite-impulse-response recursive ladder filter. 
Device according to Claims 2 and 7 taken in 
combination, characterized in that the first and second  

 
conversion means are able to process signals having 

transmission specifications defined by the CCITT G722 and 
CCITT G711 standards, and in that the recursive filter is 

a serial filter of the pole-zero type of order at least 
equal to 8. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that it further comprises means able to modify the 

working frequency of the single digital filter as a 
function of the transmission standard used. 
Device according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized 
in that it comprises means able to divide, by two, the 

working frequency of all the elements of the device.
