<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an eosinophil chemotaxis 
inhibitor composition and a pharmaceutical composition 
for the treatment of diseases involving eosinophilic 
infiltration or eosinophilia, such as allergic 
rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, etc., each comprising a 
condensed pyridazine derivative or a salt thereof. In allergic diseases, various chemical mediators 
such as leukotrienes B₄, C₄ and D₄, prostaglandins E₂, 
F2α and I₂, thromboxane A₂, platelet activating factor 
(PAF), histamine, heparin, serotonin, allyl sulfatase, 
neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF), eosinophil 
chemotactic factor (ECF-A), etc. are released from mast 
cells at the local sites of reaction to cause allergic 
responses. These allergic responses can be controlled 
by inhibiting the release of such chemical mediators or 
antagonizing their actions. These chemical mediators 
further trigger the chemotaxis of eosinophils, 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages and 
induce allergic responses of the infiltrated cells. 
The eosinophils, in particular, reach high levels in 
the circulating blood and nasal discharge and G. J. 
Gleich and coworkers "J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 80, 
412-415, 1987" report that eosinophilic infiltration is 
involved in a great measure in atopic dermatitis, 
allergic rhinitis and other allergic diseases. 
Furthermore, an elevation of eosinophil count is found 
in parasitogenic diseases and eosinophilia and it is 
not true that all antiallergic agents inhibit 
eosinophil infiltration. Meanwhile, EP-A-381132, EP-A-440119 and EP-A-444549, 
among others, describe compounds each 
consisting of an imidazopyridazine skeleton and a side 
chain attached to the skeleton through a hetero-atom 
and EP-A-548923, for instance, describes compounds each  
 
consisting of an imidazopyridazine and 
triazolopyridazine skeleton and a side chain attached 
to the skeleton through a carbon atom. These compounds 
are known to have antiinflammatory and antiallergic 
properties based on anti-PAF activity and, as such, may 
be of value as antiasthmatic agents but there is no 
reference to inhibition of eosinophil infiltration. There has been a standing need to this day for a 
new eosinophil chemotaxis inhibitor, a therapeutic 
agent for allergic rhinitis and a therapeutic agent for 
atopic dermatitis, each of which would show inhibitory 
activity against eosinophil infiltration, that is to 
say an inhibitory effect on the chemotaxis of 
eosinophils, and no potential of causing adverse 
reactions. For the purpose of
