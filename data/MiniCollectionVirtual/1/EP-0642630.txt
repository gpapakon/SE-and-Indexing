<ABSTRACT>
A clamping device (1), in particular for securing an axially movable bar (3) in desired setting positions, has a rolling body (17) which is supported for clamping purposes on a surrounding housing (5). In order to obtain a simple design, the rolling body (9) is arranged in the head (9) of a lever which has a push-button (11) at its end opposite to its head (9) which extends outwards through the housing (5); the rolling body (17) is supported on a wall section of the housing (5) whose inner face is designed as a slanted plane (19).

<CLAIMS>
Clamping device (1) for fixing an axially displaceable rod (3) in any desired setting 
positions, in which a rotatable body (17) is, for clamping, supported at a surrounding 

housing (5) and is clamped between the housing and the rod, characterised thereby that 
the rollable body (17) is arranged in a lever head (9) of a lever (6), which has at its end 

remote from the lever head (9) a pushbutton (11) guided outwardly through the housing 
(5), and bears against an inner wall portion, which is formed as an inclined plane, of the 

housing (5) as well as against the rod (3). 
Clamping device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the lever (6) 
consists of two mutually parallel arms (7), which on the one hand are connected together 

at their one end by way of a transverse web (8) of the lever head (9) and on the other hand 
are connected together by way of the pushbutton (11), which is arranged at the other arm 

ends in diagonal position with respect to the transverse web (8). 
Clamping device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the lever 
head (9) is mounted to be pivotably movable on axles (21) arranged in oppositely disposed 

housing walls (5a, 5b). 
Clamping device according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby 
that the rollable body (17) is loosely laid into open recesses (16) of the arms (7) of the 

lever (6). 
Clamping device according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby 
that the pushbutton (11) receives, in an inner chamber, a compression spring (13) 

supported against the rod (3). 
Clamping device according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby 
that the housing is open at its side remote from the pushbutton (11).
