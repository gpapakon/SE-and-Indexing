<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a reluctance motor. The significant features of the reluctance motor according to the invention are that the geometrical arrangement and design of the stator poles and actuator poles and the time response of the inductance and excitation current have been matched and optimised to one another. The actuator poles, which can be excited magnetically, represent regular hexagons which are wound from laminates in the form of strips and whose opposite tips are cut off, as a result of which two halves are produced which are separately provided with windings. The magnetic circuit is accordingly directed at right angles to the movement direction of the actuator, and the laminates of the stator pole and actuator pole run crossed over with respect to one another. The advantages achieved using the invention are essentially that the reluctance motor has a very uniform power effect and thus improved quiet running, that the stator does not consist of long laminates as in the past but of short laminate elements and production is in consequence simple and extremely cheap, and that the free intermediate space between the stator poles can be used for cooling purposes.
