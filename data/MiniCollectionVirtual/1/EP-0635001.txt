<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
copending application Serial No. 07/866,375, filed 
April 9, 1992, which is incorporated herein by 
reference. This invention relates to chelating agents useful 
for coupling metal ions to biologically active 
molecules. It has been discovered that antibodies and 
certain peptides can be used as highly specific 
vehicles for the delivery of drugs or radioisotopes to 
target organs, tumors or thrombi in vivo. Methods 
have been reported for the direct labeling of antibodies 
with radioisotopes (Huang et al., 1980, J. 
Nucl. Med. 21:783; Rhodes et al., in "Tumor Imaging", 
Burchiel and Rhodes, eds., Masson: New York, p. 111, 
1982; and Sundrehagen, 1982, Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 
7:549), taking advantage of partial reduction of 
protein disulfide linkages to generate free thiol 
groups capable of binding radiometals such as 
technetium. Because not all proteins or peptides 
contain readily reducible disulfides and partial 
reduction may alter the biological activity relative 
to the native molecule, it would be desirable to 
utilize a bifunctional radiometal chelator to form a 
covalent radiometal-chelator-peptide/protein conjugate 
capable of targeting radiometals in-vivo. Of particular interest in nuclear medicine is the 
radiometal technetium-99m, which is a preferred 
isotope for scintigraphic imaging applications 
(Pinkerton et al., 1985, J. Chem. Educ. 62:965).  
 
Technetium is one of a class of metal ions that form 
strong coordinate bonds with sulfur-containing 
compounds, particularly thiols (e.g., metallothonein), 
but also thioureas (Koponec et al. 1977, Radiochem. 
Radioanal. Lett. 29:171). Koponec et al. describe the 
binding of technetium by thioureas to form complexes. 
This illustrates that thiocarbonyl functional groups 
bind technetium and thus may be useful as one part of 
a technetium binding bifunctional chelator. The use of radiolabelled chelator conjugates may 
be preferable over the direct labeling systems for a 
number of reasons. First, the chelator may provide 
metal complexes of greater in vivo stability. A 
second advantage arises if a metabolically cleavable 
group is included in the linking portion of the 
bifunctional chelator to allow for rapid clearance and 
decreased accumulation of radiolabelled protein in 
non-targeted tissue. Lastly, direct labeling may 
require attachment of the radioisotope to functional 
groups of the protein which may lower or otherwise 
interfere with the in vivo targeting of the peptide or 
protein. A
