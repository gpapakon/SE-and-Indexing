<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel benzopyrans having pharmacological 
activity, to a process for preparing them, to pharmaceutical compositions containing 
them, and to their use as smooth muscle relaxants in the treatment of hypertension and 
urinary incontinence via potassium channel modulation. Recent reviews of potassium channel modulators are by: Longman et al., 
Medicinal Research Reviews,1992, 12, 73; Robertson et al., J. Med. Chem.1990, 
33, 1529; Weston et al., TiPS1990, 11, 417; and Evans et al., Ann. Rep. Med. 
Chem.1991, 26, 73. Ashwood et al. disclose classes of chromans that are described 
as having blood pressure lowering activity in U.S. Pat. No. 4,616,021 and European 
Patent Publication 158,923. Quagliato et al. disclose classes of chromans that are 
described as having blood pressure lowering activity in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,925,839 and 
4,983,612. In addition, Soll et al. disclose a related class of chromans in U.S. Pat. 
No. 4,908,378. Yamanaka et al. disclose a series of hydrazido and hydrazino 
substituted chromans as having extremely long acting vasodilatory effects in EP 
339,562-A2. Bruneau et al. disclose the synthesis of classes of substituted indazoles in 
European Patent Application 284,174 Al, although these compounds are described as 
inhibitors of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase and thus useful in the area of inflammation. Accordingly, the present invention discloses compounds represented by the 
formula (I):
