<ABSTRACT>
In order to prepare crosslinked polymer mouldings, thermoplastic base polymers in flowable form are mixed with likewise flowable support polymers which are dispersible or soluble in the base polymer in the presence of a crosslinking agent. These mutually compatible components are warmed, with further mixing, to a reaction temperature above the melting range of the base polymer and are processed. Inter-polymer-chain bonds formed by reaction of free radicals and/or the polymer chains themselves are degraded. A support polymer which has a porous structure and in each case contain at least one coagent and/or organic peroxide introduced into the finely porous structure in liquid form as a silane-free crosslinking agent are mixed into the base polymer. Peroxide-containing support polymers are warmed, and coagent-containing support polymers are irradiated. The mouldings are used, for example, for cable and sheath insulations, pipes for hot-water lines and heavy-duty injection mouldings.

A process for the production of crosslinked polymeric mouldings based
on pourable thermoplastic polymers which are mixed with pourable carrier

polymers dispersible or soluble in the basic polymers with a crosslinking
agent and these mutually compatible components are heated with continued

mixing to a reaction temperature above the melting range of the basic
polymer and processed at that temperature, the reaction of free radicals

forming bonds between polymer chains and/or breaking down polymer
chains, characterized in that a porous carrier polymer which contains at least

one organic peroxide and/or coagent introduced in liquid form into the fine-pore
structure as a silane-free crosslinking agent is incorporated in the basic

polymer by mixing and the resulting mixture is processed in the absence of
air in a closed system under a pressure of at least 3 bar.
