<ABSTRACT>
In a demounting aid for rubber/impression blankets, the object is to provide a device without tools for the reliable and rapid removal of one end of an impression blanket from a cylinder gap. According to the invention, this is achieved in that there is arranged a pushing-out element which can enter a groove of the cylinder gap.

Cylinder (2) for receiving a rubber blanket or printing
blanket (10) for a rotary printing machine, with a hang-in groove

(54) opening into a cylinder pit (1) and intended for an enclosed
end (51) of the rubber blanket or printing blanket (10),

characterized in that the hang-in groove (54) is stationary in
relation to the cylinder (2) and in that a shiftable device (77,

76, 73, 78) for pushing out the enclosed end (51) of the rubber
blanket/printing blanket (10) from the hang-in groove (54) is

provided.
Cylinder (2) according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
pushing-out device (77, 76, 73, 78) has at least one pushing-out

element (73), which penetrates into the hang-in groove (54) at
times.
Cylinder (2) according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that the pushing-out element (73) is displaceable against the

force of at least one spring (79).
Cylinder (2) according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the spring (79) is arranged at the periphery of a tensioning

spindle (14) mounted in the cylinder pit (1).
Cylinder (2) according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the spring (79) is arranged fixed to the cylinder pit.
Cylinder (2) according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the tensioning spindle (14) has a flattened portion (81) on

one side, behind its receiving slot (16) as seen in the
tensioning direction, for receiving the spring (79).
Cylinder (2) according to Claims 1 to 3 and 5, characterized
in that the spring (79) is arranged on a holder fixed to the

cylinder pit. 
Cylinder (2) according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the pushing-out element (73) has a movable pin (74) which

is connected at its first end (76) frictionally and positively
to a piston-cylinder unit (77) and with its second end (78) acts

frictionally against an enclosed end (51) of the one end (48) of
the rubber blanket/printing blanket (10).
Cylinder (2) according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
shiftable device (77, 76, 73, 78) is arranged to act against a

plane side, running in the direction of the rubber blanket (10),
of the enclosed end (51).
Cylinder (2) according to Claim 2, characterized in that the
pushing-out element is arranged to be movable by means of a

camshaft.
