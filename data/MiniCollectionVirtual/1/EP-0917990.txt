<ABSTRACT>
The de-coupling element (1) consists mainly of a damping element (4) with an opening (6) for a cooling fluid and two joint elements (5a,5b). The joint elements (5a,5b) are connected to two short pipes (7a,7b) screwed (8a,8b) to the part to be cooled (2) at one end and to the cooling fluid transport duct (9) at the other end. Both pipes (7a,7b) are covered by a hose (10) for sealing purposes and inserted into the damper element (4).

<CLAIMS>
A de-coupling element for impact- and temperature-sensitive components (2), comprising
a damper element (4) which is connected at its end faces to a respective connexion

element (5a, 5b) in each case, wherein a first connexion element (5b) is attached to the
component (2) and a second connexion element (5a) is attached to a base (3) on which

the component is to be fastened, 
characterized in that
 the damper element (4) has a bore
(6) for the coolant supply, the coolant supply and removal take place by way of the

second connexion element (5a), and the two connexion elements (5a, 5b) are formed by
tube members (7a, 7b) which project into the bore (6) and are used for conveying coolant.
A de-coupling element according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the tube members
(7a, 7b) of the connexion elements (5a, 5b) are connected by a sealing hose (10) and the

sealing hose (10) is surrounded by the damper element (4).
A de-coupling element according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the component
(2) is an electronic control means (11) and the base (3) is an internal-combustion

engine, wherein the fuel is used as the coolant.
A de-coupling element according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the damper element
(4) is surrounded by a jacket of refractory material.
