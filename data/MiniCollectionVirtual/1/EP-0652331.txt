<ABSTRACT>
The acoustic (sound-absorbing) panel according to the invention is based on mineral-fibre wool. It is covered with a perforated impermeable cladding. The perforations together occupy an area of between 7 and 20% of the area of the panel. The area of each perforation is between 3 and 80 mm
<
2
>
. Such a panel makes it possible to obtain a Sabine coefficient  alpha of at least 0.75 for the high frequencies.
