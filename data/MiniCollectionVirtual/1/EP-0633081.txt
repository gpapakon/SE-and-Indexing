<ABSTRACT>
In a vacuum casting method, a molding cavity (6) 
is reduced in pressure to a vacuum, and when a gate (10) is 

opened, a molten metal which has been raised to a molten 
metal retaining dome (8) is charged into the molding cavity 

(6) at a high speed. When a portion of a molten metal held 
in a molten metal holding furnace (22) is raised to the 

molten metal retaining dome (8), an upper surface of the 
molten metal is moved downwardly and upwardly through at 

least one cycle in the molten metal retaining dome (8), or a 
swirl flow is generated in the molten metal in a stalk (20). 

Such a unique motion as the downward and upward motion or 
the swirl flow effectively operates to detach solid metal 

pieces from an inside surface of the molten metal retaining 
dome (8) or the stalk (20) to push them to an upper portion 

of the molten metal. As a result, the detached metal pieces 
are prevented from being charged into the molding cavity (6) 

to thereby cause defects in a cast product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum casting 
method of the type wherein a molding cavity is reduced in 
pressure to a vacuum and upon opening a gate, a molten metal 
is charged into the molding cavity at a high speed. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an improved 
vacuum casting method in which bubbles and solid metal 
pieces are prevented from being involved in the molten metal 
charged into the molding cavity. As one example of a light alloy casting method of 
a high quality and a low cost, a vacuum casting method 
(named by the present applicant as a Vacuum Precharged 
Closed squeezed casting method) was proposed by the present 
applicant in Japanese Patent Application No. HEI 4-309534 
filed on October 23, 1992 (JP-A-51-92759, published 03.08.93). In the proposed vacuum casting method, a molding 
cavity is shut off from an interior of a molten metal 
retaining dome by a gate. Then, the molding cavity is 
reduced in pressure to a vacuum, and substantially 
simultaneously a portion of a molten metal held in a molten 
metal holding furnace is raised to the molten metal 
retaining dome. Then, the gate is opened so that the molten 
metal in the molten metal retaining dome is charged into the  
 
molding cavity at a high speed due to the vacuum in the 
molding cavity. The molding cavity is shut off by a shut 
pin, and then the molten metal in the molding cavity is 
pressurized by inserting a pressure pin into the molding 
cavity. Then, the molten metal in the molding cavity is 
cooled to be solidified. In the proposed vacuum casting method, since the 
molding cavity is reduced in pressure to a vacuum before the 
molten metal is charged, the molten metal in the molding 
cavity has few or no bubbles, so that casting defects due to 
bubbles are avoided and casting quality is improved. 
Further, because of the vacuum generated in the molding 
cavity, the charging speed of the molten metal is very high, 
so that the molten metal can smoothly run in the molding 
cavity and, as a result, slimmer and lighter cast products 
is possible. However, some additional problems remain in the 
above-described vacuum casting method. For example, during 
repeating the casting cycles, solid metal pieces generated 
in the previous casting cycles, which may be additionally 
oxidized, often adhere to an inside surfaces of a stalk 
connecting the molten metal retaining dome and the molten 
metal holding furnace and/or the molten metal retaining 
dome. When the molten metal is raised through the stalk to
