a polymer which contains at least about 30 weight percent azide groups and less 

than about 2 weight percent halogen content; and (b) at least one dipolarophile 
having a reactive group selected from olefins and alkynes, the resulting 

polymer comprising triazole and/or triazoline groups and at least about 15 
weight percent unreacted azide groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to derivatized azide-containing polymers and in
particular, it relates to azide-containing polymers which have been derivatized
with certain dipolarophiles. This invention also relates to aqueous-based
coatings of azide-containing polymers which have been derivatized with
dipolarophiles containing water-solubilizing groups. This invention further
relates to an article coated with azide-containing polymers derivatized with
dipolarophiles. Additionally, the invention relates to a process for coating a
substrate with an azide-containing polymer derivatized with dipolarophiles.Azide-containing compounds and polymers ("azides") are important in
the fields of explosives and propellants because the azide (N3) group is highly
energetic and can be easily incorporated into a polymer or oligomer at high
weight percentage loadings. A useful class of azide materials is the oligomers
or polymers derived from azide-containing cyclic ether monomers, e.g.,
glycidyl azide polymer ("GAP") and bis(azidomethyl)oxetane polymer
("polyBAMO"). Generally, the product of polymerization is a low molecular
weight polymer or oligomer (e.g., 2,000 -10,000 MW). Alternatively, it can
be a higher molecular weight polymer (e.g., 10,000 - 100,000 MW). See, for
example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,694,383; 3,645,917; 4,483,978; and 4,879,419.When used in propellant applications, it is important that the azide-containing
polymers have excellent stability under processing conditions and 
that the final compounded materials have good stability during storage at
elevated temperatures. The desired stability is generally obtained by taking
precautions to ensure that during the preparation of the azide-containing
polymer, the chloride functionality in the precursor is quantitatively converted
to azide, and residual by-products or catalysts are removed. It is believed that
residual chloride in the azide-containing polymer can lead to the generation of
HCl and result in lowered stability and corrosion problems. It is also desirable
to maximize the azide content of the polymer through quantitative conversion of
the chloride functionality in the polymer to azide. To these ends, much work
has been carried out on processes to quantitatively and efficiently convert the
chloride functionality in the precursor to azide. See, for example, U.S. Pat.
Nos. 4,379,894; 4,486,351; 4,937,361; and 5,055,600.Azide substitution of up to 60 mole % of the chlorine atoms of a
poly(vinyl chloride) without gel formation has been reported. One of these thus
