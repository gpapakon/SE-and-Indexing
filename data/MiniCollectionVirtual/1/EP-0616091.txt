<ABSTRACT>
These Cement Blocks are lightweight and multicellular; they are 
provided with a slab (2) as a base for the grooves (3) on one 

horizontal side; pyramoidal/conoidal tongues (6) on the opposite 
horizontal side for their mechanical interlocking. Grooves (3) are 

deeper than pyramoidal/conoidal tongues (6) to allow, the application 
of shear connectors, and bonding mortar, when desirable. 
They are provided with tongues/grooves (5) (4) at their opposite 
vertical edges; with grooves (4) deeper than tongues (5) for mortar 

bonding to the perimetral contact with the bearing elements. 
These blocks can be erected in running bond; at an angle by 
super-imposition; 

they eliminate thermal bridge, and facilitate the installation 
of plumbing/electrical conduits, without excessive mortar. 

From their fabrik they allow substantial reductions to wall plasterworks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to blocks for masonry construction, which may be used for the
construction of load bearing elements, such as walls and beams, as well as for partitioning
masonry walls.A block for masonry construction, comprising two opposite longitudinal webs, extending
vertically and along a longitudinal direction and at least one transverse web, extending
vertically and in the transverse direction and connecting the two opposite longitudinal webs
is already known from WO 79/00198. This block has three pairs of faces, the faces of each
pair being opposite to each other, with the faces of the first of the three pairs of faces
extending horizontally, the faces of the second of the three pairs of faces being parallel to
the transverse web, and the faces of the third of the three pair of faces being parallel to the
longitudinal webs. The horizontally extending faces have first interlocking means for
interlocking blocks placed one on the top of the other, and at least one of second pair of
faces having second interlocking means for interlocking blocks being placed one next to
the other. The first interlocking means of the blocks disclosed in WO 79/00198 consists of
a single longitudinally disposed male element in one face and a complementary female
element in the opposite face, which extend across the breadth of the block. The blocks do
not provide interlocking means for corner and cross walls; and the configuration of
channels disposed on the first pair of faces, across the transverse webs, necessitate the use
of special production pallets and blockmakers.A further block for masonry construction is disclosed in document WO 92/09762. The
block disclosed in this document comprises tongues in its upper face, and a base slab with
grooves for receiving the tongues of the block located below. The shape of the tongues and
the corresponding grooves is such, so that there is a need of special inserts, in order to
effect positive interlocking of blocks. The block does not include means for interlocking
blocks placed one next to the other. The presence of the base slab, on which the grooves
are formed, does not allow the use of the blocks in case of use of vertical reinforcements.An object of the present invention is a block, with effective interlocking, and minimum
weight. The blocks are to be used for reinforced masonry construction, for the construction
of other load bearing elements, such as beams and for non-reinforced partitioning wall
construction. The object of the invention is achieved by the blocks

<CLAIMS>
Block for masonry construction, comprising two opposite longitudinal webs
(12,12A) extending, in use, vertically and along a longitudinal direction and at

least one transverse web (9,10,9A,9B,10A,10B), extending vertically and
in the transverse direction, the at least one transverse web connecting the

two opposite longitudinal webs (12,12A), whereby the block has three
pairs of faces, the faces of each pair being opposite to each other, the

faces (24,25) of the first of the three pairs of faces extending, in use, horizontally,
the faces (28,29) of the second of the three pairs of faces being parallel to

the transverse web, and the faces (26,27) of the third of the three pair of
faces being parallel to the longitudinal webs, the horizontally extending

faces having first interlocking means for interlocking blocks placed one on
the top of the other, and at least one of second pair of faces having

second interlocking means for interlocking blocks being placed one next to
the other,

wherein

the first interlocking means comprises alternating series of tongues
(6,6A,6B,6C14B,14C) and grooves (7,8,7A,7B,8A) on one of the first pair

of faces, and respective alternating series of grooves
(3,3B,3A,15B,3C,15C) and tongues (2,15,15A) on the other of the first

pair of faces, whereby
each of the said series of tongues and grooves of the first interlocking
means extend along the longitudinal direction,
each of the said tongues and grooves of the first interlocking means
comprise two longitudinally disposed faces,

those of which not forming the third pair of faces being, in use,
oblique with respect

to the horizontal,
the tongues and grooves on the one face of the first pair of faces, are of a
shape, which is complementary to the respective grooves and tongues on

the other face of the first pair of faces, in order to effect the interlocking of
blocks placed one on the top of the other.
Block 
according to claim 1
, whereby the block comprises a base slab,
with one of the two surfaces of the base slab coinciding with one face of

the first pair of faces, and whereby the grooves are formed on the said
face of the first pair of faces, and the webs being erected from the other of

the two surfaces of the base slab.
Block 
according to claim 1
, whereby the faces of the first pair of faces
are open faces, in order for the block to house vertically disposed

reinforcement
Block 
according to claim 1
, whereby the two opposite webs and the one
web connecting them, form a block with a U or I section.
Block 
according claim 1
, whereby the transverse webs connecting the
webs extending in the longitudinal direction, are recessed in their plane, in

order that the block receives longitudinal reinforcements.
Block 
according to claim 1
, whereby one or both faces of the second
pair of faces comprise vertically disposed alternating series of tongues

and grooves.
Block 
according to any of the claims 1 to 6
, whereby one face of the third pair of faces is
provided with an expanded polysterene slab for thermal insulation.
Block 
according to any of the claims 1 to 6
, whereby the grooves of
the first interlocking means are deeper then the tongues.
Block 
according to any of the claims 1 to 6,
 whereby the second
interlocking means comprises grooves and tongues, with one of the said

tongues projecting further than the other of the said tongues.
Block 
according to any of the claims 1 to 7,
 whereby the block
comprises third interlocking means (5) to interlock blocks placed at an

angle in the horizontal plane.
