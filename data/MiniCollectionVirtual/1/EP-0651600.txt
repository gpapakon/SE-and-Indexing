<ABSTRACT>
A method solder-coating a metallic pad (11) provided on a substrate, whereby 
at least the surface of the pad is provided with a deposit of solder paste, 

which paste comprises a suspension of metallic solder particles (13) which, 
when molten, have a surface energy lower than the critical surface energy 

of the metallic pad (11) but higher than the critical surface energy of the 
substrate surface outside the borders of the pad, whereby application of heat 

causes metallic solder particles (13) within the paste lying upon the pad 
to melt and fuse together into an essentially continuous metallic solder 

layer, whereas the metallic solder particles (13) within any paste lying upon 
the substrate surface outside the borders of the pad (11) do not thus fuse 

together into a layer but are instead deposited as mutually-isolated solder 
beads, which beads can be subsequently removed from the substrate surface 

after completion of the heating process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of solder-coating a metallic pad
provided on a substrate, whereby at least the surface of the pad is provided with a
deposit of solder paste, after which the substrate is at least partially subjected to a
heating process, which heating process induces localised precipitation of an essentially
continuous metallic solder layer out of the solder paste, which localised precipitation
occurs on the pad but not upon the substrate surface outside the borders of the pad,
subsequent to which any unwanted solder paste debris upon the substrate surface outside
the borders of the pad is removed.The invention also relates to a solder paste suitable for use in a method of
this type.Solder-coated metallic pads as hereabove referred to can be used as
fixation-bases for the legs of electrical components. Commonly used printed circuit
boards (and flexible printed circuit foils) comprise a substrate which is provided with a
plurality of metallic pads arranged according to definite patterns and selectively
interconnected via a network of conducting tracks. When the pads of such a circuit
board have been solder-coated in the above-described manner, appropriate electrical
components can be fixed to the board using a so-called "reflow" soldering process. This
process entails placement of the components at pre-determined locations on the board,
arrangement of their legs on the intended solder-coated metallic pads, and subsequent
application of heat. The solder layer between each leg and the corresponding pad then
melts, whereby the leg is soldered to the pad upon subsequent cooling. Further
information on reflow soldering is given by C. Lea in "A Scientific Guide to Surface
Mount Technology", Electrochemical Publications Limited (1988), ISBN 0 901150 22
3, in particular Chapter 7.Modern printed circuit boards (and foils) are often highly complex, and
frequently involve a very large packing-density of components. This means that the
metallic pads on such a board will often be present in very large numbers, and in very
close proximity to one another. In this respect, it is advantageous that the selective 
solder-coating method as hereabove described can efficiently coat all the pads (and none
of the substrate) in one go. This eliminates the need to provide solder on a tedious and
meticulous pad-by-pad basis.A solder-coating method as described in the opening paragraph, together
with a solder paste for use therein, are elucidated in un-examined Japanese Patent

<CLAIMS>
A method of solder-coating a metallic pad provided on a substrate,
whereby at least the surface of the pad is provided with a deposit of solder paste, after

which the substrate is at least partially subjected to a heating process, which heating
process induces localised precipitation of an essentially continuous metallic solder layer

out of the solder paste, which localised precipitation occurs on the pad but not upon the
substrate surface outside the borders of the pad, subsequent to which any unwanted

solder paste debris upon the substrate surface outside the borders of the pad is removed,
characterised in that a solder paste is used which comprises a suspension of metallic

solder particles whose concentration in the solder paste lies in the range 5-11 vol. % at Standard Temperature and Pressure, whose diameter lies in the range 10-40 µm, and which, when molten, have a surface energy lower than the critical
surface energy of the metallic pad but higher than the critical surface energy of the

substrate surface outside the borders of the pad, that the heating process causes the
metallic solder particles within the paste lying upon the pad to melt and fuse together

into an essentially continuous metallic solder layer, and that the metallic solder particles
within any paste lying upon the substrate surface outside the borders of the pad do not

fuse together into a layer but are instead deposited as mutually-isolated solder beads,
which beads can be subsequently removed from the substrate surface after completion of

the heating process.

whose concentration in the solder paste lies in the range 5-11 vol. % at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), and whose
average diameter lies in the range 10-40 µm.
A solder paste according to Claim 2, characterised in that the quantity of
metallic solder particles in the solder paste lies in the range 7-9 vol. % at STP, and that

the average diameter of the said particles lies in the range 20-30 µm.
A solder paste according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the
metallic solder particles are comprised of an alloy of Sn and Pb.
A solder paste according to Claim 2, 3 or 4, characterised in that the
solder paste comprises a flux solution. 
A solder paste according to any of the Claims 2-5, characterised in that
the solder paste comprises an activator mixture.
