recesses in opposed ends of the die cylinder in coaxial alignment 
with the axis of the die cylinder. The noses of the spindles

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rotary die apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1.A rotary die apparatus of this kind is known from EP-A- 0 234 559
and includes a die stand being composed of L-shaped members
which define a slot-like space between their legs. Carrier
blocks are fixed within this slot-like space and can be
removed together with the die cylinders when the die stand
is turned about 90Â° and one L-shaped member removed.For many years a pair of superimposed rotary dies
with blades on one or both cylinders have been used to cut
blanks from a thin web of material passing through the nip of
the dies. Each die is a cylinder with a pair of integral coaxial
mounting shafts projecting from its opposed ends. Typically
each shaft is journaled in a separate bearing block which is
slidably received in one of a pair of spaced apart uprights of
a die stand in which the dies are mounted in superimposed
relation for corotation for the blades to cut blanks from the
web. Drive gears are also mounted on one of the shafts of both
dies for corotating them in unison.These rotary dies are used in high speed mass
production machines. Therefore, to minimize down time when
changing dies for a different production run, usually the entire
die stand with the dies therein is removed from the production
machine and another die stand with different dies already therein
is installed in the machine. After removal the dies are
disassembled from the stand and the bearing blocks and gears 
are removed from the dies so that they can all be reassembled with
other dies for use in the production machine. Frequently the
bearings seize or jam on the shafts of the dies and cannot be
removed without destroying them. Therefore, usually the bearing
blocks are left mounted on the shafts for the life of the dies
which increases the cost of an already expensive rotary die
assembly.Alternatively, the dies can be changed while the die
stand is still in the production machine which further increases
the down time and hence the cost of lost production when changing
dies for a different run.The invention seeks to simplify changing of the die
cylinders in a die stand.The invention is defined in claim 1.A pair of rotary die cylinders each removably mountable
in a die stand by a pair of opposed arbor assemblies each with
a spindle journaled in a separate carrier block and drawn into
engagement with recesses in opposed ends of the die cylinder
in coaxial alignment therewith preferably by a draw bar extending
through the cylinder. Preferably, the
