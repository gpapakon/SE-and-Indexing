<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coupling device featuring threaded
members capable of rapid engagement and disengagement. Threaded coupling
devices, such as conventional nuts and bolts, have often proven ineffective in
highly specialized applications, for example, where speed is required, or where
extended rotating movement is undesirable. Efforts have been made to design
threaded coupling devices which may be assembled by rapid rectilinear
movement followed by final tightening by rotating one member relative to the
other. Just as there is a need to reduce the time and effort required to
assemble threaded coupling members, there also exists a need to simplify and
speed up the process of disengaging threaded coupling devices.US-A-4083393 describes a nut having a series of segments in a tapered
hole in a base part for sliding movement upwardly and downwardly to allow
insertion of a bolt. Each segment Includes a guide pin and an operation ring is
provided including can sections, each of the latter comprising a lower flat
surface, an upper flat surface and an inclined surface connecting said upper flat
surface with said lower flat surface, said lower and upper flat surfaces
extending substantially parallel to the bearing end face of said base part, said
cam sections engage said guide pins of said individual nut segments,
respectively, to control said nut segments, whereby said nut segments are
slidable upwardly on said inner surface of said tapered hole by rotation of said
operation ring as well as by lifting of said nut segments and said guide pins
therewith off said cam sections, respectively.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a
coupling device comprising:
a first member provided with threads;a second member having an opening therein lying along a longitudinal
axis into and out of which said first member may be inserted and removed;said second member including a first frustoconical surface and a second
frustoconical surface spaced from said first frustoconical surface;a plurality of threaded elements each having internal threads a first 
frustoconical bearing surface for sliding movement with respect to said first
frustoconical surface on said second member and a second frustoconical
bearing surface for sliding movement with respect to said second frustoconical
surface on said second membermeans mounting said threaded elements for movement outwardly with

means (32,34) mounting said threaded elements for movement
outwardly with respect to the longitudinal axis of said second member (12)
means normally urging said threaded elements inwardly with respect to
the longitudinal axis of the second member (12) whereby the inward sliding

movement of said first member (10) within said opening of said second
member (12) along said longitudinal axis causes said threaded elements (28) to

move radially outward by sliding action along said first and second
frustoconical surfaces of said second member and said first and second bearing

surfaces of said threaded elements after which brief rotating movement of said
first member (10) tightly moves said first member (10) into engagement with

said second member (12); and
means (24,58) moving said threaded elements (28) radially outward by
sliding cooperation between said first and second frustoconical surfaces (19,21)

and said first and second frustoconical bearing surfaces (55,56) thereby
permitting said first member (10) to be moved outwardly along said axis by

sliding movement.
A coupling device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said threaded 
elements (28) comprise a plurality of internally threaded elements having

frustoconical surfaces (52,55,56) mating with corresponding frustoconical
surfaces (52A,21,19) within the second member (12) thus permitting said

threaded elements (28) to move inwardly and outwardly in a radial direction
relative to the second member (12) and means biasing said threaded elements

(28) inwardly within said second member (12).
A coupling device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said means
moving said threaded elements (28) radially outward comprises a movably

mounted key element (24) associated with each of said threaded elements (28)
and provided with a sloping supporting surface (58), each of said threaded

elements (28) having a corresponding sloping supporting surface (56A), such
that movement of said key elements (24) causes sliding movement of said

threaded elements (28) along the juncture of said sloping supporting surfaces
(58,56A) moving said internally threaded elements (28) outwardly.
A coupling device as claimed in claim 3, wherein said means moving
said threaded elements (28) outwardly further comprises a cap (34) associated

with said second member (12), means (40) biasing said cap (34) away from
said second member (12), said threaded elements (28) being movable with said

cap (34) wherein said key elements (24) move with said second member (12),
such that movement of said cap (34) and said second member (28) towards

each other against the force of said biasing means (40) causes the
aforementioned movement of said key elements (24).
A coupling device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said second
member (12) comprises a cylinder (20) provided with a plurality of slots (22)

therein, a plurality of threaded elements (28), means mounting said elements to

including inclined supporting surfaces (56A), and wherein said means moving 
said threaded elements (28) outwardly permitting said first member (10) to

move outwardly along said axis by sliding movement comprises key elements
(24) extending through said slots (22) of said cylinder including sloping

supporting surfaces (58) engaging the supporting surfaces (56A) of said
threaded elements (28) and means moving said keys (24) upwardly causing

said threaded elements (28) to move outwardly towards said second position as
there is sliding movement between the supporting surfaces (58,56A) of the

keys (24) and the threaded elements (28).
A coupling device as claimed in claim 5, wherein said means
moving said key elements (24) comprises a sleeve (18), said key elements (24)

secured to said sleeve (18), a cap (34) connected to said cylinder (20), spring
means (40) urging said cap (34) and sleeve (18) away from each other, such
