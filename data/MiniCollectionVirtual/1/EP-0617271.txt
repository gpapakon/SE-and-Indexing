<ABSTRACT>
A heating sensor (2) capable of generating heat and 
measuring its own temperature is placed in a fluid and a 

thermometric sensor is placed in the fluid and inside a 
temperature boundary layer formed around the heating sensor 

upon heat generation therefrom. The temperature of the 
heating sensor (ϑ
W
) and the temperature of the fluid (ϑ
∞
) 
are measured. A relationship between the thermal 

conductivity of the fluid and a differential value between 
the temperature of the heating sensor and the temperature 

of the fluid is used to determine the thermal conductivity 
of the fluid. Then, the heating value of the heating 

sensor is adjustably increased so that the thermometric 
sensor is positioned outside the temperature boundary 

layer. The temperature of the heating sensor and the 
temperature of the fluid are measured. The relationship 

between kinematic viscosity of the fluid and a differential 
value between the temperature of the heating sensor and the 

temperature of the fluid is used to determine the kinematic 
viscosity of the fluid. Alternatively, a single heating 

sensor and a pair of the thermometric sensors are used, 
where one of the thermometric sensors is placed outside the 

temperature boundary layer, and the other thermometric 
sensor is placed inside the temperature boundary layer, or 

a pair of the heating sensors is used with a single 
thermometric sensor placed outside the temperature boundary 

layer formed around one of the heating sensors and inside 
the temperature boundary layer formed around the other 

heating sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
the simultaneous determination of thermal conductivity
and kinematic viscosity of a fluid using a sensor which
is capable of generating heat and measuring its own
temperature.In general, the measurement of thermal conductivity
and kinematic viscosity is essential to industrial
process management for handling general fluids.
It is well known to use a sensor which is capable of
generating heat and measuring its own temperature, such
that temperatures of the sensor itself and the temperature
of the fluid to be monitored are measured. Thus,
for example the state of a fluid is determined on the
basis of a characteristic kinematic viscosity value,
defined as a function of a differential temperature of
the sensor and fluid.Such thermal methods for measuring the change in
physical properties of a fluid are classified into two
general methods, i.e. the steady-state and the unsteady-state
methods. The unsteady-state method is
based upon the temperature of the heating sensor, or a 
differential temperature between the heating sensor and
the fluid, increasing with passage of time immediately
after the sensor initiates the generation of heat. The
so-called unsteady-state hot wire method, usually used
to measure thermal conductivity of fluid, is one example
of this unsteady-state method. On the other hand,
the so-called steady-state method is based upon the
phenomenon that, after a certain period of such heating
of the sensor in the unsteady-state, a temperature of
the heating sensor, or the differential temperature
between the heating sensor and the fluid, becomes
constant. It should be understood that, in response to
any change in the physical properties of the fluid,
such as viscosity, occurring in this steady state, the
temperature of the heating sensor will change to a
different level but will again stabilize at a constant
temperature.In the prior art, for example, the steady-state
method is used to obtain values of various physical
properties of a fluid on the basis of the respective
temperatures, or to determine the state of a fluid from
correlations between a change in temperature and a
change in viscosity or other physical properties, as
disclosed by the following documents:
