<ABSTRACT>
In a method of locating a monetary amount in a 
binary image, with a binary 1 representing a black pixel 

and a binary 0 representing a white pixel, an examining 
window (42) is positioned over a portion of the binary 

image and a list of objects is generated, with an object 
being defined as a set of contiguous black pixels. The 

objects are classified into parts such as characters, 
dots and commas, depending on predetermined criteria. 

The classified parts are then examined to determine 
whether or note they match a sequence which is indicative 

of a monetary amount. Then, the classified parts are 
examined to determine whether or not they conform to 

certain geometric criteria. Thus, a monetary amount is 
identified without effecting character recognition. The 

window (42) is moved to a next portion of data, and the 
process described is repeated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of locating a
monetary amount in a binary image of a document.In recent years, there has been an increased
effort towards processing information or data on
documents by using images of the documents instead of
using the documents themselves. The images are usually
generated by providing relative movement between the
document being scanned and a scanning device which
generates a plurality of picture elements or pixels in a
scanning line. Successive scanning lines of such pixels
generate an array of pixels for the area imaged. The
pixels are usually thresholded to generate binary data
with each pixel being a binary 1 or a binary 0, with the
binary 1 representing a black pixel for example, and the
binary 0 representing a white pixel. Such an array is
called a binary bit-mapped image.Images of business documents, for example, often
contain fields in which machine printed monetary amounts
are located. These fields may be isolated, or they may
form a part of lists or columns of the monetary amounts.
In those situations in which the location of the monetary
amounts within the bit-mapped image is not known, it is
usually difficult to find the monetary amounts.WO92/06447 shows a method wherein the dollar-sign is detected and the
associated courtesy amount is extracted. Subsequently, determination is
made whether the extracted courtesy amount is machine printed or
handwritten and character recognition processing is performed accordingly.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a simple and economical method of finding the
location of a monetary amount within a binary bit-mapped
image.Therefore, according to the present invention,
there is provided a method of locating a monetary amount
in a binary bit-mapped image of black and white pixels
representing a document, characterized by the steps of:
positioning a window of a predetermined size over a 
portion of said binary bit-mapped image; generating a
list of objects within said window with an object defined
as a set of contiguous black pixels; classifying said
objects into classified parts according to predetermined
size criteria; and examining said classified parts to
determine whether a sequence thereof matches at least one
sequence indicative of a monetary amount.It will be appreciated that a method according
to the invention has the advantage that a monetary amount
is located without having the need to depend on the
recognition of specific characters.One embodiment of the present invention will now
be described by

<CLAIMS>
A method of locating a monetary amount in a
binary bit-mapped image of black and white pixels

representing a document, characterized by the steps of:
positioning a window (42) of a predetermined size over a

portion of said binary bit-mapped image; generating a
list of objects within said window (42) with an object

defined as a set of contiguous black pixels; classifying
said objects into classified parts according to

predetermined size criteria; and examining said
classified parts to determine whether a sequence thereof

matches at least one predetermined sequence indicative of a monetary
amount.
A method according to claim 1, characterized
by the step of: if a match is found in said examining

step, determining whether or not the vertical heights of
the classified parts conform to predetermined criteria.
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 said determining step includes measuring the
absolute variance by which the individual tops and

bottoms of the classified parts vary from average values,
with respect to a coordinate position within said window

(42).
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 said at least one predetermined
sequence indicative of a monetary amount includes the

sequence: character, dot, character, character.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 said at least one predetermined
sequence indicative of a monetary amount includes the

sequence: character, gap, character, character.
A method according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 said positioning
step includes the step of dimensioning said window (42) 

so that it is unlikely to accommodate more than one
monetary amount.
