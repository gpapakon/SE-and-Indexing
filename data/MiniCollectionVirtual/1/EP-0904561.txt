<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and device for producing at least three light bundles (64, 66, 90) of differing wavelengths for a color display, wherein one of the light bundles (66) has the longest wavelength and another light bundle (64) has the shortest wavelength obtained using an OPO (56) and other non-linear optical components from a signal and/or idler beam (58, 60) of said OPO (56) and/or of a primary light bundle (5), from which a beam (52) which excites the OPO (56) is also derived. The invention provides for separation of at least one partial light bundle (52) from the primary light bundle (50) to excite the OPO (56). Both the light bundle (64) with the longest wavelength and the light bundle (66) with the shortest wavelength are obtained from the signal and/or idler beam (58, 60) of the OPO (56) by means of frequency upconversion and/or frequency mixing with another partial light bundle of the primary light bundle (50), excluding components other than the ones with the longest and shortest wavelengths, to display the light bundles (90) produced.

Process for generating a red, a green and a blue light bundle (64, 66, 90), especially for
displaying color images, of which the red and the blue light bundles (64, 66) are obtained with

from a primary light bundle (92) or part thereof, and at least one partial light bundle (52) being
separated from the primary light bundle (50) for exciting the OPO (56) such that a signal beam

(58) and an idler beam (60) are generated, wherein the red light bundle (64) is obtained by
frequency mixing from the signal beam (58) and from another partial light bundle (54) of the
