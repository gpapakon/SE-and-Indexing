<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a coating composition for the 
preparation of a CF sheet (i.e. a receiving sheet) of a 

carbonless paper copying system comprising a CF sheet 
and a CB sheet (i.e. a donating sheet). The coating 

composition comprises a colour developer and an 
extender, wherein the extender comprises a particulate 

inorganic material which has been modified by treatment 
with a treating agent which has (i) a non-polar 

hydrophobic portion comprising at least one hydrocarbon 
group having a chain length of from 8 to 30 carbon 

atoms and (ii) a polar portion which is capable of 
binding with sites on the surface of the pigment 

particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to colour developer
compositions used to develop images in pressure-sensitive
carbonless paper copying systems. This
invention also relates to colour developer sheets for
carbonless paper copying systems and to multiple
carbonless paper copying systems comprising such colour
developer sheets.Pressure-sensitive carbonless paper copying
systems have captured a very large market on account of
their convenience compared with carbon paper copying.
Carbonless paper copying systems comprise a multiple
set made up of a matched pair, or a plurality of
matched pairs, of sheets, generally of paper, of which
one is a donating sheet and the other is a receiving
sheet. When written upon, the donating sheet is
pressed into contact with the receiving sheet, and an
image substantially identical to the writing develops
on the receiving sheet.This image development is brought about by the
contact of a colourless dye precursor, i.e. a colour
former, present on the donating sheet with a colour
developer present on the receiving sheet. Generally, a
solution of the colour former in a solvent is
encapsulated in microcapsules and coated on to the back
face of the donating sheet (the CB sheet), which will
generally have an uncoated front face. Typical colour
formers, often termed "leuco dyes", are, for example,
triphenylmethanes (such as Crystal violet lactone),
xanthenes (such as N-102 fluoran) and thiazines (such
as benzoyl leucomethylene blue). The colour developer
is generally coated on the front face of the receiving
sheet (the CF sheet). When the CB and CF sheets are
placed in contiguous relationship with the colour
developer adjacent to the colour former and pressure, 
such as from a writing instrument, typewriter or the
like, is applied, the microcapsules are crushed and
the released colour former solution is adsorbed onto
the CF sheet where it contacts the colour developer.
The image on the CF sheet develops from a chemical
transformation of the colour former to a coloured form,
caused by the colour developer. In general, this
chemical transformation entails an acid-base type
reaction wherein the colour former changes from an
uncharged colourless state to a positively charged
coloured state.Alternatively, the colour former microcapsules and
the colour developer can be coated onto the same sheet,
or the colour developer can be on the CB sheet and the
colour former microcapsules can be on the CF sheet.
For convenience, hereinafter, "CB sheet" refers to a
sheet, generally a paper sheet, coated with

comprises a colour developer and an
extender, of an extender that comprises a particulate

inorganic material which has been modified by treatment,
prior to incorporation into the composition,

with a treating agent which has (i) a non-polar

group having a chain length of from 8 to 30 carbon
atoms and (ii) a polar portion which is capable of

binding with sites on the surface of the
particulate inorganic material.
The use according to claim 1, wherein the coating composition
comprises from 40 to 98% by weight of the extender and

from 2 to 60% by weight of the colour developer, based

composition

further comprises a dispersing agent.

phosphoric acid, a water soluble salt of a polysilicic
acid, a water soluble salt of a poly (acrylic acid) or

a poly (methacrylic acid), or a water soluble salt of
an alkyl sulphate or an alkyl sulphonate wherein the

alkyl group has a chain length of from 8 to 20 carbon 
atoms.
The use according to claim 6 or 7, wherein the coating composition
comprises from 0.05 to 2.0% by weight of dispersing

agent based on the total weight of the extender and the
colour developer.
The use according to any of
claims 1 to 8, wherein the particulate inorganic

material is kaolin or china clay, natural or synthetic
aluminium or calcium sulphate, natural or precipitated

calcium carbonate, satin white, natural or synthetic
calcium sulphate, or talc.

claims 1 to 9, wherein the treating agent is a primary,

secondary or tertiary amine, a quaternary ammonium
compound, or a fatty acid.
The use according to any of
claims 1 to 10, wherein the colour developer is an acid-treated

clay, a phenolic resin, or a monomeric phenol.
