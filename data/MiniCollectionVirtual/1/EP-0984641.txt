<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a mobile terminal for
communicating with a base station in a packet radio services

network. The terminal has a processor for determining one
of a plurality of channels for communication between the

mobile terminal and the base station; for digitally coding
speech to provide speech information; for assembling speech

information into speech packets; and for generating channel
allocation requests for a channel in which to send speech

packets. A radio transmitter is provided for transmitting
the requests and the packets to a base station in the

network. A radio receiver receives identities of channels
allocated by the base station for the mobile terminal to

transmit on. The processor is responsive to each received
channel allocation to determine that packets are sent on

the allocated channel.
In the GPRS since a channel is released when there
is no packet to transmit, higher traffic levels can be

obtained using the same number of radio channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packet radio services
networks.Standards are being defined for a general packet
radio services network (GPRS).The invention is based on the recognition that if
suitably designed a packet services network could carry
speech.To this end, in accordance with the invention there
is provided a mobile terminal for communicating with a base
station in a packet radio services network, said terminal
including a processor for determining one of a plurality of
channels for communication between the mobile terminal and
the base station; for digitally coding speech to provide
speech information; for assembling speech information into
speech packets; and for generating channel allocation
requests for a channel in which to send speech packets; a
radio transmitter for transmitting the requests and the
packets to a base station in the network; and a radio
receiver for receiving identities of channels allocated by
the base station for the mobile terminal to transmit on,
said processor being responsive to each received channel
allocation to determine that packets are sent on the
allocated channel.In the GPRS since a channel is released when there 
is no packet to transmit, higher traffic levels can be
obtained using the same number of radio channels.Preferably, if a request to send is not granted, the
processor is arranged to discard speech information until a
further request is granted. As speech is highly time
sensitive, it is better to discard the information than to
send the information delayed. The discard produces clipping
which, as long as it is not too frequent, is tolerable by
the user.The processor is preferably arranged so that when a
request to send is not granted, a further request is delayed
by a predetermined period.The delay is preferably increased if successive
requests are not granted.Following a predetermined maximum delay, the delay
is reduced.The processor is preferably arranged to implement a
layered protocol in which each packet is given a header in a
subnetwork dependent convergence protocol layer (SDNDCP).Because of the time sensitive nature of speech the
header is preferably a RTP/VDP/IP header.The mobile terminal preferably includes a voice
activity detector, and the processor is preferably
responsive to detection of voice activity by the voice
activity detector, to generate a request for a channel
allocation in which to send voice packets, and on receipt
of a channel identity, to send the an address header 
uncompressed on that channel once and subsequently to send
packe

A mobile terminal for communicating with a
base station in a packet radio services network, said

terminal including a processor for determining one of a
plurality of channels for communication between the mobile

terminal and the base station; for digitally coding speech
to provide speech information; and for assembling speech

information into speech packets; for generating channel
allocation requests in which to send speech packets; a radio

transmitter for transmitting the requests and the packets to
a base station in the network; and a radio receiver for

receiving identities of channels allocated by the base
station for the mobile terminal to transmit on, said

processor being responsive to each received channel
allocation to determine that packets are sent on the

allocated channel.
A mobile terminal as claimed in claim 1,
wherein if a request to send is not granted, the processor

is arranged to discard speech information until a further
request is granted.
A mobile terminal as claimed in claim 2,
wherein the processor is arranged so that when a request to

send is not granted, a further request is delayed by a
predetermined period.
A mobile terminal as claimed in claim 3,
wherein the delay is increased if successive requests are

not granted.
A mobile terminal as claimed in claim 4,
wherein following a predetermined maximum delay, the delay

is reduced.
A mobile terminal as claimed in any
preceding claim, wherein the processor is arranged to

implement a layered protocol, and wherein each packet is

processor is responsive to detection of voice activity by
the voice activity detector, to generate a request for a

channel allocation in which to send voice packets, and on
receipt of a channel identity, to send am address header

destination address on the identified channel, until the
voice activity detector detects no voice activity.
