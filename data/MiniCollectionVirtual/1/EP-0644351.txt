<ABSTRACT>
An air spring has a pair of axially spaced end 
members and an intervening elastomeric flexible sleeve 

extending therebetween which forms a fluid pressure chamber. 
A pair of recesses are formed on an inner surface of an 

annular clamp ring which cooperate with a pair of 
corresponding annular projections formed on an outer surface 

of each of the end members to positionally locate the ring on 
the end member and to form a pair of pinch areas sealingly 

clamping the sleeve therebetween. Expansion grooves are 
formed between the projections and on opposite sides thereof 

to receive portions of the sleeve therein to form three 
elastomeric bead-like members, and to change the direction of 

reinforcing cords within the sleeve. The clamp ring seats 
upon a shoulder of each of the end members to reduce movement 

of the clamp ring during operation of the air spring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to clamping means and more 
particularly to the clamping means adapted to affix a 
resilient elastomeric sleeve member to a relatively rigid 
piston member or end cap of an air spring. Specifically, the 
invention relates to a clamp ring assembly employing a 
clamping ring having at least a pair of recesses on the inner 
diameter thereof which coact with a corresponding member of 
projections on the outer diameter of the piston member or end 
cap to positionally locate the clamping ring on the piston 
member and to effectively seal the open end of the elastomeric 
sleeve therebetween. Pneumatic springs commonly referred to as air 
springs, have been used for many applications, including motor 
vehicles, for a number of years to provide cushioning between 
moveable parts of the vehicle, primarily to absorb shock loads 
impressed on the vehicle axles by the wheels striking an 
object in the road or falling into a depression. The air 
spring usually consists of a flexible rubber sleeve or bellows 
containing a supply of compressible fluid and has one or more 
pistons movable with respect to the flexible sleeve. The 
piston causes compression and expansion of the fluid within 
the sleeve as the sleeve compresses and expands as the vehicle 
experiences the road shock. The spring sleeve is formed of 
a flexible elastomeric material containing reinforcing cords, 
and permits the piston to move axially with respect to another 
piston or end cap secured within open ends of the sleeve.  
 The open ends of the sleeves are sealingly connected 
to the piston and/or opposite end cap, and the integrity of 
this connection is always one of the important and major 
aspects in producing an efficient and maintenance free air 
spring. Another problem with existing air springs, and in 
particular, the clamp ring therefore, is that the clamp ring 
will move in its clamped position under dynamic air spring 
conditions causing movement of the clamped elastomeric 
material therebetween tending to loosen the sealing engagement 
and deteriorating the clamp integrity and causing ultimate air 
spring leakage and failure. This ring movement is especially 
critical during the jounce or collapsing stroke. Another problem with existing air springs and the 
clamping of the elastomeric sleeve ends to the piston member 
and/or end cap is to secure a sufficiently tight seal to be 
able to withstand high fluid pressures contained in the fluid 
chamber without premature leakage or bursting even upon 
experiencing severe

<CLAIMS>
In an air spring (1) having a pair of end 
members (2,3) adapted to be mounted at generally axially 

spaced locations, a flexible sleeve (8) formed of an 
elastomeric material containing reinforcing cords (9) and 

having open ends sealingly engaged with the end members 
forming a fluid chamber (18) therebetween, an annular axially 

extending sealing surface (10,45) formed on at least one of 
said end members, an annular clamp ring (32,55) having an 

axially extending inner clamping surface (35) located 
concentrically with respect to the annular sealing surface of 

said one end member for sealingly clamping one end of the 
flexible sleeve therebetween, and a radially outwardly 

extending annular shoulder (12,53) formed at one end of the 
annular sealing surface of said one end member for abutting 

the clamp ring to restrict movement of said clamp ring in the 
axial direction during operation of the air spring; 

characterized in that the annular sealing surface (10,45) is 
formed with a pair of axially spaced annular projections 

(19,20,46,47) extending radially outwardly and that the clamp 
ring (32,55) is formed with a pair of recesses (33,34) each 

recess cooperating with a respective one of the annular 
projections to positionally locate said ring with respect to 

said one end member and for providing a pair of axially spaced 
pinch areas (42,43) for clamping the flexible sleeve 

therebetween and for changing the direction of travel of the 
reinforcing cords in the clamped sleeve end; and that at least 

three grooves (23,26,27,48,49,50) are formed in the sealing 
surface of said one end member providing expansion zones for 

receiving elastomeric material of the sleeve therein, one of 
said grooves (23,48) being intermediate the pair of 

projections with the other two grooves (26,27,49,50) being 
located on other sides of said projections.  

 
The air spring according to Claim 1 
characterized in that the diameters of the two annular 

projections (19,20,46,47) are equal. 
The air spring according to Claim 1 
characterized in that the annular projections terminate in 

outer ends (21,23) which are spaced radially from bottom 
surfaces of the concave recesses (33,34) a distance within the 

range of 40% and 60% of the thickness of the flexible sleeve. 
The air spring according to Claim 3 
characterized in that the outer ends (21,23) of the annular 

projections (19,20,46,47) are convexely curved. 
The air spring according to Claim 1 
characterized in that each of the expansion grooves extends 

radially inwardly into the clamp ring (32,55) generally the 
same distance as the other groove. 
The air spring according to Claim 1 
characterized in that the clamp ring recesses (33,34) are 

concavely curved. 
The air spring according to Claim 1 
characterized in that an end of the end member sealing surface 

(10,45) opposite of the annular shoulder, terminates in an 
annular stepped surface, and that said annular stepped surface 

has first (15,54) and second (16,51) annular portions, said 
first portion (15,54) having a diameter generally equal to the 

diameter of the pair of annular projections. 
The air spring according to Claim 7 
characterized in that the second portion of the annular 

stepped surface forms a pinch area (B,C) with an inner edge 
of the clamp ring.  

 
The air spring according to Claim 1 
characterized in that the two recesses (33,34) are separated 

by an annular generally flat surface (40) which forms part of 
the axially extending inner clamping surface (35) of the clamp 

ring, said flat surface being substantially of the same 
diameter as said axially extending inner surface of the clamp 

ring. 
The air spring according to Claim 1 
characterized in that said one end member is a piston (3) 

having a body; the annular shoulder (12) terminates into the 

piston body by a curved corner (13); and the clamp ring (32) 
has an outer annular axially extending surface (38) which 

generally aligns with said curved corner of the body to 
provide a substantially continuous surface on which the 

flexible sleeve may roll during operation of the air spring.
