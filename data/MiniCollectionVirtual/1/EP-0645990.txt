An application system for application of bone cement from
a receptacle (5) into a bone cavity, including an outlet part

(16) being adapted to said receptacle and with an elongated
application part, characterized in that there is no shoulder

along the inner surface of the components of said application
system, and in that said application part being a one-piece

collapsible tube or snorkel (4) which is attached to the
outside of said outlet part (16) and wherein its length and

material are chosen so that said tube or snorkel (4) deforms
and expands through said bone cement being input during

application and moves forward during subsequent contraction so
that said tube or snorkel (40) filled with said applied bone

cement is substantially filling said bone cavity in the
unfolded condition.
The application system of claim 1 which is formed in more
or more parts, preferably in two parts.
The application system of claim 1 or 2, wherein said
outlet part being formed so that it is adapted to the outlet

opening of said receptacle along the inner surfaces and
wherein said outlet part preferably including a funnel-shaped

portion.
The application system of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
length of said collapsible tube or snorkel in its unfolded

condition is about 3 to 25 cm, preferably 5 to 20 cm, and
wherein said collapsible snorkel or tube is preferably formed

so that it can easily be inserted into the bone cavity to be
filled by said application system and is adapted to be removed

after filling said bone cavity. 
The application system of claims 1 to 4, including a cap
with one or m
ore parts, which can be put on said receptacle
for example by a bayonet joint or a screw closure so that the

inner surfaces of said cap and said receptacle fit together
without a shoulder, wherein said cap is preferably formed so

that it is also adapted to extend a not dynamically balanced
outlet opening without shoulder, for example a transversal

outlet opening of said receptacle, and/or wherein the
adjustment of the position of said cap is reproducible with

regard to said receptacle for example by joining the bayonet
or adapting the threads of said screw closure.
The application system of claim 5, wherein said cap is
formed in two parts and includes said collapsible snorkel or

tube, and wherein the inner diameter of the main part of said
cap and of said snorkel or tube is substantially the same at

the junction.
The application system of claims 1 to 6, wherein said
snorkel or tube is attached so that it is held at said cap by

at least one sharp outer profile being undercut and prevented
from sliding back, and/or wherein said collapsible snorkel or

tube is attached and secured by means of a thread or a tube
clamp at said outlet part.
The application system of claims 1 to 7, wherein said
snorkel or tube may be folded star-shaped or otherwise,

wherein said collapsible snorkel or tube is preferably easier
to unfold at its free end in comparison to other end being at

or close to said outlet part.
The application system of claims 1 to 8, wherein the
material is chosen from a sterilisable plastic, e.g. TPX, 

rubber or silicone, polycarbonate or a similar material, metal
or glass, and/or wherein the collapsible snorkel or tube can

be made of a smooth, resilient material or a composite which
can perform a windkessel-function, e.g.

polytetrafluoroethylene.
The application system of claims 1 to 9, wherein said bone
cement includes polymethylmethacrylate bone cement or an

anorganic cement mass.
