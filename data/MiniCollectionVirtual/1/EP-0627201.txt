<ABSTRACT>
The assembled endoprosthesis is in a radially tensioned state in a cylindrical space (14) and lies with a proximal region (A) in a first external catheter (3) and with a distal region (B) in a second external catheter (30). In order to release the endoprosthesis (1), for example in a vessel (11), the second external catheter (30) is initially retracted. The endoprosthesis (1) is then still retained in the first external catheter (3) by friction and can be folded back by advancing the second external catheter (30), and can thus be repositioned. The endoprosthesis (1) is finally released by retracting the first external catheter (3). Since the friction is divided up over at least two external catheters (3, 30) it is also possible to release endoprostheses (1) which have a high friction on the outside to the external catheter, for example due to a coating, high expansion force or large length.

Device for releasing a self-expanding
endoprosthesis (1), comprising a flexible elongated outer

catheter (3) having a distal end and a proximal end and
comprising a flexible elongated inner catheter (6) arranged

coaxially with respect to the outer catheter (3), said inner
catheter having at a distal end a tip (7) and, proximal to

the latter, means (14) for receiving the endoprosthesis (1),
whereby the outer catheter (3) is capable of being pushed in

its longitudinal direction via the means (14) in order to
fix the endoprosthesis (1) and is capable of being retracted

in order to release said endoprosthesis, characterised in
that on the outer catheter (3) there is arranged, coaxially

with respect to the latter, a second outer catheter (30)
which is capable of being applied with a distal orifice

(30b) onto the tip (7), said second outer catheter being
displaceable on the first outer catheter (3) in the

longitudinal direction, whereby the stated tip (7) limits
the capacity of the second outer catheter (30) for axial

displacement relative to the first outer catheter (3) in the
distal direction, in that when an endoprosthesis (1) is

inserted the second outer catheter (30) protrudes distally
beyond the first outer catheter (3) with a distal end (30b)

in such a manner that the endoprosthesis (1) is tightened
with a distal region (B) against an inner side (31) of the

second outer catheter (30) and with a proximal region (A)
against an inner side of the first outer prosthesis (3) and

in order to release the endoprosthesis (1) the second outer
catheter (30) and the first outer catheter (3) on the inner

catheter (6) are capable of being retracted from the
endoprosthesis (1).
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the two outer catheters (3, 30) are
 capable of being
retracted from the endoprosthesis (1) independently of one

another. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the second outer catheter (30) has a tubular, flexible

length of hose (30a), on which a connecting and sealing
piece (32) is secured proximally which seals the second

outer catheter (30) in relation to the first outer catheter
(3) and is displaceable on the latter.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the second outer catheter (30)

terminates at its distal end with a circular orifice (30b).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the tip (7) of the inner catheter (6)

has a shoulder (5) which protrudes laterally beyond the
second outer catheter (30) at the distal end thereof.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the second outer catheter (30) has a

smooth inner side at least at its distal end.
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 6,
characterised in that the length of hose (30a) is produced

from polytetrafluoroethylene or a synthetic material that
slides similarly well.
Device according to one of Claims 3 to 7,
characterised in that the wall thickness of the length of

hose (30a) pertaining to the second outer catheter (30)
corresponds substantially to the wall thickness of a length

of hose pertaining to the first outer catheter (3).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the inner catheter (6) has on its

outer side a circular cylindrical recess (14) for receiving
the endoprosthesis (1). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the inner catheter (6) has an

intermediate piece (9) which connects the tip (7) to a
distally arranged length of tubing (10) and which has an

outside diameter (F) smaller than an outside diameter (C) of
the length of tubing (10).
