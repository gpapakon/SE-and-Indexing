<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pedal assembly, especially for actuating the clutch of a motor vehicle, having a pedal (1) which is supported so as to be pivotable about a constructionally-fixed bearing axis (2) and a biased leaf-spring arrangement (3), acting as an over-centre spring, which is supported with its one end on the pedal (1) and with its other end on a constructionally-fixed counter bearing (4). According to the invention, the leaf-spring arrangement is designed as a biased flat springleaf (3) which is loaded so as to buckle and which is supported in each case in an articulated manner with its one free end on the constructionally-fixed counter bearing (4) and with its other free end on a counter bearing (5) on the pedal side.

Pedal assembly, in particular for actuating the clutch of a motor vehicle, 
comprising a pedal (1) mounted in such a manner as to pivot about a 

bodywork-fixed bearing axis (2) and further comprising a biassed leaf spring 
arrangement (3) which is supported at one end on the pedal (1) and at the 

other end on a bodywork-fixed counter bearing (4) and functions as a top 
dead centre spring and which leaf spring arrangement is formed as a 

biassed flat spring leaf (3) which is loaded on bending and is supported in 
each case in an articulated manner with one free end on the bodywork-fixed 

counter bearing (4) and with its other free end on a pedal-side counter 
bearing (5), characterised in that the two counter bearings (4, 5) comprise 

in each case convex cylindrical surfaces (6, 7) which are aligned 
approximately in parallel with the bearing axis (2) for the purpose of directly 

supporting the biassed spring leaf (3) and that concave bearing surfaces (8, 
9) are integrated at both fee ends of the spring leaf (3) and correspond to the 

said convex cylindrical surfaces (6, 7) respectively. 
Pedal assembly, in particular for actuating the clutch of a motor vehicle, 
comprising a pedal (1) mounted in such a manner as to pivot about a 

bodywork-fixed bearing axis (2) and further comprising a biassed leaf spring 
arrangement (3) which is supported at one end on the pedal (1) and at the 

other end on a bodywork-fixed counter bearing (4) and functions as a top 
dead centre spring and which leaf spring arrangement is formed as a 

biassed flat spring leaf (3) which is loaded on bending and is supported in 
each case in an articulated manner with one free end on the bodywork-fixed 

counter bearing (4) and with its other free end on a pedal-side counter 
bearing (5), characterised in that the two counter bearings (4, 5) comprise 

in each case concave bearing surfaces (14, 15) which are aligned 
approximately in parallel with the bearing axis (2) for the purpose of directly 

supporting the biassed spring leaf (3), wherein the two free ends of the 
spring leaf (3) themselves are curved to form convex cylindrical bearing 

surfaces (16, 17), which correspond to the concave bearing surfaces.  
 
Pedal assembly according to claim 2 characterised in that the free ends of 
the spring leaf (3) support cylindrical synthetic material rollers (18, 19) which 

correspond to the concave bearing surfaces (14, 15). 
Pedal assembly according to claim 3 characterised in that the synthetic 
material rollers are slotted in a longitudinal manner and are placed on the 

free ends of the spring leaf (3). 
Pedal assembly according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that at least one of the two counter bearings (4, 5) comprises lateral bearing 

cheeks (10) to prevent the spring leaf (3) from sliding sidewards or 
deflecting.
