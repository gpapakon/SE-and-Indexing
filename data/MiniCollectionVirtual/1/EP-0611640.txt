<ABSTRACT>
In a granular material comprising fibre-reinforced thermoplastics, a multiplicity of individual filaments of the reinforcing fibres (for example glass) are arranged in parallel in a matrix of thermoplastic material (for example polypropylene). The fibre length corresponds to the granule length and is in the range from 3 mm to 8 mm. The melt viscosity of the thermoplastic material is greater than 100 Pa.s, the diameter of the granules (measured perpendicular to the fibre direction) is from 1.7 to 5 mm, and the diameter:length ratio of the granules is from 0.4 to 1.66.

material, in which a multiplicity of individual 

filaments of the reinforcing fiber are arranged in 
parallel in a matrix of the thermoplastic material, 

the fiber length corresponds to the granule length 
and is in the range from 3 mm to 8 mm, wherein the 

melt viscosity of the thermoplastic material is 
above 100 Pa.s, the diameter of the granule measured 

perpendicular to the fiber direction is 1.7 to 5 mm 
and the ratio diameter:length of the granule is 0.4 

to 1.66. 
The granule as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reinforcing 
fibers consist of glass. 
The granule as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
thermoplastic material consists of polypropylene. 
The granule as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
proportion of reinforcing fibers in the granule is 

3 to 67 % by volume.
