<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention in the first place relates to a
squeegee assembly in particular intended for coating
substantially cylindrical objects with a liquid or pasty
material, at least comprising an annular squeegee with an
outer mounting edge and an inner levelling edge.Such a squeegee assembly is known from the prior art
and is frequently used in coating devices, and also
manually in specially designed manual coating devices in
order to provide substantially cylindrical objects with a
coating of material. Such a squeegee assembly is for
example used for coating a seamless metal rotary screen
printing cylinder, which is, for example, a nickel cylinder
having a wall thickness of between 50 - 500 microns and
comprising 20 - 200 holes per running cm, with a lacquer.
After such a screen printing cylinder has been coated, that
is to say the lacquer coating on the dams between the holes
has a specific layer thickness and a suitable depth of
penetration into the holes, said lacquer coating is
partially removed in accordance with a pattern, while the
remaining areas are hardened. Such a screen printing
cylinder is then ready for screen printing, in which case a
dye is pressed on a substrate to be printed through the
open holes by means of an infernal straight squeegee, as
known from the prior art.EP-A-0 338 612 discloses a squeegee assembly with an
annular squeegee for coating rotary screen printing
stencils with a photosensitive coating.For the purpose of clarity in the following
description reference will be made exclusively to the
coating of a rotary screen printing cylinder with a
lacquer. The device may, however, also be used for a large
number of other applications, such as for example, painting
or otherwise coating substantially cylindrical objects,
like tubes or even substantially solid objects.The coating of cylindrical objects with the aid of
known squeegee assemblies has a number of important 
disadvantages. The accuracy with which such squeegee
assembly has to be displaced along the object to be coated 
is required to be very high, as substantial differences in
layer thickness and penetration depth of the material to be
applied occur in the case of even the smallest eccentricity
between the squeegee and the object. Furthermore the choice
of the shape of the squeegee and its rigidity as well as
the choice of the lacquer are relatively complicated and
dependent on many factors. The layer thickness and
penetration depth of the material to be applied to a screen
printing cylinder are dependent on the
