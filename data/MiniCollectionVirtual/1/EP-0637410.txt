<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to direct current motors 
and more particularly to multi-armature motors having 
dual coils between parallel pole pieces establishing 
magnetic circuits for exciting two or more armatures. Conventional direct current motors usually 
comprise a housing journalling an armature with sectional 
field coils or stator windings contained by the housing 
which substantially surround the armature to provide a 
magnetic circuit for exciting the armature. In this type of design only one armature is 
operated by each group of stators or field windings 
resulting in inefficient utilization of the various 
circuits established and thus limiting the potential of 
the magnetic circuit easily established by direct current 
through coils interposed between magnetizable pole 
pieces. The most pertinent patent is believed to be 
United States Patent No. 3,651,355 issued to Mason on 
March 21, 1972 for MULTIPLE ARMATURE MOTORS. This patent 
discloses the basic features of the motors of this 
invention, but fails to disclose all the advantages of 
magnetic flux selectively arranged to obtain the desired 
torque and speed of the respective armatures with 
relation to an efficient means of input amperage which is 
disclosed by this invention. Background art cited in the above named patent 
comprises United States Patent No. 2,853,637 issued 
September 23, 1958 to Ishikawa for FRACTIONAL DIRECT  
 
CURRENT TORQUE MOTOR, United States Patent No. 3,471,729 
issued October 7, 1969 to Latta, et al for PLURAL MOTOR 
ASSEMBLY, and United States Patent No. 3,510,707 issued 
May 5, 1970 to Stone, et al for MOTOR AND METHOD OF 
ASSEMBLING. The Ishikawa Patent No. *67 discloses a constant 
torque direct current motor in which the improvement 
resides in reducing the current and the torque of the 
motor by increasing the resistance of the motor for 
driving a clock in which the field magnet can be either a 
permanent or electromagnet. Both the Latta, et al *729, 
and Stone, et al *707 disclose sheet metal housing 
members formed to provide arcuate armature surrounding 
sections interconnected by parallel webs and housing end 
projections housing armatures and permanent magnet for 
energizing the armatures. Such an enclosure by the 
counter acting magnetic flux results in excessive heat 
buildup in the respective armature enclosure. The number of rotors which may be interposed 
between and operated by the magnetic flux of two pole 
pieces established by one or more coils from a single 
direct current source is almost
