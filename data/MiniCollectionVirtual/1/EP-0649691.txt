<ABSTRACT>
A stereolithography machine is employed to solidify a pattern (11) 
including a series of stacked grids (8,10) forming the pattern having 

an outer skin 
and inner labyrinth and any number of gates. The hollow pattern (11) is 

mounted on a central sprue (62) through runners (60) at the gate (16) 
of the pattern. The 

pattern (11) is dipped in ceramic slurry (64) and sifted in a refractor 
grain in order to 

coat the hollow pattern. The hollow pattern is melted to form a mold.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to investment casting techniques, and
more particularly, to
an investment
pattern adapted to be used in the production of castings and
to a method for fabrication of castings.The casting industry has long used heat-disposable solid patterns in
the making of metal objects. The process of investment casting is historically
known as the "lost wax" process. This process is performed by supplying a
wax pattern of the item to be cast. A geometric cavity results after the solid
pattern is encapsulated in ceramic and then removed by melting of the wax
of the pattern. The cavity is filled with metal or other casting material which
then takes the exact shape of the original pattern. Other pattern materials
have been tried such as wood, foam, and plastic, but these types of pattern
materials are more difficult to remove by heating than the wax. A
requirement of any casting method is that the ceramic encapsulant or mold
remains intact without cracking during the pattern melt or burn-out.Stereolithography, or rapid prototyping, enables construction of plastic
patterns in a short time period and without tooling. The stereolithography
patterns are made of polymer which is solidified on the exterior of the
pattern by scanning a UV (ultraviolet) laser according to a three dimensional
data in a computer database. The pattern is produced one layer at a time by
the laser. The polymer remains liquid in the interior of the pattern until the
pattern is further cured, for example by curing the pattern in a UV oven. 
Solid patterns produced in this manner have been used in the casting process
with great difficulty, primarily due to the high burn-out temperatures of
resin and high thermal expansion of the pattern. The ceramic shell typically
cracks or breaks as stereolithography patterns expand outward during the
burn-out phase. The cracking or breaking is a result of weak or incomplete
portion of the pattern being produced one layer at a time. This cracking or
breaking normally occurs at the position where two layers are joined
together. In addition, the polymer does not burn cleanly or completely,
leaving the end product casting contaminated or of low quality due to the ash
of the burned polymer.WO-A-9001727 discloses an investment pattern as mentioned
in the beginning. The pattern is a cross-linked polymeric
matrix of a radiation-cured ethylenically unsaturated
material having distributed throughout a thermoplastic, low
molecular weight material, which is present in an amount
effective to prevent

<CLAIMS>
A method for fabrication of castings comprising the steps
of:


forming an investment pattern (11, 30) having an outer
skin (14), a fill riser (16) and an inner labyrinth (12) by


positioning a first grid (8) to form a first
portion of said pattern (11, 30), said grid (8) having a

first cross section;
positioning a second grid (10) to form a second
portion of said pattern (11, 30), said grid (10) having a

second cross section;
arranging said first and said second grid (8, 10)
so that said second cross section is not aligned with said

first cross section;
draining said inner labyrinth (12) of ultraviolet
curable material; and
curing said investment pattern (11, 30) in an
ultraviolet oven;
positioning said investment pattern (11, 30) on a
support (62);
coating said investment pattern (11, 30) in a coating
solution (64);
sifting said coated investment pattern (11, 30) with a
refractory medium (72) to form a mold (68); 
removing said investment pattern (11, 30);
filling said mold (68) with casting material in order
to form a casting; and
removing said mold (68) to release said casting.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of
flushing said mold (68).
The method of claim 2, further comprising flushing said
mold (68) with air and water.
An investment pattern adapted to be used in the
production of castings, said investment pattern (11, 30)

being 
characterized by
a first grid (8) forming a portion of said investment
pattern (11, 30), said first grid (8) having a first cross

section;
a second grid (10) forming a portion of said investment
pattern (11, 30), said second grid (10) having a second

cross section;
a gate (16) to drain said investment pattern (11, 30),
said first grid (8) and said second grid (10) being

positioned adjacent so that liquid ultraviolet curable
solution flows through said gate (16).
An investment pattern as in claim 4, wherein each of said
grids (8, 10) comprises at least two elements coupling at

least two sides of each of said grids.
An investment pattern as in claim 5, wherein each of said
at least two elements are substantially perpendicular to the

other of said at least two elements.
An investment pattern as in claim 6, wherein a first
element of said first grid (8) and a second element of said

second grid (10) form an angle of substantially 45Â°.
