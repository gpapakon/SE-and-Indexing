<ABSTRACT>
A washing machine for fire hoses contains at least one pair of brush rollers (11, 12) between a hose inlet opening and a hose outlet opening, which brush rollers are arranged axially parallel to one another on both sides of the hose path and can be driven with a rotary motion. The brush rollers (11,12) have an axial length enabling at least two hoses (1, 2) to be passed through simultaneously. At least one of the brush rollers (roller 11) is divided in the axial direction into single rollers (20,21) which can be moved independently of one another in the direction towards the other brush roller (12) or away from the latter and are assigned in each case to one hose to be washed.

Washing machine for fire hoses, containing between a hose
inflow orifice and a hose outflow orifice at least one pair of

rotary brushes, mounted with parallel axes on either side of the
hose path, and drivable to perform a rotary movement, with an

axial length allowing the simultaneous passage of at least two
hoses, characterized in that at least one of the rotary brushes

(rotary brush 11) is divided axially into individual rollers (20,
21) capable of moving independently of one another towards or

away from the other rotary brush (12) and each assigned to one
of the hoses (1, 2) to be washed.
Washing machine according to claim 1, characterized in that
the rotary brush (11) arranged on top in the vertical direction

is divided into individual rollers (20, 21).
Washing machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the individual rollers (20, 21) are in contact with the

hoses being guided through, under the force of their own weight
and/or a spring force, in such a way that the hose concerned

including its coupling elements constitutes a movement control
for the individual roller which automatically adapts its position

to the current hose cross-section.
Washing machine according to claim 3, characterized in that
a movement mechanism (16) provided at the side of and outside the

hose outlet orifice (8), with at least one coupling support (17)
for hanging up a hose coupling element (5, 6), is assigned a

control unit so that the movement mechanism (16) after the
initial hanging-up of the coupling element concerned, moves first

towards the washing machine so that the coupling element is 
washed there, after which the direction of movement of the

movement mechanism (16) is reversed to pull at least one hose
through the washing machine in the opposite direction (18).
Washing machine according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in
that the individual rollers (20, 21) are supported by vibration

dampers, in particular pneumatic springs (22).
Washing machine according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that, in the event of only one rotary brush of

the pair or pairs of rotary brushes being divided into individual
rollers (20, 21) capable of independent movement, a brush rim

(24) projecting radially at the other rotary brush (12) is
assigned to the intermediate space (23) extending axially between

every two individual rollers (20, 21).
Washing machine according to any of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the individual rollers (20, 21) are of

varying length.
Washing machine according to any of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the individual rollers (20, 21) are

pivotably mounted.
Washing machine according to claim 8, characterized in that
the individual rollers (20, 21) are each mounted on a swivel

bracket (27, 28), with the swivel brackets in turn being mounted
on a continuous swivel axis (33) common to all swivel brackets.
Washing machine according to claim 9, characterized in that
the drive of the individual rollers (20, 21) is derived from a

drive shaft (34) formed by or guided through the swivel axis
(33), expediently by means of a belt drive.
Washing machine according to claim 10, characterized in that
the drive shaft is driven only at one end. 
Washing machine according to any of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that one of the rotary brushes, expediently the

rotary brush (11) divided into individual rollers (20, 21), is
mounted on a machine housing top section (44) which can be moved

away from the machine housing bottom section (45) containing the
other rotary brush (12), from its operating position into an open

housing position.
Washing machine according to claim 12, characterized in that
the machine housing top section (44) can be swung up around a

hinge axis (46) located on one of the housing sides facing the
rotary brush end faces.
Washing machine according to claim 12 or 13, characterized
in that the drive of the rotary brush (11) mounted on the machine

housing top section (44) is effected by means of a driving gear
(40) located on the machine housing bottom section (45) and a

mating gear located on the machine housing top section (44),
which engage with one another in the operating position of the

top section (44), and are disengaged in the open housing
position.
Washing machine according to claim 14, characterized in that,
when the top section (44) is transferred from the open position

to the operating position, the connecting line running between
the mid-points of the two gears (40, 41) in the operating

position and the direction of movement of the mating gear (41),
are at an angle to one another.
Washing machine according to any of claims 1 to 15,
characterized in that it contains washing water outlet nozzles

leading into its interior for washing water under enhanced or
high pressure.
