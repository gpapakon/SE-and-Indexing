A precompression pump comprising a cylindrical pump 
housing (1) containing a slidable annular plunger (3) 

controlled by a push-rod (7, 40) which slides in said 
plunger and including an outlet passage (7a, 41a, 42a) 

leading to the pump housing (1) via a side opening (7b, 
42b), the plunger including a substantially axial annular 

lip (4) that interacts with the push rod to block or 
clear said side opening, the push rod being connected to 

the plunger by a first resilient member (34, 47) which 
pushes the plunger back into a position in which said 

side opening is blocked, said first resilient member 
urging said plunger towards an annular ram (8, 44) which 

urges said lip (4) radially towards the push rod (7, 40) 
by wedging it, the pump being characterized in that the 

ram (8, 44) is further designed to abut the plunger (3) 
outside said lip (4), thereby limiting movement of the 

ram (8, 44) and the plunger (3) towards each other, and 
thus limiting the radial clamping force applied to said 

plunger lip (4). 
A precompression pump including at least:
 
   a cylindrical pump housing (1) having first and 

second ends (1a, 1c),
 
   an annular plunger (3) slidable axially in said pump 

housing (1),
 
   a push rod (40) slidable in said plunger (3) and 

passing through said second end (1c) of the pump housing, 
said push rod extending axially between a first end (41f) 

outside the pump housing and a second end (42e) inside 
the pump housing, said push rod having a blind passage 

(41a, 42a) extending axially from the first end (41f) of 
the push rod to a side opening (42b) inside the pump 

housing, the plunger including an annular central lip (4) 
extending partway towards the first end (1a) of the pump 

housing, said central lip (4) being adapted to slide in 
sealed contact with at least one part (42d) of the push  

 
rod between said side opening (42b) and the second end 

(42e) of the push rod, said central lip (4) being adapted 
to clear the side opening of the push rod when the 

plunger (3) is displaced sufficiently far towards the 
first end (41f) of the push rod,
 
characterized in that the pump further includes:
 
   an annular ram (44) fastened to the push rod (40) 

and disposed between the side opening (42a) of the push 
rod and the first end (1a) of the pump housing,
 
   a first resilient member (47) mounted between the 

push rod (40) and the plunger (3) and urging said plunger 
(3) towards the ram (44) so that the central lip (4) of 

the plunger is pressed against the ram (44), the ram (44) 
and the central lip (4) having shapes such that the ram 

applies an inward radial clamping force to the central 
lip (4), by wedging it,
 
and the ram (44) is further adapted to abut against the 

plunger (3) outside the central lip (4), which limits 
movement of the ram (44) and the plunger (3) towards each 

other and thereby limits the radial clamping force 
applied to the central lip of the plunger. 
A pump according to claim 2 further characterized in 
that said first end of the pump includes an inlet valve 

(15, 16) and the pump further includes a second resilient 
member (48) which urges the push rod (40) towards said 

second end (1c) of the pump housing. 
A precompression pump including at least:
 
   a cylindrical pump housing (1) having a first end 

(1a) fitted with an inlet valve (15, 16) and a second end 
(1c),
 
   an annular plunger (3) slidable axially in said pump 

housing (1),
 
   a push rod (7) slidable in said plunger (3) and 

passing through said second end (1c) of the pump housing, 
said push rod extending axially between a first end (7f)  

 
outside the pump housing and a second end (7j) inside the 

pump housing, said push rod having a blind passage (7a) 
extending axially from the outside end (7f) of the push 

rod to a side opening (7b) inside the pump housing, the 
plunger including an annular central lip (4) extending 

partway towards the first end (1a) of the pump housing, 
said central lip (4) being adapted to slide in sealed 

contact with at least one part (42d) of the push rod 
between said side opening (7b) and the second end (7j) of 

the push rod, said central lip (4) being adapted to clear 
the side opening of the push rod when the plunger (3) is 

displaced sufficiently far towards the first end (7f) of 
the push rod,
 
   a first resilient member (34) disposed between the 

push rod and the plunger to urge said plunger towards the 
second end (7j) of the push rod,
 
   an annular ram (8) disposed between the plunger (3) 

and the first end (1a) of the pump housing, slidable in 
said pump housing and mobile axially relative to the push 

rod (40),
 
   a second resilient member (35) urging the ram (8) 

towards the second end (1c) of the pump housing so that 
the ram (8) is pressed against the central lip (4) of the 

plunger, said ram (8) and said central lip (4) having 
shapes such that the ram applies an inward radial 

clamping force to the central lip (4), by wedging it, 
simultaneously urging said central lip axially towards 

the second end (1c) of the pump housing,
 
characterized in that the ram (8) is further adapted to 

abut against the plunger (3) outside the central lip (4), 
which limits movement of the ram (8) and the plunger (3) 

towards each other and thereby limits the radial clamping 
force applied to the central lip (4) of the plunger. 
A pump according to any one of claims 2 to 4 further 
characterized in that the ram (44) has an annular inside 

surface (44a) facing the central lip (4) of the plunger,  
 

widening in the direction towards the second end (1c) of 
the pump housing. 
A pump according to any one of claims 2 to 4 further 
characterized in that the central lip (4) of the plunger 

has an annular outside surface (4a) facing the ram (8) 
and whose outside diameter increases in the direction 

towards the second end (1c) of the pump housing. 
A pump according to any one of claims 2 to 5 further 
characterized in that the ram (8, 44) has a ring (8b, 44) 

adapted to abut against the plunger (3) outside the 
central lip (4) and said ring includes radial cut-outs 

(8a, 44a). 
A pump according to any one of claims 2 to 6 further 
characterized in that the part (7, 42d) of the push rod 

on which the central lip (4) of the plunger slides in 
sealed manner is cylindrical. 
A pump according to any one of claims 2 to 6 further 
characterized in that the part (7g, 42d) of the push rod 

on which the central lip (4) of the plunger slides in 
sealed manner has a peripheral radially outward 

projection (50) near the side opening (42b) of the push 
rod (40) and the central lip (4)
 of the plunger has a 
cylindrical inside surface (4b) facing said projection 

(50). 
A pump according to any one of the preceding claims 
further characterised in that the first resilient member 

(47) is a coil spring and the plunger (3) includes 
projections (49) on which said coil spring (47) bears. 
A pump according to any one of the preceding claims 
further characterised in that the plunger has at least 

one periphery (3b, 45) sliding in sealed contact with a  
 

part (7, 41d) of the push rod between the side opening
