<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printer cartridge assembly including a 
cartridge body (11) with at least one ink chamber from 

which ink flows to a print head. A standpipe (14) in 
the ink chamber includes an opening (13) therethrough 

for the flow of ink to the print head, and a filter cap 
(17) is secured on the top of the standpipe to limit the 

introduction of air bubbles and particulate matter in 
the flow of ink toward the print head. The filter cap 

includes a mesh material (18) formed into a dome-shaped 
configuration and an elastomeric material (19) molded 

about the periphery of the mesh portion, with the 
elastomeric material being received around the top 

portion of the standpipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ink jet print heads 
and more particularly concerns such a print head which 
includes a filter to prevent the introduction of 
particulate matter and air bubbles into the flow path to 
the print head nozzles. In an ink jet print head, liquid ink is contained in the 
interior of an ink chamber in a print head body, usually 
retained within a foam material. Such print heads 
combine ink storage and drop ejection functions in a 
single package. The print head includes an ink 
reservoir made up of one or more chambers containing 
ink-saturated porous material and a print element in 
which electronic and fluidic components that control the 
ejection of ink droplets reside. Interconnection 
between the ink reservoir and the print element is 
accomplished by an ink manifold. Filter/standpipe 
structures, one in each reservoir chamber for each color 
of ink, form a part of the ink manifold. In the past, a fine mesh filter has been affixed to the 
entrance of each standpipe. The filter is in intimate 
contact with the porous reservoir material above the 
standpipe, which is typically a polyurethane foam. The 
filter/standpipe assembly performs a number of essential 
functions. Since the porous reservoir material is 
chosen to be deformable, the filter/standpipe assembly 
compresses the reservoir material near the filter. This 
compression ensures intimate contact between the filter 
and the reservoir material. The filter also acts as a 
capillary drain, allowing ink passage upon demand but 
preventing air passage into the standpipe. This 
function is enhanced by the intimate contact between the  
 
filter and the reservoir material. A proper balance 
between filter pore size and reservoir material 
compression ensures a high reservoir drainage 
efficiency. Finally, the most obvious function of the 
filter is to prevent passage of contaminant particles 
into the print element. If contaminant particles enter 
the print element, they can block the tiny ink channels 
found in the high resolution print elements. Foremost among the requirements of an acceptable filter 
bond to the standpipe is that it extend around the 
entire perimeter of the contact line between the filter 
and the standpipe. This is made difficult by the usual 
difference in material properties between the filter and 
the standpipe. In one prior ink cartridge, for example, 
the filter is a stainless steel wire mesh while the 
standpipe is a polyphenylene oxide resin. Failure to 
achieve a complete bond around the

<CLAIMS>
A cartridge assembly for an ink jet printer 
comprising a cartridge body (11) defining an ink 

reservoir, the cartridge body including a standpipe 
portion (14) in the ink reservoir through which ink 

can flow to a print head, and a filter cap (17) for 
the standpipe portion including a base portion (19) 

surrounding a filter portion (18), the base portion 
being shaped to be received on the standpipe 

portion in the ink reservoir. 
The cartridge assembly of claim 1 in which the 
standpipe portion (14) of the cartridge body (11) 

has a top with a first shape, and the base portion 
(19) of the filter cap (17) is of a size and shape 

to be snugly received on the top of the standpipe 
portion. 
The cartridge assembly of claim 1 or 2 in which the 
base portion (19) of the filter cap (17) and the 

top of the standpipe portion (14) of the cartridge 
body (11) are substantially annular. 
The cartridge assembly of any of claims 1 to 3 in 
which the base portion (19) of the filter cap (17) 

is of elastomeric material and the filter portion 
(18) of the filter cap is a mesh element around 

which the elastomeric material has been molded. 
The cartridge assembly of claim 4 in which the mesh 
element (18) is preformed in a generally convex 

shape. 
An ink cartridge for an ink jet printer comprising 
a cartridge body (11) which includes an ink 

chamber, a standpipe (14) in the chamber having an  
 

opening (13) therethrough, an exit port in 
communication with the opening in the standpipe so 

that ink can flow from the ink chamber through the 
standpipe to the exit port, and a filter cap (17) 

secured on the standpipe comprising a filter 
element (18) and an elastomeric material (19) 

molded about the periphery of the filter element, 
the elastomeric material being received on a top 

portion of the standpipe.
