which are distributed in any way, are of any shapes and 

sizes, and are surrounded at least partially by cavity 
areas (3) in which the said two sheets (1, 2) are separate 

from each other; the cavity areas (3) may or may not 
communicate with each other, and the thickness of each of 

the two sheets (1, 2) is from 0.3 to 1.2 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a panel of plastic
material.Panels of plastic material are very widely used
at present in various branches of industry, for example
in the inner facing of vehicles, in building, in furniture
manufacture, and other areas.The object of the invention is to provide a
facing panel of the type indicated above, in such a way
that its weight can be reduced by simple and easily
formed construction, while improving its qualities of
flexibility, rigidity and strength.The invention achieves the said object with a
panel of the type described initially which consists of
two sheets known under the registered trademark Wood-Stock,
in other words a thermoplastic material
(polypropylene) filled with wood flour or similar, these
two sheets having delimited areas of mutual contact which
are distributed in any way, are of any shapes and sizes,
and are surrounded at least partially by cavity areas in
which the said two sheets are separate from each other;
the cavity areas may or may not communicate with each
other.Each of the sheets of Wood-Stock has, in particular,
a thickness from 0.3 to 1.2 mm, preferably from 0.5
to 0.6 mm.The outer side of the sheet on the visible face
of the panel, and optionally also the outer side of the
sheet on the rear face of the panel, may be covered with
a finishing sheet, such as a cloth, a fabric, a non-woven
fabric, simulated leather, adhesive melamine papers, or
similar.The finishing sheets, particularly non-woven
fabrics, may have weights from 20 g/m2 to 500 g/m2. In one
possible and preferred composition, the sheet consists of 
polyester, viscose, polypropylene, nylon, cotton mixture,
PVC, melamine material, or similar.In one embodiment, one of the sheets of Wood-Stock
is substantially flat, or is shaped in a form
complementary to the surface to which it is to be applied
or adapted, or has a substantially continuous development
according to the shape required by the client, while the
other is further shaped so that it has a plurality of
indentations in the areas of contact with the first
sheet. The sheet provided with indentations may form the
visible face or the rear face of the panel, as necessary.In an alternative embodiment, both sheets of
Wood-Stock may have a plurality of indentations forming
the areas of mutual contact.Owing to this construction, the weight of the
panel according to the invention may be reduced by
between approximately 10% and 60% by comparison with
Wood-Stock panels of conventional construction, with a
consequent saving of materials and
