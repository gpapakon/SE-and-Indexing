<ABSTRACT>
An image processing system combines a multitude of image signals to 
create a compound image. The system has a plurality of memory modules operative to 

store the image signals as pixels for the compound image as respective segments of 
consecutive pixels. A specific row of consecutive pixels of the compound image is 

formed by consecutive arrangement of the respective segments. This permits the use of 
a simple addressing protocol, and of simple page-mode access DRAMs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an image processing system for combining a
multitude of image data streams to create a compound image. The system comprises a
plurality of memory modules being operative in combination to store the image data as
pixels for the compound image. It also concerns a method for creating
a row of pixels for a compound image by combining a plurality of image data streams.U.S. Patent 5,068,650 discloses such an image processing system using a
window compilation technique to combine image data from a plurality of sources, e.g.,
video data and still image data including text and computer-generated graphics. Multimedia
integration typically requires large amounts of high-bandwidth memories to
implement multiple-window processing functions for full-motion video images (e.g.,
multiple-source gen-lock, variable scaling variable positioning, and scan rate
conversion) and high-resolution animated graphics (e.g., Î±-channelling, block moving,
multiple-windowing), all in real-time. The aforesaid prior art discloses a multi-ported
high-performance memory system. Each independent memory port provides random
access to addressed memory locations.The memory system of the prior art stores the data according to an
interleaving strategy on a pixel-to-pixel basis. In order to establish a pattern of
overlapping windows, it is necessary to write into the memory the data that will be
displayed in the windows defined by the pattern. To this end, a key is assigned to each
pixel location of the memory system. A particular key represents a particular one of a
plurality of overlapping windows making up the compound image. Each pixel to be
written contains key data, corresponding to the window within which it is intended to be
displayed. The key data acts serves to gain access to an addressed location within the
specific window corresponding to the actual key data. The key-based memory access
thus provides a unified approach to determine which pixels of the incoming image data
are written into the memory system at particular memory locations to properly reflect 
visibility of a predetermined pattern of windows.The prior art memory system contains a plurality of 16 memory modules.
Pixels from consecutive columns of a line in the eventual compound image are stored in
consecutive memory modules in a round robin fashion. Accordingly, the clock
controlling the operation of an individual memory module is lowered by a factor of 16
with regard to the basic clock for the operation of the memory system as a whole.The prior art
