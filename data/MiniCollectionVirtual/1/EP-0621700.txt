terminal equipment as a transmission source of the data 

is different from a reception wavelength of a 
destination terminal equipment as a destination of the 

data, wavelength conversion is performed such that a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a terminal
equipment used in optical communications and a network
system for performing optical communications and, more
particularly, to a network system for performing
information transmission among terminal equipments
using a plurality of wavelengths.As a conventional dynamic image network system,
for example, an optical ring network having the
arrangement shown in Fig. 1 comprises a video camera
176 as a dynamic image signal source, a display 177 as
a dynamic image output device, and a terminal 178
connected to the video camera and the display. The
terminal 178 has a function of coding a dynamic image
signal from the video camera to a desired digital
signal, and outputting the digital signal to a network
interface 179, and a function of decoding a digital
signal input from the network interface 179, and 
inputting the decoded signal to the dynamic image
output device.The network interface 179 has a function of
checking a slot which circulates on the optical ring
network shown in Fig. 1, and inserting a digital signal
output from the terminal into an empty channel, and a
function of reading out a digital signal from a channel
addressed to the own terminal. Note that an optical
fiber 180 is used as a transmission path of an optical
signal which is transmitted along the optical ring
network.Furthermore, as the second prior art of a
dynamic image network of this type, a dynamic image
network system with a broad transmission bandwidth
adopts an arrangement in which a plurality of terminals
are connected to an optical fiber 181 as a ring-shaped
optical transmission path for transmitting optical
signals of a plurality of wavelengths, as shown in,
e.g., Fig. 2.Referring to Fig. 2, a divider 183 divides an
optical signal transmitted on the optical fiber 181
into optical signals sent to a plurality of (m) fixed
wavelength filters 1 to m 191, and a power multiplexer
184. The power multiplexer 184 multiplexes an optical
signal emerging from the divider 183 and optical
signals output from a plurality of (m) fixed wavelength
lasers 1 to m 193, and outputs the multiplexed signal 
onto the optical fiber 181.The fixed wavelength filters 1 to m each pass
only a corresponding one of wavelength-multiplexed
optical signals λ1 to λm therethrough, and output the
signals to corresponding O/E converters 1 to m 192.
The O/E converters 1 to m respectively convert the
input optical signals into electrical signals, and
output the electrical signals to an SWI 194.The SWI 194 selects only an
