<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
measuring complement activity by quantitative analysis
and a reagent composition used therefor.The complement system is a collective term of
about 20 kinds of proteins present in animal serum such
as human serum. The complement system plays an important
role for defending living bodies from invading foreign
substances and bacteria by recognition and removal
thereof. It is well known that the complement system has
two pathways for activation, that is, the classical
pathway wherein the activation is brought about by an
immune complex and the alternative pathway wherein the
activation is brought about by polysaccharides. In the
classical pathway, the complement component is orderly
activated one after another by an immune complex of a
foreign substance (antigen) such as bacterium mainly, and
an antibody to the antigen to finally destroy the foreign
substance membrane, resulting in making the foreign
substance die or lyse. The classical pathway includes,
for example, a reaction wherein erythrocyte sensitized by
hemolysin is led to hemolysis, and a reaction wherein
liposome membrane sensitizing hapten thereon is destroyed
as in the present invention. On the other hand, the
alternative pathway does not require participation of an 
antibody. For example, in the alternative pathway,
complement is activated by only a contact with a polysaccharide,
which is a component constituting cell walls
of bacteria, or a virus. Recently, the measurement of
activity of a complement system, that is, the measurement
of a complement activity has been noticed as an index of
diagnosis and therapy of active stage of systemic lupus
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, cryoglobulinemiavasculitis,
some forms of nephritis, and inherited
deficiencies of the complement system etc.As a process for measuring a complement
activity now generally and widely used, it is known the
Mayer method or its variations wherein hemolysis activity
of complement is measured using antibody-sensitized sheep
erythrocyte ["Rinsho Kensaho Teiyo", pp. 1233-1234, 29ed,
5th print, 1985 published by Kanehara Shuppan Co., Ltd.;
J. Clin. Chem., 12, 143 (1983), etc.]. But the Mayer
method is a very complicated method wherein a number of
samples with various dilutions for one sample to be
measured are prepared to carry out the reaction, and
complement activity is measured by obtaining an amount
for bringing about 50% hemolysis (CH50 U/ml) based on such
results. Further, there are various problems in that the

<CLAIMS>
A process for measuring human complement
activity, which comprises


i) reacting a sample with liposomes, wherein the
liposomes have (1) a size within the range of 100 to 500

nm, which size is determined by a mean particle size in nm plus
twice the standard deviation, said mean particle size and

said standard deviation being obtained or calculated from
a particle size distribution measured by a dynamic light

scattering method, (2) an encapsulated marker therein
which is liberated and measured when the liposomes are

ruptured by the action of complement against an antigen-antibody
complex formed on membranes of the liposomes,

(3) a hapten immobilized on surfaces of liposome
membranes, and (4) an antibody which binds to the hapten,
ii) measuring an amount of liberated marker
according to the degree of rupture of liposome membranes,

and
iii) measuring human complement activity in the
sample on the basis of the amount of liberated marker thus

obtained.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the
human complement activity is determined by using a

calibration curve prepared by using a serum derived from
human beings or animals as a complement standard solution.
A process according to Claim 2, wherein the
complement standard solution is a serum derived from rat,

goat, sheep or human being.
A process according to Claim 3, wherein the
complement standard solution is a serum derived from rat. 
A reagent composition for measuring human
complement activity comprising


(a) liposomes, wherein the liposomes have (1) a
size within the range of 100 to 500 nm, which size is

determined by a mean particle size in nm plus twice the
standard deviation, said mean particle size and said

standard deviation being obtained or calculated from a
particle size distribution measured by a dynamic light

scattering method, (2) an encapsulated marker therein
which is liberated and measured when the liposomes are

ruptured by the action of complement against an antigen-antibody
complex formed on membranes of the liposomes,

(3) a hapten immobilized on surfaces of liposome
membranes, and
(b) an antibody bonded to the hapten.
A composition according to Claim 5, which
further comprises (c) a serum derived from an animal as a

complement standard solution.
A composition according to Claim 5, wherein the
liposomes and the antibody to the hapten are stored in

different containers until the measurement of human
complement activity.
A composition according to Claim 6, wherein the
complement standard solution is a serum derived from rat,

goat, sheep or human being.
A composition according to Claim 8, wherein the
complement standard solution is a serum derived from rat.
