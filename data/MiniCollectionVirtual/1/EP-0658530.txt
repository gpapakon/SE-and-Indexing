<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane which comprises dechlorofluorinating 1,1,2,2-pentafluoro-3,3-dichloropropane 
and/or 1,1,2,2,3-pentafluoro-1,3-dichloropropane wi
th hydrogen in the presence of a metal oxide catalyst, and fluorinating 
the resultant olefin in the presence of a catalyst. This process serves to produce readily at a low cost 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane, 

which is useful as a working fluid and is capable of environmental protection, and an intermediate for the preparation 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane
at low cost, which is a hydrofluorocarbon having no fear of destroying
ozone layer and may be substituted for chlororfluorocarbons which have
been used as working fluids and blowing agents, and also relates to a method
of producing tetrafluorochloropropene, an intermediate in the synthesis
of 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane.Until now, 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane is known to be obtained by hydrogenation
of hexafluoropropene. However, hexafluoropropene as a raw material
is expensive. Therefore, the fluoropropane produced by the process of
using hexafluoropropene as a raw material is inevitable to be expensive and
its applications are limited.JP 870 0183657 discloses a method of producing trifluorochloroethylene
by reacting 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane with hydrogen using a Cu-Cr-Ba-Mn
based oxide as a catalyst.EP-A-298 662 discloses a process for the preparation of 1,1,1-trifluorodichloroethane
and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluorochloroethane by fluorination of a tetrahaloethylene
in the presence of a catalyst comprising at least one metal in an
oxidation state greater than zero, said metal being selected from the group
consisting of Cr, Mn, Ni and Co.This invention is aimed at offering a method of easily 
producing 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane at low cost, which
is useful as a working fluid and so on and has a property to
help preserving the environment, and an intermediate in its
synthesis.This invention relates to
a method of producing 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane in a characteristic
process in which tetrafluorochloropropene is first obtained from
the dechlorofluorination of 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoro-3,3-dichloropropane
and/ or 1,1,2,2,3-pentafluoro-1,3-dichloropropane by hydrogen in the
presence of a metal oxide catalyst and then the produced olefin is fluorinated
in the presence of a catalyst. As a result of eagerly studying of the process of
producing 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane efficiently and at
low cost, the inventor found a process in which 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane
is derived at high selectivity from
1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoro-3,3-dichloropropane and / or
1,1,2,2,3-pentafluoro-1,3-dichloropropane which are
available at low cost, having reached this invention.That is, this invention relates to a method of
producing 1,1,1,2,3,3-hexafluoropropane in a characteristic
process in which tetrafluorochloropropene is first obtained
from dechlorofluorinating (removing ClF) 1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoro-3,3-dichloro
propane and / or
