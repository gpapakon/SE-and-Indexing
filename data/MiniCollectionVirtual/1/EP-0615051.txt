<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is a covering which can be unrolled, as is, in particular, frequently expedient for shading purposes for glass roofs. The covering (5), usually consisting of canvas, is subjected to very high tensile forces during operation, with the result that the yield point of the warp threads is easily exceeded, this having the effect that it can no longer extend in a planar surface. The invention eliminates this disadvantage in that the diameter of the fully wound-up covering roll (1) and of the base of the winding-up reel (3) on which the tension means are seated are of essentially the same size. In this arrangement, in the rolled-in state of the covering, the tensile stressing is virtually 0, whereas the highest tensile-stressing value exists into the stretched-out state.

Unrollable covering for substantially horizontally
extending areas of buildings, in particular glass roofs,

wherein the covering (5) can be wound up on a covering roll
(1) for which fixed bearing blocks (25) are provided and

has its free end held in an edge rod (6) of which the ends
can be driven in guide rails, so that the covering (5) is

unrolled to the predetermined extent by means of the edge
rod (6), while a pulling means (4) is deflected by 180Â°

around a front deflecting pulley (8) and can then be wound
up on a take-up reel (3), wherein for regulation of tension

between the covering roll (1) and the take-up reel (3)

provided alongside said covering roll there is an elastic
connection (15) for the pulling means (4) and the diameter

of the core (2) of the take-up reel (3), on which the first
turn of the pulling means (4) comes to lie, is selected in

relation to the diameter of the fully wound-up covering
roll (1) such that the tension acting on the covering

increases as it is unwound,

characterised in that

the diameter of the core (2) of the take-up reel (3) is
equal to the diameter of the fully wound-up covering roll

(1) and the thickness of the pulling means (4) is at most
equal to that of the covering (5). 
Covering according to claim 1

characterised in that

the elastic connection (15) between covering roll (1) and
take-up reel (3) is designed on the basis that with the

covering (5) fully rolled up the tension applied is as
small as possible and in the fully unrolled state it is as

great as possible, the tension being selected so as to
obtain an optically satisfactory state of the covering (5)

in its run-out state without exceeding the elastic limit.
