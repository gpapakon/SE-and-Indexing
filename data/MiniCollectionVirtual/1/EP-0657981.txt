<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus is comprised of a circuit wherein an alternating current input is 
connected in series to a lighting lamp or resistor, or other specific use, which produces 

a residual consumption, and a rectifier or sets of rectifiers which are also connected in 
series to said circuit and have outputs of direct current switched to the charger, which 

may also be used as lamp, resistor, etc., at the same time as the charge is effected or 
without the charge being effected. Application to the recharging of storage batteries in 

household appliances and/or other electric apparatuses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention has as its aim a circuit and device with a 
specific function, for example a light, heater, ventilator that 
has a common operation output with said device, so that the 
former can be used without the latter, which when connected to 
accumulators, batteries or electric cells recharges the same. 
This invention has two essentially identical embodiments, with 
the second being provided with a greater number of rectifiers 
being more suitable for charging more powerful batteries, which, 
due to carrying a more rectified current, enable greater and 
faster efficiency when charging, both as regards batteries and 
electric cells of any kind. Known technical antecedents do not coincide with the 
essence of this application, but we shall nevertheless mention 
the following:
 
   Patent ES P8603535 for a power system for batteries and 
electronic equipment which work by battery when there is no 
mains supply, fitted with a booster/reducing divider, that 
requires converter filters and requires a function of 
maintaining the voltage at a predetermined level. The new patent 
avoids all these disadvantages, being only a charger suitable 
for any device that may receive a charge. Patent no. ES P0549608 for charging equipment for 
electrical traction batteries, made up of a microprocessor that 
receives information as regards the mains supply, the 
connections of the lines, voltage at the output of the rectifier 
and current sensor, all of this being simplified in the new 
invention with the technical and economic advantages implied. Patent no. ES P0498043 for a voltage regulation device for 
direct current applied to an alternator flywheel, made up of an 
electronic device that substitutes a resistance for a transistor 
applied to an alternator flywheel, which produces, through a 
flywheel generator, a positive voltage, completely different 
from the assembly which we are now concerned with, that has no  
 
moving parts or transistors or complex circuitry. The present invention consists of a circuit made up of a 
device that determines an electrical consumption, set out in 
series with a rectifier or several rectifiers in series layout, 
provided at their direct current outputs with a commuted switch, 
in such a way that the use of the device set out in series in 
said circuit is possible in either of the two positions of the 
commuted switch if there is an accumulator fitted, having to 
change to the charge position if there is an accumulator, and 
to the no charge position if said accumulator is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Circuit and apparatus for recharging storage batteries 
or electric cells, and other specific use thereof, characterized 

in that it is made up of a circuit properly said that has a 
resistance, household electrical item, lamp, etc., in series 

with a rectifier, at whose output there is a commuted switch (7) 
that determines the completion of the circuit, either during 

charging through the charge output (8) or through said switch 
(7), possibly having a Led light to come on when each of both 

these circuits is completed, and being fitted with a diode (9) 
at the negative pole that prevents the return of the current. 
Circuit and apparatus for recharging storage batteries 
or electric cells, and other specific use thereof, characterized 

in that the circuit is made up of a set of rectifiers (5, 10, 
11) in series, between which there is at each pole a diode, each 

one of the outputs (12, 13, 14, 15) of each rectifier 
determining the existence of a terminal that can be used 

independently, apart from the terminals of the output (8), 
possibly taking in a commuted switch for completing the circuit.
