<ABSTRACT>
A laminated glass having at least one glass sheet and 
at least one resin film or resin sheet bonded with a 

silane coupling agent layer interposed therebetween, 
wherein the silane coupling agent layer is a layer of a 

mixture comprising at least one silane coupling agent 
capable of providing bond strength for the bonding 

between the glass sheet and the resin film or resin 
sheet, and at least one silane coupling agent incapable 

of providing bond strength for the bonding between the 
glass sheet and the resin film or resin sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing laminated glass
having controlled bond strength which is useful for e.g.
vehicles such as automobiles and buildings.Laminated glass consisting of a glass sheet and a
resin film or resin sheet (hereinafter generally referred
to as a resin film) is known. It is also known to
produce such laminated glass by coating a silane coupling
agent capable of providing bond strength (i.e. capable of
imparting bond strength) on the surface of a glass sheet
to which a resin film is to be bonded, or by coating or
incorporating a silane coupling agent capable of
providing bond strength to the surface of a resin film to
be bonded to a glass sheet.The above prior art using a silane coupling agent
capable of imparting bond strength is satisfactory from
the viewpoint of firmly bonding the glass sheet and the
resin film. However, it has been difficult or impossible
to maintain the bond strength over a long period of time 
while securing the durability.Penetration resistance and shock resistance are
important requirements for laminated glass. The
penetration resistance of laminated glass consisting of a
glass sheet and at least one resin film, against shock at
the time when a vehicle using such laminated glass is
involved in a collision accident, depends largely on the
above-mentioned bond strength.Namely, if the bond strength is too high, the
penetration resistance tends to be low, whereby a danger
to the passenger of the vehicle increases. To secure the
safety of the passenger, it will be necessary to increase
the thickness of the resin film, but such is not
economical since an extra material is required.On the other hand, if the bond strength is low, the
shock resistance tends to be poor, although the
penetration resistance may be good. If an automobile or
the like using such laminated glass is involved in a
collision, glass fragments are likely to scatter, which
is very dangerous.In the above-mentioned conventional laminated glass,
the silane coupling agent coated on the surface of the
resin film or incorporated in the resin film, transfers
or migrates to the interface between the glass sheet and
the resin film to form a layer of the silane coupling
agent therebetween, which serves to control the bond
strength. To obtain proper adhesive strength or bond strength
solely with the silane coupling agent capable of
providing bond strength, it is sufficient to incorporate
the silane coupling agent in a very small amount at a
level of from 0.05 to 0.2 wt% to the resin film.

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a laminated glass having at least one glass sheet and
at least one resin film or resin sheet bonded with a silane coupling agent layer

interposed therebetween, which comprises coating on at least one of the
surface of the glass sheet and the surface of the resin film or resin sheet a

bond strength for the bonding between the glass sheet and the resin film or

resin sheet, followed by drying, and then bonding the resin film or resin sheet
and the glass sheet so that the surface having the mixture of the silane

coupling agents coated thereon will be the bonded surface, wherein a solution
or dispersion of the mixture of the silane coupling agents is coated on the

surface of the glass sheet excessively and then wiped off with a dust-free
cloth to obtain a desired coating thickness by using a coating robot having a

coating tool at its forward end that is capable of coating and wiping off a
solution or dispersion of the mixture of the silane coupling agents.

providing bond strength for the bonding between the glass sheet and the

resin film or resin sheet contains at least a group capable of bonding to the
glass sheet and no functional group reactive with the resin film or resin sheet.
