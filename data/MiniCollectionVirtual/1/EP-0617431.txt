<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an X-ray analysing apparatus 
having high sensitivity and high position resolving power in which 

an X-ray fluorescent screen (48) including Gd₂O₂S : Tb as 
a material and having a surface density ranging from 5 mg/cm² 

to 30 mg/cm² is used, and an image intensifier (50) and a charge 
coupled device (CCD) (52) are combined to construct an X-ray 

diffraction two-dimensional detector; and also an image 
intensifier tube and the CCD are combined with a tapered fibre 

plate (49), and an alignment section of the mirror mount tube 
and a vacuum flexible tube are separated by an X-ray 

window into the atmosphere and the vacuum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an X-ray apparatus using diffraction X-rays, 
fluorescent X-rays, or transmission X-rays to identify or chemically analyse a microarea 
of a sample non-destructively, eg. by scanning over a line or area of the sample surface. Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. SH059-72052 discloses one of 
examples of conventional X-ray analysing apparatus. In this mechanism, a hollow 
capillary whose inside cross section is a circle, an ellipse or a polygon and whose inner 
surface is parallel and mirror-finished is extended from an X-ray source to a sample 
fixed at the centre of a sample stage composed of a triaxial precise movement mechanism 
and a biaxial rotational mechanism which are combined. An X-ray diffraction image and 
fluorescent X-rays of a microarea of the sample are received by a film or a position 
sensitive proportional counter or a guide tube for measuring fluorescent X-rays. 
According to this structure, when a tiny and thin sample is to be analysed, the hollow 
capillary extending from the X-ray source is brought close to a vicinity of the sample, 
and a thin X-ray beam approximately as thin as an internal diameter of the hollow 
capillary is directed on the sample. The fluorescent X-ray emitted from the sample is 
received by the guide tube for measuring fluorescent X-rays and measured by a 
semiconductor detector arranged at the end of the guide tube. On the other hand, the 
diffraction X-rays are measured by the film or the position sensitive proportional 
counter. By the above procedure, materials in the microarea are identified and 
chemically analysed, and the sample is area-analysed or line-analysed by a linear 
movement mechanism. Another prior art arrangement is, for example, disclosed by the Japanese Patent 
Provisional Publication No. SH061-22240. This prior art arrangement is composed of: a 
collimator for getting a thin X-ray beam incident on a minute part of a sample; a  
 
detachable spectrocrystal which is provided so that fluorescent X-rays emitted from a 
sample surface may be incident thereon; and an incident position sensitive X-ray detector 
in an arc provided so as to move around either a point which is symmetric to the 
microarea with respect to the surface of the spectrocrystal or the microarea. In this 
structure, when a tip of the collimator is brought to close vicinity to the sample, a fine 
X-ray beam is formed and the beam irradiates the microarea of the sample. The 
microarea emits fluorescent X-rays, which are reflected by the
