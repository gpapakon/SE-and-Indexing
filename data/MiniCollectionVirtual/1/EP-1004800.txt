<ABSTRACT>
A shifter for a vehicle transmission wherein a connector cap (
14
)
consisting of an organic polymeric material is molded about the top end of a

shifter lever (
12
) having a top end and a bottom end to define a first snap-on
bead (
16
) for receiving and mechanically retaining a shifter knob (
18
). A fulcrum
support (
26
) is molded on the lever (
12
) simultaneously with arid spaced from the
connector cap (
14
) closer to the bottom end of the lever (
12
) and of the same
organic polymeric material as the connector cap (
14
). The shifter knob (
18
)
comprises a retainer sleeve (
34
) consisting of organic polymeric material and a
bulbous bulb (
36
) molded about the sleeve (
34
). The sleeve (
34
) has an inner
cylindrical surface and an open sleeve bottom and a closed sleeve top (
40
) for
disposition over the connector cap (
14
). A complementary tongue (
24
) extends
downwardly from the interior of the sleeve top (
40
) for mechanically engaging a
groove (
24
) in the connector cap (
14
). The sleeve 
34
 includes slots 
52
, 
54

defining cantilevered tabs 
56
 which are flexible and extend to distal ends, a
second bead

<DESCRIPTION>
A shift lever for shifting a transmission in an automotive vehicle.As is well known, shifter levers have a knob on the top end for manual
grasping in shifting the transmission of the vehicle. In some instances, the end of
the lever is knurled and the knob is separately made of organic polymeric or
plastic material and forced onto the knurled portion in a friction fit. Alternatively,
the knob may be molded directly on the lever. However, in many instances, it is
desirable to place the knob on the lever late in the vehicle assembly process and
to select the knob from a variety of knob designs. This has been accomplished
by machining a metal part and placing it on the top end of the lever, the part
being machined in a special configuration to receive a knob.FR 2 739 063 comprises the features mentioned in the preamble
of claim 1.A shifter as described in the claim 1 for a vehicle transmission wherein a connector cap consisting of
an organic polymeric material is molded about the top end of a shifter lever
having a top end and a bottom end to define a first snap-on for receiving and
mechanically retaining a shifter knob. The connector cap presents a first snap-on
for receiving and mechanically retaining a shifter knob. Accordingly, significant saving can be attained by the subject invention as
the requirement for special and relatively expensive machining is eliminated and
closer and consistent tolerances are attained in the molding of a plastic connector
cap on the top end of the shift lever. The post machining treatments, such as
deburring, are also eliminated.Other advantages of the present invention will be readily
appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following
detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying
drawings wherein:
Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view;Figure 2 is an enlarged cross sectional view of the shifter knob;Figure 3 is an enlarged fragmentary view partially in cross section of the
sleeve on the lever; andFigure 4 is an enlarged fragmentary view of the portion in the designated
ellipse of Figure 3.Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or
corresponding parts throughout the several views, a shifter for a vehicle
transmission is generally shown at 10.A shifter lever 12 consists of metal and has a top end and a bottom end
and is characterized by a connector cap 14 consisting of an organic polymeric
material, i.e., plastic, molded about the top end and including a first snap-on, in 
the form of an annular
