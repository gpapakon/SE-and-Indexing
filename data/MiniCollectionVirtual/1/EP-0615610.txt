<ABSTRACT>
The fluid motor, e.g. a liquid meter, a mixing apparatus or a turbine, has a chamber (1) with a rotor having stiff blades (7) which at their outer ends are provided with plate formed wings (8) of elastomeric material. The wings (8) are by a thin, overlapping part fastened to the reverse side of the blades (7) in relation to the rotating direction. When passing between outlet (5) and inlet (4) of the chamber (1) the wings (8) are deflected by a wall part in the chamber. The rotor is smooth-running, noise-free and inexpensive to produce and repair in connection with abrasion of the wings.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID MOTOR-r TECHNICAL FIELD5 The present invention relates to a fluid motor having* a shaft which is operated by means of a flowing fluid, e.g. for measuring of fluid, and having a rotor mounted in a housing having a number of blades mounted regularly around the bearing shaft, each blade composed by a stiff blade of10 metal and a flexible, elastomeric part.BACKGROUND ARTFor volume measurement of flowing fluid it is known to use a rotor with blades mounted in a housing, which blades15 are pivotally connected with a rotor body and which are forcibly guided in such a way that over one part of the cylindrical wall of the housing they are turned towards this to form a barrier between the inlet and outlet port, and over another part of the cylindrical wall of the housing20 having a smaller diameter than the former they are deflected backwards relative to the rotating direction to form a seal¬ ing between this part of the cylindrical wall and the rotor. The known devices of this kind, e.g. water meters, are re¬ latively expensive to produce and repair, the blades being25 difficult to exchange piece by piece, for which reason it is often necessary to exchange the whole rotor. In many cases the rotor provides an undesired, great resistance against rotation, too. Yet another drawback of some of the known liquid meters is that the pivotally connected blades30 have a tendency to stick when the device has not been used for a longer period of time, and that they are noise gene- Λ rating.However, from US Patent Specification No. 2,753,809 ___ a motor or pump is known, the rotor of which is provided35 with blades where a metal plate is mounted along the flexible elastomeric blade part to reinforce this part which is con- 

 stituted by an extending tab on an elastomeric base embedded in a groove in the rotor. By this construction a relatively great amount of elastomeric material for each blade is in¬ volved, and in connection with abrasion of the material it is necessary to renew the whole blade.Besides, from US Patent Specifications No. 2,636,478 and No. 2,636,479 liquid meters are known where wings of flexible material are extending practically from the center of the hub to the circumference and which are supported by intricately constructed metal parts. Also by this construct¬ ion it is difficult to exchange worn parts piece by piece, and furthermore, the wings, which slide against the wall of the housing, involve a relatively great resistance against the movement of the rotor in the housing.DISCLOSURE OF THE

1. A fluid motor having a shaft which is operated by means of a flowing fluid, e.g. for measuring of fluid, and having a rotor embedded in a housing with a number of blades regularly mounted around the bearing shaft (6) , each blade being composed by a stiff blade (7) of metal and a flexible, elastomeric part (8) , characterized in that the. elastomeric parts of the blades are plate-formed wings (8) positioned at the radially outer ends of the stiff blades, each with a thin, flexible part fastened to and overlapping the outer end of the blade (7) on its side facing backwards in the rotating direction, whereas the part of the wing (8) posi¬ tioned radially outside the stiff blade (7) has a greater plate thickness and at the interface to the flexible part overlaps the edge of the blade (7) .
2. A fluid motor according to claim 1, characterized in that each wing (8) on its thin, flexible part has a un¬ dercut rib running in the axial direction of the rotor, which rib is embedded in a corresponding undercut groove in the blade (7) .
3. A fluid motor according to claims 1-2, charac¬ terized in that on the thick part positioned outside the blade (7) each wing (8) has a bead (10) or rise on the side facing forwards relative to the rotating direction.
