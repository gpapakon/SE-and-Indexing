<ABSTRACT>
In a coupling with two sections (1, 12) which are prestressed by a tensioning device with at least one cylindrical tensioning component (16) in which one conical end transverse to the coupling axis (11) of the tensioning component (16) acts on a tensioning surface (24) arranged obliquely to the coupling axis (11) and generates a tensile force acting in the direction of the coupling axis (11), an improvement in the mechanical behaviour is attained in that the coupling sections (1, 12) are made of a case-hardened material, preferably steel, the tensioning surface (24) espouses the surface of the conical end of the tensioning component and the latter (24) is made by cold extrusion before hardening.
