<ABSTRACT>
An existing sheet material feeder has a feed tray (14) which holds sheet 
material in an on-edge orientation in which side surfaces of the sheet 

material are generally vertical. An apparatus is provided to convert the 
sheet material feeder to one having a feed tray (44) which holds sheet 

material in a lying-down orientation in which side surfaces of the sheet 
material are generally horizontal. The apparatus for converting the on-edge 

sheet material feeder to the lying-down sheet material feeders includes a 
frame having a pair of parallel side sections (102). A single sheet material 

feed drum (66) is disposed between and is connected with the side sections. 
The side sections are connected with side sections of the existing collator 

conveyor sheet material feeder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
converting a collator conveyor sheet material feeder which
receives signatures in an on-edge orientation to a collator
conveyor sheet material feeder which receives signatures in
a lying-down orientation.A known collator conveyor sheet material feeder has a
hopper which holds sheet material in an on-edge orientation
in which side surfaces of the sheet material are generally
vertical. The sheet material is engaged by a rotatable
feed drum. A transfer drum and an opener drum receive
sheet material from the feed drum and open the sheet
material. The opened sheet material is deposited on a
saddle type conveyor. A known apparatus having this
construction is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,180,255
issued December 25, 1979 and entitled Wiper System
Inserter, which document represents the closest prior art. The present invention provides an improved
collator conveyor sheet
material feeder. The apparatus according to claim 1
converts the feeder from
one which receives sheet material in an on-edge orientation
to a feeder which receives sheet material in a lying-down
orientation. It is contemplated that the apparatus may be
utilized as a unit which is retrofitted to convert existing
sheet material feeders.The apparatus for converting a collator sheet material
feeder includes a pair of parallel side sections.
Fasteners are provided to secure the side sections of the
apparatus to side sections of the collator conveyor sheet
material feeder. The converter apparatus includes a single
sheet material feed drum which is disposed between and
connected with the side sections. The single sheet
material feed drum is the only sheet material feed drum
disposed between the side sections of the converter
apparatus.The foregoing and other features of the invention will
become more apparent upon a consideration of the following
description taken in connection with the accompanying
drawings wherein: 
Fig. 1 is a side elevational view, partly in section,
of a known collator conveyor sheet material feeder which
feeds sheet material from an on-edge orientation;Fig. 2 is a side elevational view, generally similar
to Fig. 1, illustrating the use of a converter apparatus,
constructed in accordance with the present invention, to
convert the feeder of Fig. 1 to feed sheet material from a
lying-down orientation;Fig. 3 is a side elevational view of the apparatus of
Fig. 2 and illustrating a drive system;Fig. 4 is an end view, taken generally along the line
4-4 of Fig. 2, further illustrating

A collator conveyor
sheet material feeder (10) which feeds sheet material from a hopper

(14) to a saddle conveyor (12) with a feed drum (20), transfer drum
(28) and opener drum (32), the sheet material in the hopper being in

an on-edge orientation in which side
surfaces of the sheet material are generally vertical,

said collator conveyor sheet material feeder
comprising first and second parallel and spaced apart side

sections (148, 156), said collator conveyor sheet material feeder
being characterized by replacing the hopper (14) by a converter

assembly (40) having first and second side
sections (100, 102) being fastened to the said side sections (148, 156)

of the collator conveyor sheet material feeder (10) by fastener means (150)
a feed tray (44) having a flat upwardly facing horizontal side

surface (48) for receiving sheet material articles with side
surfaces of the sheet material horizontal and folded edge

portions of the sheet material being gripped by, 
a single sheet material feed drum (66) disposed between and connected

with said first and second side sections (100, 102), of the converter
assembly and rotatable about an axis extending perpendicular

to said major side surfaces of said first
and second side sections (100, 102), said single sheet material feed drum

(66) being the only sheet material feed drum disposed between
said first and second side sections (100, 102)

so that the single sheets are transferred from the single sheet
material feed drum (66) to the said feed drum (20),

and spacer means
(122, 124, 126) extending between said first and second side

sections (100, 102) of the converter assembly for
interconnecting said first and second

side sections and maintaining said first and second side sections
in a spaced apart and parallel relationship.
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 further including
sucker means (70) connected with said first side section (100, 102) 

for sequentially engaging generally horizontal side surfaces of
sheet material and pulling the engaged sheet material downwardly

toward said single sheet material feed drum (66).
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 further including
pinch roller means (86) connected with said first side section

(100) for pressing sheet material against said single sheet
material feed drum (66).
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 wherein said
single sheet material feed drum (66) includes a plurality of

gripper assemblies (80, 82) for sequentially engaging edge
portions of sheet material while major side surface areas of the

sheet material are generally horizontal and for moving the sheet
material toward the feed drum (20) in the collator

conveyor sheet material feeder (10).
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 further including
a circular drive member (98) connected with said sheet material

feed drum (66) and disposed on a side of said first side section
(102) opposite from said sheet material feed drum and belt means

(94) interconnecting said circular drive member and the collator
conveyor sheet material feeder for transmitting drive force to

said circular drive member.
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 wherein said first
and second side sections (100, 102) of the converter assembly each

have parallel major side 
surfaces (104, 106, 108, 110) and at least one minor side surface

(140, 142) which extends between said major side surfaces, said
fastener means (150) secures said first side section (100) to a

side section (148) of the collator conveyor sheet material feeder
(10) with said one minor side surface (140) on said first side

section (100) in abutting engagement with a minor side surface
(146) of one of the side section of the collator conveyor sheet

material feeder (10), said fastener means (150) secures said
second side section (102) to a side section (156) of the collator

conveyor sheet material feeder with said one minor side surface
(142) on said second side section (102) in abutting engagement

with a minor side surface of one of the side sections of the
collator conveyor sheet material feeder.
