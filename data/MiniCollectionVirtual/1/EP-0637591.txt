<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a novel expression vector for 
Phytolacca antiviral protein isolated from Phytolacca americana L. and a 

microorganism transformed with said PAP expression vector. In 
accordance with the present invention, biologically active PAP can be 

produced in a massive manner from the microorganism transformed with 
the expression vector of the invention; and, therefore, the recombinant 

PAP can be practically applied to various fields, e.g., the molecular 
studies on PAP and treatment of AIDS employing immunoconjugate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel expression vector for 
antiviral protein, more specifically, a recombinant expression vector for 
Phytolacca antiviral protein isolated from Phytolacca americana L. and a 
microorganism transformed therewith. Studies on the antiviral proteins from many different plant species, 
have been carried out, starting from the discovery of pokeweed antiviral 
protein(or Phytolacca antiviral protein, hereinafter referred to as "PAP") 
isolated from crude extract of Phytolacca americana L.[see: Irvin, J. D., 
Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 169: 522-528(1975)]. In addition to the PAP, 
a few of antiviral proteins have been isolated from several plants, e.g., 
Ricin(from Ricinus communis)[see: Halling, K. C. et al., Nucleic Acid 
Res., 13: 8019-8033(1985)], Mirabilis antiviral protein("MAP", from 
Mirabilis jalapa L.)[see: Kataoka, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 
8426-8430(1991)] and Î±-trichosanthin(from Trichosanthes kirilowii) [see: 
Zhang, X. et al., Nature, 321: 477-478(1986)]. Said antiviral proteins 
have been reported to be ribosome inactivating proteins("RIPs") having 
RNA N-glycosidase activities[see: Endo, Y. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263: 
8735-8739(1988)].  In general, PAP from Phytolacca americana L. is classified as 
PAP-I, PAP-II and PAP-S that appear in spring leaves, summer leaves 
and seeds, respectively; and it is reported that antiserum reactions of 
these PAPs are different one another[see: Irvin, J. D. et al., Arch. 
Biochem. Biophys., 200: 418-425(1980)]. Further, it has been known 
that ribosome of Phytolacca americana L. is depurinated by RNA 
N-glycosidase activity of PAP. On the other hand, immunoconjugate of 
PAP with CD4 or CD19 has been reported to inhibit the replication of 
human immunodificiency virus type 1[see: Jansen, B. et al., Cancer Res., 
52: 406-412(1992); Kim Y. W. et al., J. Immunol., 144: 1257-1262(1990); 
Myers, D. E. et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 136: 221-238(1991)]; in this 
connection, said PAPs have been supposed to be applicable to the 
treatment of AIDS. Accordingly, studies on the PAPs in a view of 
molecular biology have been actively carried out, including the nucleotide 
sequence analysis of cDNA of PAP; precise mechanism of PAP's 
biological activity; construction of transgenic plant; and, application to the 
immunoconjugate preparation. Under the circumstance, the present inventors firstly developed a 
transgenic plant expressing PAP, and patent applications covering said 
expression vector are pending under the title of
