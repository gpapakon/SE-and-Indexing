<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to the use of cultured plant
cell gums in applications in oil and gas well drilling and
production, and in the pharmaceutical, textile, printing ink,
lithography, cosmetic, adhesive, paper, paint, ceramic and
cleaning detergent industries.A variety of natural and semisynthetic complex
carbohydrates or polysaccharides have been commercially
important in human and pet food manufacturing; in the
cosmetic, paper, textile, paint, agricultural, explosives,
hydrolube, adhesive, ceramic, cleaning polish, detergent, fire
fighting, ink, photography, lithography, and deodorant gel
industries; and in mining, and gas well drilling and
production. Natural complex carbohydrates and polysaccharides
include seaweed extracts, plant exudates, seed or root
extracts, and microbial 
polysaccharides produced by fermentation. Semisynthetic
complex carbohydrates and polysaccharides include cellulose
derivatives, low-methoxyl pectin, propylene glycol alginate,
triethanolamine alginate and guar gum derivatives. Sandford,
P. & Baird, J. (1983) "Industrial Utilization of
Polysaccharides" in The Polysaccharides, Vol. 2, pp. 411-491.The production of natural complex carbohydrates or
polysaccharides is frequently problematic. For plant exudates,
seed or root extracts, production is dependent on climate and
harvest conditions. For example, gum arabic is an exudate from
Acacia senegal trees. Gum production is stimulated by
stripping the bark from the trees; the gum is collected by hand
in the form of "dried tears." Production of gum arabic can
vary each year as a function of weather conditions, labor
strikes, natural disasters, etc. Meer et al. (1975) Food
Technology 29:22-30. The unreliable supply results in
variable gum arabic cost. Seed gums, such as guar gums are
expensive due to harvesting costs. Guar gum is derived from
the seed of the guar plant Cyamopsis tetragonolobus.
Processing involves removal of the seed coat, separation of the
germ from the endosperm, and milling of the endosperm.
Sandford, P. & Baird, J. (1983), supra.The production of seaweed extracts can also be
problematic. Agar production is labor intensive in that it
involves the harvesting of red seaweed by hand: in some areas
of the world, divers in full pressure suits collect individual
plants in deep water; in other places, the seaweed can be
collected at low tide without the use of diving equipment.
Carrageenan or Irish Moss is produced from another red seaweed
harvested by raking and hand gathering. Algin is produced from
brown
