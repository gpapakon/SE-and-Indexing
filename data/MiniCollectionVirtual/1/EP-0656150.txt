<DESCRIPTION>
 METAL ELECTRONIC PACKAGE INCORPORATING A MULTI-CHIP MODULEThe present invention relates to metal packages for housing a plurality of integrated circuit devices. More particularly, the invention relates to an adhesively sealed metal package having a circuit electrically interconnected to a leadframe and thermally connected to the package base.Adhesively sealed metal packages are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,105,861 to Hascoe; 4,461,924 to Butt and 4,939,316 to Mahulikar et al. The packages have a metallic base and cover. A leadframe is disposed between the base and cover and adhesively bonded to both. The leadframe may include a centrally positioned die attach paddle with an integrated circuit device bonded thereto. Bond wires electrically interconnect the device to the leadframe.One advantage of metal packages over molded plastic packages such as quad flat packs (QFPs) or ceramic packages such as ceramic dual in line packages (CERDIPs), is improved thermal conduction. The metal package removes heat generated during the operation of the device more efficiently than plastic or ceramic packages. The improved heat dissipation is due to both the improved thermal conduction of the metallic components and the ability of the components to disperse heat laterally along all surfaces of the package. The improved thermal dissipation permits encapsulation of 

more complex and higher power integrated circuit devices than is possible with plastic or ceramic packages.As the integrated circuit devices become more complex, more electrical interconnections with external circuitry and with other integrated circuit devices is required. The leadframe which electrically interconnects the device to external circuitry is usually manufactured from a copper base alloy having a thickness of from about 0.13mm to about 0.51mm (5-20 mils). Due to stamping and etching constraints, the minimum width of each lead, as well as the spacing between lead is about equal to the thickness of the leadframe. As a result, there is a limit on the number of leads which may approach the integrated circuit device. __An additional limitation is lead length. As the integrated circuit devices become more powerful and operate at higher operating speeds, the time for an electronic signal to travel from one device to the next limits the speed of the electronic assembly (such as a computer) . When a single device is encapsulated in each electronic package, the electronic signal must travel from the device, through a bond wire, through a leadframe,
