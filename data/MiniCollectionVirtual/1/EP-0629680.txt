<ABSTRACT>
Durene is separated in high purity from coal tar or petroleum fractions by 
an adsorptive chromatographic process run in liquid phase with lithium-exchanged 

X zeolite as the adsorbent and with liquid aromatic desorbents. High purity durene 
can be used to make pyromellitic dianhydride which in turn can be used to make 

high perforamnce advanced polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention belongs is the solid bed 
adsorptive separation of durene. More specifically, the invention relates to a process 
for separating durene from a coal tar distillate or an alkylate stream containing 
substituted benzene hydrocarbons boiling in the same range. Durene (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl benzene) in purified form is in 
substantial demand as an intermediate for a variety of uses, for example, synthetic 
polymers, e.g., coatings for semiconductors, fibers, plastomizers, organic synthesis, etc. 
Readily available sources of durene are coal tar distillates or fractions resulting from 
catalytic processing of petroleum and alkylation of o-xylene. Normally, purification 
is accomplished by re-crystallization of a fraction having a narrow boiling point range 
and/or melting point but a large number of theoretical stages is required. According 
to Chartov et al, durene could not be separated from its isomers by adsorption on 
zeolites (Chem. Abstract 92 (7):58328d (1972)), since the difference in critical 
diameters between the isomers is too small. US-A-3,864,416, disclosed that 2,4,5-trimethylcumene can be separated 
from mixtures of tetra-alkyl-substituted benzenes with X or Y zeolites exchanged with 
Group I-A metals, particularly sodium, potassium and cesium. However, the 
2,4,5-trimethylcumene is rejected while the other isomers are selectively adsorbed. 
In the present invention, durene is unexpectedly selectively adsorbed by 
lithium-exchanged X zeolite, whereas zeolites exchanged with ions other than lithium 
reject durene as might be expected from the teachings of this '416 patent.  US-A-4,743,708 discloses a process for separating a C10 aromatic 
isomer, particularly paradiethylbenzene from a feed stream of C10 aromatic isomers 
by contacting the stream with the adsorbent, zeolite beta. It is also stated that 
durene is preferentially adsorbed over prehnitene and isodurene. However, the 
patentees do not teach applicants' separation with a lithium-exchanged zeolite. 
Patentee preferred sodium as the ion exchange cation. However, sodium-exchanged 
X zeolite, was unsatisfactory in applicants' separation, for the reason that durene and 
isodurene were coextracted and, hence, no separation was obtained. A specific adsorbent lithium-exchanged X zeolite has now been found 
which, in combination with certain aromatic desorbent liquids, will selectively adsorb 
durene from a mixture with its isomers. The present invention is a process for separating durene from a heavy

<CLAIMS>
A process for separating durene from a heavy gasoline fraction 
hydrocarbon mixture comprising durene, isodurene, prehnitene and other 

polyalkylated monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons boiling in the range from 150 to 
225째C, said process comprising contacting said mixture at adsorption conditions with 

an adsorbent consisting essentially of an X zeolite exchanged with lithium cations at 
exchangeable sites thereby selectively adsorbing said durene thereon, removing the 

non-adsorbed isomers of durene and said other polyalkylated monocyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons from contact with said adsorbent and desorbing said durene with a 

liquid aromatic desorbent having a boiling point at least 5째C higher or lower than the 
boiling point range of said hydrocarbon mixture. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein said hydrocarbon mixture comprises 
durenes and polymethyl substituted benzenes derived from petroleum or coal tar. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein said adsorption and desorption 
conditions include a temperature within the range of from about 80째C to 220째C and 

a pressure sufficient to maintain liquid phase. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein said desorbent is selected from the 
group consisting of 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, toluene, p-xylene, 

m-xylene, chlorobenzene and benzene.
