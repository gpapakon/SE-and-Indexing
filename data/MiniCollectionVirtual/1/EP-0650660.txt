<ABSTRACT>
Distributor machines for the discharge of distribution materials, such as seed, fertiliser or the like, are to ensure that the arable area to be cultivated is covered with distribution material as uniformly as possible. Difficulties of this kind always arise at the beginning and end of the discharge of the distribution material if a relatively long pneumatic conveying stage is provided between the supply container (21) and the spreaders (61), so that time delays occur. On the other hand, however, the supply container (21) is to be provided in such a way that its load is distributed non-uniformly, for example to a ground-working machine. Provision is therefore made for the switching of the drive for the requisite metering device (25) located on the supply container (21) to be not necessarily linked to the position of the spreaders. According to the invention, it can take place either arbitrarily directly on the drive or else via the likewise arbitrarily adjustable position, uncoupled from the position of the spreaders, of the measuring sensor (5) for the movement of the entire machine, the measuring sensor (5) being arranged in the vicinity of the spreaders (61).

A distributor for delivering material such as seeds, fertiliser or the
like to an area of arable land used for agriculture or forestry,

being installable on a tractor (1) and/or a tractor-drawn soil-cultivation
machine (3) and having the function of distributing the

preferably granular material over the area of arable land, wherein
the distributor (2) comprises a storage hopper (21) for the

material, spreaders (61) for the material raisable out of their
operating position, in particular seed drills or fertiliser spreaders,

and a metering device (25) driven by a controllable electric drive
for the metered pneumatic supply of the material from the storage

hopper (21) to the associated spreaders (61) via a supply line (23),
and wherein the speed of and/or the distance covered by the

spreaders (61) is detected by a measuring sensor (5), and the
measuring signals thus obtained are used to control the drive for

the metering device (25) in order to ensure uniform distribution of
the material over the entire area of arable land, characterised in

that the measuring sensor (5) is arranged in the region of the
spreaders (61), and the drive of the metering device (25) is

independent of whether or not the spreaders (61) are in their
operating position, and in that the drive is connectable as

required both directly and via the measuring sensor. 
A distributor according to claim 1, characterised in that the
arrangement is such that the measuring sensor (5) is activated or

deactivated when the spreaders (61) are moved into or out of their
operating position.
A distributor according to claim 1, characterised in that the
arrangement is such that the measuring sensor (5) is activatable

or deactivatable as required, in particular irrespective of whether
the spreaders (61) are moved into or out of their operating

position.
A distributor according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the measuring sensor (5) is formed as a measuring wheel

which rests against the ground and is drivable by the latter.
A distributor according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the measuring sensor (5) is arranged downstream of the

spreaders (61) in the direction of travel (A).
A distributor according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the measuring sensor (5) is arranged laterally to and

slightly downstream of the spreaders (61) in the direction of travel
(A).
A distributor according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised

in that at least one distributor head (24), to which at least one
pneumatic supply line (23) for the material from the storage

hopper (21) leads and to which each spreader (61) is
pneumatically connected by at least one separate feeder (62) for 

the material, is provided between the storage hopper (21) and the
spreaders (61).
A distributor according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that the drive for the metering device (25) comprises an electric

motor and a transmission.
A distributor according to claim 8, characterised in that the
electric motor is connected as required directly or indirectly via

the measuring sensor (5).
A distributor according to claim 8, characterised in that the
transmission is engaged as required directly or indirectly via the

measuring sensor (5).
A distributor according to claim 9 or 10, characterised in that the
speed of the electric motor and the transmission are controlled by

the measuring sensor (5).
A distributor according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that a
marker is provided which, on meeting the beginning or the end of

the area of arable land to be treated, serves as an indication to
switch the drive for the metering device (25) on or off and which is

mountable on the tractor (1) or the soil-cultivation machine (3).
A distributor according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised
in that a switching device for the metering device (25) is provided

in the working area of the operator, and in that an associated
indicator signals to the operator a preset time period starting from

the time of activation or deactivation of the metering device (25), 
the arrangement being such that, in the time interval between

activation of the metering device (25) and subsequent starting of
the tractor (1), or deactivation of the metering device (25) and

subsequent stopping of the tractor (1), the material is supplied at
a constant, for example average speed.
A distributor according to any one of claims 1 to 13, characterised
in that a further measuring sensor is arranged in the region of the

distributor head (24) or at least one spreader (61) and detects the
beginning or the end of the flow of material in the spreader (61)

and signals this to the operator by means of an associated
indicator, the arrangement being such that, in the time interval

between activation of the metering device (25) and subsequent
starting of the tractor (1), or deactivation of the metering device

(25) and subsequent stopping of the tractor (1), the material is
supplied at a constant, for example average speed.
