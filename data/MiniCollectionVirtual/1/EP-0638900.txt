<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for reproducing data
stored on a disc, a signal processing circuit for use in
processing data read from a rotating disc for storage in a
buffer memory and a method for reproducing data stored on
disc as defined in the preamble of claim 1, 13, 24. Such an
apparatus, such a circuit and such a method are known from
EP 0 485 234 A2. In Fig. 7 of this document a circuit is
shown which converts a frequency of 4.3218 Mhz into a
frequency of 4.2336 Mhz. The writing operation of digitized
and demodulated data to a storing means is carried out
dependent on these frequencies.DE 41 03 973 A1 discloses a method for reproducing and for
recording of digital data. For avoiding interruptions during
a data reproduction, data from a recording carrier are read
out via an intermediate memory. When trouble occurs, no data
are read any more into the intermediate memory due to
tracking and focusing defects. After the trouble disappears,
the data are read into the intermediate memory at a higher
speed, such that the intermediate memory is again filled up
with data.As is well known in the field of audio equipment, digital
record reproducing systems have been generally adopted for the
purpose of reproducing recorded data of high density and high
fidelity. In these systems, audio analog signals are converted
into digitized data by a PCM(Pulse Code Modulation) technique and
this data is recorded on a recording medium, such as a disc or a
magnetic tape, to be reproduced. Among these systems, the compact
disc is mainly used at present. In this case, a binary digit(bit)
corresponding to the digitized data is formed on a disc of about
12cm in diameter, and is optically read.A reproducing device for reproducing the data recorded on
the compact disc as described above, moves an optical pickup  
provided with a semiconductor laser and a photo-electric conversion
device in a constant linear velocity tracking system(CLV)
from the inner periphery side to the outer periphery side of the
disc, and by rotating the compact disc the data recorded on the
compact disc may be read.The data read out from the disc is supplied to an RF circuit.
This RF circuit extracts a focus error signal and tracking
error signal from an output of the optical pickup, and supplies
a servo control circuit with these extracted signals. The RF circuit
also quantizes the signal read from the disc, and supplies a
signal processing circuit with the quantized signal as an eight
to fourteen bit modulated(EFM) signal. This signal
