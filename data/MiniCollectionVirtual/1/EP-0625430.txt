<ABSTRACT>
A binary image comprises a plurality of first areas, at which a porous or 
particulate image-forming substance is adhered to a substrate, and a plurality of second 

areas, at which the substrate is free from the image-forming substance, is protected by 
laminating thereto a laminating sheet comprising a durable layer and a support layer with 

the durable layer facing the image, so that the durable layer adheres to both the first and 
second areas of the image. The support layer is then displaced away from the image 

such that the durable layer remains attached to the image. The durable layer is 
substantially transparent and comprises a polymeric organic material having incorporated 

therein a siloxane, the siloxane being incorporated into the polymeric material in such 

a manner that it is not removed therefrom by hexane, isopropanol or water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a protected image and a process for the 
production of such an image. WO-A-88/04237 (and the corresponding EP-A-349 532) describe a 
thermal imaging medium and a process for forming an image in which a layer of a 
porous or particulate image-forming substance (preferably, a layer of carbon black) is 
deposited on a heat-activatable image-forming surface of a first sheet-like or web 
material (hereinafter the "first sheet element"), the layer having a cohesive strength 
greater than its adhesive strength to the first sheet-like element. Portions of this 
thermal imaging medium are then exposed to brief and intense radiation (for example, 
by laser scanning), to firmly attach exposed portions of the image-forming substance to 
the first sheet element. Finally, those portions of the image-forming substance not 
exposed to the radiation (and thus not firmly attached to the first sheet element) are 
removed, thus forming a binary image comprising a plurality of first areas where the 
image-forming substance is adhered to the first sheet-like element and a plurality of 
second areas where the first sheet-like element is free from the image-forming 
substance. Hereinafter, this type of image will be called a "differential adhesion" 
image. In a preferred embodiment of the imaging medium described in the 
aforementioned International Application, the image-forming substance is covered with 
a second laminated sheet-like element so that the image-forming substance is confined 
between the first element and this second element. After imaging and separation of the 
unexposed portions of the image-forming substance (with the second element) from 
the first element, a pair of images is obtained. A first image comprises exposed portions of image-forming substance 
more firmly attached to the first element by heat activation of the heat-activatable 
image-forming surface. A second image comprises non-exposed portions of the 
image-forming substance carried or transferred to the second sheet element. The respective images obtained by separating the sheets of an exposed 
thermal imaging medium having an image-forming substance confined therebetween  
 
may exhibit substantially different characteristics. Apart from the imagewise 
complementary nature of these images and the relation that each may bear as a 
"positive" or "negative" of an original, the respective images may differ in character. 
Differences may depend upon the properties of the image-forming substance, on the 
presence of
