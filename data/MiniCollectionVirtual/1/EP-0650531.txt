<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a novel process and device for applying liquids (e.g. dyes) to the surface of leather or similar flat materials. According to the invention, a moving, open-pored, mesh-like belt (sieve) is displaced approximately parallel to leather moving on a substrate, the pores or meshes being filled with liquid. Said liquid is transferred to the leather surface by the action of pressure. The pressure can be applied via a pressure roller, a rotating brush or a linear stream of air or steam. The quantity of liquid (dye) applied is very advantageously determined by controlling the relative speed between the leather surface and the mesh-like belt (sieve). The process operates with minimum liquid (dye) losses and does not pollute the ambient air (environment).
