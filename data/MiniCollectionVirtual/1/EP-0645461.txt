<ABSTRACT>
A workpiece (44) is heated by first forming an ionized 
gas plasma (38) around the workpiece (44). A positive potential 

is applied to the workpiece (44) to accelerate electrons (50) 
from the plasma (38) into the workpiece (44). The workpiece 

(44) is uniformly surface heated by the energy directed into 
the workpiece (44) by the electrons (50). The workpiece (44) 

is cooled by providing a flow of a pressurized liquid material 
such as carbon dioxide having a triple point. The liquid material 

is expanded through a nozzle to form solid particles that contact 
the surface of the workpiece (44) and remove heat from it by 

sublimation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the heat treating of 
materials, and, more particularly, to techniques for 
rapidly and selectively heating and cooling in 
production heat treatment operations. One of the most important characteristics of 
many commercial metallic alloys is their capacity for 
property modification by heat treatment. The basis 
of heat treatment is the existence of various 
strength modifying mechanisms such as precipitation 
hardening and phase transformations such as the 
formation and modification of martensites. 
Workpieces made of such alloys may be modified 
throughout their volumes or only at their surfaces, 
as needed for particular applications. From a 
knowledge of the various mechanisms, the properties 
of such alloys may be modified over wide ranges by 
the choice of a heat treatment. Heat treatment generally involves controlled 
heating and cooling of a workpiece. The result of 
the heat treatment of a workpiece of a particular 
composition depends upon a number of parameters such 
as the temperatures selected, heating and cooling 
rates, times at temperatures, the use of multiple 
heating and cooling steps and cycles, and other 
process parameters. Some of the commercially most important heat 
treatments are performed to modify only the surface 
regions of the workpiece. For example, many steels 
are specially treated to preferentially harden their 
surfaces to improve their wear resistance, while 
maintaining an interior of high toughness and  
 
fracture resistance. Where only the surface of the 
workpiece is to be treated, the depth of penetration 
of the heated and cooled region into the workpiece 
and the temperature profiles during the heat 
treatment are of particular concern. These 
parameters are often determined at least in part by 
the shape of the workpiece and the presence of 
irregularities such as sharp points or recesses at 
its surface. Because heat treatment is so important to the 
most desirable utilization of many materials, many 
different types of heat treatment apparatus and 
methods have been developed. One commonly used 
approach is to heat the workpiece in a furnace heated 
by gas or electrical elements. After the workpiece 
has been at the required temperature for the required 
time, it may be cooled at any of several cooling 
rates, ranging from very slow furnace cooling to gas 
cooling to a rapid water quench. This technique 
processes the entire object at once, but can be very 
inefficient due to the slow heatup and/or cooling of 
the workpiece. In
