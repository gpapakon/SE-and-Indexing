<ABSTRACT>
A cutting tool (10) has cutting teeth (16) attached 
to a base surface (14). Each tooth (16) is provided with 

a generally vertical leading face (20) that is arranged 
at an angle (β) relative to a forward stroke direction 

(24) of the cutting tool, and a corresponding, similarly 
shaped trailing face (22) relative to said forward stroke 

direction. Extending between the leading face and the 
trailing face is at least one cutting surface (26) 

perpendicular to the leading face. The cutting surface 
has an elongated, generally linear crest (28) having a 

length ("a") that extends between the leading and trailing 
faces and is situated at a distance ("b") from the 

base surface. Each leading face forms a piercing corner 
(30) with the crest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates primarily to the 
design and use of cutting and abrading tools and 
particularly to the shape of the cutting teeth and their 
edge orientation on the base surface of the tool. Presently, the base surface of many cutting tools 
designed and in use for machining, abrading and texturing 
of elastomers and other non-metallic and composite 
materials are covered with either various non-oriented 
hard, abrasive, monolayered grits, or with solid or 
structured conical or pyramidal points. For example, 
U.S. Patent No. 3,918,217 describes various means to 
magnetically structure grits of various kinds into 
conical shaped teeth. U.S. Patent No. 4,916,869 describes 
molding of grits into various pyramidal, conical 
and other shaped armorings. Sharp, acute-angled conical or pyramidal tooth 
points as are previously known are weak and tend to break 
off easily or wear too rapidly. Thus, tool life is 
relatively short. Further, as the peaks of these teeth 
become worn, the resultant workpiece surface texture 
changes and eventually becomes unacceptable. Moreover, 
these pointed tooth designs tend to leave grooved 
patterns on and into the workpieces; hence the teeth must 
be frequently truncated by dressing to a common cutting 
circle, configuration or plane to reduce the inherent 
grooving. However, truncation increases the width of the 
tooth which greatly increases friction-caused heat. Additionally, all such pointed tooth shapes 
inherently cause a great increase in friction-caused heat 
because of the rubbing of the rake surfaces against the 
portion of the workpiece which is not cut away by the 
tooth point or truncated edge. This friction-caused heat  
 
causes smoke and scorching to the workpiece. The adverse 
effects of the friction-caused heat becomes increasingly 
severe when mechanically working plastics, all elastomers 
and other like hydrocarbon materials and composites 
thereof which are resilient and inherently more sensitive 
to heat. Monolayered grits and patterns of such grits usually 
have inherent truncated, generally obtuse-angled teeth 
and edges. While stronger and more wear-resistant, these 
edges cause even greater amounts of friction, and 
increased energy is used and wasted as frictional heat 
to the tool and to the workpiece. This often tends to 
scorch or burn the workpiece surface and produces 
objectionable smoke and other undesirable effects to the 
workpieces such as scorch to elastomers. Extensive evaluations have been made of the 
aforementioned
