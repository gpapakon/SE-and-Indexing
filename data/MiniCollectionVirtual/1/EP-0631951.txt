<ABSTRACT>
Device for lifting drums (2) and similar objects, which 
device (5) comprises: a lifting arm (8); at least two substantially 

parallel and horizontally extending beams (11, 
16), which are supported by the lifting arm; means for 

supporting the beams (11, 15, 16) relative to the lifting 
arm (8) such that at least one of the beams is moveable 

substantially in a horizontal direction and at right angles 
to its longitudinal direction, and means (13), such as in 

the form of air bellows (13), for moving the beams (11) 
towards each other and, eventually by means of springs, from 

each other; and means (9, 10) for displacing the lifting arm 
(8) in vertical and horizontal directions. One or more beams 

can be divided in parts (16). The beams are lined with a 
flexible material (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device as described in the
preamble of claim 1.Such a device is known by DE-A-3702708. This known device
comprises a frame two opposite parts of which are provided
with beams which can be brought towards and away from each
other. To prevent that drums, being clamped between said
beams, will move along said beams, said beams are provided
with supports extending substantially transverse to said
beams. Owing to this the device is only suitable for lifting
drums with a given diameter. Further said drums have to be
positioned in such a way that when three or more rows of drums
are present between the two beams the drums of an intermediate
row will have to be nestled among the drums of the adjacent
rows. An even number of more than two rows can not be lifted
at all. So the utility of said known device is limited.Now the object of the invention is to provide a device
for lifting drums which is more universally useful.According to the invention this object is obtained by
applying the features indicated in the characterizing portion
of the main claim.By making use of four beams which each are supported by a
part of the surrounding frame and which beams are surrounding
the drums to be lifted it is possible to clamp a number of
drums very firmly.EP-A-0142420 describes a device for lifting bottles which
device comprises a rectangular frame supporting four beams
which are movable in respect of said frame. Said frame, however,
is positioned at some distance above said beams and in
use it is positioned above the bottles to be lifted. The means
for moving the beams in respect to said frame being positioned 
above and across the frame and being very complicated in
construction. So in particular in vertical direction the
device will comprise much more space than the device according
to the present invention.To take account of deviations in the configuration of a
number of drums, it can be provided that at least one of the
beams is divided into a number of separate parts.According to an embodiment of the device according to the
invention two opposite beams are spaced in vertical direction
in respect of the other pair of beams. The distance has to be
only so large that two opposite beams may move over the other
pair of beams. This can be useful if only a limited number of
drums has to be lifted at once.According to a further embodiment of the device according
to the invention at least one or some of said beams or of said
beam parts are guided flexible in respect of said frame, the
means for

<CLAIMS>
Device for lifting drums (2) and similar objects, comprising
a frame (8) which by lifting means (9,10) is movable in

vertical direction and comprises at least two oppositly positioned
longitudinal parts extending in substantially horizontal

direction, means (13) being connected to said parts to support
beams (11,15,16) in such a way that by said means at least

some of said beams can be moved in respect of said frame (8)
and towards and away from each other in a substantially horizontal

direction for clamping drums or the like between them,

characterized in that
 said frame (8) has a rectangular
shape and is formed by four longitudinal mutually connected

parts which are lying in substantially the same horizontal plane,
each of said parts supporting at least one beam (11,15,16),

said beams being positioned inside said frame (8), at least
two adjacent beams (11,15,16) being movable substantially in

the same horizontal plane as in which said frame (8) is positioned.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 two
opposite beams (11,16) are spaced in vertical direction in

respect of the other pair of beams (15).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

at least one or some of said beams (11, 15) or of beam parts
(16) are guided flexible in respect of said frame (8), the

means for displacing said beams being formed by air bellows
(13), electrical means or such like.
