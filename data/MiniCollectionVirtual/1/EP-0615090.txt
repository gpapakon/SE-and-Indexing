<ABSTRACT>
A tube connecting device includes a first tubular 
connector (20) and a second tubular connector (30) 

which extends into the first connector (20) and which 
is formed with an annular peripheral groove (31) that 

is registered with a pair of radial openings (23) in 
the first connector (20). Each of a pair of press arms 

(40) has one end mounted pivotally to the first 
connector (20) adjacent to a respective one of the 

radial openings (23) and formed with a cam face (42). 
Each of the press arms (40) is pivotable to a locking 

position in which the cam face (42) thereof extends 
into the peripheral groove (31) via the respective 

radial opening (23) so as to press against the second 
connector (30). Each of a pair of retaining units (50) 

includes a positioning rod (51) which is provided 
slidably in a positioning bore (44) that is formed in 

an inner side of a respective press arm (40). A biasing 
unit (54) biases the positioning rod (51) so that an 

end portion (53) of the latter engages a respective 
retaining seat (25) which projects outwardly from the 

first connector (20) when the respective press arm (40) 
is in the locking position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tube connecting device, 
more particularly to an improved tube connecting device 
which can be easily installed and which provides firm 
and stable connection between two tubes. A conventional tube connecting device comprises 
first and second tubular connector members, each of 
which is connected to one end of a corresponding tube. 
The first connector member has a receiving end portion 
formed with two opposite radial openings. The second 
connector member extends into the receiving end portion 
and has an outer surface which is formed with an 
annular peripheral groove that is registered with the 
radial openings. The tube connecting device further 
includes a pair of press arms, each of which having one 
end mounted pivotally to the first connector member and 
formed with a cam face. When the press arms are pivoted 
to a locking position, the cam faces extend into the 
peripheral groove via the respective radial opening so 
as to press against the second connector member at the 
peripheral groove, thereby securing the second 
connector member to the first connector member. Note that in the above described conventional tube 
connecting device, the pressing force that is applied 
by the cam faces is used to secure the second connector 
member to the first connector member. However, no 
retaining device is provided so as to prevent untimely  
 
movement of the press arms. Therefore, untimely 
disengagement between the cam faces and the peripheral 
groove can occur, thereby resulting in the untimely 
disengagement of the first and second connector 
members. In order to overcome the above mentioned drawback, 
the construction of the conventional tube connecting 
device has been modified as follows: The first 
connector member is provided with a pair of opposite 
retaining projections. Each of the retaining 
projections is formed with a longitudinal through bore. 
Each of the press arms is provided with an opening to 
permit a corresponding one of the retaining projections 
to extend therein when the press arms are in the locked 
position. Each of the press arms is further provided 
with a hook end and a fastening ring on the hook end. After the press arms have been pivoted to the 
locking position, one end of each of the fastening 
rings is then extended into the through bore of a 
respective one of the retaining projections, thereby 
retaining the press arms on the first connector member 
so as to prevent untimely movement of the former. Note that although untimely movement of

A tube connecting device including 

a first tubular connector member (20) having a 
receiving end portion (21) formed with a pair of 

opposite radial openings (23) and an extension end 
portion (28) to be connected to a corresponding tube; 
a second tubular connector member (30) having an 
insert end portion (301) which extends into said 

receiving end portion (21) and an engaging end portion 
(32) to be connected to a corresponding tube, said 

insert end portion (301) having an outer surface which 
is formed with an annular peripheral groove (31) that 

is registered with said radial openings (23); 
a pair of press arms (40), each having one end 
mounted pivotally to said first connector member (20) 

adjacent to a respective one of said radial openings 
(23) and formed with a cam face (42), each of said 

press arms (40) being pivotable to a locking position 
in which said cam face (42) thereof extends into said 

peripheral groove (31) via the respective said radial 
opening (23) so as to press against said second 

connector member (30) at said annular groove (31) in 
order to secure said second connector member (30) to 

said first connector member (20); 
characterized by: 
a pair of retaining seats (25), each of which 
projecting outwardly from said first connector member  

 
(20) and being disposed below a respective one of said 

radial openings (23), each of said retaining seats (25) 
having an inwardly and downwardly inclined side surface 

(27) and a bottom formed with a vertical blind bore 
(26); 
each of said press arms (40) having an inner side 
which is formed with a longitudinal positioning seat 

(43), said positioning seat (43) being formed with an 
axial positioning bore (44) which is aligned with said 

blind bore (26) in a respective one of said retaining 
seats (25) when said press arm (40) is in said locking 

position; and 
a pair of retaining units (50), each of which 
including: a positioning rod (51) being provided 

slidably in said positioning bore (44) of a respective 
said positioning seat (43) and having first and second 

end portions which extend out of said positioning bore 
(44); a biasing unit (54) being disposed in said 

positioning bore (44) of said respective positioning 
seat (43) and biasing said positioning rod (51) so that 

a tip of said first end portion (53) is displaced 
normally from a pivoting axis of a respective said 

press arm (40) by a distance (L) equal to that between 
a plane lying on said inclined side surface (27) of a 

respective said retaining seat (25) and said pivoting 
axis of said respective press arm (40); and a pull ring 

(56) secured on said second end portion of said  
 

positioning rod (51); said first end portion (53) 
extending into said blind bore (26) of said respective 

retaining seat (25) when said respective press arm (40)
