<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical seal assembly having a rotatable seal ring connected to the shaft and a non-rotatable seal ring connected to the housing. A cylindrical drive ring encircles the rotatable seal ring and an annular shroud is mounted to the cylindrical drive ring and extends from it terminating in an annular lip that is disposed in contacting relationship with the rotatable seal ring adjacent the seal face of the rotatable seal ring. The shroud may be provided with a plurality of circumferentially spaced slots. Means are also provided for moving the end of the shroud toward the non-rotatable seal ring when the shaft moves toward the non-rotatable seal ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to high 
pressure mechanical seal assemblies. High pressure mechanical seal assemblies are 
used with nuclear reactor coolant pumps, boiler 
recirculating pumps, boiler feed pumps and pipeline pumps 
to meet the requirements for extreme and widely changing 
conditions of pressures and temperatures encountered in 
these uses. Examples of such seal assemblies are 
disclosed in US-A-4 586 719 to Marsi et al. which 
issued May 6, 1986 and US-A-5 076 589 to Marsi 
which issued December 31, 1991. A mechanical seal assembly usually includes the 
combination of a rotatable seal ring connected to a 
rotatable shaft for rotation with the shaft and a non-rotatable 
or stationary seal ring connected to a flange of 
a housing. Each seal ring has a radially disposed seal 
face and the seal faces oppose each other. There is 
usually a film of fluid between them, providing 
lubrication for the rotation of one of the faces. In many 
seal assemblies, one or more coil springs urge one of the 
rings toward the other, so that in reality, one or both of 
the seal rings are capable of limited axial movement, even 
though they are commonly referred to as "stationary" or 
"rotatable." Multiple stage seal assemblies comprising a 
plurality of seal assemblies are known in the art.  
 The stationary and rotatable seal rings are 
typically made of different materials. In some 
applications, the stationary seal face is carbon graphite 
and the rotating seal face is a harder material such as 
tungsten carbide, silicon carbide or the like. Silicon 
carbide is sometimes preferred over tungsten carbide 
because it is a harder material having a longer life span. 
It also causes less wear to the carbon graphite stationary 
seal face and does not corrode as much as tungsten 
carbide. One drawback to the use of silicon carbide is 
that it has a relatively low impact strength, causing it 
sometimes to chip or shatter if a sudden load is applied 
to it. Thus, in the case of mechanical seal assemblies 
used for nuclear service, special care must be given to 
properly enclose a seal ring made of silicon carbide. 
This is because a shattered seal ring could have serious 
consequences if the broken pieces were permitted to escape 
from the seal assembly into the reactor system possibly 
causing damage, plugging or jamming of components. A previous method used to secure the rotatable 
seal ring to the shaft was by shrink fitting a cylindrical 
member to the outside of the seal ring. The shrink fit 
member also

<CLAIMS>
A mechanical seal assembly (10) for separating 
a high pressure fluid (21) and a low pressure fluid 

(23), and associated with a rotatable shaft (12) and a 
stationary housing (16), said assembly comprising a 

rotatable seal ring (20) having a radially-disposed seal 
face (24); a non-rotatable seal ring (22) connected to 

the housing (16), said non-rotatable seal ring (22) 
having a radially-disposed seal face (26) disposed in 

facing relationship with the seal face (24) of the 
rotatable seal ring (20); and a cylindrical ring (42) 

connected to the shaft (12), the cylindrical ring (42) 
encircling the rotatable seal ring (20) and drivingly 

connected thereto; the rotatable seal ring (20) having 
an exposed portion (72) extending axially out of the 

cylindrical ring (42) towards the non-rotatable seal 
ring (22); characterized by an annular shroud (76, 80) 

mounted to and extending from the cylindrical ring (42) 
toward the seal face (24) of the rotatable seal ring 

(20), the shroud (76, 80) extending axially substantially 
the full axial length of the exposed portion of the 

rotatable seal ring (20) to a location closely adjacent 
the seal face (24) of the rotatable seal ring (20) to 

enshroud the rotatable seal ring (20) and keep it 
together if it shatters; the annular shroud (76, 80) being 

disposed relative to the rotatable seal ring (20) so as 
not to produce any significant radially directed contact 

forces between the shroud (76, 80) and the rotatable seal 
ring (20) during normal operation of the mechanical seal 

assembly (10). 
A mechanical seal assembly as claimed in claim 
1, wherein the shroud (76, 80) terminates in an axially-extending  

 
annular lip (74, 86) disposed in contacting 

relationship with the rotatable seal ring (20). 
A mechanical seal assembly as claimed in claim 
1 or claim 2, wherein the shroud (76) defines a 

plurality of circumferentially spaced slots (78) 
configured to reduce the radial contact force between 

the shroud (76) and the rotatable seal ring (20). 
A mechanical seal assembly as claimed in any 
of the preceding claims, wherein the shroud (76), during 

an overload condition caused by axial movement of the 
shaft (12), is axially moveable relative to the 

rotatable seal ring (20) toward the non-rotatable seal 
ring (22). 
A mechanical seal assembly as claimed in any 
of the preceding claims, wherein the shroud (76), during 

an overload condition caused by axial movement of the 
shaft (12), is axially moveable relative to the 

rotatable seal ring (20) into contact with the non-rotatable 
seal ring (22). 
A mechanical seal assembly as claimed in any 
of the preceding claims, wherein the exposed portion 

(72) of the rotatable seal ring (20) defines an 
unnotched outwardly facing cylindrical surface extending 

axially from the seal face (24) of the rotatable seal 
ring (20) and an unnotched
 inwardly facing cylindrical 
surface extending axially from the seal face (24) of the 

rotatable seal ring (20). 
A mechanical seal assembly as claimed in any 
of the preceding claims, wherein the annular shroud (76)  

 
is not in rotating driving contact with the rotatable 

seal ring (20). 
A mechanical seal assembly as claimed in any 
of the preceding claims, further comprising elastomeric 

means (44) drivingly connecting the rotatable seal ring 
(20) to the cylindrical ring (42). 
A mechanical seal assembly as claimed in any 
of the preceding claims, wherein the cylindrical ring 

(42) has an axially extending groove (41) and a wall 
(43) at one end of the groove, the assembly further 

comprising a sleeve (18) connected to the shaft, the 
sleeve having a groove (40); and a drive pin (38) 

disposed between the axially extending groove (41) and 
the sleeve groove (40) for connecting the cylindrical 

ring (42) to the shaft sleeve (18) such that an axial 
movement of the shaft (12) causing the rotatable seal 

ring (20) to shatter will cause the drive pin (38) to 
engage the wall (43) of the cylindrical ring (42) 

pushing the shroud (76) into contact with the non-rotatable 
seal ring (22) to prevent shattered pieces of 

the rotatable seal ring (20) from falling out of the 
assembly.
