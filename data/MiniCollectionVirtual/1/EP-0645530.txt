<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an internal combustion engine with an air intake system for passing combustion air to at least one cylinder space, the said system comprising one or more intake pipes (1 - 4) twisted through more than 180 DEG  and means for the control variation of the effective intake-pipe length and which has at least one throttling element which can be moved in a controlled manner, the means for varying the intake-pipe length and the throttling element for controlling the air flow are combined structurally in an approximately cylindrical drum-type rotary slide (17) which can be rotated in a controlled manner about a cylinder axis (18) and can be displaced, likewise in a controlled manner, to a limited extent in the direction of the cylinder axis (18).

Internal combustion engine with an air intake system for 
passing combustion air on to at least one cylinder chamber, 

which consists of one or more intake pipes (1-4; 25) 
twisted through more than 180Â° and means for controlled 

variation of the effective intake pipe length and also 
includes at least one choke member of controlled mobility, 

characterised in that the means for varying the intake pipe 
length and the choke member for air quantity control are 

structurally combined in a more or less cylindrical rotary 
roller slide valve (17; 26) which is rotatable about its 

cylinder axis (18; 28) in controlled fashion and slidable 
in the direction of the cylinder axis (18; 28) to a limited 

extent also in controlled fashion. 
Internal combustion engine with an air intake system 
according to claim 1, characterised in that control of the 

effective intake pipe length in a manner known in the art 
takes place by rotation of the rotary roller slide valve 

about its cylinder axis and air quantity control is to be 
performed by linear sliding of the rotary roller slide 

valve, wherein the rotary roller slide valve is of hollow 
cylindrical construction, provided at the circumference 

with an opening for each intake pipe and forms a boundary 
wall of the intake pipes encompassing it in some regions. 
Internal combustion engine with an air intake system 
according to claim 1, characterised in tha
t two-stage 
control of the effective intake pipe length takes place by 

linear sliding of the rotary roller slide valve (17) into 
one of two possible positions and air quantity control is 

to be performed by limited rotation of the rotary roller 
slide valve (17), wherein the rotary roller slide valve 

(17) comprises two transverse channels (19, 20) which in  
 

one position of the rotary roller slide valve (17) form 
sections of a loop (9-12) of the intake pipe (1-4) and 

wherein the rotary roller slide valve (17) comprises an 
additional transverse channel (21) which in the other 

position of the rotary roller slide valve (17) bridges the 
loop (9-12) of the intake pipe (1-4). 
Internal combustion engine with an air intake system 
according to claim 1, characterised in that two-stage 

control of the effective intake pipe length takes place by 
rotation of the rotary roller slide valve (26) into one of 

two possible positions and air quantity control is to be 
performed by limited sliding of the rotary roller slide 

valve (26), wherein the rotary roller slide valve (26) 
comprises a transverse channel (29) which in one position 

of the rotary roller slide valve (26) forms a section of a 
loop (27) of the intake pipe (25), and in the rotary roller 

slide valve (26) is provided an additional branched 
transverse channel (30) which in the first position of the 

rotary roller slide valve (26) also forms a section of the 
loop (27) of the intake pipe (25) and in a second position 

of the rotary roller slide valve (26) by the branch (33) 
bridges the loop (27) of the intake pipe (25). 
Internal combustion engine with an air intake system 
according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the loop 

(9-12; 27) of the intake pipe (1-4; 25) is closed on at 
least one side by the rotary roller slide valve (17; 26) 

when the rotary roller slide valve (17; 26) is in the 
position bridging the loop. 
Internal combustion engine with an air intake system 
according to any of claims 3 to 5, characterised in that 

the transverse channels (19, 20, 21; 29, 30) do not  
 

intersect with each other and are arranged approximately 
transversely to the cylinder axis (18; 28) in the rotary 

roller slide valve (17; 26). 
Internal combustion engine with an air intake system 
according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 

the cylinder axis (18; 28) of the rotary roller slide valve 
(17; 26) is more or less perpendicular to planes defined by 

the loops (9-12; 27) of the intake pipes (1-4; 25). 
Internal combustion engine with an air intake system 
according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that 

only one rotary roller slide valve (17; 26) is provided for 
each internal combustion engine. 
Internal combustion engine with an air intake system 
according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 

adjusting means (23) are connected to the rotary roller 
slide valve (17; 26) and the position of the rotary roller 

slide valve (17; 26) can be fixed by the adjusting means 
(23) as a function of predetermined nominal values and 

operating parameters of the internal combustion engine.
