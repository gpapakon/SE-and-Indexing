<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method to connect and disconnect a voltage source and an electric apparatus, such as a television set or a similar apparatus, which takes on a stand-by state or a similar operating condition, in which a connecting device is arranged in the power supply connection and in such a way that when the value of the supplied current or the power dissipation related to it are below a preset value, a relay device is acted upon in such a way that it interrupts the connection to the power supply and the voltage source is disconnected. Further, the invention relates to a device for the realization of said method where said device is mountable on the power supply connection of the device and that it contains a relay device (5) or a thermostat (5), which is arranged so as to sense the value of the supplied current (I1) or a power dissipation related to the current, where the relay device (5) or the thermostat (5) when the current level or its related power dissipation level are below a predetermined value, interrupts the connection to the power supply, such that the voltage source is disconnected and that for the connection of the voltage source, the relay device (5) or the thermostat (5) is arranged in such a way that when the current level exceeds another predetermined value it closes the connection to the power supply.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device to connect and disconnect a voltage source to an electric
apparatus, such as a television set or a similar apparatus, which takes on a stand-by state or
a similar operating condition.Modern television sets are mostly equipped with a remote control device and can be
set into the three different operating states "off', "stand-by" and "on". Picture and sound
are presented in the "on" state.Television sets of this type are often left in the stand-by state during the whole day, and the
stand-by state is indicated by a lit red light emitting diode (LED). The LED light is
intended to remind the user to turn off the television set at night, hereby from a safety point
of view, to separate the television set from the mains supply.The primary intention with the stand-by state is to preheat the glow wire of the picture tube
so that the picture appears rapidly after the television set has been turned on. Secondly,
the remote control function gets its power supplied. However, the power consumption
of the stand-by state is 10 - 20 W and there is a statistically significant risk of the television
set catching fire. Hence, users are recommended to turn the television set off completely
during the night and when they are not at home for a long time, e.g. during vacations.Further, a reflection of light could be misinterpreted as a remote control command and
could bring the television set into the "on" state unintentionally. Strangers could turn on the
television set too, through a window with any type of general remote control device.Many users leave the television set in the stand-by state and never turn it fully off. Suppose
that the television set is in the stand-by state during 20 hours every day and that the power
consumption is 10 W, then the television set wastes 75 kWh per year. The total wasted
power consumption in one million television sets will be 10 MW and with an unfortunate
pulsed current wave form from the power utility point of view. Hence, several power plants
in every country are fully occupied just supplying unused television sets with power. The 
wasted production value to keep television sets in a stand-by state may be as large as 20
million US dollars a year in Sweden alone.It is important to eliminate the stand-by state as an increasing number of television sets with
remote control and stand-by state function grow older. These sets face an increasing risk of
catching fire.In CH-A-609 500 is presented an apparatus for disconnecting a load from a power supply
when

<CLAIMS>
A device for arrangement in the power supply path between a voltage source and an electric
apparatus, such as a television set or a similar apparatus which may take on a stand-by state or a

similar operating condition, the device including:

means (11;15), inserted in said supply path, for determining the supply current (11) or power
delivered to said electric apparatus;
first switch means (6,7), having a switch contact inserted in said supply path in series with said
means (11; 5) for determining , and being controlled by said means for determining for

interrupting supply of power from said voltage source to said means for determining and
to said electric apparatus when the level of said supply current or power decreases below a

first predetermined value;
means (8,9,10; 8,6,7) for forcing re-establishing power supply from said voltage source to said
means (11; 5) for determining, said means for re-establishment consisting of either


an actuator (8) for enabling manually forcing said first switch means (6,7) into a
closed state, or
second switch means (8,9,10) having its contacts arranged parallel to those of
said first switch means (6,7) and being mechanically actuatable for enabling

manually forcing re-establishment of said power supply to said means for
determining;

wherein said means (5; 11) for determining controls said first switch means (6,7) to re-establish
power supply to said electric apparatus when the determined supply current or power delivered to

said electric apparatus exceeds a second predetermined level.
The device according to claim 1, wherein when said means for forcing re-establishing power
supply consists of said second switch means (8,9,10), said first switch means (6,7) is formed by

an electronic relay.
