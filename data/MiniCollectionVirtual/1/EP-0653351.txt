<ABSTRACT>
The marker light comprises a casing (12) which can be set into the ground, in which is housed a light source (22) and a cover (14) equipped with at least one opening incorporating an optical unit (18) on the front of the light source. The impermeability of the optical unit with respect to the cover is ensured by a seal (20) the shape of which substantially matches that of the periphery (18c) of a base part of the optical unit and which is compressed by means of a presser element (26) applied against a lower surface of the optical unit. The cover (14) affords a housing provided for the seal defined by contact surfaces comprising a wall (14a) facing the periphery of the optical unit and an upper abutment (14b) for the seal (20) parallel to the central plane of the cover. The periphery of the optical unit (18) is shaped to act on the seal (20) in the manner of a wedge so that the seal is compressed against the contact surfaces (14a, 14b) under the action of the presser element (26), the seal being produced from a material capable of flowing under a compression stress so as to fill in the space (24) between the periphery (18e) of the optical unit and the opposite wall (14a).

A beacon light fixture for aircraft runways or taxiways
comprising a pod (12) that can be embedded in the ground, a light source

(22) situated inside the pod, a cover (14) closing the pod and provided with
at least one opening, and an optical unit (18) co-operating with the light

source and mounted in the opening of the cover in sealed manner via a
sealing gasket (20) interposed therebetween, the gasket being of a shape

that substantially matches that of a perimeter (18e) of a base portion of the
optical unit, and being compressed by means of a presser member (26)

applied against a bottom surface of the optical unit, the light fixture being
characterised in that:


the cover (14) provides a seat for the gasket (20), with the
contact surfaces of said seat that are in contact with the gasket being

defined by a wall (14a) facing the base portion of the optical unit (18) and an
inner rim (14b) situated at the top portion of this wall, the inner rim (14b)

forming an abutment for the gasket parallel to the general plane of the
cover; and in that
the base portion of the optical unit (18) forms a wedge which
compresses the gasket (20) in its seat under the force from the presser

member, the gasket being made of a material capable of exhibiting creep
under compressive stress so as to fill the gap (24) between the base portion

(18e) of the optical unit and the facing wall (14a).
A light fixture according to claim 1, characterised in that the
contact surfaces (14a, 14b) defining the seat for the sealing gasket (20) in

the cover (14) are machined respectively perpendicularly and parallel to the
general plane of the cover.
A light fixture according to any one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the sealing gasket (20) is made of an elastomer

material.
A light fixture according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the base portion of the optical unit has a shoulder

(18d) which acts against a bottom surface portion of the sealing gasket (20)
in order to urge the gasket against the contact surfaces (14a, 14b) of the

cover.
A light fixture according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the top of the sealing gasket (20) is extended by a 

peripheral sealing lip (32) situated between the perimeter of the optical unit
(18) and a facing wall of the cover that surrounds the opening in the cover.
A light fixture according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the optical unit comprises two prisms mounted side by

side and the sealing gasket (20) is configured like a figure "8" in plan-view,
with a central branch (20b) thereof being inserted between the two prisms.
A light fixture according to claim 6, characterised in that the top
of the central branch (20b) of the gasket is extended by lips (34), each

situated between an internal reflection face (18b) of a prism and a facing
wall of the cover (14).
A light fixture according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the presser member (26) bears against a bottom

surface of the optical unit (18) via a force-transmission plate (28).
