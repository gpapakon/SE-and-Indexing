<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a sealing device for a valve stem controlled by a cam contained in a camshaft casing of an internal combustion engine having at least one cylinder. The device according to the invention includes a duct (10) connecting, on the one hand, a pipe (2) for the intake of the carburated fuel into a combustion chamber (1) this pipe being closed off by a valve (5) and, on the other hand, a camshaft casing (4). A non-return valve (11) is placed in the said duct (10) so as to divide the said duct (10) into two volumes (12, 13), the first volume (12) being connected to the casing (4) and constituting a pressurised capacity which has a pressure P1 greater than or equal to the pressure P2 prevailing in the intake pipe (2) and in the second volume (13). The device according to the invention is intended to prevent oxidising air from leaking from the intake pipe (2) into the camshaft casing (4).

Sealing device for a valve rod controlled by a 
cam contained in a cam shaft housing of an i
nternal 
combustion engine having at least one cylinder, 

characterised in that it has a pipe (10) linking a passage 
(2) for feeding a carburetted mixture into a combustion 

chamber (1), closed off by a valve (5), on the one hand, 
and a cam shaft housing (4) on the other, the device 

having in addition a non-return valve (11) positioned in 
the said pipe (10) in order to divide the said pipe (10) 

into two volumes (12, 13), the first volume (12) being 
linked to the housing (4) and forming a capacity under 

pressure having a pressure P1 greater than or equal to the 
pressure P2 prevailing in the inlet passage (2) and in the 

second volume (13), the said device being designed to 
prevent fuel leakage from the inlet passage (2) to the cam 

shaft housing (4). 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the second volume (13) is linked to 

a crankcase of a cylinder of the internal combustion 
engine. 
Sealing device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the second volume (13) is linked to 

a compressor external to the cylinder. 
Device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the inlet channel (2) is 

supplied with compressed air and has a pneumatic fuel 
injector so that the said valve (5) acts as a pneumatic 

injector for spraying the said fuel into the combustion 
chamber (1).
