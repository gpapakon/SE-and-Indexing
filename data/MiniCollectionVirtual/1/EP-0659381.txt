<ABSTRACT>
The operational process includes a step in which water is 
let into a receiving sump (5) up to a static level (L), said 

water being then sprayed onto the washload through appropriate 
spray means (8, 13) that are supplied by a pump (7) having a 

suction mouth (11) whose top portion is situated at a level 
(H). The water is sprayed in an intermittent manner through a 

sequence of alternating spray periods (T) and pause periods 
(Tp) during which the pressure of the water downstream of the 

pump (7) is at its maximum (P1) and at its minimum (Pm), 
respectively. Each spray period (T) has a duration which is 

equal to the time needed for the water in the sump (5) to sink 
from the static level (L) to the level (H) of the pump suction 

mouth (11). Each pause period (Tp) has a duration that is 
equal to the time needed for the water in the sump (5) to 

rise again from the level (H) up to the static level 
(L).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an improved type of 
operational process capable of being implemented in an 
automatic dishwashing machine. Automatic dishwashing machines are commonly known to be 
provided with a programme sequence control arrangement, either 
of an electromechanical or an electronic type, which is 
adapted to control the main operating organs of the machine so 
as to enable pre-determined operational processes of the 
machine to be performed in the way that will have been 
appropriately set in advance by the user. In particular, such 
operational processes consist usually of one or several 
successive steps which can be selectively included in or 
excluded from a given process. A traditional operational 
process would basically include a main washing phase, at least 
a rinse phase, and a final drying phase. Each one of these washing and rinsing phases are known to 
be usually performed by first letting from the delivery mains 
into the washing tank of the machine an amount of water which, 
as appropriately enriched through the addition of detergent or  
 
rinse aid, as the case may be, can then be heated up to a 
respective pre-established temperature, is sprayed onto the 
washload by means of rotating spray arms that are supplied by 
a circulation pump, and is eventually let off the machine tank 
into the drain. In general, said afore mentioned amount of water filled 
into the machine tank is substantially the same for all of the 
phases included in the operational process, and it shall 
further be adequately large so as to not only ensure a 
correct priming of the circulation pump, but also enable each 
single item in the washload to be properly sprinkled and 
wetted, said washload being appropriately arranged in support 
baskets placed one above another inside the tank of the 
machine. In view of cutting the overall water usage and, as a 
consequence, the overall energy consumption, a proposal has 
been set forth in the Italian patent application no. PN91 A 
000071 filed on Oct. 22, 1991 to spray the water onto the 
washload, during the rinsing phase, at a reduced pressure with 
respect to the pressure used during the washing phase. This, 
in an advantageous manner, enables a reduced amount of water 
to be used during the rinsing phase, thereby bringing about a 
corresponding energy saving effect. On the other hand, it is not possible to achieve such an 
advantageous energy saving effect during the washing phase, as 
it would on the contrary be quite desirable. A quite drastic

Operational process for a dishwashing machine comprising 
a washing phase and/or at least a rinse phase, each one of 

said phases being controlled by a programme sequence control 
apparatus (14) and including in turn the inlet of water into 

the collecting sump (5) of the machine up to a static level 
(L), said water being sprayed onto the washload by means of 

spraying means (8, 13) supplied by a circulation pump (7) 
having a suction mouth (11) the top portion of which is 

arranged at a pre-determined level (H) in the sump, said water 
being sprayed by said spraying means in an intermittent 

manner, with an alternating sequence of spraying periods (T) 
and pauses (Tp) during which the pressure of the water 

downstream of the pump (7) is at its highest value (P1) and 
its lowest value (Pm), respectively, 
characterized in that
 
each one of said spraying periods has a duration (T) which is 

substantially equal to the time taken by the water in the sump 
(5), due to its being drawn in by the pump (7) and delivered 

in the tank by said spraying means (8, 13), to 
lower from said static level (L) down to said pre-determined 

level (H) of the pump suction mouth (11). 
Operational process according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 each one of said pauses has a duration (Tp) which is 
substantially equal to the time taken by the water in the sump  

 
(5), in which the water suspended in the tank of the machine 

collects by gravity, to rise from said pre-determined level 
(H) to said static level (L). 
Operational process according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 said lowest pressure (Pm) during said pauses (Tp) is 
substantially nil. 
Operational process according to claim 1, wherein said 
circula
tion pump (7) is connected through a water delivery 
circuit with said spraying means (8, 13), 
characterized in 
that
 said lowest pressure (Pm) during said pauses (Tp) has 
such a value (P2) as to maintain said water delivery circuit 

(12, 8, 13) at least partially filled with water, so as to 
minimize the related hydraulic noise generated when the water 

in the circuit changes to its highest pressure (P1) during 
said periods (T).
