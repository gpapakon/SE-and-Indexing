<ABSTRACT>
The process essentially consists in carrying out, 
successively, the following main operations :

 
- to manufacture a sintered substratum ( 12 ) which 

consists of a first metallic material with pores occupied 
by a second metallic material ( 10 ) . 

 
- to lay at least one part of the sintered substratum 

(12) with a predetermined amount of a third pulverized 
"noble" metallic material ( 13 ); and

 
- to sinter the predetermined amount of the third 

material until a required degree of porosity is 
obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process to manufacture 
a sintered metallic product and to the product thus 
obtained. Particularly, but not exclusively, the aforesaid 
invention consists of a lifter head for an internal 
combustion engine. Preferably, lifter heads consist of a first base material 
layer which, in use, is joined to a respective shank by 
means of a conventional operation ( welding, brazing, 
mechanical junction, etc. ) and of a second layer, bound 
up with the first layer, which consists of a material so-called 
"noble" owing to its particular resistance to the 
abrasion resulting from the percussion, rolling and slip 
stresses owing to the cam which, in use, acts upon 
it. Processes ( plasma spray, transferred arc plasma, laser 
alligation, etc. ) able to lay a base metallic material 
substratum with a layer of "noble" metallic material are 
known. Although widely used, these processes are not without 
drawbacks. Actually the "noble" material laid onto the 
metallic substratum is prevented from undergoing the 
thermal contraction during the temperature decreasing  
 
phase. Thereof it is subject to internal tensile stresses 
and consequently susceptible of cracking. It is known from the document GB-A-544 903 a process of 
manufacturing a continuous strip of sintered materials, 
including the steps of diffusing into a porous matrix a soft 
metal powder. The strip is firstly rolled by pressure rollers 
and then heated in a furnace to cause the metal powder 
to melt and to flow into the pores of the matrix. The molded 
article is a porous strip of soft metal. It is also known form the document WO-A-83/04382 a process 
of making a wear resistant ferrous part, provided with wear 
surfaces formed of a diluted aqueous slurry of wear resistant 
particles deposited into the pores of the part, which 
are finally dried. The object of the present invention is to conceive a process 
and to manufacture a product able to obviate the aforesaid 
drawbacks of the known processes and products. Said object is attained according to the present invention 
by a process to manufacture a sintered metallic product 
having at least a portion subject to abrasion stresses, 
comprising the following operations: 
providing a porous matrix by compacting premixed iron-based 
powders as to form a housing corresponding to said  
 
portion and laterally delimited by a projecting part; filling said housing with a layer of metallic material 
capable of diffusing into said porous matrix at the sintering 
temperature of

A process to manufacture a sintered metallic product 
having at least a portion subject to abrasion stresses, 

comprising the following operations: 

providing a porous matrix (7) by compacting premixed 
iron-based powders (3) as to form a housing (8) corresponding 

to said portion and laterally delimited by a projecting 
part (9); 
filling said housing (8) with a layer of metallic 
material (10) capable of diffusing into said porous matrix 

(7) at the sintering temperature of said porous matrix (7); 
sintering said porous matrix (7) and said layer (10) 
at said temperature until the material of said layer (10) is 

completely diffused into the pores of said porous matrix 
(7), thus obtaining a Substratum (12) substantially deprived 

of porosity; 
depositing in said housing (8) a predetermined amount 
of a powder metallic material (13) resistant to abrasion 

stresses; 
compacting said amount of powder metallic material 
(13) till obtaining therein a predetermined degree of porosity; 

and 
sintering said amount of powder metallic material 
(13) so compacted to form a filling (16) in said housing (8) 

adhering to said substratum (12).

said layer of metallic material (13) is in form of compacted 

copper.  
 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
said layer of metallic material (13) is in form of a mixture 

of copper-based powders. 
A process as claimed in claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the sintering of said porous matrix (7) and said layer 

of metallic material (10) is effected at a temperature of 
about 1120Â°C and in presence of hydrogen.

in that said powder metallic material (13) is compacted 

in a support body (1, 14) including a mold (1) and a countermold

out by substantially keeping said support body (1, 14) 
at a temperature identical to the temperature of said filling
