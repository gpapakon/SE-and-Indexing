<ABSTRACT>
The integrated transmission line structure comprises 
a substrate (1) having alternating grooves (12) and 

projections (11). Transmission lines (2) are formed on the 
projections, and may also be formed in the grooves. Due to 

separating adjacent transmission lines by a distance (A) 
greater than the horizontal distance (B) between them, 

cross-talk characteristics of the transmission lines are 
improved. 
The substrate can be engaged with an encapsulating 
substrate (3), having a shape complementary to that of the 

substrate and provided with a conductor layer, so as to 
further improve the shielding between adjacent transmission 

lines. 
The structure can be incorporated with a chip carrier 
or multi-chip module.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transmission lines 
formed on a surface of a substrate of integrated circuits, 
and more specifically to parallel signal transmission lines 
formed on a recessed surface of the substrate to reduce 
cross-talk between neighboring transmission lines. In general, as active and passive elements in high 
density integrated circuits become increasingly smaller, a 
spacing between neighboring transmission lines becomes 
increasingly narrower. This results in cross-talk, i.e. a 
signal carried on a line leaks to the neighboring 
transmission line by electrostatic coupling between the 
lines. The electrostatic coupling also increases with 
higher frequency of signals on the line. Thus, the cross-talk 
has become progressively an unavoidable obstacle to 
develop higher-speed and higher-packing density integrated 
circuits. Particularly, in a recent optoelectronic multi-chip 
module, parallel electric signal transmission lines are 
often aligned with parallel optical fibers. Each of these  
 
transmission lines is connected with each element of an 
array of light emitting or receiving diodes formed on a 
single chip carrier. Since the denser array of light 
emitting or receiving elements requires the narrower spacing 
between neighboring electric transmission lines, the cross-talk 
between these narrow-spacing parallel transmission 
lines becomes severer particularly to high-frequency 
signals. A typical optoelectronic multi-chip 
module, which comprises an array of optoelectronic devices, 
parallel signal transmission lines , bonding wires 
connecting the optoelectronic devices with the electric 
transmission lines, a chip carrier , and an array of 
parallel optical fibers mounted on an array of 
the optoelectronic devices . Since the electric 
transmission lines are formed on a planar surface of the 
chip carrier with the same spacing as that between the 
optoelectronic devices , a static capacitance between the 
electronic transmission lines can not be reduced without 
the sacrifice of the optimized geometrical arrangement. A 
wider spacing between the lines resulting in a low cross-talk 
requires non-parallel extended bonding wires as well as 
a large amount of wasted chip area. Thus, both reduction 
of the cross-talk and the chip area at the same time is  
 
not possible in the prior art. It is therefore desirable to provide high packing 
density integrated circuits having parallel signal 
transmission lines with low cross-talk. It is also desirable to provide an
