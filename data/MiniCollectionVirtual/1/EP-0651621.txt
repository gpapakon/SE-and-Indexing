<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hinge devices for securing the 
corresponding seat and lid to water closet pans. For this purpose it is known to use two hinge devices fixed to the 
upper rear part of the pan, each of them comprising a single pin 
by which the device is hinged both to the lid and to the seat. Single hinge device for securing the lid and seat to 
a water closed pan, where the lid and seat rotate 
around two different axis is disclosed in EP-A-0225427 
(cf. the preamble of claim 1). Said device comprises a first part with a first 
portion to be fixed in a position in the vertical 
plane of symmetry of the pan and a second portion, 
joined to the first portion; second parts to be fixed 
to the lid and having their rear edge hinged to the 
second portion of the first part by two first pins of 
horizontal axis; the seat having its rear end hinged 
to the second portion of the first part by two second 
pins of horizontal axis, said second pind lying in a 
position lower and to the front of the first pins.  
 The object of the present invention is to improve said known 
securing devices in such a manner as to satisfy the following 
various requirements: that the hinge device be a single device to 
be fitted in a position in the vertical plane of symmetry of the 
pan, that it be able to simultaneously secure the seat and lid to 
the pan, and that it be of particularly pleasing appearance. This object is attained by the device of the 
invention as defined in claim 1. Prefered embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims. The invention is described in detail hereinafter with reference to 
the accompanying figures, which illustrate one embodiment thereof. Figure 1 is a section on the vertical plane of symmetry of the 
device of the invention, shown fitted to a pan, a seat and a lid. Figure 2 is a perspective view of the hinge device of Figure 1. The hinge device of the invention, indicated overall by 1 in the 
figures, is intended to be fixed to a water closet pan 5 in a 
position in the vertical plane of symmetry of the pan 5, and acts 
as the only securing means for the lid 6 and seat 7. The device 1 comprises a first part 10 with a first portion 11 of 
plate form to be fixed onto the upper rear surface 50 of the pan 
5, and a second portion 12 joined to the first portion 11. The device 1 also comprises a second part 20 of plate form to be  
 
fixed to the lid 6, and a third part 30, also of plate form, to be 
fixed to the seat 7. The second part 20 has its rear edge hinged 
to the

<CLAIMS>
Hinge device suitable for singly securing a seat 
(71) and lid (6) to a water-closet pan (5) comprising 

a first part (10) with a first portion (11) to be 
fixed in a position in the vertical plane of symmetry 

of the pan (5) and a second portion (12), joined to 
the first portion characterized by comprising a single second part (20) of plate form 

to be fixed to 
the lid and having their rear edge hinged to the 

second portion (12) of the first part (10) by a single first 
pin (13) of horizontal axis; 

a third part (30) of 
plate form to be fixed to the rear end of the seat (7) and having its 

rear edge hinged to the second portion (12) of the 
first part (10) by a single second pin (14) of horizontal 

axis, said second pin (14) lying in a position lower and 
to the front of the first pin (13).  

 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that: 

said second portion (12) of the first part (10) comprises two 
opposing vertical walls (121), external to which there project the 

end portions of said two pins (13 and 14); 
said second part (20) and third part (30) each comprise, on 
their rear edge, two rearwardly projecting flanges (21, 31) which 

embrace the second portion (12) of the first part (10) and 
comprise the
 seats for receiving said end portions of the two pins 
(13 and 14). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that: 

said second part (20) is of flat plate form and is fixed with 
its lower face (22) against the upper surface (61) of the lid (6); 
said third part (30) is in the form of a plate bent to L-shape 
and is fixed with the upper face (32) of its end portion against 

the lower surface (71) of the seat (7); 
covers (17, 25, 35) are provided to cover the upper face (16,  
 

26) of the first part (10) and second part (20) and the lower face 
(36) of the third part (30). 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that said 
second portion (12) of the first part (10) comprises a first 

upwardly extending projection (12') defining the seat for the 
first pin (13), and a second horizontally forward extending 

projection (12'') defining the seat for the second pin (14), the 
first projection (12') joining the second projection (12'') at a right 

angle.
