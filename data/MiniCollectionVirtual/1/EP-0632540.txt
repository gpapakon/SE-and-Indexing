<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switched outlet
having an operating handle which moves from the off
position to the on position even when no plug is received
within the outlet. When a plug is not inserted into the
outlet receptacle, the operating handle is effectively
disengaged from the switch actuating mechanism by a clutch
such that operation of the handle does not activate the
switch and does not energize the outlet terminals. The
clutch controls whether the operating handle movement moves
or does not move the mechanical switch actuating mechanism
to avoid excess force being applied to the mechanical
switch actuating mechanism. Conventional safety switched outlets with dead fronts
include a mechanical linkage interlocking the electrical
receptacle and the switch. The linkage provided prevents
the switch handle from being moved to an on position unless
a plug is fully inserted in the electrical receptacle.
Because the mechanical linkage prevents movement of the
switch handle to the on position when no plug is in the
receptacle, excessive force used in attempting to move the
handle can break or bend the mechanical linkage, thereby
damaging the outlet mechanism.The disadvantage of these conventional mechanically
interlocked systems is that users attempt to force movement
of the handle to the on position, risking damaging the
outlet mechanism. To avoid this problem, the outlet
mechanism and components are usually made to be very strong
to withstand the abuse. However, increasing the strength
of the components is costly, makes the mechanism more
difficult to operate, and is not always successful.
Typical examples of conventional mechanically interlocked
switched outlets which would cause linkage damage upon
operation of the switch handle without a plug inserted in
the receptacle are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,241,828
to Reynolds and U.S. Patent No. 4,604,505 to Henninger.U.S. Patent No. 4,506,121 to Peterson discloses a
mechanically interlocked switch outlet with a mechanism for
preventing overloading of the switched linkage due to
improper switch handle operation when a plug is not
inserted in the receptacle. Such mechanism permits the
handle to move from the off position to the on position
without the plug being located within the electrical
receptacle and without such handle movement actuating the
switch or circuit breaker. In each of the several
embodiments disclosed in the Peterson patent, a spring is 
provided in the mechanism which transmits force between the
handle and the switch actuating
