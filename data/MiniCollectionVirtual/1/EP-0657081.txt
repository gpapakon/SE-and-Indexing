<ABSTRACT>
The user software for controlling connections in communications system must be uncoupled from the hardware architecture of the communications system. A switching control system is disclosed which represents an autonomous system for controlling connections on the physical plane and which allows the user systems to formulate their connection requests in an independent manner from the hardware architecture of the communications system.

<CLAIMS>
Switching control system (PSS) for controlling
the physical connection structures in a switching system,

which comprises the following features:

a) means for receiving connection requests from at
least one user system (CCS, ITP, SIG), the user

system being used to control the logic connection
structures, and a connection request containing

identifiers for the connection end points affected
by it,
b) means for processing the said connection requests,
which means calculate a physical path through the

switching networks of the switching system on the
basis of a connection request,
c) means for transmitting commands to resource systems
(RHS) for local control of the resources which are

affected by the calculated physical path.
Switching control system according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that the means for processing the connection requests
from a user system process received connection requests

independently of one another.
Switching control system according to Claim 1 or
2,

characterized by

means for transferring the data of the physical path
which is set by the resource systems to the user system

which submits the connection request.
Switching system which comprises the following
features: 


a) at least one control processor (GP) for carrying out
central control processes,
b) at least one user system (CCS, ITP, SIG) per control
processor (GP) for central control of the logic

connection structures,
c) local resource systems (RHS) for local control of
the resources of the switching system,

characterized by

d) one and only one switching control system (PSS) per
control processor (GP) for central control of the

physical connection structures in the switching
system, which comprises the following features:


d1) means for receiving connection requests from a
user system (CCS, ITP, SIG), a connection request

containing identifiers for the connection end
points affected by it,
d2) means for processing the said connection
requests, which means calculate a physical path

through the switching network of the switching
system on the basis of a connection request,
d3) means for transmitting commands to local resource
systems (RHS) for local control of the resources

which are affected by the calculated physical
path.
Switching system according to Claim 4,

characterized

in that

a) a user system (CCS, ITP, SIG) is built up from a
plurality of segments,
b) each segment autonomously carries out a subfunction
of the logic connection controller.
Switching system according to Claim 5,

characterized

in that

a) one chain of entities of the required segments is
built up per connection,
b) a plurality of entities of the said chain are able
to submit mutually independently produced connection 

requests to the switching control system (PSS),
c) the said chain of a connection can extend over a
plurality of control processors (GP).
Switching system according to Claim 6,

characterized

in that the said user system includes a coordination
system (LSS) which coordinates the said connection

requests with respect to the switching control system
(PSS) in such a manner that, at a specific time, only one

consistent connection request is in each case dealt with
per connection by the switching control system (PSS).
