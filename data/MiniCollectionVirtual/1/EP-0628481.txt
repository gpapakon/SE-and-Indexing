<CLAIMS>
Device for the emptying of containers which contain 
powdery materials, through an orifice (4) located in 

the base region of a lateral wall (5), in which device 
an air inlet pipe (2) enters at a distance from the 

end of a pipe (1) through the wall of the latter for 
the purpose of withdrawing the powdery material by 

suction, and the air inlet pipe (2) is arranged in the 
pipe (1) in such a way that its air outlet (3) is 

coaxial with the pipe (1) in the direction of the 
interior of the pipe, with the opening (13) of the 

pipe, which is adjacent to the air outlet (3), having 
an edge, whereof the plane surface encompassed by the 

edge forms an angle of less than 90Â° with the axis of 
the pipe (1), with the open side pointing upwards. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
air outlet (3) is arranged within a cross-sectional 

constriction of the pipe (1).
