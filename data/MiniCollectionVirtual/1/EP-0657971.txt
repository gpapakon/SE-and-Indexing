<ABSTRACT>
An electrical terminal applicator (10) is 
provided for crimping terminals (24) onto wires (90), the 

terminals being secured to a tape (26) in a side-by-side 
relationship with their axes extending laterally of the 

tape. An applicator ram (14) is drivable in a first path 
(A) for moving a crimping die (18, 20) toward and away from 

a crimping anvil (22). A track (32) guides the tape in a 
second path (B) which generally intersects the first path 

of the ram. The track includes a platen (34) and a guide 
plate (36) which define a pair of opposing clamping jaws 

for engaging and gripping opposite surfaces of the tape and 
pulling the tape laterally of the second path thereof. The 

tape is moved relatively away from the crimping die when in 
crimping condition with the anvil and in engagement with a 

crimped terminal, to break the terminal away from the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical terminal applicators and, particularly, to an
improved means for moving the tape laterally of its feed
path away from a crimping die to break a crimped terminal
away from the tape.It is now commonly known in the art of crimped
electrical terminals to provide many types of crimpable
terminals on a continuous tape of thin material such as
plastic. The terminals are suitably secured to the tape in
a manner such that they can be fed to a crimping apparatus,
and the leading terminal of the tape is crimped onto a wire
after which it is removed from the tape. The present
invention relates to an improved applicator for crimping
electrical terminals on such a tape and particularly to an
improved tape moving means.A known type of electrical terminal applicator
includes an applicator ram drivable by a press ram through
a working stroke towards, and a return stroke away from, a
crimping anvil. The applicator ram has a first crimping
die for cooperation with the anvil to crimp a first portion
of an electrical terminal onto an exposed end of a
conductive core of an insulated electrical wire during each
working stroke of the applicator ram. The applicator ram
has a second crimping die for cooperation with the anvil to
crimp a second portion of the terminal onto the insulation 
of the electrical wire during each working stroke of the
applicator ram. The second crimping die is adjustable
axially of the applicator ram. Plate means are mounted for
angular adjustment about an axis on, and extending
lengthwise of, the applicator ram. The plate means
selectively interpose first projections between the press
ram and the applicator ram to adjust the shut height of the
first and second dies, and selectively interpose second
projections between the applicator ram and the second
crimping die to independently adjust the shut height of the
second die.In this known type of terminal applicator, tape
feeding means are provided for feeding the terminal tape
toward the crimping die to sequentially advance a leading
uncrimped terminal on the tape, in response to a working
stroke of the applicator ram. For instance, one type of
feeding means comprises one or more sprocket wheels or a
conveyor tape having teeth which are adapted to enter
indexing apertures in the terminal tape.Still further, the applicator may include tape
moving means for moving the tape relatively away from the
crimping die, laterally of the feed path of the tape, when
the die is in crimping condition and in

An electrical terminal applicator (10) for crimping
terminals (24) onto wires (90), the terminals being

secured to a generally planar tape (26) in a side-by-side
relationship with their axes extending laterally of

the tape, said tape having opposite surfaces with a
plurality of openings (30) extending therebetween to

facilitate feeding of the tape (26),

an applicator ram (14) drivable in a ram path (A)
through a working stroke towards, and a return stroke

away from, a crimping anvil (22),
a crimping die (18, 20) on the applicator ram for
cooperation with the anvil to crimp a portion of a

terminal (24) onto a wire (90) during each working
stroke of the ram,
track means (32) for guiding the tape in a tape feeding
path (B) which generally intersects the ram path (A),
tape feeding means (48, 70) for engaging said openings
(30) in the tape (26) to feed the tape along the tape

path (B) to sequentially advance a leading uncrimped
terminal (24) on the tape, in response to reciprocation

of the ram (14),
tape moving means (34, 36, 100) for moving the tape (26)
relatively away from the crimping die (18, 20) when the

die is in crimping condition and in engagement with a
crimped terminal (24) to break the crimped terminal away

from the tape,

characterized in that

said tape moving means (34, 36, 100) comprises tape
clamping means (34, 36) for engaging and gripping

opposite surfaces of the tape (26) and pulling the tape
laterally of said tape feeding path. 
The electrical terminal applicator as set forth in claim
1, wherein said tape clamping means (34, 36) include at

least part of said track means (32).
The electrical terminal applicator as set forth in claim
2, wherein said track means (32) include a platen (34)

which defines said tape feeding path (B) and a guide
plate (36) juxtaposed above the platen, the guide plate

and the platen defining opposing clamping jaws which
form said tape clamping means (34, 36).
The electrical terminal applicator as set forth in claim
3, wherein at least one of the platen (34) and the guide

plate (36) include a tape engaging surface (108) which
is serrated to enhance the gripping capability thereof.
The electrical terminal applicator as set forth in claim
3 or 4, including biasing means (92, 96) operatively

associated between the applicator ram (14) and the guide
plate (36) for moving the guide plate (36) into clamping

condition relative to the platen (34) as a function of
the working stroke of the ram (14).
The electrical terminal applicator as set forth in any
of claims 3 to 5, including a piston and cylinder device
