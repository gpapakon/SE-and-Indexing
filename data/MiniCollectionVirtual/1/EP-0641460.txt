<DESCRIPTION>
 Organometaliic Monomers And Polymers With Improved AdhesionTechnical Field This invention relates to organometaliic complex-containing monomers and polymers, and to their uses as adhesive primers, protective coatings, and release coatings in both imaged and non-imaged applications.Background of the Invention Coatings of polymeric materials on various substrates are of industrial significance and provide the basis for a number of products. It is generally recognized that adhesion of polymeric coatings to substrates is critically important in determining the properties and performance characteristics of a coated article. Unfortunately, the nature of adhesion between a polymeric coating and a substrate tends to be complex and often difficult to test, study, or control (Adhesion Measurement of Thin Films, Thick Films and Bulk Coatings; Mittal, K.L., Ed.; 1978, pp 5-17).One accepted method of improving the adhesion of polymers to inorganic substrates is to use silane coupling agents that contain groups reacting with inorganic surfaces as well as groups that react with the polymeric coating, Plueddemann J. Adhesion 1970, 2, 184. For example, the improved adhesion of crosslinked polybutadiene coated on glass plates treated with vinyltriethoxysilane compared to glass plates treated with ethyltriethoxysilane is illustrative of this effect, Ahagon et al. J. Polymer Science, Polymer Physics Edition 1975, 13, 1285. However, chemical application of silane coupling agents to various substrates tends to be a complex process that often requires a heat curing step. Further, it is generally difficult to limit the application of these coupling agents to selected areas of substrate, Arkles Chemtech 1977, 7, 766.
