<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a photographic 
emulsion comprising a silver halide grains containing 

at least two dopants. The dopants comprise an osmium-based 
transition metal complex containing a nitrosyl or 

thionitrosyl ligand; and a transition metal selected 
from Group VIII of the periodic table.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
emulsions. In particular, it relates to photographic 
silver halide emulsions containing dopants and having 
improved contrast. In both color and black and white 
photography, there exists the desire for products which 
exhibit increased contrast upon exposure to light and 
subsequent development. This desire is based upon the 
realization that contrast is directly related to the 
appearance of sharpness; and, it follows, that products 
which exhibit increased contrast give the visual 
impression of enhanced sharpness. Traditionally, photographers have defined 
contrast by two methods, both of which are derived from 
the D-log E curve (also known as the "characteristic 
curve"; see James, The Theory of Photographic 
Properties, 4th ed. pp 501-504). The first method is 
the determination of gamma (γ), which is defined as the 
slope of the straight-line section of the D-log E 
curve. The second is the determination of the overall 
sharpness of the toe section of the D-log E curve. By 
sharpness of the toe section, it is usually meant the 
relative density of the toe section. For instance, a 
sharp toe corresponds to a relatively low (small) toe 
density, and a soft toe corresponds to a relatively 
high (large) toe density. Generally, the point at 
which toe density is measured corresponds to 0.3 log E 
fast of the speed point, although toe density may 
properly be measured at any point prior to the curve's 
primary increase in slope. The speed point corresponds  
 
to the point on the D-log E curve where density equals 
1.0. If either the value of γ is high or the toe 
is sharp, then the image has a relatively high 
contrast. If the value of γ is low or the toe is soft, 
the image has a relatively low contrast. It is known that in attempts to maximize the 
contrast of photographic elements based on silver 
halide emulsions (as well as other characteristics of 
the photographic element), the silver halide emulsions 
have been doped with various transition metal ions and 
compounds. Dopants are substances added to the 
emulsion during silver halide precipitation which 
become incorporated within the internal structure of 
the silver halide grains. Because they are internally 
incorporated, they are distinguished from substances 
added post-precipitation such as chemical or spectral 
sensitizers. These latter compounds are externally 
associated with the surface of the silver halide grains 
and are thus more properly referred to as addenda or 
grain surface modifiers.
