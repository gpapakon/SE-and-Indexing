<ABSTRACT>
Multiphase fluid is subjected to pumping or compression or to centrifugal separation after undergoing at least partial separation in a cyclonic separator device (20; 60). The cyclonic separator device can be incorporated in a rotary pump/compressor unit having separate flow paths for fluids of different specific gravities or can constitute an inlet stage for a centrifugal separator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to treatment of a multiphase
fluid, for example, in a transport or separator system.The handling of a multiphase fluid, that is, a mixture
of at least two fluids of different phases, presents
problems arising for example from the different physical
characteristics of liquids and gases, in particular, the
virtual incompressibility of the former and the ready
compressibility of the latter, and also from variations in
the relative amounts of liquids and gases in the multiphase
fluid. For example, in oil production, a well may produce
a mixture of crude oil, crude gas, water and sand or like
particulate material. It is desirable in many instances to
place such a mixture under increased pressure, but this is
difficult because pumps with impellers designed to pump
liquid are unsuitable where the liquid contains a high gas
content. Similarly, ordinary gas compressors are unsuitable
for use where liquid is present in the gas in any
substantial amount.US 3,435,771 describes apparatus including a
pretreatment stage for separating fluids of different
specific gravities (e.g. vapour and liquid) for subsequent
separate treatment. The separation is affected by
concentrating fluids of different specific gravities into
inner and outer annular flowpaths.In accordance with the invention, there is provided an
apparatus for the treatment of a multiphase fluid, the
apparatus comprising a pretreatment stage (20;60) upstream
of a treatment stage, the pretreatment stage being arranged
to cause an incoming flow of multiphase fluid to concentrate
fluids of greater and lesser specific gravity into
respective flow paths for subsequent treatment in the 
treatment stage and the pretreatment stage comprising a
cyclonic separator device (20;60) concentrating fluid or
fluids of greater specific gravity into an outer annular
flow path around an inner flow path for fluid or fluids of
lesser specific gravity wherein the treatment stage
comprises a centrifuge having a separator drum (65)
rotatable about the axis (66) thereof with an inner end
portion juxtaposed to the cyclonic separator stage, the
inner end portion comprising concentric inner and outer
walls (76,70) and helical vanes (76) between the walls.In a preferred embodiment the invention can be used to
provide a pump/compressor unit arranged for efficient
pressurising of a multiphase fluid regardless of variations
in the quantities of gas or liquid in the fluid.A pump/compressor unit comprising multiphase fluid
treatment apparatus in accordance with the
