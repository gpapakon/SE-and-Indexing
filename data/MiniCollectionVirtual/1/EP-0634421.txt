<ABSTRACT>
In the process for polymerizing an olefin in the gas 
phase according to the present invention, an olefin is 

continuously fed to undergo a gas phase polymerization in a 
fluid bed reactor in which a metallocene catalyst is 

present. At least one compound selected from the group 
consisting of water, alcohols and ketones is added in a 

specified amount simultaneously with the feeding of the 
olefin. Thus, an olefin polymer having a satisfactory drop 

second count index as defined by the below indicated 
formula is produced.

   wherein t₀ and t respectively represent a flow time 
measured in the flow test according to ASTM D-1775 of the 

olefin polymer obtained when none of the water, alcohols 
and ketones is incorporated in the reactor, and that when 

at least one compound selected from the group consisting of 
water, alcohols and ketones is incorporated in the reactor. 
The flowability of the polymer formed in the reactor 
according to the process of the present invention is 

excellent, so that blocking, bridging and the like do not 
occur during the gas phase polymerization. Thus, it is 

feasible to stably produce a (co)polymer having excellent 
particle properties in high yield for a prolonged period of 

time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for gas 
phase polymerization of an olefin. More particularly, the 
present invention is concerned with a process for gas phase 
polymerization of an olefin, in which the olefin is 
continuously polymerized in the gas phase in a fluidized 
bed reactor having a metallocene catalyst placed therein to 
obtain an olefin (co)polymer whose flowability is so 
excellent that blocking and bridging do not occur 
in the fluidized bed to thereby ensure stable production of 
the olefin (co)polymer for a prolonged period of time. Olefin polymers, representative examples thereof 
including polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene 
(LLDPE) which is a copolymer of ethylene and an α-olefin, 
are now being widely employed as materials for forming 
films. Such olefin polymers have conventionally been produced 
by (co)polymerizing an olefin in the presence of a catalyst 
containing a solid titanium catalyst component comprising 
magnesium, titanium and halogen as essential components 
(hereinafter often referred to as "titanium catalyst")  
 
according to any of the solution polymerization, suspension 
polymerization and gas phase polymerization techniques. When the above polymerization is conducted according 
to the gas phase polymerization technique, particulate 
polymers can be obtained, so that particle precipitation 
and particle separation steps after the polymerization 
become unnecessary. Therefore, the gas phase 
polymerization process can accomplish process 
simplification and energy saving to thereby lower 
production cost. This gas phase polymerization process is a process for 
continuously (co)polymerizing an olefin, in which a solid 
catalyst and an olefin are continuously fed into a 
fluidized bed reactor to thereby polymerize or copolymerize 
the olefin in the fluidized bed and the thus obtained 
particulate polymer is continuously withdrawn. In order to ensure stable and continuous production of 
a particulate polymer according to the gas phase 
polymerization process, the reaction conditions and the 
flowability and mixing conditions of charged materials and 
product (olefin polymer) must be stabilized for a prolonged 
period of time in the fluidized bed reactor into which the 
catalyst and olefin are fed, in which the particulate 
polymer is formed, and from which the particulate polymer 
is continuously discharged. In recent years, a catalyst (hereinafter often 
referred to as "metallocene catalyst") comprising a solid  
 
catalyst component containing a
