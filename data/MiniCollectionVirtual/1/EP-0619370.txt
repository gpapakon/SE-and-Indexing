<ABSTRACT>
Based on extensive 
in vivo
 studies in animals, 
it has now been discovered that KGF stimulates 

proliferation, growth and differentiation in various 
cells of epithelial tissue, besides keratinocytes. This 

better understanding of the biological effects of KGF 

in vivo
 enables the use of this polypeptide as a 
therapeutic agent, suitably formulated in a 

pharmaceutical composition, for the specific treatment 
of disease states and medical conditions afflicting 

tissues and organs such as the dermal adnexae, the 
liver, the lung, and the gastrointestinal tract.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
application of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to
stimulate the proliferation, growth and differentiation
of cells other than keratinocytes, and to the use of KGF
to regenerate damaged or diseased cells and tissues.In recent years advances in biotechnology have
lead to the development and therapeutic use of novel
recombinant polypeptides, including erythropoietin and
granulocyte colony stimulating factor, to the benefit of
many human patients. Increasing numbers of other
polypeptides bave since been discovered which exhibit
biological activity in vitro. However, the
characterization of target cells of these factors and
the biological effects of the factors in vivo are
essential for the identification of potential
therapeutic applications in humans.KGF is a known mitogen which has been
previously identified as being specific for epithelial cells,
particularly keratinocytes. Rubin et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA, 86:802-806 (1989); Finch et al.,
Science, 245:752-755 (1989); Marchese et al., J. Cell.
Phys. 144:326-332 (1990). Expression of messenger RNA
for KGF has been detected in several stromal fibroblast
cell lines derived from epithelial tissues of embryonic,
neonatal and adult human sources, and in RNA extracted 
from normal adult kidneys and gastrointestinal tracts.
Such RNA has not been detected in glial cells, lung,
brain, or in a variety of epithelial cell lines that
included squamous cell carcinomas, mammary epithelial
cells, immortalized bronchial epithelial cells,
immortalized keratinocytes, and primary keratinocyte
cultures. Finch et al., Science, 245:752-755 (1989). However, KGF
is mitogenically active for the continuous mouse cell
line, BALB/MK cells. Weissman and Aaronson, Cell,
32:599 (1983) ; also, see Rubin et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:802-806 (1989), and Finch et al., Science, 245:752-755 (1989). This
observation supports evidence indicating a paracrine
action of KGF in the skin, with production of KGF in the
dermis (but not in the epidermis) and action on
keratinocytes.In addition, using the expression of keratins
and filagrin genes it has been demonstrated that KGF
influences the differentiation and maturation of
keratinocytes. See Marchese et. al., J. Cell Phys., 144:326-332 (1990).Much of the aforementioned work investigating
the biological activity of KGF has been carried out with
recombinant KGF, which has permitted more widespread
study of this factor. PCT patent application
