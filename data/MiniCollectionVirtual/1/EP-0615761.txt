<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable-rate flow regulator comprises a split 
housing (2) having an inverted-cup-shaped upper half (4) 

connectable to a source of liquid to be dispensed, the 
upper half having a wall and a downward-facing bottom 

surface (8) provided with an inlet port (10), and a lower 
half (16) rotatably engaging the upper half (4), the lower 

half having a neck portion (18) of reduced diameter and a 
recessed upper face (20) having, at the bottom (22) 

thereof, a control port (24) leading to the consumer of 
the liquid. The regulator further comprises an 

elastically deformable diaphragm (32) seated on an annular 
step in the recess (20) and defining with the bottom 

surface (8) of the upper housing half a first chamber 
(34), and with the bottom (22) of the recess in the lower 

housing half, a second chamber (36), and a trubular flow 
attenuator (38) made of an elastomer, rotatably seated on, 

and fluid-tightly surrounding, the neck portion (18) of 
the lower housing half (16), but non-rotatable relative to 

the upper housing half (4). The inner wall surface (44) 
of the tubular flow attenuator (38) defines in conjunction 

with the neck portion (18) a system of flow-attenuating 
ducts (48) for the liquid, the flow-attenuating effect of 

which ducts can be varied to adjust the rate of flow, 
through the regulator, of the liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flow regulator, more 
particularly to an adjustable-rate flow regulator to be used in 
an infusion set. In U.S. Patent 3,343,305, there is described an adjustable-rate, 
constant-output infusion set with, however, a rather 
limited accuracy of the flow rates obtainable. It is one of the objects of the present invention to 
provide such a flow regulator with a greatly enhanced accuracy 
and improved repeatability. According to the present invention, such a regulator is 
made possible by providing an adjustable-rate flow regulator, 
comprising a split housing having an inverted-cup-shaped upper 
half connectable to a source of liquid to be dispensed, said 
upper half having a wall and a downward-facing bottom surface 
provided with an inlet port, and a lower half rotatably engaging 
said upper half, said lower half having a neck portion of 
reduced diameter and a recessed upper face comprising, at the 
bottom thereof, a control port leading to the consumer of said 
liquid, an elastically deformable diaphragm seated on an annular 
step in said recess and defining with the bottom surface of said 
upper housing half a first chamber, and with the bottom of said 
recess in said lower housing half, a second chamber, and a 
tubular flow attentuator made of an elastomer, rotatably seated 
on, and fluid-tightly surrounding, said neck portion of said 
lower housing half, but non-rotatable relative to said upper  
 
housing half, characterized in that the inner wall surface of 
said tubular flow attentuator defines in conjunction with said 
neck portion a system of flow-attenuating ducts for said liquid, 
the flow-attenuating effect of which ducts can be varied to 
adjust the rate of flow, through said regulator, of said 
liquid. The invention will now be described in connection with 
certain preferred embodiments with reference to the following 
illustrative figures so that it may be more fully understood. With specific reference now to the figures in detail, it is 
stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and 
for purposes of illustrative discussion of the preferred 
embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in 
the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful 
and readily understood description of the principles and 
conceptual aspects of the invention. In this regard, no attempt 
is made to show structural details of the invention in more 
detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the 
invention, the description

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable-rate flow regulator, comprising: 
   a split housing having an inverted-cup-shaped upper half 

connectable to a source of liquid to be dispensed, said upper 
half having a wall and a downward-facing bottom surface provided 

with an inlet port, and a lower half rotatably engaging said 
upper half, said lower half having a neck portion of reduced 

diameter and a recessed upper face comprising, at the bottom 
thereof, a control port leading to the consumer of said liquid; 

   an elastically deformable diaphragm seated on an annular 
step in said recess and defining with the bottom surface of said 

upper housing half a first chamber, and with the bottom of said 
recess in said lower housing half, a second chamber, and 

   a tubular flow attentuator made of an elastomer, rotatably 
seated on, and fluid-tightly surrounding, said neck portion of 

said lower housing half, but non-rotatable relative to said 
upper housing half, 

   characterized in that the inner wall surface of said 
tubular flow attentuator defines in conjunction with said neck 

portion a system of flow-attenuating ducts for said liquid, the 
flow-attenuating effect of which ducts can be varied to adjust 

the rate of flow, through said regulator, of said liquid. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
flow-attenuating ducts are produced by a system of grooves 

provided in the inner wall surface of said tubular flow 
 

attentuator, which grooves, in conjunction with the surface of 
said neck portion, are turned into ducts. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
flow-attenuating ducts are produced by a system of grooves 

provided in the outer surface of said neck portion, which 
grooves, in conjunction with said tubular elastomer rotatably 

seated on, and fluid-tightly surrounding, said neck portion, are 
formed into ducts. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
ducts form a labyrinth comprised of a plurality of meanders, the 

distance between successive points of reversal of said meanders 
being constant. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
free cross-section of said ducts decreases gradually in the 

direction of liquid flow. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
free cross-section of said ducts remains constant along their 

entire extent. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
distance between said successive points of reversal increases 

gradually in direction of fluid flow. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 1, wherein the outer 
wall surface of said tubular flow attentuator is provided with 

at least one slot in an axial direction, in which slot engages 
an axially oriented rib integral with the inside wall surface of 

said upper housing half. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 1, wherein, close 
to its lower edge, the outer wall surface of said tubular flow 

attentuator is provided with a peripheral bead sealingly 
contacting the inside wall surface of said upper housing half. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
inlet port is surrounded by a rim. 
The flow regulator as claimed in claim 10, wherein said rim 
is provided with at least one notch to enable venting of air 

from the drip chamber via said first chamber and said inlet 
port, into said source.
