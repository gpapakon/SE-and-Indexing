<ABSTRACT>
A fluid droplet production apparatus, for example for use as an atomiser spraying device, has a membrane (5) which is vibrated by an actuator (7), which has a composite thin-walled structure and is arranged to operate in a bending mode. Fluid is supplied (3) directly to a surface (51) of the membrane, as fluid is sprayed therefrom on vibration of the membrane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods for 
the production of droplets of fluid, liquids or liquid 
suspensions (hereinafter called 'fluids' or 'liquids'), by 
means of an electromechanical actuator (preferably an 
electroacoustical actuator). It is known to produce fine droplet sprays, mists or 
aerosols (hereinafter called 'sprays') by the action of 
high frequency mechanical oscillations upon a liquid at its 
surface with ambient air or other gases. Prior art of 
possible relevance includes the following patent 
specifications: GB-A-2041249, US-A-3812854, US-A-4036919, 
DE-A-3434111, DE-A-3734905, US-A-4533082, EP-A-0432992 & 
EP-A-0480615, and Physical Principles of Ultrasonic 
Technology by Rozenberg, published in Plenum. In some instances (e.g. DE-A-3734905 & US-A-3812854) 
the liquid-gas surface is several millimetres away from a 
source of mechanical oscillations placed within the liquid 
and the aerosol is created by the action of these 
oscillations propagated as sound waves that pass through 
the liquid to the liquid surface. In some such cases (e.g. 
US-A-3812854) the liquid-gas surface is constrained by a 
porous medium. In other cases (e.g. GB-A-2041249) the liquid is in 
the form of a thin film on a non-porous membrane which 
itself is driven by a similarly remote source of mechanical 
oscillations. These methods generally have low efficiency of energy 
utilisation in the production of the droplet spray or are 
of relatively high manufacturing cost. In yet other cases (e.g. US-A-4533082) the source of 
mechanical oscillations is closely adjacent to a porous 
membrane and the excitation passes directly from the source 
to the porous membrane. This method improves efficiency to 
some degree, but the apparatus remains a relatively complex  
 
assembly and has a relatively limited range of operating 
conditions. For example, it required a fluid chamber. In still other cases (e.g. EP-A-0432992) improvements 
in efficiency are sought by coupling the vibrating means to 
a perforate member by means of an annular member having a 
relatively thinner annular portion connected to the 
perforate membrane and a relatively thicker outer annular 
portion connected to the vibrating means. Thin member is 
claimed to act as an impedance transformer whereby 
relatively small amplitudes of acoustic vibration of the 
vibrating means are amplified prior to their transmission 
into the perforate member. This specification discloses 
the use of additional components (for example, a fluid 
chamber) and

   an actuator (7), for vibrating the membrane, the 

actuator comprising a composite thin-walled structure;
 
   and
 
   means (3) for supplying fluid directly to a surface of 

the membrane, as fluid is sprayed therefrom on vibration of 
the membrane, characterised in that the actuator (7) is
