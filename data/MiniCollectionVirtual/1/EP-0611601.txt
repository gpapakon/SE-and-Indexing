<ABSTRACT>
Method and device in the handling of recycling 
packages, such as bottles and cans. A recycling 

package (P) is introduced into the receiving space 
(A) of the device (10) and is transferred by means 

of a conveyor device (16) into an identification 
position and, after the identification, based on the 

identification, the recycling package is transferred to 
a plastic-bottle crusher device (D₂) or to a can 

crusher device (D₁). The press drum (D₁') of the 
can crusher device is rotated by means of a motor 

(M₁), and the press drums (D₂',D₂'') of the plastic-bottle 
crusher device (D₂) are also rotated by means 

of the corresponding motor drive (M₁).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and a device in the handling of recycling packages, 
such as bottles and cans. In the prior art, return automats are known, in which the recycling bottle or can is 
passed into connection with a scanning reader device, which reads the code label 
placed on the face of the product and, on its basis, identifies the product and 
transfers said product to further processing/rejection. The prior-art solutions of 
equipment have, however, not permitted a versatile acceptance of recycling packages. 
As a rule, the solutions of equipment have been designed for one recycling 
product only, such as recycling cans or recycling plastic bottles. In the present patent application, a novel method and a novel solution of equipment 
are suggested, wherein the above problem related to the type of recycling package 
has been solved. In the construction of equipment in accordance with the invention, 
both recycling cans and recycling bottles are received. The recycling cans are passed 
to a crusher device of their own, preferably a press, which presses the can into 
smaller volume. In a corresponding way, the plastic bottles are passed to a crusher 
device of their own, which presses the plastic bottles into smaller volume. The 
recycling packages that have been brought into smaller volume are transferred 
further into gathering storage. In the solution of equipment in accordance with the invention, the return automat 
that receives recycling packages, preferably plastic bottles and cans, comprises a 
frame construction and, in connection with its front panel, a receiving opening, into 
which the recycling package, such as a bottle or a can, is placed. The receiving 
space comprises an oblique inclined bottom, onto which the recycling package is  
 
placed and on which bottom, being guided by said inclined bottom, the recycling 
package is positioned against the end wall of the space by the force of gravity. In the solution of equipment in accordance with the invention, the bottom part is 
linked so as to pivot on hinge means and, if the weight of the recycling package 
exceeds a certain maximum weight, a limit switch is switched on. In such a case, the 
device does not transfer the recycling package further. In this way, the processing 
of full packages is eliminated. A photocell detects a recycling package in the lifting 
position. Moreover, a light curtain is placed at the mouth of the receiving space A. 
When the light curtain does not detect an object, such as the hand of the person who

Method in the handling of recycling packages, such as bottles and cans, wherein 
a recycling package (P) is introduced into the receiving space (A) of the device (10) 

and is transferred by means of a conveyor device (16) into an identification position 
(H) and, after the identification, based on the identification, the recycling package 

is transferred to a crusher device (D₂) for plastic bottles or a crusher device (D₁) for 
cans, characterized in that, in the method, the press drum (D₁') of the 

can crusher device is rotated by means of a motor (M₁), and that the press drums 
(D₂',D₂'') of the plastic-bottle crusher device (D₂) are also rotated by means of the 

corresponding motor drive (M₁). 
Device in the handling of recycling packages, such as bottles and cans, by means 
of which device the recycling package (P) is introduced into the receiving space (A) 

of the device (10) and is transferred by means of a conveyor device into an identification 
position and, after the identification, based on the identification, the recycling 

package is transferred to a crusher device (D₂) for plastic bottles or to a crusher 
device (D₁) for cans, characterized in that the equipment comprises a 

motor (M₁) and a motor output, from which both the crusher device (D₁) for cans 
and the crusher device (D₂) for plastic bottles are operated. 
Device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the output shaft of 
the motor (M₁) is fitted to rotate both the press drum (D₁') of the crusher device for 

cans and the press drums (D₂',D₂'') of the crusher device (D₂) for plastic bottles. 
Device as claimed in claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the can 
crusher device (D₁) comprises a press drum (D₁'), which is rotated by the intermediate 

of the gearbox (D) of the motor (M₁), the can being fed into the gap between the 
press drum (D₁') and a wedge-shaped back-up part (F₁) and being flattened into 

smaller volume, and that the crusher device (D₂) for plastic bottles comprises press 
drums (D₂',D₂''), which are operated by the intermediate of a transmission system 

consisting of cogwheels.
