<ABSTRACT>
A switching system (10) is modified to provide, in addition to 
conventional connections (110 + 111) between ports (100, 103), eavesdropping 

connections that couple only one-half of a conventional bidirectional connection 
between a pair of ports to a third port (102). If the pair of ports serves an adjunct 

processor such as a voice-mail system (11) and a user voice terminal (13), a voice- or 
speech-recognition unit (12) serving the adjunct processor may be connected to the 

third terminal to receive thereat only the transmissions (112) of the user voice 
terminal without the unwanted transmissions of the adjunct processor. If the 

transmissions of the user voice terminal are polluted with echoes of the adjunct 
processor transmissions, then each half of the conventional connection between the 

adjunct processor and the user voice terminal may be connected to a different one of 
two ports (102, 103) serving the voice- or speech-recognition unit, whereby the 

recognition unit is able to receive the polluted transmissions (112) of the user 
terminal separately from the transmissions (113) of the adjunct processor and use the 

latter to perform echo cancelling functions on the former so as to obtain only the 
transmissions of the user voice terminal without the unwanted transmissions of the 

adjunct processor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to telecommunications switching systems, and specifically to such systems equipped with adjunct processors.Adjunct processors are commonly used with telecommunications switching systems to provide features and other capabilities that are not available from the switching system itself. An illustrative example of an adjunct processor is a voice messaging system that interacts with callers to provide a voice message-delivery service between calling and called parties.A conventional way for a person to interact with an adjunct processor such as a voice messaging system is through his or her telephone keypad, which responds to the person's button presses by generating dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF, also known as Touch-Tone) control signals and sending them to the adjunct processor. An unfortunate limitation of this user interface is that it requires the person to have a DTMF telephone. Consequently, the many persons who have traditional rotary-pulse telephones are excluded from obtaining the services of the adjunct processor.A way to overcome this limitation is to equip the adjunct processor with a voice-or speech-recognition facility, which enables persons to interact with the adjunct processor through spoken commands. While such a facility may be built into newly-designed adjunct processors, it is often impractical, e.g., for cost reasons, to do so. And it is difficult to impossible to add such a facility to existing adjunct processors, in large measure because speech processing consumes large amounts of computing resources, which the adjunct processor normally cannot spare. Hence, it is preferable to provide the voice-or speech-recognition facility as a separate unit as an adjunct processor to the adjunct processor.A switching system comprising a voice terminal, an adjunct processor, and a voice-recognition arrangement is disclosed in US-A-4 878 290.Voice-or speech-recognition units are normally configured to terminate all input signals, not to terminate some (e.g., control commands) and to pass-through others (e.g., voice messages to be recorded). Consequently, without the use of additional circuitry, a voice-or speech-recognition unit normally cannot be connected --either in series or in parallel-- to the same switching system port as the adjunct processor which it is to serve. And while bridging, conferencing, or service observing arrangements which can connect a plurality of terminals (e.g., telephone station sets or adjunct processors) in parallel to a single call
