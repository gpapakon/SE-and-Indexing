<ABSTRACT>
In a process for treating cork bark produced from cork oaks (Quercus suber L.) for the production of bottle closures, a concentrated suspension of a pure strain of a rapidly growing, odour-neutral and taste-neutral mould is added to the peeled corkwood pieces. The aged, precooked corkwood pieces are advantageously added to an immersion bath of a concentrated suspension of a pure strain of a rapidly growing, odour-neutral and taste-neutral mould and gently agitated in the immersion bath.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the treatment of cork bark obtained 
from cork oaks (Quercus suber L.) for the production of 

bottle closures, characterized in that a concentrated 
suspension of a pure-bred strain of a rapidly multiplying 

mould which does not affect odour or flavour is added to 
the peeled cork panel sections. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the seasoned, pre-boiled cork panel sections are 

immersed in a liquor of a concentrated suspension of a 
pure-bred strain of a rapidly multiplying mould which 

does affect odour or flavour and gently moved in this 
liquor. 
Process according to Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the concentrated suspension has at least 100,000 

colony-forming units per ml. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the microorganisms, which are in 

dried form, are reactivated and rehydrated prior to use 
for 12 hours in a 0.1% sodium chloride solution to which 

0.1% peptone has been added. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that at least two pure-bred strains of 

rapidly multiplying mould species which do not affect 
odour or flavour are used in the form of a mixture. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the pure-bred strains used are 

species of the genus Penicillium.
