<ABSTRACT>
A transport seat for transporting and washing a disabled or invalid patient, characterised in that the seat is joined to the base through a connection (Figure 1, part 5) permitting a rotation B of approximately one quarter of a circle. The location of the connection is designed to raise or lower the seat over a distance A by means of the machine element (3) and the foot support (7) and knee support (11) over a distance C by means of the machine element (6) such as to position the patient in a suitable attitude for washing. A waist support (9), to which a safety belt (8) has been added to safeguard transport and rotation, is also provided in order to restrain the back of the patient and ensure a safe washing carriage.

<DESCRIPTION>
Daily cleanliness forms an important aspect of patient care. 
When patients become incapable of cleaning themselves due to 
physical disabilities, help must be provided by others. This 
requires heavy physical work from the personnel of an institution. 
When for instance a patient is a large disabled person, 
several staff members become involved in moving the patient: 
nevertheless there remains a risk of personnel straining their 
backs or otherwise injuring themselves in the course of this 
process. Lifting persons manually, an action which may often 
exceed the capability of the person performing it, endangers 
both the patient and the helper. The difficulty of performing 
by conventional means cleaning and lifting duties may also 
jeopardise the level of hygiene, as personnel must rapidly 
carry out dangerous and heavy work activities. Until now body cleaning has been performed using traditional 
methods and tools. Any available auxiliary machinery has usually 
turned out to be large, cumbersome, awkward and not well 
adapted to the task, which has meant that operating methods 
became conformant to the tools. Typical equipment includes 
shower baths, wash beds, wash benches, shower stretchers, 
shower wheelchairs and primitive washing stools. In spite of 
its unwieldiness this equipment must be used daily to maintain 
the hygiene of patients. Usually this equipment consists of 
separate devices, to which and from which the patient must be 
transported. The simpler and least expensive apparatus makes 
difficult even the most elementary toilet of the lower back,  
 
since the patient sits on these parts of the body which must 
be washed. The Finnish patent 54227 describes a solution well adapted to 
the transport and light lower back toilet of a patient. The 
lift, transport and wash device presented by this invention 
improves markedly the toilet facilities for a patient and 
permits a full body wash while in a position ergonomically 
advantageous to the personnel.  
 Another lifting and transporting apparatus is shown in US-A-5.001.789. It 
describes a transport seat for transporting and washing a disabled or invalid 
patient mounted on an base frame by a connection with a swivel axis permitting 
a rotation of approximately one quarter of a circle wherein the connection to the 
frame is constructed to allow raising or lowering the seat and further comprising 
a foot support, a waist support and a safety belt for holding and securing the 
patient. The connection is mounted to the base frame near one

<CLAIMS>
A transport seat for transporting and washing a disabled 
or invalid patient mounted on a base frame (1) by a 

connection of a primary lifting device (4) with a horizontal swivel 
axis (5), permitting a rotation of approximately one 

quarter of a circle, and with a raising device (3) 
arranged between the swivel axis (7) and the frame (1) 

near the center of the frame (1), and further comprising 
a knee support (11), a hip and safety belt (8), and a 

waist support (9),
characterized in that
 the waist support (9) is connected 
by a spring (12) to the primary lifting device (4), which 

further comprises a foot support (7) moveable with 
actuators (6) and an elbow support (10) so that, if the 

primary lifting device (4) is in the rotated position of 

about one quarter of a circle, the foot support (7) can 
be lowered.
