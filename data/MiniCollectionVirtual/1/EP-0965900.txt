<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for supporting on the body a hand controller
unit for the remote control of implements, tools, robots or similar, including a base section

intended to be attached to the body by means of a hip belt or similar, at least one supporting
arm arranged on the base section for supporting a hand controller unit and arranged to allow

adjustment of the position of the controller unit in relation to the base section. To simplify
adjustment of the hand controller unit, each supporting arm (6) includes a system of at least

one first arm (7) and one second arm (8) that are located at a distance from one another and
one above the other, and where the said arms are linked to the base section (3) by jointed

connections to allow pivoting around an essentially horizontal axis when seen from the point
of view of the operating position of the hand controller unit, whereby the hand controller unit

is moveable in relation to the base section and guided by the directional and guidance device
(11) that is active between a respective free end of the first and the second arm as well as the

controller unit and that can be fixed in position in relation to the base section by means of a
device (12) arranged on the directional and guidance device for locking the first and second

arms (7, 8) included in the supporting arm to the hand controller unit (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for supporting on the body a hand
controller unit for the remote control of implements, tools, robots or similar according to the
introduction to claim 1.A requirement of devices of this type is that they should be designed so that they
rest against the body in a comfortable manner and so that the user has a comfortable working
position with both hands free to manoeuvre the commonly found control handles, the so-called
joysticks, with which the hand controller units considered here are primarily equipped.
As the requirement for how the hand controller unit supported on the body should be located
to achieve a comfortable position from an operational point of view depends purely on
individual circumstances and is guided not the least by the build of the user, it is desirable that
the device is designed so that the hand controller unit is freely adjustable, i.e. adjustable at
least in height, in direction towards and away from the body of the user, and is also possible
to pivot or tilt towards or away from the body around its own axis to accommodate different
angled positions in relation to the horizontal plane.Known devices of the type specified above have, however, the disadvantage that
setting or adjusting cannot be carried out with a simple turn of the hand, but that the
adjustment of each range of movement of the hand controller unit must instead be made
individually.One objective of the present invention is thus to achieve an improved device of
the type specified above where the controller unit can easily be adjusted and locked in the
desired position.This objective of the invention is achieved with a device that has the features
specified in the characteristics section of claim 1.According to a specially advantageous embodiment of the invention, the arms of
the device are bow-shaped and preferably made from wire-like material or rod-like material
with a small cross-section. The hand controller unit is supported between the shank-shaped
parts of the bow-shaped arms and the bow-shaped arms are linked by pivoting connections
with a base section carried on the body of the user on a waist section that unites the shank-shaped
parts.Further features and advantages of the invention are evident from the other
claims and from the following description that refers to the attached drawings, where Fig. 1
shows a perspective view of a device according to the invention carried on the body of a user, Fig. 2 shows a section of a part included in the device according to the

<CLAIMS>
Device for supporting on the body a hand controller unit for the remote
control of implements, tools, robots or similar, including a base section intended to be

attached to the body by means of a hip belt or similar, at least one supporting arm arranged on
the base section for supporting a hand controller unit and ranged to allow adjustment of the

position of the controller unit in relation to the base section characterised in that each
supporting arm (6) includes a system of at least one first arm (7) and one second arm (8) that

are located at a distance from one another and one above the other, and where the said arms
are linked to the base section (3) by jointed connections to allow pivoting around an

essentially horizontal axis when seen from the point of view of the operating position of the
hand controller unit, whereby the hand controller unit is moveable in relation to the base

section and guided by the directional and guidance device (11) that is active between a
respective free end of the first and the second arm (7, 8) as well as the controller unit (2) and

that can be fixed in position in relation to the base section (3) by means of a device (12)
arranged on the directional and guidance device for locking the first and second arms (7, 8)

included in the supporting arm to the hand controller unit (2).
Device according to claim 1 characterised in that the arms (7, 8) are
bow-shaped and that hand controller unit (2) is supported between the shank-shaped parts of

the bow-shaped arms, whereby the bow-shaped arms (7, 8) are connected by pivoting joints to
the base section (3) at a waist section that unites the shank-shaped parts.
Device according to any of the previous claims characterised in that
the directional and guidance device (11) includes clamping devices that by interaction of the

screw device can be brought to abut with the hand controller unit (2), an axle pin (18, 18')
interacting with the free end of each arm (7, 8) and that extends through and is accommodated

in between the clamping device and that by means of a hole (21, 22) in the respective axle pin
accommodates the respective arm by allowing it to slide through.
Device according to claim 3 characterised in that the clamping device
includes two opposing plates in the form of a plate (13) firmly attached to the hand controller

unit (2) and a moveable plate (14) provided with holes (19, 19'; 20, 20') in which the axle
pins (18, 18') extend through and are accommodated, whereby the attached plate (13) is

provided with a threaded pin (15) that extends through a hole (16) in the moveable plate (14)
and with which threaded pin a knob (17) interacts.
Device according to any of the previous claims characterised in that
the arms (7, 8) are made of a wire-like material.
