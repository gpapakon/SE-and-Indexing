These applications are assigned to the assignee of this invention. The entire disclosure of each is incorporated herein by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to materials and methods fo 15 detecting and modulating the activity of RNA. The inventio generally relates to the field of "antisense" compounds whic are capable of specific hybridization with a nucleotid sequence of an RNA. In accordance with preferred embodiments, this invention is directed to the design, synthesis, an 20 application of oligonucleotides and to methods for achievin therapeutic treatment of disease, regulating gene expression i experimental systems, assaying for RNA and for RNA product through the employment of antisense interactions with such RNA, diagnosing diseases, modulating the production of 25 proteins, and cleaving RNA in a site specific fashion. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIt is well known that most of the bodily states in mammais, including most disease states, are effected by proteins. Such proteins, either acting directly or through their enzymatic or other functions, contribute in major proportion to many diseases in animals and man. Classical therapeutics has generally focused upon interactions with such proteins in efforts to moderate their disease-causing or disease-potentiating functions. Recently, however, attempts have been made to modulate the actual production of such proteins by interactions with the intracellular RNA molecules that code for their synthesis. By interfering with the production of proteins, it has been hoped to effect therapeutic results with maximum effect and minimal side effects. It is the general object of such therapeutic approaches to interfere with or otherwise modulate gene expression which would lead to undesired protein formation.One method for inhibiting specific gene expression is the use of oligonucleotides as "antisense" agents. The oligonucleotides complementary to a specific target messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence are used. A number of workers have reported such
