control voltage to the VCO of the phase locked loop dependent 
on a tuning voltage which is alterable in response to the 

frequency of the signal output by the VCO.

The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for
frequency tuning of a phase locked loop.In setting up the tuned frequency for operation of a phase

signal translation circuit having a first input connected to
receive a first voltage and a second input connected to receive
a tuning voltage, the signal translation circuit providing a
control voltage to the voltage controlled oscillator which is
dependent on the first voltage and the tuning voltage, a
frequency detection circuit for detecting a frequency of the
signal output by the voltage controlled oscillator in response
to the control voltage, whereby the tuning voltage is altered in
response to the frequency detected by the frequency detection
circuitry.According to one aspect of the present invention there is
provided a phase locked loop apparatus comprising a phase
comparator connected to receive an input signal to the phase
locked loop, and a voltage controlled oscillator having a first
output coupled to a further input of said phase comparator, the
phase comparator providing as an output a first voltage dependent
on the phase difference between the first output of the voltage
controlled oscillator and the input signal to the phase locked
loop characterised by:-
