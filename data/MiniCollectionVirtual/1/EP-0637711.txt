<ABSTRACT>
The flow control valve has the valve element (36) pressed onto the valve seat (22) by a closing spring (38). The spring acts on a main piston (30) between two hydraulic chambers (44,42) with a control piston (50) pressed into a bore through the centre of the main piston to move hydraulic fluid under the main piston and lift the valve into the open position. Non-return valves (58) hold the valve open. The two fluid ducts between the two hydraulic chambers can be fitted with non return valves to hold the main valve open or closed as required. With a flow restriction bridging the non-return valves a time delay is obtained in which the valve is held open, or closed, for a set time.

Valve device (10) for fluid media having a valve 
receptacle (12) which comprises an inlet side (26) which 

is in flow connection with a fluid system exposed to a 
system pressure, an outlet side (28) and a valve seat 

(22), and having a closure piston (30) which can be moved 
from a closed position to an open position by means of a 

hydraulic system (14) separated from the fluid system 
against the force action of a closing spring (38) and 

which creates in the open position a flow connection from 
the inlet side (26) to the outlet side (28), wherein the 

hydraulic system (14) comprises a first and a second 
liquid space (42, 44) and also an actuating piston (50) 

for moving the closure piston (30) into the open position 
while displacing hydraulic liquid from the first liquid 

space (42) into the second liquid space (44) via a first 
flow connection (56) comprising a non-return valve (58) 

and wherein a second flow connection (62, 60) is present 
which is parallel to the first flow connection (56, 58) 

and into which a barrier member (66; 80; 90) can be 
inserted when the closure piston is moved into the open 

position, which barrier member prevents, in the open 
position of the closure piston (30), an unimpeded backflow 

of the hydraulic liquid from the second to the first 
liquid space (44; 42) and, in the closed position of the 

closure piston (30), permits an unimpeded liquid exchange 
between the first and the second liquid space (42; 44). 
Valve device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the closure piston (30) and the actuating piston  

 
(50) are coaxially disposed and perform opposing movements 

when the valve device (10) is actuated. 
Valve device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the barrier member (66; 80; 90) is an 

actuating pin which can be actuated by the actuating 
piston and in that the second flow connection (62, 60) 

comprises a bore (60) which matches the actuating pin 
(66; 80; 90). 
Valve device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the actuating pin (66; 80; 90) is supported on the 

actuating piston (50). 
Valve device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the bore (60) is disposed coaxially with respect to 

the actuating piston (50) and to the barrier member (66; 
80; 90). 
Valve device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the bore (60) is disposed in a plunger (32). 
Valve device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the barrier member (66) essentially 

completely interrupts the second flow connection (62, 
60). 
Valve device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the barrier member comprises a 

throttle bore (82; 92).  
 
Valve device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the barrier member (66; 80; 90) can 

be removed from the second flow connection (62, 60) 
independently of the movement of the actuating piston 

(50). 
Valve device according to one of Claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that the closure piston (30) comprises 

a bore (48) which is matched to the diameter of the 
actuating piston (50) and is coaxial with the latter and 

into which the actuating piston (50) is inserted when the 
valve device (10) is actuated. 
Valve device according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that, when the closure piston (30) is inserted into the 

coaxial bore (48), the actuating piston (50) is adjacent 
to the closure piston (30) so as to form a seal and 

thereby subdivides the first liquid space (42) into two 
subspaces (46; 47), wherein the second subspace (47) is 

connected to the second liquid space (44) via the first 
and, optionally, the second flow connection (56; 62, 60). 
Valve device according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the hydraulic system (14) is 

essentially at atmospheric pressure in the closed state 
of the closure piston (30). 
Valve device according to Claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that the hydraulic system (14) is a closed 

system and comprises a volume equalization part (54) 
which equalizes the volume elements penetrating the  

 
hydraulic system from the actuating piston (50) and the 

actuating pin (66; 80; 90). 
Valve device according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the volume equalization element (54) is a closed-pore 

polymer foam.
