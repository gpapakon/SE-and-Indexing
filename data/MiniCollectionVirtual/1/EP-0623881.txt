<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for 
determining heart rate which comprises weighting intervals 

between beat triggers on the basis of the size of a sample 
window, grouping the weighted intervals and determining the 

dominant group of beat triggers. The invention also 
provides a monitor arranged to carry out the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for determining the heart
rate of a patient. More particularly, this invention relates to
methods for rapidly determining the heart rate of a patient over
a short period or window of time for immediate display to the
attending physician or nurse.Presently there exist many methods or techniques for
determining the heart rate of a patient. The simplest method
comprises the manual averaging of heart beats over a period or
"window" of time by multiplying by the number of beats by a
multiplier to determine an average heart beat interval that is
then used to compute the number of heart beats per minute.
Longer periods or windows may be employed for more accurate heart
rate determination. The longer periods necessarily result in
increased response times for reporting and acting upon changing
rates.For the past decades, electronic or computerized heart rate
monitors have been developed for automatically determining the
average heart rate of the patient and for displaying the heart
rate to the attending physician or nurse. Most of these monitors
employ techniques for identifying or characterizing non-arrhythmic
artifacts and activities that would otherwise skew the 
averaging of the heart rate. Common non-arrhythmic activities
include PVCs, non-blanked pacer spikes, fast flushes, and short
noisy or unstable regions.By way of example, as shown in U.S. patent 4,478,224,
improved heart rate determinations may be obtained by monitoring
the patient's EKG signal to detect heartbeat artifacts and for
producing a corresponding inhibit signal. The inhibit signal is
supplied to the heart rate monitor to inhibit the heart rate
determinations whenever the artifacts are detected. During
operation, the heart rate monitor measures the time intervals
between successive heartbeats and estimates heartbeat rate based
on a plurality of such time interval measurements. If the
inhibit signal ever occurs, indicating the occurrence of a
heartbeat artifact, the inhibit signal inhibits the monitor from
continuing to measure the current heartbeat interval.
Thereafter, when the inhibit signal terminates, indicating that
the artifact is no longer present, the monitor resumes measuring
time intervals after the occurrence of the next heartbeat.US-A-4 790 326 shows a method wherein each trigger interval is
used to compute a pulse rate, the ensemble of the calculated
pulse rates is recorded as a distribution curve which is
subsequently searched for a region of maximum density. The pulse
rates within said region

<CLAIMS>
A method for determining a dominant heart rate from a series
of beat triggers representative of a mixed series of normal heart

beats and non-arrhythmic activities, with the beat triggers being
determined at a specific sampling rate defining sample intervals,

comprising the steps of:

framing a window to include a portion of the series of beat
triggers and to be beat-aligned with a first beat trigger and a

last beat trigger, the window thereby defining a plurality of

trigger intervals for respective adjacent beat triggers, with
each trigger interval containing a plurality of the sample

intervals existing between the respective adjacent beat triggers;
summing the windowed sample intervals;
for each of the trigger intervals, computing a weight factor
based upon the ratio of the summed windowed sample intervals to

the number of sample intervals within that trigger interval;
grouping the weight factors;
computing the percentage of the window that each group of
weight factors constitutes to determine the dominant group

constituting the highest percentage and
containing the dominant beat triggers; and
analyzing the dominant beat triggers within the dominant
group to determine the dominant heart rate.
The method as set forth in Claim 1, wherein the step of 
framing a window to include a portion of the series of beat

triggers and to be beat-aligned with a first beat trigger and a
last beat trigger, comprises the step of sizing the window

including the steps of aligning a leftmost frame of the window with
the first beat trigger and aligning a rightmost frame of the

window with the last beat trigger.
The method as set forth in Claim 2, wherein the step of
sizing the window comprises the step of predetermining a minimum-sized

window, aligning the leftmost frame of the minimum-sized
window with the first beat trigger and then increasing the

rightmost frame of the minimum-sized window such that the
rightmost frame of the window is aligned with the next beat

trigger after the minimum-sized window.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the steps of
grouping the weight factors and computing the percentage of the

window that each group of weight factors constitutes to determine
the dominant group, comprise the step of:


numbering bins to correspond to the increasing groups of the
weight factors; and
computing the percentage of the window that each numbered
bin represents to determine the dominant numbered bin containing

the dominant beat triggers.
The method as set forth in Claim 4, wherein the step of
numbering bins to correspond to the increasing groups of the

weight factors, comprises the steps of determining the maximum
number of sample intervals that occur for a maximum-anticipated

heart rate at the specific sampling rate, computing the ratio of
the number of windowed sample intervals to such maximum number of

sample intervals, numbering the maximum numbered bin to the
closest whole number to the ratio, and then evenly distributing

the groups of weight factors from numbered bin one to the maximum
numbered bin.
The method as set forth in Claim 5, wherein the sampling
rate is approximately 400 hertz and wherein the minimum-sized

window comprises approximately five seconds.
The method as set forth in Claim 6, wherein the step of
numbering bins to respective increasing bin numbers, comprises

the step of numbering bins to ranges.
The method as set forth in Claim 4, wherein the step of
computing the percentage of the window that each numbered bin

represents to determine the dominant numbered bin containing the
dominant beat triggers, comprises, for each numbered bin, the 

step of determining the number of trigger intervals contained
within that numbered bin and then dividing that number of trigger

intervals by that numbered bin's bin number to compute the
percentage of the window that that numbered bin represents.
The method as set forth in Claim 8, wherein the step of
computing the percentage of the window that each numbered bin

represents to determine which numbered bin contains the dominant
beat triggers, further comprises the step of selecting the

numbered bins constituting the highest percentages of the window
as the dominant numbered bins containing the dominant beat

triggers.
The method as set forth in Claim 9, wherein the step of
analyzing the beat triggers within the dominant numbered bins to

determine the dominant heart rate comprises the step of averaging
the dominant beat triggers within the dominant numbered bins to

compute the dominant heart rate.
The method as set forth in Claim 8, wherein the step of
analyzing the beat triggers within the dominant numbered bins to

determine the dominant heart rate comprises the step of selecting
the most dominant bin constituting the highest percentage. 
The method as set forth in Claim 1, wherein the step of
analyzing the beat triggers within the dominant group to

determine the dominant heart rate comprises the step of averaging
the dominant beat triggers within the most dominant group to

compute the most dominant heart rate.
