<DESCRIPTION>
 BIS(DIALLYLAMINO) SILANESRelated ApplicationThis is a continuation-in-part of my co-pending application Serial No. 894,970, filed June 8, 1992.Technical FieldThis invention relates to the use of bis(diallylamino) silanes of the general formulaR1I (CH2=CH-CH2)2N-Si-N(CH2-CH=CH2)2I R2where R 1 and R2 are independently selected from alkyl and aryl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms as comonomers for lower olefins polymerized in highly active Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems.Background ArtIn European Patent Publication 0423438, Sivak et al propose the use of protected diallyl amine monomers for copolymerization with ethylene, propylene, and other lower alpha-olefins having up to 8 carbon atoms. Protection of the otherwise vulnerable amine group is provided by a silyl group 

having relatively bulky substituents, such as lower alkyl or phenyl groups. Diallyl amines are proposed and several examples are given of silyl-protected diallyl amines. However, bis-diallyl amines are not contemplated.Summary of InventionI have invented new compounds of the general formulaR1I (CH2=CH-CH2)2N-Si-N(CH2-CH=CH2)2I R2where R 1 and R2 are independently selected from alkyl and aryl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.They may be used as cross-linking agents in polymers and find special utility as comonomers for lower olefins polymerized in highly active Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems.Detailed Description of the InventionMy invention will be described with respect to two paradigms, namely bis(diallylamino)dimethylsilane and bis(diallylamino)diphenylsilane. 

 EXAMPLE IBis(diallylamino)dimethylsilaneThe equipment used for the synthesis of bis(diallylamino)dimethylsilane was set up in the following manner. A reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer and 125 ml addition funnel were placed on a 2000 ml 3-necked, round-bottomed flask. An argon inlet was connected to the top of the reflux condenser and a heating mantle was placed on the flask. The flask was flushed with argon (allowing the argon to exit the setup through the top of the addition funnel) until the atmosphere in the glassware was assured of being inert.Heptane (400 ml), triethylamine (136.62 g, 1.350 moles, 188 ml) and diallylamine (98.36 g, 1.012 moles, 125 ml) were charged into the reaction flask. Dichlorodimethylsilane (43.55 g, 0.3375 moles, 41 ml) was placed in the addition funnel and added to the reaction mixture in the flask over a period of 70 minutes. The temperature of the reaction mixture reached 37.5Â°C (as measured by a thermocouple between the flask and heating
