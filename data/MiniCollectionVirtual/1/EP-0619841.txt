<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides substantially purified T-cadherin polypeptides and isolated nucleic acids which encode the T-cadherin polypeptides. Antibodies reactive with various forms of T-cadherin, but not reactive with N-, E- or P-cadherin are also provided. The invention provides methods for detecting the various forms of T-cadherin in a subject as well as a method of inhibiting tumor cell migration which consists of increasing tumor cell adhesion with an effective amount of T-cadherin. A method of repairing traumatized neurons is provided. The method entails treating traumatized neurons with a therapeutically effective dose of T-cadherin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cell surface molecules and
more specifically to T-cadherin, a new cell adhesion
molecule of the cadherin family.Cadherins are a family of transmembrane glycoproteins
that mediate adhesive interactions in the developing and
adult organism through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism
(Takeichi, 1988 and 1990, review). It has been suggested
that the cadherins arose from a common ancestral gene.
Duplication of the gene may have resulted in the formation
of a structurally related family of molecules with
heterogeneous sequences. Cadherins share their overall
structure which, at the extracellular region, is subdivided
into a signal peptide, a prepeptide and five related
extracellular domains and is followed by a transmembrane
domain and a highly conserved stretch of cytoplasmic amino
acids, that is suggested to provide a linkage with the
cell's cytoskeletal network. The signal peptide and the
prepeptide are readily cleaved and are absent from the
mature protein. Several members of the cadherin family
have been characterized. N-cadherin is found in the
nervous system during development and has been shown to be
a strong mediator of nerve fiber growth invitro. In
addition to neural tissue, N-cadherin is also expressed in
heart and skeletal muscle and in lens cells. E-cadherin
(also known as uvomorulin in the mouse) is a component of
epithelial cells and P-cadherin is found in placenta.T-cadherin, which is subject of this application, is
a novel member to the cadherin family that shares the
overall cadherin structure in the extracellular region, but
lacks the conserved cytoplasmic sequences. Therefore, a
new mode of T-cadherin function is proposed, in which T-cadherin 
regulates the adhesive cell properties not through
a direct linkage with the cytoskeleton, but through higher
membrane mobility and ready access to its extracellular
ligand. The pattern of T-cadherin expression suggests a
key role in the establishment of the pattern of nerve fiber
growth in developing embryos. Furthermore, T-cadherin is
the first molecularly characterized polypeptide to be
identified in a segmental pattern as epithelial somites
undergo the transition to form the dermamyotome and
sclerotome. The expression in only one half of the somitic
sclerotome, that eventually will give rise to vertebrae,
suggests that T-cadherin plays a key role in the
segmentation of vertebrate embryos. Segmentation is a
crucial property of the vertebral column that allows
flexibility and provides an individual with the ability to
bend the
