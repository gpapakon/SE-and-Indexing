<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved electric connector assembly 
for use in coupling two printed boards. The height of such 

assembly is reduced yet a good effective length of contact 
beam and increased distance between the soldering tails of 

the opposite terminals is assured. Each female terminal 
(9a, 9b) is composed of a horizontal base (10), a contact 

beam (13) rising from one end of the horizontal base and 
having a contact (12) near its top end. A transition (15) 

descends from the other end of the horizontal base, and a 
soldering tail (16) horizontally extends from the 

transition. The female terminals are attached to opposite 
side walls (3, 4) of their housing with their horizontal 

bases partly embedded in the opposite side walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical
connector according to the preamble of claim 1.An electrical connector according to the
preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-5,167,528 or EP-A
0 567 007 A3. Each terminal of such an electrical connector
comprises a vertical beam and a horizontal leg. The vertical
beam extends through the base of the housing, whereas the
horizontal leg includes the tail portion to be soldered to
an electrical circuit of a circuit board.
During the soldering process of such a
connector, the solder will, by adhesion force, travel
upwards along the tail portion and further along the
vertical beam. Once the solder has reached the point where
the vertical beam protrudes the housing, it begins to spread
along the bottom of the housing and may cause short circuits
with neighbouring terminals. Also, solder that collects on
the base of the housing is not available for the soldering
joint between the terminal and the circuit board, rendering
the connection incomplete and unreliable.Japanese Patent Application Public Disclosure No. 5-144498
discloses such an electric connector assembly of
reduced height. As seen from Fig. 19 herein, its female part
has a pair of female terminals 2' arranged in opposite
relationship and fitted in its housing. Each female terminal
is composed of a vertical base section 3', a soldering tail
61 horizontally extending from one end of the vertical base 
section 3' and a contact 5' rising up from the other end of
the vertical base section 3'. The opposite female terminals
2' are embedded by their base sections 3' in the floor 4' of
the housing 1' of the female part, allowing their soldering
tails 61 to lie under the bottom 7' of the housing 1', and
at the same time, allowing their contacts 5' to remain in
the terminal accommodating space in the housing 1'. As seen
from the drawing, there are no recesses made in the bottom
7' of the housing 1' particularly in the vicinities of the
transient parts from 
the soldering tails 6' to the vertical base section 3' of
the opposite female terminals 2'.The male part of the conventional electric connector
has a pair of male terminals 10' arranged in opposite
relationship and fitted in the housing 9'. Each male
terminal 10' is composed of a vertical contact section, a
soldering tail 13' horizontally extending from one end of
the vertical contact section, a slanted transient section
extending from the other end of the vertical contact
section, and a vertical holding section 11' extending from
the slanted transient
