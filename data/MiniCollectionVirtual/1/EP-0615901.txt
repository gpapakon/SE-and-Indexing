<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an aircraft landing gear with lateral retraction. In accordance with the invention, the leg (50) of the gear is formed from an articulated rigid strut assembly (10), and of a bogey beam (12) capable of turning about a shaft (13) which, in gear lowered position, is substantially perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the aircraft, and a damper (15) links the strut assembly (10) to the bogey beam (12). The bogey beam (12) is furthermore directly linked to a pivoting control means (100) which is arranged to reduce the angle (A) which the direction of the strut assembly and the direction of the bogey beam form when the gear is retracted, and conversely to increase this angle when the gear is lowered, while conforming to a predetermined trajectory.
