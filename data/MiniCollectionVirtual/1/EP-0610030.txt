<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a cellular radiotelephone system and a
radiotelephone for it. Transmission (TX) and reception (RX) is in the system

effected in different time slots, and the same centre frequency and bandwidth are
used for transmission and reception. The radiotelephone measures (PM) the level

of the signal (IRX) it receives from the base station and, in accordance with said
received signal level, controls the power of the signal (ITX) to be transmitted in

the transmit time slot immediately following said reception time slot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transmit power control apparatus and method for a
radiotelephone operable in a radiotelephone system utilising substantially the same centre
frequency and bandwidth for both signal transmission and reception.In a cellular radio system based on time division multiple access (TDMA) or frequency
division multiple access (FDMA), the control of transmit power is not necessary regarding
the system operation. The first systems thus used the same transmit power all the time. In
present cellular radiotelephone systems (e.g. NMT) control of the cellular radiotelephone
power is used basically in order to save battery capacity. Power control is further used in
small cells in order to reduce the noise level towards adjacent cells. However, usually there
are only a few (about 5 to 10) usable power levels.In a system based on code division multiple access (CDMA), in which the spectrum is
spread with the DS technology (Direct Sequence), the power received by the base station
from different cellular radiotelephones should be approximately equal, so that the system
can accommodate as many users as possible. In the CDMA system the primary object of
the power control is thus to maximize the capacity of the system. Then the power level
must be controlled very accurately, and the transmit level must be minimized.The transmit power can be controlled according to two different principles, either as open
loop control or as closed loop control. In the open loop control the telephone measures the
signal power received from the base station and then controls its transmit power
accordingly. Generally the method does not, however, provide a good measurement
accuracy, and thus it is neither possible to fully minimize the transmit power, so that it
would not be inadvertently controlled too low due to the measurement inaccuracy. The
reason for this is that the transmitted and received signals are differently attenuated,
because they are situated at different frequencies. The difference can be 10 to 40 dB,
depending on the radio signal's bandwidth and the propagation conditions. Thus the
transmit power must be dimensioned to be sufficiently high, so that a reliable transmit link
can be created. Open loop control is generally used in the present FDD/FDMA and 
FDD/TDMA systems (FDD, frequency division duplex), in which the transmit and
reception is effected at different frequencies. The open loop control method is simple, but
its disadvantage is the measurement inaccuracy of the method.US-4,811,421
