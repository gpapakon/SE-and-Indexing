<ABSTRACT>
For a lock (1) which can be blocked both mechanically by a key (23) and by an electromechanical locking device (39), it is proposed to transfer the galvanic contacts (39, 41), via which an electronic control circuit (37) of the key (23) is connected releasably to a control circuit (43) controlling the locking device (29) and located in the lock, into a cover part (45) separate from the case (3) of the lock (1). The contacts (39) arranged on the shank (27) of the key (23) are assigned, in the cover part (45), radially resilient contacts (39) which are offset in the direction of rotation relative to the rotation-blocking position of the lock (1). Seated rotatably in the cover part (45) is an insulating part (59) which, in the rotation-blocking position, completely covers the contacts (41) of the cover part (45). The insulating part (59) has an aperture, through which the contacts (41) of the cover part (45) contact the contacts (39) located on the key, as soon as the lock (1) is rotated out of the rotation-blocking position after mechanical release by means of the key (23).
