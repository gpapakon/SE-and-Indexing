<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic device is able to perform measurements on 
blood flow using physiological salt solution, which is 

harmless to living objects, as a tracer. The device is 
arranged to irradiate the head portion (4) of a subject 

alternately with laser light 1 and laser light 2, from 
lasers (3). The light exiting from the head portion (4) is 

detected and converted to an electric signal by a 
photomultiplier tube (6). By performing a first 

calculation on this electric signal, a CPU (1) outputs a 
signal representing the change in concentration of 

hemoglobin in the head (4). Further, a second calculation 
process is performed on the electric signal which 

represents changes in concentration of hemoglobin generated 
by injection of the physiological salt solution. At least 

one of the blood flow, the absolute concentration of 
oxyhemoglobin or deoxyhemoglobin is displayed. Because a 

material safe to living objects is used as the tracer, 
measurement of the blood flow can be safely and repeatedly 

performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a measuring device
that measures at least blood flow, oxygen saturation level
in the blood, or the absolute concentration of hemoglobin
of blood in a living object injected with a liquid (for
example, a physiological salt solution) that is safe for
living objects.Supply of blood to various organs of living objects is
an essential factor for maintaining the life of living
objects and for living objects to function properly. Blood
supply to the brain is particularly important. Measuring
cerebral blood flow is an indispensable tool for patients
where there is a danger of the brain falling into a
critical condition. In one conventional technique, a
radioactive substance, such as radioactive xenon, is
injected into a living object as a tracer. Changes in the
tracer are measured by a Î³-ray sensor attached to the head
of a subject under investigation. Blood flow is then
calculated. In another technique, the tracer injected is
a pigment, such as cardio-green. By monitoring the flow of
the pigment according to changes in the amount of light
irradiated from an external source that is absorbed by the
pigment, the blood flow is then calculated.U.S. Patent No. 4281645 describes a device for
measuring changes in blood oxygen and blood concentration
in the brain (not cerebral blood flow itself). This device
uses near-infrared (NIR) light as a light source. Living
tissue is comparatively transparent to NIR light. The
device also uses an extremely sensitive sensor, such as a
photomultiplier tube, in the optical detector. Although
previously only measurements of thin body portions such as
finger tips and ear lobes was possible, this device allows
measurements of the head. This reference describes
clinical monitoring of the head which allows measurements
of changes in concentration of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) and
deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) in the blood in the head. There have been known the following problems with the
above-described device. Measurements can not be repeatedly
performed, because tracers such as pigments and radioactive
materials are undesirable to living objects. Also,
countries and organizations often prohibit injecting these
tracers into human subjects. Although more stable and more
precise than another conventional technique using the
Doppler effect which measures blood flow from the
wavelength shift of an ultrasonic wave, measurement of
blood flow using such tracers is difficult in a clinical
situation. Although a device (hereinafter referred to as
an NIR monitor) which measures
