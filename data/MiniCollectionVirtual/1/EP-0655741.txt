<ABSTRACT>
In DRAM, a part of data in a row are rewritten at high 
speed. The memory device comprises dynamic type cell 

blocks (11); sense amplifiers (3) for sensing data of the cell 
blocks (11); latches (2) for storing data; data transfer gates 

for transferring data between the sense amplifiers (3) and 
the latches(2); and byte write mask circuit blocks (1) for 

controlling only the data transfer gates corresponding to 
only the latches (2) in which data have been written, to 

transfer data to the sense amplifiers (3). The byte write 
mask circuit block (1) opens only the transfer gates corresponding 

to the latches (2) to which data are written and 
further transfer data from the latches (2) to the sense 

amplifiers (3). Therefore, when data are required to be 
written in the cell blocks 11, since only the necessary 

data are written in the latches (2), it is possible to 
eliminate wasteful data write to the latches (2), thus 

enabling a high speed data transfer to the cell blocks (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory device and
a serial-parallel data transforming circuit, and more
specifically to the memory device and the serial-parallel
data transforming circuit which can write data in cells at
high speed in a DRAM, in particular.As is well known, when cell data are accessed in the
DRAM, since small charge information stored in the cells
must be sensed and further amplified, it takes a long time
for accessing the cell data. In this case, the sensing
operation must be executed for all the cells belonging to
selected word lines, that is, selected rows in a cell
array.By the utilization of the sensing operation, a page
mode is well known in which the cells belonging to the same
row are accessed at high speed. In this page mode, bit
lines and sense amplifiers connected to a number of cells
are rewritten compulsorily. Therefore, there inevitably
exists a speed limit in the write cycle in this page mode.To overcome this problem, there has been known a method
of executing the page mode without directly transfer data
to and from the bit lines (as disclosed in Japanese
Published Unexamined (Kokai) Patent Application No. 60-7690,
or U.S. Patent No. 4,608,666). In this method, a row
of SRAM cells is arranged along the rows of the DRAM cell
array, and data are transferred between the DRAM and an
external circuit through the SRAM cells. In this method,
since the sense operation and the bit line capacitance of
the DRAM cells can be separated from the external data
transfer due to the presence of the SRAM cells, it is 
possible to obtain a high speed access determined by the
access cycle to the SRAM.In the above-mentioned method of accessing the DRAM via
the SRAM, however, data transfer is executed between the
SRAM and the DRAM in unit of row, some restriction conditions
arises in the SRAM cells. In more detail, since the
contents of the SRAM cells in which data are not written
are undefined, when data are written in a part of the SRAM
cells and further the written data are transferred to the
DRAM cells, undefined data are written in the DRAM cells
corresponding to the SRAM cells to which data are not
written, with the result that the data so far stored in the
DRAM cells are destroyed. To solve this problem, it is
necessary to write data in all the SRAM cells or to
transfer the contents of the DRAM cells (to which data are
to be transferred) to the SRAM cells previously, before a
part of the DRAM cell contents are rewritten.The problem involved in the prior art memory device
will be
