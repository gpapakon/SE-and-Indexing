<ABSTRACT>
A portable dispenser (10) for spherical 
confectioneries such as gumballs (12) has a clear tubular 

reservoir (145) that is movable with respect to a base 
(15). Within a substantially hollow interior of the base, 

(15) a pivoting ramp (95) is mounted to receive a single 
gumball (12) and convey it to an opening (30) in the base 

(15) while blocking other gumballs (12) from dropping out 
of the tubular reservoir (145). Mounted for pivotal 

movement adjacent a free end of the ramp (95) is a door 
(115) for freeing the opening (30) in the base (15) as the 

ramp (95) itself pivots to convey the gumball (12) toward 
the opening (30). Adjacent the bottom of the tubular 

reservoir (145) are a pair of actuators (134) that lock 
the tubular reservoir to the base (15) for limited 

movement relative to the base. The actuators (134) engage 
the ramp (95) upon the tubular reservoir (145) being moved 

toward the base (15). An integrally formed spring (110) 
on the bottom of the ramp (95) biases the ramp and biases 

the tubular reservoir (145) away from the base (15). 
Adjacent the top of the tubular reservoir (145) is a 

pivotally mounted head (175) for capping the tubular 
reservoir. The head (150, 164) may conveniently be styled 

as a licensed character and indications (140) are provided 
to facilitate proper rotational alignment with the other 

components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to 
confectionery dispensing devices and more particularly to 
portable dispensers for generally spherical 
confectioneries such as gumballs and jawbreaker candies. Confectioneries, particularly candy and gum, 
have long been popular with children and adults alike. 
Dispensers of individual pieces or small quantities of 
confectioneries are particularly popular with children. 
Numerous of such devices exist in which a coin must be 
inserted for the device to dispense a piece of candy or 
gum. Indeed, a popular form of savings banks for children 
are gumball dispensers which require the child to 
deposit a coin before being able to obtain a gumball. 
Many devices for dispensing confectioneries, while 
portable in the sense that they may be moved from one 
location to another, are not readably carried upon the 
person of the user. There have, however, been portable, 
handheld devices for the dispensing of individual flat, 
generally rectangular solid, pieces of candy. Examples of 
such candy dispensers in which the upper portion of a 
handheld dispenser is manipulated to eject a piece of 
candy from adjacent the top of a magazine containing a 
number of upwardly spring biased pieces are shown in Uxa  
 
United States Patent No. 2,620,061 issued December 2, 
1952; Uxa United States Patent No. 2,853,206 issued 
September 23, 1958; Haas United States Patent No. 
3,410,455 issued November 12, 1968; Hinterreiter United 
States Patent No. 3,565,284 issued February 23, 1971; Haas 
United States Patent No. 3,942,683 issued March 9, 1976; 
Haas United States Patent No. 4,295,579 issued October 20, 
1981 and Haas United States Patent No. 4,966,305 issued 
October 30, 1990. Such devices require manipulation of the 
top of the dispenser by the user's hand holding the 
dispenser or a finger or the thumb of the other hand. 
Haas United States Patent No. 3,263,860 issued August 2, 
1966 discloses another type of dispenser for such flat 
pieces of candy carried in a rearwardly angled hopper for 
ejection through an opening adjacent the bottom of the 
hopper. Ejection is accomplished by a mechanism carried in 
a base atop which the hopper is mounted. The ejection 
mechanism is a spring biased linkage that operates upon 
depression by the user of a bar that is exposed through 
the top of the base adjacent the hopper opening to move a 
pair of ejector arms through openings in the back of the 
hopper to push a single piece of the flat candy out the 
opening. In addition to requiring a base
