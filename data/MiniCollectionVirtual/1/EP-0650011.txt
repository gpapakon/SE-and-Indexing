<ABSTRACT>
A centralized lighting system is provided having 
a high intensity light source (12) which is disposed at 

approximately the first optical focal point of an 
ellipsoidally shaped reflector member (14). A mirror 

member (16), disposed in advance of a second optical focal 
point associated with the reflector member, receives 

light output from the light source and is constructed 
so as to divide the light output into at least first 

and second beam portions. The mirror member is further 
effective so as to separate the first and second beam 

portions by at least 90 degrees relative to one 
another. Corresponding at least first and second 

optical transmission members are receptive of the first 
and second beam portions and are effective for 

communicating the light output to locations remote from 
the light source. In one embodiment, the mirror member 

is V-shaped and is constructed of first and second 
mirror segments (30a,30b) joined together so as to form an angle 

of less than about 85 degrees therebetween. The mirror 
member is effective for dividing the beam portions so 

that such beam portions are substantially equivalent to 

one another in terms of intensity, shape and color. 
The V-shaped mirror member is further effective for 

separating the first and second beam portions by 
approximately 180 degrees relative to one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high efficiency light
source having a dual output. More particularly, this
invention relates to such a light source as utilizes a
single high brightness lamp whose light output is split
using a reflector configuration that results in an
efficient coupling of such light output into the input
face of a pair of optical fibers.High brightness light sources have been proposed
for a variety of centralized lighting applications
whereby it is desired to have a single source of light
which can be distributed to at least two locations
remote from the light source. For instance, such a
single light source, dual output arrangement could be
put to beneficial use in the automotive industry for
purposes of front end illumination. To this end, such
a configuration has been proposed in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,958,263 and 5,222,793 issued to Davenport et al on
September 18, 1990 and June 29, 1993, respectively, and
assigned to the same assignee as the present invention.
Central source/remote light output configurations such
as this could also be put to use in other applications
such as in a merchandise display situation or for
medical or scientific instrumentation. In some such
applications, particularly automotive forward lighting
arrangements, it would be desirable to have the light
source exit from the dual ports which face in opposite
directions from one another. As shown in Figure 7 of
the U.S. Patent No. 5,222,793 referenced above, one 
approach would be to join two ellipsoidally shaped
reflectors in a back-to-back configuration with the
light source disposed approximately at the center of
the point at which the reflector segments are joined.
Although effective in achieving a dual light output
which exits the source at oppositely facing directions
to one another, this approach would require precision
manufacturing and assembly operations to implement and
accordingly, would result in a high priced end product.
Therefore, it would be advantageous if a single source,
dual output lighting arrangement could be achieved at
a reasonable cost in terms of manufacturing of the
component elements and the assembly thereof into a
system configuration.Another approach to providing a dual output from
a single light source would be by use of a reflector
and mirror arrangement such as shown in Figure 3 of
previously referenced U.S. Patent No. 5,222,793. In
this arrangement, two optical fibers are disposed in
close contacting relation to one another so that the
light output from an ellipsoidally shaped
