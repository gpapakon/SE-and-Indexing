<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of voicemail and more particularly to a
voicemail system that provides browsing and searching capabilities.Voicemail has become a very popular method of communication in the corporate
workplace. Typically, voicemail systems are connected to a central office of a local
telephone company or to a private branch exchange handling calls for a large number of
telephones. When one of the telephones serviced by the central office or other system is
not answered, the calling party is given an opportunity to leave a telephone message
which is stored for later reproduction by the user of the called telephone. The voice
mailbox owner is given the ability to reproduce, store or dispose of the message.When a user has received a number of voicemail messages in their mailbox, the
user typically has no choice but to listen to each message in a sequential fashion to
determine who sent the message and whether any important or relevant information is
contained in the message. Current methods for accessing voicemail or more generally,
recorded speech, require that the speech has to be stored and listened to in a sequential
and serial manner. This can be a very cumbersome and time consuming process
especially when a user has several messages which may range from a few seconds to
several minutes long. Additionally, when voice messages contain information such as
phone numbers and addresses, the user may be forced to replay the message more than
once in order to accurately obtain the needed information from the message.Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a voicemail system which allows a
user to gist, search and browse through the messages in an efficient and intuitive manner. The present invention is an automated voicemail processing system for gisting,
browsing and searching through voicemail without having to sequentially listen to each
of the voicemail messages. The system includes a voice mail processor which has a
transcription component for transcribing one or more voicemail messages into text, a text
retrieval component for indexing the one or more transcribed voicemail messages, an
information extraction component for identifying selected information within the one or
more indexed voicemail messages and a user interface for providing the identified
selected information.Additionally, the system may automatically extract information, such as phone
numbers, addresses, dates, etc. from the transcribed voicemail messages. The voicemail
messages are then displayed on a
