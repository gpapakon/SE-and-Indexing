<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a folding principle which can be universally applied for maps and town plans, which leads to a smaller format (4), compared to the initial format, by using diagonal folding lines (3) in the four corners of a rectangular sheet, which smaller format is once again reduced in size by further folding. Variants result from additionally providing the initial format with additional areas which have been folded over, so that, on the one hand, the principle of the folding can be maintained, the sheet, on the other hand, when unfolded completely, is largely increased by the areas of the edges which have been folded over. The folding principle permits a decidedly improved handling of town plans and street maps, the required space being extremely small in the state in which is folded up completely. It is possible, easily and without the risk of mis-folding, to unfold and fold up again a sheet which has been folded using this principle. In addition, the folding makes it possible to extend the area which can be sensibly used for continuous printing to the reverse side of the sheet and to save paper and costs in this way.

<CLAIMS>
Rectangular foldable sheet for large area images (particularly drawings and maps),

which can be reduced to a smaller format by folding it to the inside along folding lines that are placed
equally spaced from all four edges. As a result, and relative to the initial format, a proportionally smaller

format will be produced that is characterized by
four additional folding lines on the edges (3), apart from the four folding lines which run parallel to the
exterior edges (1,2), that result as follows:
each of the additional folding lines on each of the edges runs vertically to the diagonal of the square (A1, A5,
G1, G5),
whose surface is limited (1,2) by the folding lines that run parallel to the edges,
and where the additional folding line runs through the point of intersection of the two folding lines that limit
the square (point of intersecton of 1 and 2).
Rectangular foldable sheet according to claim 1, characterized by

additional areas at the exterior edges of the sheet,
that enable folding without overhang (Figure 6: areas A'1 to G'1 and areas A'5 to G'5).
Rectangular foldable sheet according to claims 1 or 2, characterized by

areas of the sheet according to claims 1 or 2 having been cut.
Rectangular foldable sheet according to claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized by

a cut that reduces the sheet to half of its length or half of its width.
