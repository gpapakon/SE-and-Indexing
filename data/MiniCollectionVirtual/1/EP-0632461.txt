<ABSTRACT>
A memory device comprises a plurality of arrays (26) of 
memory cells within the array area (12) of said device, said 

arrays (26) formed in a plurality of parallel rows and 
columns. A plurality of decoders (36) is provided, each 

array (26) spaced from a next adjacent array (26) in a row 
direction by at least one of said decoders (36). In the 

array area (12) a plurality of predecoders (40) is formed, 
each array (26) spaced from a next adjacent array in a 

column direction by at least one of said of predecoders 
(40). For each predecoder (40) a plurality of predecoder 

lines coupled to outputs (RDD0, RDD1, RDD2, RDD3, 44) is 
provided. There are at least two decoders between each pair 

of arrays in a row direction, each decoder being operable to 
address only half of each of the array of each pair, and the 

predecoder lines coupled to the two closest decoders in a 
column direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to
a memory device as defined in the precharacterizing part
of claim 1.
In DE-A-3 447 722 a memory device of this type is disclosed
which makes use of a distributed decoder. Industrial users of dynamic random access
memories (DRAMs) are demanding ever-quicker timing and
ever-smaller power specifications. To meet these
specifications, designers must design DRAMs to read from
and write to the DRAM storage cells more and more quickly
while at the same time using less power. This requires
that improved methods be discovered to drive DRAM word
lines to Vdd during the precharge portion of the reading
cycle and to boot them above Vdd during the active restore
portion of the cycle. These functions are a substantial
part of an active cycle's length.A selected row line is driven for reading, and
is booted for the active restore function, using a
drive/boot signal transmitted from a drive/boot signal
generator conventionally located in a peripheral area of
the chip. An increasing importance has been placed on the
decoding path of this drive/boot signal from the
drive/boot generator to the active word lines. If this
decoding path is too resistive or capacitive, the driving
and booting of the word lines will be too slow. In
addition, if the drive/boot signal path is too capacitive,
the device will use too much power.To illustrate the disadvantages of present
drive/boot signal decoding systems, two examples will be
described. In a pair of conventional 64K and 256K DRAM
designs, one drive/boot generator is provided. Its output
is split into two separate global signal lines (that is,
signal lines that extend over the entire array) using pass
gates. Therefore, only one of the split lines is required
to be active in any given cycle. Each of the split lines 
then connects to one-half of all of the word line drivers
or decoders in the DRAM in order to drive and boot the
appropriate word lines. The row decoders are selected by
addressing signals. Thus, in any given cycle, the one
master drive/boot signal will "see" the parasitic
capacitance of one-half of all of the word line drivers on
the entire chip connected to it, plus the parasitic
capacitance of two extra decoding pass gates. In addition
to the relatively large amount of capacitance that this
creates, the drive/boot signal is required to travel
through the resistance of one pass gate and one word line
driver to get to each decoded word line.According to another conventional design used in
256K and 1M CMOS DRAMs, four
