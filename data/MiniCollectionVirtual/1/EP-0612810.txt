<ABSTRACT>
A room temperature-curable organopolysiloxane composition 
is disclosed, comprising (A) 100 parts by weight of an 

organopolysiloxane terminated with a silanol group or an alkoxy 
group, (B) from 0.1 to 30 parts by weight of an organosilicon 

compound containing more than 2, in average, of hydrolyzable 
groups bonded to the silicon atom per molecule, (C) from 0.5 to 

50 parts by weight of a hydroxyl-containing organic compound 
capable of swelling a polyolefin resin and, if desired, (D) a 

requisite amount of a curing catalyst. The composition 
exhibits satisfactory adhesion to an untreated polyolefin resin 

to provide sufficient adhesive strength for withstanding 
practical use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a room temperature-curable 
organopolysiloxane composition and more particularly a room 
temperature-curable adhesive composition exhibiting 
satisfactory adhesion to a polyolefin resin which is hard to 
adhere, e.g., polypropylene or polyethylene, and therefore 
useful as a sealing compound for polyolefin resins. Polyolefin resins, such as polypropylene and 
polyethylene, which are non-polar resins, are excellent in not 
only rigidity despite their lightness but heat resistance and 
molding properties. Accordingly, they are molded by various 
molding methods to provide moldings broadly useful as 
automobile parts, electrical equipment, constructional 
materials, house furnishings, and daily necessaries. However, being non-polar, polyolefin resins are very 
difficult to adhere to other materials for fixing and withstand 
no practical use when fixed with conventional adhesives. In order to improve adhesion of the polyolefin resin to 
those resins, the polyolefin resin has been subjected to a 
surface treatment, such as a flame treatment, a corona 
discharge treatment or a treatment with a chromic acid mixture, 
or a primer treatment with an organotitanium compound, an 
organoaluminum compound or a chlorinated polyolefin.  However, the surface treatment requires a treatment 
apparatus therefor, encounters difficulty in giving uniform 
treatment when applied to a complicatedly shaped or large-sized 
article, and involves troublesome operation. The primer 
treatment sometimes requires an apparatus therefor depending on 
the primer coating method employed. Whichever means one may 
take, the treatment is involvement of an additional step, 
making the adhesion operation more complicated. On the other hand, a room temperature-curable 
organopolysiloxane composition is widely used as an adhesive or 
a sealing compound in various fields on account of its 
excellent adhesion and mechanical characteristics of a cured 
product thereof, but yet it hardly adheres to polypropylene or 
polyethylene. To overcome the above-described technical problem, a 
method for adhesion between a polypropylene resin and a room 
temperature-curable silicone rubber composition is disclosed in 
JP-A-60-135437 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"). This 
technique is directed to a primer treatment to provide an 
undercoat layer between adherends, still involving the problem 
of making the adhesion treatment (operation) complicated. An object of the present
