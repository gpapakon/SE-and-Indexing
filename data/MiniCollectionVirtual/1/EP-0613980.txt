<ABSTRACT>
A ballast levelling machine (1) with a machine frame (4) supported on rail running gear (5) is equipped with a ballast plough (11) which is height-adjustable by means of drives (8), a height-adjustable and rotatable sweeping brush (18), a suction arrangement (17) having a vacuum generator (16), as well as with a driver's cab (19). The machine frame (4) consists of a first frame part (2) having the ballast plough (11) at the front in the travelling direction, and of a further, second frame part (3) which is articulatedly connected to the first frame part and has the vacuum generator (16) and the sweeping brush (18). The suction arrangement (17) has a suction nozzle (20) which projects beyond the machine end (21) at the rear with respect to the travelling direction, is connected to the vacuum generator (16) by a flexible suction pipe (22) and to a drive (40) and which is adjustable by means of a control device (23) located in the adjoining driver's cab (19).

A ballast grading machine comprising a machine frame 
(4;48) supported on on-track undercarriages (5), a ballast 

plough (11) designed for vertical adjustment by means of 
drives (8), a vertically adjustable and rotatable sweeping 

brush (18), a suction arrangement (17) having a vacuum 
generator (16), and a driver's cab (19), characterized in 

that the machine frame (4;48) is composed of a front, first 
frame part (2;49) in the direction of travel which has the 

ballast plough (11), and at least one other, second frame 
part (3;50) joined to the said first frame part in an 

articulated manner and having the vacuum generator (16) and 
the sweeping brush (18), and in that the suction arrangement 

(17) has a suction nozzle (20) projecting over the rear 
machine end (21), with respect to the direction of travel, 

and connected by means of a flexible suction pipe (22) to the 
vacuum generator (16) and connected to drives (40,41,44), the 

said suction nozzle being adjustable by means of a control 
unit (23) located in the adjacent driver's cab (19). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that on 
the second frame part (3) is provided a conveyor belt (24) 

which extends in the longitudinal direction of the machine 
and of which the lower, intake end is assoicated with the 

sweeping brush (18) and the elevated, discharge end is 
associated with a ballast hopper (14) situated on the first 

frame part (2). 
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the suction nozzle (20) is adjustable by means of the 

drives (40,41,44) into an inoperative position above or 
laterally adjacent to the rear machine end (21) and 

immediately following the driver's cab (19) (Fig. 3).  
 
A machine according to one of claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the suction nozzle (20) is attached to 

a vertically adjustable parallelogram linkage (38) which 
is connected to a support body (39) for pivoting about a 

vertical axis (42), the support body (39) being transversely 
adjustable by means of a drive (44) perpendicularly to the 

longitudinal direction of the machine and horizontally. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the suction nozzle (20) is connected by 

the suction pipe (22) to a cyclone separator (26), of which 
the outlet opening (27) located in the lower end region is 

followed by a lock chamber (28) with a remotely controllable 
discharge opening (29). 
A machine according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the discharge opening (29) of the lock chamber (28) is 

arranged above the conveyor belt (24) or is associated 
therewith. 
A machine according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the suction nozzle (20) is connected by the suction pipe (22) 

to a fine dust filter unit (30). 
A machine according to claim 7, characterized in that 
associated with the fine dust filter unit (30) is a store 

(31), of which the lower end region has a screw conveyor (32). 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the ballast plough (11) is arranged with 

respect to the direction of travel immediately following a 
driver's cab (13) situated at the front end of the machine 

frame (4;48) within visual range thereof or between the said 
driver's cab and the ballast hopper (14).  

 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that in a holder (33;60) designed for 

vertical adjustment by means of a drive (35;61) another 
sweeping brush (34;59) is mounted on the machine frame (4;48) 

and is detachably secured thereto. 
A machine according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that provided between the front, first and 

rear, second frame part (49,50) of the machine frame (48) is 
another, central or third frame part (51) which is joined in 

an articulated manner to both frame parts and on which there 
is arranged a ballast store (54) with a base conveyor belt 

(55) forming the base area thereof and extending to above the 
ballast hopper (14). 
A machine according to claim 11, characterized in that 
the third frame part (51) is designed as a self-propelling 

hopper wagon provided with bogie undercarriages (5) and a 
motive drive (53), to which the first and second frame parts
