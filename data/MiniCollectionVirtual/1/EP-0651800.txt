<ABSTRACT>
Several natural polypeptides (basophil granule proteins, "BGP") derived from the cytoplasmic granules of human basophils, and modified forms thereof, are described. These polypeptides, the DNA which encodes them and antibodies which recognize them, are useful as diagnostics for, and treatments for, pathologies involving inflammatory and IgE-mediated responses, parasitic and helminthic infections, hypersensitivity reactions and certain types of leukocytic leukemias.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to therapeutics and
human immunology. More specifically, it relates to
proteins found in the cytoplasmic granules of human
basophils, to the genes which encode them, to the
antibodies which recognize them, and to the use of these
proteins, oligonucleotides, and antibodies in the diagnosis
and treatment of disease.The basophil, along with the mast cell, contains
cytoplasmic granules with an affinity for basic dyes. The
basophil is produced by the bone marrow and circulates in
the blood. Basophils are associated with helminthic
parasitic infections and allergic reactions and they
possess a high affinity receptor for IgE antibodies.
Little is known however about the proteins which comprise
the granule, in part because, under normal conditions,
basophils constitute less than 1% of peripheral blood cells
and it is therefore difficult to obtain an adequate amount
of purified material for study. While some researchers
have proposed that basophils are the precursors of mast
cells, recent data suggests that basophils represent
terminally differentiated leukocytes, possibly more closely
related to eosinophils (Galli, S.J. and Lichtenstein, L.M.,
in Allergy:Principles and Practice, Middleton et al (Eds.),
3rd Ed, Vol. 1 (1988), pp 106-134).Basophils appear to participate in many
inflammatory, immunological and pathological reactions. 
For a general review see Galli et al, Prog Allergy (1984)
34:1. The most striking tissue infiltrates of basophils
occur in cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity reactions
(Galli and Askenase, in The Reticuloendothelial System:A
Comprehensive Treatise, Abramoff et al (Eds.) pg 321,
Plenum Press 1986). Recent studies suggest that basophils
are essential for expression of immunity to the feeding of
larval Amblyomma americanum ticks. Here, basophils may
collaborate with eosinophils in the expression of immunity
by acting to attract eosinophils into tissues where the
eosinophils subsequently release toxic cationic proteins
(Brown, S.J. et al, J Immunol (1982) 129:790). Basophils
are also elevated during helminthic infections, suggesting
that they might participate in host defense to these
parasites (Ogilvie, B.M. et al, Immunol (1980) 39:385;
Lindor, L.J., Parasite Immunol (1983) 4:13; Juhlin, L. and
Michaelsson, G., Lancet (1977) 1:1233). Evidence also
exists that basophils function in hypersensitivity reaction
(Schwartz, L.B. and Austen, K.F. in Immunological Diseases,
Samter et al (Eds) Little Brown & Co 4th Ed, pg 157 (1988);
