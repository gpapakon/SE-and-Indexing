<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) and method are described which wind 
stiffened coreless rolls comprising a spiral wound roll 

(12) formed from a product paper (14), conventionally paper 
having a printed pattern or design on one side, and a 

spiral stiffener sheet (16) extending completely around the 
roll to stiffen the roll. The apparatus receives webs 

(40,42) of product paper and stiffening paper, severs the 
stiffening paper (42) into short lengths (20) for winding 

into the roll of product paper and automatically feeds the 
stiffening sheet onto a length of the product paper (14) 

which is wound into a roll (12). The two webs (40,42) are 
fed to either side of a rotating cutter roll (66) and anvil 

assemblies (72,88) are moved into engagement with a knife 
carried on the cutter roll selectively to sever the webs as 

required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus and methods for 
cutting webs of paper and for winding stiffened coreless rolls 
from the cut lengths of paper. Conventional roll winding machines wind coreless rolls 
of product paper by feeding a web of paper along a path, 
winding the lead end of the web into a roll at a web rolling 
assembly, severing the web and discharging the completed 
roll from the machine. A machine of this type is shown in 
U.S. patent No. 4,807,825. This machine rapidly manufactures 
coreless rolls from product paper, typically wrapping 
paper of the type used to wrap birthday and holiday gifts 
and other packages. Coreless rolls may be wound from relatively short 
lengths of product paper or from relatively long lengths of 
product paper. Rolls wound from longer lengths of product 
paper are relatively stiff, because of their wall thickness, 
and resist dents or flattening better than rolls wound from 
shorter lengths of product paper. Shorter length rolls are 
relatively flimsy and are easily dented or flattened. This 
is a serious problem because the rolls are manufactured at  
 
a site and must be transported without damage to a retail 
site where the rolls are displayed for customer purchase. 
The rolls are easily dented or flattened during shipment, 
rendering the rolls unsuitable for consumers. It is conventional to stiffen rolls of product paper by 
winding the length of paper around a preformed cardboard 
core. The core effectively strengthens the roll but has a 
number of disadvantages. Because cores are large, light, 
and expensive to transport, cores are conventionally 
manufactured from paper and glue at the site where the rolls 
are wound. Core manufacture is expensive and requires 
considerable space on the shop floor for the material used 
in making the cores, the core making equipment and the 
inventory of cores required for the winding of cored rolls. 
In fact, the total cost of a glued paper core for a roll of 
wrapping paper may amount to as much as 75 percent of the 
total manufactured cost of the core and roll. The invention consists in an apparatus and a method for winding 
a stiffened coreless roll as described in claims 1 and 9 hereof. 
An apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 is described in 
DE-B-1104320. In one embodiment of the invention, the winding apparatus 
receives a first continuous web of product paper which 
is wound into a coreless roll and a continuous web of relatively 
stiff paper which is automatically cut into segments. 
The segments are

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10) for winding a stiffened coreless roll 
(12), comprising first means (44,54,50,58) for feeding a 

first web (40) of paper along a first path (34) to roll 
winding means (30), second means (38, 60, 62, 63, 64) for 

feeding a second web (42) of paper along a second path (36) 
extending to a junction with the first path (34), and 

cutting means (66, 72, 88) for severing the webs (40, 42) 
as they travel along the first and second paths, whereby a 

severed length of the second web (42) is wound into the 
spirals of the roll (12) formed by the roll winding means, 

characterised in that 

A) the cutting means comprises 
a rotary cutter (66) having a knife blade (68) 

secured to and rotatable with the cutter, 
B) said first path (34) is located on a first side 
of the cutter (66) and said second path is located on a 

second side of the cutter, 
C) a first anvil blade (78) is located on said first 
side of the cutter (66) outside of the first path (34) and 

is cooperable with said knife blade (68) to sever the first 
web (40) of paper on the first path, and 
D) a second anvil blade (94) is located on said 
second side of the cutter (66) outside of the second path 

(36) and is cooperable with said knife blade (68) to sever 
the second web of paper on the second path. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cutter 
(66) is rotatable to move the knife blade upstream along 

one path (34 or 36) and downstream along the other path (34 
or 36). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the knife 
blade (68) and said first anvil blade (78) are curved and
