<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substituted indole, azaindole and 
tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridin-7-one compounds and derivatives thereof, 
useful as angiotensin II antagonists, particularly effective in the control of 
smooth and cardiac muscle contraction, especially for the treatment of 
cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. 
Additionally, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the 
treatment of chronic renal failure and disorders of the alimentary tract, and 
have procognitive, anxiolytic and antidepressant activities. The renin-angiotensin system is a fundamental physiological mechanism 
for regulating blood pressure in mammals. Angiotensinogen is secreted into 
the bloodstream by the liver. Angiotensinogen is then cleaved by the protease 
renin to yield the decapeptide angiotensin I, which in turn is hydrolyzed by 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to the octapeptide angiotensin II. 
Angiotensin I is inactive in the cardiovascular system, but angiotensin II has 
numerous cardiovascular-renal activities. For example, it stimulates the 
adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone, which causes the kidneys to retain 
sodium and water, increasing blood pressure. It causes vasoconstriction. It 
also facilitates neurotransmission in the sympathetic nervous system. The effects of angiotensin II, such as arteriolar vasoconstriction, 
contraction of gastro-intestinal smooth muscle, aldosterone secretion, 
glycogenolysis, alteration of renal function and CNS effects, are mediated by 
the activation of specific angiotensin II receptors on smooth and cardiac 
muscle, adrenal medulla, brain, liver and kidney. Angiotensin II receptors 
are categorized into subtypes, for example the AT-1 and AT-2 subtypes. It is 
evident that disease states associated with activation of angiotensin II 
receptors could be usefully treated by compounds possessing angiotensin II 
antagonist activity. Various angiotensin II receptor antagonists are known. See, for 
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,333,943, 4,880,804, 5,053,329, 5,124,335, and 
European Patents 0 245 637, 0 253 310, and 0 291 969, and also Wong et al.,

et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 165:196-203 (1989).  
 A first aspect of the present invention relates to compounds of the 
Formula (I): 
 
wherein : 
R1 is (C1-C10)alkyl, (C3-C8)cycloalkyl or (C3-C8)cycloalkyl (C1-C10)alkyl; R2 is 2"-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4'-ylmethyl; X is
