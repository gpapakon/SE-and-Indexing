<ABSTRACT>
A catheter placement unit comprises an introducing needle (2) having a pointed tip (6) for introducing a catheter (4) into a desired position in a patient's body, a needle hub (3) for mounting the needle (2) so that the needle extends through an axial bore in the catheter (4) during introduction of the catheter into the patient's body and so that the needle can subsequently be withdrawn from the catheter bore leaving the catheter in position in the patient's body, and a needle tip protector (10) on the needle for shielding the needle tip (6) when the needle has been withdrawn from the catheter bore. The needle tip protector (10) includes a guard element (16) which is held against a resilient bias in a cocked position to one side of the catheter (4) while the catheter is introduced into the patient's body and which, on subsequent withdrawal of the needle (2) from the catheter bore, is moved laterally by resilient action from the cocked position into a guard position in which it shields the needle tip (6). Thus the protector (10) reliably guards against needle stick injuries during withdrawal and subsequent disposal of the needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "Catheter Placement Units" This invention relates to catheter placement units.It is established medical practice to introduce a flexible tubular catheter into a desired position in a patient's body by means of a catheter placement unit which includes an introducing needle extending externally or internally of the catheter and projecting beyond the end of the catheter. In use of such a catheter placement unit to place a catheter within a patient's vein for supply of infusion fluid, for example, the needle tip projecting beyond the end of the catheter serves to puncture the patient's skin and to locate the catheter within the vein. When the catheter is suitably positioned, as may be determined by the flow of blood in the hub of the needle, the needle may be withdrawn leaving the catheter .in position in the vein. Typically the needle is completely withdrawn from the catheter and safely disposed of prior to the connection of a fluid line to the catheter so as to prevent damage to the patient by the needle during infusion. However the need to withdraw the needle from the catheter leads to a risk that doctors or nurses will accidentally prick themselves with the needle, and this can be highly dangerous due to the risk of transfer of blood-related diseases.US 3463152 and US 3536073 disclose catheter placement units of a type in which the needle is withdrawn into a housing connected to the catheter and locked 

 therein after placement of the catheter in the patient's body, in order to prevent damage to the patient from the needle. However such catheter placement units are complex and bulky in that they require a needle housing which remains attached to the catheter in use, and are not suitable for use in applications where the needle is to be withdrawn completely from the catheter and disposed of.â– US 4978344 discloses a catheter placement unit of a type in which the needle is withdrawn completely from the catheter and disposed of after placement of the catheter in the patient's body, and in which the action of withdrawal of the needle from the catheter causes a tethered cap portion to be drawn over the needle tip. However the drawing of the cap portion over the needle tip relies on frictional engagement of the cap portion by the catheter hub, and it is possible to withdraw the needle from the catheter without triggering the required capping action. Also, because of the form of the capping portion, it is possible for the needle tip to be re- exposed after capping.It is an object of the invention to provide a

CLAIMS 1. A catheter placement unit comprising an introducing needle (2) having a pointed tip (6) for introducing a catheter (4) into a desired position in a patient's body, a needle hub (3) for mounting the needle (2) at its end remote from the needle tip (6) so that the needle extends through an axial bore in the catheter (4) for introduction of the catheter into the patient's body and so that the needle can subsequently be withdrawn from the catheter bore leaving the catheter in position in the patient's body, and a needle tip protector (10) on the needle for shielding the needle tip (6) when the needle has been withdrawn from the catheter bore, characterised in that the needle tip protector (10) includes a guard element (16) which is held against a resilient bias in a cocked position to one side of the catheter (4) while the catheter is introduced into the patient's body and which, on subsequent withdrawal of the needle (2) from the catheter bore, is moved laterally by resilient action from the cocked position into a guard position shielding the needle tip (6) .
2. A unit according to Claim 1, characterised in that the unit includes the catheter (4) and a catheter hub (5) for mounting the catheter so that the needle (2) extends through the catheter hub (5) into the catheter bore, and the guard element (16) is held in the cocked position by engagement with the catheter hub (5) while the catheter is introduced into the patient's body. 


 3. A unit according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the protector (10) is coupled to the needle hub (3) by a flexible elongate member (11) permitting movement of the needle hub (3) away from the protector (10) to withdraw the needle (2) from the catheter bore.
4. A unit according to Claim 3, characterised in that the flexible elongate member (11) is connected to the needle hub (3) by means of a sliding connection (12) permitting paying out of the flexible elongate member (11) between the needle hub (3) and the protector (10) until a stop (18) on the flexible elongate member (11) is reached.
5. A unit according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the protector (10) includes a body part (13) having a bore (12A) extending therethrough for passage of the needle (2), the guard element (14) being mounted on the body part (13) so as to be movable between its cocked and guard positions.
6. A unit according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the guard element (14) is a 
'
 resilient element which is held under tension in its cocked position and is moved into its guard position under its own resilience.
7. A unit according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the guard element (14) is fixed at one end and has a bent portion (14) at its other end for shielding the needle tip (6) .
8. A unit according to any preceding claim, characterised in that the guard element (14) is mounted on 


 the protector (10) by a tensioning part (15) which is movable from an initial position permitting positioning of the protector (10) relative to the catheter to a tensioning position holding the guard element (14) under tension in its cocked position.
9. A unit according to Claim 8, characterised in that the tensioning part (15) is hingedly connected to the protector (10) so as to be pivotable from its initial position to its tensioning position. 10. A catheter placement unit comprising an introducing needle (2) having a pointed tip (6) for introducing a catheter (4) into a desired position in a patient's body, a needle hub (3) on which the needle (2) is mounted, and a removable protective cap (31) for shielding the needle tip (6) , characterised in that the protective cap (31) is coupled to the needle hub (3) by a coupling part (32, 42) which is disengageable from the needle hub (3) by pivoting to effect removal of the protective cap (31).
