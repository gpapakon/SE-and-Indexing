<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to United States patent application 
07/450,635 of Jenkins and Wisnieff filed on December 
13, 1989, now United States Patent No. 5,179,345 the entire 
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. This invention relates to electrical testers. More particularly 
it relates to a method and apparatus for electrical 
testing of a thin film transistor liquid crystal array 
(TFT/LCD). The array tester described in United States Patent No. 
5,179,345 provides a means for comprehensively testing 
every cell in a TFT/LCD array using only the array's edge 
connections. The basic test performed by the array tester 
is to write charge onto a cell (by properly biasing the 
gate and data lines), store charge on the cell by biasing 
the gate off, read the remaining charge off of the cell by 
connecting a charge integrating circuit to the data line 
and biasing the gate line on, and then measure the charge 
that has been transferred to the charge integrating circuit 
to determine the final value of charge. Electrically testing the large arrays inherent to TFT/LC 
displays at any stage prior to the attachment of line 
drivers requires contacting a large number of pads (typically 
in the thousands). Contamination (such as residual 
photoresist, oxide films, etc.) and substrate non-planarity  
 
can interfere with good electrical connection 
between the tester probes and the array pads. To insure 
validity of the many tests that write charge to, and read 
charge from, selected pixels, it is necessary to determine 
whether the tester probes are actually making contact to 
the array pads. There are various mechanical ways to assure electrical 
contact to the pads. However, these require at least one 
of mechanical motion between the pads and the probes, the 
use of additional probes to determine the integrity of the 
electrical contact, or mechanical abrasion of the pads or 
gate lines. These procedures are expensive, time consuming 
and may themselves introduce possible sources of failure 
for the array under test. Thus, it is highly desirable 
that various electrical integrity checks can be made using 
only the probes normally required to contact the pads, and 
that these probes be used in the normal manner described in 
the above mentioned patent. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
method for determining contact quality to the pads in a 
TFT/LCD array. It is another object of the invention to provide a method 
for determining the line integrity of gate lines
