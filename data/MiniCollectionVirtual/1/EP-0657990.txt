<ABSTRACT>
Devices for driving stepper motors (10 ... 10n, 10m ... 10mn; 100 ... 100n), which contain a controller (16) which contains first and second switching means (17 ... 17m, 18 ... 18m) or first and second changeover means (170, 180). The first switching means (17 ... 17m) make it possible to select at least one electrical power supply line (11 ... 11n, 11m ... 11mn) which is connected to at least one stepper motor (10 ... 10n, 10m ... 10mn). The first changeover means (170) apply either a positive or a negative potential to the electrical power supply lines (110, 111 ... 110n, 111n) of the stepper motors (100 ... 100n). The second switching means (18 ... 18m) or the second changeover means (180) emit to a predetermined number of control lines (12 - 15, 12m - 15m) the control signals which are required for the stepper motors (10 ... 10n, 10m ... 10mn; 100 ... 100n). The advantage of the devices according to the invention is that the cabling cost is less than that for individual cabling. The device according to the invention is suitable for use in a motor vehicle. A preferred application is for a heating or air-conditioning system of a motor vehicle.
