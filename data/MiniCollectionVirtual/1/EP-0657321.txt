<ABSTRACT>
Supply system for a multicurrent locomotive having 2N motors, with N greater than or equal to 2, comprising 2N pairs of voltage converters (Bi1 and Bi2), respectively associated with the 2N motors, each motor Mi being supplied by means of a DC-AC converter connected to the terminals of a charging capacitor (Ci). When the supply of the locomotive is in AC, each of the pairs forms a 4-quadrant converter, the two parts of which are connected by the secondary winding (Si) of a transformer, the primary winding of which is connected directly to the terminals of the AC supply. When the locomotive is supplied in DC, commutators (Hi1 and Hi2) make it possible to use the voltage converters either as voltage step-down choppers or as voltage step-up choppers. This supply system is designed in such a way that, in the event of malfunction of a converter or DC-AC converter, it is sufficient to isolate it while keeping the others functional. Availability is considerably improved because, even in the event of malfunction, force is retained on at least three motors.
