<ABSTRACT>
A snow vehicle comprises at least one runner (20, 20'; 
54) by way of a ski which is mounted in such a way that it 

can be tilted and/or steered by means of manual tilting 
and/or steering members (5) connected actively to actuators 

(17, 18, 22, 17', 18', 22'; 153) for tilting and/or steering 
the runner (20, 20'; 54). In order to ensure greater ease, 

accuracy and reliability of steering, the invention provides 
that the manual tilting and/or steering member (5) is 

connected to the runner (20, 20', 54) tilting and/or 
steering actuator (17, 18, 22, 17', 18', 22'; 153) by means 

of a transmission system (30, 26, 27, 126, 127, 26', 27', 
126', 127'; 60, 61, 60', 65, 66, 67, 67') constructed in 

such a way as to be mechanically rigid, i.e. with little or 
no play relative to the position of tilting and/or steering. 

The vehicle may be of the so-called snowmobile kind, or else 
a vehicle with no means of propulsion and adapted only to 

descent, similar to a skibob. The invention also includes 
further improvements to the structure of the frame of a snow 

vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a snow vehicle comprising a 
load-bearing frame and two ski-like parallel runners which 
are connected with the load-bearing frame by means of 
runner-carrying arms in such a way that they can be steered 
and/or tilted by means of a control shaft which can be 
rotated manually through hand grip means and is connected by 
means of a transmission system with a steering and/or 
tilting shaft fixed to each runner and rotatably supported 
by the associated runner-carrying arm, the said transmission 
system comprising for each runner a pair of opposing 
transmission cables which engage on opposite sides of the 
longitudinal axis of the vehicle a control pulley rotating 
integrally with the control shaft, said cables being connected on 
opposite sides of the longitudinal axis of the associated 
runner with an actuating pulley that rotates integrally with 
the steering and/or tilting shaft of the runner. A snow vehicle of this kind is known from the document 
FR-A-2672504, according to which the ski-like runners are 
connected with the vehicle frame by means of elastically 
flexible runner-carrying arms. The document FR-A-2166780 describes a single runner 
snow vehicle, in which the runner is pivoted to the lower  
 
end of a vertical rotatable steering tube by means of 
longitudinal and a transversal pivot axis. The documents US-A-3107923 and CH-A-644557 disclose 
snow vehicles, in which the runner-carrying arms are 
connected with the vehicle frame by means of articulated 
parallelograms, which are deformed by manually rotating the 
hand grip means for steering and/or tilting the runners, 
without any other actuating means connecting the runners 
with the rotatable hand grip means. The purpose of the invention is to improve a snow 
vehicle of the kind described at the outset and in the 
preamble of claim 1, by using simple means and a robust, 
lightweight and relatively inexpensive construction to 
achieve the greatest possible comfort and ease of use and 
the utmost steering reliability. The invention achieves the above aims by a snow vehicle 
according to the preamble of claim 1 and characterized in 
that the runner-carrying arms are supported at the 
transverse ends of a front carriage subframe in the form of 
an articulated parallelogram which comprises two transverse 
arms positioned vertically one above the other and hinged at 
their mid points to the load-bearing part of the frame, in 
such a way that they can pivot about axes parallel with the 
longitudinal axis of the
