<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in the treatment
of mild as well as severe asthma and other respiratory
disorders. More particularly, it relates to the use of a
bronchodilator in combination with a steroidal antiinflammatory
drug for the treatment of respiratory
disorders such as asthma, and to pharmaceutical
compositions containing the two active ingredients. It
emphasizes the use of a long-acting bronchodilator which
provides rapid relief of symptoms.There have recently been significant advances in our
understanding of asthma. Despite many advances, both in
awareness of the disease by doctors and patients alike,
coupled with the introdction of very powerful and
effective anti-asthma drugs, asthma remains a poorly
understood and often poorly treated disease. Previously,
contraction of airway smooth muscles has been regarded as
the most important feature of asthma. Recently there has
been a marked change in the way asthma is managed,
stemming from the fact that asthma is recognized as a
chronic inflammatory disease. Uncontrolled airway
inflammation may lead to mucosal damage and structural
changes giving irrversible narrowing of the airways and
fibrosis of the lung tissue. Therapy should therefore be
aimed at controlling symptoms so that normal life is
possible and at the same time provide basis for treating 
the underlying inflammation.The most common cause for poor control of asthma is poor
compliance with the long-term management of chronic
asthma, particularly with prophylatic treatments, such as
inhaled steroids, which do not give immediate symptom
relief. Patients will readily take β2-agonist inhalers,
since these provide rapid relief of symptoms, but often
do not take prophylactic therapy, such as inhaled
steroids, regularly because there is no immediate
symptomatic benefit. They also counteract down regulation
of β2-adrenoceptor agonists.Formoterol, (N-[2-hydroxy-5-[1-hydroxy-2-[[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]
formamide), is an adrenoceptor agonist which selectively
stimulates β2-receptors, thus producing relaxation of
bronchial smooth muscle, inhibition of the release of
endogenous spasmogens, inhibition of oedema caused by
endogenous mediators, and increased mucociliary
clearence. Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts rapidly,
usually within minutes which gives the patient immediate
confirmation that he has taken an adequat dose and
thereby avoiding overdosing of both β-agonist and
steroid. Inhaled formoterol also exerts a prolonged
bronchodilation, which in clinical
