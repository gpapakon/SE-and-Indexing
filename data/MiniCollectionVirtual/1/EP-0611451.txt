<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a novel and improved method for the diagnosis, and continuing assessment, of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The protein encoded by a rabbit cDNA termed SQ10 is shown to be a molecular marker of squamous cell differentiation. By immunoblotting with antibodies raised against a 22 residue SQ10 synthetic peptide, SQ10 is shown not to be present in undifferentiated cells. SQ10 expression is up-regulated during the differentiation process and inhibited by retinoids. DNA and amino acid homologies between SQ10 and various preprorelaxin proteins allowed SQ10 to be identified as a preprorelaxin-like molecule. The SQ10 relaxin-like protein is secreted from squamous epithelial cells, and as such represents the first molecular marker of squamous cell differentiation that can be detected in body fluids. The rabbit SQ10-derived peptide was found to have a counterpart in human preprorelaxin, with the sequence MSTWSKRSLSQEDAPQTPRPV. Antibodies raised to a peptide of this sequence are also specific differentiated squamous cells. Such antibodies can be used to detect the presence of preprorelaxin-related molecules in normal and malignant squamous cells and in human biological samples and, importantly, in tissue fluids, and thus can be used in a diagnostic test for SCC.

<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD FOR DETECTING A DIFFERENTIATION MARKER IN NORMAL AND CARCINOMA CELLS AND IN BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES AND BODY FLUID.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to compositions and methods for the diagnosis of carcinomas, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, by the identification of intracellular and secreted molecular markers of squamous cell differentiation. In particular, the present invention relates to the use of antibodies directed against squamous cell carcinoma markers to detect the presence of such markers in normal and malignant squamous cells and in human biological samples and tissue fluids.2. Description of the Related Art.The normal tracheobronchial epithelium is a columnar pseudostratified epithelium that is continuously renewing itself (1,2). This epithelium is replaced by a stratified squamous epithelium under a variety of adverse conditions, such as mechanical injury, exposure to carcinogens or tumour promoters and vitamin A-deficiency (2) . This programme of squamous differentiation in tracheobronchial epithelial cells shares many biochemical and molecular characteristics with squamous 

 differentiation in other epithelia such as the skin (3,4).Recently, a multi-stage model has been proposed for the program of squamous differentiation (2,4) . In the first stage, cells become irreversibly growth-arrested. In normal cells irreversible growth arrest appears to be a prerequisite for the second stage of the differentiation program, namely the induction of the squamous differentiated phenotype. Squamous differentiation is influenced by several factors, including retinoids, transforming growth bl and phorbol esters (5,11,12). Retinoic acid, a vitamin A analogue, has been shown to act at a very specific stage in this differentiation program. It effectively suppresses the induction of squamous cell markers without blocking irreversible growth arrest (4-10) .Understanding the mechanism of aberrant squamous cell differentiation is of great interest due to the association between squamous metaplasia and of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in humans. This has led to the search for biochemical and molecular markers of differentiated squamous cells, which would be of use in cancer screening or monitoring. Several potential markers have been identified, the expression of which is believed to correlate with squamous cell differentiation. These include, transglutaminase type I mRNA and protein (5,6), cholesterol sulfotransf rase activity and consequent
