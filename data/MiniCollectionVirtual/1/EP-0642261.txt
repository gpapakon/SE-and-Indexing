<ABSTRACT>
In a horizontal deflection circuit output stage, a retrace 
pulse voltage is developed in a primary winding (X1) of a flyback 

transformer (T1) and transformer-coupled to a secondary winding 
and rectified for developing a high voltage (U). A portion (HV/3) 

of the transformer-coupled rectified voltage is combined in a 
voltage divider (200) with a second rectified voltage (VOUT). The 

second rectified voltage is produced in a peak rectifier (D2) from 
the retrace pulse voltage in the primary winding (X1) in a manner 

that bypasses the secondary winding. A screen grid voltage (VS) 
is developed at a terminal (200b) of the voltage divider. A change 

in beam current loading (iBEAM) produces variations in opposite 
sense in the combined rectified voltages in a manner to regulate 

the screen grid voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a power supply for a
television apparatus. In particular, the invention relates to a high
voltage power supply for generating a grid electrode voltage of a
cathode ray tube (CRT) such as a screen grid electrode.In a conventional television receiver, a horizontal
flyback transformer is coupled between a collector of a horizontal
output transistor and a DC power supply of a B+ supply voltage.
The horizontal output transistor is coupled between the flyback
transformer and ground, and conducts a current from the B+
power supply to energize the flyback transformer and produce a
sawtooth horizontal deflection current in the horizontal deflection
winding for repetitive horizontal scanning. The base of the
horizontal output transistor is coupled to a horizontal oscillator,
which controls a switching operation in the horizontal output
transistor. A retrace capacitor is coupled between the collector of
the horizontal output transistor and ground.At the collector of the horizontal output transistor and
on the retrace capacitor, a high voltage retrace pulse voltage of,
for example 1000V is developed, during retrace. The flyback
transformer is, typically, used for providing high voltage AC input
needed for a high voltage DC power supply. By suitable turns
ratios between primary and secondary windings of the flyback
transformer, a high voltage is generated in the transformer and
rectified to produce an ultor voltage, during retrace.In one prior art arrangement as disclosed in US-A-4 088 928, a rectifier coupled to the
collector of the horizontal output transistor produces from the
retrace pulse voltage a DC voltage that is coupled to the screen
grid of the CRT. Increased beam loading may cause the peak
voltage at the collector to increase and, hence, the DC voltage at
the screen grid to increase.In another prior art television receiver as disclosed in US-A-4 631 512, the screen grid
voltage is developed at a terminal of a voltage divider that is
responsive to a rectified high voltage produced from the high
voltage winding of the flyback transformer and is approximately
equal to one third of the ultor voltage. A portion of the rectified
high voltage that is developed across the voltage divider provides
the screen grid voltage. In a television receiver that does not have an ultor
voltage regulator, an increase in beam current loading produces a
decrease in the high voltage at the secondary winding of the
flyback transformer and, hence in the screen grid voltage. It may
be desirable to regulate
