<ABSTRACT>
In a control apparatus for a hydraulically operated 
vehicular transmission 
(1) which has a plurality of 
hydraulic engaging elements (C1 - C4), an orifice (30) is 

disposed in an oil passage (L2) which is communicated with 
a hydraulic engaging element (C1) for a low-speed 

transmission train (G1). The control apparatus has a 
bypass passage (L2b) which bypasses the orifice (30), a 

control valve (13) which can be changed over between a 
communicated state in which the bypass passage (L2b) is in 

communication and a cut-off state in which the 
communication of the bypass passage (L2b) is cut off, and 

a control circuit (10) which changes over the control 
valve (13) to the communicated state under a predetermined 

condition at a time of changing over from a running range 
(D) to a neutral range (N).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control apparatus for a 
hydraulically operated vehicular transmission which has a 
plurality of hydraulic engaging elements such as clutches, brakes, 
or the like, according to the preamble of claim 1. A control apparatus of this kind is known from the US-A-5005444. 
When the vehicle speed is changed, the speed of rotation 
NO of the output shaft of the transmission varies and the time T2 
for completion of shifting is accelerated (or shortened). 
Therefore, the cut-off condition prior to this time T2 is brought 
into the communicated state at an early time by N0, which may 
produce in-gear shocks. A further control apparatus is known from US-A-5090270. There, 
in an oil passage which leads to a hydraulic engaging element for 
a low-speed transmission train, there is disposed an orifice as 
well as a check valve for oil discharging which is in parallel 
with the orifice. There is also provided a bypass passage which 
bypasses the orifice and in this bypass passage there is 
interposed a gate valve to open and close it. At the time of 
changing over from a neutral range to a running range (i.e., at 
an in-gear time or at the time of gear engagement), the gate valve 
is opened under a predetermined condition. In the above-described prior art, its object lies in 
alleviating the in-gear shocks (i.e., shocks at the time  
 
of gear engagement) by adjusting the speed of hydraulic 
oil supply to the hydraulic engaging element for the low-speed 
transmission train at the time of gear engagement. 
It does not however take into consideration at all the 
off-gear shocks (i.e., shocks at the time of gear 
disengagement) which occur at the time of changing over 
from the running range to the neutral range (i.e., at the 
time of gear disengagement). Off-gear shocks are the shocks that occur in the 
following manner. Namely, when the vehicle is stopped in 
the running range, the driving unit made up of an engine 
and a transmission displaces in posture while elastically 
deforming engine mounting elements by the driving reaction 
forces due to the power transmission via the low-speed 
transmission train and then, at the time of changing over 
to the neutral range, the driving unit returns from the 
displaced state to the normal position, at which time does 
occur the off-gear shocks. In the above-described prior 
art, the off-gear shocks occur on the following occasion. 
Namely, at the time of gear disengagement, the hydraulic 
oil pressure in the hydraulic engaging element for the

A control apparatus for a hydraulically operated vehicular 
transmission (1) having a plurality of hydraulic engaging 

elements (C1-C4), said control apparatus comprising: 

flow restricting means (30) disposed in an oil passage 
(L2) which is communicated with a hydraulic engaging element 

(C1) for a low-speed transmission train (G1); 
a bypass passage (L2b) which bypasses said flow 
restricting means (30);

in communication and a cut-off state in which the 
communication of said bypass passage (L2b) is cut off; and 
control means which changes over said control valve (13) 
to the cut-off state at an initial stage of changing over 

from a running range (D) to a neutral range (N) and then 
changes over said control valve (13) to the communicated 

state at a succeeding predetermined stage,

said control means is arranged such that said control valve 

(13) is changed over to the communicated state, from the 
initial stage of changing over to the neutral range (N),
