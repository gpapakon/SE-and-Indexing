<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air conditioner and more
particularly to an air conditioner for performing room air-conditioning
efficiently irrespective of the direction of blowing
of thermoregulated air.It is general that an air conditioner set up for a structure
or building such as a house, or the like, is constituted by an
interior equipment set up in the interior of the structure, that
is, indoors, and an exterior equipment set up in the exterior of
the structure.Fig. 13 shows an interior equipment 91 constituting an air
conditioner 90. The interior equipment 91 has a housing 92 shaped
substantially like a rectangular parallelepiped so as to extend in
the direction of the depth in the drawing. The housing 92 is
mounted on a wall surface 93 in the interior of a room. The
interior equipment 91 is mounted on a position near a ceiling 94 in
order to make efficient use of interior space.The interior equipment 91 premised on the aforementioned
setting-up form employs a structure in which interior air can be
sucked in from the upper part of the housing 92 and blown out into
the room from the lower part of the housing 92 in order to perform
room air-conditioning efficiently.Specifically, the housing 92 of the interior equipment 91 has 
an air inlet 95 provided at the upper part thereof, and an air
outlet 96 provided at the lower front surface (opposite to the wall
surface 93) thereof.The air inlet 95 and the air outlet 96 are connected to each
other through an air passage 97 provided in the housing 92 so that
air having flown in through the air inlet 95 flows out through the
air outlet 96. A heat exchanger 98 which is a heat exchanging
means and a cross flow fan 99 which is an air blowing means are
disposed in the air passage 97. A blowout passage 97A curved from
just under the cross flow fan 99 toward the air outlet 96 is formed
in the downstream side of the air passage 97.The air outlet 96 is provided with a wind direction plate 101
for changing the direction of blowing of thermoregulated air such
as cooled air, heated air, or the like, to be blown out to an
opening portion 100 through the air outlet 96.As shown in Fig. 14, the wind direction plate 101 is shaped
substantially like a belt continuing along the direction of the
length (the direction perpendicular to the paper in the drawing) of
the housing 92 and is made rotatable around a pivot 102 which is
provided in the housing 92 so as to be parallel with the wall
surface 93. The range of rotation of the wind direction plate 101
is set to be from a
