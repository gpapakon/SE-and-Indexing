<ABSTRACT>
A planar magnetron sputtering device with improved target utilisation and 
cooling capacity is provided. The device includes a magnet yoke (100) as the main 

structure of the cathode body. The magnet yoke (100) is made of low 
carbon steel 

which provides magnetic shunt and physical strength. The target (105) 
is attached to 

a metal backing plate (110) so that the side surface of the target is 
substantially flush 

with the side surface of the backing plate. Suitable magnets 
(121,122,123) are adapted for 

producing a closed-loop magnetic field over the lower surface (106) 
of the target. 

The magnets include an outer magnet (121,123) that has an annular 
structure positioned 

around an inner elongated magnet (122). The outer magnets (121,123) 
are positioned along the 

perimeter of the backing plate and small magnets are employed to create larger 
active target area. The magnet yoke (100) also comprises extension 

structures (101a,103a) which 
are positioned along the side surface of the target. These extensions 

(101a,103a) shunt the 
magnetic field at the edges of the target (105). The planar magnetron 

demonstrates 
improved target utilisation and deposits more uniform films.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus for sputtering films onto a
substrate, and more particularly to a planar magnetron sputtering apparatus that
demonstrates improved target utilisation.Sputtering is the physical ejection of material from a target as a result of ion
bombardment of the target. The ions are usually created by collisions between
gas atoms and electrons in a glow discharge. The ions are accelerated into the
target cathode by an electric field. A substrate is placed in a suitable location
so that it intercepts a portion of the ejected atoms. Thus, a coating of target
material is deposited on the surface of the substrate.In an endeavor to attain increased deposition rates, magnetically enhanced
targets have been used. For a planar magnetron, the cathode includes an array
of permanent magnets arranged in a closed loop and mounted in a fixed position
in relation to the flat target plate. Thus, the magnetic field is caused to travel in
a closed loop, commonly referred to as a "race track," which establishes the
path or region along which sputtering of the target material takes place. For a
rectangular shaped target, the "race track" has a characteristic oval
configuration wherein the erosion pattern in the target appears as a circular
trough directly under the peak of the magnetic field lines. In a magnetron
cathode, a magnetic field confines the glow discharge plasma and increases the
path length of the electrons moving under the influence of the electric field.
This results in an increase in the gas atom- electron collision probability. This
leads to a much higher sputtering rate than that obtained without the use of
magnetic confinement. Further, the sputtering process can be accomplished at
a much lower gas pressure.Heat generated during sputtering must be removed to insure adequate
performance of the planar magnetron, but effective heat removal is often
difficult to achieve in conventional planar magnetrons. This problem stems in
part from the design of planar magnetrons wherein the cathode comprises a
basic cathode body (or core) typically having one or two channels each of
which is flanked by the sides of the core. Each channel houses permanent
magnets that are connected by a magnet yoke. A planar target is positioned in 
proximity to the poles of the permanent magnets so that the target covers a
substantial part of the channel. See, for example, Aichert et al., U.S. Patent
4,572,776, issued February 25, 1986. By positioning the magnets in the
channel of the core, the core
