such as a hand-held computer, driven by a rechargeable battery (102) and a data

communication adaptor (2) for enabling communication between the portable
terminal unit and a host computer of the system, the terminal unit and the data

communication adaptor are designed to minimize the size thereof in the following
five ways. First, a memory card holding mechanism (60) for connecting the

memory card (3) of the portable terminal unit is provided between a swinging back
lid (6) and a recess of the back casing. Second, a normal interface (101) and a

high-speed interface (105) are both provided in the portable terminal unit and the
data communication adaptor respectively. Third, an auxiliary connector (16) for an

optional device to extend a function of the portable terminal unit is provided in the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
information processing system using a portable terminal 
unit and a data communication adapter therefor. In recent years, portable terminal units such 
as hand-held terminals (HHTs) are widely used for 
managing commodities, reading gas and electric meters, 
and the like. Generally, a hand-held terminal has a keyboard 
to input data, a display such as a liquid crystal 
display, and a printer. Various data are entered into 
the hand-held terminal, and the entered data are 
displayed. Since the hand-held terminal is hand-carried, 
it is designed to be compact and light. A hand-held 
terminal often employs a memory card such as an IC card 
as an external storage medium. The memory card stores 
data entered into the hand-held terminal. The memory 
card is usually installed in the hand-held terminal from 
an upper end or a lower end thereof by a memory card 
loading mechanism installed therein. However, the locations of the keyboard, the 
display, and the printer are more or less limited due to 
the method of use conditions thereof. Further, the 
hand-held terminal usually incorporates a battery, a 
modem for communicating data to a larger apparatus, and 
a connector for connecting the hand-held terminal to 
the larger apparatus whose position is generally fixed. 
Accordingly, the position for inserting the memory card 
is also limited and the width and thickness of the hand-held 
terminal may be increased by the installation of 
the memory card, thus having a negative effect on the  
 
compactness of the hand-held terminal. In addition to designing a hand-held terminal 
that is compact and light, the hand-held terminal is 
required to have high-performance. Usually, the hand-held 
terminal is provided with an optical connector to 
communicate with a larger apparatus by using a 
transmission adapter. That is, the data input into the 
hand-held terminal are transmitted to a larger 
apparatus by connecting the hand-held terminal to a 
transmission adapter. Conventionally, when the hand-held terminal 
communicates with the higher apparatus, an RS232C 
interface is used. Further, to reduce the size of the 
hand-held terminal, the prior art multiplexes RS232C 
interface signals and uses a pair of light emitting and 
receiving elements to send and receive data. If the 
hand-held terminal employs a large capacity memory, it 
must employ a high-speed interface to transmit data at 
high speed. High-speed data transmission can be realized 
by employing a new interface and a
