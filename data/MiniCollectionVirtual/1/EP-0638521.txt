<ABSTRACT>
In the dewatering of sludges in a dewatering apparatus (10) in which the sludges are first mechanically dewatered in a centrifuge (15) and are then subsequently further thermally dewatered in a pulverising dryer whose housing (11) encloses the centrifuge (15), there is the risk of encrustation of particles of thick matter on the centrifuge bowl casing (13). According to the invention, the centrifuge (15) is surrounded by a stationary shell (12) and the drying gases laden with the particles of thick matter are conducted in the annular duct (16) formed from the shell (12) and the dryer housing (11).

<CLAIMS>
A drainage device for removing water from sludge, by means of a full-cylinder 
centrifuge, preferably a full-cylinder helical conveyor centrifuge, for 

the separation of a sludge-like solid-liquid mixture to yield a slurry with a 
residual water component in the range of approximately 60% by weight to 

approximately 85% by weight, with an inlet for the feed of the sludge-like 
solid-liquid mixture and with at least one outlet for the separated liquid and 

one outlet for the separated slurry, wherein the slurry discharge zone of the 
centrifuge is the dispersion organ of a spray drier, with means to divert the 

flight path of the radially-ejected slurry particles, in dispersed form as 
streams of particles, in the axial direction of the full-cylinder centrifuge, 


characterised in that
 within the fixed drier housing (11) the centrifuge 
cylinder jacket (13) is enveloped by a fixed jacket (12) which terminates at 

a distance from the slurry discharge zone (14) of the centrifuge (15) and 
forms an annular channel (20) with the drier housing (11) through which the 

slurry particles spun off by the centrifuge are channelled with the drying 
gases. 
A drainage device (10) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the jacket 
(12) is secured at its rear end to the rear end wall (19) of the drier housing 

(11) and the front central section of the jacket (12) is braced via means (16) 
at a distance from the drier housing (11).
