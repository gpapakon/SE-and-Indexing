<ABSTRACT>
An operating method for a hybrid car which has 
an electric motor for driving the vehicle and an 

internal combustion-engine for power generation. Upon 
completion of the activation of a catalyst, the engine 

is operated in warm-up mode with a small throttle 
valve opening, and when the output of a water 

temperature gauge thereafter reaches a predetermined 
value and the warm-up operation is complete, the 

engine is operated with a large throttle valve opening 
for the power generation. Thus, the hybrid car can 

enjoy improved exhaust gas characteristics and 
increased cruising range and power performances. If 

it is determined that the storage amount of a battery 
is smaller than a predetermined storage amount when a 

starter key is so operated as to stop the vehicle, an 

alarm lamp is lighted, thus informing the driver of 
engine operation, and the engine operation is 

continued until the predetermined battery storage 
amount is reached or a predetermine time elapses from 

the start of the engine operation, whereby the battery 
is reliably charged. Accordingly, the battery can be 

reliably charged with power necessary to start the 
vehicle, and the cruising range and power performances 

of the vehicle are improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hybrid car 
provided with an electric motor used to drive the 
vehicle and an internal combustion engine for power 
generation, and more particularly, to an operating 
method for an internal combustion engine for power 
generation of a hybrid car, which method permits an 
increased cruising range and improved power 
performances of the vehicle without abandoning an 
advantage of an electric car that the exhaust gas 
characteristics are excellent. Recently, the regulations on exhaust gas from 
those vehicles which use an internal combustion engine 
as their drive source have been made more rigorous to 
tackle environmental pollution. In this respect, 
various new technologies have been developed. 
Electric cars, which use an electric motor as their 
drive source and produce no exhaust gas, should be 
ideal motor vehicles for reduction of the exhaust gas 
amount. Typical electric cars are designed so that a 
battery is used to supply the electric motor with 
electric power. Naturally, however, the available 
battery capacity for each vehicle is limited, so that 
the power performance is poorer and the cruising 
range is shorter than those of the vehicles which use 
an internal combustion engine as the drive source. In 
order to make electric cars more popular, these 
technical problems are expected to be solved. Hybrid cars, which are furnished with a 
generator, driven by an internal combustion engine,  
 
for battery charging, are believed to be promising modern 
electric cars which can enjoy an increased cruising range. GB-A 623 986 discloses a hybrid vehicle in which, under high 
load conditions, the electric motor is driven partly by the 
battery and partly by a reciprocating or turbine engine, while 
under low load conditions, or after the vehicle has stopped, 
the engine recharges the battery. Generally, hybrid cars are equipped with an exhaust gas 
purifier for improving the emission characteristics of the 
engine. If, however, the engine operation is started, in order 
to charge the battery, before the catalyst of the exhaust gas 
purifier is activated, the emission characteristics of the 
engine are spoiled. EP-A 0 511 654, which was published after 
the convention priority date of the present application, 
discloses a hybrid vehicle in which engine operation is 
prevented while the catalytic converter is pre-heated to a 
first threshold by a power from the battery. The catalytic 
converter is subsequently heated further by power from the 
regenerative braking
