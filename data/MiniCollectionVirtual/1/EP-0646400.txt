<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dissolved oxygen
reducing apparatus wherein the content of oxygen dissolved
in liquids is reduced.In semiconductor manufacturing processes, for example, pure
water is used in large amounts for the cleaning treatment
of semiconductor devices. Pure water is intended to mean
water which contains a small amount of impurities.
Actually, a small amount of oxygen is contained in pure
water as an impurity.If oxygen is present, even at a very low concentration, in
pure water used for cleaning treatment, a native oxide film
is formed on the surfaces of the semiconductor device,
thereby causing the device characteristics to deteriorate.
For pure water used in semiconductor manufacturing
processes, or for pure water for semiconductors, there is a
demand to reduce the concentration of dissolved oxygen to a
level lower than 10 ppb.Hitherto, vacuum degassing apparatuses have been frequently
employed as a dissolved oxygen reducing apparatus.
However, such apparatuses are disadvantageous in that the
dissolved oxygen can be reduced to a concentration as high
as approximately 100 ppb, that the apparatus is large in
size, and that power costs are great, resulting in
economically poor situation. In recent years, attention 
has been directed to a dissolved oxygen reducing apparatus
using an inert gas bubbling method, which is free from the
above disadvantages.In the inert gas bubbling method, while untreated water
(water to be treated) flows down in a bubbling vessel, an
inert gas is jetted in the form of bubbles from the lower
portion of the bubbling vessel, so that the water and the
inert gas are subjected to gas-liquid contact to substitute
the oxygen gas in the water for the inert gas, thereby
eliminating oxygen from the water. The bubbling vessel and
the pipes through which the liquid is passed are formed of
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is a kind of plastic. PVC
is excellent in its ease of availability, economy,
mechanical strength, corrosion resistance and the like, and
it has been used for almost all the general-purpose piping
for water.According to the inert gas bubbling method, the
concentration of dissolved oxygen in a liquid can be
readily reduced to lower than 100 ppb and may be reduced to
approximately 10 ppb, but has never been reduced to lower
than 10 ppb.In recent semiconductor manufacturing processes, there are
some cases where it is desirable to utilize pure water
having a concentration of dissolved oxygen of lower than 10
ppb, in specific steps such as cleaning of the
