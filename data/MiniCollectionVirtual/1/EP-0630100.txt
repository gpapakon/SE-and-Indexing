<ABSTRACT>
An amplifier arrangement comprises an inverting transconductance stage 
(8) having an input (4) and an output (6); a capacitor (2) coupled between the input (4) 

and the output (6) of the inverting transconductance stage (8); and signal current means 
(14) having a first output (16) coupled to the input (4) of the inverting transconductance 

stage (8) to provide a first signal current to the input (4) of the inverting transconductance 
stage (8). The signal current means (14) further comprises a second output 

(18) coupled to the output (6) of the inverting transconductance stage (8) to provide a 
second signal current to the output (6) of the inverting transconductance stage (8), 

which second signal current is substantially equal and in phase opposition to the first 
signal current. A second parallel path (20) bypasses the Miller-compensated 

transconductance stage (8) to eliminate the right half-plane zero of the Miller 
compensation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an amplifier arrangement comprising an inverting
transconductance stage having an input and an output for providing an output voltage Uout; a
capacitor coupled between the input and the output of the inverting transconductance stage;
and signal current means having a first output coupled to the input of the inverting
transconductance stage to provide a first signal current Iin to the input of the inverting
transconductance stage, the signal current means further comprising a second output coupled
to the output of the inverting transconductance stage to provide a second signal current to the
output of the inverting transconductance stage, which second signal current is substantially in
phase opposition and substantially equal in magnitude to the first signal current.Such an amplifier arrangement is known from US 4 980 651 which discloses a
DC-coupled multistage operational amplifier, the participation of the multiple stages of
which, in defining the effective gain of the amplifier, is frequency dependent, such that high
frequency signals are amplified by a single high speed stage and coupled directly to an output
port. Low frequencies, on the other hand, are coupled through both the high speed stage and a
low frequency precision stage connected in cascade with the high speed stage. Tuning
capacitors are coupled to the low frequency precision stage resulting in a transfer function of
the operational amplifier containing two primary poles at frequencies below a frequency at
which unity gain occurs and a zero at less than the unity gain frequency and greater than the
frequencies of the poles. The theoretical background of such an amplifier arrangement is known, for example, from a paper by
P.R. Gray et al., "MOS Operational Amplifier Design - A Tutorial Overview", IEEE
Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC-17, No. 6, December 1982, pp. 969-982. A
very well known and widespread frequency-compensation method for amplifiers is
Miller compensation or pole splitting, as shown in Fig. 1. Placing a Miller capacitor 2
between the input 4 and the output 6 of an inverting transconductance stage 8 splits the
input and output poles caused by the capacitances 10 and 12 at the input 4 and the
output 6, resulting in a well-controlled 20 dB/decade frequency roll-off. The
transconductance stage 8 is driven by a signal source 14 having an output 16 coupled to
the input 4 to supply a signal current Iin to the transconductance stage. Fig. 2 shows a
simple Miller-compensated amplifier in which the
