<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for positioning in time transactions between a transmission/reception system and previously detected targets. A transaction (I1, F1) consists of an interrogation pulse (I1) transmitted by the system followed by an associated reception window (F1) intended to receive the response from the target to which the associated interrogation pulse was sent. The length of a transaction being defined by the delay between its interrogation pulse and its reception window, the transactions are classified and set in position according to their descending distances or radars. The reception window (Fi) of each transaction is positioned immediately before the window (Fi-1) of the transaction of immediately lower rank as long as its associated pulse (Ii) does not overlap a previously positioned transaction interrogation pulse. In the contrary case, the transaction (Ii, Fi) is repositioned within the previously positioned transactions (I1,F1,I2,F2,...Ii-1,Fi-1) until it no longer overlaps an interrogation pulse or a reception window for these previously positioned transactions, the transaction being positioned after all the previously positioned windows if a position without overlap is not found. Application: positioning in time of transactions between an S-mode secondary radar and aeroplanes.

Method for the placing, in time, of transactions
between a transmission/reception system and targets

detected beforehand, a transaction (I
i
, F
i
) being constituted
by one or more interrogation pulses (I
i
) sent out
by the system followed by one or more associated reception

windows (F
i
) designed to receive the response from
the target that has been sent the associated interrogation

pulse (I
i
), the length of a transaction being
defined by the delay between its pulse (I
i
) and its
window (F
i
), the transactions being ranked and positioned
according to their decreasing lengths, characterized in

that the reception window (F
i
) of each transaction is
placed immediately before the window (F
i-1
) of the immediately
lower-ranking transaction so long as its associated

pulse (I
i
) does not overlap an interrogation pulse
(I
i-1
) of a previously-placed transaction and in that if
the contrary is the case, the transaction (I
i
, F
i
) is
shifted within the previously-placed transactions, the

interrogation pulse (I
i
) being placed at the earliest
point in time until there is no longer any overlapping

(31) between its pulse (I
i
) or its window (F
i
) and an
interrogation pulse or a reception window of these

previously-placed transactions, the transaction (I
i
, F
i
)
being placed after all the previously-placed windows (F
1
,
F
2
, F
3
, F
4
, F
5
) if a place without overlapping is not
found.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the transaction (I
i
, F
i
) is shifted within previously-placed
transactions so that it is successively 

placed at the limits of these previously-placed transactions,
starting from the earliest-placed transaction (I
1
).
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the placing at the limits includes at least one of

the following four steps:

in a first step, the reception window (F
i
) of
the transaction is placed immediately after 
the interrogation
pulse (I
i-1
) of a previously-placed transaction
(I
i-1
, F
i-1
);
in a second step, the interrogation pulse (I
i
)
of the transaction is placed immediately after the

interrogation pulse (I
i-1
) of the previously-placed
transaction;
in a third step, the reception window (F
i
) of
the transaction is placed immediately after the reception

window (F
i-1
) of the previously-placed transaction;
in a fourth step, the interrogation pulse (I
i
)
of the transaction is placed immediately after the

reception window (F
i-1
) of the previously-placed transaction.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the placing at the limits includes at least one of

the following four steps:

in a first step, the reception window (F
i
) of
the transaction is placed immediately before the interrogation

pulse (I
i-1
) of a previously-placed transaction
(I
i-1
, F
i-1
);
in a second step, the interrogation pulse (I
i
)
of the transaction is placed immediately before the

interrogation pulse (I
i-1
) of the previously-placed
transaction;
in a third step, the reception window (F
i
) of
the transaction is placed immediately before the reception

window (F
i-1
) of the previously-placed transaction;
in a fourth step, the interrogation pulse (I
i
)
of the transaction is placed immediately before the

reception window (F
i-1
) of the previously-placed transaction.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the transaction (I
i
, F
i
) is shifted within previously-placed
transactions according to a pitch (Δ)

starting from the pulse (I
1
) of the earliest-placed
transaction.
Method according to any one of the previous
claims characterized in that, with several interrogation

pulses (I
1
, I
2
, I
6
) or reception windows (F
6
) already
having transpired, a new transaction (I
7
, F
7
) is placed
by placing at the limits of already-placed transactions

which have not yet transpired until there is no longer
any overlapping (31) between the new transaction (I
7
, F
7
)
and the previously-placed transactions.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5
characterized in that, with several interrogation pulses

(I
1
, I
2
, I
6
) or reception windows (F
6
) already having
transpired, a new transaction (I
7
, F
7
) is placed by
shifting from an instant at the earliest point in time

(t'o+Δ ), within transactions that have already been
placed and have not yet transpired, according to a pitch

(Δ) until there is no longer any overlapping (31) between
the new transaction (I
7
, F
7
) and the previously-placed
transactions.
