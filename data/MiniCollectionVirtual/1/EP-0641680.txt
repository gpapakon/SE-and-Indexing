<CLAIMS>
Device for lubrication of beads of tyres before they are mounted on 
the wheels, characterised by the fact that it comprises a vertical 

supporting member (10), two lubricant sprayers (2, 4) integral with 
said supporting member, one fixed (2) and one moveable (4), which 

supply jets of lubricant (6, 7), a jet deflector element (5) carried by 
the moveable sprayer (4) and a means (3) for recovery of the 

excess lubricant. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
nozzles of the sprayers (2, 4) deliver a conically diverging jet. 
Device according to all of the preceding claims, characterised by 
the fact that the deflector (5), of conical configuration, is fixed on a 

vertically mobile support (11) and that the latter carries the sprayer 
(4) for the upper bead of a tyre (1) arranged horizontally between 

the two fixed and moveable sprayers (2, 4). 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised 
by the fact that a recovery tank (3) for the excess lubricant is 

arranged below the sprayer (2) for the lower bead of the tyre (1).
