portions (32 and 30), a front wall defining a ball-striking 

face, and top and bottom walls, the bottom 
wall characterized as having a medial ridge (60), and 

as forming two shallow recesses (162,164), one recess 
(164) between the ridge and the heel portion, and the 

other recess (162) between the ridge and the toe 
portion, the recesses everywhere spaced rearwardly 

from the front wall, the one recess having an arcuate

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a golf club head comprising 
a shell having toe and heel portions, a front wall defining 
a ball-striking face, and top and bottom walls, said bottom 
wall having a medial ridge. An example of such a golf club head, is shown in US-A-4,313,607 
which discloses reinforced metallic golf club 
head comprising: 
(a) a metallic shell having the exterior form of the 
head, the shell extending about a hollow, (b) the head having a front wall with a front face 
adapted to strike a golf ball, and other wall structure 
rearward of a plane defined by the face, (c) and a strut extending in the hollow between the 
front wall and the other wall structure to transmit loading 
therebetween in response to the ball striking the front 
face, thereby to resist deformation of the front wall. It is said the strut may be located generally above a 
keel on the head and reinforcement ribbing may be provided 
on the front wall of the head. In one embodiment of US-A-4,313,607 the downwardly 
projecting keel extends rearwardly relative to the front 
face. The keel has a downwardly convex lowermost surface 
which is forwardly and rearwardly elongated to extend 
toward the rearward-most portion of the head. Also the 
lower surface of the head has underside faces at opposite  
 
sides of the keel, and which have downward concavity, those 
faces merging with opposite sides of the keel. It is 
stated that in use, if there is contact of the head with 
the ground, the only (or major) area of contact is defined 
by the keel. The concave faces 19 and 20 are said to set 
up a favourable air flow adjacent the underside of the head 
as it is swung, and the keel splits the air flow which 
tends to separate and bend the grass as the head approaches 
the ball, rather than crush the grass as a conventional 
flat bottomed head does.  
 The present invention is as claimed in the claims. 
Some aspects of the invention 
relate generally to 
increasing the size of metallic, hollow golf club heads 
(woods) without increasing head weight. More 
particularly, it concerns the distribution of ball 
impact waves from the head front wall in such manner as 
to resist deflection of that front wall and to absorb 
such shock waves on top, bottom, and rear walls. Large, very thin-walled, metal golf club 
heads present the problems of cracking and buckling of 
metal walls, and excessive front wall deflection, 
during ball impact. There is need to alter the manner 
in which shock waves are distributed within metal wood 
walls, as by

portion (30), and the other recess (162) having an arcuate 

peripheral edge (162c) generally convex toward the toe 
portion (30), said recesses located at opposite sides of a 

forwardly extending vertical plane bisecting said ridge 
(60), the ridge being forwardly elongated and having a 

forwardmost extent with forwardly diverging wall surfaces 
(60a, 60b) located respectively at opposite sides of said 

plane, said diverging wall surfaces (60a, 60b) diverging 
toward and in proximity to said front wall (28a), the 

ridge (60) having a rearwardmost extent with rearwardly 
diverging wall surfaces at opposite sides of said plane, 

there being a curved rearward edge (56a) between said 
rearwardly diverging wall surfaces, said curved rearward 

edge (56a) being convex toward and distal from said front 
wall (28a), the ridge having a bottom surface extending 

forwardly and rearwardly at substantially the same level 
between said ridge forwardmost extent and said convex 

rearward edge (56a).  
 
A golf club head (14) as claimed in claim 1 
said recesses (164, 162) being elongate in 

directions rearwardly of said front wall (28
a
) whereby the 
medial ridge (60) is also rearwardly elongate between the 

recesses (164, 162) 
and said recesses (164, 162) having 

rearward surfaces (162' and 164')inclined forwardly and 
upwardly so as to be engageable by the turf moving 

relatively rearwardly, whereby lift forces are creatable 
at opposite sides of the medial ridge (60) urging the 

bottom wall (22) and head (14) in an upward direction. 
A golf club head as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in
