<ABSTRACT>
The capsular heat-radiating base (12) for a stainless steel cooking 
utensil (10) is characterised in that the lateral wall of the external 

stainless steel covering (18) of the capsular base which faces the 
utensil is perforated to allow the metal of good conductivity 

contained within the capsular base to be seen, the perforations (22) 
having a configuration such as to form on the outer lateral 

surface of said capsular base the required graphic elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to capsular heat-radiating bases for 
stainless steel cooking utensils, ie those bases consisting of the 
stainless steel base wall of the actual utensil plus a plate of 
good thermal conductivity metal and a stainless steel layer 
completely covering this plate, the entire assembly forming one 
piece with the utensil. The said covering for the plate of good 
conductivity is therefore in the shape of a cup, the lateral wall 
of which covers and delimits the lateral edge of said plate. It can be very useful, not only in the case of cooking utensils 
used industrially but also for normal domestic cooking utensils, 
to be able to immediately identify at a glance the origin of and 
the intended use for a certain utensil, especially when obligatory 
(as required for industrial purposes) or advisable to always use a particular utensil for the same function. 
A cooking utensile with a capsular base according to the preamble 
of claim 1 is known from document EP-A-481303. If the various utensils to be used for different purposes have the 
same shape and size, it becomes very difficult to quickly and 
reliably identify a particular utensil. It would therefore be 
very useful to be able to differentiate between the various 
utensils so that they are immediately identifiable. The 
requirement of immediately identifying a specific utensil also 
exists where various utensils of identical or similar shape and 
dimensions but formed from a different type of stainless steel 
have to be used. This requirement mainly exists industrially, but 
is also useful for domestic utensils, for example to differentiate  
 
with certainty between a utensil heatable by magnetic induction 
(the base of which is formed totally or partly of magnetizable 
stainless steel) and a conventional utensil of stainless steel. Stainless steel cooking utensils sometimes carry writing and/or a 
symbol impressed on the outer surface of the utensil base, 
normally in its centre, to indicate its origin and/or use. However in order to see this the utensil has to be raised from the 
surface on which it rests, so that the identification of a 
specific utensil is not immediate. Because of the considerable commercial availability of stainless 
steel saucepans and the large number of manufacturers, such 
manufacturers require to characterise their products by visual 
differences. In this respect, it is important to the manufacturer 
that his own products are immediately distinguishable from those 
of the competition without it being

<CLAIMS>
A stainless-steel cooking utensile (10;30;60;80) with a capsular 
base (12;32;62;82), the latter comprising, aside from the 

substantially flat stainless-steel base wall (34;64;84) of the 
utensile, a good thermal-conductivity metal plate (16;36;66;86) 

covering the outer surface of the base wall (34;64;84) of the 
utensile (10;30;60;80), and a stainless steel layer (18;38;68;88) 

covering both the flat surface of the plate (16;36;66;86) opposed to 
the plate's surface in contact with the base wall (34;64;84) of the 

utensile, and the lateral surface of the plate (16;36;66;86); the 
base wall of the utensile, the plate and the covering layer forming 

an integral assembly, characterised in that the lateral wall 
(20;40;70;90) of the covering layer (18;38;68;88), in contact with 

the lateral surface of the plate (16;36;66;86), is perforated 
(22;42,44,46,48,50;72;92) to allow the metal (16;36;66;86) having 

good thermal conductivity to be seen; the perforations 
(22;42,44,46,48,50;72;92) having a configuration forming graphic 

elements. 
A stainless-steel cooking utensile (10;30;60;80) according to claim 1, wherein a third 
metal is interposed between the good thermal-conductivity metal 

plate (16;36;66;86) and the stainless-steel covering layer 
(18;38;68;88). 
A stainless-steel cooking utensile (10;30;60;80) according to 
claim 2, wherein the third metal is in the form of a sheet.  

 
A stainless-steel cooking utensile (10;30;60;80) according to 
claims 2 or 3, wherein the third metal is provided only in 

correspondence of the perforations (22;42,44,46,48,50;72;92). 
A stainless-steel cooking utensile (10;30;60;80) according to any 
of the preceeding claims, wherein the metal having good conductivity 

is aluminium. 
A stainless-steel cooking utensile (10;30;60;80) according to any 
of the preceeding claims 2-5, wherein the third metal is copper or 

titanium.
