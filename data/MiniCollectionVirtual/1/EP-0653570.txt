<ABSTRACT>
In order to increase the sealability of blind rivets 
provided with a plastics sheath, the outer surface of a 

rivet body is formed with a circumferential groove (15) and 
the inner surface of a tubular sheath (10) is formed with a 

raised portion (17) fitting into the groove (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blind rivet capable 
of fastening a plurality of panels from one direction. Known blind rivets comprise a hollow rivet body and a 
mandrel inserted in the rivet body. With the mandrel head 
first, the blind rivet is inserted into mounting holes of 
panels to cause the flange of the rivet body to come in 
surface-contact with a panel. Then, the mandrel is pulled 
by a tool so strongly that the mandrel is broken at a 
small-diameter portion whereby the diametrically enlarged 
head of the mandrel buckles the rivet body shank to be 
expanded in order to connect a plurality of panels to each 
other by means of the buckled portion of the shank and the 
flange. The blind rivet is convenient in that the fastening 
operation is carried out from one direction. It is current 
practice to enhance the sealability of the connected portion 
by covering the rivet body of the blind rivet with a plastic 
cover and fastening the cover together with the rivet body 
to the panels. To cover the rivet body of the blind rivet with a 
plastic cover and fasten them is preferable since it 
enhances sealability as stated above. However, the 
connection between the cover and the rivet body is weak and 
it gives rise to a problem that the cover tends to come off 
in the process of distribution. When the blind rivet is 
re-inserted from a wrong mounting hole to a correct mounting 
hole, the cover also tends to come off from the blind rivet. 
Further, since a cover on the rivet body increases the 
outside diameter of the rivet body, a blind rivet having a 
considerably small diameter must be used if mounting holes 
are small and it is hard to obtain the same fastening force  
 
as with a cover-less rivet body that can be used in such 
mounting holes. Accordingly, the present invention aims to provide a 
blind rivet which can be attached without disengagement of 
its plastic sheath therefrom. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
blind rivet comprising a hollow rivet body including a shank 
and a flange on one end of the shank and a mandrel which is 
longer than the body and is inserted into the hollow hole of 
the body, the mandrel being inserted so that a diametrically 
enlarged head thereof is positioned on the shank end 
opposite to the flange, the shank of the rivet body being 
buckled to expand by strongly pulling the mandrel, the blind 
rivet being attached to an attachment member such as a panel 
by means of the buckled shank and the flange; characterised 
in that the rivet

1 A blind rivet (1) comprising a hollow rivet body (4) 
including a shank (2) and a flange (3) on one end of the 

shank and a mandrel (5) which is longer than the body and is 
inserted into the hollow hole of the body, the mandrel being 

inserted so that a diametrically enlarged head (7) thereof 
is positioned on the shank end opposite to the flange, the 

shank of the rivet body being buckled to expand by strongly 
pulling the mandrel, the blind rivet being attached to an 

attachment member such as a panel (19, 20) by means of the 
buckled shank and the flange; characterised in that the 

rivet body is covered with a plastic sheath (10), which is 
formed into a tube having a tubular portion (12) to cover 

the diametrically enlarged head (7) of the mandrel and the 
shank of the rivet body; the outer surface of the rivet body 

shank is formed with a circumferential groove (15); and the 
inner surface of the tubular sheath is formed with a raised 

portion (17) so that the raised portion (17) fits into the 
circumferential groove (15). 
2 A blind rivet according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the plastic sheath which is formed into the tube having 

the tubular portion (9) also has a flange (13) to come into 
surface-contact with the flange (3) of the rivet body. 
3 A blind rivet according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the tubular portion (12) of the 

tubular sheath is formed in a non-circular sectional shape 
such as an ellipse or a hexagon and the rivet body shank (2) 

having a substantially circular sectional shape is forcibly 
fitted in the tubular portion. 
4 A blind rivet according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the flange (13) of the tubular sheath is formed with an 

 
annular portion (21) which surrounds the periphery of the 

rivet body flange (3) fitted therein. 
5 A blind rivet according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the circumferential groove (15) on the 

surface of the rivet body shank (2) is formed on the side 
closer to the end with the diametrically enlarged head (7) 

so that when the shank is buckled, a shank portion (16) 
between the circumferential groove (15) and the 

diametrically enlarged head (7) side end can get inside the 
buckled portion of the shank. 
6 A plastic sheath to cover a rivet body of a blind rivet 
which comprises a hollow rivet body (4) having a shank (2) 

and a flange (3) on one end of the shank and a mandrel (5) 
which is longer than the body and is inserted into the 

hollow hole of the body; characterised in that the sheath is 
formed in a tube having a tubular portion (12) to cover the 

diametrically enlarged head of the mandrel and the shank of 
the rivet body, and the inner surface of the sheath is 

formed with a raised portion (17) to fit in a 
circumferential groove (15) of the rivet body shank (2). 
7 A plastic sheath according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the sheath which is formed in the tube having the 

tubular portion (12) also has a flange (13) to come in 
surface-contact with the flange (3) of the rivet body. 
8 A blind rivet according to any of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that the tubular sheath (10) is in a 

cap-like form an end of which is closed. 
9 A sheath according to either claim 6 or claim 7 
characterised in that the sheath (10) has one closed end 

formed in a cap configuration.
