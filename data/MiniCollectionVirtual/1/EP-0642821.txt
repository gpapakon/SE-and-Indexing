<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for deodorising a gas stream includes a reservoir 
(2) for a 3 to 8% by weight aqueous hydrogen peroxide 

solution, and a supply pipe (26) for supplying the 
solution to the first of a series of scrubbing towers (14). 

The solution passes through each tower (14) before being 
returned to the reservoir (2) counter-current to the gas 

stream flowing upwards through the towers (14). Ultra-violet 
lamps (40) irradiate the solution prior to entering 

each tower and the reservoir (2) to create reactive species 

in the solution to oxidise odorous chemicals in the gas 
stream absorbed in the solution. This method provides the 

removal of odours caused by a wide range of organic and 
non-organic chemicals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the removal of odours from 
a gas stream. It is known to remove pollutant chemicals from exhaust 
gases produced by manufacturing processes to prevent 
harmful pollution of the environment to which the gases are 
released. There is now an increasing requirement to remove 
obnoxious odours from such gases to reduce the impact on 
people exposed to the gases even if the products are not in 
themselves harmful. Such odours are often produced by 
manufacturing processes, e.g. food production, where the 
chemical nature of the odour is not easily identifiable and 
may involve a number of organic species. Existing, well-established volatile organic compound 
and odour abatement techniques have various drawbacks in 
their application to odour removal. If the odorous exhaust products are combustible they 
can be incinerated but this is generally an expensive 
option especially if the contaminants are only present in 
small amounts in a gas stream. Adsorption techniques, for example using an activated 
carbon bed through which the gases are passed, are also  
 
expensive and have a high maintenance cost associated with 
replenishment of the adsorptive material. They are not 
appropriate for use with moist or humid gases. Chemical scrubbing, for example using an aqueous 
solution of sodium hypochlorite, can be effective, 
particularly with smells associated with meat processing, 
but has associated with it problems of chlorine fumes and 
eventual disposal of the scrubbing chemical as well as the 
need for multiple columns. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
a method of removing odours from a gas stream comprises 
forming a reactive medium by irradiating an aqueous 
solution of hydrogen peroxide with ultra-violet radiation 
and passing it into a mixing chamber and contacting the gas 
stream with the reactive medium in the mixing chamber. According to a second aspect of the present invention, 
an apparatus for removing odours from a gas stream 
comprises: supply means for supplying an aqueous solution 
of hydrogen peroxide to a mixing chamber by way of a source 
of ultra-violet radiation by which the solution can be 
irradiated to form a reactive medium; gas stream supply 
means for supplying the gas stream to the mixing chamber so 
it can contact the reactive medium; and extraction means 
for extracting the reactive medium from the mixing chamber. The ultra-violet irradiation creates reactive species  
 
within the hydrogen peroxide solution. As the gas stream
