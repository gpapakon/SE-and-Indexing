<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel enzymes. More specifically, the invention 
provides novel xylanases obtainable from strains belonging to the genus 
Rhodothermus. The invention also relates to the use of the xylanases in the 
treatment of lignocellulosic pulp. Xylan, a major component of plant hemicellulose, is a polymer of D-xylose 
linked by beta-1,4-xylosidic bonds. Xylan can be degraded to xylose and 
xylo-oligomers by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan 
produces free sugars without the by-products formed with acid (e.g. furans). Major applications for xylanases are enzymatic breakdown of 
agricultural wastes for production of alcohol fuels, enzymatic treatment of animal 
feeds to release free pentose sugars, manufacturing of dissolving pulps yielding 
cellulose, and bio-bleaching of wood pulp [Detroym R.W. In: Organic Chemicals from 
Biomass, (CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1981) 19-41.; Paice, M.G., and L. Jurasek., 
J. Wood Chem. Technol. 4: 187-198.; Pommier, J.C., J.L. Fuentes, G. Goma., Tappi 
Journal (1989): 187-191.; Senior, D.J., et al., Biotechnol. Letters 10 (1988):907-912]. The pulp and paper industry is using xylanase compositions in the 
bleaching process to enhance the brightness of bleached pulps, to decrease the 
amount of chlorine used in the bleaching stages, and to increase the freeness of 
pulps in the recycled paper process [Eriksson, K. E. L., Wood Science and 
Technology 24 (1990); 79-101.; Paice, M. G., R. Bernier, and L. Jurasek, Biotechnol. 
and Bioeng. 32 (1988): 235-239.; Pommier, J. C., J. L. Fuentes, and G. Goma, Tappi 
Journal (1989): 187-191].  
 Kraft pulping, a process widely used in the pulp and paper industry, 
involves the alkaline sulfate cooking of pulp to remove 95% of the lignin. The 
remaining 5% of lignin gives the pulp a dark brown colour which has the tendency 
to darken in UV light or by oxidation. In order to obtain a white pulp for high quality 
paper, the brown colour is removed by a multi-stage bleaching process using 
chlorine and/or chlorine dioxide. Presently, there is much concern about the environmental impact of the 
chemicals generated from the bleaching process. Enzymes can aid in the removal 
of lignin from the pulp without any harmful side products. Reports show that lignin 
in wood is linked to xylan [Eriksson, O., et al., Wood Sci.Technol. 14 (1980); 267.; 
Takashi, N., and T. Koshijiima, Wood Sci.Technol. 22 (1988); 177-189]. By a limited 
hydrolysis of the xylan a greater release of lignin occurs during bleaching.
