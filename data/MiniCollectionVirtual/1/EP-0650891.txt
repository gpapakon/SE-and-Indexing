<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention consists in arranging, in parallel with each of the sensors (32) for the function which it is desired to validate in a predetermined flight condition, controllable forcing means (33, 35) able to apply to the input of the safety circuit (30, 31, AL) to which the sensor (32) is connected, and in replacement for the output signal sent by the latter, a simulation signal corresponding to the signal which would be sent out by this same sensor (32) in the said flight condition, and in using a position of the collective pitch control member (34) of the aircraft, lying between the full fine pitch position (PPP) and a take-off limit position (PLD), in order to activate the forcing means (33, 35) so as to produce the simulation signal during a test sequence. The invention applies particularly to helicopters.

A method for validation on the ground of the 
safety functions of the piloting system equipping an 

aerodyne,
 
characterized in that it consists, on the one hand, in 

arranging, in parallel to each of the sensors (32) of 
the function to be validated for at least one 

predetermined flight condition, controllable forcing 
means (33, 35) capable of applying, at input of a safety 

circuit (30, 31, AL) to which the sensor (32) is 
connected and in replacement of the output signal 

emitted by the latter, at least one simulation signal 
corresponding to the signal which would be emitted by 

this same sensor (32) in said flight condition, and, on 
the other hand, in using at least one angular position 

of a collective pitch control mechanism (34) of the 
aerodyne, included between the minimum lift position 

(PPP) and a maximum lift position (PLD), for activating 
said forcing means (33, 35) in order to produce said 

simulation signal during a series of tests to validate 
the integrity of the safety circuits (30, 31, AL). 
The method as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that said simulation signal is variable 

as a function of the angular position of said collective 
pitch control mechanism (34). 
The method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterized in that it comprises an in-flight check of 

the consistency of the data provided by said sensor (32) 
with the data provided by a second sensor (36), and the 

emitting of an alarm signal when this check reveals an 
inconsistency. 
The method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the safety function to be 

validated consists in the detection of the extension 
threshold of a thruster (24) associated with a 

recentering device for this thruster (26, 27, 28, 29), 
and wherein the threshold value and the period of time  

 
(Î”T) during which the thresh
old may be exceeded before 
bringing about a recentering of the thruster (24) vary 

as a function of the speed of the aerodyne,
 
characterized in that it consists in replacing, during 

the testing phase on the ground, the data provided by 
the speed sensor (32) with data generated from the 

angular position of the collective pitch control (34), 
and in checking the value of the thruster (24) extension 

threshold and the period of time preceding automatic 
recentering of the thruster (24), from the moment the 

extension threshold has been exceeded. 
The method as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the aerodyne piloting system 

comprises a digital computer (1) which transmits, for 
each of the piloting axes, an instruction signal to a 

subtracter (8) of a control loop of the automatic pilot, 
via a coupling device (6),
 
characterized in that it comprises a first limitation of 

the signal (13) transmitted by the computer (1) to the 
coupling device (6), a second limitation of the signal 

(14) transmitted by said coupling device (6) to said 
subtracter (8), a check on the consistency between the 

signal supplied by the coupling device (6) and the 
signal having undergone the second limitation, and the 

transmission of an alarm signal in the event of 
inconsistency between these two signals. 
A device for implementing the method as claimed 
in any one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that it comprises a means (35) for 

detecting the angular position of the collective pitch 
control mechanism (34), and a means (33) enabling 

application, at input of a safety circuit (30, 31, AL) 
to which a sensor (32) is connected and in replacement 

of the signal emitted by said sensor (32), of a 
simulation signal corresponding to a predetermined 

flight condition, when the control mechanism (34) is in  
 

an angular position included between the minimum lift 
position (PPP) and a maximum lift position (PLD). 
The device as claimed in claim 6,
 
characterized in that it comprises a means (35) enabling 

the simulation signal to be varied as a function of the 
angular position of the collective pitch control 

mechanism (34). 
The device as claimed in one of claims 6 and 7,
 
characterized in that said safety circuit consists of an 

automatic thruster (24) recentering circuit comprising 
a subtracter (28) of which one input receives a signal 

(Vo) representing the centered position of the thruster 
(24), whereas the other input is connected to a detector 

(29) which detects the real position of the thruster, 
the output of said subtracter (28) being connected to 

the control input of the thruster (24) via a power 
amplifier (27) and a switch (26) which is controlled by 

the safety circuit comprising, in series, a level 
detector (30) connected to the output of said detector 

(29), and a time-out (31), said circuit being designed 
so that the time-out (31) issues a recentering signal 

which trips the switch (26) when the signal supplied by 
the detector (29) exceeds the threshold of the level 

detector and remains above it for a period of time 
determined by the time-out (31), and in that the 

adjustment inputs of the level detector (30) and the 
time-out (31) are connected, either to a first speed 

sensor (32), or to an angular position detector (35) 
associated with the control stick (34) of the collective 

controls, by means of a switch (33) controlled by a test 
control mechanism (41). 
The device as claimed in claim 8,
 
characterized in that it comprises a second speed sensor 

(36) or a speed threshold trigger and a comparator (37) 
destined to permanently or periodically check the 

consistency of the signals respectively supplied by the  
 

first and second speed sensors (32) and (36), and to 
activate an alarm device in the event of inconsistency.
