<ABSTRACT>
A photosensitive drum has a transparent substrate, 
a transparent conductor layer formed on the transparent 

substrate and a photosensitive layer formed on the 
transparent conductor layer. This drum is suitable for 

an electro-photographic recording apparatus in which 
exposure is effected from the back, i.e. the inside, of 

the photosensitive drum to form an electrostatic latent 
image on the photosensitive member. According to the 

invention the transparent conductor layer, and 
preferably also the photosensitive layer, are applied 

in liquid form, for instance by immersion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an 
electrophotographic recording apparatus. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an 
apparatus for effecting electrophotographic recording by 
using an electrophotographic photosensitive member, 
including a transparent conductor layer formed on a 
transparent substrate and a photosensitive layer formed 
on the transparent conductor layer, and by effecting 
exposure from the back of the photosensitive member. Existing copying machines and high-speed, high-quality 
printers generally use an electrophotographic 
recording system. This system employs a so-called 
"Carlson process" which uses a photosensitive member as a 
recording medium and effects recording through seven 
steps of uniform charging, image exposure, development, 
transfer, fixation, charge elimination and cleaning. In 
the charging step, a positive or negative uniform charge 
is applied to a surface of a photosensitive member having 
photoelectric conductivity and in the subsequent exposure 
process, a laser beam, etc., is shone onto the surface so 
as to eliminate a surface charge at a specific portion, 
thereby forming an electrostatic latent image, 
corresponding to the image information, on the 
photosensitive member. Next, this latent image is 
electrostatically developed to form a visible image, 
using a toner, on the photosensitive member. Finally, 
this toner image is electrostatically transferred to 
recording paper, and is fused by heat, light, pressure, 
etc., to obtain a printed matter. In the conventional  
 
recording apparatuses using this Carlson process, 
however, the means used for each process step are 
disposed around the photosensitive member. Therefore, 
when the size of the apparatus is reduced, these means 
are disposed close to one another around the 
photosensitive member. Accordingly, there is a limit to 
the reduction of the size of the recording system, and a 
problem that the developer scatters from the developing 
machine, contaminates the optical system used for image 
exposure means, and exerts adverse influences on 
printing, occurs. In view of the problems described above, a 
proposal has been made to dispose an image exposure 
source inside the photosensitive member in the image 
exposure process, and to effect light irradiation from 
the back of the photosensitive member (e.g. Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 63-174072, 
etc.). When the image exposure source is disposed inside 
the photosensitive member, it becomes possible to reduce 
the
