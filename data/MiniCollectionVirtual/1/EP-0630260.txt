<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
polysaccharide-protein conjugates and vaccines. In
particular the present invention relates to
polysaccharide-protein conjugates that elicit serum IgG
and IgM antibodies to both poly
α(2↦8) NeuNAc and poly α(2↦9) NeuNAc.Neisseriaemeningitidis are a major cause of
systemic infections, especially meningitis, in humans.
Capsular polysaccharide (CP) vaccines are licensed for
meningococcal groups A,C,Y, and W135. Diseases caused by
group B meningococci continue to occur in endemic and
epidemic forms and remain an important health problem
(Gotschlich, E.C. (1984) in Bacterial Vaccines. Ed.
Germanier (Academic Press, NY) pp. 237-255; Peltola, H.
(1983) Bev. Infect. Dis. 5, 71-91; Poolman, J.T. et al.
(1986) Lancet, ii,555-557). Escherichiacoli (E.Coli)
K1 is a major cause of neonatal meningitis, upper urinary
tract infections and systemic infections in hospitalized
patients and in domesticated an laboratory animals
(Robbins, J.B. et al. (1974) N. Eng. J. Med. 290, 1216-1220;
Kaijser, B. et al. (1977) Lancet i, 663-664; Cross,
A.S. et al. (1984) J. Infect. Dis. 149, 184-193; Orskov,
I., & Orskov, F. (1985) J. Hyg. Camb. 95, 551-575).
Despite antibiotic treatment and supportive care,
meningitis caused by these two pathogens continues to
exert a high morbidity, including permanent CNS injury,
and mortality (Peltola, H. (1983) Rev. Infect. Dis. 5,
71-91; Schneerson, R. (1988) in Understanding Mental
Retardation, ed, Kavanagh, J.F. (Paul Brookes Publishing 
Co. Baltimore), pp. 237-249; Brandtzaeg, P. et al. (1989)
J. Infect, Dis. 159, 195-204; McCraken, G.H., Jr. et al.
(1974) Lancet, ii, 246-250).The CP of Group B meningococci and of E.coli K1 are
identical (poly α(2↦8) NeuNAc) and serve as essential
virulence factors and protective antigens for both
pathogens (Grados, O., & Ewing, W.H. (1970) J. Infect.
Dis. 122, 100-103; Kasper, D.L. et al. (1973) J. Immunol.
110, 262-268; Bhattacharjee, A.K. et al. (1975) J. Biol.
Chem. 250, 1926-1932; Robbins, J.B. et al. (1974) N. Eng.
J. Med. 290, 1216-1220). Poly α(2↦8) NeuNAc is also a
surface antigen of Moraxellanonliquefaciens and
Pasteurellahaemolytica, serotype A-2 (Bøvre, K. et al.
(1983) NIHP Annals. 6, 65-73; Devi, S.J.N. et al. (1991)
Infect. Immun. 59, 732-736; Adlam, C. et al. (1987) FEMS
Microbiol. Lett. 42, 23-25). The latter is the major
cause of outbreaks of pasteurellosis in young lambs which
suggests that poly α(2↦8) NeuNAc may serve as a virulence
factor for yet another bacterial species.Attempts to induce
