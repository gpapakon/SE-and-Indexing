<ABSTRACT>
Valve device mounted on keg containers particularly 
for the distribution of beer or other drinks, comprising 

a double valve with a blockable gas passage and a 
blockable liquid passage, having a safety system 

comprising a catch (70) which does not allow the ejection of 
said valve when the threading is completely unthreaded 

unless acting with the proper equipment beyond the 
normal working stroke. Said proper equipment allows the 

free end of a finger (78) integral with the valve to be 
engaged between a vertical wall (74) of the catch and a pair 

of fins (76) also present on said catch for the purpose of 
effecting the retraction of the catch toward the axis of 

the valve, making the disassembly of the entire device 
from the container possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a valve device in 
particular for a transportable container of the type 
adapted to store and deliver a liquid under pressure 
from a propellant gas. These types of containers provided with said 
devices are generally used for the distribution of 
drinks or liquids in general. Said devices are used 
particularly in beer containers with an open delivery, 
said beer containers being kegs with a tap. In the prior art, different valve devices on 
transportable containers of the above-mentioned type are 
known. For this function, each container is provided 
with a double valve which has both a gas passage and an 
outlet passage for the liquid from the container by 
means of the pressure of the gas itself. This valve is generally mounted on a stub which is 
mounted in an opening on the upper part of the 
container; and in some cases, this mounting is done 
simply with threaded connection means, involving the 
risk that the valve can cause considerable damage 
because it could easily come off before the pressure of 
the gas of the container has been completely released 
and can, thus, be ejected with a great force by this 
pressure immediately when the threading is loosened. In other cases, the valve is mounted in such a way 
that it cannot completely or partially be removed from  
 
the container until the pressure in same is released 
completely and, thus, the above-mentioned risk is 
fundamentally eliminated. A device of this type, in which the safety system 
is realized through a catch placed in an opening of the 
valve housing and is adapted to rier around the lower 
border of the opening, is known from WO 91/02694 which is considered 
the closest prior art and on which is based the pre-characterizing part 
of claim 1. The catch of the above patent is provided 
with a protrusion toward the inside of the valve on 
which a finger will act, which moves co-axially to the 
valve so that in the bottom position of the stroke, said 
catch, by rotating around the lower border of the 
opening, is retracted in the sectional shape of the 
valve in such a way that the valve itself can be 
dlsmounted. The inconveniences which this solution presents are 
several: the assembly of the valve is very complicated 
since the insertion of the catch into the opening does 
not allow the positioning of the finger without proper 
equipment; regarding maintenance of the valves, that 
represents a considerable rise in costs; lastly, since 
the retraction of the catch is effected by the finger 
which

Valve device particularly for transportable containers 
of the type adapted to store and deliver a liquid under 

pressure from a propellant gas, comprising a ring-shaped hub 
(80) secured in an upward opening in a container; a double 

valve (10) having both a blockable gas passage and a 
blockable liquid passage and essentially consisting of a 

valve housing (12), which can be detachably mounted on the 
hub (80) and a riser pipe part arranged co-axially to an 

upper reception area of the valve housing such that said 
riser pipe part can be displaced axially from an upper 

closed valve position to a lower open valve position against 
the pressure from a spring (20) which is supported by a 

sealing ring (46) and mounted in the valve housing (12) in 
which said riser pipe can be further displaced partially 

axially downwardly from the lower open position to a lower 
bottom position; a finger (78) protruding toward the outside 

integral with said riser pipe, said finger being realized 
with elastic material, such as a corrosion-resistant spring 

steel, with a free end part spaced from the top and from the 
axis from the riser pipe with said finger arranged such that 

its free end is forced outward toward the internal wall of 
a lower part of the wall of said valve housing (12); a catch 

(70) arranged in an opening in said lower part of said wall 
of said valve housing (12), said catch having a pair of 

protrusions (72) which are projected outside of the wall of 
the valve housing (12) through proper openings present on 

said valve housing wall, said catch further having a  
 

vertical wall (74) and a fin (76), said protrusions being 
extensions of said vertical wall (74) and folded at a right 

angle to it, characterized in that a further fin (76) is 
provided, both said fins (76) being essentially formed as 

extensions of said two protrusions (72), curved essentially 
at 90Â° with respect to them and fundamentally placed one 

facing each other on the internal side of said valve housing 
(12) at a distance of the lower end of the vertical wall 

(74), within the space between the face of said vertical 
wall (74) facing toward the axis of the valve device and 

said two fins (76) acting the free end of said finger (78), 
thus maintaining the catch depressed in a safety position 

with said protrusions (72) extended outwardly, said fins 
(76) being positioned so as to be used with the end of said 

finger (78) when the riser pipe part is beyond the normal 
working stroke, thereby allowing the retraction of said 

protrusions (72) and, thus, the disassembly of the device. 
Valve device according to claim 1 characterized in 
that the bottom part of said catch (70) leans against said 

ring (46) of said valve and, when said protrusions (72) are 
extracted, said vertical wall (74) leans on the internal 

part of said external housing (12). 
Valve device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that one single opening is provided for each protrusions 

(72), the internal part of said external housing (12) 
against which said vertical wall (74) leans when said 

protrusions (72) are extracted being between said 
protrusions (72).
