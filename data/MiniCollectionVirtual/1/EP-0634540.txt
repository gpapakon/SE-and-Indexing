<ABSTRACT>
The variable-mass frame for flat structures has a 
knot element (1) utilizing four arms (2) serially 

hinged one to another by interaction of respective 
crown wheels (22) exhibited by the arms (2) at one 

end (21), at which one end (21) the arms (2) are 
constrained one to another by a plate (3) 

exhibiting four pivots (31) defining four rotation 
axes (A1, A2, A3, A4) for the crown wheels (22); 

the surface mass of the knot element (1) being 
varied by nearing or distancing free ends (23) of 

the arms, which free ends (23) are opposite to 
said first ends (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a variable-mass frame for
flat structures utilizable in the realisation of
planar structures such as, for example,
plinths, panels for false ceilings, false walls
and the like.A special application of the invention relates to
the erection of stands such as those used in trade
fairs and pavilions, or show and exposition areas
of various types, where a variable-extension floor
or wall structure is required, variable according
to the space afforded to the stand.At present, for the erection of such structures
tube or other metal parts are used, which are
associated one to another such as to create
mechanically resistent frames able to support the
flat structures.The tubes or other metal parts have variable
length and diameter according to the dimensions
and type of structure to be erected, and are
generally associated one part to another at knot 
intersections, whereat they are secured by joints.
The joints are usually of the friction type,
utilizing clamps of various kinds to fasten the
tube or other part, and sometimes are joints
between L-shaped ends of first tubes or the like
inserted in corresponding complementary seats
afforded by second tubes or the like.The knots are in effect the basic elements of
grids which constitute the rigid support
connections of the flat structures.A fundamental requisite of such structures is that
they are easy or in any case fast to assemble,
provide a sturdy final erection, and are also easy
and fast to disassemble, since normally such
structures are utilized for short periods of time
and then reutilized on further occasions.
Furthermore, such structures must be easily
adaptable to whatever space is afforded to the
exhibitor by the fair organizers.Prior-art structures, using clamped joints or the
like, give rise to problematic erection
operations, since generally the clamps are
tightened on the tubes by means of bolts, which
take considerable time to apply.In frames utilizing the above-mentioned L-shaped 
ends, one drawback is that frequently the
mechanical stress they are subjected to is more
than they can bear.The aim of the present invention is thus to
obviate the above-described drawbacks by providing
a collapsible-mass frame for flat structures,
which utilizes as a knot element four hinged arms,
according to claim 1.Further characteristics and advantages of the
present invention will better emerge from the
detailed description that follows, of an
embodiment of the invention, illustrated in the
form of a non-limiting example in the

<CLAIMS>
A variable-mass frame for flat structures
utilizable in the realisation of flat

structures such as, for example, plinths, panels
for false ceilings, false walls and the like,

characterised in that it comprises one or more
knot elements (1), each of which comprises:


four arms (2),
each of which exhibits a portion of cylinder (21)

at one end, which portion of cylinder (21) has
an external cogged section

having an axis which is parallel to an axis (X) of the cylinder portion
(21);
means for constraining the ends of the arms comprising at least one
plate (3) with four parallel pivots (A1, A2, A3, A4) the axes of which are oriented perpendicularly to the plate,

each pivot coinciding with one respective axis (X) of said arms (2);
the four pivots
being situated at the four vertices of a square (Q)

having side lengths (L) equal to double the
radius (R22) of the cogged section of cylinder,

such that the arms (2) 
can be rotated about said pivot axes, the four cogged portions

reciprocally and serially enmeshed, allowing different orientations
of the arms to be achieved.
A variable-mass frame for flat structures as in
claim 1, characterised in that the means for

constraining the ends of the arms are constituted by two plates (3)
each provided with four holes (30) arranged at the

four vertices of the square (Q) and functioning as
seats for receiving said pivots (31); said plates

(3) being associable and parallel one to another
and being perpendicular to the rotation axes (A1,

A2, A3, A4) such as at least partially to enclose
the cogged sections of cylinder.
A variable-mass frame for flat structures as in
claim 1, characterised in that the means for

constraining the ends of the arms are constituted by two plates (3),
each of which is provided with four holes (30)

arranged at the vertices of the square (Q), which
holes (30) constitute seats for receiving the

pivots (31), and by a fifth hole (32), centrally
situated, arranged on a diagonal of the square (Q) 

at a distance from the four holes (30) which is
not less than the radius (T22) of an addendum

circle of the cogged sections of cylinder which fifth hole
(32) provides a seat for a fifth pivot (35); said

plates (3) being associable perpendicularly
arranged in relation to the rotation axes (A1, A2,

A3, A4) and being distanced one from another by a
lesser distance than a length of the fifth pivot

(35) such as at least partially to enclose the
cogged sections of cylinder, so that the fifth pivot (35)

projects from at least one of the fifth holes (32)
and perpendicularly from the plates (3) by

variable distances, such as to permit of varying a
distance of the knot element (1) from a rest

surface (S) of the knot element (1).
A variable-mass frame for flat structures as in
claim 1, characterised in that the cogged section

of cylinder is asymmetrical in
relation to a median longitudinal axis (Y) of the

arms (2) such as to permit of enmeshing the cogged
sections of cylinder in a minimum configuration whereat the

four arms (2) are parallel one to another.
A variable-mass frame for flat structures as in 
claim 1, characterised in that the arms (2)

exhibit internally of the cogged sections of cylinder a
plurality of portions (24) projecting towards the

axis (X) of the cylinder portion (21), such as to give
rise to a hub (K) in which the pivots (31) can be

inserted.
