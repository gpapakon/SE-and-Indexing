<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a screw element for the preparing (compounding) and/or processing of plastics or elastomers in a screw machine (extruder), having screw shanks which can be driven in the same direction and having at least one pair of intermeshing screw elements, each screw element exhibiting a screw flight whose envelope extends radially away from the respective shank with constant spacing and in the longitudinal direction runs linearly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the shank, a radially outer-lying section of the screw flight, close to the barrel, running parallel to the barrel inside wall with a small clearance with respect to the latter, to achieve gentle rearrangement of the layers without stress peaks along with intensive axial and transverse mixing in a defined volume, it is provided that the envelope (8) encloses a blade flight (16) which is narrower than it, in such a way that the blade comb (17) of the said blade flight extends from the one axial end (18) of the screw element (1) and from the one, first outer side (20), in the circumferential direction, of the section (9) of the envelope (8) close to the barrel over a part of this section (9) of the envelope (8) close to the barrel, seen in the circumferential direction of an angle  phi , and in the axial direction towards the second outer side (21), in the circumferential direction, of the section (9) of the envelope (8) close to the barrel.
