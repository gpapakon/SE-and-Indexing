<ABSTRACT>
The novelty concerns a device for securing a housing of a measurement detector containing electronic circuits and connectors. Such measurement detectors are secured by means of a screw-in component in the wall surrounding the measuring medium. Here they can adopt a position depending on the function, in which it is very difficult to fit the connecting lines to a control room remote from the point of measurement. The housing is therefore to be movable axially symmetrically to the screw-in component. The proposed solution is for the releasable connection between the housing and the screw-in component to take the form of a single, easily accessible screw passing through a clamping plate and projections engaging in a groove in the screw-in component. The position of the clamping plate can be altered by tightening and loosening the screw in such a way that a clamped joint is produced between the projections of the clamping plate and the groove of the screw-in component in which the electronics housing is secured in any axially symmetrical position in relation to the screw-in component.

A device for mounting a housing, particularly an 
electronics housing (4) of a level gauge, comprising a 

screw-in piece (3) by means of which the level gauge is 
mounted in the wall surrounding the medium to be 

measured, a sensor (2) responsive to the measurand, and a 
nonpermanent joint by which the electronics housing (4) 

is connected with the screw-in piece (3) and is axially 
fixed and held in position relative to the sensor (2), 

characterized in that the nonpermanent joint between the 
electronics housing (4) and the screw-in piece (3) is 

formed by a single screw (46) extending through a shim 
(47) and by projections (53, 54) of the shim (47) fitting 

into a groove (36) of the screw-in piece (3). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the shim (47) is pivotable about a pivot point (58) by 

tightening or loosening the screw (46). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the projections (53, 54) of the shim (47) are supported 

by an annular surface of the groove (35) of the screw-in 
piece (3) in such a way that a clamping connection is 

provided between the projections (52, 54) and the groove 
(36) which fixes the electronics housing (4) in any 

axially symmetrical position with respect to the sensor.  
 
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the clamping connection (36, 53, 54) is formed by 

screwing in the screw (46) or released by unscrewing the 
screw (46). 
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
the screw (46), extending through a tapped hole (52) of 

the holding plate (50) of the shim (47), is supported by 
the bottom (42) of the housing (4). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the journal (34) of the screw-in piece (3) extends 

through the sleeve (43) of the housing (4) and through 
the opening (48) of the shim (47). 
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the electronics housing (4) is axially symmetrically 

pivotable about the journal (34). 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the circuit (6) of the 

level gauge (1), which is enclosed by an insulating body 
(62), occupies a position in the interior (44) of the 

housing (4) by which a free space (45) is formed for 
loosening or tightening the screw (46). 
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the shim (47) is movable sideward parallel to the surface 

of the bottom (42) of the housing (4). 
A device as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that 
the insulating body (62) has a holder (64) formed thereon  

 
which is engaged by the dog (55) of the shim (47), with 

an elastic pad (56) being enclosed therebetween, so that 
during the axially symmetrical pivoting of the housing 

(4) the insulating body (62) is held in position and 
driven. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the joint between the electronics housing (4) and 

the screw-in piece (3) is dustproof and splashproof.
