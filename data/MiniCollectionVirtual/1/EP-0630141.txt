<ABSTRACT>
A personal communications system is described 
which includes components of software and hardware 

operating in conjunction with a personal computer. The 
user interface control software operates on a personal 

computer, preferably within the Microsoft Windows® 
environment. The software control system communicates 

with hardware components linked to the software through 
the personal computer serial communications port. The 

hardware components include telephone communication 
equipment, digital signal processors, and hardware to 

enable voice, fax and data communication with a remote 
site connected through a standard telephone line. The 

functions of the hardware components are controlled by 
control software operating within the hardware component 

and from the software components operating within the 
personal computer. The major functions of the system 

are a telephone function, a voice mail function, a fax 
manager function, a multi-media mail function, a show 

and tell function, a terminal function and an address 
book function. The telephone function allows the 

present system to operate, from the users perspective, 
as a conventional telephone using either hands-free, 

headset or handset operation. The telephone function is 
more sophisticated than a standard telephone in that the 

present system converts the voice into a digital signal 
which can be processed with echo cancellation, 

compressed, stored as digital data for later retrieval 
and transmitted as digital voice data concurrent with 

the transfer of digital information data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to communications 
systems and in particular to computer assisted digital 
communications including data, fax and digitized voice. A wide variety of communications alternatives 
are currently available to telecommunications users. 
For example, facsimile transmission of printed matter is 
available through what is commonly referred to as a 
stand-alone fax machine. Alternatively, fax-modem 
communication systems are currently available for 
personal computer users which combine the operation of a 
facsimile machine with the word processor of a computer 
to transmit documents held on computer disk. Modem 
communication over telephone lines in combination with a 
personal computer is also known in the art where file 
transfers can be accomplished from one computer to 
another. Also, simultaneous voice and modem data 
transmitted over the same telephone line has been 
accomplished in several ways. There is a need in the art, however, for a 
personal communications system which combines a wide 
variety of communication functions into an integrated 
hardware-software product such that the user can 
conveniently choose a mode of communication and have 
that communication automatically invoked from a menu 
driven selection system. The present disclosure describes a complex 
computer assisted communications system which contains 
multiple inventions. The subject of the present 
multiple inventions is a personal communications system 
which includes components of software and hardware  
 
operating in conjunction with a personal computer. The 
user interface control software operates on a personal 
computer, preferably within the Microsoft Windows® 
environment. The software control system communicates 
with hardware components linked to the software through 
the personal computer serial communications port. The 
hardware components include telephone communication 
equipment, digital signal processors, and hardware to 
enable both fax and data communication with a hardware 
components at a remote site connected through a standard 
telephone line. The functions of the hardware 
components are controlled by control software operating 
within the hardware component and from the software 
components operating within the personal computer. Communications between the software components 
running on the personal computer and the local hardware 
components over the serial communications link is by a 
special packet protocol for digital data communications.
