<ABSTRACT>
The tank comprises a device for the activation of the flushing that causes the raising of plugging body (1) by means of a kinematic chain that provides for the rotation of hook (5) hinged to one end (6') of a balance wheel driven by activation button (9). At the end of the maximum travel of button (9) itself, this hook (5), after it has raised plugging body (1)  by lever (2), thus initiating the flushing phase, is shifted by balance wheel (6) against protruding support (4') of tank (4), forcing it to release plugging body (1) and thus effect the closing of outflow hole (23) after the lever of the water has decreased to the pre-determined extent. The modalities of the sequence of operation of the flushing which is automatic, are independent of whether button (9) is kept pressed down or is immediately released after it has been pressed. With two different buttons, the differentiated flushing with two different quantities of waters is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of hygienic 
sanitary installations, and more particularly, that of 
flushing tanks with differentiated drainage to be built into 
the wall. As is known, one of the major problems to be solved 
in this field is that of making possible the maximum saving 
of the quantity of water used in each phase of flushing, 
while at the same time guaranteeing the perfect cleanliness 
of the bowl of the sanitary installation to which the flush 
tank is combined. For this purpose, the need has been 
pointed out for differentiating the duration of the discharge 
phase of the flush water depending on whether it is a matter 
of flushing liquid materials or else solid materials, since 
it has been found that, while in the latter a quantity of 
water equal to about 8-10 liters is necessary, in the former 
case 4-6 is already sufficient for complete flushing. Prior art already offers on the subject various 
solutions to obtain the above mentioned differentiated 
discharge: since, in almost all tanks, the plugging of the 
hole for the discharge of the water is achieved through 
gravity by a plug body immersed in the water contained in 
the tank, the above mentioned result was obtained by making 
the above mentioned plug body into two coaxial members, 
and by making it possible, by acting on two different 
activation buttons, to either sustain or not sustain the 
weight of one of them through the activation device of the 
discharge. It is clear that, by varying the overall weight of 
the plug body, the duration of the flushing phase of the 
discharge water will vary; the less the weight is, the more 
water will have to flow out of the tank to cause the force of 
gravity to again push the plug against the outflow hole, 
since it is no longer sufficiently counteracted by the 
buoyancy corresponding to the volume occupied by the immersed 
part of the plug body.  
 Various solutions, conceptually analogous to what 
has been presented thus far, have been described previously: 
some examples are patent applications GB-A-2,077,790, EPA-0,448,042, 
DE-A-2601282. All these examples, in order to obtain the 
differentiated discharge effect described above, resort to 
the possibility of disengaging or not disengaging hooks that 
support one of the members of the plugging body. Thus, in 
the present application, 
it is not deemed necessary to describe this technical 
solution, already well known. All the examples above, however, still present one 
drawback: that of less than absolute certainty as to the

<CLAIMS>
Flush tank to be built in for toilets, equipped 
with a device for the activation of the discharge of the 

flushing water acting on a plug body (1) immersed in the 
water and plugging the outflow hole (23), in which the initiation 

of the flushing phase is obtained by the essentially vertical 
raising of the plug body (1), then the discharge itself is 

interrupted by the subsequent lowering of the plug body (1) 
caused by the force of gravity when it is not counteracted by 

sufficient buoyancy acting on the plug body itself, and 
this buoyancy is reduced to a certain extent as a consequence 

of a corresponding decrease in the level of the water 
contained in the tank, characterized in that said raising of 

plug body (1) is obtained by means of the rotation of 
a lever (2) hinged on pivot (3) that is in one piece with a fixed 

structure (4) and with said body (1) connected to an end (2') 
exhibiting protruding part (2") against which a hook (5) 

catches, which undergoes a push upward by the effect of the 
rotation of a balance arm (6) at the end (6') of which it is 

connected so as to be free to rotate, while the balance arm 
is also pivoted, essentially at the center, on said 

pivot (3), and connected to the other end (6") in such a way 
that it can rotate with respect to it, to a member (7) 

protruding from the body of an activation rod (8) that moves as 
one piece with a button (9) for the activation of the flush, 

and all the parts are shaped and sized so that, by the effect 
of a preset displacement of activation rod (8), the rotation of 

balance arm (6) is such as to effect the shift of the hook (5) 
to cause it to be supported against a support (4') protruding 

from said fixed structure (4), so that, by the effect of the 
next pass of the rod (8) in order to reach its maximum displacement, 

the hook (5) rotates around its end (5') connected to the balance 
arm (6), so that it disengages from the protruding part (2") of 

the said lever (2), thus ceasing to exert any 
raising action on the plug body (1), which from that moment 

is acted upon only by the force of gravity and the buoyancy 
relative to its portio
n immersed in water. 
Flush tank according to claim 1, wherein two 
different activation buttons are present, and by operating on  

 
them respectively, it is possible to obtain two different 

durations for the flushing phase, depending on the total 
force bearing on plug body (1), and this body is composed 

of at least two coaxial members (1', 1") that are free to 
slide in relation to one another, of which one (1"), when the 

greater duration of the flushing phase is desired, is 
disengaged by the action of the activation device, in that it 

does not add its own weight to that of the other member (1'), 
with which it no longer forms one piece, thus obtaining a 

greater duration of the period of buoyancy of the plugging 
body. 
Flush tank according to claim 2, wherein at 
least one (1") of said two coaxial members (1', 1") is in 

turn comprised of two parts (10, 11) free to be able to slide 
in relation to one another, and fixed in the relative desired 

position by fastening screw (13) or another equivalent 
member. 
Flush according to claim 3, wherein the 
inner coaxial part (1') of plugging body (1) has, in the 

sliding area in relation to the more exterior part (1"), an 
essentially rectangular cross-section and slides within hole 

(20) made in the external coaxial part (1") that has the 
same shape but which exhibits grooves (21) on all four of its 

sides, for reducing the contact surface in the 
sliding between the two parts and increasing the relative 

contact pressure.
