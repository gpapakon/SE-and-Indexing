<ABSTRACT>
A communications system comprises items of equipment connected via a bus 
capable of transferring combinations of control signals and AV signals as packets 

while providing an environment which is the same as an environment where 
connections are made using analog signal lines. A register decided by an address 

is taken to be a virtual plug for each item of equipment. A plug enable for an 
input plug is set to 1 and a synchronous communication packet for the AV signal 

from the channel set by the channel number is received. A plug enable for an 
output plug is set to one and the synchronous communication packet for the 

information signal is sent to the channel set by the channel number at a 
transmission speed designated by the DR (Data Rate) at the bandwidth expressed 

by "Bandwidth".

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communications systems.In communication systems where audio visual (AV) equipment such as, for
example, Video Tape Recorders (hereinafter referred to as VTRs), Televisions
(hereinafter referred to as TVs) etc. are connected together via analog AV signal lines
and digital control signal lines, a DDB (Domestic Digital Bus) has been used.
Examples of this kind of system are described in our European Patent Applications
Publication Nos. EP-A-0 604 166, EP-A-0 610 630, EP-A-0 604 167 and
EP-A-0 608 624, and in corresponding US patent applications.First, a description will be given of an example of this kind of communications
system with reference to 
FIG. 17. This kind of communications system is equipped
with a TV, a VTR 1, a VTR 2, a Multi Disc Player
(hereinafter referred to as an MDP), and an editor. The
VTR 2 is also connected to a device which is not
compatible with a digital control signal line (hereinafter
referred to as a non-bus compatible device).The AV signal input/output plug for the non-bus
compatible device is connected to input/output plugs of
other devices only by plugs described by P1, P2 and P3,
protruding directly out from units known as switchboxes
(SW box) via analog AV signal lines. Commands such as
connection control commands etc. are sent and received
by other devices via analog AV signal lines and digital
control signal lines which are connected separately. Each
item of equipment is also equipped with one or more
functional units, which in the case of a VTR would be a
deck for recording and playing back and a tuner for
selecting the signal to be received, and in the case of a
TV, would be a monitor and an amplifier. There is also an
AVC (AV controller) for controlling the operation of all
of the items of equipment, although this is not shown in
the diagrams. In the following, these functional units may
also be referred to as sub-devices.Control connection can be carried out in two ways in
a communications system structured in this way. These 
ways, which will be referred to as connection control
method 1 and connection control method 2, will be
described in numerical order.In connection control method 1, information
pertaining to the connection structure for each device,
i.e. which plug is connected to which plug of an opposing
item of equipment and whether plugs are used for input
or output, is pre-stored by the user. In this way, an
output plug which it is considered will make a connection
from the sub-device which is to be the AV signal source
to the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An information signal handling device comprising:

a digital interface operable to input and to output packets containing control
signals, the control signal packets having a destination address field, and packets

containing information signals, the information signal packets having a channel number
field defining a communications channel selected from a plurality of channels; and
memory means for storing one or more virtual plugs which are used to
discriminate between the channels for input and output of information signal packets,

the virtual plugs being set up by that information signal handling device or by a control
signal packet received from another information signal handling device;

   in which information signal packet transfers between information signal
handling devices when connected together, via the channels, are arranged in dependence

upon connections designated by the virtual plugs and the channel numbers defined by
the information signal packets.
A device according to claim 1, in which the virtual plugs are set up separately
for inputting and for outputting signals.
A device according to claim 1, each information signal handling device
comprising a plurality of sub-devices for inputting and outputting information signals

within the device, in which connections between the sub-devices and the virtual plugs
are independent with respect to connections between the virtual plugs.
A device according to claim 1, in which each of the virtual plugs comprises plug
enable information and an information signal channel number written-in to a

predetermined address in the memory means and in which the input and output of an
information signal via the information signal channel number is carried out by

controlling the plug enable information.
A device according to claim 3, in which the virtual plug comprises overwrite
protection means operable to protect information written therein. 
A device according to claim 1, in which the information signal is an audio
signal, an video signal or a signal comprising both audio and video.
A communications system comprising a plurality of interconnected information
signal handling device according to any one of the preceding claims.
