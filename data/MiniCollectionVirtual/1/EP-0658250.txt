<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sealing bolt means for sealing the lid (A) of a container to the body (B) of a container. The sealing bolt means comprises a head (1) and a body (4) which interlocks the lid and the body of the container, wherein the internal structure (1a) of the head (1) is at least partially deformed when an attempt is made to remove the sealing bolt means from the container onto which the bolt has been secured and tightened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ultrasonic
sealing bolts and identification bolts for use in
sealing containers holding dangerous substances or
sensitive or valuable materials, for example, fissile
materials.Within the framework of Nuclear Safeguards,
there is a demand for a robust and durable system of
seals making possible the monitoring, identification
and verification, over a period of several years, of
containers used for the conveyance and then storage
under water of fissile materials to be reprocessed.There is also a demand for an identification
system, for example, for nuclear transportation
casks, or for other movable structures of strategic
value (containers, underframes, guns, etc.) which
have to be supervised or indexed. This system will
have to use, as "markers", elements which can
withstand the severe operating conditions of the
structure on which they are mounted.The idea of using a random distribution of
defects in a stable structure for recognition by
ultrasonic means is already known and is derived
directly from non-destructive testing techniques. At
the beginning of the 1980s, the applicants studied
various solutions and, in particular, prototype seals
for fuel elements. The initial solutions encountered
problems in respect of the reproducibility of the
identity reading and were not provided with integrity
control. These systems are such that it is not
possible to identify a "broken" seal. A solution is 
used in Canada for steady stacks of irradiated fuel
elements, based on another method of generating an
ultrasonically measurable random signature. However,
this kind of seal cannot be identified once it has
been broken.Further prior art is described in
GB-A-2,067,699 which discloses a tamper-proof system
primarily intended to seal commodity meters. A bolt
has a two part head held together by a breakzone such
that when the bolt is fastened to a given torque, the
breakzone fractures and the head is free to move in a
plastic cup. If the bolt is to be unfastened, the
head must be disengaged from the cup and this can
only be achieved by damaging the cup visibly, thus
indicating tampering.US-A-4,294,122 describes a bolt and an
apparatus for mounting the bolt. The purpose of the
combination of bolt and mounting apparatus is to
fasten the bolt precisely at a predetermined load. A
transducer is mounted in the bolt for obtaining
preload measurements.EP-A-4,455,506 discloses a system similar to
that described in US-A-4,294,122. The purpose of the
apparatus is to mount a bolt and test its

A sealing bolt means for sealing the lid (A)
of a container to the body (B) of a container, the

sealing bolt means comprising a head (1) and a body
(4) which interlocks the lid and body of the

container, the internal structure of the head being
constructed such that it is at least partially

deformed when an attempt is made to remove the sealing
bolt means from the container onto which the bolt has

been secured and tightened wherein the internal
structure of the head (1) comprises a plurality of

randomly arranged stacked discs (1b), each disc having
one or more voids therein so that when the stack has

been brazed a specific identity is provided for each
sealing bolt means.
A sealing bolt means as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein the body (4) has a threaded shank which can be

threaded into the container.
A sealing bolt means as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein the body (4) is hollow and comprises clamping

elements to secure the sealing bolt means to a pre-installed
dowel or pin which interlocks the lid and

body of the container.
A sealing bolt means as claimed in any
preceding claim, wherein the internal structure of the

head (1) comprises a pattern of cavities which can be
sensed ultrasonically.
A sealing bolt means as claimed in any
preceding claim, further comprising a frangible

element (1a) within the internal structure of the head 
(1) which breaks in a predetermined position when an

attempt is made to remove the sealing bolt means from
the container.
A sealing bolt means as claimed in Claim 5,
wherein the frangible element (1a) has a region of

reduced thickness thereby providing a weak point in
the element.
A sealing bolt means as claimed in Claim 6,
wherein the frangible element (1a) is formed b on a

delay line block (1c), the stacked discs (1b) and
delay line block (1c) being brazed together to produce

a core.
A sealing bolt means as claimed in any
preceding claim, wherein the head (1) is adapted to

co-operate with a reading device (23) which can
generate an ultrasonic signal and compare the

ultrasonic signal reflected by the internal structure
of an untampered sealing bolt means with that

reflected by a tampered sealing bolt means or a
sealing bolt means which becomes loosened after having

not been tightened adequately.
Use of the sealing bolt means according to any preceding claim in combination with a reading device comprising a transducer
(24) which can generate an ultrasonic signal and sense

the signal reflected by the internal structure of the
sealing bolt means.
Use of the sealing bolt means as defined in Claim 1 in a method of testing for tampering of the
sealing bolt means comprising

the steps of applying a reading means (23) to the head
(1) of the sealing bolt means, generating an

ultrasonic signal and sensing the signal reflected 
from the internal structure of the sealing
 bolt means,
and comparing the reflected signal with the signal

reflected from an untampered sealing bolt means to
determine whether tampering has occurred or whether

the sealing bolt means has been untightened or
removed.
A method of testing as claimed in Claim 10,
wherein both the specific identity and the integrity

of the internal structure are read simultaneously.
Use of the sealing bolt means as defined in claim 1 in combination with a reading device comprising a reading head
(20, 23), means for fitting the reading device (23) to

the sealing bolt means, a
transducer (24) and ultrasonic signal generating

means, which device determines the identity and/or
integrity of the internal structure of the sealing

bolt means, wherein the transducer
rotates in close vicinity to the sealing bolt means

thereby recording the ultrasonic signal reflected from
the internal structure of the sealing bolt means.
