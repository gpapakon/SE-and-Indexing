<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of low 
density, porous, crosslinked, polymeric materials by a high 
internal phase water-in-oil emulsion polymerization 
process. Polymeric foams can be classified as either 
closed-cell foams or as open-cell foams. Open-cell foams 
can be used as a matrix to contain various liquids and 
gases. They are capable of various industrial 
applications, for example as wipes and diapers, as carriers 
and ion exchange resins. For some of these applications, 
it is desirable to have porous crosslinked polymer blocks 
which have a very low density and a high capacity of 
absorbing and retaining liquids. Such high absorption 
capacity, low density, porous polymer blocks can be 
prepared by polymerizing a specific type of water-in-oil 
emulsion known as high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) 
having relatively small amounts of a continuous oil phase 
and relatively greater amounts of an internal or disperse 
water phase. Further, other properties such as thin dry 
thickness (i.e. thickness of the polymer product after 
removal of water) and low compressive strain (i.e. 
resistance to compression deflection) are also desirable 
for use as an absorbent. Typically, these high absorption capacity, low 
density foams are prepared by forming a high internal phase 
water-in-oil emulsion (typical water to oil weight ratio of 
above 9:1) in the presence of a surfactant and polymerizing 
the monomers in the oil phase of the emulsion with a 
polymerization initiator at a temperature of around 60°C 
for about 8 hours. However, it has been found that at a 
higher water to oil ratio, for example above 30:1, the 
stability of the emulsion is poor, sometimes causing the 
emulsion to break.  
 The present invention seeks to prepare low 
density, porous, crosslinked, polymeric foams with improved 
absorption capacities and foam properties utilising a 
water-in-oil high internal phase emulsion with improved 
stability at a high water to oil ratio. According to the invention there is provided a 
process for the preparation of a porous crosslinked 
polymeric material comprising the steps of: 
(a) providing a water-in-oil emulsion comprising 
(i) a mixture of polymerizable monomers comprising at least 
one vinyl monomer and from 2 to 50 weight percent, based on 
the mixture, of a difunctional unsaturated crosslinking 
monomer, (ii) at least 90 weight percent, based on the 
emulsion, of water as the internal phase (iii) from 2 to 40 
weight percent, based on the polymerizable monomers, of a 
surfact
