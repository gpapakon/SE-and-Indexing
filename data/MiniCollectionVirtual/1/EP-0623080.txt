<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydraulic reservoir and 
master cylinder assembly in particular for 
hydraulic systems on automobiles. It is known from GB-A-1539879 to provide a 
hydraulic clutch control system comprising a master 
cylinder, a reservoir, and a slave cylinder which 
are assembled together with conduit, and then the 
entire system is filled with hydraulic fluid prior 
to installation on a vehicle. The present invention relates to a master cylinder 
and reservoir assembly which is particularly 
suitable for use in a pre-filled hydraulic clutch 
control system. The present invention provides a compact, cheap 
master cylinder/reservoir assembly. Accordingly there is provided a hydraulic master 
cylinder and reservoir assembly having a master 
cylinder body with a fluid reservoir, and a master 
cylinder bore with a piston assembly sealingly  
 
reciprocal within the bore, the assembly being 
characterised in that the fluid reservoir having at 
least a portion thereof concentric with the master 
cylinder bore and being sealed from atmosphere by a 
rolling diaphragm, the inner periphery of the 
diaphragm being sealed to the piston assembly, and 
the outer periphery of the diaphragm being 
sealingly slidable relative to an internal surface 
of the reservoir allowing the volume of fluid 
within the reservoir to expand or contract. It is an advantage of this construction that no 
sliding piston seal is in direct contact with the 
atmosphere. The primary seal directly separates the pressure 
chamber from the reservoir chamber and the classic 
secondary seal is replaced by the deformable 
diaphragm which is substantially stationary during 
piston reciprocation and is airtight. The master cylinder body may include a cylindrical 
liner spaced from the internal wall of the body 
forming a chamber therebetween, said chamber 
constituting a part of the reservoir.  
 The metal liner may have a mouth at one end and an 
end wall at the other end, the liner being capable 
of limited axial movement in the body, and the end 
wall of the liner forming a recuperation valve 
controlling the flow of hydraulic fluid between the 
master cylinder bore and the reservoir. It is an advantage for the liner to be both rigid, 
of metal or other material, and of a material of 
low elasticity, and in this latter case, for the 
liner to be provided with a calculated functional 
play, and supported by the body after a slight 
expansion due to the effect of the pressure. The master cylinder may have an outlet port which 
receives a
