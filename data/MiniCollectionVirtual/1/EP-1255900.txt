<ABSTRACT>
A support device for adjustably supporting structural members of a conservatory roof, has an alloy hub (1) formed with outwardly opening channels (9), oriented vertically in use, each channel retaining a radially extending arm member (11) capable of pivotal movement in the vertical and horizontal planes. The arms (11), each of which in use supports the upper end of a glazing rafter, can be positioned along the axes of channels (9) to provide height adjustment for the roof assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Improvements in or Relating to ConservatoriesThis invention relates to conservatories and more particularly to a support device or 'hub1 for the construction of a conservatory roof.A gable-end conservatory roof section, for example, may be supported from the end of a ridge bar, which supports a glazed roof on one or both sides. In the case of a double pitched conservatory roof the gable-end roof section, covering the bay or "bell end" of the conservatory may have various different forms.In the 'Edwardian' or 'Georgian' style of conservatory the roof hip bars diverge at about 90 degrees or more, any additional jack rafters extending between the eaves and the hips. A corresponding number of windows are generally formed in the end wall of the conservatory to provide a flat end elevation.In the 'Victorian' style one or more rafters are provided intermediate the hips (which in this case usually diverge at more than 90 degrees) so that the roof section may be formed with a plurality of inclined lights, the end wall of the conservatory being formed with corresponding windows to provide a faceted end elevation.It is important that the alignment of the roofing panels of a bay roof are properly aligned with the adjacent pitched roof sections the necessary adjustment being facilitated by this invention.Conservatories may be constructed as lean-to structures and various roof forms may be required to accommodate the associated features of an existing building. For example, where a conservatory is to extend around an external corner of a building a hip or, possibly, a more complex segmented roof structure may be provided to carry the roof around an external corner. 

In the case where two roof ridges meet at the internal corner of a building, a valley member, extending from junction of the ridges to the eaves is required to support the adjacent edges of the two roof sections.Where a double-pitched bay intersects with a lean-to roof it will be necessary to provide a valley on each side of the bay roof each extending from the ridge to the eaves.At any such point at the ridge of a conservatory roof where a hip, valley or bay-roof rafter assembly is required the number, inclination, azimuth and height of the rafter, hip or valley member as the case may be, should be capable of adequate and easy adjustments during the construction stage to facilitate the assembly process .GB Patent No. 2214964 describes one form of device for supporting a segmented roof over the bell end of a conservatory, the device having a ring member

Claims
1. A support device foi adjustably supporting structural members of a conservatory roof, comprising: - a hub, the hub being formad with at least one outwardly opening channel, oriented vertically in use, each channel retaining a radially extending arm member adapted for pivotal movement in the vertical plane, means being provided to retain the arm at a desired location along the channel.
2. A device as claimed in claim 1 in which the channels are substantially circular in cross section, the or each arm having a spigot for longitudinal sliding engagement in each such channels.
3. A device as claimed in claim 2 in which the spigot is adapted for rotation about the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical channel.
4. A device as claimed in Claims 1-3 in which a plurality of outwardly opening channels are disposed and arranged around the surface of the hub so that the arms may project through the mouths of the channels more or less radially outwardly from the hub.
5. A device as claimed in Claim 4 in which the mouth of each channel is of such width as to permit the arm radiating therefrom to swivel from side to side so that the included angle between adjacent arms may be adjusted.
6. A device as claimed in claim 5 in which the arm and channel are so disposed and arranged so that the arm may swivel about 7 or 8 degrees on either side of the normally radial line.
7. A device as claimed in any preceding claim in which the arm may be adapted for pivotal movement in a vertical plane by providing an articulated joint between an first arm part and a second arm part, 


the latter being securable to the end portion of a structural component such as a rafter, hip or the like.
7 A device as claimed in Claims 1-6 in which a rigid arm is connected to a spigot in the form of a ball joint located in the channel to permit pivotal movement of the arm m both altitude and in azimuth.
8. A device as claimed m any preceding claim in which the bore of each channel is provided with adjustment means for adjusting the height of the arm.
9. A device as claimed in claim 8 in which the adjustment means is in the form of the leading end of an adjustment screw located coaxially in the lower portion of bore. Locking
10. A device as claimed in Claims 8-9 in which means may be provided to lock the spigot and the associated arm in the required vertical position along the axis of the channel.
11. A device as claimed in claim 10 in which the locking means comprises a grub screw located coaxially in the upper portion of the bore in opposition to the adjustment screw, the spigot being clamped between the opposed coaxial screws.
