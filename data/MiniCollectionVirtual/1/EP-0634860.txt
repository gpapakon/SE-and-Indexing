<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus are set forth for coordinating 
and controlling the execution of predefined Voice Mail 

system specific and/or protocol mandated processes in 
response to predefined signals which indicate the status of 

an Audio Messaging Interface Specification (AMIS) Analog 
Message Delivery Session. 
According to one aspect of the invention, each 
predefined status signal uniquely corresponds to a 

predetermined event that may take place during a Session, 
and each such status signal is logically associated with a 

set of responses. In particular, one aspect of the 
invention contemplates a method (and corresponding 

apparatus) for coordinating and controlling the operation 
of a voice messaging system network that supports the AMIS 

Analog protocol in response to Message Delivery Session 
status signals, comprising the steps of: (a) defining a set 

of exchange status signals each of which uniquely 
corresponds to a predetermined event that may take place 

during an AMIS Analog Message Delivery Session; 
(b) associating each exchange status signal with a set of 

process control signals for driving a set of predefined 
processes; (c) translating a given exchange status signal 

into its associated set of process control signals; and 
(d) driving the processes in the set of predefined 

processes utilizing the set of process control signals. 
The invention may be used in commercially 
available voice messaging system networks that support the 

AMIS Analog protocol, such as the RolmTM PhoneMailTM VM 
system network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to voice messaging
("VM") system networks that support the Audio Messaging
Interface Specification (AMIS) Analog Protocol. Such
networks enable VM systems manufactured by different
vendors to communicate in an open network (sometimes
referred to herein as an "open access") environment.More particularly, the invention relates to methods
and apparatus for coordinating and controlling the
execution of predefined VM system specific and/or protocol
mandated processes in response to predefined signals which
indicate the status of an AMIS Analog "Message Delivery
Session". Each such session, as defined herein, is a
single connection between voice message systems during
which one or more messages, with accompanying protocol
information, may be transmitted from an originator to an
intended recipient.An example of an event reported in the form of a
status signal (sometimes referred to herein as an
"exchange" status signal) that is processed by an
originating system is a "destination busy" signal occurring
during call set up; an example of an event reported in the
form of status signal that is processed by both an
originating and destination system is a "successful message
delivery" signal; an example of an event reported in the 
form of status signal that is processed by a destination
system is a signal indicating that the "originating system
has hung up", etc. Again, as indicated hereinabove, each
such event has a predefined status signal associated
therewith in VM system networks in which the invention may
be practiced.The invention may be used in commercially available
voice messaging system networks that support the AMIS
Analog protocol, such as the RolmTM PhoneMailTM VM system
network. The invention is described herein, for the sake
of illustration only, in the context of the PhoneMail VM
system network."Address" - A means by which the system and mailbox of
a message originator and recipient are identified using the
AMIS Analog Protocol. The form of the input from the
originator identifying the intended recipient is locally
defined. However, the address used in identifying the
originator must have two parts: a System Number and a
Mailbox ID."AMIS" - Audio Message Interchange Specification - A
specification of the interaction between two systems for
the purposes of exchanging voice messages. Unless
otherwise indicated, it is used herein to reference the
AMIS Analog Protocol described in the publication entitled
"Audio Messaging Interchange Specification (AMIS)- Analog
Protocol",
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for coordinating and controlling a first voice messaging system network
in a internetwork of voice messaging networks during a internetworked voice messaging

session carried out under a defined common internetwork protocol, the common protocol
permitting the networks to establish a communications link with each other for executing at least

one process selected from a plurality of processes to be implemented through an exchange of
coded signals, and wherein the method includes a step of identitying (701), by the first network,

the occurrence of a event defined by the common internetwork protocol during the voice
messaging session, and a step of generating (702) a status signal to signify the occurrence of the

event, the method CHARACTERISED BY the steps of:

(a) the first network logically associating (703) the status signal with a set of
process control signals for implementing a set of processes selected from a plurality of processes;

and
(b) the first network translating (603) a given status signal into its associated
set of process control signals.
The method as set forth in claim 1 wherein the step of logically associating further
comprises the substeps of:


(i) storing the set of process control signals as an entry in a data structure; and
(ii) using the status signal as a key into the data structure to retrieve the set
of process control signals.
The method as set forth in claim 2 wherein the data structure is a table and the key
is an index into the table.
The method as set forth in claim 1 further including the steps of

(c) the first network providing the process control signals to at least one
appropriate system in the first network; and
(d) the at least one appropriate system executing (704) the selected set of
processes whenever the process control signals are received.
The method of claim 1, wherein the status signal is a dual tone multi-frequency
signal.
The method of claim 1, wherein the defined protocol comprises an analog
protocol.
The method of claim 1, wherein the event comprises the transmission of a message
from the first messaging network to a second messaging network.
The method of claim 1, wherein the processes from which the selected set of
processes is selected comprise providing a information prompt and recording message delivery

statistics.
The method of claim 1, wherein the process control signals include a signal
specifying a prompt indicating that a call could not be completed, and a signal indicating that a

destination is busy.
The method of claim 1, wherein said set of processes attempts to redeliver a
message in accordance with the protocol.
The method of claim 1, wherein said set of process control signals includes a retry
message delivery signal for driving said set of processes.
The method of claim 1, wherein said set of predefined processes includes a process

The method of claim 1, wherein said set of process control signals includes a
prompt specification signal for driving said process for playing a prerecorded prompt.
The method of claim 1, wherein said set of predefined processes includes a process
