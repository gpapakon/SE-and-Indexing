<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides methods for improving the baking properties of cake flour using microwave heating. The microwave treated cake flour is intended as a substitute for chlorinated cake flour. The present unchlorinated, microwave treated cake flour is an essential ingredient in dry mixes for batter baked goods especially high sugar-to-flour ratio layer cakes. In addition to other dry mix ingredients, preferred dry mixes additionally essentially comprise about 0.15 % to 0.45 % triglycerol monostearate for even greater enhancement of finished baked goods' volume. The method comprises exposing undehydrated cake flour having a moisture content of 12 % +- 2 % to sufficient amounts of microwave energy to heat the flour to a temperature of about 230  to 270  F and to a finished moisture content of less than 6 %. Preferred microwave flours are additionally characterized by a peak pasting viscosity of at least 400 Stir Number Units.
