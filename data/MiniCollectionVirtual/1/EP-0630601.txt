<ABSTRACT>
A vertical display counter (3) is disclosed 
which has a refrigerated compartment provided with an 

access opening protected by a cold air barrier and 
removable closure means (15); the counter is also 

equipped with ventilating means (20,32,41) to promote a 
non-turbulent circulation of ambient air between the 

barrier and the closure means (15), while the latter 
are in use, thereby preventing turbulence phenomena 

from disturbing the cold air barrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigerated 
display counter of the type which comprises a counter 
body to enclose a refrigerated compartment having at 
least one vertically extending access opening protected 
by a barrier of cold air, said opening being provided 
with removable closure means for temporarily isolating 
said compartment from the ambience outside the counter 
body. Display counters with the above features have 
been known and widely used at stores and supermarkets. 
They are generally fitted with shelves or racks on 
which perishable food products, adapted for 
preservation in a refrigerated environment, are 
displayed for sale. The removable closure means of the opening 
that gives access to the refrigerated compartment 
generally are used overnight, or while the store is 
closed, in order to reduce the thermal exchange between 
the refrigerated compartment and the ambience. Such 
means consist as a rule of single- or multiple-sheet 
curtains, each sheet being provided with a respective 
take-up device located at the counter body top. Due to constraints on the design and 
construction of the counter, the sheets of such 
curtains are not guided or otherwise held tight against 
the counter body along the two opposed vertical sides 
thereof. Thus, a gap has been accepted, in the 
stretched condition of the curtain, either between two 
adjacent sheets or between the edge of one sheet and 
the adjoining counter body shoulder, through which 
ambient air can enter the refrigerated compartment.  On contacting the refrigerated produce, and 
especially the shelves, which are held at a low 
temperature by the refrigerated air, the warmer and 
moisture-laden outside air releases it moisture content 
in the form of condensate. It is on this account that 
the produce on display and the shelves are found wet 
upon removal of the covering curtain. The underlying problem of this invention is 
to provide technical arrangements in a refrigerated 
display counter whereby the drawbacks with which the 
aforesaid prior art is beset can be obviated. This problem is solved, according to the 
invention, by a display counter of the kind indicated 
in the introduction and characterized in that it 
comprises ventilating means associated with either or 
both of said counter body and said closure means to 
promote a non-turbulent circulation of ambient air 
between said cold air barrier and said closure means. In practice, the approach of this invention 
is based on the observation that, since the gaps 
between curtain

<CLAIMS>
A refrigerated display counter comprising 
a counter body (2) to enclose a refrigerated 

compartment (3) having at least one vertically 
extending access opening protected by a barrier of cold 

air, said opening being provided with removable closure 
means (15) for temporarily isolating said compartment 

(3) from the ambience outside the counter body, 

characterized in that it comprises ventilating means 
(20,32,41) associated with either or both of said 

counter body (2) and said closure means (15) to promote 
a non-turbulent circulation of ambient air between said 

cold air barrier and said closure means (15). 
A display counter according to Claim 1, 
wherein the ventilating means comprise at least one 

port (20) in said closure means (15) located near a top 
portion (2c) of said counter body. 
A display counter according to either 
Claim 1 or 2, wherein said closure means comprise a 

curtain (15) adapted to be stretched over said access 
opening. 
A display counter according to Claim 3, 
wherein said ventilating means comprise a plurality of 

throughgoing ports (20) clustered in the top portion of 
said curtain (15). 
A display counter according to Claim 3, 
wherein said ventilating means comprise regions (32) of 

said curtain (31) having different properties of 
perviousness to air. 
A display counter according to one or more 
of the preceding claims, wherein said ventilating means 

comprise at least one port (41) located in a top wall 
(2c) of said counter body. 
A display counter according to Claim 6, 
 

wherein said at least one port (41) is open to said 
refrigerated compartment (3) at a location near 

lighting means (42) therefor to form an exhaust stack 
for dissipating the heat generated by the lighting 

means (42) from said compartment (3).
