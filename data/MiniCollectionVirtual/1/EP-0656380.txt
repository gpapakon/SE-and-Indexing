<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process of molding a
polyurea based composition, a polyurea based RIM
composition, and molded articles obtained thereby by RIM
and spray molding.Polyurethane polymers prepared from an active
hydrogen-containing compound and an isocyanate are widely
employed in molding processes, particularly reaction
injection molding (hereinafter RIM) processes. RIM
articles are finding increased usage as automotive fascia.The basic polyurethane polymer systems are typically
based on an OH polyol component, an OH cross-linker and an
isocyanate component. However this system suffers from
long cream, demolding and cycle times, greatly increasing
the processing time. Modifications to the basic
polyurethane system to shorten these processing times has
been achieved through substitution of the OH cross-linker
with an aminic cross-linking system. Typically,
thermosetting urethane polymer compositions comprise an 
isocyanate component with an excess of isocyanate groups
and an aromatic diamine as a chain extender, to form a
polyurea-type urethane polymer. Optionally, the polymer
composition may also contain additional amounts of a
reactive polyol to form a hybrid urea-urethane polymer.
Such systems greatly decrease the cream and demolding
times, therefore enabling much shorter cycling times in a
RIM process.The use of chain extenders, such as di-alkyl aromatic
diamines, and more particularly di-ethyltoluene diamines
and di(alkylthio)aromatic diamines are often used with
isocyanate pre-polymers alone or with a polyol component to
form a polyurea/polyurethane molding RIM composition (for
example U.S. 4,595,742, 4,631,298, and 4,786,656). While
an increase in the flexural modulus is observed through the
addition of di-alkyl(thio)aromatic diamines, these
compositions are still limited with respect to flexural
modulus without observing "cold break" on demolding. "Cold
Break" is a brittleness observed in the molded article
during demolding. The presence of cold break causes the
molded article to fracture on demolding. When trying to
achieve a higher flexural modulus, to above 80,000 psi, by
increasing the isocyanate content of the isocyanate
component (i.e. higher % NCO), these materials suffer "cold
break". Alternatively attempts to increase the flexural
modulus by increasing the functionality of the polyol 
component also suffers from "cold break". Accordingly,
efforts to increase the flexural modulus while preventing
"cold break" is an on going area of research.In addition to the mechanical properties
