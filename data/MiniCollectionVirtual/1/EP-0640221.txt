<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
polysiloxane water absorbing materials which can be 
used for biomedical devices, such as contact lenses 
and intraocular lenses. These hydrogels can be 
fashioned into contact lenses that are water absorbing, 
soft, hydrophilic, flexible, hydrolytically stable and 
biologically inert. The hydrogels are prepared from 
the polymerization of an acrylic-capped polysiloxane 
prepolymer with a bulky polysiloxanylalkyl 
(meth)acrylate monomer and at least one hydrophilic 
monomer. Hydrogels have long been a desirable class of 
material for the preparation of biomedical devices. 
See, for example, Wichterle, et al U.S. Patent No. 
3,220,960 which discloses hydrogels comprising a 
hydrated polymer of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or 
methacrylate crosslinked with a corresponding diester 
(poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, known as poly-HEMA). Hydrogels are crosslinked polymeric systems that 
can absorb and retain water. The physical properties 
of hydrogels can vary widely and are mostly determined 
by their water content. Since hydrogels exhibit 
excellent biocompatibility, there has been extensive 
interest in the use of hydrogels for biomedical 
devices, especially contact lenses.  
 In the field of contact lenses, various factors 
must combine to yield a material that has appropriate 
characteristics. Oxygen permeability, wettability, 
material strength and stability are but a few of the 
factors which must be carefully balanced to achieve a 
useable contact lens. Since the cornea receives its 
oxygen supply exclusively from contact with the 
atmosphere, good oxygen permeability is a critical 
characteristic for any contact lens material. 
Wettability also is important in that, if the lens is 
not sufficiently wettable, it does not remain 
lubricated and therefore cannot be worn comfortably in 
the eye. The optimum contact lens would therefore, 
have both excellent oxygen permeability, and excellent 
tear fluid wettability. Polymeric materials that can be polymerized to 
form a water-free xerogel are known. Xerogels are 
understood to be (unhydrated) polymers which swell in 
the presence of water and retain their water content 
(i.e., they can be hydrated to form hydrogels). It is 
also known, with respect to hydrogel materials 
traditionally used to make contact lenses, that as 
water content of the crosslinked hydrogel polymers 
increases, so does the oxygen permeability through the 
lens to the eye and its cornea. However, as the water 
content of hydrogel contact lenses
