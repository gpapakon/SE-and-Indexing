<ABSTRACT>
A floating breakwater having improved wave impact 
stability which comprises a first floating barrier and a 

second floating barrier which lie longitudinally and are 
kept mutually spaced and joined by a framework provided with 

transverse elements. The particularity of the invention, in 
addition to the fact that it has the above described 

geometrical configuration, is also that each one of the 
floating barriers is provided by means of floating bodies 

that form an upper floating volume and a lower ballasting 
mass.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a floating breakwater
having improved wave impact stability.It is known that floating breakwaters or seawalls are
already available which in practice are constituted by a
barrier that is submerged to a limited depth and has much
longer oscillation periods than the force-applying actions,
so that the kinetic energy of the waves is dissipated.In conventional floating breakwaters it has been
observed that the floating barrier can, in case of a more
prolonged wave motion, tend to follow the rise of the wave,
consequently being less effective in dissipating the kinetic
energy of the waves.Another drawback that can be ascribed to the solutions
proposed by the prior art is also constituted by fact that
conventional breakwaters have a single function and do not
allow to use them as a floating wharf or as a walkway.The aim of the invention is indeed to solve the
drawbacks described above by providing a floating breakwater
having improved wave impact stability that allows to reduce
the rise of the breakwater in the presence of waves without
however modifying its general buoyancy characteristics.Within the scope of this aim, a particular object of
the invention is to provide a breakwater that can have four
functions, namely floating breakwater, walkway, sheltered
landing for watercraft, and occasional unsheltered landing
in case of dead calm.Another object of the present invention is to provide a
breakwater that is capable of giving the greatest assurances
of reliability and safety in use by virtue of its particular 
constructive characteristics.U.S. Patent 3,991,576 discloses a floating breakwater
comprising floating bodies which lie longitudinally and are
kept mutually spaced and joined by a framework provided with
transverse elements. The floating bodies are formed by a
housing containing a floating material and a weighting
material.The aims and objects of the present invention mentioned
above and others which will become apparent hereinafter are
achieved by a floating breakwater having improved wave
impact stability comprising a first floating barrier and a
second floating barrier which lie longitudinally and are
kept mutually spaced and joined by a framework provided with
transverse elements, said floating barriers comprising
floating bodies that form an upper floating volume and a
lower ballasting mass, characterized in that each floating
body comprises an upper caisson and a lower caisson which
are inserted into one another and respectively form said
upper floating volume
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Floating breakwater having improved wave impact
stability comprising a first floating barrier (1) and a

second floating barrier (2) which lie longitudinally and are
kept mutually spaced and joined by a framework (3) provided

with transverse elements, said floating barriers comprising
floating bodies (10) that form an upper floating volume and

a lower ballasting mass, characterized in that each floating
body comprises an upper caisson (11) and a lower caisson

(12) which are inserted into one another and respectively
form said upper floating volume and the region for

containing said lower ballasting mass.
Floating breakwater according to Claim 1, further
comprising masses of single-cell foamed plastics in said

upper caisson (11).
Floating breakwater according to Claim 1 or 2,
wherein a chamber is formed between said upper caisson (11)

and said lower caisson (12), said chamber being connected to
the outside by means of a hole (16) formed on the wall of

said lower caisson (12), and in that the water that forms
said lower ballasting mass can be introduced in said

chamber.
Floating breakwater according to one or more of the
preceding claims, wherein said upper caisson (11) and said

lower caisson (12) are mutually joined by locking bolts (20)
in the coupling region.
Floating breakwater according to one or more of the
preceding claims, further comprising, at the upper edge of

said upper caisson (11), profiled elements (30) for 
retaining a covering (31) that forms a walkable surface.
Floating breakwater according to one or more of the

preceding claims, further comprising, on the sheltered side
and on the unsheltered side, fenders for the mooring of

watercraft.
