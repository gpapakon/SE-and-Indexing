<ABSTRACT>
A P-F connector establishing electrical connection between a conducting layer 
formed on the inside wall of the funnel and a fluorescent layer formed on 

the inside wall of the panel is disclosed. 
The P-F connector comprises a fixed portion (20A) having a through hole 
(20D); the first connecting portion (20B) extended from one side of said 

fixed portion (20A) and bent, to be electrically connected to said conducting 
layer; and the second connecting portion (20C) extended from the same side 

of said fixed portion and bent in the opposite direction from said first 
connecting (20B) portion to be electrically connected to said fluorescent 

layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a P-F connector for electrically 
connecting a conductive layer formed on the inside of a 
funnel and a fluorescent layer formed on the inside wall of a 
panel. Generally, a cathode-ray tube consists of a neck having an 
electron gun mount assembly and a body having a viewing 
screen. The body has a panel and a funnel. A conductive layer 
is formed on the inside wall of the funnel and a fluorescent 
layer is formed on the inside wall of the panel. The funnel 
has an anode terminal a high voltage is applied to. The 
fluorescent layer inside the panel should be electrically 
connected to the conductive layer inside the funnel. The P-F connector is mounted on a mask frame so that the 
fluorescent layer of the panel is electrically connected to 
the conductive layer of the funnel. A frame holder is welded 
to the mask frame, and on one end of the frame holder is 
mounted a holder pin. The conductive layer on the lower 
portion of the holder pin is manually coated by a paint-brush 
so that the fluorescent layer of the panel can be connected 
to the frame holder. Hence, a high voltage applied to the 
anode terminal is transmitted to the fluorescent layer of the 
panel by means of the conductive layer of the funnel, the P-F 
connector, the mask frame, the frame holder and the 
conductive layer on the lower portion of the holder pin. By the prior manner of applying the high voltage of the anode 
terminal to the fluorescent layer of the panel the  
 
conductivity of the fluorescent layer is reduced, thereby 
deteriorating the quality of the viewing screen. Also, 
because the conductive layer on the lower portion of the 
holder pin is manually coated by a paint-brush, the process 
of manufacturing a cathode-ray tube is complicated. Another known type of P-F connector (US-A-3796903) has a 
three-element structure comprising a pair of leaf springs as 
connecting elements, which are secured by welding or brazing 
to opposite faces of a metal piece. An object of the present invention is to provide a P-F 
connector of the above-mentioned type which while assuring 
high electric performance can be manufactured and assembled 
in an easy manner with little costs. Another object of the 
invention is to provide a P-F connector for a cathode-ray 
tube in which the fluorescent layer of the panel is directly 
connected to the conductive layer of the funnel. Still 
another object of the invention is to simplify the 
fabrication process of a cathode-ray tube by omitting a 
coating process of a
