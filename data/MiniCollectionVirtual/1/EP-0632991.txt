<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sponge-headed mop including a fixture (1) connected to a handle (2), this fixture comprising at least one elongate support element (3) intended to receive a spongy layer (4). According to the invention, the spongy layer (4) is fixed to the support (3) by removable fixing means consisting of at least two fixing tabs (5) integral with the support (3) and of at least one fastening plate (7) integral with the spongy layer (4) and intended to interact with the fixing tabs (5). These tabs are mounted so that they can slide in means (8) forming a slideway. Furthermore, the sponge-headed mop according to the invention includes two lateral wings mounted so they can pivot and are able to be operated between a mopping position and a wringing position through the use of operating means (14 to 30). A connection apparatus (31 to 37) may be provided for fitting the handle (2) to the fixture (1). The handle may be mounted so that it is orientable, and a scraper (44) may be provided on the front face of the fixture (1).
