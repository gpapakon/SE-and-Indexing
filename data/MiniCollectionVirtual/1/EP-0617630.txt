<ABSTRACT>
A shut-off valve member (1) is capable of shutting off the valve in response to an egressive air thrust. It is proposed to provide the valve with a blow-off valve member (2) of a design such that said valve can open in response to an overpressure in the trachea which exceeds a given value. This blow-off valve member limits the maximum achievable overpressure behind the valve. Coughing is possible without prior operation of the valve and leakage due to excessive overpressure in the trachea is prevented. The valve may contain a tissue connector and a housing to be connected thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tracheostoma valve with a 
shut-off valve member capable of shutting off the valve in 
response to an air displacement and with a blow-off valve member 
according to the preamble of claim 1. In patients with disorders involving the closure or at 
any rate a reduction of the connection between the trachea and 
the pharynx, it is known to have the trachea terminate at the 
throat via a stoma (opening in the skin). Such a connection of the trachea to the environment is 
for instance fitted in patients who have been treated for an 
extensive malignant tumor in the larynx by removing the larynx 
(including vocal chords and epiglottis) and in whom the trachea 
has been closed at the former larynx. In order to maintain at least some possibility of 
speaking, new vocal chords are formed in the pharynx from 
muscular tissue, mucous membrane or connective tissue. WO-A-86/06970 
discloses a valve which is fitted in the wall between 
the trachea and the esophargus, capable of allowing air to pass 
to the esophagus in the case of overpressure in the trachea. For 
realizing an overpressure in the trachea, a tracheostoma valve of 
the type described in the opening paragraph hereof is used. The 
patient can close this valve by expelling breath relatively 
quickly. Subsequently, due to overpressure in the trachea, an 
airstream is realized through the further valve and along the 
substitute vocal chords for setting those vocal chords into 
vibration.  
 A tracheostoma valve as described above is, for 
instance, commercially available under the designation of "ESKA-Herrmann 
valve" and is marketed by the firm of ESKA of LÃ¼beck, 
FRG. A drawback of such valves is that they also shut off 
the trachea in the case of fast egressive airstreams due to 
coughing. In order to avoid this, the valve member should be 
removed from the valve before coughing or the shut-off valve 
member should be adjusted to a coughing position. A further drawback which presents itself in the use of 
such known valves is the frequent occurrence of leakage between 
the valve and the stoma, causing interfering noise during speech 
which, moreover, further impairs the patient's audibility, which 
is impaired as it is. GB-A-2 164 424 discloses a self-retaining voice 
prosthesis device which comprises duct means defining an air 
passageway and a rigid flap valve pivotally mounted therein. The 
flap valve is designed to be into an open position during normal 
inhalation and exhalation but to be moved into its closed 
position
