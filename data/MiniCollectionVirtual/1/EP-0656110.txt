<ABSTRACT>
A device for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring a sample to be analyzed in vitro or in vivo by means of attenuated total reflectance has at least one radiation source, an ATR element and a detector unit. The invention is characterised by the combination of the following characteristics: the radiation source generates a primary beam directed towards the ATR element and which hits the ATR element at an angle (alpha) which is larger than the limit angle of the total reflectance (alpha)T at the interface between the optically denser and the optically thinner medium; the sample to be analysed can be placed on at least one side of the ATR element and its surface-near layer interacts with the primary radiation; a detector unit which corresponds to the incidence angle of the primary radiation on the ATR element detects the radiation leaving the ATR element.
