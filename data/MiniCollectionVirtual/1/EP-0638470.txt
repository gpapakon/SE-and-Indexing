<ABSTRACT>
An electric power steering apparatus having first and 
second control means for performing a control relating 

to a steering assistance. The second control means includes 
means for determining the occurrence of abnormality 

in said first control means (21) if control information 
on said driving current value indicates a 

value that does not drop below a predetermined value 
when the detected steering torque is inside the dead 

zone, means for determining the occurrence of abnormality 
in said first control means (21) if control information 

on the motor driving direction indicates a 
steering assisting direction opposite to the direction 

of the detected steering torque when the detected 
steering torque is outside the dead zone, and means for 

determining the occurrence of abnormality in said first 
control means (21) if the driving current value is 

greater than a predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric power 
steering apparatus for assisting the force required to 
turn the steering wheel of a vehicle. US-A-4,869,334 describes an electric power steering 
apparatus which uses a vehicle speed sensor to measure 
the travelling speed of the vehicle and a torque sensor 
to measure the steering torque applied at the steering 
wheel. In the electric power steering apparatus of this 
type, when the steering torque measured exceeds a predetermined 
dead zone, a steering assisting motor is 
driven by a driving current of the magnitude determined 
according to the measured steering torque and the measured 
vehicle speed, and the rotational force of the 
motor is used to provide power to assist the force required 
to steer the vehicle, thereby providing a comfortable 
steering feel to the driver. The steering assistance 
is controlled by a controller (hereinafter 
called the CPU). One such electric power steering apparatus 
employs a dual CPU configuration to assure the 
system safety against malfunctions, such as runaway, of 
the CPU.  
 The electric power steering apparatus with a dual CPU 
configuration has a main CPU for controlling the steering 
assisting force and a sub CPU for detecting failure 
of the main CPU by monitoring the inputs and outputs 
to and from the main CPU so that, upon detection of 
failure of the main CPU, the sub CPU initiates a fail-safe 
control, involving the stopping of the motor and 
so on, to secure the system safety. In the dual CPU system, it is necessary to separately 
monitor the basic operation of each individual CPU. To 
achieve this, each of the main and sub CPUs is connected 
to a separate watchdog monitoring circuit which measures 
the frequency of watchdog pulses generated at a 
fixed repetition rate from the CPU connected to it and 
compares the measured frequency with a reference value 
to detect failure in the CPU operation. When any abnormality 
in the main or sub CPU operation is detected by 
the associated watchdog monitoring circuit, the fail-safe 
control is performed. However, the above electric power steering apparatus 
having separate watchdog monitoring circuits for the 
main and sub CPUs has the problem of increasing the 
production cost because of the provision of the two 
watchdog monitoring circuits in the form of hardware in 
addition to the main and sub CPUs.  
 It is the object of the invention to provide an electric 
power steering apparatus having low production 
costs. This problem is solved, according to
