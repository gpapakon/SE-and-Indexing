System for controlling the power supply of an
asynchronous motor powered by an AC network through a

speed variator (10) comprising a rectifier bridge (11)
connected to the network, an intermediate DC circuit

(12) equipped with a capacitor (16) and an inverse
rectifier (13) equipped with switches and connected to

the motor phase windings; the system comprising means
of restoring control of the motor speed after the motor

supply has been switched off, characterized in that the
means of restoring control comprise an identification

structure (28) that estimates the electrical speed ω
of the motor starting from a measurement of the angular

position of the voltage vector developed by the motor,
and sets the angular position of the voltage vector to

be applied to the motor at the time of restored control
to make it correspond to the voltage vector developed

by the motor, in a rotating orthogonal coordinate
system (d, q) in which the (d) axis corresponds to the

motor flux and the (q) axis is  π / 2 ahead of the (d)
axis.
System according to claim 1, characterized in
that the identification structure (28) comprises a

structure for estimating the speed ω using an angle
calculation block (33) that determines the angular

position of the voltage vector by calculating its angle
α with respect to an orthogonal coordinate system (α,β)

fixed with respect to the motor stator, and a
differentiation block (34) that differentiates the

angle α.
System according to claim 2, characterized in
that the angle calculation block (33) determines the

angle α by calculating  Vβ / Vα  where Vα and Vβ are the 
coordinates of the voltage vector V in the (α,β)

coordinate system, and using a table of values that
defines a function ATN = ( Vβ / Vα ).
System according to any one of the previous
claims, characterized in that the identification

structure (28) comprises a positioning block (35) that
positions the voltage vector in the (d, q) coordinate

system such that the voltage vector is carried by the
(q) axis, by initializing the (d) axis at an angle 

with respect to the (α) axis such that  = α -  π / 2, or 
= α +  π / 2 depending on the sign of the motor speed.
System according to any one of the claims,
characterized in that the restored control means

comprise a device (36) for gradually increasing the
voltage component V
q
 in the (d, q) coordinate system up
to a control value using a time constant that depends

on the rotor time constant.
System according to claim 5, characterized in
that it comprises a structure (24) with cascade

regulations and that this structure can limit the
current when the variation of the component V
q
 of the
voltage towards the motor control value is faster than

the rotor time constant.
