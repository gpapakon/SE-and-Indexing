<ABSTRACT>
A method and circuit arrangement for tracking data signals 
between a '0' and a '1' level uses a data slicing comparator having 

a pair of switched data level tracking ciruits for tracking the '0' 
and '1' levels respectively and combining the output from the 

circuits to give a single data level output for slicing incoming 
data signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a Data Tracking System and 
includes a method and a circuit for tracking data signals to 
achieve maximum data separation irrespective of signal level. The 
invention finds particular but not exclusive application to data 
systems where a desired stream of information has to be separated 
from a multi-level received signal. A typical type of separation 
is that of receiving a teletexed signal and separating the 
teletexed information from other information in a multi-feature 
broadcast system. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved method and circuit for tracking data signals. According to the first aspect of the present invention a 
method of tracking data signals, comprises feeding an input signal 
to a data slicing comparator and a pair of data level tracking 
circuits, one of the said data level tracking circuits tracking a 
"One" level of the data signal and the other tracking circuit 
tracking the "Zero" level, obtaining an output from each of the 
said data level tracking circuits and combining the outputs to give 
a single data level output which can be used to slice the incoming 
data signals. The method may include feeding the input signal to a 
plurality of data level tracking circuits connected in parallel. 
Preferably there are a pair of such circuits but there may be more,  
 
such as four, depending on the requirements of the system in which 
the method is used. The output from the data level tracking circuits are each 
fed to separate data slicer the output of which is then fed to a 
common output. Where the system includes a plurality of data level 
tracking circuits these may each include its own driver circuit and 
the driver circuits can each be enabled serially under the control 
of a data slicing comparator which compares the input signal to a 
voltage mid-way between the stored voltages. According to the second aspect of the present invention a 
data tracking circuit arrangement comprises a pair of signal level 
tracking circuits, each signal level tracking circuit including 
switching means which are switched to allow tracking of the 
incoming signal only during such times as the sliced data output 
from the circuit signals the appropriate data such as '0' and '1' 
events. Thus in a 2-level system, the '1' level tracking circuit 
only tracks the incoming signal when the sliced output data is a 
'1' and '0' level is tracked only when the data is a '0'. The 
tracking circuit may use a number of means for controlling tracking 
perfo

passed to the other in order to preserve the 'data-height' between 

the tracking circuits whilst allowing for each circuit to track to 
the correct level.
