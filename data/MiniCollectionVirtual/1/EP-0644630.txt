<ABSTRACT>
The attachable commutator is produced by overmoulding on electrically conducting elements, and comprises a first cylindrical part (10a, 10b, 20, 22) with slip rings (10a, 10b), a second part (34, 14a, 14b) with connection elements for a winding, and an intermediate part (12a, 12b, 32a, 32b) linking the first and second parts, this intermediate part comprising two arms having a conducting linking part (12a, 12b) embedded in the insulation (32a, 32b). According to the invention, the second part of the commutator comprises a moulded ring (34) made of insulating material and having a diameter substantially greater than that of the cylindrical part, and the arms each comprise a first section (321a, 321b) extending in the prolongation of the said cylindrical part and a second section (322a, 322b) flaring out radially as far as the said ring.

<CLAIMS>
A slip ring unit for attachment to an alternator, 
especially for a motor vehicle, the alternator having a 

shaft with a portion of small diameter and a portion of 
larger diameter, the slip ring unit being made by 

moulding an insulating material on electrically 
conductive elements, and comprising a generally 

cylindrical first portion (10a, 10b, 20, 22) having two 
slip rings (10a, 10b) at its outer surface, a second 

portion (34, 14a, 14b) having two connecting elements 
for connection with the wire ends (FB) of a winding, 

and an intermediate portion (12a, 12b, 32a, 32b), for 
linking the first and second portions together 

electrically and mechanically and comprising two 
branches, each of which includes a conductive portion 

(12a, 12b) for providing a link between a slip ring and 
a connecting element embedded in the insulating 

material (32a, 32b), characterised in that the second 
portion of the slip ring unit comprises a ring (34) of 

insulating material made integrally by moulding and 
having a diameter which is substantially greater than 

that of the said cylindrical portion, whereby to 
position it on the said portion of larger diameter of 

the shaft, and in that each of the said branches has a 
first portion (321a, 321b) extending the said  

 
cylindrical portion, together with a second portion 

(322a, 322b) which radially expands up to the said ring. 
A slip ring unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the said connecting elements 

(14a, 14b) extend radially outwardly as extensions of 
the said branches. 
A slip ring unit according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the said
 ring (34) has means 
(341, 342) adapted to be gripped by a robotic machine. 
A slip ring unit according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the said means include two 

diametrically opposed concave surfaces (342). 
A slip ring unit according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the said concave surfaces (342) 

are formed in integral thickened portions (341) of the 
ring, offset by 90Â° with respect to the connecting 

elements (14a, 14b). 
A slip ring unit according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that lateral lugs (1241), anchored in 

integral thickened portions (343) of the ring, are 
arranged at the transition between the connecting 

elements (14a, 14b) and the linking portions (12a, 
12b).  

 
A slip ring unit according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that a hole is provided at the 

transition between the connecting elements (14a, 14b) 
and the respective linking portions (12a, 12b), for 

positioning the latter before the moulding operation. 
A slip ring unit according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that each branch (32a, 32b) includes 

on an outer face a shoulder (323a, 323b) defining an 
abutment for a bearing (R) of the alternator shaft. 
A slip ring unit according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that each conductive linking portion 

(12a, 12b) has, at least locally, a generally U-shaped 
cross section. 
A slip ring unit according to one of Claims 1 to 
9, characterised in that the said generally cylindrical 

first portion (10a, 10b, 20, 22) has a central bore 
(24) in which two diametrically opposed splines (26, 

26') are formed by moulding, and in that internal and 
lateral surfaces of the said branches (32a, 32b) 

constitute extensions of internal and lateral surfaces 
of the said splines. 
A slip ring unit according to one of Claims 1 to 
10, characterised in that the said second portions 

(322a, 322b) of the branches have a profile in the 
general form of a quarter-circle.  

 
An alternator (A), especially for a motor vehicle, 
characterised in that it includes a slip ring unit (1) 

according to one of the preceding Claims, fitted on a 
projecting shaft (AR).
