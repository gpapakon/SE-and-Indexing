<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle comprising front and 
rear steering mechanisms and a steering control system having a 
first mode in which both steering mechanisms operate and a second 
mode in which only one of the steering mechanisms operates. The 
invention is applicable primarily, but not exclusively, to 
wheeled vehicles, e.g. telescopic material handlers, fork 
lifters, off-road vehicles, etc. A vehicle is known having steerable front wheels and 
optionally steerable rear wheels. The driver turns the steering 
wheel in the cab to align the rear wheels in the straight-ahead 
position before changing from four-wheel steering (compound 
steering) to two-wheel (front-wheel) steering (simple steering). 
This is a difficult operation, particularly if the rear wheels 
are not visible from the driver's normal position in the cab. The present invention relates to an arrangement such that, 
when switching means is operated to switch the steering control 
system from the first mode to the second mode, the change to the 
second mode is prevented unless and until the other steering 
mechanism (which does not operate in the second mode) is in its 
straight-ahead condition or state. In other words, after 
operating the switching means, the driver only has to turn his 
steering wheel (or other steering device) through the 
straight-ahead position in order to cause the change to the 
second mode to occur automatically, leaving the said other 
steering mechanism in the straight-ahead condition.  
 Such an arrangement is described in GB-A-2 208 282, which 
discloses a materials handling vehicle comprising the features defined in the preamble of 
claim 1. This known vehicle has two pairs of wheels 
movable to effect steering of the vehicle, at least one pair of 
wheels being lockable in a position so that steering is effected 
solely by the other pair of wheels, wherein sensor means are 
provided associated with each of the two pairs of wheels to 
provide an electrical signal to a control means when the 
respective wheels are in an aligned position in which their axes 
of rotation are perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the 
vehicle, the control means including a selector means comprising 
electrical switch means to enable an operator to select simple 
steering mode in which only one of the pairs of wheels are 
movable to effect steering, or a compound steering mode in which 
both of the pairs of wheels are movable to effect steering, the 
control means further comprising means to maintain the selected 
steeri

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle comprising: 

a front steering mechanism (1a) and a rear steering 
mechanism (1b), each steering mechanism having an operating range 

including a straight-ahead condition; 
a steering control system (13) operatively connected to the 
front and rear steering mechanisms (1a,1b), the control system 

(13) having a first mode in which both steering mechanisms 
operate and a second mode in which only one steering mechanism 

(1a) operates; 
alignment sensing means (22) for sensing whether the other 
steering mechanism (1b) is in its straight-ahead condition; 
first switching means (21) for switching the control system 
(13) from one mode to the other; and 
second switching means (24) switchable between a first state 
for preventing the change from the first mode to the second mode 

and a second state for permitting the said change; 
the alignment sensing means (22) being operatively connected 
to the second switching means (21) so that, when the first 

switching means (21) is operated to switch the control system 
(13) from the first mode to the second mode, the second switching 

means (24) is in the first state so long as the said other 
steering mechanism (1b) is out of its straight-ahead condition 

and is in the second state when the said other steering mechanism 
(1b) is in its straight-ahead condition; 
  
 

   characterised in that the alignment sensing means (22) is 
activated by the operation of the first switching means (21) to 

switch the control system (13) from the first mode to the second 
mode. 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 1, in which the alignment 
sensing means (22) comprises a fixed sensor (22a;22b) mounted on 

the vehicle and sensing the relative position of a mobile element 
(27) whose movement is a function of the movement of the said 

other steering mechanism (1b). 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 2, in which the mobile 
element (27) is fixed on a pivotable steering arm (6b). 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 2, in which the mobile 
element is constituted by a movable part of a hydraulic steering 

ram (2b). 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 4, in which the said 
movable part is a piston. 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 1, in which the said one 
steering mechanism (1a) is the front steering mechanism, and the 

said other steering mechanism (1b) is the rear steering 
mechanism. 
A vehicle as claimed in claim 1, including third 
switching means (17) for switching the operation of the control 

system (13), while in the first mode, between standard steering 
in which the front and rear steering mechanisms (1a,1b) turn in 

opposite senses and crab steering in which the front and rear 
steering mechanisms (1a,1b) turn in the same sense.
