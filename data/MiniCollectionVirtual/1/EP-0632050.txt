A process for the preparation of 6H-dibenzo[c,e]-[1,2]
-oxaphosphorin-6-one
of the formula



in which R
1
 and R
2
 are identical or different and
are halogen or an alkyl or alkoxy group having

from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and a and b are identical
or different and are 0, 1, 2 or 3, which comprises

reacting a 6-chloro-(6H)-dibenzo[c,e]-[1,2]
oxaphosphorin
of the formula



in which R
1
, R
2
, a and b are as defined above,
with water in a molar ratio of 1:1 at from 50 to

250°C, in the presence if desired of a solvent,
and separating off gaseous hydrogen chloride at

the rate at which it is formed.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein R
1
 and
R
2
 are chlorine or an alkyl or alkoxy group
having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
a and b are 0, 1 or 2, in particular 0 or 1.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 3, wherein a and b are identical and are 0

or 1, in particular zero.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 4, wherein the reaction is carried out at

from 70 to 200°C.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 5, wherein the reaction is carried out at

from 100 to 180°C.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 6, wherein an aromatic compound is employed

as solvent.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims
1 to 7, wherein toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene,

chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene or a
mixture thereof is employed as solvent.
