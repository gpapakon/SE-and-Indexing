<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a traveling
device capable of moving on the surface of an object
having curved faces (hereinafter referred to as a
travel surface), such as the inside or outside
surface of a pipe or the surface of a ship hull, by
means of a plurality of wheels as moving means, or a
plurality of endless tracks, including a plurality of
belt pulleys, as moving means, while performing work
such as sandblasting.The invention also relates to a traveling
device capable of suction-adhering to a travel
surface having curved faces, such as the inside or
outside surface of a pipe or the surface of a ship
hull, by the pressure of an ambient fluid such as air
or water, and capable of moving along the travel
surface by means of a plurality of wheels as moving
means, or a plurality of endless tracks, including a
plurality of belt pulleys, as moving means, while
performing work such as sandblasting.A typical example of a traveling device
capable of suction-adhering to a travel surface
having curved faces, such as the inside or outside
surface of a pipe or the surface of a ship hull, by
the pressure of an ambient fluid such as air or
water, and of moving along the travel surface, while
performing work such as sandblasting, is the device
disclosed in the specification and drawings of U S-A-4,095,378.
The device has a pressure
reduction housing mounted on a frame, a moving means
mounted on the frame, a suction-adhering seal mounted
on the pressure reduction housing and defining a 
pressure reduction space in cooperation with the
pressure reduction housing and the travel surface,
and a pressure reducing means for discharging a fluid
from the pressure reduction space to decrease the
pressure inside the pressure reduction space. The
moving means is composed of a plurality of wheels
(e.g. 4 wheels), or a plurality of endless tracks
including a plurality of belt pulleys (e.g. 2 endless
tracks each with 2 belt pulleys). The traveling
device is equipped with a working unit such as
sandblasting equipment which directs a jet of a
polishing and cleaning material at the transfer
surface.A similar traveling device comprising the features of the first
part of claim 1 is disclosed in the US-A-4 688 289.In the above-described conventional
traveling device, when the pressure reducing means is
actuated, fluid inside the pressure reduction space
is discharged to the outside. Owing to the
difference in fluid pressure between the inside and
outside of the pressure reduction space, the fluid
pressure acts on the pressure reduction
