<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing fusible junction fittings having an 
electric heating wire in a wall thereof comprises the 

steps of making a hollow element of a fusible material and 
rolling up the electric wire on the peripheral surface 

thereof. According to the method, the wire stretch being 
rolled up is heated to a temperature sufficient to enable 

the material of the hollow element to melt, so that said 
wire stretch is at least partly buried in the peripheral 

surface of the hollow element. An apparatus for producing 
the above fittings is characterized in that it comprises 

means (13, 15) for rolling up the wire (16) on the 
peripheral surface of a hollow element (10). In addition, 

heating means (19, 20, 24) are placed along the travel 

path of the wire (16) being rolled up for heating it and 
burying it at least partly in the peripheral surface of 

the hollow element itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for producing fusible fittings for joining pipes. In the known art fusible fittings or sleeves are known 
into which an electric heating resistor is incorporated, 
which resistor, being connected to an appropriate feeding 
equipment, enables melting of the fitting after the latter 
has been mounted to the end of ducts for connecting them, 
said ducts being made of an appropriate fusible material 
too, such as polypropylene for example. These fittings 
enable perfect and highly resistant junctions to be 
readily achieved. However, a uniform distribution of heat over the whole 
volume of the fusible fitting portion is absolutely 
necessary in order to obtain a perfect junction, and 
therefore an accurate arrangement of the resistor in the 
fitting is of the greatest importance. Usually, such a resistor is made in the form of a wire of 
a relatively high resistivity which is wound and 
incorporated in the thickness of the fitting wall. For 
incorporation of the wire in the fitting it has been first 
proposed to arrange the wire according to its final 
configuration, put it into the fitting mould and pour the 
plastic material thereinto. Theoretically this method is very simple, but practically  
 
it is of difficult application. In fact, the liquid 
plastic material entering the mould exerts pressure on the 
wire deforming it and moving it from its ideal location. In an attempt to obviate the above problem, the 
manufacture of the fitting by two moulding steps has been 
suggested. First a support for the wire is moulded, which 
support is generally made in the form of a sleeve having a 
wall of reduced thickness and provided with a 
spiral-shaped channel or groove on the outer surface 
thereof. The resistor wire is laid down into this groove 
and a plastics cover is subsequently moulded onto the 
partial sleeve thus obtained, thereby forming a coating on 
the grooved surface provided with the wire and obtaining a 
complete fitting having the wire incorporated therein. By 
this method displacements of the wire during the second 
moulding step are less likely to occur, as the wire is 
inserted in the guide grooves. However, in addition to the 
difficulty of laying down the wire precisely in the 
preformed groove, this method also suffers from a serious 
drawback. Actually, in order to enable the wire to be inserted into 
the groove, said groove must necessarily have a slightly 
larger section than the wire. Then, due to working 
tolerances, the
