<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a trehalose-releasing
enzyme, and its preparation and uses, more
particularly, to a novel trehalose-releasing enzyme which
specifically hydrolyzes the linkage between a trehalose moiety
and the remaining glycosyl moiety in non-reducing saccharides
having a trehalose structure as an end unit and having a
glucose polymerization degree of 3 or higher, and to the
preparation of the enzyme. The present invention further
relates to microorganisms capable of forming the enzyme,
trehalose obtained by using the enzyme, and compositions
containing the trehalose.Trehalose or α, α-trehalose has been known as a non-reducing
saccharide consisting of glucose units. As is
described in Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry, Vol.18,
pp.201-225 (1963), published by Academic Press, USA, and
Applied and Environmental Microbiology, Vol.56, pp.3,213-3,215
(1990), trehalose widely exists in microorganisms, mushrooms,
insects, etc., though the content is relatively low. Trehalose
is a non-reducing saccharide, so that it neither reacts with 
substances containing amino groups such as amino acids and
proteins, induces the amino-carbonyl reaction, nor deteriorates
amino acid-containing substances. Thus, trehalose would be
used without a fear of causing an unsatisfactory browning and
deterioration. Because of these, the establishment of the
industrial-scale preparation of trehalose has been in great
demand.Conventional preparations of trehalose are, for
example, those which are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No.154,485/75 wherein microorganisms are utilized, and reported
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.216,695/83 wherein maltose is
converted into trehalose by using maltose- and trehalose-phosphorylases
in combination. The former, however, is not
suitable for the industrial-scale preparation because the
content of trehalose present in microorganisms used as a
starting material is usually lower than 15 w/w % (the wording
"w/w %" is abbreviated as "%" in the specification, unless
otherwise specified), on a dry solid basis (d.s.b.), and the
extraction and purification steps are complicated. The latter
has the following demerits: Since trehalose is formed via
glucose-l-phosphate, the concentration of maltose as a
substrate could not be set to a satisfactorily high-level; (ii)
the enzymatic reaction systems of the phosphorylases are
reversible reactions, and their yields of the objective
trehalose are relatively low; and (iii) it is substantially
difficult to retain their reaction systems stably and
