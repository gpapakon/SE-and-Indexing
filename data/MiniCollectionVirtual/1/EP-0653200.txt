<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-component
composition, and in particular, to a multi-component
composition suitable for amalgamation with mercury to form a
dental amalgam, to the amalgam formed therefrom, and to a
method for producing such a multi-component composition.Amalgamable dental alloys are basically alloys of silver
and tin with typical additions of copper and possible
additions of other elements such as indium, zinc, and
palladium. These alloys are supplied to dentists in particle
form. Dentists add mercury to the alloy particles and
triturate the mixture in an amalgamator to form an amalgamated
mass which they, in turn, condense into cavities. Mercury
reacts with silver and tin, forming compounds of silver-mercury
and tin-mercury. The amount of mercury added by the
dentist is not, however, sufficient to complete the reaction.
As a result, mercury only reacts with the surface of the alloy
particles. The core of the particle remains in the unreacted
state. The amalgamated mass placed by a dentist in a cavity
is, after hardening, therefore, a heterogeneous material of at
least three distinct phases: silver-mercury; tin-mercury;
and silver-tin. The phases are, respectively, for convenience
purposes called gamma one, gamma two and gamma. When
properties of the three phases are compared, it is found that 
strength and corrosion resistance are highest for the gamma
phase and lowest for the gamma two phase. Relative ratios of
these three phases, as well as the shape of the original alloy
particles that are left in the final product, determine the
physical properties of amalgamated dental alloys as well as
their ease of manipulation. Alloy particles are typically
spherical or irregular in shape.United States Patent No. 3,871,876 discloses an
amalgamable alloy produced through gas atomization and, more
particularly, particles of amalgamable alloy which are
spherical in shape. The alloy of the patent is, on the one
hand, known for smooth, strong and corrosion resistant dental
restorations; and, on the other hand, for difficulties
encountered in condensing it. Many dentists find that the
spherical particles feel too soft and delicate to them insofar
as the particles have a tendency to be forced up the sides of
a cavity if too much pressure is exerted.An attempt to improve upon the alloy of Patent No.
3,871,876 is disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,997,329.
Irregularly shaped particles are mixed with the spherical
particles of Patent No. 3,871,876 to improve the condensing
characteristics of
