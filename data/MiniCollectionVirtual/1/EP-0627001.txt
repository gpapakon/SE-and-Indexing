<DESCRIPTION>
 MAMMALIAN Sos - A REGULATOR/EFFECTOR OFTYROSINE KINASE SIGNALLINGThis invention broadly relates to polynucleotides encoding mammalian Sos gene and protein product thereof.Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are important regulatoiy proteins that control many aspects of cellular growth, differentiation, and metabolism (Cantley et al., 1991). Many polypeptide hormones are known to regulate the metabolism, differentiation, and growth of target cells by binding transmembrane receptors that possess intracellular PTK domains (Cross and Dexter, 1991).The biological effects of PTK activation throughout mammalian cells may be mediated, at least in part, via the Ras proteins (Simon et al., Cell, Vol. 67, 701-716). ras genes and protein products are associated with a variety of human tumours, particularly where Ras is overproduced or inappropriately expressed.Simon et al. (Supra) identified a Drosophila gene, associated with protein tyrosine kinase signalling. The Drosophila son of sevenless (Sos) gene product is homologous to a yeast protein (CDC25), which is an activator of guanine nucleotide exchange by Ras proteins. The data of Simon et al. (Supra) indicates that tyrosine kinase signalling is effected by activation of the Sos protein (such as via tyrosine phosphorylation, or some form of indirectSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

stimulation), which then activates Ras proteins by exchange GDP for GTP.We have surprisingly identified the mammalian Sos gene, hereinafter referred to as mSos, fragments thereof, which have homology to various guanine exchange factors.In accordance with a first aspect of this invention, there is provided a polynucleotide encoding an mSos gene, or a fragment or analogue thereof. This invention includes any mammalian Sos including human, domestic animal (sheep, cattle, etc) and companion animal (cats, dogs, etc) mSos.The term polynucleotide as referred to herein refers to DNA and RNA, and derivatives thereof as are well known in the art.Partial nucleotide sequences of the murine mSos genes mSosl and mSos2 are shown in Figure 1. This invention includes such polynucleotide sequences and their full length equivalents, as well as analogues thereof where one or more nucleotides are substituted, deleted or inserted. Methods for the generation of polynucleotide analogues are well known in the art.This invention includes vectors, such as plasmid, viral or other vectors as are well known in the art, which include a polynucleotide encoding mSos or a fragment or analogue thereof.In another aspect of this invention,

<CLAIMS>
The claims defining the invention are as follows:
1. A polynucleotide encoding the mammalian son of sevenless gene (mSos), a fragment thereof or an analogue thereof.
2. A polynucleotide according to claim 1 which encodes human mSos or a fragment thereof or an analogue thereof.
3. A polynucleotide according to claim 1 which encodes murine mSosl or mSos2 having a nucleotide sequence as set forth in Figure 1 herewith, or a fragment thereof, or an analogue thereof.
4. An mSos polypeptide, or fragment or analogue thereof.
5. A polypeptide or fragment or analogue thereof according to claim 4 which is a human mSos popypeptide or fragment or analogue thereof.
6. A murine mSos polypeptide having an amino acid sequence corresponding to mSosl or mSos2 as shown in Figure 2, or a fragment thereof or an analogue thereof.
A method of detecting mutant mSos genes in an individual associated with a pathological phenotype which method comprises comparing the nucleotide sequence or chromosomal location or structure of a suspected mutant mSos gene with a reference non mutated mSos gene.
A method of detecting mutant mSos protein which comprises comparing the amino acid sequence of a suspected mSos mutant with a reference mSos protein.
9. A method according to claim 7 or 8 wherein said comparison between a suspected mutant and reference non mutated mSos gene or protein is made by nucleotide 


 sequencing, restriction fragment polymorphism, analysis of amplified products, or analysis of protein sequnce.
10. A method for treating a pathalogical condition associated with a mutant mSos gene/gene product, which comprises administering to a human patient in need of such treatment an antagonist of the mutant mSos, which antagonist blocks the action of mSos on its target.
11. A method of inhibiting a mutant mSos gene/gene product, which comprises administering to a human patient in need of such treatment an antagonist of the mutant mSos, which antagonist blocks the transcription/translation of the mSos gene, or the action of the mSos gene product on its target.
12. A method according to claim 10 or 11 wherein the mSos target is the ras gene, ras gene product, or ras related genes or gene products.
13. An antagonist of mSos which comprises a compound having the same or similar three dimensional structure as an mSos polypeptide or a fragment thereof which blocks the interaction between mSos and its substrate in the PTK signalling pathway.
14. A polynucleotide capable of blocking transcriptions or translation of mSos or fragment thereof comprising a triple helix forming polynucleotide, an antisense polynucleotide or a ribozyme,
15. A vector which includes a polynucleotide according to any one of claims 1 to 3
