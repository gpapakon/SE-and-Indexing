<ABSTRACT>
A cold cathode ionization gauge includes a 
first electrode (12) and a second electrode (20) which 

are spaced apart and insulated from one another and 
have a common axis. A magnetic field generator 

surrounds the gauge and applies a magnetic field along 
the common axis of the electrodes. The magnetic field 

generator includes at least one pair of opposed axially 
magnetized magnets (32, 34) adjacent to each other. 

The magnet arrangement minimizes magnetic flux outside 
the gauge while increasing the strength of the magnetic 

flux inside the gauge. The magnetic arrangement also 
allows the gauge to be ignited in a very high vacuum, 

thereby extending the operating range of the gauge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ionization vacuum gauge for measuring
vacuum in a chamber. The invention is described in the context of, but is not limited
to, an inverted magnetron type cold cathode ionization gauge.Cold cathode ionization gauges are known in the art. Typically, such
gauges are employed for making vacuum measurements, i.e., measurements at very
low pressure [e.g. 13.3 to 13.3 Ã— 10-6 Pa (10-1 to 10-7 torr)]. Three commonly known cold cathode ionization
gauges include normal (noninverted) magnetron type gauges, inverted magnetron
type gauges, and Philips (or Penning) gauges. All of these types of gauges have a
pair of electrodes in an evacuated non-magnetic envelope. The envelope has an
opening which communicates with the vacuum to be measured. A high D.C. voltage
is applied between the electrodes for causing a discharge current to flow therebetween.
A magnetic field is applied along the axis of the electrodes in order to help
maintain the discharge current at an equilibrium value which is a function of pressure.
The level of vacuum of an enclosure connected to such a gauge can thus be
obtained by measuring the amount of the discharge current within the gauge.In contrast with cold cathode gauges, hot filament gauges emit
electrons by heating a filament. The electrons are attracted toward a positively
charged grid electrode. Collisions of electrons with gas molecules produce ions,
which are then attracted to a negatively charged electrode. The current mcasured
at this electrode is directly proportional to the pressure or gas density. One form of prior art normal (noninverted) magnetron type and
inverted magnetron type gauges include a pair of concentric cylinder-shaped electrodes,
typically consisting of an anode and a cathode, spaced apart and insulatcd
from one another. The two cylinders can thus be defined as inner and outer cylinders.
A high voltage is applied between these cylindrical electrodes. The high
voltage accelerates electrons traveling from the negative to the positively charged
cylindrical electrode. A magnet placed around the outer cylinder provides a
magnetic field which is parallel to the axis of the cylinders. This magnetic field
causes the electrons to orbit in the space between the two electrodes instead of going
directly to the positively charged electrode. This long orbiting path increases the
probability of collision of the electrons with residual gas molecules between the inner
and outer cylinders, thus improving the production of positive gas ions. The flow of
these
