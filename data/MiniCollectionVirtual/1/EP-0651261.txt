<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to boundary scan testing of electronic 
circuit networks having individual integrated circuit chips 
testable by the IEEE 1149.1 Standard and other individual 
integrated circuit chips not testable by the IEEE 1149.1 
Standard, but testable by Level Sensitive Scan Design. Modern 
boundary scan testing technology consists of IEEE 1149.1 
Standard boundary scan testing and other methodologies, many 
of which are incompatible with the IEEE 1149.1 Standard. 
Generating test patterns for both types of boundary scan 
testing, as when both types of integrated circuit chips are 
present in the same circuit network, i.e., on the same printed 
circuit board or card, has heretofore been accomplished only 
through special custom programming. According to the system 
and method of the invention described herein, commonly 
available software can be used to automatically generate test 
patterns for circuit networks with mixed integrated circuit 
types. Boundary scan testing is described in many papers, including 
R.W. Bassett, M.E. Turner, J. H. Panner, P.S. Gillis, S.F. 
Oakland, and D.W. Stout, "Boundary Scan Design Principles for 
Efficient LSSD ASIC Testing," IBM Journal of Research and 
Development, Vol. 34, No. 2/3, March/May 1990, pp. 339-354. Heretofore functional testing of printed circuit boards has 
been carried out by test fixtures that facilitated "bed of 
nails" contact of the individual integrated circuit leads.  The development of high pin count devices and surface mount 
technology, with high populations of high I/O density, grid 
array components, on both sides of a card or board, has made 
bed of nails testing prohibitively expensive. To allow bed of 
nails testing, surface mount packages must either sacrifice 
their high I/O advantage and chip density, or even more 
complex and costly testing fixtures must be used. Boundary scan testing provides an alternative to bed of nails 
testing. Boundary scan testing provides board signal node 
access while avoiding in circuit test fixturing. Boundary scan 
techniques replace the physical access points needed for in-circuit 
testing with equivalent logical access points. These 
equivalent logical access points are the boundary scan 
latches. The boundary scan latches correspond to the signal 
I/O pins of each component. The board testing applications of boundary scan methodology 
have led to development of many boundary scan testing 
technologies, including Level Sensitive Scan Design devices 
and IEEE 1149.1 Standard devices. The IEEE
