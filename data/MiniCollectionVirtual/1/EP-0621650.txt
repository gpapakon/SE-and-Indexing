<ABSTRACT>
A switched line type 90° phase shifter includes two 
single pole double throw switches (50,51) which receive an input 

signal to an input terminal (1) and outputs the signal to 
either of two output terminals, or which receive 

two input signals signal to the output 
terminal (2), a reference transmission line (15) having an electrical 

length of α, connected between ones of the two terminals of 
the first and the second single pole double throw switches, 

a phase difference producing transmission line (14) having an 
electrical length of (90°+α) in the usage frequency, 

connected between the others of the two terminals of the 
first and the second single pole double throw switches, a 

phase inverting circuit (16) provided switchablely between a 
state of being inserted serially to and between two parts (15a,15b) of 

the reference transmission line, which two parts produce the 
entirety of the reference transmission line, the one 

terminal of the first single pole double throw switch is an 
input terminal of the entire terminal and one terminal of 

the second single pole double throw switch is an output 
terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 90° phase shifter,
and more particularly, to a switched line type phase
shifter.Figure 8 is a circuit diagram of a conventional
switched line type phase shifter. In the figure,
reference numeral 1 designates an input terminal and
reference numeral 2 designates an output terminal. Four
field effect transistors 3 are provided at two paths from
the input terminal 1 or at the two paths to the output
terminal 2 (hereinafter referred to as "FET"). Reference
numeral 4 designates resonance lines connected between
source and drain electrodes of the FETs 3, respectively, to
constitute resonance inductances, respectively. Reference
numeral 5 designate gate bias terminals of respective FETs
3. A reference line 6 having a predetermined electrical
length α is provided between the other end of one of the
input side two FETs 3 and the other end of one of the output
side two FETs 3. A phase difference producing line 7 having
an electrical length (α + β) which is longer than that of
the reference line 6 by a desired electrical length β is
provided between the other end of the other one of the input
side two FETs 3 and the other end of the other one of the 
output side two FETs 3.Description is given of the operation.This switched line type phase shifter is constituted by
two single pole double throw switches 50 and 51 which
receive signals to the one input terminal 1, 2 and output
the signals to either of the two output terminals 40a and
40b, 41a and 41b, and two transmission lines 6 and 7
connected between respective output terminals of the one or
the other of the two switches, that have electrical length
α, (α + β), respectively. Therefore, by switching the path
for the input signal which is input to the input terminal 1
of this phase shifter between that transmitted on the
reference line 6 having an electrical length α to reach the
output terminal 2 of this phase shifter, or that transmitted
on the transmission line 7 having an electrical length (α +
β) which is longer by a desired electrical length β than the
reference line 6, a phase quantity of the difference β in
the electrical length is obtained.In other words, the switched line type phase shifter
shown in figure 8 performs a switching operation by the
resonance circuit comprising the FET 3 and the resonance
line 4. When the gate bias voltage of the FET 3 is set at
zero volt, the path between the source and drain electrodes
can be seen of equivalently a low resistance of below
several Ω, meaning an on-state. When the gate bias
