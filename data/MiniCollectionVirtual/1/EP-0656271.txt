<ABSTRACT>
A ring-disc like rubber elastic sealing wall (5) with sealing lips (13,14) around the edge is connected to the inner metal part (2) which can be connected to the vehicle frame and is fitted in a third radial plane opposite the stop (4) off-set towards the axial articulated bush outside. An assembly tube (17) is pushed over the axial length of the bush (1) comprising the outer tube (11), stop area and sealing wall (5). This assembly tube has a longitudinal slit over the entire length and is pressed into the socket eye (15) so that the slit which is open when not pressed in substantially closes when it is pressed in and the rubber layer (9) becomes pretensioned and the rubber sealing wall becomes sealingly radially clamped. In the unstressed state the diameter of the outer tube and that of the sealing wall are substantially the same.

<CLAIMS>
A pivoting bearing, in particular for an axle guide of a motor vehicle,

with a cylindrical articulated bush (1) consisting of an inner metal component (2) that

can as a first bearing component be connected to a vehicle chassis in particular, an
outer tube (11), and at least one first rubber layer (9) inserted by vulcanization with a

firmly adhesive effect between the inner metal component (2) and the outer tube (11),
wherein the outer tube (11) has at least one longitudinal slot (24) whose slot depth

extends well into the rubber layer (9), and
with a receiving opening (15) as a second bearing component which is connected in
particular to an axle guide into which the articulated bush (1) is introduced with radial

prestressing, wherein the articulated bush (1) is pressed in in the axial direction with its
diameter being larger in its unloaded state as compared with the receiving opening (15),

into the receiving opening (15) with its smaller diameter with a uniform reduction of this
diameter, and the longitudinal slot (24) designed with an appropriate slot width in the

unloaded state of the articulated bush (1) has been closed thereby, so that the first
rubber layer (9) thereby becomes a closed first rubber ring lying in a first radial plane as

the articulated bush component (3) with a load- bearing function, and a firm joint is
established in this rubber layer (9) between the receiving opening (15) and the

articulated bush (1) because of the prestressing,
with an annular peripheral stop (4) axially offset with respect to the first rubber layer (9),
connected to the inner metal component (2) and lying in a second radial plane, which

stop is dimensioned in such a way that in the pressed-in state, there remains a
peripheral air gap (23) opposite the zone of the receiving opening (15), axially covering

the stop (4), so that the stop function operates in the case of a radial spring deflection
path that is greater than the air gap (23), 
with a further second rubber ring, which lies offset with respect to the stop (4) towards
the axial outer side of the articulated bush in a third radial plane and is connected to the

inner metal component (2), and
with a mounting tube (17) that is fitted over the axial length of the articulated bush (1),
that is to say, the outer tube (11), the first rubber layer (9) and the zone of the stop (4),

which has at least one longitudinal mounting tube slot (18, 19) and which is also
pressed into the receiving opening (15), in which process the longitudinal mounting tube

slot (18, 19) which is open in its nonpressed-in state, has largely closed during the
pressing-in action, whereby the rubber layer (9), being the articulated bush component

(3) with a load bearing function, is prestressed,

characterized in that

the second rubber ring is not a pressure-prestressed articulated bush component with a
loading bearing function surrounded by an outer tube, but an annular disk-shaped

elastic sealing wall (5) with a sealing lip (13, 14) peripherally disposed at the edge, and
that the mounting tube (17) is additionally also fitted over the sealing wall (5), whereby
the rubber sealing wall (5) with its sealing lip (13, 14) peripherally disposed edgewise is

radially held with a sealing effect.
A pivoting bearing according to claim 1, characterized in that in the unloaded not
yet pressed-in state, the diameter of the outer tube (11) and of the annular sealing wall

(5) are approximately of equal size.
A pivoting bearing according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that in the
unloaded not yet pressed-in state, the sealing wall (5) has in the annular zone of the

rubber a peripheral bulge (12) towards the centre of the bearing. 
A pivoting bearing according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that at the
edge of the sealing wall (5), there are provided two radially projecting sealing lips (13,

14) which are separated from each other by a peripheral gap (25).
A pivoting bearing according to claim 4, characterized in that the first outer
sealing lip (13) is thicker than the second inner sealing lip (14) and

that in the zone of the first sealing lip (13), the sealing wall (5) has a somewhat smaller
radial diameter than in the zone of the second sealing lip (14), so that in the unloaded

not yet pressed-in state, the second sealing lip (14) radially projects beyond the first
sealing lip (13).
A pivoting bearing according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the stop
(4) consists of a harder material as compared with the rubber layer (9).
A pivoting bearing according to claim 6, characterized in that, as a peripheral
metal stop ring (7), the stop (4) is a component part of the inner metal component (2)

and

that a rubber stop layer (8) is deposited on the metal stop ring (7).
A pivoting bearing according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that at least
one metal plate is also inserted by vulcanization into the rubber layer (9) as an

intermediate plate (10).
A pivoting bearing according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the
axial length of the rubber layer (9) corresponds approximately to the axial length of the

stop (4). 
A pivoting bearing according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that at its
two end edges, the mounting tube (17) is, at least in part zones, flanged over towards

the receiving opening (15), (projections (20), and/or towards the outer tube (11) or
towards the sealing wall (5) (projections (21).
A pivoting bearing according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that at the
peripheral face of the mounting tube (17), supports (tongues 22) are notched out

towards the bearing axis in the zone of the edge of the outer tube (11) on the internal
side of the bearing, which tongues support the outer tube (11) against displacement

towards the axial bearing centre.
A pivoting bearing according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that a thin
rubber layer is applied on the peripheral face of the outer tube (11).
