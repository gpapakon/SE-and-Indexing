<ABSTRACT>
In an integrated resonant cavity optical filter, the resonant cavity (2) is 
obtained with optical waveguide sections (5a...5c, 6a...6c, 7, 8) making up two facing 

Y-shaped couplers joined at the ends of the arms (5a, 5b, 7, 6a, 6b, 8) of the Y's. The 
arms of the Y's (5a, 5b, 7, 6a, 6b, 8) are single-mode waveguide sections, while the 

legs of the Y's (5c, 6c) are two-mode waveguide sections, made reflecting at their free 
ends (9, 10), having such a length that the radiation to be selected entering one of the 

two-mode sections (5c; 6c) from one of the single-mode sections (5a; 6b) passes 
from the same two-mode section, upon reflection at the end, to the other single-mode 

section (5b; 6a) of cavity (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to components for optical communication systems and, more
particularly, regards a resonant filter which can be implemented with integrated optics technology,
to be used for example in a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) communication system.It is known that in WDM communication systems the number of channels which can
actually be used is determined by the characteristics of the filters used for multiplexing and
demultiplexing. It is also known that from this point of view good results have been obtained by
using resonant cavity filters. In such filters the number of channels depends on the so-called
"finesse" of the filter, namely, on the ratio between the free spectral range, i.e., the distance between
two consecutive transmission peaks, and the peak bandwidth: the higher the finesse, the greater the
number of channels that can be transmitted.Wide free spectral ranges can be obtained by using very short resonant cavities. The
simplest solution in order to obtain very short cavities would be using a rectilinear waveguide with
end mirrors, that is, a structure of the Fabry-Perot type. However, a rectilinear cavity has a serious
shortcoming, as all of the power outside the transmission band is reflected back to the sources,
thereby disturbing the emission characteristics of same. For this reason, it would be better to use
ring cavities, which form unidirectional resonant filters.Examples of filters with resonant ring cavities are described by T. Kominato et al. in the
paper "Ring Resonators Composed of GeO2-Doped Silica Waveguides", Journal of Lightwave 
Technology, Vol. 10, No. 12, December 1992, and by K. Oda et al. in the paper "A Wide-Band
Guided-Wave Periodic Multi/Demultiplexer with a Ring Resonator for Optical FDM Transmission
Systems", Journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol. 6, No. 6, June 1988. However, the curvature
radius of ring cavities cannot be reduced below a certain limit, usually a few millimeters, because
otherwise curvature losses would be too high. Consequently, the free spectral range obtained is
relatively limited (in the order of 10 GHz), and the device is relatively cumbersome.In order to increase the free spectral range, the use has been proposed of a double ring
resonant cavity, as described by K. Oda et al. in the paper "A Wide FSR Waveguide Double- Ring
Resonator for Optical FDM Transmission Systems", Journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol. 9, No.
6, June 1991; anyway, a double ring system has higher losses and is still more cumbersome.The purpose

<CLAIMS>
Integrated optical filter, comprising: a resonant cavity (2); an input
waveguide (3) forming together with a first section of the resonant cavity (2) a

directional coupler for transferring to the resonant cavity signals from a wavelength
division multiplexed stream; and an output waveguide (4) forming together with

a second section of the resonant cavity (2) a directional coupler for extraction from
the resonant cavity of a radiation at a desired wavelength, characterized in that

said resonant cavity (2) is formed by optical waveguides (5a...5c, 6a...6c, 7, 8)
which make up two facing Y-shaped couplers, joined at the ends of the arms (5a,

5b, 7, 6a, 6b, 8) of the Y's, and in that the waveguides (5a, 5b, 7, 6a, 6b, 8)
making up such arms are single-mode waveguides forming said first and second

sections of the resonant cavity which thus are single-mode sections, and the
waveguide sections (5c, 6c) forming the legs of the Y's are two-mode waveguide

sections, made reflecting at their free ends (9, 10) and having such a length that
a radiation at the desired wavelength entering one of the two-mode sections (5c;

6c) from one of the single-mode sections (5a; 6b) passes from the same two-mode
section, upon reflection at its end, to the other single-mode section (5b; 6a)

of the cavity (2).
Integrated optical filter according to claim 1, characterized in that the
optical waveguides (5a...5c, 6a...6c, 7, 8) forming the cavity (2) are active optical

waveguides, and the reflecting end (9; 10) of at least one of the two-mode
waveguide sections (5c, 6c) forms a dichroic mirror reflecting said desired wavelength

an allowing injection into the cavity of a pump radiation.
