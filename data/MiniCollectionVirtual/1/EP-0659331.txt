<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a direct-sowing machine with seed supply containers and with seed conduits extending from these and leading to seed tine coulters (2), the coulter tips of which are directed forwards in the direction of travel, there being arranged next to the seed tine coulter (2) a pressure means for fixing a ground support (16) consisting, for example, of plant material, which pressure means is designed to be movable in the direction of movement of the seed tine coulter (2), the relative speed of the pressure means in relation to the ground support layer or the ground surface being lower than the relative speed of the seed coulter (2) in relation to the ground.
