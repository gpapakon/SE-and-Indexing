<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the field of automation 
and computer engineering. It concerns in particular an 
inductional, semi-automatic method for reading the 
coordinates of three-dimensional objects (scale models, 
models) with a complicated structure and the input of 
these data in a computer. The invention can also be used without any restrictions 
whatsoever for reading the coordinates of two-dimensional 
objects (such as drawings, diagrams, maps, etc.) and for 
their input in a computer. Electromechanical methods are already known for the semi-automatic 
reading of the information of three-dimensional 
objects. Such a method is described in the Japanese 
patent application No 1-94420 for a "computer-oriented 
reading device for three-dimensional information"; 
IZOBRETENIA STRAN MIRA 1990, N6, p. 78. The method is 
based on the use of the three-dimensional pantographical 
system, whereby use is made of three three-dimensionally 
moveable levers which are connected to the stationary 
support and the actual coordinate reading device. The levers are connected to one another by means of 
sensors which measure the angular displacement, whose 
information, taking into account the (known) length of 
the lever arms, can be used as basic data for the 
calculation (identification) of the three-dimensional 
coordinates of a specific point (peak point) of the 
coordinate reading device, which was superposed by the 
operator on a point of the object to be measured.  
 This method is disadvantageous in that it is little 
accurate, due to the presence of several sensors which 
measure the angular displacements (sensors of the "angle-code" 
type), and the large dimensions of the lever arms 
which make it difficult to meet the demands of mechanical 
rigidity, and finally the limited functional 
possibilities of such devices, due to the mass inertia of 
the system and the impossibility to measure the 
complicated inner faces of objects. More resemblance to the here described invention bear the 
methods on the basis of induction which are applied for 
the semi-automatic reading of surface and three-dimensional 
coordinates, such as the method described in 
the USSR author's certificate No. 550 548 for: "Device 
for reading graphic information" (BULLETEN IZOBRETENII N 
10). This method implies the generation of a variable 
magnetic field in two points of the coordinate axis which 
are part of the three-dimensional coordinate system which 
is realized with a certain increase in the digitization 
of the working
