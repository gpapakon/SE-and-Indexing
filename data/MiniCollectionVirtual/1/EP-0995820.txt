<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a fluoride refining method and
a fluoride crystal manufacturing method that have great

general-purpose properties and can reduce the
manufacturing cost and to provide at a low cost a

fluoride crystal, an optical part and an aligner the
transmission characteristics of which are hardly

degraded even when repeatedly irradiated with a high-output
light of a short wavelength for a long term,

there is provided a method of refining a fluoride
comprising the heating step of heating a solid

scavenger-added fluoride raw material to melt the raw
material and the cooling step of cooling the molten

fluoride material to solidify the melt, wherein the
environment of a chamber housing the fluoride raw

material is changed to such an environment that a gas
in the chamber is discharged to the outside of the

chamber more easily than the environment before the
change, during the heating step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluoride
refining method and a fluoride crystal manufacturing
method which are suitable for various optical elements,
lenses, window materials, prisms or the like used for a
light of a predetermined wavelength selected from a
wide wavelength range between the vacuum ultraviolet
region and the far infrared region. Further, the
present invention relates to a technical field of
optical parts and an aligner using the same.A fluoride crystal such as one of calcium fluoride
has a high transmittance in a wide wavelength range
between the vacuum ultraviolet region and the far
infrared region, and is widely used for various optical
elements, lenses, window materials, prisms or the like.
Among them, fluorite (calcium fluoride) which is
excellent in transmission characteristics at shorter
wavelength is useful as an optical part for excimer
laser. In particular, a calcium fluoride crystal of
70% or more in its internal transmittance to light of 
135 nm in wavelength has a superior durability to an
ArF excimer laser, and its transmission characteristics
are less degraded by repeated irradiation with high-output
laser.For such a fluoride crystal, a process for melting
and refining a raw material is required to increase
bulk density of the raw material and remove impurities
of the raw material. In this refining process, a
scavenger which is a metal fluoride must be added to a
raw material to remove an oxide produced by a reaction
of the raw material with water or the like, or
impurities in the raw material. For example, when the
fluoride crystal is calcium fluoride, and when the
scavenger is solid ZnF2, CaO produced by a reaction of
the raw material with water reacts with ZnF2 to be
converted to CaF2, while the scavenger becomes ZnO to
evaporate during melting of the raw material.When a high-quality fluoride crystal with superior
optical performance is to be obtained, the above
mentioned refining process must be repeated several
times. In addition, a raw material of a high purity
with less impurities must be employed.When a crystal is manufactured using the thus
obtained fluoride crystal block as a raw material, a
fluoride crystal with very superior optical performance
such as transmission characteristics is obtained.On the other hand, there is a method in which a 
gaseous scavenger is used instead of a solid scavenger.
A reactive gas that can be used as a gaseous scavenger
includes hydrogen fluoride gas or carbon fluoride gas.However, since the solid scavenger contains a
metal
