<ABSTRACT>
A variable magnification copier apparatus (8) includes an optical system which 
incorporates two pairs of moving mirror assemblies (30,38) which are moved to maintain object 

and image conjugate requirements following magnification changes. Also included is a 
constant focal length lens (34) movable between two segments (22F,22D) of a folded optical 

path. The optical system provides a magnification range of between 0.45X and 2.0X, while 
positioning the optical elements in a compact design. The lens (34) does not move along the 

optical path, but rather remains fixed in position along one path segment so long as 
magnification values are selected within a certain range. When the magnification value is 

selected outside the predetermined range, the lens (34) moves to an adjacent segment of the 
optical path and remains in a second, fixed position so long as further magnification values are 

selected within a second range. When a range is selected outside the second range, the lens 
(34) is moved back to the first position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable magnification copying apparatus and, 
more particularly, to an optical system for such an apparatus. A variety of copiers are commercially used which produce reduced or enlarged copies 
of original documents. A preferred optical system incorporates optical elements which scan a 
document line by line. The following patents illustrate the various optical systems used to 
enable the variable magnification. US-A-4,498,759 and 4,538,904 are illustrative of optical systems which scan a 
stationary document placed in an object plane. Full rate/half rate mirrors move to adjust object 
and image conjugates, while a fixed focal length lens moves along the optical path to selected 
positions, depending upon magnification selection. US-A-5,063,406 illustrates an optical system where the document is moved past a 
fixed exposure station, where a zoom lens is adapted to enlarge and reduce the scanned 
image, and where a first and a second mirror assembly are movably provided. US-A-4,040,733; 4,172,658 and 4,639,121 disclose variable magnification systems 
where the imaging lens moves along the optical path to different magnification locations and 
also moves perpendicular to the axis to maintain registration. A compact optical design is a 
desirable objective when designing a variable magnification copier. Prior art efforts to provide 
a compact design are disclosed in US-A-4,027,963 and 4,374,619. These patents incorporate a 
half lens element which includes a mirror in the lens assembly, reducing the need for an 
additional folding mirror elsewhere along the optical path, thus making the system more 
compact. Reduction copying in a limited space is also disclosed in "Optical Reduction System", 
Xerox Disclosure Journal, Vol. 5, No. 1, January/February 1980, page 97. One object of the present invention is to provide a variable magnification copying 
apparatus having a cost effective, versatile, compact optical system design. Accordingly, the present invention provides a variable magnification copying 
apparatus and optical system according to any one of the appended claims. The preferred embodiments of the present invention are directed towards a novel, 
variable magnification optical system which incorporates mirror pairs movable along an optical 
path to adjust object and image conjugates during magnification changes, but which does not 
require lens translation along the optical path. Rather, the lens, in a preferred embodiment, is 
a constant focal length wide angle
