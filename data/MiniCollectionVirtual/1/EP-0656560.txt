<ABSTRACT>
A multi-colored pixel for a twisted nematic liquid 
crystal display including red, green, and blue subpixels, 

wherein each subpixel includes a pair of substrates, a 
pair of polarizers (202,220), opposing electrodes, and a color 

personalized retardation film (208,210,212) which compensates for the 
different wavelength of each color. The personalized 

retardation films of the different color subpixels 
results in elimination of the multi-gap approach and 

substantially eliminates the problem of different color 
leakages at different viewing angles, including normal. 

Also, one polymer based element, preferably a polyimide, 
functions as both a color filter and a retardation film 

in certain embodiments of this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the design of a liquid
crystal display having at least one retardation film
therein. More particularly, this invention relates to
the design of a polychromatic or multicolored liquid
crystal display and techniques for eliminating color
leakages and maximizing the field of view of such
displays.Liquid crystal materials are useful for electronic
displays because light traveling through a layer of
liquid crystal (LC) material is affected by the
anisotropic or birefringent value (ΔN) of the material,
which in turn can be controlled by the application of a
voltage across the liquid crystal material. Liquid
crystal displays are desirable because the transmission
or reflection of light from an external source, including
ambient light and backlighting schemes, can be controlled
with much less power than was required for the
illuminance materials used in other previous displays.
Liquid crystal displays are now commonly used in such
applications as digital watches, calculators, portable
computers, avionic cockpit displays, and many other types
of electronic devices which utilize the liquid crystal 
display advantages of long life and operation with low
voltage and power consumption.The information in many liquid crystal displays is
presented in the form of a matrix array of rows and
columns of numerals or characters, which are generated by
a number of segmented electrodes arranged in such a
matrix pattern. The segments are connected by individual
leads to driving electronics, which apply a voltage to
the appropriate combination of segments to thereby
display the desired data and information by controlling
the light transmitted through the liquid crystal
material. Graphic information in, for example, avionic
cockpit applications or television displays may be
achieved by a matrix of pixels which are connected by an
X - Y sequential addressing scheme between two sets of
perpendicular conductor lines (i.e. row and column
lines). More advanced addressing schemes use arrays of
thin film transistors or diodes which act as switches to
control the drive voltage at the individual pixels.
These schemes are applied predominantly to twisted
nematic liquid crystal displays, but are also finding use
in high performance versions of super twisted liquid
crystal displays.Contrast is one of the most important attributes
determining the quality of both normally white (NW) and
normally black (NB) liquid crystal displays. In normally
black (NB) LCDs, the primary factor limiting the contrast 
achievable in
