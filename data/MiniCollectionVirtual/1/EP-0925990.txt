<ABSTRACT>
A control system/method for controlling engine brake (50) assisted
upshifts in a vehicular, at least partially automated transmission system (10).

A value representing expected engine brake turn-off reaction time (T
REACTION

is adjusted as a function of sensed engine deceleration (dES/dt) at the time

just prior to completing the assisted upshift.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to copending EP 686 789 (US 5 655 407),
which discloses the features of the preamble
of claim 1, and US-A-5 842 376.The present invention relates to a control system/method for
controlling the shifting of vehicular fully or partially automated mechanical
transmission systems of the type including an engine equipped with an
engine retarding device or devices, such as a compression brake, and in
particular, relates to a control system/method of the above-described type
which is effective to adaptively determine the optimal time to deactivate the
retarding device or devices to achieve rapid and smooth upshifting.Vehicular fully and partially automated mechanical transmission
systems are known in the prior art as may be seen by reference to U.S. Pats.
No. 4,361,060; 4,595,986; 4,648,290; 4722,248; 5,050,427; 5,136,897;
5,335,566 and 5,582,558.Such fully or partially automated mechanical transmission systems
typically include a microprocessor-based controller for issuing command
output signals to various controllers to implement or assist selected
transmission shifts, including manipulation of the engine fueling and/or of
engine or input shaft brakes to cause the transmission input shaft to rotate 
at a substantially synchronous speed for a given output shaft speed and
target gear ratio.Engine brakes, usually called "engine compression brakes" or "exhaust
brakes" are well known in the prior art and such devices, such as the well
known "Jake brake," are commonly provided on heavy duty vehicles. These
devices are typically manually operated, may provide variable retardation by
manual selection of one, two or three banks of cylinders operation, and are
utilized to retard the vehicle and, in recent developments, to quickly retard
engine/input shaft speed for more rapid synchronization during an upshift.
Examples of vehicular automated mechanical transmission systems utilizing
automatically actuated engine brakes may be seen by reference to U.S. Pats.
No. 4,933,850; 5,042,327; 5,409,432 and 5,425,689.Generally, as is well known in the prior art, engine compression brakes
are effective to alter, usually hydraulically, the engine valve timing/porting so
that a relatively large compressive force and resistance is provided to rotation
of the engine and the vehicle drive wheels acting through to drive axles,
drive shaft, transmission and master clutch.Other devices and techniques to selectively retard engine rotation are
also known. By way of example, by increasing the load on

<CLAIMS>
A control method for controlling upshifting in a vehicular, at least
partially automated mechanical transmission system (10) comprising a

throttle controlled engine (14) a mechanical change gear transmission (12)
having a plurality of gear ratio combinations selectively engageable between

a transmission input shaft (26) and a transmission output shaft (18), each
of said gear ratio combinations defining a numerical ratio of input shaft

rotational speed to output shaft rotational speed, an information processing
unit (54) having means for receiving a plurality of input signals including an

input signal (ES) indicative of the rotational speed of said engine and an input

speed (OS) indicative of the rotational speed of said output shaft and means
for processing said input signals in accordance with predetermined logic rules

for generating command output signals (54B) whereby said transmission
system is operated in accordance with said logic rules, an engine brake (50)

selectively actuatable to provide a retarding torque to rotation of said engine,
and actuators responsive to said command output signals including an engine

brake actuator for selectively applying said engine brake, said control method
comprising the steps of, upon initiating an engine brake-assisted upshift

into a target gear ratio (GR
T
) by activating the engine brake after sensing a
transmission-neutral condition:


(a) sensing values indicative of one or more of engine speed, rate of
change of engine speed, output shaft speed, and rate of change of output

shaft speed;
(b) determining an engine brake reaction time (T
REACTION
) value
indicative of a period of time required for the engine brake to cease providing

a retarding torque to resist rotation of the engine from initiation of a
command signal to said engine brake actuator to deactivate said engine

brake;
(c) issuing a command signal to said engine brake actuator to
deactivate said engine brake at a time determined as a function of (i) the 

numerical ratio of the target gear ratio (GR
T
), (ii) one or more of output shaft
speed and rate of change thereof, (iii) one or more of engine speed and rate

of change thereof and (iv) engine brake reaction time, 
characterized by
 the step
(d) after the passage of said reaction time from issuing said
command signal to said engine brake actuator, sensing the then current value

of the rate of change of engine speed (dES/dt) and modifying said engine
brake reaction time as a function of said current value of said rate of change

of engine speed.
The method of claim 1 wherein said system further comprises a
transmission actuator responsive to said command output signals for

selectively engaging and disengaging selected gear ratios and step (d) further
comprises commanding engagement of said target gear ratio.
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said value of said engine brake
reaction time is decreased if the then current value of the rate of change of

engine speed is less than a first reference value (REF
1
) and is increased if the
then current value of the rate of change of engine speed is greater than a

second reference value (REF
2
), said first reference value being lower than
said second reference value (REF
1
 
<
 REF
2
). 
The method of claim 3 wherein said engine has an expected rate
of change of engine speed with the engine brake active and a different

expected rate of change of engine speed with the engine brake not active,
and said first reference value is similar to the expected rate fo change of

engine speed with the engine brake activated, and the second reference
value is similar to the expected rate of change of engine speed with the

engine brake deactivated.
