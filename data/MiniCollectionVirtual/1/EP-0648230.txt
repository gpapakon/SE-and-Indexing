<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transition metal polymerization catalyst systems
from Groups 5-10, wherein the active transition metal center is in a high oxidation
state and stabilized by low coordination number polyanionic ancillary ligand
systems, the use thereof, and to method of preparing and using the same.Traditional Ziegler-Natta type catalysts for the polymerization of olefins
have been known since the 1950's. Generally, these catalysts comprise a transition
metal halide compound, particularly one of titanium and chloride, and a metal alkyl
cocatalyst, particularly an aluminum alkyl cocatalyst. The traditional catalyst
systems are generally comprised of several chemically distinct active metal sites
which produce different polymeric materials (molecular weight comonomer, etc.)
under steady state reactor conditions. During the last 30 years of development,
traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysts have been optimized and provide low cost routes
to a variety of commercially important polyolefins, however further improvements
over the control of key polymer structure parameters such as molecular weight
distribution (MWD), 
composition distribution (CD), end group functionality, sequence distribution
and polar comonomer compatibility are still needed.Recent progress to improve the Ziegler-Natta system has been directed
towards the production of soluble, single sited olefin polymerization catalysts
derived from transition metal precursors where the halide ligands used in
tradition catalysts have been replaced by bulky, organic ancillary ligand
systems, such as cyclopentadienyl (Cp) derivatives. In contrast to simple halide
ligands, the bulky ancillary ligand systems are not susceptable to removal or
change during polymerization, stabilize a single form of the catalyst, and can be
modified in a rational way to change the properties of the catalyst center. The
development of high activity catalyst systems derived from bis- and mono- Cp
stabilized Group 4 metal precursors and alumoxanes is now well documented.
Despite the fact that the cocatalyst (and therefore the resulting catalyst) is a
chemically complex mixture of aluminum alkyl reagents, the active catalyst
generally behaves as a single sited catalyst and produces narrow MWD
polyolefins.Recent advances in the art have led to the development of well defined
(discrete), ancillary ligand stabilized single-sited olefin polymerization catalysts
of the Group 3 and 4 transition metals. These systems do not rely on the use
of alkyl aluminum cocatalysts, and offer
