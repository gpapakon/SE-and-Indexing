<ABSTRACT>
In contrast to previous approaches, the present inventors have 
discovered that diamond films can be grown by carbon CVT reactions occurring 

exclusively in the exothermic regime, where the lower temperature (
<
1500C) 
conditions considerably simplify the equilibrium gas phase chemistry. Under these 

conditions of a small temperature gradient and short transport distance between the 
source and substrate, supersaturation of the gas phase with regard to graphite and 

diamond does not attain sufficiently high values to induce spontaneous 
homonucleation of graphite and diamond in the gas phase. With this process, 

temperatures as low as 680 C were found to be sufficient to induce the growth of 
continuous diamond films free of non-diamond allotropes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for growing diamond films,
and, in particular, to a method of growing diamond films by chemical vapor transport
which produces films of high purity compared to previously known processes.Diamond films are useful in a wide variety of applications such as
providing heat sinks for microelectronic devices and cutting surfaces for industrial
tools.One known method for growing diamond films is by chemical vapor
transport (CVT). CVT reactions of carbon for the deposition of diamond were
reported by B. V. Spitsyn et al, 52 J.CrystalGrowth 219-226 (1981). Subsequently,
Piekarczyk and coworkers performed detailed thermodynamic analyses of the
carbon-hydrogen binary system and examined carbon-hydrogen CVT theoretically in
terms of a four-stage transport model. See W. Piekarczyk et al, 106J.CrystalGrowth
279-93 (1990). These investigators analyzed the solid-gas phase equilibria
existing for graphite and diamond over a defined regime of pressure 104 - 10-3 Pa
(0.1 - 10-8 atm.) and temperature (850 - 3000K) in a closed system of hydrogen.
From the solubility plots for graphite and diamond in hydrogen versus temperature,
they constructed a model for the transport cycle leading to diamond deposition.
Using the model, Piekarczyk and coworkers evaluated data reported in the literature
and confirmed experimentally that deposition of diamond could proceed readily from
gas solutions undersaturated with respect to diamond.The difficulty with these known processes, however, is that along with
diamond, they also deposit substantial amounts of graphite. High temperatures
(1350 - 1650C) were used to rapidly react the carbon source (graphite) with
hydrogen for deposition of diamond on a substrate at 600 - 1100C. For example, in international application serial no. WO 90/07586,
entitled "Improved Diamond Deposition Cell", there is described a cell for making
diamond films involving a process in which there is a relatively large temperature
gradient between the substrate and graphite elements, i.e., the graphite is heated to
about 1800K to 3000K, and the substrate is maintained at temperatures in the range
of 700K to 1400K. In such cases the gas phase is saturated with graphite at even
higher levels than for diamond. Thus, the certain deposition of graphite with respect
to diamond occurs according to the reverse of the reaction
xC(s,gra) + 1/2yH2(g) =CxHy(g)
The result, indicated by Raman spectra, is low quality film including high levels of
graphite. Another method for performing the CVT
