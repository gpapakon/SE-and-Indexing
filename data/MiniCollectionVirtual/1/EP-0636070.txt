<ABSTRACT>
A spectacle retainer, in particular for installation in motor vehicles consists of a support (30) with a base member (30b) and a rear wall (30a) with spectacle carriers (31), as well as a spectacle rest (33, 34, 50, 90 and 90b) arranged on the support (30), which can quickly and comfortably be adapted by the user by means of an adjustment system (40, 80) to suit the sizes of various models of spectacles. The spectacles (100) can be removed from or inserted in the retaining device with one hand, and the spectacle sidepieces (100c) can be opened out or closed back on the spectacles. The spectacle retainer is designed as a single assembly and can be installed in a variety of protective casings, and by means of an extension system can be moved from an inner engagement position, in which the spectacle retainer is substantially enclosed in the protective casing, into an outer engagement position, in which the spectacles can be removed from or inserted in the retainer.

A spectacle holder, in particular for installation 
in motor vehicles, which comprises a carrier (1, 30, 

110, 200) having a rear wall (2, 30a, 110a) and a rest 
(4a, 4b, 31) arranged on the rear wall (2, 30a, 110a) 

for supporting a spectacle frame of a pair of spectacles 
(7, 100, 150) inserted in the spectacle holder 

at the lower point of a circumference of each of its 
lenses; and having a pressure plate (10, 34, 120) 

movably joined to the carrier (1, 30, 110, 200) by way 
of a parallel guide means (6, 11, 33c, 34c, 33a, 34a) 

and having resilient means (10, 90, 140), which pressure 
plate leaves open empty spaces on both sides for 

opening out and folding up spectacle side-pieces (7a, 
100c, 151) of a pair of spectacles (7, 100, 150) 

inserted in the spectacle holder on a side of the 
pressure plate (10, 34, 120) remote from the rear wall 

(2, 30a, 110a), wherein the resilient means (10, 90, 
140) for firmly clamping a pair of spectacles (7, 100, 

150) inserted in the spectacle holder between the rear 
wall (2, 3a, 110a) and the pressure plate (10, 34, 120) 

press the pressure plate (10, 34, 120) towards the rear 
wall (2, 30a, 110a), characterised in that the spectacle 

holder has an adjusting element (6a, 13a, 33e, 
146) with which a distance between the rear wall (2, 

30a, 110a) and the pressure plate (10, 34, 120) when no 
pair of spectacles (7, 100, 150) is inserted is adjustable 

to adapt to the thickness of a pair of spectacles 
(7, 100, 150) to be inserted in the spectacle holder. 
A spectacle holder according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the distance between the rear  

 
wall (2, 30a, 110a) and the pressure plate (10, 34, 

120) can be adjusted by means of an adjusting screw 
(6a, 13a, 33e, 146) or an adjusting nut (40, 146a) 

which is connected to the rear wall (2) by way of a 
threaded connection (6a, 13d, 33e, 14b). 
A spectacle holder according to claim 2, 
characterized in that means (13, 15, 16, 17, 18) for 

turning the adjusting screw (13d) are arranged behind 
the pressure plate (10, 34, 120). 
A spectacle holder according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the distance 

between the rear wall (2, 30a, 110a) and the pressure 
plate (10, 34, 120) is adjustable by means of a friction 

brake (20a, 20b). 
A spectacle holder according to claim 4, 
characterized in that the friction brake (20a, 20b) can 

be released by way of a push-button (21) arranged on a 
side of the pressure plate (10) remote from the rear 

wall (2, 30a, 110a) to adjust the pressure plate (10). 
A spectacle holder according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the opening 

travel of the pressure plate (10, 34, 120) is limited 
by a stop member (12). 
A spectacle holder according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the pressure 

plate (10, 34, 120) is made from a resilient material. 
A spectacle holder according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a centring 

means (5a, 10a, 33c, 34c) which engages in the nose 
space (100a) of an inserted pair of spectacles (7, 100,  

 
150) and centres these laterally is arranged between 

the rear wall (2, 30a, 110a) and the pressure plate 
(10, 34, 120). 
A spectacle holder according to claim 8, 
characterized in that respective parts of the centring 

means (5a, 10a, 33c, 34c) are arranged on the rear wall 
(2, 30a, 110a) and on the pressure plate (10, 34, 120)
