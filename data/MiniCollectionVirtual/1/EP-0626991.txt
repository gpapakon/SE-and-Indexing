<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes
for converting hydrocarbonaceous oils containing recycled polynaphthenic components to
products of an average lower molecular weight and an average
lower boiling point.Of the many hydroconversion processes known in the art,
hydrocracking is becoming increasingly important since it
offers product flexibility together with product quality.
Because it is also possible to subject rather heavy
feedstocks to hydrocracking, it will be clear that much
attention has been devoted to the development of
hydrocracking catalysts.In prior disclosures it was not appreciated how to reduce or
eliminate the detrimental effects polynuclear aromatics
presented to hydroprocessing. Since polynuclear aromatics
(PNAs) are somewhat insoluble, their accumulation results in
the fouling of process equipment, such as heat exchangers
and process lines, and severely impacts upon the
hydrocracking catalyst performance. These PNAs also
contribute to shortened catalyst life and contribute to
higher hydroprocessing temperatures. In the past, to reduce the amount of PNAs in the feed stream
a recycle bleed was utilized. This reduced the PNA
concentration in the feed to the hydrocracking process but
the practice also resulted in products of value being
removed, contributing to process inefficiencies.Modern hydrocracking catalysts are generally based on
zeolitic materials which may have been adapted by techniques
like ammonium ion exchange and various forms of calcination
in order to improve the performance of the hydrocracking
catalysts based on such zeolites.One of the zeolites which is considered to be a good
starting material for the manufacture of hydrocracking
catalysts is the well-known synthetic zeolite Y as described
in U.S. Pat. No. 3,130,007 issued April 21, 1964. A number
of modifications have been reported for this material, one
of which is ultrastable Y zeolite as described in U.S. Pat.
No. 3,536,605 issued October 27, 1970.To further enhance the utility of synthetic Y zeolite and
depending upon the hydroprocessing problem sought to be
solved, additional components have been added by means known
in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 3,835,027 issued to Ward et al.
on September 10, 1974,
describes a catalyst containing at
least one amorphous refractory oxide, a crystalline zeolitic
aluminosilicate and a hydrogenation component selected from
the Group VI and VIII metals and their sulfides and oxides.
Ward et al. teach that the added materials enhance the
catalytic and denitrogenation activity of the
