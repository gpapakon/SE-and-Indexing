<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber array having an optical coupling end where another optical path is coupled to it. On this 
optical coupling end, ends of plural optical fibers are arranged. This optical fiber array comprises a lower plate (3a) 

where a plurality of V grooves are formed to position the optical fibers exposed at the end of the core, and an upper 
plate (3b) which presses the optical fibers (1) arranged in the grooves (4) in the lower plate (3b) against the V grooves 

(4). The boundary parts of the cores (7) and optical fibers (1) are fixed by a heat-resistant bonding agent (10) between 
the upper and lower plates (3a and 3b). Further, the optical fibers (1) from this boundary parts are airtightly fixed by 

solder (6). In this way, it is possible to implement a high hermetic seal having a sufficient airtightness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber
array which optically couples with an LD (laser diode)
array or a PD (photodiode) array which are used in optical
parallel transmissions. Furthermore, the invention refers to
a method of manufacturing an optical fiber array.In recent years, there are proposed optical
interconnecting methods, in which a plurality of optical
fiber lines are used to connect between apparatus such as
large computers or mass-storage information exchange
systems. The basic method of the optical interconnecting
is, as shown in Fig. 1, connecting between apparatus 701
and 702 using an optical fiber line 703 which is made of a
plurality of optical fibers and transmitting optical
signals in parallel. A part of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 2.
An optical module 704 for parallel transmission in the 
apparatus 701 and an optical module 705 for parallel
transmission in the apparatus 702 are connected each
other through multifiber optical connectors 706 and
optical fiber lines 703.As the multifiber optical connector 706, for
example, there is an optical fiber array having a
structure which optical fibers are held by V-shaped
grooves formed by etching silicon (hereinafter simply
called Si), (Journal of Lightwave Technology Vol. Lt-3
No. 5, p.1159, issued in October, 1985). Further, there
is an optical fiber array having a structure which
optical fibers are put between two L-shaped magnets,
which array is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No.
4-86802 (86802/1992) has been known.However, the aligned optical fiber array with an LD
array or a PD array is fixed by using solder bonding or a
YAG laser, its heat is also transferred to the optical
fiber array, which heats up the optical fiber array to 200
Â°C or above. Consequently, the problems of distortion
appearing in micro order depending on the state of
assembly, degrade of the coupling part, gas generation
from adhesive around the optical fiber array, degrade of
characteristics due to dew, and others arise.As shown in Fig. 3, in the optical module 704, a
fiber ribbon 703a is continuously formed and the
multifiber optical connector 706 is placed at one end of 
the fiber ribbon 703a, which is what is called a pigtail
type. It is also known that the fiber ribbon 703a and the
multifiber optical connector 706 are placed at both ends
of a silica waveguide 707 (e.g., an optical branching
filter, an optical multiplexer, or an optical switch),
which is what is called a jumper type.However, the parallel optical transmission module,
especially the
