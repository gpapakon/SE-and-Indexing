<ABSTRACT>
A high purity synthetic diamond with very few 
impurities and crystal defects and low internal 

strains is provided, in which the nitrogen content is 
at most 10 ppm, preferably at the most 0.1 ppm, and 

the boron content is at the most 1 ppm, preferably at 
the most 0.1 ppm, or in which nitrogen atoms and 

boron atoms are contained in the crystal and the 
difference between the number of the nitrogen atoms 

and that of the boron atoms is at the most 1 x 10¹⁷ 
atoms/cm³. The strain-free synthetic diamond is 

produced by a process based on the temperature 
gradient method, which comprises using a carbon 

source having a boron content of at the most 10 ppm 
and a solvent metal having a boron content of at the 

most 1 ppm and adding a nitrogen getter to the 
solvent metal. 
The synthetic diamond can also be produced by a process based on the 
temperature gradient method, which comprises controlling the amount of a 

nitrogen getter added to a solvent metal and/or controlling the amount 
of boron added to a carbon source and/or a solvent metal so that the 

number of nigrogen atoms incorporated into the crystal is substantially 
the same as the number of boron atoms incorporated into the crystal 

during synthesis. 
Methods of measuring the strain in a synthetic 
diamond are based on the double or quadruple crystal method or on Raman 

spectroscopic analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a colourless,
transparent, high purity and good crystallinity
synthetic diamond, substantially free from
impurities, crystal defects, strains, etc., and a
process for the production of the same and also a
method for measuring the strain in diamond.Diamond crystals can be applied to various uses
such as heat sinks, dies for wire drawing, cutting
tools for precision working, optical parts, laser
windows, and anvils for producing ultra-high
pressures, because of their high hardness and
strength, excellent thermal conductivity and
corrosion resistance and good transmittance of light.Naturally occurring diamonds, most of which are
called Ia type, contain about 1000 ppm of nitrogen.
The nitrogen in this natural diamond is distributed
in the crystal in an aggregated form, resulting in a
significant number of crystal defects and high
internal strains. Additionally, there is absorption
of light in the infrared range due to the presence of
the nitrogen. Depending upon the variety of a rough
stone, there is a large dispersion. Consequently,
the applied use has been limited to heat sinks or
tools. High purity natural diamond containing
nitrogen impurities in an amount of at the most
several ppm is called IIa type and such diamond
constitutes an output of only about 2 % based on all
rough stones. Since the natural diamond of IIa type
contains a very small amount of impurities, is
colorless and transparent and has superior
transmittance properties, it has widely been applied
to jewelery, optical parts and laser window materials. However, defects and strains still remain to a
considerable extent in the interior part of the
natural diamond because of the complicated growth
processes which have occured in the interior part of
the earth. With regard to the lattice strain,
natural diamond suffers to a greater extent than
synthetic diamonds containing nitrogen. Furthermore,
natural diamond of IIa type suffers to such an extent
from strains in the lattice, that the output quantity
is small, resulting in high production costs.An ordinary diamond artificially synthesized
under ultra-high pressure and high temperature is
called type Ib and contains several hundreds ppm of
nitrogen. Since the nitrogen is contained in the
diamond crystal as an isolated substitutional
impurity, the crystal is rendered yellow and is
therefore less valuable as a jewel. In addition, the
concentration of nitrogen in the diamond varies
depending on the growth sectors and the nitrogen
distribution is therefore largely uneven
