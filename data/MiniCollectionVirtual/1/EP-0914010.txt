<ABSTRACT>
A clock signal generation apparatus includes a first device for
extracting reference information from an input digital signal. An

oscillator operates for generating a reference clock signal having a
frequency depending on a control signal. A second device

connected to the first device and the oscillator operates for
generating the control signal to the oscillator in response to the

reference clock signal generated by the oscillator and the reference
information extracted by the first device, and for locking a phase of

the reference clock signal to the reference information. A third
device connected to the second device operates for deciding

whether or not the phase of the reference clock signal is
successfully locked to the reference information. A fourth device

connected to the second device, a memory, and the third device
operates for storing the control signal generated by the second

device into the memory when the third device decides that the
phase of the reference clock signal is successfully locked to the

reference information. A fifth device connected to the memory, the
oscillator, and the second device operates for selecting one of the

control signal currently generated by the second device and the
control signal stored in the memory, and for feeding the selected

control signal to the oscillator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for generating a
reference clock signal from reference information in a bit stream
transmitted as, for example, a sequence of MPEG2 transport
packets used by digital broadcasting.In digital broadcasting, video and audio signals related to a
plurality of programs are transmitted as a bit stream on a
multiplexed basis. A receiver side for digital broadcasting is
required to generate a reference clock signal which serves as a
system clock signal.It is known that a transmitter side for digital broadcasting
generates reference information designed to enable a receiver side
to generate a system clock signal, and periodically inserts the
reference information into a bit stream to be transmitted. In this
case, a receiver side detects the reference information in a received
bit stream, and generates a system clock signal from the detected
reference information. Specifically, the receiver side includes a
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and a phase locked loop circuit
(a PLL circuit). The PLL circuit phase-locks the oscillator to the
detected reference signal, thereby generating a system clock signal
from the detected reference signal.In general, there are variations in characteristic among PLL 
circuits. Accordingly, the above-mentioned known clock generating
system requires an adjustment of an offset in a control voltage
applied to the voltage-controlled oscillator. The offset adjustment
increases the manufacture cost of the receiver side.It is an object of this invention to provide a clock signal
generation apparatus which dispenses with an offset adjustment.A first aspect of this invention provides a clock signal
generation apparatus comprising first means for extracting
reference information from an input digital signal; an oscillator for
generating a reference clock signal having a frequency depending
on a control signal; second means connected to the first means and
the oscillator for generating the control signal to the oscillator in
response to the reference clock signal generated by the oscillator
and the reference information extracted by the first means, and for
locking a phase of the reference clock signal to the reference
information; a memory; third means connected to the second
means for deciding whether or not the phase of the reference clock
signal is successfully locked to the reference information; fourth
means connected to the second means, the memory, and the third
means for storing the control signal generated by the second means
into the memory
