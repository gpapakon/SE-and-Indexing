<ABSTRACT>
A cast cylinder head of light metal incorporates a 
reinforcement made of a stronger material than the light metal. 

The reinforcement consists of a relatively narrow elongated 
steel plate (6) which stretches in a single piece along all the 

cylinders. The elongated steel plate (6) is provided with 
transverse arms (8) which stretch out approximately 

perpendicularly from the steel plate between the valve port 
apertures (3a, 4a, 5a, 6a) of each cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reinforced cylinder head which is
for a combustion engine and which is cast in a light metal
alloy such as aluminium and aluminium alloys.Development work is continually going on within the vehicle
industry with a view to improving the ratio between the power
output and weight of vehicle engines. This endeavour has
resulted inter alia in improvements with regard to the
geometrical design of combustion chambers, ignition control and
further development of the fuel supply and exhaust gas systems.
The majority of today's combustion engines thus incorporate
several inlet and exhaust gas ports per engine cylinder; there
are normally four ports comprising two inlet ports and two
exhaust gas ports for each cylinder. These ports are usually
arranged symmetrically in a four-leaf clover pattern about the
central axis of each cylinder.In parallel with the endeavour to increase engine power output,
there has been an endeavour to reduce engine weight. The
weight decrease which has been achieved and which has led to
light combustion engines has primarily arisen because it has
been possible for new casting material consisting of high-quality
light metal alloys to be used for making engine
castings. The weight reduction is offset, however, by the fact
that the endeavour to increase engine power output involves,
for example, a larger number of valve ports and mechanical
weakening of the cylinder head. There is therefore an
interdependence between the two endeavours. Increasing the
engine power output requires better strength characteristics in
the material used, which tends to conflict with the desire to
reduce engine weight.Modern high-quality light metal alloys have a substantial
disadvantage in that they are considerably more expensive than
traditional materials, thereby increasing engine production 
costs.In combustion engines the greatest material stresses occur
around the cylinders, since it is precisely in this area that
the thermal and mechanical load gradients are greatest. In
multi-valve engines the strength problem is further exacerbated
by the fact that the ports have of necessity to be located
here, which reduces the volume of material available for power
absorption and heat dissipation in the most exposed area.The object of the invention is to indicate a solution which
results in better utilisation of material from the strength
point of view, so that the light metal material is relieved of
stress in the most exposed areas, so that the same engine power
output can be extracted
