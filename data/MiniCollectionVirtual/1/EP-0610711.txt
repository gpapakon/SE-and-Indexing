<ABSTRACT>
An electronic control device for an electric motor drive, especially a drive for a garage door, is proposed, which is provided with a central control unit (10) controlling an electric motor (12). Switch-off and/or control signals from devices monitoring the drive are fed to this control unit (10). A self-test device consists of a signal generator stage (17) simulating switch-off and/or control signals, a test device (15) checking the reaction associated with these switch-off and/or control signals in the central control unit (10), and a switch-off device blocking the electric motor (12) on the occurrence of at least one faulty reaction or of one fault signal. By means of the simulation of switch-off and/or control signals, faulty functioning can be detected before switching on the electric motor (12) and unchecked and dangerous movements can be prevented by this means.

<CLAIMS>
Electronic control device for an electromotive
drive, in particular garage door drive, having a central

control unit (10, 14, 15), which controls an electric
motor (12) and to which deactivation signals and/or

control signals are fed by devices (16) which monitor the
drive, characterized by a self-test device, which can be

activated by activation signals for the electric motor
(12) before it is actuated, having a signal generator

stage (17), which simulates deactivation and/or control
signals, a test device (15) which checks, in the central

control unit, the reaction associated with these
deactivation and/or control signals, and a deactivation

device, which blocks the electric motor (12) when at
least one incorrect reaction or an error signal occurs.
Control device according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the test device (15) has means for checking

the idle-state signals, present at the deactivation
signal and/or control signal inputs (13), before and/or

after the generation of the simulated deactivation
signals and/or control signals.
Control device according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the self-test device has three test phases,

the first test phase being provided for checking the
idle-state signals before the generation of the simulated

signals, the second test phase being provided for checking
the reaction to the simulated signals and the third

test phase being provided for checking the idle-state
signals after the simulated signals have been deactivated

again. 
Control device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that the test device (15) for checking the

reaction to the simulated signals and/or control signals
has a time-window monitoring device, and in that means

are provided for generating an error signal when the
reactions to the simulated signals and/or the restored

idle-state signals do not occur within a time window.
Control device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the signal generator stage

(17) can be activated and deactivated by means of test
signals of the central control unit (10).
Control device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the test device (15) is a

component of the central control unit (10).
Control device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the central control unit

(10) is designed as a microcomputer.
Control device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a visual and/or acoustic

warning device (18) which is coupled to the deactivation
device is provided for displaying a malfunction.
Control device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that an input-signal adaptation

stage (14) for the deactivation signals and/or control
signals is connected upstream of the central control

unit (10).
