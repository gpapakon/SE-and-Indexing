<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of types of format data items are 
stored in a format storage section (8) according to the 

width of label tape and the number of lines of print 
data. A tape width sensing section (7) senses the 

width of label tape. A control section (1) senses the 
number of lines of print data. The control section (1) 

reads from the format storage section (8) a plurality 
of formats corresponding to the sensed label tape width 

and the number of lines of print data sensed, and 
displays them on a display section (4). The user 

selects a suitable one from the plurality of formats 
displayed. The control section (1) causes a printing 

section (6) to print the entered data on the label tape 
according to the selected format.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a label printer as set forth in the preamble of claim 1. A label
printer of this kind is known from EP-A-0497352.The aforementioned document describes a tape printer unit wherein when input
means inputs alphanumeric data to be printed and a character-size code of the
alphanumeric data together with a line-feed code, it is determined based on the
number of lines of the input alphanumeric data and the maximum character size of
each line whether or not the alphanumeric data can be printed on a tape attached to a
printer, and when it is determined that the print is enabled, the input alphanumeric
data is printed on the tape.GB-A-2120821 discloses a label printer adapted for record different label formats and
printing labels having variable information in a selected on of said formats, wherein a
label format may be entered into a memory by a supervisor on entry of a password
and thereafter prompts for the several fields of a label in that format are displayed line
by line on a display. Variable information within the selected format is entered by the
operator in response to the prompts using a built-in keyboard.From UA-A-4,827,358 an apparatus for recording data in suitable format depending
on the size of the recording material is known comprising a plurality of pattern
generators to generate plural different patterns for each character code, so that one of
the patterns may be selected according to the size of the recording sheet.With the label printer, it is possible to create various types of labels, such as labels
for document files, video tapes, and audio cassette tapes. However, when the
width of label tape changes, the number of printable lines of data, character size in
each line, etc., change accordingly, 
which makes the format setting complicated and
troublesome. Therefore, although the user has set the
formats, good print results cannot be obtained because
of a badly-balanced arrangement of print data items on
the label tape, or printing cannot be done because the
print data items are larger than the label tape, unless
the number of printable lines and the character size
are appropriate for the label tape width.Accordingly, for proper printing, the user must
set formats, taking into account the label tape width,
the number of lines of print data, and the character
size.Furthermore, with the conventional label printer,
the key-entered character data or the image data read
from an image reader first appears on the display
section, such as a liquid-crystal display. To

<CLAIMS>
A label printer comprising:

a label printer body (12);
a plurality of label tapes (20) having different widths and received in a plurality
of tape cartridges (22) of various types which are selectively attachable to said label printer body

(12);
tape width sensing means (7) for detecting the width of said label tape (20) on
the basis of said cartridge (22) attached to said label printer body (12);
input means (2) for inputting print data including a plurality of lines of
characters;
number-of-lines detecting means (1, step P1) for detecting the number of lines
of the print data input by said input means (2);
display means (4) for displaying the print data input by said input means (2)
and selection menus; and
print means (6) for printing the print data input by said input means (2) onto
said label tape;

   
characterized by
format storage means (8) for storing as format data a plurality of kinds of
different combinations of character lines different in print size

in correspondence with the different widths of label tapes (20) and
the number of lines to be printed on the label tape (20);
determining means (1, step P6) for determining whether or not the format data
corresponding to the width of the label tape detected by said tape width sensing

means (7) and the number-of-lines of the print data detected by said number-of-lines
detecting means (1, step P1) is previously stored in said format storage means (8);
display control means (1, 3, steps P5, P7) for allowing automatically a format
selection screen representing the plurality of format data to display on said display

means when said determining means (1, step P6) determines that the format data
corresponding to the width of the label tape detected by said tape width sensing

means (7) and the number-of-lines of the print data detected by said number-of-lines
detecting means is stored in said format storage means (8), and for allowing a non-storage

state to display on said display means when said determining means (1, step
p6) determines that the format data corresponding to the width of the label tape

detected by said tape width sensing means (7) and the number-of-lines of the print
data detected by said number-of-lines detecting means is not stored in said format

storage means (8);
format selecting means (1, 2b-2f) for manually selecting one format data from
the plural format data on the basis of the format selection screen displayed on said

display means by said display control means (1, 3, step P7); and
