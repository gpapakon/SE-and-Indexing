<DESCRIPTION>
According to the conceived model, an original object carrying 
case is created for use on the inside of motor vehicles. 
It is formed by two parts, foldable facing each other and 
usable to cover normal sun visors located on the inside 
of the windshield. Depending on if the sun visors are fixed and therefore 
only manoeuvred frontally, of if they are unhookable for 
a rotation of approximately 90Â°, the conceived case is 
applied from underneath or above, "straddling" the sun 
visor. A main feature of this case is the fact that it can be 
put in place and taken off based upon necessity of the 
sun visor and that its fastening can be made by "velcro" 
type strip tape, traditional straps, adjustable elastics, 
buttons or other. This case can also be used attaching it to the owner's 
belt by simply doubling it over on itself.  In the two attached drawings: 
Fig. 1 shows the conceived case frontally and open; Fig. 2 represents the opposite side; Fig. 3 shows the case as applied to the sun visor in a 
raised position; Fig. 4 represents the sun visor in a lowered position; Fig. 5 shows the case as applied to the owner's belt. In the detail, as shown by Figures 1 and 2, the conceived 
case is internally composed of a certain number of pockets, 
also supplied with zippers. For example, case a consists of the following: pocket b 
for a comb; pockets c and d as document holder or money 
holder; seat e and f to contain pens and pencils. The other half of the case can include a "slide space" to 
hold eye glasses or sunglasses. Fig. 2 represents the reverse side of the case when open. 
It has a zip pocket g for holding change or documents and 
a loop h for the belt to which the case can be attached 
and carried by the owner. In this case, the object carrier 
is closed by the outside zipper i (Fig. 1) before being 
attached to a pants belt or a belt to be worn around the 
waist. The zipper (Fig. 1) divides a big internal pocket in half  
 
in which one can place change, pay toll tickets or other. The case is applied by "straddling" it across a sun visor 
as indicated in Fig. 3 (Table II) in one way or another 
according to the user's preference. In the figure example, with the sun visor raised (arrow 
x), the case offers eye glasses. Meanwhile, with the sun 
visor lowered (Fig. 4 arrow y) all of the other objects listed 
above are accessible. Fig. 5 shows how the case, closed on itself using the outer 
zipper i, can be carried at the waist using a belt. Application of the case on the sun visor can be made even 
if it
