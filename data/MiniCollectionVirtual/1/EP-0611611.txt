<ABSTRACT>
Electrical apparatus for bending tubes (pipes), of the type of those using a transmission system consisting of a reducing-gear electric motor (gear motor) actuating, as the rotation element, a shaped shoe (block) or last, being characterised in that it is coaxial with the revolution element over which has been placed an end-of-travel cap with stationary limit-stop means which are angularly arranged so as to form a stop mechanism, during its rotation, with a peg (pin) of a rod sliding on the rotor (armature) of the apparatus which drives, by means of its movement, the displacement of the working control member (7) of the transmission system.

An electrical apparatus for bending pipes using a 
transmission system consisting of an electric gear motor 

which powers a turning device (5) constituted by a shaping 
tree or patten, the said apparatus comprising a limiter hood 

(8; 8') mounted coaxially with the turning device (5) and 
carrying fixed means of stopping (10, 11, 11', 10
1
, 10
2
, 11
1
, 
11
2
) arranged angularly in two ending positions 

in order to form a stop to the rotation of the turning 
device (5) by a check, and means of allowing the rotation of 

the turning device (5) to be stopped when it reaches its 
final position, characterized in that it carries means of 

stopping (25; X) which can be fixed in specific angular 
positions on the run limit hood (8; 8') which is connected 

to the turning device (5) in order to form a stop to the 
rotation of the turning device (5), with the said check 

limiting the run of the turning device (5) to specific set 
angles, the said check being fixed to a peg (12) on a rod 

(13) mounted to slide on the framework of the apparatus, the 
said rod (13) provoking by its movement a shifting of the 

transmission system control lever (17). 
An electrical apparatus in accordance with claim 1 
characterized in that the said fixable means of stopping 

are represented by a disc (X) with a radial spline (l) of 
which the radius (m
1
) is similar to the radius (m
2
) of the 
hood (8'), the disc (X) being coaxial with and able to be  

 
set on the hood in an angular position (8'). 
An electrical apparatus according to claim 2 characterized 
in that the hood (8') has a groove (r) in which a screw (t) 

for tightening the disc (X) to the hood (8') can slide. 
An electrical apparatus according to claim 1 characterized 
in that the fixable means of stopping are constituted by 

stop pegs (25) which can be fixed to the run limit hood (8) 
and are detachable.
