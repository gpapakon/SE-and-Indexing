<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for detecting or 
quantitating each of at least two analytes or an analyte(s) and 
an internal reference material or a control material in a test 
sample using at least two different luminescent labelled 
conjugates. The luminescent conjugates are characterized in that 
they are activated to emit light by at least two different 
reaction mechanisms. The invention also provides for test kits 
containing at least two different luminescent labelled conjugates 
for detecting or quantitating at least two analytes or an 
analyte(s) and an internal reference material or a control 
material in a test sample. The detection or quantitation of an analyte in a wide 
variety of test samples, is provided by assay techniques which 
rely upon the formation of a complex between the analyte and a 
corresponding complementary reagent or binding partner. Reagent 
or binding partner pairing or annealing of an analyte is an 
integral part of immunoassays, protein-binding assays, nucleic 
acid hybridization assays, and amplification assays. In typical 
immunoassays, the analyte may be either an antigen or an antibody 
and the corresponding binding partner generally is an antibody 
or antigen, respectively. Various alternate immunoassay or 
hybridization and amplification techniques and formats thereof 
are well known in the art. The test sample containing or suspected of containing the 
analyte sought to be detected or quantitated may be derived from 
an industrial or a biological source and may be liquid, e.g., 
blood or urine, or solid, e.g., tissue biopsy or feces. Control 
or reference samples are also tested to provide a standard curve 
to convert the detected amount of the analyte into a quantitated  
 
value and for calibration of the instrument. Assays of the above-stated types have also been used to 
analyze a wide variety of analytes in test samples in 
epidemiological and environmental disciplines. In the food 
industry, for example, such assays have been used to detect 
toxins and bacterial contamination. Immunoassays and protein-binding assays may be used to 
detect or quantitate protein or peptide analytes, therapeutic 
drugs, and other substances; while nucleic acid hybridization 
methods may be used to determine the presence or absence of 
nucleic acid analytes. Like immunoassays, hybridization assays 
also rely upon the formation of a complex between an analyte and 
a complementary binding substance. The analyte or target in a 
hybridization assay is a DNA or RNA
