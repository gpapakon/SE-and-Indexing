<ABSTRACT>
A resilient annular transition collar (16) is provided for roadway structures (10), including manholes (12) and catch basins, which acts as a flexible transition between the rigid structure or frame of the manhole (12) and the semi-rigid structure of the asphalt paving (10). The resilient transition collar (16) absorbs any movement of the pavement during expansion and contraction and this absorption avoids the prior art problems of break-up, cracking and separation between manhole and pavement. Risers or adjusting rings may be employed in conjunction with the transition collar to ensure a flush fit between the pavement (18) surface and the upper surface of the transition collar (16). A mold structure (50) for forming the collars includes heat transfer studs (62) to provide an increased production rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TRANSITION COLLARFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel structure which functions as a transition collar for catch basins and manholes.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION At the present time, asphalt paving material generally surrounds manholes and catch basins. However, optimum compaction of the asphalt adjacent the periphery of the manhole or catch basin leads to deterioration of the asphalt in use. Expansion and contraction of the pavement occurs with varying temperature and leads to asphalt break-up, cracking and separation between pavement and manhole. Repairs typically are required at least every two to three years.A search of the prior art conducted in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has located the following United States patents as the most relevant prior art:3,263,580 4,808,0254,927,290 5,030,0304,759,656 4,925,3364,969,771 FR2303122 With respect to the prior art, U.S. Patents Nos. 5,030,030 and 4,925,336 contain the same disclosure. These references describe a pad which supports a utility access conduit in a roadway. The support pad comprises a rectangular block of rubber or similar compressibly resilient elastomeric material which has an opening through it to snugly engage the access conduit.U.S. Patent No. 3,263,580 discloses a safety cover for a manhole which overlies the manhole cover, sits flush with a roadway and is fastened to the manhole cover by bolts. The cover also surrounds the upper portion of the manhole structure at the periphery. 

 French Patent No. 2,030,122 describes a procedure for fixing the frame of a manhole cover in place. A ring-shaped rebate is formed surrounding the frame and a sealant comprising a hardenable resin material is passed into the rebate and hardened to provide the final structure.It will be apparent from the discussion below that none of this prior art discloses or suggests the structures which are described herein. SUMMARY OF INVENTIONIn accordance with the present invention, there is provided a novel structure which is intended to overcome these prior art problems. The present invention provides a resilient annular collar for the manhole or catch basin, which acts as a flexible transition between the rigid structure or frame of the manhole and the semiÂ¬ rigid structure of the asphalt paving. The present invention also provides an improved mold structure for the provision of such collars. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a roadway structure comprising a subterranean access opening in the roadway, a rigid

CLAIMS
1. A roadway structure comprising: a subterranean access opening in said roadway, a rigid frame structure surrounding said opening, a roadway pavement structure, and a resilient collar structure surrounding said rigid frame structure and spanning the distance therefrom to said roadway pavement structure.
2. The roadway structure of claim 1 wherein said resilient collar is formed from rubber scrap from automobile tyres.
3. The roadway structure of claim 1 wherein said resilient collar is of circular shape with a central opening to engage snugly said rigid frame structure and said roadway structure has a circular depression formed therein adjacent said subterranean opening into which said resilient collar is received.
4. The roadway structure of claim 3 wherein said circular depression is dimensioned such that the upper surface of said transition collar lies in substantially planar alignment with the upper surface of said roadway pavement structure.
5. The roadway structure of claim 3 wherein said the resilient collar is pre-molded to said rigid frame structure prior to positioning in the roadway depression.
6. The roadway structure of claim 3 wherein one or more adjusting rings is located in said depression in order to position the upper surface of said transition collar in substantially planar alignment with the upper surface of said roadway pavement structure.
7. The roadway structure of claim 6 wherein said adjusting rings comprise a set of three rings, two having a uniform thickness differing one from another and the other having a wedge-shape in side-elevation view, varying uniformly from a first thickness dimension at one side to a second thickness dimension at the other. 


8. The roadway structure of claim 1 wherein said subterranean access opening is a manhole opening and said rigid frame structure is constructed to support a rigid cover for the opening.
9. For use in a roadway construction, the combination of:
(a) an annular resiliently-flexible transition collar having a central opening formed therethrough for receiving a rigid frame structure of a roadway subterranean access opening therein, and
(b) a set of riser rings for adjusting the height and/or orientation of said transition collar in a roadway depression adjacent the subterranean access.
10. The combination of claim 9 wherein said set of risers includes first and second risers of different uniform thicknesses to effect height adjustment of said transition collar and a third riser of wedge shape in side-elevation, varying uniformly from a minimum dimension at one side thereof to a maximum dimension at the other side thereof.
11. The combination of claim 10 wherein said transition collar and set of riser rings are formed from scrap rubber from automobile tyres.
12. An injection mold for molding a resilient transition collar from rubber scrap from automobile tyres, comprising a mold cavity corresponding in shape to that of said collar into which rubber scrap is introduced to effect such molding, and defined by upper and lower mold- forming elements, one of said upper and lower mold- forming elements having heat-transfer studs protruding therefrom into said mold cavity.
13. The mold of claim 12 wherein said mold cavity is of annular shape and said heat transfer studs are arranged in a uniform array.
14. The mold of claim 13 wherein an inner wall of said mold cavity is defined by a rigid frame structure from a 


roadway subterranean access, whereby said transition collar is molded directly to said rigid frame structure.
