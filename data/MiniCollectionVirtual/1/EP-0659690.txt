<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water purification plant 
for purifying the fluid to be purified by means of 

flotation clarification, in which plant the pollutional 
particles or the impurities (14) dissolved in the fluid 

and brought into a particle form by means of 
flocculation chemicals are separated from the fluid 

to be purified and led onto the surface of the fluid 
into a slurry bed (15), which slurry bed (15) is led 

away into a sewer system (16, 17) or the like and 
the purified fluid is led via a clarification basin (11) 

and an intermediate bottom or the like located on its 
lower portion into a lower space (18) of the clarification 

basin (11) or directly away for additional 
purification or consumption, or when waste water is 

concerned, back to the environment. An intermediate 
bottom (20) of the clarification basin (11) is 

provided with elements (24, 25) affecting the flow, 
which elements form the flow resistance of the 

intermediate bottom (20) such that the flow resistance 
occurring through the intermediate bottom 

(20) is at its largest at the final end of the clarification 
basin (11) and the flow resistance decreases 

towards the initial end of the clarification basin 
(11), whereby the entire area of the clarification 

basin (11) has the same and uniform flow volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a water purification plant for purifying the fluid to be
purified by means of flotation clarification, in which plant the pollutional particles
or the impurities dissolved in the fluid and brought into a particle form by means of
flocculation chemicals are separated from the fluid to the purified and led onto the
surface of the fluid into a slurry bed, which slurry bed is led away into a sewer
system or the like and the purified fluid is led via a clarification basin and an
intermediate bottom or the like located on its lower part into a lower space of the
clarification basin or directly away for additional purification or consumption, or
when waste water is concerned, back to the environment.The flotation method has proved to be the best and most efficient water purification
method for chemically purifying lake, river and water as well as iron-bearing
and
polluted groundwaters. Similarly, it is the most efficient chemical purification
method for waste waters, especially when very difficult industrial waste waters and
preliminary and final purification of waste waters are concerned.When the purification of water or waste water is concerned, attention has always to
be paid to the fact that the constructions and basins are large and expensive, and
especially in a cold climate, attention has also to be paid to the fact that they have
to be protected by means of normal heatable house structures.In the Finnish patent application 841591 is described a method for purifying a fluid
to be purified by means of flotation clarification. In this known method, the
pollutional particles or the impurities dissolved in the fluid and brought into a
particle form by means of flocculation chemicals are separated from the fluid to be
purified and led onto the surface of the fluid as a slurry bed, which slurry bed is led
away into a sewer system or the like and the purified fluid is led via a bottom
portion of the clarification basin through the bottom in the clarification basin for 
consumption, or when waste water is concerned, back to the environment. In this
known method, the purified fluid is caused to flow down in the clarification basin
after a runoff channel within the area of the entire clarification basin, including the
basin region adjacent to the runoff channel, by means of an edge circulating the
clarification basin, whereby the purified fluid flows from below the edge and
whereby the flow of the purified fluid forms extremely uniform within the area of
the entire clarification basin,
