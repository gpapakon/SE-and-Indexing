<ABSTRACT>
A busbar package (busbar trunking) (10) preferably for supplying voltage to push-in assemblies in computer cabinets. The busbar package (10) consists of metallic busbars (12, 14, 16, 18) between which and on which layers of insulating material (20, 20a, 20b) are loosely laid. The busbar package (10) is held together by connecting elements (22, 24, 26) which are inserted into mutually aligned orifices (28) in the busbars (12, 14, 16, 18) and insulating material layers (20, 20a, 20b). The length of the connecting elements is adjustable. For the purpose of simple recycling, the connecting elements (22, 24, 26) can easily be released and the individual parts broken down into individual material groups.

<CLAIMS>
Busbar package having the following features 

the busbars (12, 14, 16, 18) are provided over the 
entire surface with layers (20, 20a, 20b) of insulating 

material, 
all the busbars (12, 14, 16, 18) and insulating 
material layers (20, 20a, 20b) are provided with apertures 

(28), the apertures all being aligned with one 
another, 
the busbar package (10) is held together by connecting 
elements (22, 24, 26) which comprise head parts (42a, 

42b), which rest on the outer sides (20a, 20b) of the 
busbar package (10), and a shaft (40), which is located 

in between, passes through the apertures (28) and whose 
length is adjustable, 
 
characterized
 
in that the insulating material layers (20, 20a, 20b) are 

placed loosely between or on the busbars (12, 14, 16, 
18), the connecting element (22, 24, 26) comprises two 

parts (30a, 30b) which can be latched to one another, the 
length of the shaft (40) being adjustable by means of a 

multiplicity of latching positions, and the connecting 
elements (22, 24, 26) ensuring the insulation between the 

busbars (12, 14, 16, 18). 
Busbar package according to Claim 1,
 
characterized
 
in that the connecting element (22, 24, 26) is made of 

electrically insulating, preferably thermoplastic, 
plastic. 
Busbar package according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
  
 

characterized
 
in that the connecting elements (22, 24, 26) are designed 

in such a manner that they can be fitted and removed 
again without any tools. 
Busbar package according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized
 
in that the apertures (28) have a diameter which is 

larger by a small amount, preferably by about 1 mm, than 
the shaft (40) of the connecting element. 
Busbar package according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized
 
in that the insulating material layers (20, 20a, 20b) are 

made from a rigid material. 
Busbar package according to Claim 5,
 
characterized
 
in that the insulating material layers (20, 20a, 20b) 

project by a small amount, preferably by about 2.5 mm, 
beyond the edges of the busbars (12, 14, 16, 18).
