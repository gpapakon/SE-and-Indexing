<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to novel T-cell epitopes of bacterial products. The epitopes of the invention may be employed in the preparation of conjugates between the epitopes and medically useful antigens, haptens, or antigenic determinants. These conjugates are capable of eliciting antibody responses similar to conjugates of antigens covalently coupled to carrier proteins, and in a vaccine composition, provide a safe and more economic conjugate vaccines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part application 
of U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 
07/150,688, filed February 1, 1988. The present invention relates to vaccine compositions 
comprising an antigen, an antigenic determinant or 
hapten, conjugated to a carrier molecule. More specifically, 
the formulations comprise an antigen, antigenic 
determinant or hapten conjugated to a T-cell epitope of a 
bacterial product. The present compositions are capable 
of effectively inducing the production of protective 
antibodies against the immunogens employed, while at the 
same time avoiding the use of larger protein carrier 
molecules. The production of a protective immune response 
against any given infectious agent in vertebrates depends 
initially on the provision of the appropriate stimulus to 
the host's immune system. The infectious organism itself 
typically provides numerous immune-stimulatory compounds, 
or antigens, by the very nature of its cell membrane 
compositions, or by the metabolic products it releases in 
the host's body. These substances, usually larger 
molecules, such as proteins, lipopolysaccharides or  
 
glycoprotein, are recognized by the immune system as 
foreign, and provoke one or more different types of 
reaction from the host in an effort to remove or disable 
the invading organism. The antigen may stimulate sensitized 
lymphocytes (T-cells) which provide cell mediated 
immunity. Alternatively, an antigen may also stimulate 
B-lymphocytes to initiate the synthesis and secretion of 
free antibody into the blood and other bodily fluids 
(humoral immunity) and can operate with B-lymphocytes. 
The development of the body's protective immune response 
depends upon achieving a threshold level of stimulation 
of one or both of these systems, i.e., the activation of 
B-cells with cooperation from activated T-cells (see 
infra). Temporary immunity against infection can often 
be provided by giving an individual preformed antibodies 
from another individual of the same or different species; 
this is known as passive immunity. An example of such 
immunity is the protection afforded to a fetus or newborn 
by placental transfer of maternal antibodies as well as 
transfer through milk. Another example is the pooled 
adult gamma globulin that can be used to prevent or 
modify the effects of exposure to measles, chicken pox, 
hepatitis, smallpox and tetanus. These acquired antibodies 
are eventually utilized by interaction with the 
antigens or catabolized by the body, and thus the
