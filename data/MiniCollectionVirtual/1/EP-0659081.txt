<ABSTRACT>
A self-adhesive plaster for the transdermal application of steroid hormones with a backing impermeable to active agents, an adhesive layer containing the active agent and a protective layer removable before the application of the plaster to the skin, in which the active agent-containing adhesive layer contains a hot-melt adhesive with a processing temperature of between 60 and 100  C and dexpanthenol in a concentation of 15 to 25 wt.%.

<CLAIMS>
Self-adhesive plaster for the transdermal application
of systemically active steroid hormones, comprising an

active substance-impermeable backing layer, an active substance-containing
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer and a

removable protective layer covering said adhesive layer
prior to application to the skin, characterized in that the

active substance-containing pressure-sensitive adhesive
layer contains a pressure-sensitive hot melt adhesive

which contains as polymer an ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer
having a vinyl acetate content of 20 to 35% and which

has a processing temperature of between 60 and 100 °C,
and dexpanthenol at a concentration of 15 to 25%-wt.
Plaster according to claim 1, characterized in that the
steroid hormone is estradiol.
Plaster according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the pressure-sensitive hot

melt adhesive contains as auxiliary substances flexible
resins, hardened resins, fillers and ageing protecting

agents. 
Plaster according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the pressure-sensitive hot melt adhesive

is composed of the following components:

10 to 30%-wt. ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer
having a vinyl acetate content of 28%
15 to 45%-wt. flexible resin having a melt viscosity
of below 10 Pa·s at 60 °C.
10 to 30%-wt. aliphatic hydrocarbon resin having
a melt viscosity above 10 Pa·s at 100 °C
15 to 25%-wt. dexpanthenol
0.1 to 10%-wt. steroid hormone
0 to 5%-wt. filler
0 to 5%-wt. ageing protecting agent,

whereby the sum of the percentages of the components is
100.
Plaster according to one or more of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the pressure-sensitive hot melt adhesive

is present in one or more layers, whereby the
individual layers may be of different composition.
Plaster according to one or more of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that it comprises an active substance-impermeable,

flexible backing layer, an active substance
reservoir connected thereto which is formed of the pressure-sensitive

hot melt adhesive, and, where other controlling
mechanisms are not present, a membrane controlling the 

release of active substance, and optionally a pressure-sensitive
adhesive device connected to the membrane for fixing

the system to the skin, and a protective layer covering the
skin-facing adhesive surface of the plaster and being

detachable prior to application of the system.
Process for the production of the plaster according to
claims 1 to 6, characterized by the following process

steps:

a) resin portions of the formulation are melted at approx.
60 to 200 °C,
b) polymers are slowly stirred into the melt until a clear
melt is obtained,
c) subsequently or simultaneously, auxiliary substances
and/or fillers are slowly added while stirring, until a

homogeneous distribution is obtained (melt A),
d) in a separate stirring vessel dexpanthenol is melted at
50 °C and estradiol is slowly added in portions while

stirring, until a clear solution is obtained (melt B),
e) melt B is slowly stirred into melt A, until a homogeneous
mixture is obtained,
f) using a knife coating technique, the pressure-sensitive
hot melt adhesive is thereafter spread at 60 to 100 °C

onto a siliconised polyester protective layer (thickness
30 to 250 µm) such that a weight per area of 80 to

500 g/m
2
, preferably 150 to 280 g/m
2
, is obtained;
after cooling down, a backing layer of polyester

(thickness 6 to 100 µm) is laminated onto the pressure-sensitive
hot melt adhesive,
g) subsequently, patches having an area of 10 cm
2
 are
punched out.
