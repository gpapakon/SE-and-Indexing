<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to inhibiting leaching of crop treating chemicals into the ground water, aqua-system and surrounding soil of the treatment site by contacting the plant or plant site with an effective leach inhibiting, plant tolerating amount of (a) a copolymer of a maleic acid or ester or a mixture thereof and a comonomer of an alkyl alpha alkenyl ether; or (b) a protein or carbohydrate derived polymer containing pendant hydroxy and secondary, tertiary or quaternized amino groups; or (c) a copolymer having pendant optionally quaternized amino or pyrrolidone groups; or (d) a lactam containing polymer selected from the group of an optionally crosslinked N-alkenyl lactam homopolymer or copolymer with a C2 to C30 comonomer selected from the group of an alkenoic acid, an alkenyl-anhydride, ester, ether, amino ester or amino amide and an alpha mono- or di-olefin; optionally including a water based wetting agent of a higher alkyl substituted lactam, anionic surfactant and water to enhance the wetting properties of herbicide and pesticide formulations.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LEACHING INHIBITION OF CROP TREATINGCHEMICALS WITH POLYMERSAgrichemical contamination is a growing concern since more than 12 different pesticides have been found in the ground water. Studies have shown that pesticide residues in ground water are increasing and are particularly severe where agronomic and horticultural crops are grown in permeable sandy soils or in locations which receive heavy rainfall. Among the chemicals which are particularly troublesome are herbicides such as bromacil, atrazine, metribuzin, dicamba and metolachlor, nematicides such as aldicarb, fungicides such as triforine, pencanazole and bendiocarb and insecticides such as diazinone, chloropyrophor, and ethion, which have been found in drinking water. Hence, there is an acute need to restrict the downward movement of pesticides, herbicides, fungicides and other organic pollutants in the soil without reducing their agricultural efficacy.(a) There is provided a leach inhibiting, copolymer which is readily combined with an agrichemical or incorporated into an agrichemical formulation. The leach inhibiting copolymers of this invention are copolymers, preferably water insoluble copolymers having less than 10% water solubility, such as copolymers of maleic acid, a C-^ to C6 mono- or di- ester of said acid or a mixture thereof and a C2 to C25 comonomer of an alkyl alpha alkenyl ether or an alpha olefin, which copolymer has a molecular weight (Mw) of between about 8,000 and about 3,000,000. The structure of said copolymer is defined by the formula 
wherein X is C-L to C2$ alkyl, alkoxy, aryl, aryloxy; R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen or C-^ to C6 alkyl and n has a value of from 25 to 5000.Examples of suitable maleate esters include mono- and di- methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl and dimethylpropyl esters of maleic acid or mixtures thereof. The polymer may also contain mixtures of maleic acid and at least one of the ester derivatives as the monomeric portion of the polymer.Representative examples of the alkyl alpha-alkenyl ether comonomer include vinyl methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl propyl ether, vinyl isopropyl ether, vinyl pentyl ether, vinyl butyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether, vinyl t-butyl ether, vinyl hexyl ether, vinyl methylbutyl ethers, 2-ethenyl butyl ether, 2-ethenyl propyl ether, 2-ethenyl ethyl ether, 2-ethenyl hexyl ether, 2-ethenyl dodecyl ether, 2-ethenyl benzyl ether, vinyl ethylbutyl ethers and mixtures thereof.Illustrative of the comonomeric alpha olefins are ethene,
