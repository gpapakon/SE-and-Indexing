<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a thread wound golf ball wherein 
deterioration of performances due to bleeding of an oily 

substance contained in a solid rubber having a crosslinked 
structure as a center prevented. The thread wound 

golf ball comprises a solid center, a thread rubber layer 
provided on the outside of the solid center and a cover for 

covering the thread rubber layer, wherein solid center 
is composed of an inner rubber portion and an oil-resistant 

substance covering the inner rubber portion, and inner 
rubber portion has a crosslinked rubber structure and 

contain an oily substance, whereby bleeding of the oily 
substance is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thread wound
golf ball.A thread wound golf ball is obtained by winding
thread rubber on a solid or liquid rubber center to form a
thread rubber layer and coating the outside of the thread
rubber layer with a cover material (e.g. ionomer, balata,
etc.). As the solid rubber center, a vulcanized butadiene
rubber has been used in the prior art. This has a
considerably high hardness and small compression strain.
Golf balls with such a center have high spin and a low launch
angle resulting in disadvantageous flight distance. Further,
the golf ball sometimes turns too much when the ball is hit.On the other hand, a liquid center has a high
compression strain. Golf balls with such a liquid
center, have low spin and a high launch angle, resulting in
advantageous flight distance in comparison with golf balls
having a conventional solid center. However, the production
process of liquid centers is complicated and, further, liquid 
from liquid centers may splash out when the golf ball is cut
by a cutter, which may result in the loss of eyesight.The present inventors have found that, by using
solid rubber having a crosslinked structure containing an
oily substance as the center of the thread wound golf ball,
the spin is reduced and launch angle is increased
under proper initial velocity, thereby improving the
flight distance of the golf ball. This applies for both wood
and iron shots with good balance (Japanese Patent Application
No. 4-149304). However, the oily substance of the center has
been found to bleed over time and to penetrate into the thread
rubber layer, which results in deterioration of impact
resilience. Accordingly, performances of the golf ball could
not be maintained.GB-16,288 relates to a thread wound golf ball as
described in the preamble of claim 1.It has now been found that, by coating the outside of the solid
rubber center containing the oily substance with an oil-resistant
substance, bleeding can be prevented to maintain
performances of the golf ball.The main object of the present invention is to
provide a thread wound golf ball wherein deterioration of 
performance due to bleeding of the oily substance contained
in a solid rubber center having a crosslinked structure
is prevented.This object as well as other objects and
advantages of the present invention will become apparent to
those skilled in the art from the following description.The present invention provides a thread wound
golf ball comprising a solid center, a thread rubber layer
provided on the outside
