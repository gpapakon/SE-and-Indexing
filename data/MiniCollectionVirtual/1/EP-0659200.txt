This invention relates to a process for preparing poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate)/ionomer compositions which exhibit high impact strength and to articles made therefrom. The process involves melt blending poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) with an ionomer of ethylene, an unsaturated carboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid wherein the carboxylic acid groups are neutralized with zinc or sodium ions, and an alkyl acrylate, at a shear rate of 3500 to 7000 reciprocal seconds; and thermoforming the blend into an article.

 A PROCESS FOR PREPARING HIGH IMPACT STRENGTH POLY(1,4-CYCLOHEXYLENEDIMETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE)/IONOMER BLENDSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a process for preparing poly(1,4—cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate)/ionomer compositions which exhibit high impact strength and to articles made therefrom. The process involves melt blending poly(1,4—cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) (PCT) with an ionomer of ethylene, an unsaturated carboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid wherein the carboxylic acid groups are neutralized with zinc or sodium ions, and an alkyl acrylate, at a shear rate of 3500 to 7000 reciprocal seconds; and thermoforming the blend into an article.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Thermoplastic polyesters based on terephthalic acid and diols such as ethylene glycol and 1,4—cyclohexanedimethanol have proven to be very desirable for injection molding articles for high strength applications. Because many of such articles must withstand considerable temperature changes and/or physical abuse, it is customary to blend poly(1,4—cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) with other polymers to improve its impact resistance as shown by notched Izod impact values. There are advantages, however, in keeping PCT as the matrix material in PCT/polymer blends and those are to retain tensile strength, flexural modulus, elongation percent, weather resistance and heat deflection temperature.Thermoplastic compositions exhibiting high impact strength are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,435,093, 4,680,344, 4,172,859 and 4,753,980, and in PCT 

Application No. WO 92/03505. U.S. Pat. No. 3,435,093 discloses blends of polyethylene terephthalate and alpha—olefin/alpha—beta unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymers wherein the carboxylic acid groups are 0—100% neutralized by metal cations such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc and lead. Moreover, the polyethylene terephthalate is present in an amount of between 55 to 95 weight percent of the blend. Izod impact values of blends indicated in the Examples of U.S. Pat. No. 3,435,093 range from 27.8 J/m to 59.8 J/m at 23°C.U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,344 discloses blends containing a linear polyester and at least 60 weight percent of alpha—olefin/alpha—beta—ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid ionomer neutralized with zinc, calcium, or magnesium. No third comonomer is present. Izod impact values of blends indicated in the Examples of U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,344 range from 26.7 J/ϊn to 1308 J m at 23°C. U.S. Pat. No.
