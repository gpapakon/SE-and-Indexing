<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel polynucleotide sequence which encodes a novel
polypeptide belonging to the class of proteins known as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
The present invention also relates, inter alia, to processes for producing the polypeptide and its
uses.Cells and tissues respond to a wide variety of extracellular signalling molecules through the
interaction of these molecules with specific cell-surface receptors. One such class of receptors
are known as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and these are characterised by containing a
series of 7 hydrophobic transmembrane segments. Upon binding an extracellular ligand to its
receptor, intracellular signals are initiated via interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins
which, in turn, can lead to a number of different intracellular events depending upon which
receptor has been activated. For example some GPCRs influence adenyl cyclase activity
whereas others act via phospholipase C.Members of the GPCR superfamily respond to a wide variety of ligands including small
molecule amines (such as serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine), lipid-derived mediators (such as
LpA), amino acid derivatives (such as glutamate) and neurotransmitter peptides and hormones
(such as neurokinin, galanin, glucagon, gastrin). Although GPCRs are activated by a broad
range of ligands, it should be noted that individual GPCRs have a small and very specific
repertoire of ligands. Based upon an analysis of the primary structure of a novel GPCR, it is
now possible to classify them into specific sub-families, thereby narrowing the range of
potential ligands. In many cases, the endogenous ligands of GPCRs are relatively small, enabling them to be
mimicked or blocked by synthetic analogues. For example drugs such as prazosin, doxazosin,
cimetidine, ranitidine are all effective antagonists of their respective target GPCRs.Thus, as the modulation of GPCRs can have therapeutic consequences, there is a continued
need to provide new GPCRs and their associated agonists and antagonists.In a broad aspect, the present invention relates to novel amino acid sequences. In this regard, a
specific novel amino acid sequence has been isolated and it is to be understood that the
invention covers that sequence as well as novel variants, fragments, derivatives and homologues
thereof.In another broad aspect, the present invention relates to novel nucleic acid sequences. In this
regard, a specific novel nucleic acid sequence has been isolated and it is to be understood that
