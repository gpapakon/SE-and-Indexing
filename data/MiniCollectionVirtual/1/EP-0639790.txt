<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
surface-active compound, and more particularly to a
surface-active agent as a dispersant for hydrophobic
organic compounds that is excellent in dispersing ability,
emulsifying ability, and dispersion stability.The present invention relates also to a silver
halide photographic material having a dispersion of a
specific photographically useful substance in a specific
layer, and more particularly to a silver halide
photographic material having a hydrophilic colloid layer
containing a photographically useful substance that is
photochemically inactive during storage, namely that
hardly causes the occurrence of fluctuation of
photographic properties during storage, and that can
exhibit a required reactivity easily when it is
photographically processed.Silver halide photographic materials are formed
by introducing various photographically useful compounds
into hydrophilic colloid layers in order to allow various
photographic functions to be exhibited. In that case, in 
particular, with respect to multi-layer photographic
materials, water-insoluble substances are used to hold
intended photographically useful substances in particular
layers, to allow their functions to be exhibited. These
water-insoluble substances are oil-soluble substances in
many cases. The water-insoluble substance is formed into
fine emulsified particles by stirring it at a high speed,
with a dispersing solvent, a dispersing medium, and, if
required, a co-solvent (high-boiling organic solvent), in
the presence of a surface-active agent, in order to
introduce the water-insoluble substance into a hydrophilic
colloid layer of a photographic material, followed by
coating and drying.Obtaining a dispersion that is stable during
storage and during the coating step and the drying step is
required in order to avoid problems, such as nibs; and
obtaining or not obtaining finely dispersed grains,
influence the photographic properties greatly. For
example, it is known that, in dispersing dye-forming
couplers (hereinafter abbreviated to couplers), obtaining
a fine dispersion can improve reactivity and can attain a
high dye-forming efficiency; and, in dispersing a color-mix
inhibitor for use in an intermediate layer, obtaining
a fine dispersion can secure a high color-mix inhibition
activity. Further, in the case of nucleators, which are
water-insoluble photographically useful substances for
use, for example, in photographic materials for printing,
since the polarity of nucleators is subtle, there are few
preferable
