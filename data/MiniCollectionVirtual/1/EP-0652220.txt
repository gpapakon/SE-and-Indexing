<ABSTRACT>
A novel cephalosporin derivative represented by general formula (I), which has a potent antibacterial activity, a low toxicity 
and a high oral absorbability, and a nontoxic salt thereof, wherein R¹ and R³ represent each hydrogen or lower alkyl, and R² 

represents hydrogen or a group hydrolyzable in vivo. A drug containing this compound as the active ingredient has not only 
a potent antibacterial activity against various pathogenic bacteria including gram positive and negative bacteria but also an 

excellent oral absorbability and a low toxicity, thus being useful as an antibacterial for oral administration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
cephalosporin derivatives having a substituted thio 
group at the 3-position, and particularly to novel 
compounds of oral cephalosporin derivatives having 
potent antibacterial activity and the salts thereof. Antibiotics of cephalosporin series are very 
effective as the therapeutical agents of bacterially 
infectious diseases due to their superior antibacterial 
action and high safety. Especially, cephem derivatives 
having an aminothiazole group on the substituent of the 
amino group at the 7-position have been developed in 
recent years because of having potent antibacterial 
activity and wide antibacterial spectrum. The present inventors disclose some cephem 
derivatives having good oral absorbability in Japanese 
Patent Kokai 1-308289. Many antibiotics of cephalosporin series 
useful as drugs are known, and many of them are 
administered parenterally because of low oral 
absorbability. Of the oral cephalosporin drugs used  
 
clinically, cephalexin and cefachlor have a phenylglycylamino 
group at the 7-position and show high oral 
absorbability, but have extremely inferior antibacterial 
activity against gram-negative bacteria to injectional 
cephalosporin drugs. Oral cephalosporin drugs of which carboxylic 
acid at the 4-position is esterified in order to elevate 
the oral absorbability as so-called prodrug have been 
recently developed. These compounds have stronger antibacterial 
activity against gram-negative bacteria due to 
the introduction of an aminothiazolyl group at the 7-position 
than cephalexin, but remain the drawbacks of 
lowered antibacterial activity against gram-positive 
bacteria and the oral absorbability which is not so 
good. As a result of extensive researches for 
solving the above-mentioned problem, the present 
inventors have successed to synthesize novel 
cephalosporin derivatives having both strong 
antibacterial activity and high oral absorbability, and 
have accomplished the present invention. The present invention relates to cephalosporin 
derivatives represented by the formula: 
(wherein R¹ and R³ are each a hydrogen atom or a lower 
alkyl group, and R² is a hydrogen atom or an invivo 
hydrolyzable group) and non-toxic salts thereof. In the present invention, the invivo 
hydrolyzable group refers to one which is known in the 
prodrug techniques of the β-lactam drugs such as a 5-methyl-1,3-dioxacyclopent-4-en-2-on-4-ylmethyl 
group, an 
acetoxymethyl group, a pivaloyloxymethyl group, a 1-pivaloyloxyethyl 
group, a
