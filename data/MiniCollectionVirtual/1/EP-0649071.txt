<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing
apparatus for performing a development by use of a
developer composed of magnetic carriers and magnetic
toners as defined in the preamble of claim 1.An image forming apparatus such as a copying machine,
a printer, a facsimile equipment, etc. utilizes a latent
image forming type apparatus such as an
electrophotographic apparatus from a demand relative to
ordinary recording paper.In such an image forming apparatus, after forming an
electrostatic latent image on a photosensitive drum, the
electrostatic latent image on this photosensitive drum is
developed by a powdery developer and formed into a visible
image. Further, after transferring the powdery developed
image on the photosensitive drum onto a sheet, the sheet
is separated, and the powdery developed image on the sheet
is fixed thereto.A known method for this development is a so-called
1.5-component developing method involving the use of the
magnetic carriers and the magnetic toners. Based on this
developing method, a toner density control mechanism is
unnecessary, and the apparatus can be actualized with a 
simple construction. However, this developing method
requires a contrivance for making an image quality uniform
by controlling the toner density to a fixed level.FIGS. 25A and 25B are views of assistance in
explaining the prior art.The above image forming apparatus will be explained
by exemplifying, e.g., an electrophotographic printer
apparatus. As illustrated in FIG. 25A, a precharger 91
charges the photosensitive drum 90 with an electricity.
Thereafter, an image exposure is effected by an exposing
unit 92, thereby forming an electrostatic latent image
corresponding to an exposed image. A developing unit 93
is disposed for developing the electrostatic latent image
on this photosensitive drum 90. This developing unit 93
feeds an internal powdery developer (e.g., a 1.5-component
developer) to the photosensitive drum 90 and develops the
electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum 90.This developed image formed on the photosensitive
drum 90 is transferred onto a sheet fed from an
unillustrated sheet cassette by means of a transferring
unit 94. Then, the image-transferred sheet is fed to a
fixing unit 96, wherein the developed image on the sheet
is fixed thereto. On the other hand, residual toners on
the photosensitive drum 90 after the transfer are diffused
over the photosensitive drum 90 by using a diffuse brush
95.In this recording process, the transfer residual 
toners on the photosensitive
