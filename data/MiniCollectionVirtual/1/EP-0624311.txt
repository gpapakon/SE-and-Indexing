<ABSTRACT>
A device for transporting and delivering fodder or the like 
material, which device is movable and has at least one 

opening (2,3) for delivering the fodder, whereby the opening (2,3) is 
provided with a remotely controlled cover flap (8,9), which is 

capable of at least partially covering the opening. A 
conveyor (6) displaces the fodder towards the opening. The 

conveyor (6) can only be driven when the cover flap (8,9) has been 
moved to its entirely or nearly entirely open position, for 

which purpose a common control mechanism (16) is present. 
Locking means may be present, which lock a cover flap 

against being opened when another cover flap is open.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for transporting and
delivering fodder or the like material, for example silage
material, said device being movable and having at least one
opening for delivering the fodder, said opening being
provided with a cover flap which is capable of at least
partially covering the opening, whereby a conveyor is
provided, for example a bottom chain, or a conveyor belt,
which is capable of displacing the fodder towards the
opening, whereby the cover flap of the opening can be
operated by remote control. Near the opening also a further
driven mechanical device to treat or to dose the fodder may
be present, for example a roller. Such device is disclosed
in FR-A-2,634,345.A device of this type is generally provided with a hopper
in which the silage material to be transported to the
feeding place may be deposited. For that purpose the device
may be provided with a cutting or sawing apparatus for
detaching the silage material, and possibly with special
means for depositing said material into said hopper. The
device may furthermore be provided with means for loosening
the silage material, for example rotatable rollers provided
with catch means.Usually such a device is furthermore provided with a roller
or a pair of rollers, which may deposit the silage material
from the hopper onto the conveyor, for example in the form
of a bottom chain or a conveyor belt, which transports the
silage material towards the opening of the device when the
device is present at the feeding place. Frequently such a
device is provided with two openings on either side of the
device, so that an amount of fodder may be delivered from
each side of the device, as desired, whilst the device is
moving along the feeding places. The openings of such a device may be provided with a cover
flap, on the one hand in order to prevent undesirable
falling out of silage material, whilst on the other hand
safety is enhanced because the opening is no longer
accessible.The object of the invention is to obtain a device for
transporting and delivering fodder or the like material,
whereby said delivering of fodder may take place in a safe
and efficient manner.In order to accomplish this objective the cover flap of the
opening is controlled by a control mechanism operated by the remote control, which control
mechanism includes a hydraulic control cylinder to operate the cover
flap and a hydraulic valve for switching off the
conveyor drive
when the cover flap is not in its
entirely or nearly entirely open position. For example, as

<CLAIMS>
A device for transporting and delivering fodder or the
like material, for example silage material, said

device being movable and having at least one opening
(2,3) for delivering the fodder, said opening being

provided with a cover flap (8,9) which is capable of
at least partially covering the opening (2,3), whereby

a conveyor is provided, for example a bottom chain (6)
or a conveyor belt, which is capable of displacing the

fodder towards the opening (2,3), whereby the cover
flap (8,9) of the opening (2,3) can be operated by

remote control (16) 
characterized in that
 the cover
flap (8,9) is controlled by a control mechanism (19)

operated by the remote control (16)
,
 which control
mechanism (19) includes a hydraulic control cylinder (20,21) to

operate the cover flap (8,9) and a hydraulic valve
(28,31,41,42) for switching off the conveyor drive (15)

when the cover flap (8,9) is not in its entirely or
nearly entirely open position.
A device according to claim 1, said device being
provided with at least two openings (2,3) for

delivering fodder, whereby each of said two openings
(2,3) is provided with a remotely controlled cover

flap (8,9), which may at least partially cover the
openings (2,3), 
characterized in that
 locking means
are provided, which lock one cover flap (8,9) against

being opened when the other cover flap (8,9) is open. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the hydraulic control cylinder (20) for a
cover flap (8,9) has a first position, in which the

cover flap (8,9) is opened, a second position, in
which the cover flap (8,9) is closed, and a third

position, in which the cover flap (8,9) is locked in
the closed position.
A device according to claim 3, 
characterized in that

said hydraulic control cylinder (20) is connected to spring means (24),
in such a manner that in said second position the

cover flap (8,9) can be opened against spring tension.
A device according to any one of the claims 2 - 4,

characterized in that
 the two cover flaps (8,9) are
interconnected by mechanical means (21,22,26), in

order to effect said locking.
A device according to any one of the claims 2 - 5,

characterized in that
 the two cover flaps (8,9) is
controlled by means of the hydraulic control cylinder

direction opening one cover flap (8,9) and locking the
other cover flap (9,8).
A device according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the cover flap (8,9) is pivoted
