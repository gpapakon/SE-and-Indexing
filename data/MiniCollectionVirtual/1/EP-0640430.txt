<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for cladding precious 
metals to precipitation hardenable materials. In accordance 

with one aspect of the present invention, are the steps of (i) 
placing a precious metal layer of a first selected thickness 

atop a selected beryllium-copper alloy base metal strip of a 
second selected thickness to approximate a desired final product 

thickness, (ii) cold rolling the layer and strip to reduce their 
respective thicknesses by generally more than 50%, (iii) heating 

the layer and strip to a first selected temperature generally 
within a range of 1000°-1300°F, (iv) maintaining the first 

temperature for a first selected time to promote metallic 
bonding of the layer to the strip while softening the base 

metal, (v) pickling the layer and strip to remove surface 
oxides, (vi) cold rolling the layer and strip to a thickness 

generally 11% greater than that of the desired final product 
thickness, (vii) heating the layer and strip to a second 

selected temperature generally within a range of 1250°-1400°F, 
(viii) maintaining the second temperature for a second selected 

time to effect dissolution of the beryllium into the copper and 
growth of metallic grains in the alloy to 
a desired size, with 
minimal diffusion of the base metal into the precious metal, 

(ix) pickling bonded strip and layer to remove surface oxides, 
(x) cold rolling the layer and strip generally to the desired 

final product thickness, (xi) heating the layer and strip to a 
third selected temperature generally within a range of 500°-800°F 

and (xii) maintaining the third temperature for a third 
selected time to resurrect strength, ductility and conductivity 

of the base metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for joining
precious metals to precipitation hardenable materials and more
particularly to a process for cladding a precious metal to a
precipitation hardenable base metal which minimizes use of
precious metal while sustaining strength, ductility and
conductivity of the base metal.When cladding a precious metal to a precipitation hardenable
base metal, thermally induced diffusion (or interdiffusion)
between the metals is common. The result is diminished purity
of the precious metal. Because interdiffusion is a function of
temperature, it becomes significant when cladding with base
metals of relatively high annealing temperatures, e.g.,
beryllium-copper alloys.To compensate for interdiffusion, substantial amounts of
precious metal have been used in excess of that required for the
finished product, i.e., electronic connectors. For this reason,
beryllium-copper alloys have been found relatively costly for
use as a base metal.Conventional copper alloys with relatively low annealing
temperatures such as phosphor bronze are processed, e.g., by
cladding, with minimal interdiffusion. While relatively economical
for use as a base metal, phosphor bronze lacks the
strength, ductility and conductivity of beryllium-copper alloys.US-A-3302280 discloses a method of bonding silver to a
beryllium-copper bar. A slot is formed in the bar and silver is
pressed into the slot. The bar is heated to 650°C - 815°C
(1200°F - 1500°F) and hot rolled.
The bar may then be reduced to any final size desired by
conventional rolling and annealing techniques. In accordance with the invention,
there is provided a process for cladding precious metals
to precipitation hardenable materials, which comprises
the steps of:
(a) placing a precious metal layer of a first
selected thickness atop a selected precipitation
hardenable base metal strip of a second selected
thickness to approximate a desired final product
thickness;(b) roll bonding the layer to the strip;(c) heating the layer and strip to a first selected
temperature;(d) maintaining the first temperature for a first
selected time to promote metallic bonding of the layer to
the strip while softening the base metal and with minimal
diffusion of the base metal into the precious metal;(e) pickling the layer and strip to remove surface
oxides;(f) roll bonding the layer to the strip;(g) heating the layer and strip to a second
selected temperature;(h) maintaining the second temperature for a second
selected time to effect dissolution of one constituent
