<ABSTRACT>
2.1. To increase the load-bearing capacity of packages made of thin packaging material, for example paper, a blank for an outer wrapping (14) is provided with localised reinforcements, namely reinforcing strips 15, 16, 17, 18, for example, which are arranged spaced-apart and parallel to one another, preferably on the inner side of the blank and are connected to the latter. 2.2. In the case of outer wrappings (14) having cutouts (19) for applying tax stamps, etc., to the wrapped cigarette packages (10), the reinforcing strips (15..18) extend in such a way that transverse webs (22) formed between the cutouts (19) each have one reinforcement.

Pack in the form of an outer wrapping (14) made 
from thin or low-strength packaging material, especially 

paper, for forming a bundle pack containing a group of 
individual cigarette packs (10), the outer wrapping (14) 

having recesses (19) for affixing markings (stamps) in 
the region of end faces (12) or bottom faces (13) of the 

cigarette packs (10), characterized by local reinforcing 
strips (15, 16, 17, 18; 26) increasing the tearing 

strength of the outer wrapping (14) and located at least 
in the region of the recesses (19). 
Pack according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the outer wrapping (14) has a plurality of tear-resistant 

reinforcing strips (15, 16, 17, 18), especially made from 
plastic, which are arranged at a distance from one 

another. 
Pack according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the reinforcing strips (15 to 18) are affixed at least in 

the region of transverse webs (22) of the outer wrapping 
(14) which are arranged between adjacent recesses (19). 
Pack according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the reinforcing strips (15 to 18) run continuously 

from one edge of the outer wrapping (14) as far as the 
opposite edge, especially four reinforcing strips (15 to 

18) which are arranged parallel to one another and which 
respectively extend centrally along the transverse webs 

(22). 
Pack acording to Claim 1 or one of the further 
claims, characterized by local sheet-like reinforcements 

in the form of at least one reinforcing label (26) which 
is connected to the outer wrapping (14), preferably in  

 
the region of the recesses (19). 
Pack according to Claim 5, characterized in that 
the reinforcing label (26) is made strip-shaped and 

extends in the region of a side wall (20) of the outer 
wrapping (14), the said side wall (20) having the 

recesses (19), whilst the reinforcing label (26) is 
arranged at least in the region of a longitudinal web 

(21) and in the region of transverse webs (22) as a 
limitation of the recesses (19). 
Pack according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the strip-shaped reinforcing label (26) has a width 

larger than that of the side wall (20) having the 
recesses (19), in such a way that the recesses (19) are 

surrounded on all sides by the reinforcing label (26), 
edge strips (30, 31) of the latter extending in the 

region of adjacent walls, namely top wall (23) and bottom 
wall (24) of the outer wrapping (14). 
Process for the production of blanks from thin 
packaging material, especially paper, for packs according 

to one or more of Claims 5 to 7, by severance from a continuous 
material web, characterized in that the blanks, 

after being severed from the material web, are moved in 
a direction transverse to the direction of transport of 

the material web, namely sideways, and in that, during 
the sideways movement, at least one strip-shaped reinforcing 

label (26) is affixed to a region (20) of the 
blank extending transversely relative to the conveying 

direction of the material web, and in that the blank 
provided with the strip-shaped reinforcing label (26) is 

then moved further. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the blank provided with the strip-shaped reinforcing 

label (26) is moved as a result of the renewed change of 
the direction of transport. 
Process according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized 
in that, after the strip-shaped reinforcing label (26) 

has been affixed to the blank of the outer wrapping (14), 
recesses (19) are punched into the blank and the reinforcing 

label (26) in the region of the reinforcing label (26).
