<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention novel 
medical dressing systems and methods are disclosed 

using a semiperipheral support design which provides 
at least one conformal, unsupported dressing edge 

upon application. The dressing system disclosed 
herein comprises a backing layer, an adhesive 

material overlying the backing layer and a release 
liner overlying the adhesive, wherein said medical 

dressing system further comprises a final dressing 
potion and a semiperipheral support portion partially 

surrounding said dressing portion and said support 
portion being partially defined by a separation, said 

dressing portion being further defined by at least 
one unsupported edge, said one or more unsupported 

edges extending from a first end to a second end of 
said semiperipheral support portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical
dressings as defined in the preamble of claim 1. Such medical
dressings are e.g. known from US-A-4 413 621.Medical dressings are popular for use on
anatomical wounds to protect the wounds and promote
healing, at catheter sites to secure and stabilize
the catheters, as surgical drapes to define a sterile
field and in diverse medical procedures to perform
various other functions. Many medical dressings are
of minimal thickness to provide great flexibility
allowing the dressings to flex and conform to the
irregular shapes and contours of anatomical and other
surfaces to which they may be applied and to permit
moisture to penetrate the dressings to prevent
maceration of the skin. Such dressings typically
include a thin backing sheet or film, a layer,
surface, or body of adhesive carried by the backing
sheet and a removable release liner disposed over the
adhesive. Upon removal of the liner, the dressing is
flexible, conformable, supple, limp or flimsy due to
the minimal thickness thereof such that there is a
tendency for the dressing to wrinkle, buckle, fold or 
turn over on itself. Accordingly, handling of the
dressing and application of the dressing to a surface
can be difficult, tedious and can result in portions
of the dressing becoming stuck together or the
dressing being improperly applied.Various delivery systems for medical dressings
have been proposed to facilitate handling and
application of the dressings. Many proposed delivery
systems are part of the medical dressings themselves,
and U. S. Patent Nos. 4,413,621 to McCracken et al,
4,485,809 to Dellas, 4,664,106 to Snedeker, 5,160,315
to Heinecke et al and RE 33,353 to Heinecke and
European Patent 0,051,935 are illustrative of such
medical dressing delivery systems. Some of the
disadvantages of prior art medical dressing delivery
systems include complexity, increased number of
parts, increased material and manufacturing costs,
intricate handling and application protocols, the
need for multiple release liners and touching of or
other contact with the adhesive during handling
and/or application with concomitant impairment of
cleanliness and adhesion. Some prior art medical
dressing delivery systems utilize a release liner
having a central window portion and a continuous
outer frame portion with the central window portion
being removable separately from the backing sheet to
expose a face of the backing sheet carrying the body
of adhesive. Upon removal of the central window
portion, the support portion remains
