is an amino organofunctional trialkoxysilane or a quaternary 

ammonium organofunctional trialkoxysilane; (iii) a blend of

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the use of certain 
organosilicon compounds and combinations thereof, to treat 
cellulosic and masonry surfaces, to render such surfaces 
water repellent. In U.S. Patent No. 5,073,195, there is disclosed an 
aqueous solution formed by combining water, a silane coupling 
agent and an alkyltrialkoxysilane which is used as a treating 
agent for cellulosic and masonry surfaces to render such 
surfaces water repellent. The present invention is an 
aqueous solution which we have found to exhibit better water 
exclusion when it is combined with certain waxes. Thus, the 
addition of a wax to an aqueous treating solution has been 
found by us to result in better water repellency properties, 
than can be obtained with either an aqueous treating solution 
alone or with a wax alone. It has also been found that emulsified silicone 
resins can be combined with an aqueous treating solution and 
a wax to provide even better water exclusion and repellency, 
than can be obtained with either an aqueous treating solution 
alone, with a wax alone or with an emulsified silicone resin 
alone. With the advent of various federal and state 
environmental constraints on volatile organic content, water 
based systems have significant advantage and value in the 
market place, especially in construction and architectural 
applications. The invention provides compositions and methods of 
treating cellulosic and masonry surfaces with aqueous 
solutions formed by combining one or more alkyltrialkoxysilanes, 
an amine or quaternary ammonium functional silane  
 
coupling agent, an aqueous silicone resin emulsion, wax 
blends of petroleum and synthetic hydrocarbon waxes; and 
mixtures thereof. When applied to such surfaces, these 
compositions exhibit excellent water beading, water exclusion 
and water repellency characteristics. The invention is also directed to aqueous based 
compositions for construction and architectural applications 
which comply with the various state and federal regulations 
limiting volatile organic content. A composition according to the present invention is 
in the form of an aqueous solution made by combining water 
and (i) an alkyltrialkoxysilane with C1 to C10 alkyl groups 
on silicon or a blend of alkyltrialkoxysilanes each with C1 
to C10 alkyl groups on silicon; (ii) a silane coupling agent 
having the formula RSi(OR')3 in which R' is an alkyl group of 
one to six carbon atoms and R is a reactive organofunctional 
group which is an amino or a quaternary ammonium
