<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an item of apparatus for inspecting the physical condition of pipelines to which man cannot gain access or which man cannot inspect. The apparatus of the invention consists of a carriage (1) which can move in translation inside a pipeline (2), controlled remotely from outside, and especially including a fixture (6) mounted so that it can rotate about a longitudinal axis (7) at the front of the carriage and supporting an exploration device (90, 90') which can be moved as desired between a position in which it is retracted on to the fixture and a position in which it is deployed in contact with the interior wall of the pipeline, the said fixture being provided with a means (85b, 86b) for detecting the actual relative position of the exploration device. The invention is intended especially for inspecting town sewerage mains.
