<ABSTRACT>
Electromagnetic shielding device between housing parts for electronic equipment, formed by a contact spring with two legs (1, 2) which embrace in an elastic way the edge of one of the housing members, positioning itself permanently by means of at least one flap (5) created and sharply bent-in on one leg, which engages in an aperture provided in the housing member. The legs (1, 2) are connected by a portion (4) formed by a circumference arc of more than 180 DEG , and one of the said legs (1) is substantially longer than the other (2) forming a recess inside of which the laps (5) of the other leg abut when the spring is at rest, in order to obtain a preload of the spring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic 
shielding device for cabinets of electronic equipment, in 
particular cubicles, racks, housings and similar, provided 
with at least one openable element, such as e.g. a shutter, 
a door, a gate, a covering panel, etc. Further the invention will be illustrated with 
reference to a preferred application on cabinets for 
telecommunication equipment, but this should not be 
understood in a limiting sense as the invented device can 
be applied to numerous other equipments where the 
realization of a shielding against transmitted or received 
electromagnetic interference is necessary like in portable 
radio equipment. In general this type of devices consists of elastic 
elements or springs, and such springs are fixed along the 
edges of the opening destined to be closed by shutters, or 
more in general the non airtight parts, in order to 
guarantee the electrical contact between the parts, and 
consequently an efficient shielding. The dimensions and the 
number of such devices depend on the characteristics of the 
required shielding, and, in particular in telecommunication 
equipment operating at very high frequencies, the number of 
such devices per length unit is considerable. Electromagnetic shielding device between parts of 
housing for electric equipment are already known, which 
consists of a contact spring with a triangular isosceles 
profile, which opening corresponds to a summit with at 
least one in bent flap.  
 Such spring has to be inserted in such a way that it 
clasps the edge of one of the housing parts, fitting 
permanently by means of the flap engaging in an aperture 
provided in the housing member, and with one leg abutting 
against the other housing member when this is approached to 
the previous one. This known device presents the drawback of the lack of 
preload and, as a consequence, it is not able to exert a 
minimum contact force for its total operative arch (of 
deformation). That's why the contact pressure is inferior 
to that minimum necessary for an appreciable initial stroke 
of the complete travel. DE-U-9 106 955 discloses an electromagnetic shielding 
device between housing members for electronic equipment 
comprising a strip of contact springs connected together by 
weakened portions, each spring having a first leg and a 
second substantially flat leg shorter than the former, said 
legs being connected at one of their ends by a curved 
portion elastically urging the legs one against the other, 
and suitable to embrace the
