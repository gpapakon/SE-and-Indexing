<ABSTRACT>
A current mirror which is activated by an input current (ie) and outputs an output current (ia) proportional thereto, in which the input current (ie), on the one hand, is conducted to the interconnected gates of a first and second transistor (1, 2) and, on the other hand, with interposition of a resistor (5), to a terminal of the load path of the first transistor (1), in which the other terminal of the first transistor (1) and a terminal of the load path of the second transistor (2) are in each case connected via the load path of a third and, respectively, fourth transistor (3, 4) to a common reference point, in which the interconnected gates of the third and fourth transistor (3, 4) are connected to one terminal of the first transistor (1) and in which the output current can be picked up at the other terminal of the second transistor (2).

Current mirror which is driven by an input
current (i
e
) and emits an output current (i
a
) which is
proportional thereto,


the input current (i
e
) being passed, on the one hand, to
the control terminals of a first and second transistor

(1, 2), which control terminals are coupled to one
another, and being passed, on the other hand, with the

interposition of a resistor (5), to one terminal of the
load path of the first transistor (1),
the other terminal of the first transistor (1) and one
terminal of the load path of the second transistor (2)

being connected to a common reference point in each case
via the load path of a third and fourth transistor (3,

4), respectively,
the control terminals of the third and fourth transistors
(3, 4), which control terminals are coupled to one

another, being connected to the one terminal of the first
transistor (1),
it being possible to pick off the output current at the
other terminal of the second transistor (2),

characterized in that the input current (i
e
) is dependent
on a second resistor (10) and a third resistor (12),

which is identical to the second resistor (10), is fed
with the output current (i
a
).
Current mirror according to Claim 1,

characterized in that the first and second transistors
(1, 2) and the third and fourth transistors (3, 4) are in

each case constructed identically.
Current mirror arrangement according to either of 
Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that the second and third resistors (10,
12) vary by an identical factor.
