A respiration bag for a hand-operable respiration apparatus for the
artificial respiration of persons, which is formed from an elastic, air-excluding

material in the form of an elongated hollow body with an average wall thickness,
with a substantially circular cross-section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis

and with grip faces for the differentiated reduction of the volume of the hollow
body, which has an air inlet opening and an air outlet opening, the grip faces (3)

being arranged substantially concentrically and one behind the other in the
direction of the longitudinal axis at at least one end of the hollow body (1)

around the longitudinal axis and the diameter of the hollow body (1) decreasing
towards the at least one end having grip faces (3), characterised in that the

diameter of the hollow body (1) decreases by stages, each grip face (3)
respectively forming a stage and that the regions with a concave curvature (6)

respectively formed between two grip faces (3) have an increased wall thickness
compared with the average wall thickness of the hollow body (1).
A respiration bag according to Claim 1, characterised in that the diameter
of the hollow body (1) is reduced by precisely two stages.
A respiration bag according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
precisely one end of the hollow body (1) has grip faces (3).
A respiration bag according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the increase to the wall thickness in the regions with concave curvature (6)

amounts to at least 25 %.
A respiration bag according to Claim 4, characterised in that the increase
to the wall thickness amounts to approximately 50 % to 100 %. 
A respiration bag according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
the grip faces (3) are marked by elevations (8) on the surface of the hollow

body (1).
