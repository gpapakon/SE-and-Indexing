<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus capable of reproducing the voice of reading aloud a book for a sufficient period of time. At 
the time of reproduction, the speed of reading is variable, and the output voice is normal as in the normal speed 

reproduction. The apparatus comprises means for digitally storing voice signals in a mode that the voiceless parts are 
coded substantially; means for generating voices by reproducing the digital voice signals at a desired speed of speech; 

and means for adjusting the desired speed of the speech.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a voice 
recording/reproducing device and, more specifically, to a 
voice reproducing device such as a device for learning 
and education or a voice-producing electronic book and 
the like. There has been proposed a device for reproducing 
voice by using a digital large-capacity recording medium 
such as CD-ROM or the like, the reproducing time, 
however, lasting for about 70 minutes at the longest. 
The reproduction of such a length may be enough for 
recording music but is not enough for recording the whole 
recitation of such a book as a paperback, a study book or 
the like. In particular, in the case of a learning 
device which is used by a user for understanding and 
recognition by repetitively playing the device and 
reproducing a clear voice while changing the speed such 
as lowering the speed for extended periods of time, the 
above-mentioned digital recording medium is far from 
being of practical use unless the contents of the study 
material are adjusted or omitted. Further increased 
difficulty is encountered when other storage media are 
used. In addition, it was often required to intentionally 
adjust the speed of recitation during recording. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
voice recording/reproducing device which is free from the 
above-mentioned problems inherent in the prior art, 
enables the voice data to be stored in sufficient amounts 
in a predetermined recording medium and further enables 
the voice output which is close to natural recitation to 
be obtained for an extended period of time at the time of  
 
the reproduction. In order to accomplish the above-mentioned object, 
the voice recording/reproducing device according to the 
present invention basically has the following technical 
constitutions. That is, a voice reproducing device comprising a 
voice signal recording means for recording a voice signal 
of which a voiceless part is converted into a 
predetermined voiceless part indication data signal, and 
a voice reproducing means which reproduces the recorded 
voice signal at a desired speed of speech. Concretely, a 
voice recording/reproducing device comprising a voiceless 
part indication conversion means which converts a 
voiceless part included in an input voice signal into a 
predetermined voiceless part indication data signal, and 
a recording means for recording an input voice signal 
including the voiceless part indication data signal 
converted by the voiceless part indication conversion 
means. More concretely,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A voice reproducing device comprising a voice 
signal recording means for recording a voice signal of 

which a voiceless part is converted into a predetermined 
voiceless part indication data signal, and a voice 

reproducing means which reproduces the recorded voice 
signal at a desired speed of speech. 
A voice recording/reproducing device 
comprising a voiceless part indication conversion means 

which converts a voiceless part included in an input 
voice signal into a predetermined voiceless part 

indication data signal, and a recording means for 
recording an input voice signal including the voiceless 

part indication data signal converted by the voiceless 
part indication conversion means. 
A voice recording/reproducing device 
comprising a voiceless part indication conversion means 

which converts a voiceless part included in an input 
voice signal into a predetermined voiceless part 

indication data signal, a recording means for recording 
an input voice signal including the voiceless part 

indication data signal converted by the voiceless part 
indication conversion means, and a voice reproducing 

means for reproducing an input voice signal recorded in 
said recording means at a desired speed of speech. 
A voice recording/reproducing device according 
to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein provision is further 

made of an adjusting means for adjusting the speed of 
speech during the reproduction of voice by said voice 

reproducing means. 
A voice recording/reproducing device according 
to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the voiceless part 

indication data signal in said voiceless part indication 
conversion means is a signal for deleting said voiceless 

part. 
A voice recording/reproducing device according 
to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the voiceless part 

 
indication data signal in said voiceless part indication 

conversion means is a signal representing data related to 
the time of said voiceless part. 
A voice recording/reproducing device according 
to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the voiceless part 

indication data signal in said voiceless part indication 
conversion means is a signal representing data related to 

a position in said input voice signal in which said 
voiceless part is disposed. 
A voice recording/reproducing device according 
to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a plurality of said 

voiceless part indication data signals output from said 
voiceless part indication conversion means are stored in 

a concentrated manner at a predetermined position of said 
recording means. 
A voice recording/reproducing device according 
to any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein, in reproducing said 

input voice signals, said voice reproducing means 
reproduces said voiceless part indication data signals 

recorded in said recording means while inserting them in 
predetermined positions in a sequence of said input voice 

signals according to predetermined data that have been 
imparted to said voiceless part indication data signals.
