<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to multi-layer printed circuit boards, film printed circuit boards and semi-finished products for printed circuit films and a process for their production, with through-plating (12) structured in insulator layers (2), structured apertures (4, 4') in cover layers (A, A') of the surfaces (O, O'), current tracks (SP) structured in conductive layers and contact points (K, K'). To reduce the number of photochemical structuration operations required, the through-plating (12) and the cover apertures (4, 4') are mechanically structured in that pre-formed through-plating apertures (10, 10') are etched in insulating layers (2) in accordance with through-plating structures (8, 8') of masking films (7, 7'), electrically conductive substances are deposited in the through-plating apertures (10, 10') to form contact layers (11) in said through-plating apertures (10) and apertures (4, 4') are etched in accordance with contact structures (3, 3') of masking films (7, 7') in cover layers (A, A') in such a way that the apertures (4, 4') form cover-material-free regions on the printed circuit boards and film printed circuit boards and on the semi-finished products for such printed circuit boards and the apertures (4, 4') are freely shaped so as to be cylindrical, round, oval, square, rectangular or polygonal.
