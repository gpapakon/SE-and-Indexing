<DESCRIPTION>
 REDUCED-FAT, READY-TO-EAT FOOD ITEMFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a reduced-fat, ready-to-eat food item comprising a cereal component, a water-soluble dietary fiber composition component, and a binder component. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention comprises a reduced-fat, ready-to-eat granola food bar having good flavor and texture.BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Ready-to-eat food items, especially food bars, or snack bars as they may be appropriately termed, are known and have been available for some time. Some snack bars generally contain one or more grains, nuts, dried fruit, sweeteners and other ingredients. These ingredients are typically mixed with a binder such as a sugar syrup or nortening and compressed into bars or slabs which may be later cut to a desired size. Depending on the snack bar's composition, it may be mixed, formed, and/or baked prior to packaging and sale.Consumers who purchase and eat these snack bars may be health conscious and thus careful about what they eat. For such consumers, these food bars, or snack bars, would be even more desirable if they contained reduced-fat levels.However, in such food bars, fat is typically added in the preparation of the bar. Fat may be added as a binding agent and/or in the form of an oil, which acts to keep the food bar tender and imports other desirable organoleptic properties, such as flavor and mouthfeel. When the oil is not added, or is replaced with water and sugar syrup, the resulting food bar has a poor texture in that it is excessively hard and brittle, and thus is typically not as acceptable to consumers. In the present invention, however, when the water-soluble dietary fiber composition of the present invention is added to food items, particularly food bars, as a replacement for such oils, it has been surprisingly found that a reduced-fat,SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

ready-to-eat food item can be prepared with few, if any, of these undesirable effects.BACKGROUND ART As already stated herein, ready-to-eat food bars are known. U.S. Patent No. 4,451,488, issued May 29, 1984 to Cook et al., discloses a ready-to-eat food bar. This food bar typically comprises a granola mix, corn syrup, crisp rice, sugar, glycerin, shortening, salt and other flavorings, and antioxidants. The food bar also may contain nuts, chocolate chips, and dried fruit. The granola mix typically comprises oat and wheat flakes, peanuts, whey solids, milk solids, coconut, sugar, corn syrup, oil, and honey. The oil is typically added to the granola mix to

 CLAIMS
1. A reduced-fat, ready-to-eat food item comprising a cereal component, a water-soluble dietary fiber composition component, and a binding agent component, wherein a sufficient amount of each component is used to provide for said food item to be formed into a desired shape and maintain said shape.
2. A food item according to claim 1 comprising from about 19% to about 52% by weight of cereal component.
3. A food item according to claim 2 wherein said cereal component comprises a mixture of flaked cereals and processed cereals.
4. A food item according to claim 3 wherein said cereal component comprises from about 8% to about 30% by weight oat flakes, from about 2% to about 20% by weight wheat flakes, and from about 5% to about 30% by weight crisp rice, based upon the total weight of the ready-to-eat food item.
5. A food item according to claim 2 comprising from about 0.6% to about 10% by weight of water-soluble dietary fiber composition component.
6. A food item according to claim 5 wherein the ratio of maltodextrin to beta-glucans in said water-soluble dietary fiber composition is in the range of from about 3:1 to about 15:1.
7. A food item according to claim 5 wherein said water-soluble dietary fiber composition is prepared by a method comprising treating an aqueous dispersion of a gelatinized, milled beta-glucan containing grain substrate with an alpha-amylase under conditions which will hydrolyze the substrate and yield a soluble fraction and an insoluble fraction, separating said soluble fraction from said
S
UBSTITUTESHEET 


insoluble fraction, and recovering from said soluble fraction said water-soluble dietary fiber substantially free of water insoluble fiber.
8. A food item according to claim 7 wherein the beta-glucan containing grain substrate is an oat substrate.
9. A ready-to-eat food item according to claim 7 wherein the soluble fraction is separated from the insoluble fraction with a single decanting step.
10. A food item according to claim 5 comprising from about 10% to about 35% by weight of a binding agent.
11. A food item according to claim 10 wherein the binding agent further comprises from about 0.5% to about 3% by weight water-soluble dietary fiber composition, based upon the total weight of the binding agent.
12. A food item according to claim 11 wherein the binding agent is a syrup comprising from about 1.5% to about 2.5% by weight water-soluble dietary fiber composition; from about 3% to about 15% by weight high maltose corn syrup; from about 3% to about15% by weight high fructose corn syrup; from about 1% to about 7% by weight corn syrup solids; from about 1% to about 6% by weight glycerol; from about 0.5% to about 2% by weight sorbitol; and from about 0.1% to about 0.7% by weight salt, based upon the total weight of the ready-to-eat food item.
13. A food item according to claim 10 wherein the cereal and water-soluble dietary fiber composition components are first combined to form an initial mixture, said initial mixture is then combined with the binding agent when preparing the food item.
14. A food item according to claim 13 wherein the dry mix is enrobed with the coating.
