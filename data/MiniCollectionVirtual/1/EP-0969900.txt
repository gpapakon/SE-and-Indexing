<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and a corresponding method for the iontophoretic delivery of drugs that operates only when the supply voltage is higher than a predetermined threshold is provided. The apparatus includes a current control circuit (42) for controlling the current in an iontophoretic patch (4), and a supply voltage detection circuit. When a low supply voltage is detected, the current control circuit (42) is disabled, which stops the iontophoretic current, thereby stopping the delivery of drugs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of iontophoresis. In particular, the invention relates
to disabling automatically an iontophoretic drug delivery device when the device supply
voltage falls below a certain level, thereby preventing any further delivery of drugs to
the patient under a condition that may compromise the proper operation of the device.Iontophoresis is the application of an electrical current to transport ions through
intact skin. One particularly advantageous application of iontophoresis is the non-invasive
transdermal delivery of ionized drugs or other therapeutic agents into a patient.
This is done by applying low levels of current to a patch placed on the patient's skin,
which forces the ionized drugs contained in the patch through the patient's skin and into
his or her bloodstream.Passive transdermal patches, such as those used to deliver nitroglycerin for
angina pectoris, estradiol for hormone replacement, and nicotine to stop smoking, can
only use a limited number of drugs because they work by diffusion. Iontophoresis
advantageously expands the range of drugs available for transdermal delivery, including,
for example, parenteral drugs (e.g., peptides). Further, because the amount of drug
delivered is related to the amount of current applied, the drug delivery rate can be
precisely controlled by controlling the current, unlike the passive transdermal patches.
This allows for more rapid delivery (onset) and drug reduction (offset) in the patient.When compared to drug delivery by needle injection, iontophoresis can have less
physical and emotional trauma, pain, and possibility of infection. Transdermal drug
delivery by iontophoresis also avoids the risks and inconvenience of IV (intravenous)
delivery. In addition, when compared to oral ingestion of drugs, drug delivery by
iontophoresis bypasses the GI tract, thus reducing side-effects such as drug loss, 
indigestion and stomach distress, and eliminating the need for swallowing the drug.
Iontophoresis also avoids drug loss due to hepatic first pass mctabolism by the liver that
occurs when drugs are ingested.Further, transdermal drug delivery by iontophoresis permits continuous delivery
of drugs with a short half life and easy termination of drug delivery. Because
iontophoresis is more convenient, there is a greater likelihood of patient compliance in
taking the drug. Thus, for all of the above reasons, iontophoresis offers an alternative
and effective method of drug delivery, and an especially useful method for children, the
bedridden and
