<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disperse dye
composition suitable for dyeing a fiber mixture product
comprising polyester fibers having different deniers,
particularly a combined filament yarn fabric or union
cloth product comprising fine denier polyester fibers and
regular denier polyester fibers (hereinafter referred to
as a different denier polyester fiber product).Dyeing of a different denier polyester fiber product
comprising fine denier polyester fibers of e.g. from 0.1d
to 0.7d and regular denier polyester fibers of e.g. from
1d to 5d is carried out usually by a conventional dyeing
method with a known disperse dye. However, such dyeing
has a problem that the dyed product has a color
difference between fibers in use (i.e. poor in solid
dyeing) or undergoes a substantial decrease in fastness.Due to the difference in the specific surface areas
of the constituting fibers, the different denier
polyester fiber product has a difference in the dyeing
behavior of the dye, whereby a color difference between 
fibers in use or a decrease in fastness will result.The present inventors have conducted extensive
studies on the above problem and as a result have found
it possible to solve the problem by using a disperse dye
composition comprising:
(A) a yellow dye mixture comprising from 20 to 60 wt%
of a compound of the following formula (I) and from 80 to
40 wt% of a compound of the following formula (II) (the
sum of (I) and (II) is 100 wt%):

wherein each of X1 and X2 which are independent of each
other, is a halogen atom, and R1 is -C2H4CN or
-C2H4OCOC6H5, and(B) a blue dye mixture comprising from 75 to 95 wt%
of a compound of the following formula (III) and from 25
to 5 wt% of the following formula (IV) (the sum of (III)
and (IV) is 100 wt%): 

and/or(C) a red dye of the following formula (V):

wherein each of R2 and R3 which are independent of each
other, is a methyl group or an ethyl group.Now, the present invention will be described in
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments.In the yellow dye mixture (A), the ratio of the dye
of the formula (I) to the dye of the formula (II) is from
20 to 60 wt%:from 80 to 40 wt%, preferably from 30 to 50
wt%:from 70 to 50 wt%. The halogen atom for each of X1
and X2 in the formula (II) may, for example, be a
chlorine atom or a bromine atom, preferably a chlorine
atom.In the blue dye mixture (B), the ratio of the dye of 
the formula (III) to the dye of the formula (IV) is from
75 to 95 wt%:from 25 to 5 wt%, preferably from 80 to 90
wt%:from 20 to 10 wt%.If the
