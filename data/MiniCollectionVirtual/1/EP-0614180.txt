<ABSTRACT>
A disk playback device has a magazine for storing a plurality of 
carriages, each capable of carrying a disk. The magazine moves vertically 

relative to a chassis to align a playback position with a selected one of the 
carriages. A selected carriage is moved out the magazine and into the playback 

position for playing. Carriages selected for playback are in contact with 
adjacent carriages which tend to shift out of the magazine along with selected 

carriage. To prevent this unwanted shifting and retain a very compact 
configuration, the present invention provides a pair of parallel restrainers. The 

restrainers are mounted vertically on the chassis and fit into notches on the 
carriages stored in the magazine. A gap between the restrainers is positioned 

so that when the selected carriage is aligned with the playback position, the 
selected carriage is free to move into the playback position. The engagements 

between the notches of the adjacent carriages, however, prevent them from 
shifting along with the selected carriage. The restrainer is mounted behind the 

edges of the carriages closest to the playback position and therefor does not 
take up any room between the playback position and the magazine. Therefore, 

a high degree of compactness can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for playing back recorded
media and specifically to devices for changing compact disks.U.S. Patent No, 5,123,001 discloses a disk-changer device having a
stocker capable of holding multiple disks. The device described includes
carriages each capable of holding a disk. The stocker is capable of holding
multiple carriages. The stocker is provided with means for moving a selected
disk from a stored position in the stocker to a playback position and back to
the stored position. In this device, the stocker is moved vertically in order to
align the selected disk with the playback position. The carriage holding the
selected disk is pulled out of the stocker and moved to the playback position.
The non-selected disks remain behind in respective positions in the stocker.Adjacent carriages, which may be in contact with the carriage holding
the selected disk, may tend to move out of their respective storage positions
when the selected disk is moved to the playback position. To prevent this, a
plate spring in the stocker is used to retain the adjacent non-selected carriages.
The plate spring and the carriage are elastically engaged. However, there are
cases when the engagement between the plate spring and the carriage is
rendered ineffective by sudden movement of a chassis of the device, or the
like.To prevent a non-selected carriage from moving out of the stocker, a
rigid retaining device could be used. For example, a lock-plate fixed on the
chassis in front of the pulling-out direction of the carriage could be provided.
By incorporating a slot in an appropriate position on the lock plate, it is 
possible to permit only the selected carriage to move from the stocker by
passing through this slot. However, a lock-plate would limit the compactness
of the changer since it would have to be positioned between the stocker and the
playback position, narrowing the distance between the two. In addition, certain
changers improve compactness by not completely withdrawing the disk from
the stocker during playback. Thus, the disk being played overlaps disks in the
stocker. Such a system is disclosed in Japanese Laid-open publication number
62-212964. In such a system, space would be difficult to allocate for a lock-plate
positioned between the stocker and the playback position.It is an object of the present invention to provide a disk-changer device
which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior art.It is another object of the present invention to provide a disk-changer
which is highly

<CLAIMS>
A device for playing back disks comprising:

a magazine (50);
a plurality of carriages (58, 59) in said magazine;
each of said carriages having means for supporting (162) a disk in fixed relation

to itself;
said magazine having means for holding (51, 54) said carriages substantially
parallel with said disks carried on said carriages substantially parallel and said disks

being in axial alignment;
means for moving (28) a selected one of said carriages between a playback position
outside said magazine and a storage position inside said magazine;
means for moving (13, 15, 17, 88, 115) said magazine relative to said playback
position in a first direction perpendicular to a surface of said disks to selectably align a

selected one of said carriages in said magazine with said playback position;
means for preventing non-alignment of the carriages
when said selected one is aligned with said playback position by a movement

of said selected one of said carriages relative to said playback position;

said device characterized by:
said means for preventing (86, 87) non-alignment of said carriages pass through said carriages.
Device according to claim 1, wherein:

said means for moving (28) more said selected one of said carriages in a second direction
parallel to said surface of said disks;
said means for preventing (86, 87) are elongated in said first direction perpendicular
to said second direction.
Device according to claim 2, wherein: 

said means (163) on said carriages for engaging said means for preventing are
a notch;
said means for preventing (86, 87) have a channel (89) for permitting said selected
one of said carriages to be moved therethrough when said selected one is aligned

with said playback position; and
said means for preventing have at least one portion adjacent to said channel
contacting an adjacent carriage to said selected carriage to playback position effective to

prevent said adjacent carriage from shifting by engagement between said notch (163)
and said at least one portion..
Device as in claim 3, further comprising:

each of said carriages having an edge closest to said playback position;
means for lifting (43, 140) said edges of ones of said carriages above said selected
carriage to be lifted prior to said shifting; and
said notches of said carriages being shaped (167) to permit a lifting of said edges
by said means for lifting.
Device as in claim 2 or 3, further wherein

the means for preventing are a first (86) and a second (87) carriage restrainer;
said first and said second carriage restrainer are parallel and spaced apart end
to end to define a channel (89) therebetween for permitting said selected cariages to be

moved when said selected carriage is aligned with said playback position.
