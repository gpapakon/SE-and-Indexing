<ABSTRACT>
A pressure relief valve (10) is described which includes an apertured ball valve element (28), which is spring-loaded, and which is rotatably and axially mounted in the valve bore so that when an over-pressure situation arises fluid forces the ball (28) off a ball valve seat (50) against a spring force (40) and causes the ball valve (28) to rotate such that the aperture (32) in the ball valve (28) connects the inlet bore (20) and outlet bore (22) of a valve housing (16) so that fluid can flow through the pressure relief valve (16). When pressure at the inlet falls beneath a predetermined value, the spring force (40) forces the ball (28) to rotate and move back against the valve seat (50), thus closing the valve (10). With this arrangement there is minimal pressure exerted on the valve housing (16) and the valve (10) will operate with a back-pressure up to 50 % of the inlet pressure. This means that much smaller bore outlet piping can be used with savings in weight and, consequently, cost. For example, 3 in. piping may be used instead of 8 in. or larger piping for the equivalent rated valves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure relief
valve particularly, but not exclusively, for use with
pipelines carrying fluid at a predetermined pressure above
which the fluid requires to be vented so as to reduce
pressure in the system to a level beneath the
predetermined threshold. In particular, the pressure
relief valve is for use in hydrocarbon production
exploration industries and similar pressurised fluid
environments.Hydrocarbon fluid in a well test or well production
environment is maintained initially at pressure
substantially higher than atmosphere. The pipeline
containing the pressurised hydrocarbon fluid usually
contains a piece of equipment, such as a safety valve,
such that if an over-pressure situation occurs the well
fluid is vented to atmosphere via a oil rig pressure
relief burner boom. Such pressure relief valves have
been available for many years and one common type is a
flanged pressure relief valve which is spring-loaded and
which is coupled to the hydrocarbon pipeline. In the
event of an over-pressure situation arising, a valve
closure member is forced from a valve seat, against a
spring force to open the valve, whereby pressurised fluid
is allowed to flow through a valve outlet. A typical 
type of prior art valve is a Crosby spring-loaded flanged
pressure relief valve style JOS and JBS. Although these
types of valve are common in the industry, they suffer
from a number of disadvantages. One significant
disadvantage of this type of valve is that a back-pressure
at the valve outlet of approximately 10% of the inlet
pressure is sufficient to act together with a spring force
to close the valve leading to a potentially hazardous
situation. In addition, the top housing which contains
the spring element is rated at 120 p.s.i. which is
believed insufficient to use with a large range of
pressures commonly encountered in hydrocarbon process
equipment. In order for the valve to be used such that
the outlet pressure is less than 10% of the inlet pressure
large diameter piping is required at the outlet. This
piping is not only heavy, but is also relatively
expensive. A further consequence of the weight of the
piping is that in the production and exploration structure
at least 9 times the amount of piping weight requires to
be added for structural considerations. Therefore, where
considerable amount of piping is required, as is common in
oil exploration and production platforms, this can result
in a significant add-on cost in terms of weight and
overall structural costs as a consequence

A pressure relief valve (10) for relieving pressure
above a predetermined value in fluid flow lines, said

pressure relief valve comprising:-

a valve housing (16) defining a through-bore (18)
with a bore inlet (20) and a bore outlet (22),
a ball valve element (28) mounted in said bore (18),
said ball valve element (28) having a through-aperture

(32), and being mounted in said bore (18) such that said
ball valve element (28) is rotatable and axially moveable

within said bore (18),
said ball valve element (28) being coupled by a
cylindrical annular piston (34) to spring means (40)

biased to urge said ball valve element (28) into a closed
position, the arrangement being such that in response to

fluid at said bore inlet (20) exceeding a predetermined
pressure,
said ball valve element has an annular valve seat
(50) which is axially moved off an annular valve seat (52)

against the force of said spring means (40) and rotated
such that said through bore (18) allows fluid

communication between said bore inlet (20) and said bore
outlet (22), and when fluid pressure at said bore inlet

(20) falls beneath said predetermined level said spring
means (40) providing a restoring force to rotate and

axially move said ball valve element (28) onto said
annular valve seat (52) to close said pressure relief 

valve (10).
A pressure relief valve (10) as claimed in claim 1
wherein said spring means (40) is adjustable so that the

predetermined pressure at which the ball valve element
(28) is moved is variable.

claim 2 wherein the pressure relief valve means (10)

includes test coupling means (48) for coupling to valve
test apparatus by which the valve operation can be tested

in situ.

claim wherein the area of the valve seat (50) of the ball valve element is exactly

the same as the area of the annular valve seat (52).
A pressure relief valve as claimed in any preceding

claim wherein the ball valve element (28) in the housing

bore (18) has machined slots (54) of a predetermined
shape which are mounted on camming spigots (30) such that

as the ball valve element (28) is moved off the valve
seat (52) axially in response to inlet pressure above a 

predetermined threshold, it is simultaneously rotated
such that at the full open position, the through-aperture

(32) of the ball element (28) is aligned with the inlet

A pressure relief valve as claimed in any preceding
claim wherein the ball valve element is displaced by a

very small amount, such as 0.508 cm (0.2 in.), before it
