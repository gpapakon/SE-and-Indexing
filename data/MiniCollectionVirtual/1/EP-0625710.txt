<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for safety testing of solenoid valves, the excitation current of the actuating magnet of the valve being detected and stored over time, during one working cycle of the solenoid valve, as the measured function I = I(t). The control function I' = dI/dt is then digitally generated from the measured function and likewise stored after digitally taking the logarithm. The two functions can be displayed simultaneously on a screen and compared, by means of which improved and more accurate evaluation of the functional state of the solenoid valve in question, including possible faults, is made possible.
