<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to molded optical 
waveguides and, more particularly, to a simplified method of 
fabricating molded optical waveguides. At the present time, fabrication of optical waveguides is 
achieved by either a polymer spin-on technique or a diffusion 
technique, both of which require expensive photolithography 
steps. Additionally, both fabrication techniques are ineffective 
and inefficient for fabricating optical waveguides in high 
volumes for several reasons, such as complex processing steps, 
difficulties in controlling the processing steps, and high cost. Briefly, as practiced by one method in the prior art, a 
polymeric film is spun onto a substrate. Portions of the 
polymeric film are subsequently exposed to light by a 
photolithographic process, thereby changing the refractive 
index of the polymeric film and creating a waveguide in the 
polymeric film. However, subsequent multi-step processing, 
such as removal of the polymeric film from the substrate, 
lamination processing, curing, and other processes typically  
 
are required for the waveguide to be useful. Further, it should 
be noted that each additional processing step incurs an 
additional cost, as well as presenting an opportunity to induce 
defects into the waveguide. Alternatively, in another method practiced in the prior 
art, a layer such as a glass is applied to a substrate. The layer 
is patterned by a complicated photolithography process, 
thereby producing portions that are masked and portions that 
are open or clear. Typically, ions are subsequently diffused into 
the open portions of the layer, thus changing the refractive 
index of the layer and making a waveguide. However, by using a 
photolithography process, a high cost is incurred into 
manufacturing of the waveguide. Also, by using diffusion 
processes to change the refractive index of the layer, control 
of dimensionality of the waveguide is severely limited. Additionally, while making grooves in a plastic material 
and subsequently filling of these grooves with material for 
conducting light has been done in the past, these methods are 
only adequate for large mechanical orientated optical systems. 
Further, these methods characteristically are inefficient at 
conducting light, thus making them unsuitable for use in high 
speed communications. It can be readily seen that conventional methods for 
making waveguides have severe limitations. Also, it is evident 
that the conventional processing uses a multitude of steps 
which are not only
