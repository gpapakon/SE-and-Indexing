<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an aiming system for an aircraft, particularly a rotary wing aircraft, such as a helicopter. According to the invention, the aiming system comprises the combination of a first individual observation device (9), installed on the side of the aircraft (1), and a second individual axial firing device (10) installed at the front of the aircraft (1), the said first and second devices (9, 10) being connected to the on-board computer (11) of the aircraft (1).

A sighting system for an aircraft, in particular a rotary wing
aircraft such as a helicopter,

characterized in that it comprises in combination observation first
individual apparatus (9) integrated in the sides of the aircraft (1)

and axial fire second individual apparatus (10) integrated at the
front of the aircraft (1), said first and second apparatuses (9, 10)

being connected to the onboard computer (11) of the aircraft (1).
A sighting system according to claim 1, characterized in that the
first observation apparatus (9) comprises two sensors (12a, 12b)

integrated directly on the fuselage (2) of the aircraft (1) on
respective opposite sides of its longitudinal axis (X-X), each

covering about 180° in relative bearing and 20° to 40° in elevation.
A sighting system according to claim 2, characterized in that each
sensor (12a, 12b) has a plurality of elementary detectors (17), and

includes first optical scanning means comprising a bearing scanning
prism (18) enabling a bearing scan sheet (19) to be obtained, and a

prism (20) for tilting said sheet (19) enabling elevation scanning to
be performed.
A sighting system according to claim 3, characterized in that each
sensor (12a, 12b) includes a second optical system enabling a

fraction of the total field to be scanned, which second optical
system comprises a bearing scanning mirror (21) rotating at low speed

and a retractable lens (22).
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the axial fire second apparatus (10) is

integrated in the nose (8) of the aircraft (1).
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the axial fire second apparatus (10) is

integrated in the aircraft (1) above its cockpit (3). 
A sighting system according to claim 5 or claim 6, characterized
in that the axial fire second apparatus comprises a thermal camera

(10) having two simultaneous fields, namely a large field (23) for
acquiring targets (24, 25), and a small field (26) for identifying

and engaging a determined target (27) at long range.
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the observation first apparatus (9) and the

axial fire second apparatus (10) operate in the 8 micrometer to 12
micrometer band.
A sighting system according to claim 8, characterized in that the
observation first apparatus (9) also operates in the 3 micrometer to

5 micrometer band.
A sighting system according to claim 8 or claim 9, characterized
in that the observation first apparatus (9) also operates in the 0.45

micrometers to 0.9 micrometer band.
A sighting system according to any one of claims 8 to 10,
characterized in that the observation first apparatus (9) is

associated with a radar.
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that it includes means for memorizing targets

detected by the observation first apparatus (9).
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 12,
characterized in that it includes alarms associated with the

observation first apparatus (9) and active for fire control purposes.
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 13,
characterized in that sensors operating in the infrared or in the

visible spectrum enable the aircraft to be piloted in fire control
mode. 
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 14,
characterized in that different color symbology is used as a function

of the results of the identification friend or foe procedure.
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 15,
characterized in that the observation apparatus (9) presents a

display by means of a helmet-mounted sight.
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 16,
characterized in that the axial fire apparatus (10) presents a head-up

display.
A sighting system according to claim 17, characterized in that
the fire symbology is displayed on its own on a head-up brilliant

sight.
A sighting system according to any one of claims 1 to 16,
characterized in that the axial fire apparatus (10) has a "head

halfway" display.
