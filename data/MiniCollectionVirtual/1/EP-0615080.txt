<ABSTRACT>
A control system for a continuously variable sheave 
drive having a driving sheave assembly (124) and a driven 

sheave assembly (126) connected drivably by a torque 

transfer belt or chain (144), each sheave assembly being 
comprised of a pair of friction drive sheave portions 

(128/130 and 178/180) that are axially adjustable, one with 
respect to the other, to establish varying pitch radii, each 

sheave assembly having a fluid pressure operated servo with 
a pressure chamber (164/212) supplied with control pressure 

from a pressure source, distribution of control pressure to 
one servo assembly effecting a pitch radius adjustment 

thereby changing the overall drive ratio, control pressure 
distribution to the other sheave assembly resulting in a 

clamping force, and valve means for limiting the rate of 
delivery of pressurized fluid to the ratio controlling 

sheave assembly (124) so that control pressure will not fall 
below a desired value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control systems for 
continuously variable transmissions in an automotive vehicle 
driveline. This invention comprises improvements in a continuously 
variable transmission design of the kind disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,767,384. Other continuously variable 
transmission designs capable of embodying the improvements 
of this invention are shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,827,805 
and 4,836,049. It is common practice in the design of a continuously 
variable transmission (CVT) for automotive vehicles to match 
the ratio changing characteristics of the infinitely 
variable transmission with the speed/torque characteristics 
of a throttle-controlled internal combustion engine for the 
vehicle so that the powertrain package comprising the engine 
and the transmission will operate, under normal driving 
conditions, so that the engine and the transmission will 
achieve minimum brake specific fuel consumption for each 
engine throttle setting. This requires a continuous change 
in the ratio of the transmission as the throttle position 
and the engine speed change to meet the driving demands of 
the driveline. The adjustment in the transmission ratio is 
achieved by using primary driving and secondary driven 
sheave assemblies having relatively axially adjustable 
friction drive portions with juxtaposed cone surfaces. As 
the cone surfaces of each sheave assembly are adjusted, one 
with respect to the other, the position of a drive belt or 
chain located between the friction surfaces will change in a 
radial direction so that the overall ratio of the 
transmission will vary from a minimum underdrive ratio to a 
maximum overdrive ratio. Adjustment of the sheave portions of each sheave 
assembly of the CVT transmission is achieved by a primary 
fluid pressure operated servo comprising a piston located  
 
within a pressure cylinder. By varying the effective 
pressure on the primary sheave assembly, the ratio of the 
drive can be changed. The clamping pressure on each sheave 
assembly can be controlled by maintaining an effective 
clamping pressure on the secondary sheave assembly by a 
secondary fluid pressure operated servo. The control pressure that is distributed to the working 
chambers of the primary servo and the secondary servo of the 
CVT transmission is established by a control system that 
includes a pump driven by the engine. A regulator valve in 
the control system for the transmission achieves the desired 
working pressure in the sheave assemblies so that slippage 
of the belt

A control system for an infinitely variable ratio 
transmission in a vehicle driveline having an engine, said 

transmission having driving and driven sheave assemblies 
(124,126) and a frictional torque transfer drive belt (144) 

disposed between said sheave assemblies (124,126), said 
driving sheave assembly (124) being drivably connected to 

said engine, said control system having a primary sheave 
servo means for adjusting the effective pitch radius of said 

sheave assemblies and a secondary sheave servo means for 
establishing a belt clamping load, each servo means 

including a fluid pressure chamber (164,166,204), said 
pressure chamber being defined by relatively movable 

portions of said sheave assemblies (124,126); 

said pressure chambers (164,166,204) being in fluid 
communication whereby an increase in volume of the pressure 

chamber for one servo means is accompanied by a 
corresponding decrease in volume of the pressure chamber for 

the other servo means; 
a fluid pressure source (70,72), a fluid pressure 
distributor valve circuit connecting said pressure source to 

each servo means; 
a ratio valve means (246) and a sheave flow limit valve 
means (440) in said circuit for controlling distribution of fluid 

to said primary sheave servo means and for limiting the rate 
of fluid delivery to said primary sheave servo means, 

characterised in that said relatively movable portions of 
said primary sheave servo means define a ratio upshift 

pressure chamber and a ratio downshift pressure chamber 
whereby introduction of fluid under pressure to said upshift 

pressure chamber causes an increase in pitch radius of said 
driving sheave assembly (124) and introducticn of fluid 

under pressure to said downshift pressure chamber causes a 
decrease in pitch radius of said driving sheave assembly; 

and 
in that said sheave flow limit valve means (440) in said 
valve circuit limits the rate of fluid delivery to said  

 
upshift and downshift pressure chambers whereby the maximum 

rate of fluid delivery to said upshift and downshift 
chambers is less than the fluid flow capacity of said 

pressure source during a transmission ratio change. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, including an 
electronic microprocessor controller, means for sensing 

operating conditions including engine torque, engine speed, 
driven speed of said driven sheave assembly (126) and 

transmission ratio, said microprocessor communicating with 
each of said sensing means and having a central processor 

unit adapted to respond to said operating conditions to 
develop output signals in accordance with a stored 

algorithm;
 
   a sheave solenoid valve means (416) responsive to an 

output signal from said microprocessor that depends upon the 
magnitude of said sensed operation conditions for actuating 

said sheave flow limit valve means (440) and said ratio 
valve means (246), said controller commanding a fluid 

pressure level for said upshift and downshift chambers that 
establishes torque delivery through said belt (144) without 

slippage, said sheave flow limit valve means (440) being 
adapted to restrict the flow of fluid to said primary servo 

means when said pressure level commanded by said controller 
during a ratio change is less than a predetermined 

percentage of the commanded pressure level. 
A system as claimed in claim 2, wherein said 
predetermined percentage is about 80% of said commanded 

pressure level.
