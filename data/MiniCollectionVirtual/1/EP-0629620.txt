<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new photochromic
products.More specifically the present invention relates to
photochromic products belonging to the group of chromenes,
a procedure for their preparation and their use in
polymeric materials.Photochromic products are substances which have
the characteristic of reversibly changing colour and/or
degree of light transmission when they are exposed to
some types of electromagnetic radiation and solar
light, returning to their original state of colour and
light transmission when the initial source of light is
removed.There are numerous well-known substances having
photochromic characteristics and belonging to different
groups of both organic and inorganic products, as
described, for example, in the texts "Photochromism" by
G.H. Brown (Ed), Vol. III of the Weissberger series
"Techniques of Organic Chemistry", Wiley Interscience, 
New York (1971) and in "Photochromism: Molecules and
Systems", by H. Durr and H. Bouas-Laurent (Ed), Vol. 40
of the series "Studies in Organic Chemistry", Elsevier
(1990).Among organic photochromic products which are
particularly well-known are those belonging to the
group of spiro-indolino-oxazines, spiro-pyrans and
chromenes. The above products are capable of giving
photochromic characteristics to polymerized organic
materials, used as photochromic articles, as described,
for example, in patent applications: IT 22529 A/87. (corresponding to EP0 315 224 IT
22660 A/89) IT 19389 A/90 (corresponding to EP0 832 841), (corresponding to EP0 442 166), MI 91 A 002038 corresponding to EP0 524 692 all filed by
the Applicant, and in the following patents: U.S.
5.055.576, U.S. 5.110.922 both filed by the Applicant,
U.S. 3.567.605, U.S. 5.066.818 and EP 245.020.The photochromic products belonging to the above
three groups can be suitably mixed to obtain, after
irradiation with solar light or UV rays, the formation
of a colouring as a result of the composition of
colours of the products used. This composition of
colours is particularly useful in the preparation of
photochromic lenses composed of organic material for
which neutral shades such as green, brown and grey are
required by the market.Photochromic products used in the field of lenses
to obtain the colour blue or red are generally those
belonging to the group of spiro-indolino-oxazines owing 
to their good colouring characteristics and fatigue
resistance.The colours yellow and orange are, on the other
hand, generally obtained by using photochromic products
belonging to the group of chromenes
