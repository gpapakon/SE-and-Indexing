<ABSTRACT>
A display instrument for electrical control devices is specified, in which display means, for example a light-emitting diode with at least two resistors are connected between supply voltage and earth, and the control line leads out from the control device and is connected between the two resistors. In this case the control device influences the potential on the control line in such a way that display occurs only in the desired case, i.e. in the case of a recognised fault, but display likewise takes place in the event of a short circuit between the control line and the supply voltage as well as in the case of interruption of the control line.
