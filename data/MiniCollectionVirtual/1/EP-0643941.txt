<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for obtaining visual 
images of cornea cells allows magnified images of 

cornea cells to be easily obtained at required 
sites of the cornea including a centre site. 

A magnified image of the cornea cells 
is formed on the image-receiving surface (34) of 

the TV camera (35) via a magnification-imaging optical system (25) 
based on an illumination light (4), a centre view target (27) and 

a plurality of peripheral view targets (27₁) 
realised by visible-light emitting 

diodes (27,27₁) or the like. These light-emitting 
diodes are arranged to be switchable, one by one, by a centre 

lighting switch (39) and a peripheral lighting-change switch (37).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
obtaining visual images of cornea cells, by which images of
cornea endothelium cells of an eyeball of a subject person
can be observed or photographed under magnification, and
also relates to a method for displaying an imaging-position
around the cornea for this type of apparatus for obtaining
visual images of cornea cells.For seeing influences of contact lenses or for
medical examination and treatment before and after an
operation of cataract, it is necessary to observe the state
of cornea endothelium cells. Therefore, for observing or
photographing under magnification cornea endothelium cells
of an eyeball of a subject person, there have
conventionally been used apparatus in which with an
objective lens of a microscope of non-contact type or
contact type with respect to the eyeball surface of the
subject person, slit illumination light is applied toward
an observation part obliquely of the eye axis, and its 
reflected light from the cornea is magnified, in which
state the cornea endothelium cells can be observed, or in
which apparatus an optimum imaging position where a TV
camera or the like is focused on cornea endothelium is
detected by the principle of the so-called triangulation
method by detecting the position of the reflected light of
the slit illumination light from the cornea endothelium, in
which state the cornea endothelium cells of the subject
part can be imaged by the TV camera or the like.In these conventional apparatus, the focusing on
the cornea endothelium has been accomplished in the
following way. That is, the eye axis of the subject is
aligned with the optical axis of the microscope by manually
moving a microscope frame, which is the main body of the
apparatus and which has a TV camera mounted thereon, up and
down or right and left with the use of an operation member
such as a joy stick so that an alignment indicator light is
located at the center of the pupil of the eye on a monitor
screen. In this state, the frame of the main body is moved
back and forth also manually, so that the focusing is
accomplished. However, in making observation or
photographing with the above apparatus, there have been
demands for observing or photographing under magnification
not only the center portion but also various sites of the
cornea including peripheral sites, depending on what is 
examined in the medical treatment. This being the case, it
has been difficult to obtain successful images of sites
other than the cornea center portion. Also, even when
