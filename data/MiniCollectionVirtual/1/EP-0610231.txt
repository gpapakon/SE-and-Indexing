<DESCRIPTION>
 POWDER METAL ALLOY PROCESSFIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to a method or process of forming a sintered article of powder metal, and particularly relates to a process of forming a sintered article of powder metal by blending combinations of finely ground ferro alloys (either singly or in combination with other ferro alloys) of ferro alloys with elemental iron powder and other additives and then high temperature sintering of the article in a reducing atmosphere to produce sintered parts with oxygen contents less than 250 parts per million (ppm). More particularly the ferro alloys admixed to the base iron have a mean particle size of approximately 8 to 12 microns, having previously been ground to size in a inert atmosphere.Background to the InventionPowder metal technology is well known to the persons skilled in the art and generally comprises the formation of metal powders which are compacted and then subjected to an elevated temperature so as to produce a sintered product.Conventional sintering occurs at a maximum temperature of approximately up to 1,150° C. Historically the upper temperature has been limited to this temperature by sintering equipment availability. Therefore copper and nickel have traditionally been used as alloying additions when sintering has been conducted at conventional temperatures of up to 1,150°C, as their oxides are easily reduced at these temperatures in a generated atmosphere, of relatively high dew point containing CO, C02 and H2. The use of copper and nickel as an alloying material is expensive. Moreover, copper when utilized in combination with carbon as an alloying material and sintered at high temperatures causes dimensional instability and accordingly the use of same in a high temperature sintering process results in a more difficult process to control the dimensional characteristics of the desired product.Manufacturers of metal powders utilized in powder metal technology produce 

prealloyed iron powders which are generally more difficult to compact into complex shapes, particularly at higher densities (> 7.0 g/cc). Manganese and chromium can be incorporated into prealloyed powders provided special manufacturing precautions are taken to minimize the oxygen content, for example, by oil atomization. Notwithstanding this, these powders still have poor compressibilities compared to admixed powders.Conventional means to increase the strength of powder metal articles use up to 8% nickel, 4% copper and 1.5% molybdenum, in prealloyed, partially prealloyed, or admixed
