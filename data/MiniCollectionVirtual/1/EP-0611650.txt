Ribbon path indicator system for assisting an 
operator in webbing ribbons (20, 30) of a web material 

(10) exiting a printing unit (5) of a printing press 
through paths of rolls, comprising the following 

features: 

a plurality of rolls, each roll (40, 45, 50, 55, 
60, 90) having an associated remote display device (80); 
each associated remote display device (80) 
including a directional display indicator and a next roll 

display indicator, the remote display device (80) 
displaying ribbon path instructions to the operator 

including one of a clockwise or counter-clockwise wrapping 
direction, and the identity of a next roll to be 

wrapped; and 
a controlling means (160) coupled to each of the 
remote display devices (80), the controlling means 

issuing commands to each remote display device (80) to 
display a preselected one of the clockwise or counter-clockwise 

wrapping direction, and a preselected next roll 
(40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 90) to be wrapped. 
Ribbon path indicator system according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the controlling means (160) is 

a web management system which includes a processor (162) 
coupled to a storage means, in that the storage means 

stores a plurality of files, each of the files containing 
ribbon path information for a selected print job, in that 

the processor (162) operates to selectively retrieve a 
preselected one of the files and utilize the ribbon path 

information to instruct each remote display device (80)  
 

to display preselected ribbon path instructions to the 
operator. 
Ribbon path indicator system according to Claim 
2, characterized in that each roll (90) has a rear end 

(94) and a front end (92), in that the rear end (94) is 
mounted to a frame (104) of the printing press, and in 

that the remote display device (80) is mounted to the 
front end (92) such that the display indicators of the 

remote display device (80) are visible to the operator. 
Ribbon path indicator system according to Claim 
3, characterized in that each roll (90) has a bore (102) 

axially disposed therein, and in that each remote display 
device (80) has a cable (106) coupled to the controlling 

means (160) through the bore in its respective roll (90). 
Ribbon path indicator system according to Claim 
1, characterized in that each of the remote display 

devices (80) displays ribbon path instructions 
substantially simultaneously. 
Ribbon path indicator system according to Claim 
1, characterized in that the next roll display indicator 

of each remote display device (80) also displays a roll 
identifier which identifies the roll (90) to which each 

remote display device (80) is associated; and in that the 
controlling means (160) issues the command to each remote 

display device (80) to display the roll identifier for a 
respective roll (90). 
Ribbon path indicator system according to Claim 
6, characterized in that the next roll display indicator 

of each remote display device (80) alternately displays 
the roll identifier and the identity of the next roll 

(90) to be wrapped. 
Ribbon path indicator system according to Claim 
7, characterized in that each remote display device (80) 

further includes: 

a receiver (180) for receiving commands from the 
controlling means (160); 
a controller (200) having an input coupled to 
the receiver (180) for processing the commands received 

from the controlling means (160);  
 
the controller (200) has outputs coupled to each 
of a clockwise LED (130), a counter-clockwise LED (140) 

and an alphanumeric LED (150); and 
in that the microcontroller (200) operates to 
process the commands received from the controlling means 

(160), and to control the clockwise LEDs (130), the 
counter-clockwise LEDs (140), and the alphanumeric LEDs 

(150) to display the ribbon path information for their 
respective rolls (90). 
Method for assisting the operator in webbing 
ribbons (20, 30) of a web material (10) exiting a 

printing unit (5) of a printing press through paths of 
rolls in a system including a controlling means (160) 

coupled to a plurality of remote display devices (80), in 
which each of the remote display devices (80) is coupled 

to the controlling means and situated relative to a roll 
(40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 90) at which ribbon path decisions 

must be made, and the controlling means (160) includes a 
storage means which contains ribbon path information for 

a plurality of jobs, the method comprising the following 
steps: 


retrieving ribbon path information for a 
preselected job from a storage means; 
operating the controlling means (160) to issue 
commands, based upon the retrieved ribbon path information, 

which instruct each remote display device (80) to 
display a respective ribbon path instruction; 
receiving the commands in each remote display 
device (80); and 
operating each remote display device (80) to 
display its respective ribbon path instruction including 

one of a clockwise or counter-clockwise wrapping direction, 
and an identity of a next roll (90) to be wrapped. 
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the performing of each step of the remote display 

device (80) further includes operating each remote 
display device (80) to alternatively display a roll 

identifier, which identifies its associated roll (90), 
and the identity of the next roll (90) to be wrapped.  

 
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the performing of each step of the remote display 

device (80) further comprises operating each remote 
display device (80) to display its respective ribbon path 

instruction substantially simultaneously.
