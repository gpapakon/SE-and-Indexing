<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention fits in the technical field 
of ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) which prevent 
ribosome functioning catalytically by inactivating ribonucleic 
acid. More specifically, the present invention refers to 
non-toxic novel two-chain RIPs with potential use in cancer 
therapy and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS.) In the plant kingdom there are some species that 
contain protein biosynthesis inhibitory activity in 
systems derived from Eukaryotic organisms, which are of 
a protein type and which awaiting a precise biochemical 
definition are known as ribosome-inactivating proteins 
(RIPs) (Gasperi-Campani et al., Biochem. J. 186, 439-441 
[1980]; Gasperi et al., J. Nat. Prod. 48, 446-454 [1985]; 
Ferreras et al., Cell. Mol. Biol. 35, 89-95 [1989]; Merino 
et al., J. Exp. Bot. 41, 67-70 [1990]; Girbes et al., Cell. 
Mol. Biol. 38, 803-812 [1992]; Citores et al., Cell. Mol. Biol. 
39, 885-995 [1993]; Stirpe et al., Biotechnology 10, 405-412 
1992 ; Citores et al., FEBS Lett., 329, 59-62 [1993]. 
These proteins may have a polypeptide chain (type 1), two 
polypeptide chains (type 2) or four polypeptide chains 
(type 4.) (Citores et al., FEBS Lett. 329, 59-62 [1993]). 
The one polypeptide proteins are ribosome ribonucleic 
acid N-glycosidases (Stirpe et al., Nuc. Acid Res. 16, 
1349-1357 [1988]), while the two chain proteins have a 
ribosome ribonucleic acid N-glucosidase (chain A) and 
a lectin (chain B) (Stirpe et al., Biotechnology 10,405-412 
[1992]) which normally recognize galactose residues 
and derivatives thereof. Four chain proteins are formed 
by two A-B type dimers (each one equivalent to a type 2  
 
molecule) (Citores et al., FEBS Lett., 329, 59-62 
[1993]). These proteins (A and B) have a molecular mass 
(Mr) between 20000 and 34000. Chains A prevent ribosome 
functioning catalytically by inactivation of the ribonucleic 
acid (Jimenez and Vázquez, Annu. Rev. Microbiol., 39 
649-672 [1985]; Roberts and Selitrennikoff, Biosc. Rep. 6, 
19-29 [1986]; Stirpe, and Barbieri, FEBS. Lett., 195, 1-8 
[1986]; Stirpe et al. Biotechnology 10, 405-412 [1992]; 
Citores et al., FEBS Lett. 329, 59-62 [1993]; Girbes et 
a]., J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18195-18199 [1993]; Girbes et 
al., Plant Mol. Biol. 22, 1181-1186 [1993]. The inactivation 
consists of freeing an adenine of the larger rRNA 
of the ribosome (Endo and Tsurugi, J. Biol. Chem. 262, 
8128-8130 [1987]; Stirpe et al. Nucleic Acid Res. 16, 1349-1357 
[1988]; Girbes et al., J. Bacteriol, 175, 6721-6724;
