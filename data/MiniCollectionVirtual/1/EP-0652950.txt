<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention provides non-human mammalian hosts characterized by inactivated endogenous Ig loci and functional human Ig loci for response to an immunogen to produce human antibodies or analogs thereof. The hosts are produced by multiple genetic modifications of embryonic cells in conjunction with breeding. Different strategies are employed for recombination of the human loci randomly or at analogous host loci. Chimeric and transgenic mammals, particularly mice, are provided, having stably integrated large, xenogeneic DNA segments. The segments are introduced by fusion with yeast spheroplasts comprising yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) which include the xenogeneic DNA segments and a selective marker such as HPRT, and embryonic stem cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is the production of xenogeneic specific binding proteins in a viable non-human mammalian host.The ability to produce transgenic animals has been revolutionized with the advent of the ability to culture murine embryonic stem cells, and to introduce genetic modifications in these cells for subsequent transmission to the mouse germline. Thus one has the opportunity to modify endogenous genes to produce animal strains capable of producing novel products by introduction of foreign genes into the host, particularly human genes to produce xenogeneic binding proteins. The expression of such genes in vivo in an animal model may provide for investigation of the function of the gene, the regulation of gene expression, its processing, response to various agents and the like. In addition, animals with new phenotypes, including those that mimic a variety of diseases, may be produced. For example, there is interest in introducing a dominant mutation or complementing a recessive mutation. Depending on the particular gene, the difficulty of achieving the desired mutation will vary greatly. While some gene targets have proven to be relatively amenable to modification, other targets have proven to be extremely resistant to modification.Because of the opportunity for generating transgenic animals, there is substantial interest in providing new procedures that increase the success of production of transgenic animals. Particularly, where one wishes to introduce large DNA fragments, encompassing hundreds of kilobases, there is substantial concern about the ability to introduce the large fragments in intact form into mammalian cells, the efficiency of integration, the functional capability of the gene(s) present on the fragment and transmission in the germline to the progeny. In addition, such procedures for introduction of large DNA fragments provide for determination of the function of large DNA fragments identified in the ongoing human genome project.In particular, there is interest in producing xenogeneic specific binding proteins, for example human monoclonal antibodies, in small laboratory animals such as mice. Monoclonal antibodies find use in both diagnosis and therapy. Because of their ability to bind to a specific epitope, they can be uniquely used to identify molecules carrying that epitope or may be directed, by themselves or in conjunction with another moiety, to a specific site for diagnosis or therapy.Monoclonal antibodies comprise heavy and light chains which join together to define
