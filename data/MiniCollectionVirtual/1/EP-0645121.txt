<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method are described for selective 
cutting of the transverse carpal ligament of a patient. 

The instrument includes spaced-apart teeth which are 
supported on a first arm and a press member which is 

carried by a second arm. The teeth are prevented from 
contacting tissue when the first arm is inserted into, or 

retracted from, the carpal tunnel. After insertion of the 
first arm into the carpal tunnel, the teeth are exposed to 

the transverse carpal ligament and the first and second 
arms are moved towards each other to force the teeth into 

the transverse carpal ligament to perforate the ligament 
and enable it to elongate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical instruments. More
particularly, this invention relates to surgical
instruments for treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.The carpal tunnel is formed by an arch of the eight
wrist bones, spanned on its palmar surface by the
transverse carpal ligament, known as the flexor
retinaculum. The carpal tunnel functions as a mechanical
pulley to provide the appropriate moment arms for the
digital flexor tendons as they pass through the tunnel.
The tendons can then transmit force out into the fingers
and impart only an appropriate amount of tension to develop
torque at the level of the wrist.Within the carpal tunnel, these tendons are lubricated
and nourished by two synovial membranes - the radial and
the ulnar bursa. The median nerve also shares the carpal
tunnel, and then it branches out to provide sensory
innervation to the palmar surface of the thumb, index, long
and a portion of the ring finger. In addition, a small
motor branch of the median nerve supplies the thenar
muscles, which are responsible for lifting the thumb into
opposition with the fingers.Carpal tunnel syndrome refers to numerous clinical
signs and symptoms resulting from pressure on the median
nerve inside the carpal tunnel. The typical etiology is
increased pressure within the carpal tunnel, which
interferes with the function of the median nerve. The
patient experiences numbness and tingling in the fingers, 
together with pain that may radiate as far as the shoulder
or base of the neck. Other symptoms include impaired
grasping ability (due to sensory deprivation from the
digits), loss of sleep from pain and numbness in the hand,
and weakness or atrophy of the thenar muscles.The pathology generally results from a swelling of the
synovial membranes, which is typically idiopathic. Carpal
tunnel syndrome can also be caused by pressure on the
median nerve from rheumatoid arthritis or edema in the
final trimester of pregnancy, or other diseases.Many instances of carpal tunnel syndrome can be
treated conservatively, typically with a resting splint and
cortisone injection into the carpal tunnel. However, if
symptoms persist and/or reoccur, or if the patient has
severe sensory deficit or loss of functions in the thenar
muscles, then surgical decompression of the nerve by
release of the transverse carpal ligament is often
indicated.Surgical decompression has been accomplished, in early
techniques, by a longitudinal incision paralleling the
thenar crease. The incision was carried down through the
skin, subcutaneous fat,
