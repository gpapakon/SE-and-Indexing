<ABSTRACT>
The known process in which a base coating and on this the
magnetic coating and finally a top coating are applied, have the

disadvantage that the corrosion resistance is not adequate: there
are defects. It is not inconceivable that it is possible for

water to diffuse into the substrate.
In accordance with the invention, a barrier layer is interposed
between the substrate and the base coat by medium frequency

pulsed sputtering at a frequency of 10 to 200 kHz and a pulse
length to pulse pause ratio from 5:1 to 1:10.
The invention finds application preferably for hard magnetic
disks of high storage density.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for coating thin film coated
magnetic disks of high storage density for use in hard magnetic
disks, by means of magnetron sputtering, and a thin film magnetic
disk produced using this method.The methods of producing thin film magnetic disks in vertical
continuous coaters for a large number of substrates to be coated
together, or in single disk coaters, are already known. The
substrates for the production of thin film magnetic disks consist
of glass or of highly polished aluminium disks galvanised with a
nickel-phosphorous coating. In future, various alternative
materials such as aluminium borocarbide will be used.Irrespective of the substrate material, a number of thin coats
are applied by physical and/or chemical atomisation of the coats.
These are base coats, mostly consisting of chromium, magnetic
storage layers, mostly consisting of composite alloys of cobalt,
chromium and other metals, and a top coat, mostly consisting of
carbon. DC magnetron sputtering is the most commonly used coating
method in the production of thin film magnetic disks.For high-quality thin film magnetic disks, a storage density in
excess of 3 Gbit/in2 is required. The resulting flying heads of
the magnetic heads are below 40 nm. A reduction in noise and in
holidays on the storage surface and effective adaptation to the
heads are pre-requisites for the realisation of this storage
density.The method of achieving the low flying heads by improving the
topography of the surface of the finished thin film magnetic disk 
and reducing the thickness of the coatings, especially the
magnetic coat and the top coat, is already known. By using new
alloys for the magnetic storage layer and specially adapted
underlying structures, thin film magnetic disks with coercive
field strengths of > 1,99 x 105 A/m (2500 Oe) and remanent
magnetisation layer thickness (Mrt) of â‰¥ 0.5 can be produced with
good reproducibility.New problems, not previously encountered, have arisen chiefly due
to demands for increasing storage density and reducing the
thickness of the coatings.A decisive shortcoming is the fact that increased corrosion
occurs with the use of aluminium substrates. This corrosion gives
rise to blooming and warping on the surface of the magnetic disk,
which results in areas which can no longer be written on or read.
There is a danger that these may come into contact with the
heads, as the flying head is around the same height as the
blooming. Two factors have an effect on corrosion. On the one
hand, errors in
