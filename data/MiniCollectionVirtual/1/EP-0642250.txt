<ABSTRACT>
A modular digital recording system that records audio 
on digital audio tapes has been conceived that provides 

redundancy and the ability to record audio while listening 
to portions of audio that had been recorded on the DAT. The 

system uses a hard disc 32a that receives audio for recording 
simultaneously with the DAT. When one wishes to listen to a 

voice message, one can activate the hard disc to listen to a 
particular message while the DAT is still recording. The 

system is modular so that the capacity can be expanded as 
required. The system includes a LAN adapter so that the 

system can provide networking access.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the field of voice processing, there are
circumstances in which it is necessary that audio, such as
conversations, be recorded and the time when such recordings
took place be established. Systems capable of providing
this requirement have been commercially available for a long
period and are referred to as recording loggers, or loggers
for short. Prior systems have worked rather well, but were
based for a long time on analog technology. Because of
this, the prior logger systems were physically large and the
tapes that recorded audio for archival purposes were also
large, thus requiring a large amount of storage space.To overcome these drawbacks of prior analog loggers,
digital loggers have recently been developed and offered
commercially. Although these commercially available digital
loggers yielded advantages over the prior analog loggers,
they still had shortcomings in terms of networking
expandability and voice capacity. It clearly would be
advantageous to provide a digital logger that overcomes
these disadvantages of prior digital loggers. In addition,
it would be desirous of having a digital logger that is
modular in construction so that the capacity of such logger
can be increased in a convenient and economic manner and
software can be upgraded as required.EP-0-550-273-A2 discloses a digital signal processing
circuit board usable in a voice processing system. Voice
processing functions are run in software to allow a modular
structure since the application software resides in boards
coupled to a host computer. This allows the software to be
updated and the capacity of the system to be expanded to
meet increasing needs.JP-A-03-128569 discloses a reception image storage
system for storing facsimile pages onto digital audio tape. According to the present invention, there is
provided a voice recording system as set out in Claim 1.According to the present invention, there is also
provided a modular digital recording logger as set out in
Claim 5.According to the present invention, there is also
provided a logger network system as set out in Claim 10. A modular digital recording logger has been conceived
that provides advantages not only over prior analog loggers,
but prior digital recording loggers as well. The modular
digital logger of the instant invention has a basic unit
that comprises four primary components, an audio card that
monitors audio sources (such as telephones), a main card
that processes audio, a host computer that controls the
overall operation and memory.The audio card serves the
