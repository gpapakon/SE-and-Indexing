<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heterocycle-containing 
carbonic acid derivatives and intermediates 
used for the production of the heterocycle-containing 
carbonic acid derivatives. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to novel heterocycle-containing 
carbonic acid derivatives which exhibit an 
excellent preventive or therapeutic effect against 
various diseases. Retinoic acid (vitamin A acid) is a substance 
essential for the growth and life-preservation of 
human beings and other mammals. It is known that this 
acid acts as a morphogenic factor in the ontogenesis 
and also variously acts on the differentiation and 
multiplication with respect to the adults. For 
example, it is known that the acid participates in 
cornification, formation of hair or function of 
sebaceous gland with respect to the epidermis; in the 
metabolism of bone and cartilage with respect to the 
connective tissue; in the regulation of immune 
function with respect to the immune system; in the  
 
differentiation of nerve cell with respect to the 
nervous system; in the differentiation and 
multiplication of blood cell with respect to the blood 
system; and in the secretion of thyroid and 
parathyroid hormones and the function thereof in 
target organs. Thus, retinoic acid is a substance 
which much participates in the mineral and basal 
metabolism. These various physiological activities of 
retinoic acid are exhibited by directly controlling 
the gene expression through a retinoid receptor family 
(RARS, RXRS) present in the nucleus of a cell. With 
respect to retinoid acid, there have been known not 
only hypovitaminosis but also hypervitaminosis such as 
cornification disorder, alopecia and metabolic 
disorder of bone and cartilage. Further, it has 
recently been reported that the disorder of retinoid 
receptor is found in acute promyelocytic leukemia, 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, 
pulmonary carcinoma and so on, i.e., the disorder 
thereof participates in the sideration and evolution 
of these diseases. Under these circumstances, the 
development of a compound antagonistic to retinoids is 
believed to contribute to the elucidation of detailed 
mechanism of these various activities of retinoids and 
the investigation of clinical applicability thereof.  
 Up to this time, TD-550, TD-560 and Ro41-5253 have 
been known as compounds antagonistic to retinoids [see 
Cell Biol. Rev., 25, 209 (1991), and Proc. Natl. Acad. 
Sci. USA., 89, 7129 (1992)]. However, these compounds 
are thought to be poor in
