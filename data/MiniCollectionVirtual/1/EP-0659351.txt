<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a device for producing deep-frozen edible masses having an increased gas content, for example ice cream, a fluid matrix comprising at least one component being sprayed into a cooled compartment (5) and in this manner a finely dispersed, flowable, frozen powder being produced which is then further processed. In this manner, it is possible to save on equipment for homogenization, pasteurization and the like, which otherwise requires high capital costs.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the preparation of ice cream, frozen dessert and fruit masses, cake
masses, dough masses, from several hard-to-mix fluid matrices consisting of at

least one component, comprising

a) a refrigerated chamber designed as a freezer spray tower (5);
b) several spray nozzles (4) for introducing several fluid components forming
the matrix into the freezer spray tunnel (5) as a drop-shaped, finely divided

mist;
c) a refrigerating unit for cooling the interior of the freezer spray tower (5);
d) a collecting vessel (9) at the bottom of the freezer spray tower (5) for collecting
the drops which, while falling through the freezer spray tower (5), have

turned into deep-frozen, free-flowing powder or snow;
e) a conveying system for refrigerated conveyance of the frozen, free-flowing
powder or snow for processing;
f) a compacting device (27) ensuring compactibility of the deep-frozen, free-flowing
powder or snow so as to be perfectly suitable for storage, the mode

of operation of the compacting device (27), viz. the speed of the double extruder
being controlled as a function of the back pressure measured by a

pressure gauge (33) between a back pressure orifice plate (31) and extruder
outlet device or via the power input of the screw driving motor (34) in such a

manner that a defined degree of compaction is product-mass specifically
adjustable with specified intake material.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the pressure gauge (33) is
interposed between the back pressure orifice plate (31) and the orifice relief of the

extruder.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized in that the worms used
in the compacting extruder are not arranged to mesh with an axial displacement

corresponding to half the worm channel width, and are provided with a worm root
(40) flaring out in the direction of conveyance in the material intake zone.
