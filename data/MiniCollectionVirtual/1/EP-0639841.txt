<ABSTRACT>
Female contact, especially for high-voltage isolator, characterised in that it comprises two interpenetrated bell shapes, a first metal bell shape produced by extrusion of a metal block followed by machining, the said first bell shape comprising metal contact fingers (2) intended to interact electrically with a male contact (8), the other bell shape comprising fingers (11) made of an insulating material, the insulating fingers (11) limiting the excursions of the contact fingers, in the radial direction and in the lateral direction, to predetermined values below the elastic deformation limit of the finger, and insulating the contact fingers from one another, as well as the contact fingers of a possible pressure spring surrounding the contact fingers, so as, when short circuit forces are present, to counteract the risk of welding of the fingers and/or burning of the spring.

A female contact, in particular for a high tension section switch,
including a metal first thimble provided with metal contact fingers

(2) designed to cooperate with a male contact (8) and separated from
one another by insulating elements, the female contact being

characterized in that it includes a first thimble made by extruding a
block of metal and then machining it, and insulating elements

constituted in the form of fingers (11) carried by a second thimble,
said fingers made of insulating material limiting the displacement of

the metal contact fingers in a radial direction and in a lateral
direction to predetermined values that are less than the elastic

limit of deformation of the metal contact fingers, and serving in
particular to prevent contact between the metal contact fingers.
A female contact according to claim 1, characterized in that the
contact fingers of the metal thimble have a section in the form of a

rectangle with rounded edges, and possess a ridge (2A) extending over
at least a fraction of the length of the finger.
A female contact according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the insulating material fingers of the second thimble are of the same

length as the metal contact fingers.
A female contact according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the insulating material fingers (11) of the

second thimble are of a section that is substantially rectangular
with rounded edges and each possesses a ridge (11A) projecting from

one of the large faces of the rectangle.
A female contact according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the length of the contact fingers is adjusted

by machining a groove (4) in the extruded metal block.
A female contact according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the block includes a cylindrical thread (5)

designed to have a centering cone (7) provided with ice-breaking
spurs (7A) screwed thereon to receive the male contact (8), said cone 

serving to limit the total deflection of said interleaved thimbles
when assembled together.
A female contact according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that it includes a spring (15) surrounding the

insulating fingers and acting through them to impart contact pressure
to the metal fingers (2) without electrical continuity being

established between the spring and the metal contact fingers.
