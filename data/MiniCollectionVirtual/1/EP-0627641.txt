<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber array is provided in which a 
plurality of optical fibers (12) are arranged and fixed 

in a fiber array member (11). The optical fibers each 
have an end projecting from an end face (11b) of the 

fiber array member at substantially the same distance, 
and each has a lens (12a) formed at the end thereof. 

The optical fiber array is produced by a method 
comprising the steps of: arranging and fixing a 

plurality of optical fibers in the fiber array member 
such that an end of the optical fibers is projected from 

the end face of each of the fiber array member; forming 
a coating layer of a desired thickness over the end 

face of the fiber array member and portions of the 
optical fibers projecting from the end face of the fiber 

array member; collectively polishing the ends of the 
optical fibers projecting from the end face of the fiber 

array member, together with the coating layer, up to a 
predetermined position, thereby making the lengths of 

projections of the optical fibers substantially equal; 
and removing the coating layer and forming a lens at 

each end of the optical fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber
array coupled to a semiconductor laser diode array and
a method of producing the optical fiber array, and more
particularly, to an optical fiber array in which a
plurality of optical fibers, each having a lens formed
integrally at an end thereof, are arrayed in such a
manner that they project from an end face of a fiber
array block by substantially the same length, and a
method of producing the optical fiber array.A conventional light-emitting module incorporated
in an optical communications system comprises a laser
diode (hereinafter referred to as "LD") serving as a
light source, and a lens interposed between the LD and
an optical fiber for converging the laser beam onto the
core of the optical fiber. To make good use of the
energy of the LD, the module is required to have a high
coupling efficiency which is the ratio (%) of the
amount of light incident on the optical fiber to the
amount of light emitted from the LD. To this end, the
light-emitting module is assembled with the optical
axes of the LD, lens, and optical fiber aligned with
each other, so as to achieve a maximum coupling
efficiency between the LD and the optical fiber.Recently, an optical fiber has been proposed in
which a lens is formed directly on an end thereof
(hereinafter referred to as "lensed optical fiber"). 
In this type of optical fiber, the fiber end itself
functions as a lens. Consequently, the number of parts
constituting the module is lessened. Also, the number
of operations required for the optical axis alignment
during manufacture can be reduced, whereby the cost is
cut down.The lensed optical fiber is produced in the manner
described below, for example.First, an optical fiber, from which a jacket has
been removed, is heated locally by heating means such
as a burner, with a tensile force applied thereto,
whereby the heated portion extends. When the outer
diameter of the heated portion is decreased to about 10
Âµm or less, application of the tensile force is
stopped. After the diameter-reduced part is cut with a
cutter, the cut end of the optical fiber is again
heated by the burner for fusion. As the fiber end is
melted, its shape becomes semispherical due to surface
tension, and this semispherical end functions as a
lens.Thus, the lensed optical fiber has a semispherical
lens at an end thereof, as well as a taper portion of a
certain length whose diameter gradually increases with
distance from the semispherical end.A conventional light-emitting module using the
lensed
