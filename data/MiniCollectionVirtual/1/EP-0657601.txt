<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention it is characterised in that it comprises:     - a rigid horizontal section (2) fixed to the vertical framework (1) and having an upper clipping flange (6) and a lower flange (9), - one or more panels (22 or 23) located at each corner (14) of the tiling, with a clip which can be engaged in the upper flange (6) of the horizontal section (2) and a support flange integral with the panels in order to hold the tiles at the corners.   Application to the field of construction and of building when it is necessary to operate on new constructions or to renovate the facades of buildings from the outside.

Device for laying tiling on a vertical framework of wood or aluminium for
new works or renovation from the outside of buildings, including a rigid horizontal

profile bar (2) and one or several plates (22) or (23), characterised in that:

the rigid horizontal profile bar (2) is fixed to the vertical framework (1) and has a
snap-on upper wing (6) and a lower wing (9),
the plate or plates (22) or (23) are arranged at the level of each corner (14) of the tiling

with a clip capable of being inserted into the upper (6) or lower wing (9) of the
horizontal profile bar (2),
it includes a supporting wing integral with the plates, in order to maintain the tiling at
the corners,
one single plate (22, 23) allows to maintain four adjacent right angles (14), this plate
including four supporting wings,
the plate (22, 23) includes spacers against which abut the lateral sides (16) of the
tiling.
Device for laying tiling on a vertical framework, according to claim 1,
characterised in that the plates (22 or 23) have a different shape according to whether

they fit on the upper wing of the profile bar or on its lower wing.
Device for laying tiling on a vertical framework, according to claim 1,
characterised in that the plates are glued or keyed on to each corner of the tiling.
Device for laying tiling on a vertical framework, according to claim 1,
characterised in that the two upper supporting wings are folded upwards and snap onto

the outer face of the tiling.
Device for laying tiling on a vertical framework, according to any of claims 1
or 4, characterised in that the two lower supporting wings are folded downwards and

snap onto the outer face of the tiling.
Device for laying tiling on a vertical framework, according to claim 4,
characterised in that the two lower supporting wings are folded downwards and snap

onto the outer face of the tiling.
Device for laying tiling on a vertical framework, according to claim 4,
characterised in that the plate has spacers. 
Device for laying tiling on a vertical framework, according to claim 1,
characterised in that it allows the laying with aligned or offset joints, the upper or lower

supporting wings being capable of being torn away.
