A hydraulic system for a press, in particular for a power brake, with a 
differential cylinder (10) comprising a piston (11) separating a piston chamber (14) 

and an annular chamber (13) from each other and connected to an upper jaw of the 
press capable of travelling upwards as well as, in fast approach and press mode, 

downwards, and with a proportional directional valve (25) permitting control of the 
pressure fluid passages between a pump (40), a tank (41) and the chambers (13, 14) 

of the differential cylinder (10) and incorporating a valve spool (26) that can be 
shifted from a rest position, in particular monitored by a position sensor (29), into a 

work position, whereby, while the upper jaw is in fast approach mode, the pump (40) 
delivers to tank (41) in recirculation mode, and pressure fluid can be displaced at a 

controlled rate from the annular chamber (13) of the differential cylinder (10) into the 
piston chamber (14) of the differential cylinder (10) via the proportional directional 

valve (25) in its work position and replenished from the tank (41) into the piston 
chamber (14) of the differential cylinder (10) via an anti-cavitation valve (46), and 

whereby, while the upper jaw is in press mode, the pressure fluid delivered by the 
pump (40) and displaced from the annular chamber (13) of the differential cylinder 

(10) can be routed at a controlled rate to the piston chamber (14) of the differential 
cylinder (10) via the proportional directional valve (25), 
characterized in that
 the 
annular chamber (13) of the differential cylinder (10) can be isolated from the pump 

(40) and from the tank (41) by the proportional directional valve (25) in its rest 
position. 
A hydraulic system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a first 
outlet port (B) of the proportional directional valve (25) that can be connected to the  

 
annular chamber (13) of the differential cylinder (10) can also be connected to the 

passage linking the pressure side of the pump (40) and the piston chamber of the 
differential cylinder (10) when the valve spool (26) is in work position or isolated 

when the valve spool (26) is in rest position. 
A hydraulic system according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
proportional directional valve (25) comprises a first valve chamber (61) that can be 

connected to the pressure side of the pump (40), a second valve chamber (62) that can 
be connected to the piston chamber (14) of the differential cylinder (10), and a third 

valve chamber (65) that is permanently connected either exclusively to the first valve 
chamber (61) or exclusively to the second valve chamber (62), and that the third 

valve chamber (65) is connected to the first outlet port (B) when the valve spool (26) 
is in work position and isolated from the first outlet port (B) in rest position. 
A hydraulic system according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the third 
valve chamber (65) within a housing (6) of the proportional directional valve (25) is 

permanently connected either to the first valve chamber (61) or to the second valve 
chamber (62). 
A hydraulic system according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
proportional directional valve (25) comprises a first valve chamber (61) that can be 

connected to the pressure side of the pump (40), and a second valve chamber (62) 
that can be connected to the piston chamber (14) of the differential cylinder (10), and 

a valve chamber (63) connected to the first outlet port (B), the latter chamber being 
directly connected either to the first valve chamber (61) or to the second valve  

 
chamber (62) when the valve spool (26) is in work position and isolated in rest 

position. 
A hydraulic system according to any of the preceding Claims, 

characterized in that
 the proportional directional valve (25) is equipped with a 
position sensor (29) for the valve spool (26) and that this position sensor (29) is used 

to indicate the rest position of the valve spool (26). 
A hydraulic system according to any of the preceding Claims, 

characterized in that
 between the proportional directional valve (25) and the annular 
chamber (13) of the differential cylinder (10) is situated a valve (31), in particular one 

that is monitored, which in its rest position acts as a check valve blocking the passage 
from the annular chamber (13) to the proportional directional valve (25) and is open 

when in an actuated position. 
A hydraulic system according to any of the preceding Claims, 

characterized in that
 a pressure relief valve (42), in particular a pilot operated one 
whose condition can also in particular be monitored, is connected with the pressure 

side of the pump (40). 
A hydraulic system according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the pilot 
operated pressure relief valve (42) comprises a main spool (49) that can be relieved 

by means of a directional control valve (43) with a movable valve element (48), and  
 

that in particular the position of the valve element (48) can be registered by a position 

sensor (45), and that the directional control valve (43) is open in the rest position. 
A hydraulic system according to Claims 8 and 9, 
characterized in that
 it 
comprises two synchronously operated differential cylinders (10) that can be 

connected to a common pressure line (38), and that the pressure relief valve (42) is 
connected to this common pressure line (38).
