 IMPROVED PROCESS AND WASHED CATALYST FOR PARTIALLY HYDROGENATING AROMATICS TO PRODUCE CYCLOOLEFINSDescriptionTechnical FieldThis is a catalyst and a process for partially hydrogenating polycyclic and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, naphthalenes, biphenyls, and alkylbenzenes to produce the corresponding cycloolefins. The catalyst is a hydrogenation catalyst comprising ruthenium and a promoter metal, such as cobalt, on a composite support. It is a process in which the product cycloolefin is produced in high yield and with high selectivity.BackgroundCycloolefins are materials useful in the production of other high value products. For instance, in the commercial production of the polyamide known as NYLON 66, cyclohexene is first converted to cyclohexanol. The cyclohexanol is then oxidized to adipic acid with nitric acid, converted to a salt, and finally converted to the polymer. Other members of the cycloolefin family have similar utility. The previously used hydrogenation processes have fallen into two classes: one class consists of multistep processes starting with benzene or substituted benzenes and produces cyclohexanes or halocyclohexanes as intermediates. For instance, one such process involved the steps of hydrogenating benzene to form cyclohexane, 

oxidizing the cyclohexane to produce cyclohexanol, and dehydrating the cyclohexanol to produce cyclohexene. The other major multistep process involves the steps of halogenating benzene to produce a halobenzene, hydrogenating the resulting product to halocyclohexane, and dehydrohalogenating the halocyclohexane to cyclohexene.The other class of processes is a single step synthesis in which monocyclic aromatics are only partially hydrogenated to form the corresponding cycloolefins. Ruthenium catalysts are often used in these processes.U.S. Patent No. 3,912,787 discloses a partial hydrogenation process for the production of cyclic olefins using an aqueous dispersion of a solid ruthenium containing catalyst promoted with a transition metal. The aqueous dispersion is maintained at an essentially neutral or acid pH condition. The catalyst may be supported on well known oxidic supports. U.S. Patent No. 4,079,097 to Antos shows a process for dehydrogenating hydrocarbons using composite catalysts of a combination of a platinum group component, a cobalt component, and a bismuth component all on a porous catalytic carrier. U.S. Patent No. 4,197,415 shows a process for selectively partially hydrogenating aromatic hydrocarbons to cyclic olefins by
