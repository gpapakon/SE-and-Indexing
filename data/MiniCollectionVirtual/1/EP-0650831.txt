<ABSTRACT>
A printing apparatus for a cassette (2) accommodating a 
recording medium such as a tape-shaped recording medium or the 

like or a cassette accommodating case includes a cylindrical 
member (20) and a cylindrical pad (23). The cylindrical member (20) is 

supplied with an ink which contains an inorganic filler having a 
comparatively large particle size. The ink is added with a 

titanate coupling agent or an aluminate coupling agent. The 
cylindrical member has the concave printing plate formed on its 

peripheral surface and is supported rotatably. The ink on the 
concave printing plate is transferred to the cylindrical pad (23). 

The cylindrical pad is supported rotatably. The cylindrical pad 
is brought in contact with the concave printing plate and the 

surface of the conveyed cassette accommodating the recording 
medium or the conveyed cassette accommodating case. The ink 

transferred to the cylindrical pad from the concave printing 
plate is transferred to the surface of the conveyed cassette 

accommodating the recording medium or the conveyed cassette 
accommodating case.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method of
printing on a cassette accommodating a recording medium or
a cassette accommodating case and a cassette accommodating
a recording medium and particularly to intaglio printing
method on the cassette accommodating the recording medium
and the cassette accommodating case.Some recording-medium housing cassettes, for
example, tape cassettes and housing cases thereof, have on
their surfaces write areas (so-called label areas) formed
by direct printing with an ink on which letters and so on
can be directly written with a writing instrument. A title
of the cassette and so on can be directly written with the
writing instrument on the label area formed by printing.In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 shows an
example of the recording-medium housing cassette having the
label area, i.e., a tape cassettes, i.e., a so-called audio
compact cassette which is commercially available on the
market. A tape cassette 1 includes a plastic cassette
housing 2 in which a pair of hubs around which a magnetic
tape is wound as the recording medium are rotatably
accommodated. Insertion aperture 3a, 3b of hub driving
shafts for magnetic tape transport are formed through a
substantially middle portion of the tape cassette 1. The
cassette tape 1 has through its trapezoidal portion
insertion apertures 4a, 4b of capstans for the magnetic-tape
transport and reference apertures 5a, 5b used for
positioning the cassette in a recording and/or reproducing 
apparatus. These insertion apertures 3a, 3b, insertion
apertures 4a, 4b and the reference apertures 5a, 5b are
formed so as to pierce the tape cassette 1 in its thickness
direction. Though not shown, a plurality of opening
portions used for recording and/or reproducing an
information signal on and/or from the magnetic tape are
formed through a side surface corresponding to the
trapezoidal portion of the tape cassette 1.Reference numeral 6 depicts a print surface
which is formed on a surface of the cassette housing by a
so-called solid printing with the ink where letters and so
on can be directly written. The user can write numbers of
music and so on on the print surface 6 with a pen.A so-called pad printing is typically
considered as one of methods of such printing on the tape
cassette 1.A printing method based on the pad printing
will be briefly described with reference to Figures 2A
through 2F.As shown in Figure 2A, an ink 11 is coated on a
plate, i.e., an intaglio plate 10. Subsequently, as shown
in Figure 2B, an extra ink is removed by a blade

<CLAIMS>
A method of printing on a cassette
accommodating a recording medium or a cassette

accommodating case (1), comprising the steps of:

supplying an ink (11) to at least two concave
printing plates (30,31) formed on the peripheral surfaces

of respective rotatably supported cylindrical members
(20,21), said printing plates (30,31) each being provided

with a plurality of concave portions disposed to form
halftone pattern (30a,31a), the at least two members

(20,21) being disposed so that the halftone patterns
(30a,31a) are inclined at different angles (a,b) from each

other;
transferring said ink (11) from said concave
printing plates (20,21) to respective rotatably supported

cylindrical pads (23,24) which are brought in contact with
said concave printing plates (20,21); and
transferring said ink (11) successively from
said cylindrical pads (23,24) to the same surface of a

conveyed cassette or case (1) to print two halftone
patterns over the same surface by bringing said cylindrical

pads (23,24) successively into contact with the surface of
said conveyed cassette or case (1).
A method according to claim 1 wherein the ink
contains an inorganic filler including a titanate coupling

agent or an aluminate coupling agent in a proportion
between 0.1 weight % to ten and several weight %. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2 further
comprising the steps of providing a cassette body (2)

having a continuous groove (7) surrounding the surface
portion (6) which is to be printed and then performing said

step of the transferring ink (11) from the cylindrical pads
(23,24) to the surface surrounded by the groove (7) whereby

the groove delineates the printed area (6).
