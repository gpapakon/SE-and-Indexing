<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for 
preparing 2-cyanoimidazole compounds. 2-Cyanoimidazole 
compounds are useful as intermediates of agricultural 
chemicals or medicines. As for the method of obtaining 2-cyanoimidazole 
compounds, there have heretofore been known methods which 
comprise introducing a cyano group to the corresponding 
imidazole derivatives at the 2-position (cf., U.S. Patent 
4,995,898). In such known methods, it is necessary to perform the 
multi step sequence to obtain 2-cyanoimidazole compounds. In 
such cases, independent procedure is required for the 
formation of imidazole ring and the cyanation of the 
imidazole ring. Moreover, the cyanation procedures often 
require complicated processes. These known methods are not 
advantageous for the commercial production of 2-cyanoimidazole 
compounds. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a novel and advantageous process for commercially preparing 
2-cyanoimidazole compounds. The foregoing object of the present invention will 
become more apparent from the following detailed description  
 
and examples. The inventors made extensive studies of processes for preparing 
2-cyanoimidazole compounds. As a result, a new reaction has been 
found by which 2-cyanoimidazole compounds can be easily obtained by 
single step and raw materials in the reaction are readily available. Thus, 
the present invention has been worked out. The present invention relates to a process for preparing 2-cyanoimidazole 
compounds represented by the following formula (I): 
 
wherein R1 and R2 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a 
C1-10 straight or branched chain alkyl group which may be substituted, a 
phenyl group which may be substituted, or a 3- to 10-membered 
heterocyclic group which contains 1 to 4 hetero atoms selected from a 
nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom and a sulfur atom and a balance of 
carbon atoms, and which may be substituted, or R1 and R2 may join 
together to form an alkylene group which may be substituted; which 
process comprises undergoing reaction of a compound represented by 
the following formula (II):  
 
 
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above or salt thereof, with cyanogen. The substituents on the alkyl group represented by R1 or R2 
which may be substituted, are selected from those which have no 
adverse effects on the reaction, i.e. a halogen atom, a haloalkyl group, an 
alkoxy group, a haloalkoxy group, an alkylthio group, a haloalkylthio 
group, an aryl group, an aryloxy group, an arylthio group,
