<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of selecting routes in a 
communications network comprising a number of mutually isolated areas (A1, 

A2, A3, A4) at a first level, which areas are mutually linked at a second level, 
and in which network routing devices (R1-1, R1-2, ..., R2-5) are provided at 

both levels. For selecting a route from a first area (e.g. A1) to a second area 
(e.g. A4), in said method use is made of routing information, stored in the 

routing devices (R1-1, R1-2, ...) of the first level, relating to the first level 
and to reaching the nearest routing device (e.g. R2-5) of the second level. 

According to the invention, use is also made, in the routing devices of the 
first level, of routing information relating to the second level. The invention 

also provides a hierarchical communications network in which said method is 
applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of selecting routes in a 
communications network, as well as to a communications network in which 
such a method is applied. More specifically, the invention relates to a method 
of selecting routes in a communications network which comprises a number 
of mutually isolated areas at a first level, which areas are linked at a second 
level, in which network routing devices are provided at both levels for 
selecting routes, in which method for selecting a route from a first area to a 
second area use is made of a cost function and routing information stored in 
the routing devices, the routing information, stored in the routing devices of a 
particular area, relating to said area and to direct links from said area to 
routing devices of the second level, and at least some areas being directly 
linked to more than one routing device of the second level. Several methods of selecting routes in communications networks are 
known. A method of the type described above is known as the "IS-IS protocol" 
(cf. reference [1]). For the transmission of routing information, this known 
routing protocol occupies the capacity of the network only to a very small 
extent since only a minimum amount of information relating to that part of 
the network situated outside the area is to be present within a particular area. 
The routing information present in a routing device of the first level, that is 
to say in a routing device located in a certain area, is essentially limited to the 
area concerned. The only routing information relating to the second level 
which is present within the areas relates to the direct links to routing devices  
 
of the second level (level two), that is to say the links to "adjacent" routing 
devices of the second level. In the IS-IS protocol, the routing information 
stored in the routing devices of the first level can therefore be said to relate 
exclusively to the respective area and the direct links of that area with routing 
devices of the second level. As a result, although links within an area can be set up efficiently 
with the aid of the said protocol, there is the disadvantage that less efficient 
links are often selected mutually between the areas. In other words, because 
virtually no information relating to the second level is present at the first 
level and the costs of a total route can therefore not be foreseen, a less suitable 
link with the second level is often selected. Thus, an area cannot make any 
distinction between two routing devices,
