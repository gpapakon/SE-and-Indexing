<ABSTRACT>
A relief valve (60) including a hydraulic fuse (111) 
minimizes the chance of a device such as a 

hydraulically powered lift (10) device from collapsing 
upon a break in a hydraulic input line (58) to a cylinder 

(40) powering the lift. The relief valve (60) comprises a 
valve seat (105) biased in a first direction by a 

relatively heavy spring (96) and a hydraulic fuse (111) 
biased away from the valve seat (105) by a relatively 

light, second spring (120). Upon a break occurring in 
the hydraulic input line (58), back pressure urges the 

fuse (111) to seat against the valve seat (105), thus 
closing the valve. Upon applying additional hydraulic 

pressure in the direction of the fuse (111), the valve 
seat (105) disengages from the fuse (111), allowing 

hydraulic fluid to flow through the relief valve (60) and 
thus allowing a piston (48) in the hydraulic cylinder (40) 

to retract so as to permit lowering of the lift device 
(10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a relief valve with a hydraulic 
fuse, and, more particularly, the invention relates to 
a relief valve with a hydraulic fuse, wherein the fuse 
blocks retraction of a piston rod into a hydraulic cylinder 
upon a sudden drop in hydraulic pressure within the cylinder 
due to, for example, a hydraulic input line bursting. On occasion, hydraulic hoses connected to hydraulic 
cylinders in a device such as a scissors lifts fail. 
Failure of a hydraulic input hose results in a sudden 
pressure loss wherein hydraulic fluid can rapidly flow from 
the hydraulic cylinder allowing the scissors lift collapse. 
This can, of course, result in injury to personnel and in 
equipment damage. In order to minimize the chance of a hydraulically 
powered, lift device collapsing, hydraulic fuses are utilized 
which prevent back flow through hydraulic lines upon 
a loss of pressure. In the case of a lift, such as a 
scissors lift, the hydraulic fuse is moved to a blocking 
position by the weight of the raised lift which pushes the 
piston in the hydraulic cylinder used to accomplish the 
lift back into the cylinder. This ejects fluid from the 
cylinder moving the fuse to block flow of hydraulic fluid 
out of the cylinder.  Once the hydraulic system is blocked, the hydraulic 
lift cannot collapse. This leaves the operator suspended 
above the ground. In order to lower the operator, the 
system is pumped. This requires that a separate valve be 
connected to the hydraulic line. It is a feature of the present invention to provide, 
in hydraulic systems, a relief valve which incorporates a 
hydraulic fuse in combination with the relief valve. In view of this feature and other features, the present 
invention contemplates a relief valve, useful in hydraulic 
systems, wherein the relief valve comprises a valve 
seat and a first spring having a first spring force for 
urging the valve seat in a first direction. Upon the 
application of a first fluid pressure having a force greater 
than the first spring force, the valve seat is moved in 
a direction opposite the first direction. A second spring 
is provided having a second spring force less than the 
first spring force to bias a fuse away from the valve. The 
fuse is urged toward the valve seat upon application of a 
second fluid pressure having a force greater than the 
second spring force. This closes the valve. Upon 
application of a fluid pressure greater than the first 
fluid pressure, the valve seat and fuse disengage to allow 
passage of hydraulic fluid

A relief valve useful in a hydraulic lift system for preventing collapse of 
a hydraulic lift, wherein the system includes a hydraulic cylinder with a piston 

therein, the hydraulic cylinder being connected to a first line for pressurizing the 
cylinder and a second line for exhausting the cylinder, wherein a relief valve (60) 

is connected between the second line and the hydraulic cylinder, the improvement 
comprising: 

   a valve seat (105) biased in a first direction by a first spring (96) having a 
first spring force applied in a first direction; 

   a fuse (111) aligned with the valve seat (105) and being biased away from 
the valve seat by a second spring (120) having a spring force less than the first 

spring force; 
   means (118) for allowing a fluid pressure having a force less than the 

second spring force to bypass the fuse (111); 
   means (104) for seating the fuse (111) with the valve seat (105) when the 

fluid pressure exceeds the force of the second spring means; and

another upon a pressure having a force greater than the first spring force being 
applied against the valve seat in a second direction opposite the direction of the 

first spring force.
