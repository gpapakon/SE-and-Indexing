<ABSTRACT>
A purified xylanase derived from 
B. Pumilus
 PRL B12 is 
disclosed. This xylanase is efficient for use in the 

biobleaching of wood pulp, permitting a strong reduction in the 
quantity of chlorine used and AOX compounds produced in classical 

and ECF wood pulp bleaching sequences as well as the quantity of 
ozone used in TCF sequences. The gene coding for the xylanase 

was isolated and purified and used to construct an expression 
vector therefor. A recombinant host strain of 
B. licheniformis
 
is also disclosed which is efficient for expressing heterologous 

enzymes, including the xylanase when transformed by the 
expression vector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heterologous enzymes
produced by recombinant strains of Bacillus licheniformis and, in
particular, to a xylanase derived from Bacillus pumilus PRL B12
which is efficient for use in the biobleaching of lignocellulosic
pulp, expression vectors and recombinant Bacillus licheniformis
hosts for the expression of the xylanase, and the use of the
xylanase in the biobleaching of lignocellulosic pulp.A common objective in the manufacture of products (such as
paper products) from lignocellulosic pulps is to provide a pulp
from which the product produced has as high a final brightness as
is possible. A major factor that limits such final brightness is
the quantity of lignin present in the pulp.Lignin in such lignocellulosic pulps is mostly bound up with
hemicellulose in a lignocellulosic complex. A major interface
between the lignin and the remainder of the carbohydrates of the
lignocellulosic complex is formed by xylan (1,4-Î²-D-xylan) which
is bonded thereto. To remove the lignin from the pulp, these
bonds must first be broken.Conventionally, lignocellulosic pulps, such as wood pulp,
are delignified by being chemically-cooked. While being extremely
useful for its purposes, (up to ninety-five per cent of the
lignin present may be removed therefrom by such chemical-cooking),
chemical-cooking cannot, by itself, reach higher levels
of delignification without severly attacking the carbohydrates in
the pulp. Thus, cooking must be stopped before the loss of
carbohydrates becomes too important and before further delignification
has occurred. This remaining lignin imparts a brown color
to the cellulosic fibers in the pulp, thereby preventing the
product fabricated therefrom from having as high a final
brightness as possible. To obtain further delignification of the pulp after
chemical-cooking, various "bleaching" sequences are used.
Conventionally, such bleaching sequences include "Classical" (or
conventional) bleaching sequences and Elemental Chlorine Free
bleaching sequences. These bleaching sequences include a delignification
stage followed by a series of bleaching stages. In
the delignification stage, the pulp is first subjected to a
chlorine and/or chlorine dioxide treatment step, usually followed
by an alkaline extraction step.While being effective for facilitating the removal ("delignification")
of substantial quantities of lignin from the
chemically-cooked pulp, treatment of the pulp nonetheless suffers
from drawbacks. Perhaps the most troublesome of these drawbacks
(especially in
