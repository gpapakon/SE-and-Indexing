<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymerization of ring-strained
cyclic olefins by means of a two
part catalyst which comprises a transition metal-containing
compound. The polymerized composition is
useful to provide molded articles, elastomers,
dielectric supports, ionophoric or biologically active
materials, and composite materials.It is known in the art that polymerization of
cyclic olefins provides unsaturated polymers which were
disclosed to be useful, for example, as molded
articles.Polymerization of cyclic olefins via the so-called
olefin metathesis reaction has been widely investigated
since the first description appeared in 1960. Ivin has
reviewed the work in this field (K. J. Ivin,
"Cycloalkenes and Bicycloalkenes," Chapter 3 in K. J.
Ivin, T. Saegusa, eds. Ring-Opening Polymerization,
Vol. 1, Elsevier: London, 1984, 121-183). Polymers
produced via olefin metathesis of cyclic olefins
still contain

bonds, one for each monomer unit,
and are thus distinct from polymers prepared using free
radical or Ziegler-type catalysts, which produce
saturated hydrocarbon polymers, and polymers prepared
using ring-opening polymerizations of cationically
sensitive monomers such as epoxides, in which
heteroatoms are present and are involved in the
polymerization chemistry by cleavage of a heteroatom-carbon
bond. As this review and many patents teach, certain
transition metal compounds can be used to catalyze
olefin metathesis polymerization of cyclic olefins.
Molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), and rhenium (Re),
incorporated in either inorganic or organometallic
compounds, have most often been employed. Catalysts
based on transition metals from Periodic Groups 4, 5,
8, and 9 are also known. Heterogeneous catalysts have
been taught, typically supported on alumina or silica.
Most useful, however, are homogeneous or non-supported
catalysts. The most frequently used homogeneous
catalysts are based on high oxidation state compounds
of Mo or W, such as WCl6, WOCl4 or MoCl6. Reaction
products of these with phenolic compounds are also
taught. Cocatalysts, usually containing an alkyl group
bonded to a non-transition metal, are often used in
combination with these, and cocatalysts are presumed to
transfer at least one alkyl group to the transition
metal. Most frequently, the cocatalysts are based on
aluminum (Al), but alkyls of zinc, tin and other
Group 14 metals, Group 1 metals (such as lithium), and
Group 2 metals (such as magnesium) are also employed.
Cocatalysts which are halogen-containing Lewis acids
such as AlCl3 or sources
