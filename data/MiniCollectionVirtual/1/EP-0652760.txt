<DESCRIPTION>
 THERAPEUTIC METHODS USING CAESIUM IONSThis invention relates to the treatment of a wide variety of distressing disorders that occur in both man and animals and to compositions and preparations for use in such treatment. As used herein, the term 'patient' includes within its scope both humans and animals.The invention finds particular application in the treatment of many seemingly unrelated complaints that cause huge health losses to individuals and huge financial losses to society. Some important applications of the present invention which have been noted to date include:1) Relief of the pain in an extremely wide range of painful musculoskeletal and neural disorders.2) The suppressing or relieving of any type of cough as well as most of the symptoms of hay fever. This includes such important afflictions as asthma and the common cold.3) Relief from croup attack in children.4) Relief from itching of the skin and related complaints such as those from eczema and other skin diseases or disorders.5) Relief from the irritation resulting from ulcers, and also rapid healing of persistent, long-term leg ulcers.6) Relief from local pain obtained by using subcutaneous injections.7) Use as an anaesthetic.The above list of therapeutic uses is not a limiting list, but simply some of the more important or more dramatic uses of this invention. The current conventional Western medical practice for management of arthritis and other soft tissue injuries includes the administration of steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by topical application, orally or by injection into the affected areas of the patient.Steroids, such as the corticosteroids, often have undesirable side effects such as the promotion of peptic ulcers, increased susceptibility toSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

infection, mental irritability, nervousness, obesity, muscular weakness, osteoporosis, diabetes, and adrenal insufficiency which, in some cases, may cause the patient to collapse.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs generally have a less debilitating effect on patients. However, they are not without side effects. Stomach disorders, gastric pain, diarrhoea, dizziness or light headiness, stomach or duodenal ulcers and long term blood loss have all been reported in patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Where the anti-inflammatory drugs have been administered topically, further difficulties such as skin irritation, odor and staining may also be experienced.Most commercially available topical preparations for the treatment of
