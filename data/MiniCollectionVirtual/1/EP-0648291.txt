<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a block (1) having lateral spacers (12, 13) to form uniform seams (22). The mating surfaces (4) of the spacers (12, 13) are shaped for the mating fit of an adjacent block in a row (19) of blocks in such a way that they take the same course with paired, complementary spacers (12, 13) of adjacent block sides (9, 11) that they mesh. This provides a block which, owing to the shape of its spacers, is secured against laterally parallel movement in the row (19).

Block for inserting into a block bond (19, 21) which can be laid in a surface 
covering lattice-like grid (R) and has lateral spacers (3), and which has a 

mating surface (4) for positive fit with the mating surface (4) of a spacer (3) of 
an adjoining block, whereby the mating surface (4) of the spacer (3) has a 

three-dimensional structure (5 to 7) for positive interlocking with the 
complementary mating surface (4) of a spacer (3) of an adjoining block , 

characterised in that the mating surfaces (4) of all spacers on a block have a 
stepped or graduated outer contour, whereby the stepping of the outer contour 

of the spacer (3) viewed from above is in the same direction all the way around 
the block. 
Block according to claim 1, characterised in that there are two or more spacers 
(12, 17) on one side of a block (9) and there are the same number of spacers 

(16, 13) at the same distance (d) from one another on a side (11) that is 
complementary to said block side (9). 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the block 
(1) is designed so that it can cover a whole number of grid elements. 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the block 
(1) apart from the spacers (3) has the outline of a parallelogram. 
Block according to claim 1, characterised in that the spacers (12, 13) of two 
opposite side walls (9, 11) to be placed next to one another are arranged at the 

same height (h) in relation to the length of their side walls (9, 11). 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that two or 
more spacers (12, 17) on one side (9) have the same mating surfaces (4), 

whereby the distance (d) of these mating surfaces along the side wall is equal 
to the length (L
R
) of a grid element divided by the number of spacers (12, 17) 
per grid element.  

 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that two 
opposite side walls (9, 11) are designed to be rotationally symmetrical in 

respect of a 180° rotation of the block (1). 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the block 
(1) is rectangular. 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that on 
adjoining block sides identical spacers are provided to form seams of equal 

width. 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the block 
(1) is quadratic and rotationally symmetrical in respect of rotation about 90°. 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
mating surfaces (4) of the spacers (3) are designed so that a block (25) can be 

inserted into a bond (21) laid only partly along two crossing grid lines (R) by 
displacement from the side (W) at the same time with two adjoining block sides 

(8, 9). 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that each 
stepped or graduated mating surface (4) has two roughly parallel stepped parts 

(5, 6) at a distance from the side walls, which are connected by a diagonal 
even surface (7) or a surface (7) perpendicular to the side surface, whereby the 

diagonal surface (7) is preferably inclined so that on rotating the outer edges of 
the block in a specific direction all incline either upwards or downwards with 

respect to their block side wall. 
Block according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
spacer (3) oversteps the middle line (23) of the seam (22) or the grid line (R) 

when laid, whereby the middle line divides the non-side parallel region (7) of  
 

the mating surface (4) of the spacer (3) or halves it in height perpendicular to 
the side wall. 
Block according to claim 12, characterised in that each spacer (3) is fitted like a 
block onto the side surface (8 to 11) of the block (2) with seam areas (39, 40) 

perpendicular or diagonal to the side surface, whereby the seam areas form the 
connection with the stepped areas (5, 6). 
Block according to claim 12 or 14, characterised in that the spacers (3) are 
flush with the lower edge (42) of the block (2) and are at a distance (a) from the 

upper peripheral edge (41) of the block, whereby (a) is 1/5 of the block height 
(H).
