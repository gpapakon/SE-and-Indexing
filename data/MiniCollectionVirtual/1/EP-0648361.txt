<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a gaming machine with at least one display area (2) for a number of game symbols (3) which, after the player has pressed a start button (4) to start the game, are selected under the control of a computing unit (5) from a multitude of predetermined symbols and presented at positions in the display area (2) for the player to view. The invention calls for the gaming machine (1) to have, preferably in the display area (2), at least one chance-display zone (7, 7') in which the computing unit (5), optionally on actuation of a request unit (14), e.g. a request button, by the player, displays possible and/or increased and/or best-possible win chances, and/or instructions for determining them, which are available for the next game or which, on removal of one or more of the game symbols or game-symbol combinations presented for the next game, apply or could possibly be achieved in the next game.
