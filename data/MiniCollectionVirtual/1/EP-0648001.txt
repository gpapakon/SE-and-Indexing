<ABSTRACT>
An access flooring module (2) for housing electrical 
sockets, comprises an inner assembly (6) having a cover 

(14) and pivotally mounted within an outer frame (54) so 
that the inner assembly is movable between a closed 

position and an open position in which the cover permits 
access to the electrical sockets. The outer frame (54) 

has a shoulder (50) extending thereabout, and the cover 
(14) has an arcuate surface (48) adjacent the pivot (46) 

and slidably engaging with the shoulder (50) of the outer 
frame, so that a force applied to the cover (14) is 

distributed to the outer frame (54) through the arcuate 
surface (48) of the cover and forces are not distributed 

through the pivot (46).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an access flooring 
module in which electrical power and signal cables 
are made available to the user. As the use or modular offices increases, it is 
essential that power and signal cables be delivered to 
these offices in a manner which will not interfere with 
the daily operations of the personnel who occupy the 
offices. Consequently, the use of access flooring is 
becoming widespread. Access flooring allows the power and signal cables 
to be placed beneath the floor in a position which will 
not interfere with the placement of walls or furniture. 
The use of access flooring also allows the power and 
signal cables to be moved as the modular offices are 
moved. In order for the power and signal cables to be 
utilized, the cables are currently terminated in access 
flooring modules. These access flooring modules 
provide the end user or operator with the means to 
connect his office equipment to the power and signal 
cables required for the proper operation thereof. There are many access flooring modules currently 
available in the market. However, the access flooring 
modules available have problems associated therewith, 
which make them difficult to use and service. A typical access flooring module has a cover which 
is pivoted to an open position to reveal the various 
power and signal components which are terminated 
therein. One such module is shown in US-A-3 972 579. This  
 
electrical device has pivot means which cause the 
electrical receptacle to be positioned in the same plane as 
the floor when the cover is moved to the open position. 
This allows the operator to more easily access the 
electrical receptacle, thereby reducing the possibility of 
mis-insertion of the plug into the receptacle. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved construction of access flooring module or 
electrical assembly for use in housing electrical sockets 
in access flooring. The invention consists in an electrical assembly for 
housing electrical sockets, in which an inner assembly 
having a cover is disposed within an outer frame and pivot 
means is provided between the inner assembly and the outer 
frame to permit the inner assembly to move relatively to 
the outer frame between a closed position and an open 
position in which the cover permits access to the 
electrical sockets, characterised in that the outer frame 
includes a shoulder extending thereabout, and the cover 
has an arcuate surface disposed adjacent the pivot means 
and slidably engageable with

<CLAIMS>
An electrical assembly for housing electrical sockets, 
in which an inner assembly (6) having a cover (14) is 

disposed within an outer frame (54) and pivot means (46,47) 
is provided between the inner assembly and the outer frame 

to permit the inner assembly to move relatively to the 
outer frame between a closed position and an open position 

in which the cover permits access to the electrical 
sockets, characterised in that the outer frame (54) 

includes a shoulder (50) extending thereabout, and the 
cover (14) has an arcuate surface (48) disposed adjacent 

the pivot means (46) and slidably engageable with the 
shoulder (50) of the outer frame, whereby a force applied 

to the cover (14) is distributed to the outer frame (54) 
through the arcuate surface (48) of the cover and the pivot 

means will not have forces distributed therethrough. 
An electrical assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the pivot means comprise pivot projections (46) which 

extend from the inner assembly (6) and slots (47) disposed 
in the outer frame (54), said slots (47) being engaged by 

the pivot projections and being configured to permit the 
pivot projections to be movable in a direction which is 

substantially parallel to the longitudinal axes of the 
slots. 
An electrical assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
including a latch (86) pivotally mounted on the cover (14) 

for retaining the inner assembly (6) in its closed 
position, said pivotal mounting comprising pivot 

projections (94) engaged in pivot openings (96) having an 
elongate configuration, whereby the latch (86) is movable 

relatively to the cover in a direction substantially  
 

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pivot 
projections (94), and wherein resilient means (98) engages 

with the latch (86) and urges the latch about the pivot 
projections (94) in an opening direction, whereby as the 

latch (86) is moved in a direction which is substantially 
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pivot 

projections (94), the resilient means (98) cooperates with 
the latch to move the latch between a closed and an open 

position and release the latch. 
An electrical assembly as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the latch (86) is engageable under a holding surface (102) 

of the outer frame (54) in order to retain the inner 
assembly (6) in its closed position, and wherein the 

resilient means (98) is arranged also to urge the latch 
towards said holding surface, whereby when the inner 

assembly is returned from its open to its closed position, 
the latch (86) is engageable with the outer frame (54) 

above the holding surface (102) to provide an opening via 
which wires may extend into the electrical assembly when 

the inner assembly is in its closed position.
