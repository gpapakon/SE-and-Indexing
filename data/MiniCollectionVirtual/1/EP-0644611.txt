<ABSTRACT>
A socket (100) for the temporary mounting of an electric 
part such as an IC package (130) for burn-in testing and the like 

is shown in which a plurality of contact elements (10, 10') are 
mounted in the socket each having a stationary part (10a), a 

spring cantilever arm part (10b) and a contact edge part (10e). 
The contact elements (10, 10') are mounted so that the leads 

(130a) of an IC package (130) are each received on a respective 
contact edge part (10e). When the cover (102) of the socket is 

closed, wall member (105a) engages the top portion of the leads 
(130a) and exerts a generally vertical downward force on the 

contact edges (10e) causing them to be depressed to effect 
electrical connection between leads (130a) and respective contact 

elements (10, 10').

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrical sockets which 
mount an electrical part having a plurality of leads, such as an 
IC package, for burn-in testing or the like of the electrical 
part and more specifically to such sockets which readily mount 
and dismount an electrical part and which have an improved 
contact system for making electrical engagement with the leads of 
the electrical part. It is conventional in manufacturing IC packages comprising a 
plastic sealed semiconductor integrated circuit chip (also 
hereinafter referred to as an IC chip) to subject the packages to 
a type of reliability test which is called a burn-in test prior 
to shipment in order to separate the packages into groups of 
satisfactory and unsatisfactory products. The burn-in test is 
for the purpose of placing an IC package that has passed a 
functional test in an oven and energizing the same for a given 
period of time at an elevated temperature, such as 120Â° 
centigrade, under an electrical source which is approximately 20% 
higher than the rated value. Those IC packages which fail the 
burn-in test are discarded as unsatisfactory products and only 
those others which continue to function in a normal fashion are 
shipped out as satisfactory products. An example of a prior art socket used for mounting IC 
packages for burn-in testing is shown in Figures 1 and 2. As 
seen in Figure 1, the socket comprises a base 100 which serves as 
the main socket body to be fixed on a printed circuit substrate  
 
(not shown in the drawings) and a cover 102 hingedly mounted 
thereon. Hinge 104, having a coil spring 103, is disposed on one 
side of base 100 with bosses 106 of hinge 104 formed integrally 
on one side of the cover. Cover 102 is pivotable in a direction 
indicated by an arrow marked J about shaft 108. In Figure 2, a rotatable shaft 120 is journaled on the 
opposite side of cover 102 and mounts thereon a latch 122 for 
holding cover 102 in a closed state covering base 100. As hook 
122a of latch 122 engages with a ledge 100a formed on the 
opposite side of base 100, cover 102 is closed on the upper 
surface of base 100. A lever 124 which is integral with latch 
122 extends in the opposite direction and, as lever 124 is 
rotated in opposition to a coil spring 126, latch 122 is 
disengaged from ledge 100a of base 100, thereby making it 
possible for cover 102 to be opened. The upper surface of base 100 is formed in such a way that 
an IC package 130 of the QFP type (Quad in line Flat Package) may 
be mounted at the IC

<CLAIMS>
A socket comprising a body (100) which includes a 
force applying member (105a), a plurality of contact 

elements (10) mounted in a row in the body, the contact 
elements (10) being spaced from one another by a selected 

pitch, the contact elements (10) each having a fixed 
portion (10a) and having a cantilever arm (10b) extending 

from the fixed portion, the arm having a contact engaging 
edge (10e) at a free distal end movable about a fulcrum 

(F), the contact engaging edge (10e) of the free distal end 
having an at rest position disposed above a horizontal 

imaginary line (HL) passing through the fulcrum (F), the 
force applying member (105a) being movable from a first 

position in which the free distal ends are in the at rest 
position to a second position in which the force applying 

member (105a) presses down on an electrical part to be 
mounted in the socket to cause leads extending from the 

part to engage the contact engaging edges (10e) at the free 
distal ends so that they are depressed downwardly to cause 

each contact engaging edge (10e) of the free distal ends to 
move from a position (Ps) above said imaginary line (HL) to 

a position (PE) below the said imaginary line (HL), whereby 
the leads extending from the electrical part when mounted 

in the socket have each lead received on a respective 
contact engaging edge (10e) of a free distal end and will 

be rubbed by the contact engaging edges (10e) in alternate 
opposed directions when the force applying member moves 

from the first to the second position. 
A socket according to claim 1 in which the contact 
engaging edge (10e) at its at rest position is disposed a 

selected distance (delta yl) above the imaginary line (HL) 
which is equal to the distance (delta y2) between the 

imaginary line (HL) and the contact engaging edge (10e) 
when the force applying member is at the second position.  

 
A socket according to claim 1 or claim 2 further 
including a cover (102) pivotably mounted on the body (100) 

and the force applying member (105a) extends downwardly 
from the cover. 
A socket according to claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3 in 
which the contact engaging edge (10e) extends upwardly from 

the free distal end of each contact element (10). 
A socket according to any one of claims 1 to 4 in 
which the cantilever arm (10b) extends generally in a 

straight line. 
A socket according any one of claims 1 to 4 in which 
the cantilever arm (10b) includes a curved portion (10g).
