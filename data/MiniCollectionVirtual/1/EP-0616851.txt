<ABSTRACT>
The document or paper shredder possesses a housing (1, 1b, 1c) which is preferably enclosed on all sides and a supporting frame (5, 5a, 5b), arranged below the cutting mechanism (not shown) located in the top part of the housing, for a bag (6) to collect the shredded material, which bag is supported by guides (4) arranged on the housing inner walls (1b) of the document shredder so as to be capable of being moved in and out and can be drawn fully out in order to change the bag (6). The supporting frame (5) for the shredded material bag (6) is placed together with the latter loosely on the guide rails (4) which can be moved out. The guide rails (4) further possess stop elements (7, 7a), on the one hand to lock the supporting frame (5) on the guide rails (4) against horizontal displaceability and on the other hand, in connection with the front ring (5b), to prevent a compressive force on the inside of the housing door (2) producing undesired opening.

<CLAIMS>
File or document shredder with a housing substructure, which is closed all round
and openable by a door at the front, and a support frame, which is arranged in the housing

substructure below the cutting mechanism, for a bag which receives the comminuted
material and is supported to be horizontally movable in and out by angled guide rails

arranged at the lateral housing inner walls of the document shredder and which is
withdrawable completely out of the housing substructure for exchange of the bag,

characterised by the following features:

a. the support frame (5, 5a) for the bag (6) for cut stock is placed together with the
bag loosely on the lateral guide rails able to be moved out;
b. the guide rails (4) have abutment elements (7, 7a) at the front which serve for
locking the support frame (5, 5a) and which when the housing front door (2) is

closed lie between the support frame (5, 5a) and the door inner side (2a);
c. the support frame (5) for the bag (6) for cut stock has approximately centrally at its
front cross-connection (5a) a yoke-shaped abutment (5b) directed towards the

housing base (1e).
File shredder according to claim 1, characterised thereby that at least one
abutment element (7) at the head end is disposed to extend transversely at the guide rails

(4, 4a) lying on the door hinge side (3, 3a) and its projecting free end (7a) lies behind the
pivot axis (3a) of the door hinge (3) at the door inner side (2a) when the housing front door

(2) is closed.
File shredder according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the yoke-shaped
abutment (5b) is constructed as a U-shaped closed frame at the base, extends slightly

inwards relative to the interior (1') of the housing (1) and has in the region of the front
cross-connection (5a) of the support frame (5) an additional cross web (5c) lying at a

spacing below the latter.
