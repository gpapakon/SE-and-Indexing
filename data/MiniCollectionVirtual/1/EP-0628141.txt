<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for joining together toothed belt elements (16, 20). The device includes two flat parts (12, 24) which are mutually joined through the medium of a hinge-forming web-part (26). At least one flat part (24) has engagement elements (30, 32) for engagement with corresponding recesses in the belt elements (16, 20), and snap-in locking means (36, 38, 40, 42) are provided for locking the flat parts (12, 24) together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device which is 
intended for joining together belt elements, preferably 
toothed belt elements and which comprises a first flat 
part having a surface for abutment with one side of an 
end-part of a first belt element and a surface for 
abutment with the one side of an end-part of a second 
belt element, and further comprises a second flat part 
having a surface for abutment with the other side of the 
end-part of the first belt element and a surface for 
abutment with the other side of the end-part of the 
second belt element. Toothed belt elements have previously been joined together 
with the aid of butt-straps or plates of particular 
configuration which are overlapped on mutually 
adjacent end-parts of the toothed belts and the ends of 
the toothed belts securely clamped between the straps or 
plates and fixed with the aid of screws. According to 
another method, the ends of the belts are glued together, 
one end of the belt being placed in a recess in the 
other end of the belt. These belt joining methods are 
work-demanding and time-consuming and therewith expensive. An object of the present invention is to provide a belt-joining 
device which will enable two toothed belt elements 
to be joined together quickly and simply without 
the use of additional fastener means. This object is achieved with a belt-joining device of 
the aforedescribed kind which is characterized in that 
the two flat parts are mutually joined by a hinge which 
permits one flat part to be folded over the other; in 
that in each case one of these belt abutment surfaces of  
 
the flat parts which oppose one another subsequent to 
folding said flat parts presents at least one outwardly 
projecting engagement element whose cross-section corresponds 
generally to the cross-section of a recess in 
respective ends of the belt elements; and in that the 
two flat parts are provided with coacting snap-lock 
means which function to mutually lock said flat parts 
and hold the end-parts of the belt elements firmly 
clamped between the flat parts with the engagement 
elements inserted in respective recesses. This construction 
of an inventive belt-joining device enables the 
belt ends to be readily placed on one flat part and the 
other flat part then folded over the belt ends with 
respective engagement elements moved into engagement 
with associated recesses in the belt ends, said snap-lock 
means being caused to mutually lock the flat parts 
with the belt ends clamped therebetween, without the 
need
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for joining together belt elements 
(16, 20), preferably toothed belt elements, comprising a 

first flat part (12) having a surface (14) for abutment 
with one side of one end-part of a first belt element 

(16) and having a surface (18) for abutment with one 
side of one end-part of a second belt element (20), and 

further comprising a second flat part (24) having a 
surface for abutment with the other side of the end-part 

of the first belt element (16) and a surface for abutment 
with the other side of the end-part of the second 

belt element (20), 
characterized
 in that 
the two flat parts (12, 24) are preferably mutually 

connected by a hinge (26) such as to allow one flat part 
(24) to be folded over the other flat part (12); in that 

in each case subsequent to folding said flat parts one 
of the opposing belt abutment surfaces of said flat 

parts will present at least one outwardly projecting 
engagement element (30, 32) whose cross-sectional shape 

corresponds generally to the cross-sectional shape of a 
recess in the end of respective belt elements; and in 

that the two flat parts (12, 24) are provided with 
coacting snap-lock means (36, 38, 40) for mutually 

locking the flat parts and holding the end-parts of the 
belt elements (16, 20) firmly clamped between said flat 

parts with the engagement elements (30, 32) inserted in 
respective recesses. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the hinge has the form of a 

thinned web-part (26) between the flat parts (12, 24). 
A device according to Claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that the web-part (26) includes a belt 

element throughlet opening (28).  
 
A device according to any one of Claims 1-3, 

characterized
 in that an abutment element 
(22) extends transversely across one flat part (12), 

wherein one side of the abutment element forms an abutment 
surface for the end-edge of one belt element (16) 

whereas the other side of said abutment element forms an 
abutment surface for the end-edge of the other belt 

element (20). 
A device according to any one of Claims 1-4, 

characterized
 in that the engagement elements 
(30, 32) for the belt elements (16, 20) have the 

form of rack teeth. 
A device according to any one of Claims 1-5, 

characterized
 in that the engagement elements 
(30, 32) have mutually different lengths. 
A device according to any one of Claims 4-6, 

characterized
 in that the snap-lock means 
have the form of two projections (36) which are formed 

on one flat part (24) and which are intended to be 
inserted in corresponding recesses (38) in the other 

flat part (12), wherein outwardly projecting members 
(40) on one side of the abutment element (22) are intended 

to snap into corresponding apertures (35) in the 
projections (36). 
A device according to any one of Claims 1-7, 

characterized
 in that the device is a one-piece 
structure preferably made of plastic material.
