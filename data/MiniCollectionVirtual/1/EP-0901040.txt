<ABSTRACT>
A substantially light-insensitive monosheet recording material
comprising a support and a thermosensitive element containing a

substantially light-insensitive organic silver salt, an organic
reducing agent therefor in thermal working relationship therewith

and a binder, characterized in that the thermosensitive element
further contains an unsaturated carbocyclic or heterocyclic

stabilizer compound substituted with a -SA group where A is
hydrogen, a counterion to compensate the negative charge of the

thiolate group or a group forming a symmetrical or an asymmetrical
disulfide and the recording material is capable of producing prints

with a numerical gradation value defined as the quotient of the
fraction (2.5 - 0.1)/(E
2.5
 - E
0.1
) greater than 2.3 , where E
2.5
 is the
energy in Joule applied in a dot area of 87 µm x 87 µm of the

imaging layer that produces an optical density value of 2.5, and E
0.1

is the energy in Joule applied in a dot area of the imaging layer
material that produces an optical density value of 0.1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substantially light-insensitive
thermographic recording material suitable for thermal
development. In particular, it concerns improvements in
stabilization thereof.Thermal imaging or thermography is a recording process wherein
images are generated by the use of imagewise modulated thermal
energy. A survey of "direct thermal" imaging methods is given e.g.
in the book "Imaging Systems" by Kurt I. Jacobson-Ralph E. Jacobson,
The Focal Press - London and New York (1976), Chapter VII under the
heading "7.1 Thermography". Direct thermal thermography is
concerned with materials which are substantially not photosensitive,
but are sensitive to heat or thermosensitive. Imagewise applied
heat is sufficient to bring about a visible change in a
thermosensitive imaging material.WO 94/16361 discloses a multilayer heat-sensitive material for
direct thermal recording for which no intermediate drying of organic
noble metal salts is necessary and which is coatable from aqueous
dispersions. This material comprises: a colour-forming amount of
finely divided, solid colourless noble metal or iron salt of an
organic acid distributed in a carrier composition; a color-developing
amount of a cyclic or aromatic organic reducing agent,
which at thermal copy and printing temperatures is capable of a
colour-forming reaction with the noble metal or iron salt; and an
image toning agent; characterized in that (a) the carrier
composition comprises a substantially water-soluble polymeric
carrier and a dispersing agent for the noble metal or iron salt and
(b) the material comprises a protective overcoating layer for the
colour-forming layer. This patent application also discloses that
suitable antifoggants for use in the invention are well-known
photographic antifoggants such as 2-mercaptobenzo-triazole,
chromate, oxalate, carbonate, benzotriazole (BZT), 5-methylbenzotriazole,
5,6-dimethylbenzotriazole, 5-bromobenzotriazole, 5-chlorobenzo-triazole,
5-nitrobenzotriazole, 4-nitro-6-chlorobenzotriazole,
5-nitro-6-chlorobenzotriazole, 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,3,3a,7-tetraazaindene,
benzimidazole, 2-methylbenzimidazole, 5-nitrobenzimidazole, 
1-phenyl-5-mercaptotetrazole (PMT), 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole,
2-mercaptobenzoxazole, 2-mercaptothiazoline,
2-mercapto-4-methyl-6,6'-dimethylpyrimidine, 1-ethyl-2-mercapto-5-amino-1,3,4-triazole,
1-ethyl-5-mercapto-1,2,3,4-tetrazole, 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole,
2-mercapto-5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole,
dimethyldithiocarbamate, and
