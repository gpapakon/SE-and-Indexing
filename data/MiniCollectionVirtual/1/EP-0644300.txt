<ABSTRACT>
Water damage in a multi-layered building floor is eliminated by a method which makes it possible to monitor the drying. The method uses a neutron probe, with the aid of which the moisture content is determined. As a reference value, a measured value is taken on a floor of the same structure, but without any water damage. In the damaged room, at least all the room corners are then measured. The corner with the highest measured value is selected as monitoring point. During the drying process then beginning, regular measurements are taken again at said monitoring point. When the reference value has almost been reached, then the drying is interrupted. This method permits specific use of the drying implements at the damaged locations. In addition, the period of time for the repair work is shortened.

A method for optimising and controlling a drying process of
water damage in a multi-layered building floor, characterised in

that

a) by way of a neutron probe in a room without damage and with
the same multi-layered building floor a reference signal is

evaluated,
b) that thereafter in a room with water damage at least all room

corners are measured and the corner with the highest reading is
defined as a monitoring point,
c) whereupon the drying process is carried out whilst continuing
the measurement in dampest corner in temporally roughly equal

intervals,
d) until the value here has fallen to approximately 10% within
the reference value of the dry room or there is effected no more

significant drying,
e) whereupon the drying is stopped.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
readings evaluated under point b) are provided with a material-dependent

index and the measuring location with the highest,
index-corrected reading is defined as a monitoring point,

whereupon the measurement according to point c) is continued at
least at the reading location selected as the monitoring point. 
A method according to one of the claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that at at least one of the measuring points

several measurements are carried out and their statistical mean
is calculated, wherein values which lie outside a defined scatter

reading are disregarded.
A method according to one of the claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that in the room with water damage a network

with measuring points is fixed and on account of the readings at
the various measuring points a damage schema is drawn up.
A method according to claim 4, characterised in that in the
periphery about the dampest corner at the locations which are

still dry next to this there are incorporated drying bores.
A method according to one of the claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that in the dampest room corner there is

incorporated a drying bore.
A method according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that on account of the measurements in the region of the dampest

room corner a measuring curve depending on time is drawn up.
The application of the method according to one of the claims
1 or 2, characterised in that it is applied to floating building

floors.
