<ABSTRACT>
A device for locating submunitions within the casing of a projectile, consisting of evenly angularly spaced bars (9) each comprising a bearing surface (10) for engaging the inside of the casing (3) and two supporting surfaces (11a, 11b) for engaging at least two adjacent submunitions (2). The device is characterised in that each bar is divided into at least two bar portions (9a, 9b) in mutual contact at at least one sloping guide surface (30) whereby a relative sliding movement of each bar moves the two supporting surfaces (11a, 11b) away from each other in such a way as to eliminate the radial clearance between the submunitions (2) arranged within the casing (3). The device is suitable for locating anti-tank bomblets within an artillery carrier shell.

A shimming device for sub-munitions (2) inside the 
casing (3) of a projectile (1) which is formed of bars (9) 

evenly spaced angularly, each bar incorporating a bearing 
surface (10) intended to come into contact with an inner 

surface of the casing (3) and two holding surfaces (11a, 
llb) intended to come into contact with at least two 

adjacent sub-munitions (2), each bar being divided into at 
least two half-bars (9a, 9b) which are in mutual contact 

at at least one contact surface (20), a device 

characterized in that
 the contact surface (20) is inclined 
so as to form a guiding surface which, by relative sliding 

of each half-bar, enables the two holding surfaces (11a, 
llb) to be spread out thereby taking up the radial play 

when the sub-munitions (2) are installed in the casing 
(3). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each half-bar is formed by assembling at least two 

identical block elements (12), each block element 
incorporating a bearing surface (10), a holding surface 

(11) and a guiding surface (20). 
A device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the block elements (12) forming the half-bars are 

assembled using plugs (16) and holes (17) carried on their 
end surfaces (15, 14). 
A device according to one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the block elements (12) are 

identical on the two half-bars. 
A device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that each block (12) carries a pin (22) arranged on its 

guiding surface (20), this pin being intended to go into a 
housing (23) carried by the guiding surface of another 

block, the pins and housings allowing the two half-bars 
(9a, 9b) to be assembled in a relative position such that 

there is a minimal distance between the holding surfaces 
(lla, 11b) of the bar (9) thus formed.  

 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the bars (9) are made of a plastic 

material.
