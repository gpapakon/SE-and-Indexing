<ABSTRACT>
A hollow winding bobbin base (26) is 
constructed of a material having a relatively low 

thermal coefficient of expansion (e.g., quartz) and has 
a pair of flanges (32) slidably located on the ends. A 

metal tube (24) is received within the base (26) and 
has annular springs (40) on its ends urging the flanges 

(32) toward each other. An elastomer baselayer (30) is 
fitted onto the outer surface of the base (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
bobbin on which a length of an optical fiber is wound, 
and, more particularly, to such a bobbin which is 
compliant in order to reduce the possibility of 
inducing tension or microbending into the fiber. An optical fiber as used in 
telecommunications, for example, consists of a quartz 
core serving as the light guide that is surrounded by a 
polymer ("buffer") coating. When the fiber is wound 
into a coil on a bobbin the resulting pack exhibits a 
highly polytropic behavior; axial deformation due to 
temperature and water absorption into the buffer is 
relatively large while radial deformation is relatively 
small due to the reinforcement effect provided by the 
quartz fiber core. A conventional bobbin or other 
structure on which the fiber is wound produces a 
restriction in the axial deformation and any change in 
buffer bulk will cause undesirable fiber strain. A quartz fiber core has a relatively high 
elastic modulus (at least several orders of magnitude 
greater than that of the buffer). The springs formed 
by long hoops or loops of the core on a wound pack are  
 
much more compliant than the interleaved springs formed 
by the comparatively thin buffer coating. As a result, 
any loads imposed on the fiber pack by the winding of 
overlying layers or the expansion of the buffer coating 
are reacted by changes in the quartz core hoop tension. An example of undesirable behavior is what 
occurs during temperature cycling of dispensers for an 
optical fiber wound pack as used in certain guided 
missiles, for example. When heated, the metal pack 
bobbin expands which forces the fiber to stretch and 
increase pinch loading of the fiber buffer. At the 
higher temperature, an acceleration of relaxation 
("creep") of the buffer material is experienced. 
Relaxation of the buffer material, in turn, causes 
tension in the quartz core to drop which does not, 
however, return to its prior levels when the dispenser 
assumes the original temperature. Subsequent cooling 
causes the metal bobbin to contract which further 
lowers fiber tension and introduces the threat of 
middle layers of a pack being driven into compression. It is, therefore, a desideratum to provide a 
technique of bobbin construction which will prevent or 
substantially reduce tension of the quartz core of an 
optical fiber being induced as a result of temperature-and 
humidity-induced dimensional changes in the buffer 
coating. In accordance with the practice of the present 
invention, the bobbin
