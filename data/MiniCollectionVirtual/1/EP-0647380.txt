<ABSTRACT>
Introduction of discontinuous transmission in CDMA communications techniques is achieved by using a lower spreading ratio, whereby the spread information only fills an information part of a frame in a compressed mode, leaving an idle part of the frame in which to perform other functions, such as evaluation of other frequencies and execution of seamless handover between frequencies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of Code Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) communications techniques in cellular radio telephone
communication systems, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus
for seamless handover of call links between frequencies by non-continuous
transmission in a Direct Sequence-Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA)
communication technique.CDMA or spread spectrum communications have been in existence
since the days of World War II. Early applications were predominantly
military oriented. However, today there has been an increasing interest in
using spread spectrum systems in commercial applications. Some examples
include digital cellular radio, land mobile radio, satellite systems, and indoor
and outdoor personal communication networks referred to herein collectively
as cellular systems.Currently, channel access in cellular systems is achieved using
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple
Access (TDMA) methods. In FDMA, a communication channel is a single
radio frequency band into which a signal's transmission power is
concentrated. Interference with adjacent channels is limited by the use of
band pass filters which only pass signal energy within the specified
frequency band. Thus, with each channel being assigned a different
frequency, system capacity is limited by the available frequencies as well as
by limitations imposed by channel reuse.In TDMA systems, a channel consists of a time slot in a periodic
train of time intervals over the same frequency. Each period of time slots is 
called a frame. A given signal's energy is confined to one of these time
slots. Adjacent channel interference is limited by the use of a time gate or
other synchronization element that only passes signal energy received at the
proper time. Thus, the problem of interference from different relative signal
strength levels is reduced.With FDMA or TDMA systems or hybrid FDMA/TDMA systems,
the goal is to insure that two potentially interfering signals do not occupy the
same frequency at the same time. In contrast, Code Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) allows signals to overlap in both time and frequency.
Thus, CDMA signals share the same frequency spectrum in present day
systems. In the frequency or the time domain, the multiple access signals
appear to be on top of each other.There are a number of advantages associated with CDMA
communication techniques. The capacity limits of CDMA-based cellular
systems are projected to be several times that of existing analog
