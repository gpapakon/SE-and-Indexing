<ABSTRACT>
A damping device which provides superior damping stiffness K" has linear damping characteristics as a function of amplitude and for which the temperature sensitivities of stiffnesses K*, K", K' have been minimized. The device includes a first and second fluid-filled chambers (26 and 28) which are interconnected by a passageway (43). The length and diameter of the passageway, as well as the fluid viscosity, are chosen to give the optimum damping characteristics. Further, a plurality of spring loaded pressure relief valves (82) are integrated into the assembly to allow more flow area to open when a threshold pressure is encountered, thereby reducing the internal pressures and dynamic stiffness K* at cold temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the area of fluid-and-elastomer devices.
Specifically, the invention relates to the area of fluid-and-elastomer devices
for providing damping for lead-lag motions of a helicopter rotor blade.Flexible dampers for attachment between a rotor hub assembly and
a rotor blade or cuff which exhibit a high degree of damping are desirable
for damping lead-lag motions of rotor blades on helicopters. Typically,
elastomers are used to provide this damping, such as taught in US patent
5,092,738 to Byrnes et al., US patent 4,778,343 to Hahn et al., and US patent
4,893,988 to Sato. The high degree of damping exhibited by these dampers is
typically produced by bonding the dampers in a highly-damped elastomer
such as silicone. However, these elastomeric dampers are inherently
nonlinear as a function of amplitude and can produce a loss factor of only
about 0.7. This is insufficient, under certain conditions, to control excessive
motions of the helicopter rotor blade.Additional damping can be added, over and above what is available
in an elastomeric damper, by incorporating a fluid within the damper to
provide damping at certain predetermined, or tuned, frequencies. The
commonly assigned US patent 4,811,919 to Jones
describes the addition of fluid to an elastomeric
mounting which is suitable for mounting an aircraft engine to a strut, and
also describes the means for compensating for the fluid expansion due to
temperature changes. US patent 4,236,607 to Hawles et al. describes a
vibration suppression system wherein the fluid passes through the inner
member of the mounting to provide amplified counter inertial forces.US patent 4,566,677 to Le Pierres
describes a damped fluid-and-elastomeric, lead-lag damper for
helicopter rotor blades, whereby the fluid is used to add additional damping
over and above what is available from the elastomer alone. However, this
damper is axially-acting and cannot carrying vertical loads due to flapping,
which must be accommodated in bearingless rotor systems. Furthermore, 
US patent 5,004,215 to Aubry et al. (EP-A-0 334 716)
describes another axially acting strut-type damper with linear
damping by incorporating a viscous fluid. Again, this device cannot carry
vertical loads due to flapping motions of the rotor blade, a normally
required feature of dampers which are to be used in bearingless rotor
systems.In rotor-damping systems, and in fluid devices in general, the
requirements for high damping, which necessitates the use of damped
elastomers and viscous fluids, tend
