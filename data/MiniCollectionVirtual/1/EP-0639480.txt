<ABSTRACT>
A retention clip (100 is described for securing and 
aligning an instrument module (12), such as a radio, in an 

instrument panel (80) of a vehicle. The clip (10) includes 
a base (20) and primary and secondary fingers (40,52) 

extending in cantilever fashion from the base (20) for 
retaining and releasing the module (12) from the instrument 

panel (80). The secondary fingers (52) are shorter and 
extend from the base (20) less than the primary fingers (40) 

such that the ends of the fingers will sequentially engage 
the instrument panel (80) to retain and align the module 

(12) in the instrument panel. The secondary fingers (52) 
have a removal ramp (62) engageable by a removal tool (94), 

inserted through the module (12), and a portion overlaying 
the primary fingers (40) such that when the removal tool is 

inserted, the secondary fingers (52) will retract and also 
will retract the primary fingers (40) for a slip-out fit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a retention clip for
securing an instrument module such as a radio within an
opening in an instrument panel of a vehicle as specified in the
preamble of claim 1, for example as disclosed in the document
DE-A-3811364.Many instruments on the instrument panel of a vehicle
today are designed to be installed as a module with a simple
slip-in fit wherein the module can be installed securely and
aligned properly by simply pushing it into the instrument
panel. Some type of bracket or clips will automatically
lock the particular module into place without having to
reach behind the panel to secure the module, and without
requiring any tools to install it. Many of these instrument
modules are also removable from the front, again without the
need to remove brackets or screws from behind the panel to
remove the unit from its support, by using a simple removal
tool that merely slides through some holes in the front of
the module and disengages the bracket or clip from the
instrument panel.One such design uses a pair of simple spring clips,
one each mounted on the sides of the instrument module, just
behind a front bezel of the module. An example of such a
design is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,550,944 to Simon et
al. Each clip has a pair of retention fingers with
corresponding barbs that secure and align the module in the
instrument panel. The fingers are connected to a base
portion at their rear end. The base portion fastens to the
module. The fingers either angle away from the side of the
module protruding more as they extend toward the bezel, with
the barbs on the front end of the fingers that catch on the
back side of the instrument panel; or the fingers run
parallel with the side of the module and the barbs
themselves protrude outward at the front end of the fingers
to catch on the instrument panel.Also, each of these spring clips includes a pair of
extraction ramps, each ramp connected to a corresponding
finger. The extraction ramps align with associated holes
through the front of the module bezel, which accept an 
extracting tool. A portion of the extracting tool slides up
on the ramps, which causes the ramps to pull the fingers,
and consequently the barbs, toward the side of the module,
away from the back of the instrument panel. This allows the
module to be slid out of the instrument panel.DE 3811364 discloses a spring clip for fixing
equipment such as radios in a motor vehicle. The described
clip is provided with webs 4a and 4b having fingers 6a and
6b which engage suitable
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A retention spring clip for securing an instrument module (12) in an installed
position within an opening (82) in an instrument panel (80) of a vehicle comprising:


a base (20) affixed to the instrument module (12) and a primary support member (40),
extending a first distance from the base (20), for biasing securely against the rear (86) of the

instrument panel (80) in the installed position and which allows a slip-in fit installation, and
for retaining the instrument module (12) in the installed position;

   characterised by a secondary support member (50) which allows a slip-in fit
installation, extending a second, and shorter, distance from the base including biasing for

securely positioning the tip (58) of the secondary support member (50) behind but not in contact with
the rear (86) of the instrument panel (80) and for retaining the module (12) secure in the

instrument panel (80) should the primary support member (40) not retain the module (12)
sufficiently.
A retention clip as claimed in claim 1 wherein the secondary support member
(50) comprises two support fingers (52) extending from the base (20) on either side of and

spaced from the primary support member (40).
A retention clip as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2 including a removal
ramp extending from one of the primary or the secondary support members and actuable to

release both the primary and secondary support members from the opening (82) in the
instrument panel (80) thereby allowing a slip-out fit.
A retention clip as claimed in claim 3 wherein the removal range (62) extends
from each of the secondary support fingers (52).
A retention clip as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in which the
base (20), primary support member (40) and secondary support member (50) are integrally

formed. 
A retention clip as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims wherein the primary support member (40) and

the secondary support member (50) are biased under a prestress
when in the installed position.
A combination of an instrument module with a pair
of retention clips as claimed in any one of the preceding

claims.
