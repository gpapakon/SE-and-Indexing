<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the design of a plastic clip (1) for holding together sheet-like objects. In order to be able to insert objects into the clip easily by hand along as long a pinch line as possible and so that they are held with as great a force as possible, the invention calls for the two halves (2, 3) of the clip to be hinged to each other by two hinge points (8), disposed a certain distance apart from each other and both parallel to the pinch line (6), each hinge point being surrounded by a U-shaped spring (7) whose arms (9) are braced against the grips (4, 5) of the two halves (2, 3) of the clip.
