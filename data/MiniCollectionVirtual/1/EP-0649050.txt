<ABSTRACT>
A package (10) enclosing a stack of rolls (1) 
includes a carrying means (12), a first tray-like 

member (40) mounted on the carrying means (12) and a 
roll support member (14) for receiving and supporting 

the rolls (1) in a vertical stack. A moisture and 
light impervious member (16) is wrapped around the 

vertical stack with the top most roll (3) in the stack 

at least partially abutting the first closed end of the 
package (10). Means for opening and closing the first 

and second closed end portions are provided. In the 
preferred embodiment, overlapping flap portions (82,84) 

are formed and then sealed together via tape 30. A 
second tray-like member (42) is mounted onto the first 

closed end of the package (10) and the unitized package 
is wrapped with at least one strap (44) to secure the 

package (10) to the carrying means (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to packages for rolls 
of web. More particularly, the invention concerns 
packages for storing and shipping rolls of 
photosensitive web, such as photographic paper. Presently bulk rolls of web, such as 
photographic paper, are generally individually wrapped 
and placed in light tight bags or pouches. As depicted 
in Figure 1, typically rolls 1 of photographic paper 
are grouped together and then packaged. More 
particularly, the rolls 1 of photographic paper are 
placed in a corrugated tray 5 that is adhesively 
attached to a shipping pallet (not shown). The group 
of rolls 1 are then stretch wrapped (not illustrated). 
Finally, a two piece corrugated wrap 6 is used to 
enclose the stretch wrapped affair to reinforce the 
rolls 1 of photographic paper as well as to unitize the 
package. A corrugated top tray 7 is then placed over 
the completed wrap and the entire unitized package is 
enclosed in a second stretched wrap (not shown). A shortcoming of existing packaging formats 
for bulk photographic web is that its construction 
involves excessive wrapping materials. For instance, 
the double stretch wrapped layers of existing packaging 
exasperates the problem of adding material to the waste 
disposal stream. Moreover, another problem with 
existing packaging for bulk rolls of photographic web 
is that the packaging arrangement contains less 
material per pallet than does the package of the 
invention. This shortcoming requires the customer, for 
example the photofinisher, to make more frequent paper 
supply changes. Thus, process and equipment uptime are 
adversely affected. Moreover, existing packages are  
 
provided largely with non-recyclable materials 
surrounding the individual rolls of paper. 
Furthermore, it is important to photofinishing 
operations that the rolls of photosensitive paper 
enclosed in the package have cores that are compatible 
with the photographic paper dispenser, such as the one 
described in U.S. Application Serial No. 952,897, filed 
November 20, 1992, and based on priority French 
application No. 9000007375, filed June 8, 1990, which 
provides an external source of photographic paper to 
photoprinting equipment. One attempt to address one or more of the 
above problems is disclosed in US-A-5,163,556 by Akao 
and others. Akao teaches a package assembly of roll-form 
photographic paper comprising a roll support 
member fixed to a pallet and a plastic pouch enclosing 
the stack and sealed at top end and tied around the 
perimeter of the package at the
