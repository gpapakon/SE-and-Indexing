<ABSTRACT>
Device for adjusting movable parts on vehicles, in particular windows, lifting roofs or the like, with a telescopic hoist (15), which has at least three threaded parts (16, 17, 18) which can be screwed one into the other in the manner of a telescope and of which at least two (16, 17) carry guide pieces (31, 33), which engage in respective threads (32, 34) of another threaded part, the telescopic hoist being secured on the driving side against axial displacement and being rotatable manually or using a motor, and being secured on the output side against rotation and being coupled to the movable vehicle part (11). The thread pitch of all of the threads (32, 34) of the telescopic hoist (15), which threads cooperate with a guide piece (31, 33), is designed non-uniformly in such a manner over at least part of its extent that the force/path characteristic curve (45, 46) of the telescopic hoist (15) is matched to the force/path variation which occurs when the movable vehicle part (11) is being adjusted.
