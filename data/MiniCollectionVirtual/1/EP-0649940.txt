<ABSTRACT>
Waste paper pulp stock containing undefibered waste paper 
is supplied to a cylindrical screen plate (18,19) within 

an outer casing (2) thereby separating it into accept 
stock, which passes through the screen plate (18,19) and 

is then discharged through one or more accept stock 
outlets (4,5), and reject, which does not pass through 

the screen plate (18,19). The reject is then passed 
through a defibering gap defined between a defibering 

stator (23) and a rotating defibering rotor (24) whereby 
at least some of the undefibered waste paper is 

defibered. At least some of the reject is diluted with 
dilution water and the diluted reject is then 

recirculated to the screen plate (18,19) or alternatively 
it is supplied to a further screen plate (20) and 

dilution water is also passed to the screen plate 
(18,19). The reject from the second screening process is 

then discharged, at least in part, through a reject 
outlet (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for separating contaminants from waste paper
pulp stock and defibering undefibered waste paper for use
by industries which use waste paper pulp as stock, such
as the paper pulp and fiberboard industries. More
specifically, the invention relates to apparatus for
screening waste paper pulp stock of the type comprising
a cylindrical casing having a stock inlet at one end, a
reject outlet at the other end and one or more accept
stock outlets between its ends, a cylindrical screen
plate concentrically arranged within the casing and
spaced from its peripheral wall, an annular defibering
stator concentrically arranged adjacent the end of the
screen plate closest to the reject outlet, a rotor
arranged within the casing for rotation about its axis
within the screen plate, the casing defining an inlet
chamber, which communicates with the stock inlet and with
the space inside the screen plate, an accept stock
chamber between the screen plate and the wall of the
casing, which communicates with the accept stock
outlet(s), and a reject chamber, which communicates with
the reject outlet, the rotor carrying scraper blades
opposed to the screen plate to prevent clogging thereof
and a defibering rotor opposed to the defibering stator
and defining therewith a defibering gap which
communicates with the reject chamber and with the space
within the screen plate and means for supplying dilution
water to the space downstream of the defibering gap.Screening apparatus is generally composed of coarse and
fine screening stages. In the coarse screening stage, relatively large
contaminants are removed, using a screen plate with holes
usable for relatively high consistency (2 to 4%) stock
slurry, that is to say stock slurry containing 2 to 4% by
weight solid material, in order to reduce the quantity of
contaminants which is transferred to the fine screening
stage.In the fine screening stage, fine contaminants not
removable by the above-mentioned hole screen plate are
removed, using a screen plate with slots suitable for
relatively low consistency (0.5 to 2%) stock slurry so as
to facilitate the passage of the stock through the
screen.In general, the screening efficiency or removal ratio of
contaminants by a screen is closely related to the reject
ratio. An increase or decrease of reject ratio lead to
an enhancement or reduction of the contaminant removal
ratio, respectively. Attempts to reduce the reject ratio
in an ordinary screen will tend to cause plugging or
clogging of
