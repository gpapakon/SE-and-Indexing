<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the field of trigger 
dispensers, also known as trigger sprayers. The invention 
is particularly directed to a trigger sprayer having 
structure for foaming a dispensed liquid where the structure 
is adapted for adjustments to vary the foam pattern 
of the dispensed liquid to obtain an optimum foam pattern 
for any particular liquid, and to the incorporation of a 
device integral with the sprayer nozzle housing for sealing 
the opening of a foam dispensing passage of the 
foamer trigger sprayer. There are numerous patents that have issued on 
trigger dispensers of the general type to which this 
invention relates. The patents discussed below exemplify 
such trigger dispensers. Generally, a trigger dispenser 
of the type involved here is a relatively low-cost pump 
device which is held in the hand and which has a trigger 
operable by squeezing or pulling the fingers of the hand 
to pump liquid from a container and through a nozzle at 
the front of the dispenser.  Such trigger dispensers may have a variety of features 
that have become common and well-known in the industry. 
For example, the dispenser may be a dedicated 
sprayer that produces a defined spray pattern for the 
liquid as it is dispensed from the nozzle. It is also 
known to provide adjustable spray patterns such that with 
a single dispenser the user may select any one of several 
stream patterns from a stream to a fine mist. Some known 
trigger dispensers also include a way to seal the dispenser 
to prevent liquid from leaking from the nozzle orifice 
during shipment or non-use. A variety of sealing 
arrangements are known as will be more fully explained. It is also well-known to provide trigger dispensers 
with a means to produce foaming of the liquid as it 
is dispensed from the nozzle orifice. Such trigger dispensers 
are generally referred to in the industry as 
"foamers". Typically, the foam is produced by providing 
a structure forward of the nozzle orifice upon which the 
liquid from the orifice impinges to produce turbulence, 
and thus foaming of the liquid and/or the added structure 
has openings for admitting air for entrapment by the 
liquid to cause the foaming. Various types of foamers 
are known as will be more fully described below. A common 
attribute of foamers is that the foam pattern they 
dispense is not adjustable because the structure forward 
of the nozzle that produces the foaming of the liquid is 
constructed in a fixed position from the nozzle. This is 
not a problem in use of known
