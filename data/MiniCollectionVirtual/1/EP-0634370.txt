<ABSTRACT>
Process for the treatment of an aqueous effluent including a stage of biological denitrification consisting in placing the said effluent in contact with a heterotrophic bacterial flora in nonaerated medium so as to permit the reduction of at least a part of the nitrates present in this effluent to gaseous nitrogen, characterised in that it consists in placing the said nitrate-laden effluent in contact with sludge originating from the purification station, during the denitrification stage, so that the specific ratio of the weight content of suspended matter in the said sludge to the weight content of nitrates in the said effluent is at least 10.
