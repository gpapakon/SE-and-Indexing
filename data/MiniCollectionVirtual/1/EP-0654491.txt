<ABSTRACT>
A reduced glass transition temperature 
copolyester-carbonate which displays non-Newtonian 

melt behavior was synthesized by using bisphenol-A, 
a dicarboxylic acid and a trisphenol. The branched 

copolymer was obtained by interfacial phosgenation. 
One of the compositions described displays a Tg of 

about 127°C and twice the melt flow index of a 
branched polycarbonate of corresponding molecular 

weight or intrinsic viscosity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to thermoplastic resin
compositions and more particularly relates to
improved, blow-moldable copolyester-carbonate
resins and articles molded therefrom.Aromatic copolyester-carbonate resins are a
well known class of synthetic polymeric resins,
generally prepared by the reaction of a polyhydric
phenol with a carbonate precursor in the presence
of an ester precursor; see for example U.S. Patent
3,169,121. Although such resins have been found to
be thermoplastically moldable under a broad range
of molding conditions, only select copolyester-carbonate
resin compositions are useful for blow-molding.
This is due to the unique requirements of
a thermoplastic resin for blow-molding operations;
see for example the requirements for the branched
copolyester-carbonate resins described in U.S.
Patents 4,286,083 and 4,621,132. The branched
copolyester-carbonate resins differ from most
thermoplastic polymers used for molding in their
melt rheology behavior. Most thermoplastic
polymers exhibit non-Newtonian flow characteristics
over essentially all melt processing conditions.
However, in contrast to most thermoplastic
polymers, certain branched copolyester-carbonates
prepared from dihydric phenols exhibit Newtonian
flow at normal processing temperatures and shear
rates below 300 reciprocal seconds. Newtonian flow is defined as the type of flow
occurring in a liquid system where the rate of shear
is directly proportional to the shearing force.Two other characteristics of molten
thermoplastic polymers are considered to be
significant for molding operations: melt elasticity
and melt strength. Melt elasticity is the recovery
of the elastic energy stored within the melt from
distortion or orientation of the molecules by
shearing stresses. Melt strength may be simply
described as the tenacity of a molten strand and
indicates the ability of the melt to support a
stress. Both of these characteristics are important
in extrusion blow molding, particularly in
fabrication by extrusion blow molding of relatively
large articles. Non-Newtonian flow characteristics
tend to impart melt elasticity and melt strength to
polymers thus allowing their use in blow molding
fabrication.In the conventional blow-molding operation, a
tube of the heat-softened copolyester-carbonate
resin may be extruded vertically into a mold. The
extrudate is then pressed unto the mold surfaces
with a pressurized gas flow (usually air or inert
gas), shaping the heat-softened resin. As mentioned
above, the successful molding of a given
thermopl
