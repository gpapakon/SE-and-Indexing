<DESCRIPTION>
 Cloning of the zymocin gene and use of zymocin in beveragesTechnical fieldThe present invention discloses a method for preserving beverages comprising the use of a killer toxin. Specifically an effective amount of a zymocin is used. The zymocin is particularly used in carbonated drinks. The invention also discloses the cloning of the Williopsis rakii DNA and the DNA sequence encoding zymocin. This makes possible overexpression and large scale production of zymocin.Background of the inventionSpoilage of food by yeasts is a well known problem in food industry. In some products yeasts are the main source of spoilage. Fruits belong to the natural habitat of yeasts. Therefore, it is not surprising that fruit derived products and fruit containing products are susceptible to contamination" by yeasts. Examples are fruit pulp, fruit juice, fruit containing softdrinks and carbonated beverages, which sometimes contain high percentages of fruit juice. Spoilage of those products is even a major problem in industry. Softdrinks and carbonated beverages are to be considered as a very selective environment for the growth of yeasts. This environment has peculiar physical characteristics specifically low pH, low oxygen concentration and high sugar concentration. Furthermore storage is at low temperature. Yeasts have the ability to ferment the sugars introduced as such or those introduced with the fruits. Out- growth of yeasts is responsible for off-flavours, there is loss of texture quality and gas is produced. The production of gas can cause swelling or even blowing up of the container. In the case of carbonated beverages bottled in glass this phenomenon has caused severe injuries. Sellar. 

P. . and P.B. Johnston (BMJ (1991) 303 : 176-177)) describe how the seriousness of ocular injuries caused by exploding bottles has been underestimated. T. illhoft (New Scientist (1986) 21 Aug., 28-30) also reports the popping bottle problem. The problem is due to carbon dioxide and although not specifically reported it is known that this gas is also produced by yeasts.Yeast genera most frequently isolated from fruit and fruit products are Saccharomvces. Kluweromvces. Zygosaccharo vces. Debarvomvces, Hansenula, Candida. Pichia and Torulopsis. The yeasts are introduced into the products with the ingredients such as the fruits. The yeasts also may grow on the surfaces of the production equipment.In spite of good hygienic production methods and the use of preservatives like sorbate and benzoate spoilage of fruit products is still very
