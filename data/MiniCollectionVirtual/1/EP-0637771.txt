<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display apparatus, and more particularly, to a
liquid crystal display apparatus having a wide viewing
angle.As the screen size and capacity of the
liquid crystal display apparatuses increases, vigorous
efforts have been made to increase the use of liquid
crystal display apparatuses, which utilize the electro-optic
characteristics of a liquid crystal, in wider
applications in the field of office automation equipment.
Liquid crystal display apparatuses currently in
common use are classified by their respective operation
modes. Generally, there are two types; twisted
nematic (TN) type wherein liquid crystal molecules
interposed between two glass substrates show an orientation
twisted 90°, and super twisted nematic (STN)
type wherein the liquid crystal molecules show orientations
twisted 180° to 270°. The TN type is used mainly
in active matrix liquid crystal display apparatuses,
and the STN type is used in simple matrix type liquid
crystal display apparatuses. These apparatuses will be
described below with reference to the accompanying
drawings.In the case of the TN type used in active
matrix type liquid crystal display apparatuses or in
liquid crystal display apparatuses of small sizes, the
liquid crystal molecules in the interface with the 
glass substrate are uniformly oriented in the same
direction at a pre-tilt angle to the glass substrate,
with the orientation being twisted 90° between the
upper and lower glass substrates. The 90° twist in the
orientation is obtained, in general, by rubbing rayon
fabric or the like against an alignment film comprising
a thin polyimide film formed on the glass substrate in
one direction, and arranging the upper and lower substrates
such that the directions on the two substrates
are at right angles to each other.When a voltage is applied to a TN type liquid
crystal display apparatus as shown in Figure 1, the
liquid crystal molecules 101 in the state of orientation
twisted 90° begin to respond. As the voltage
increases beyond the threshold voltage, the state of
twisted orientation decays and replaced by splay orientation,
so that the major axes of the liquid crystal
molecules 101 are caused to erect out of the plane of
the glass substrates 102 and 103. When the liquid
crystal molecules 101 are observed in a direction of
angle from the normal line (Z axis) of the substrate
while changing the azimuth , the major axes of the
liquid crystal molecules 101 are not uniform in the
direction of azimuth angle. As a result,
