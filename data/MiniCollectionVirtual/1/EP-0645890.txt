The invention relates to semiconductor integrated circuits,
and more particularly to an improvement in semiconductor
BiCMOS logic circuits.From US 5 107 141 and from EP-A-0 099 100 BiCMOS logic
circuits are known. The problem of the known circuits is the
capacitance of the pull-down bipolar transistor so that the
rise and fall time is high and high speed performance is low.Semiconductor integrated circuits including BiCMOS logic gate
circuits have been known and BiCMOS circuits may be useful in
the form of various logic circuits such as an invertor
circuit. One of conventional logic circuits including BiCMOS
circuits will be described with reference to FIG. 1. The
conventional BiCMOS logic circuit forms an invertor circuit
that has an input terminal 1 and an output terminal 2 and is
biased between a high voltage line 3 for supplying a high
voltage VCC and a ground line 4 for supplying a ground voltage
GND. The invertor circuit including the BiCMOS transistor
comprises first and second npn bipolar transistors 17 and 18
and first and second base driving 
circuits 23 and 24. The first base driving circuit 23 is
electrically connected to the input terminal 1 and a base of the
first bipolar transistor 17. The second base driving circuit 23
is electrically connected to the input terminal 1 and a base of
the second bipolar transistor 18. The first and second base
driving circuits 23 and 24 are connected to each other between
the high voltage line 3 and the ground line 4 in which the first
base driving circuit 23 is connected to the high voltage line 3
and the ground line 4, while the second base driving circuit 24
is connected through the first base driving circuit 23 to the
high voltage line 3 and connected to the ground line 4. The
first base driving circuit 23 comprises complementary MOS
transistor circuits including a first p-channel MOS transistor
19 and an n-channel MOS transistor 20. The first p-channel MOS
transistor 19 has a gate electrode electrically connected to the
input terminal 1, a source electrically connected to the high
voltage line 3 and a drain electrically connected to the base of
the first bipolar transistor 17. The second n-channel MOS
transistor 20 has a gate electrode electrically connected to the
input terminal 1, a source electrically connected to the ground
line 4 and a drain electrically connected to the base of the
first bipolar transistor 17 or connected to the drain of the p-channel
MOS transistor 19. By contrast, the second base driving
circuit 24 comprises a third n-channel
