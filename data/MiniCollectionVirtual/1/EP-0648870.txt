<ABSTRACT>
A cottony polytetrafluoroethylene material is obtained by breaking a 
monoaxially stretched polytetrafluoroethylene molding by a mechanical force. 

This material contains 5-150 mm long fibers having branches and crimps and a cross section with an 
indefinite shape. It can be interlaced so well that it can readily provide nonwoven fabric.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fibers excellent in
intermingling property, cotton-like materials containing
those fibers and a process for preparation thereof.In recent years, non-woven fabrics comprising
synthetic fibers, by making the best use of
characteristics of those fibers, are extending their
applications into various fields, such as clothing
materials, medical materials, engineering and building
materials, and materials for industrial use.Among them, non-woven fabrics containing PTFE
fibers are excellent in heat resistance, chemical
resistance and abrasion resistance, and are expected to be
further developed as highly functional non-woven fabrics.Cotton-like PTFE materials being made into the
non-woven fabrics are gathered PTFE fibers, and so far
have been made in such manners as mentioned below:
(1) A process for producing filaments and then
cutting to a desired length.
The process for producing PTFE filaments is
roughly classified into the following two processes.
(1a) An emulsion spinning method disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 2,772,444. This method comprises
extrusion spinning of a viscose binder, and the like
containing PTFE particles, and then sintering to obtain
the filaments having a circular section. Major problems
of that method are such that a binder remains as a
carbonaceous residual after sintering, the obtained PTFE
filaments are colored in a dark brown, and that even if
the carbonaceous residual is oxidized to be discolored, an 
original purity cannot be maintained.(1b) A method disclosed in JP-B-22915/1961 or
JP-B-8769/1973. This method comprises stretching of
fibers obtained by slitting a PTFE film to a desired
width. A problem of this method is that the smaller the
slit width is, the more easily the fibers are broken at
the time of stretching.Both PTFE fibers obtained by the methods (la) and
(1b) have a low friction coefficient and a high specific
gravity inherant to the PTFE, and therefore are not
intermingled sufficiently with each other even if having
been crimped.
(JP-B-22621/1975)(2) A process for preparing PTFE fibrous powder
in the form of a pulp and making a sheet-like material
therefrom by paper making process (U.S. Patent No.
3,003,912 and JP-B-15906/1969).The method of the above-mentioned U.S. patent is
to cut PTFE rod obtained by a paste extrusion, to a short
length and to apply a shearing force to obtain fibrous
PTFE powder.JP-B-15906/1969 discloses a method for making
fibers by applying a shearing force to the PTFE powder.Any
