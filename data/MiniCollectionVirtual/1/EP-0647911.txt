<ABSTRACT>
In order to perform tire design and development highly 
efficiently and provide a tire at low cost, a tire basic 

model for representing a tire cross-sectional shape 
including an internal structure and being divided into a 

plurality of elements, an objective function for 
representing a physical quantity for evaluation of tire 

performance, design variables for determining a physical 
property of rubber members, and a constraint condition for 

constraining the physical property of the rubber members are 
determined (100, 102). A value of the objective function 

and a value of the constraint condition are calculated in 
accordance with Young's moduli of the rubber members when 

the design variable is altered by a unit quantity Î”r
i
, and a 
sensitivity is calculated for each of the design variables 

(106-112). Predicted values of variation quantities of the 
design variables for maximizing the value of the objective 

function while satisfying the constraint condition are 
calculated by using the sensitivity (114). The steps 

described above are repeated until the value of the 
objective function converges (118). Young's moduli of the 

rubber members are determined on the basis of design 
variables when the value of the objective function converges 

to a predicted value (120).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for designing
pneumatic tires, and in particular relates to a method for
designing pneumatic tires which provides efficient and easy
design and development of the structure, shape and the like
of tires for achieving single objective performance of
tires, antinomic performance and the like, and is capable of
determining the best structure and shape of tires and
designing tires with high cost performance.Generally, as for a method for designing tires taking
physical properties into consideration, design and
development have been made in a conventional ordinary method
such that a plurality of rubber members with known physical
properties are set beforehand, the physical property is
altered for each of the rubber members, a tire with an
altered physical property is manufactured in trial and
tested, and trials and tests are repeated until target
performance is obtained for rolling resistance, spring
constant and the like.However, in the design and development of tires using
the conventional design method, a target value was
determined for certain performance, and achievement of this
target value was once regarded as completion. There has
been no concept that the best performance, that is most
excellent in other words, is obtained by using given
resources. Further, neither antinomic performance was
designed, nor the best shape and structure were determined.
Besides, any design method has had problems of extreme
inefficiency and high cost because development is performed
by repeating trial and error in the trial production and
tests.Attention is also drawn to the disclosures of EP-A-0 642 916 which has to be considered as prior art pursuant to Article 54(3) and (4) EPC, and "Tire Science and Technology", vol. 14, No. 2, April 1986, pages 116-124, Rothert et al. Thus an object of the present invention is to provide a
method for designing pneumatic tires in which the best mode
of a tire can be designed under given conditions, design and
development of tires are made highly efficient, and tires
can be provided at low cost, when it is intended to obtain a
certain single performance or a plurality of antinomic
performances.In order to achieve the object described above, as a
result of various investigations, the present inventor has
noticed application of the "optimization design technique"
utilized in a different field to the special field of
tires made investigations, and established a method for
designing tires specifically considering physical properties.
