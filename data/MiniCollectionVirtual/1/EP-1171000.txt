<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel protective cultures, containing lactic acid-producing bacteria for preserving foodstuffs or animal feed which can only be conserved for a limited period of time, even under refrigeration. The protective cultures can inhibit the growth of bacteria which are dangerous to the consumer, if the cold chain is interrupted, or if the prescribed cooling temperature is exceeded. The invention further relates to foodstuffs or animal feed which contain the inventive protective cultures.

<CLAIMS>
Protective cultures for preserving food- or feedstuff that can be maintained stable
under cooling for a restricted period of time, comprising non-pathogenic lactic acid

bacteria having the following characteristics,

a) the lactic acid bacteria exhibit no perceptible metabolic activity, no souring and
growth activity, below 7°C;
b) the number of said potentially metabolically active lactic acid bacteria decreases
by less than two decimal powers at temperatures below 7°C over a period of one

to two weeks; and
c) said lactic acid bacteria inhibit the growth of toxinogenic and/or taxi-infectious
bacteria at temperatures of at least 7°C,

wherein said lactic acid bacteria are from the strain 
Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis

1526 (DSM 12415).
Lactic acid bacteria, wherein said lactic acid bacteria are of the strain 
Lactococcus
lactis subsp. Lactis 1526
 (DSM 12415).
The use of protective cultures comprising non-pathogenic lactic acid bacteria having
the following characteristics,


a) the lactic acid bacteria exhibit no perceptible metabolical activity, no souring
and growth activity, below 7°C;
b) the number of said potential metabolically active lactic acid bacteria,
decreases by less than two decimal powers at temperatures below 7°C over 

a period of one to two weeks; and
c) said lactic acid bacteria inhibit the growth of toxinogenic and/or texi-infectious
bacteria at temperatures of at least 7°C, wherein the toxinogenic and/or toxi-infectious

bacteria are 
Staphylococcus aureus,
 Salmonella, human-pathogenic
strains of 
E
.
coli
 (EIEC, ETEC, EPEC, EHEC), 
Shigella
,

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio parahemolyticus
, 
Aeromonas hydrophila
,

Camphylobacter jejuni, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens
 and

Clostridium botulinum,

for the preservation of food- or feedstuff that can be maintained stable under cooling
for a restricted period of time, during storage at temperatures below 7°C.
The food- or feedstuff obtainable by the use of claim 3.
The foodstuff according to claim 4, wherein the foodstuff is selected from the group
consisting of meat or meat product, fish or fish product, delicatessen salad and precooked

ready meals.
