<ABSTRACT>
An assembly (5) for restraining the upper limbs of an occupant of a seat, particularly an aircraft ejector seat (1), includes a storage unit (65) which is adapted to be fixedly secured to an upper back portion (16) of the seat (1). The storage unit (65) houses a pair of movable cover members (69, 70) and first and second bladder units (75, 76). The cover members (69, 70) and bladder units (75, 76) are connected by means of straps (90, 91) to quick release fittings (94, 95) which mate with corresponding connecting members (111, 112) carried by the occupant and then to a fixed structure adjacent the seat (1). When it is desired to deploy the restraint assembly (5), a tension is applied to the straps (90, 91) which causes the cover members (69, 70) to extend around opposite sides and laterally inward of the occupant's body, about respective arms of the occupant, and the bladder units (75, 76) to extend about the occupant's neck. The bladder units (75, 76) are then inflated so as to permit undesirable movement of the occupant's head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a restraint assembly and, more particularly,
to a restraint assembly adapted for use in combination with an aircraft ejector seat so
as to restrain the movement of an occupant's arms and head during an ejection
sequence.Ejection seats for use in aircrafts are widely known in the art. A problem has
been encountered in the prior art wherein if the occupants's limbs are spread away
from the occupant's body during an ejection sequence, serious injuries, including loss
of the limbs, can occur as the seat is propelled out of the aircraft. This problem has been recognized in the prior art and attempts have been made
to solve the problem by incorporating a restraint assembly having straps secured to
each of the occupant's arms and legs which are tightened during an ejection sequence
so that the occupant's limbs are drawn close to the body of the occupant. An example
of such a prior art device is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,202,384.Such a prior art arrangement has various undesirable characteristics. For
instance, it can be difficult to secure the straps to each of the occupant's arms without
assistance. In addition, the straps must accommodate, without hindering, all
necessary movements of the occupant's limbs. Finally, in practice, it has been found
that such systems are cumbersome.It has also been proposed in the prior art to incorporate arm restraining net
systems on ejector seats as exemplified by U.S. Patent Nos. 4,081,156, 4,215,835 and
4,592,523. Unfortunately, these known systems fail to solve the problem associated
with the prior art in a completely effective and cost-efficient manner. For instance,
the arm restraining net systems in '156 and '835 patents not only require additional
structural changes to the ejector seat itself in order to shift the arm restraining systems
between stored and deployed positions, but the restraining nets only prevent the
occupant's arms from movement laterally outwardly due to the limited travel of the
netting about the occupant's body.The restraining net system disclosed in the '523 patent, in addition to requiring
substantial changes to the ejector seat, must be designed to the general size of the 
occupant in order to be effective, especially with
regards to restraining the movement of the occupant's
head and is considered to be unreliable due to the
manner of deployment and complex construction.US 4,359,200 (Brevard et al.) discloses an occupant

<CLAIMS>
An occupant restraint assembly (5) adapted for
attachment to a seat (1) that carries a storage unit

(15) at an upper back support portion (16) thereof for
restraining movement of the upper limbs of an occupant

thereof upon occurrence of a prerequisite condition,
comprising


a shroud movable between a stowed position wherein
said shroud is housed within the storage unit and a

deployed position wherein first and second cover members
(69,70) of said shroud extend out of the storage unit

(65), around opposite sides and laterally inward of an
upper body portion of the occupant to retain an

occupant's arms against the occupant's upper body; and
a bladder assembly (75,76) movable between a
deflated, stowed position within said storage unit and

an inflated, deployed position;

   characterised in that in said inflated, deployed
position said bladder assembly extends about the

occupant's neck.
The occupant restraint assembly (5) according to
claim 1, characterized in that said bladder assembly

(75,76) is attached to said shroud.
The occupant restraint assembly (5) according to
either of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that said

shroud has attached thereto at least one strap (90,91),
said at least one strap (90,91) having tension applied

thereto upon occurrence of the prerequisite condition. 
The occupant restraint assembly (5) according to any one of claims 1-3,
characterized in that said first and second cover members (69, 70) comprise netting.
The occupant restraint assembly (5) according to claim 3 in combination with
an aircraft ejector seat assembly that is removably attached within a cockpit and

includes a parachute (24) attached to the seat (1), along with an ejection control
member (52) for activating an ejecting mechanism (55), characterized in that the

prerequisite condition constitutes operation of said ejection control member (52).
The combination according to claim 5, characterized in that said ejector seat
assembly includes at least one riser strap (26, 27) connected to the parachute (24),

said at least one strap (90, 91) being secured to said at least one riser strap (26, 27).
The combination according to claim 6, characterized in that said at least one
strap (90, 91) is releasably interconnected to the cockpit.
The combination according to any one of claims 5, 6 or 7, characterized in
that said ejector seat assembly further includes a lap belt unit (35) adapted to extend

across a lap area of said seat (1), said restraint assembly (5) being attached to said lap
belt unit (35).
