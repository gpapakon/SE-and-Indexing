<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a thermionic cathode structure comprises the steps of:-(1) 
forming a mixture of (a) tungsten powder, (b) at least one of the group 

comprising alumina or zirconia or yttrium oxide powder, (c) alkaline earth metal 
carbonate powder, and (d) a binder, (2) pressing the mixture isostatically causing 

the mixture to adhere to form an electrically insulating body, (3) sintering the body 
in a dry hydrogen ambient thereby reducing the carbonate, and (4) coating the 

surface of the body or a portion of the surface with a poly-crystalline metal layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a thermionic cathode 
structure comprising the steps of (a) forming a mixture comprising (i) tungsten 
powder, (ii) at least one of alumina or zirconia or yttrium oxide 
powder, (iii) alkaline earth metal carbonate powder, and (iv) a binder, (b) pressing the 
mixture thereby causing the mixture to adhere to form a body, and (c) sintering the 
body in a reducing ambient thereby decomposing the said carbonate. In a known such method used to manufacture discharge lamp electrodes and 
disclosed in US 4,303,848, the sintered body is electrically conductive. Such 
electrodes are not suitable for use as replacements for dispenser cathodes, and require 
additional electrically insulating layers if heating elements are to be attached, thus 
making assembly expensive. It is an object of the present invention to enable these disadvantages to be 
mitigated. According to the invention a method of manufacturing a thermionic cathode 
structure as defined in the first paragraph above is characterized in that the sintered body is an electrical 
insulator, and the method further comprises the step of (d) providing a poly-crystalline 
metal layer on a surface of the body. The mixture may be deposited onto a substrate prior to pressing thereby 
causing the mixture to adhere to the substrate to form a single body. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, 
with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:- 
Figure 1 shows a thermionic cathode structure made using a method of manufacture 
according to the present invention, and Figure 2 is a flow diagram of the method used to make the structure of Figure 1. In Figure 1 a thermionic cathode structure comprises a body 6 having a poly-crystalline 
tungsten/osmium layer 7 deposited on its upper surface by sputtering, the 
body being held at one end of a cylindrical metal heat choke 8 by means of a 
platinum foil collar 9 spot welded to the heat choke. A heating element 10 is present  
 
adjacent the body 6. The body 6 is manufactured by a method comprising the sequence of steps 
shown in the flow diagram of figure 2. In this diagram block 1 denotes the step of 
forming a mixture comprising (i) tungsten powder, (ii) at least one of the group 
comprising alumina or zirconia or yttrium oxide powder, (iii) alkaline earth metal 
carbonate powder, and (iv) a binder, block 2 denotes pressing the mixture thereby 
causing the mixture to adhere to form a body, block 3 denotes sintering
