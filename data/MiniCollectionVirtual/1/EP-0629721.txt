<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to non-tacky, highly elastic polyester-polyurethane elastomer monofilaments and multifilaments produced by melt spinning from a partially crosslinked thermoplastic polyurethane which in turn is obtainable by reacting     a) at least one organic diisocyanate with b) at least one polyester diol having a molecular weight of 500 to 5000, c) at least one difunctional hydroxyl-containing chain extender having a molecular weight of 62 to 380, and d) at least one at least trifunctional hydroxyl-containing crosslinking agent, to a process for their production by melt spinning and to their use for producing fibres and textile fabrics.
