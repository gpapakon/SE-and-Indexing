<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a vacuum insulation panel is provided which 
includes the steps of: drying a quantity of microporous powder; evacuating the 

powder of gases; evacuating a gas impermeable bag of gases; loading the powder 
into the gas impermeable bag while the bag and powder remain in an evacuated 

condition; and sealing the gas evacuated bag with the gas evacuated powder therein 
to form a vacuum insulation panel. The powder in the bag should be compacted 

before the bag is sealed and also a trace amount of helium may be injected into the 
bag prior to sealing to assist in leak detection of the sealed panel. The panel with 

injected helium has an internal pressure not exceeding 1mm Hg.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum panel manufacturing process, and in 
particular a process utilizing a powdered insulation material which is first evacuated of 
gases and subsequentially loaded and hermetically sealed into an impermeable barrier 
bag. Vacuum insulation panels are useful in a variety of environments, and in 
particular in conjunction with refrigeration apparatus in which they are utilized as 
insulating panels in the walls of refrigerators and freezers. Typically a vacuum insulation panel has some type of insulating material, 
generally microporous powders or microporous sheets of insulating material which are 
placed into a non-porous bag and, after evacuation of all gases, the bag is sealed. 
Such panels and a method for fabricating them are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
5,018,328, assigned to Whirlpool Corporation, the assignee of the present application, 
the disclosure of said patent being incorporated herein by reference, as well as in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 5,076,984 and 4,683,702. US 5,076,984 discloses a method 
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. U.S. Patent No. 4,554,041 discloses a vacuum insulated pipe in 
which the evacuated insulating space is filled with powder from an evacuated 
hopper. German Patent 40 40 144 discloses a method for filling a bag with 
dust-like material wherein the bag and the dust-like material are vacuum 
evacuated prior to and during filling of the bag.  
 The present invention provides a method for manufacturing vacuum panels in a 
significantly improved process over other presently known processes. In an embodiment of the invention, the microporous powder is initially heated 
and dried and transferred, under. a dry nitrogen or dry air blanket, to a hopper. In the 
hopper, the powder is evacuated of gases (preferably while the powder is hot) and 
then transferred to a metering hopper. Separately, the barrier bags are moved into an air lock chamber where gases 
are evacuated and, subsequent to the evacuation, the bags are moved into a filling 
chamber. In the filling chamber the metering hoppers are actuated to cause the 
evacuated powder to be dispensed into the bags to fill the bags. Once the bags have 
been filled they are heat sealed closed. As an option, after the bags have been filled 
with the evacuated powder, and just prior to sealing of the bags, a small and specific 
amount of helium (preferably at a pressure of less than 1mm Hg) can be injected into 
the bag which is then immediately sealed in order to allow for helium leak

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing a vacuum insulation panel using a 
gas impervious barrier bag comprising the steps of: 


loading (22) a quantity of microporous powder into a storage 
hopper; 
removing (24) moisture from said powder; 
subsequently filling (30) said barrier bag with said powder; 
subsequently sealing (30) said barrier bag with said powder 
therein to form a vacuum insulation panel; characterised in that said powder 

and said barrier bag are separately evacuated (24,28) prior to insertion of said 
powder in said bag. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said removal (24) of 
moisture from said powder occurs by heating said powder to a temperature 

elevated above standard room temperature in a vacuum environment. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein said powder is elevated 
to a temperature of at least 200Â°C. 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said powder is 
compacted in said bag prior to sealing (30) of said bag.  

 
A method according to claim 4, wherein said compaction is 
achieved by vibration of said bag. 
A method according to claim 4, wherein said compaction is 
achieved by compression of said bag between two plates. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein said step of 
filling (30) said gas evacuated bag with gas evacuated powder occurs in 
an 
evacuated chamber, and including the step of transferring said bag to said 

chamber while maintaining vacuum conditions for said bag. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein said 
powder is not exposed to other than vacuum and dry gases after it is dried 

(24). 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein said 
powder is loaded (30) into said bag by a screw conveyor. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein said bag is 
sealed (30) by heat.  

 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein a plurality 
of bags are filled simultaneously during said filling step (30). 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
a plurality of bags are sealed simultaneously during said sealing step (30). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 11, wherein said 
bag is formed with multiple inner compartments and said compartments are 

filled (30) with powder simultaneously. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
a trace amount of helium is injected (30) into said bag after filling of said bag 

with powder and evacuation of said gases and just prior to sealing of said 
bag. 
A method according to claim 14, wherein said amount of helium 
injected (30) into said bag is sufficiently small so as to prevent a pressure 

within said bag from exceeding 1mm Hg.
