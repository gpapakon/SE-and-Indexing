<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to stabilized percarboxylic acid solutions, in particular those which contain, in addition to a percarboxylic acid, the carboxylic acid on which it is based, hydrogen peroxide and at least two stabilizers, and to a process for their preparation. Solutions according to the invention contain, as stabilizers, (a) pyrophosphoric acid or an alkali metal salt or ammonium salt thereof in an amount of 50 to 1000 ppm and (b) a pyridinedicarboxylic acid or an alkali metal salt or ammonium salt thereof in an amount of 5 to 150 ppm, in each case based on the solution. The stabilizer combination is synergistically active; equilibrium peracetic acid stabilized with it meets the criteria of the SADT test "not less than 60@C".

<CLAIMS>
Stabilised percarboxylic acid solutions containing a
mono- or dipercarboxylic acid having 1 to 12 C atoms,

at least one solvent and at least one each of the
stabilisers from the range (a) consisting of

pyrophosphoric acid, an alkali metal salt thereof or
ammonium salt thereof and (b) consisting of

dipicolinic acid or an alkali metal salt thereof or
ammonium salt thereof,

characterised in that

they contain 100 to 500 ppm of a stabiliser from the
series (a) and 5 to 80 ppm of a stabiliser from the

series (b), in each case relative to the solution.
Stabilised percarboxylic acid solution according to
claim 1,

characterised in that

it contains a percarboxylic acid having 1 to 4 C
atoms, in particular peracetic acid, the underlying

carboxylic acid, hydrogen peroxide, water, at least-two
stabilisers and optionally a mineral acid.
Stabilised percarboxylic acid solution according to
claim 2,

characterised in that

it is a peracetic acid at equilibrium, preferably such
an acid having a content of


2.5 to 43 wt.% of peracetic acid
5 to 74 wt.% of acetic acid
1 to 30 wt.% of hydrogen peroxide
10 to 60 wt.% of water
0.05 to 1 wt.% of mineral acid, in particular
H
2
SO
4
.
Stabilised percarboxylic acid solution according to
one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that

it contains disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate (DNPP)
as the stabiliser from group (a).
Process for the production of a stabilised
percarboxylic acid solution containing a mono- or

dipercarboxylic acid having 1 to 12 C atoms and at
least one solvent by adding at least one each of the

stabilisers from the range (a) consisting of
pyrophosphoric acid, an alkali metal salt thereof or

ammonium salt thereof and (b) consisting of
dipicolinic acid or an alkali metal salt thereof or

ammonium salt thereof to the stated solution or to the
solvent or to the reactants of the percarboxylic acid

before the production thereof,

characterised in that

a stabiliser from the series (a) is added in a
quantity of 100 to 500 ppm and a stabiliser from the

series (b) is added in a quantity of 5 to 80 ppm, in
each case relative to the solution.
Process in accordance with claim 5 for the production
of a stabilised percarboxylic acid solution according

to claim 2,

characterised in that

a carboxylic acid having 1 to 4 C atoms, in particular
acetic acid, is reacted with aqueous hydrogen peroxide

in the presence of a strongly acidic catalyst, in
particular sulphuric acid, wherein the stabilisers are

added to one of the starting materials or to the
reaction mixture before, during and/or after the

reaction.
