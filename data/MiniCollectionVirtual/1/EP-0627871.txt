<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronic supply for igniting and operating a 
high-pressure discharge lamp, comprising first driven main switching means (HS 1) for 

generating a high-frequency current through inductive means (L)and switching means 
suitable for subsequent current supply through the inductive means when the first main 

switching means are non-conducting. The electronic supply is provided with a 
transformerless level shifter (LS) and with a driver circuit (S) comprising at least switch 

drive means for driving the first driven main switching means. According to the 
invention, the switching means suitable for subsequent current supply form part of 

second driven main switching means (HS 2) which serve for periodic commutation of 
the current through the inductive means, while the level shifter is free from self-induction 

means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic supply for igniting and operating a 
high-pressure discharge lamp, comprising first driven main switching means for 
generating a high-frequency current through inductive means, and switching means 
suitable for subsequent current supply through the inductive means when the first main 
switching means are in the non-conducting state, which electronic supply is provided 
with a transformerless level shifter and with a driver circuit with at least switch drive 
means for driving the first driven main switching means. A circuit arrangement of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is 
known from EP-A-0507398. First switching means and switch drive means in the 
known supply are constructed as (MOS)FETs to reduce losses during operation. The 
level shifter is transformerless, which is an important and favourable feature. Although 
in itself a transformer constitutes an excellent electrical separation, the use of a 
transformer, especially in circuits for the supply and operation of high-pressure 
discharge lamps, has among its disadvantages a comparatively great bulk and a 
comparatively high weight, also in the case of a low power transfer, and a high degree 
of unsuitability for integration. The level shifter is further provided with self-induction 
means for fast switching of the main switching means while switching losses are 
reduced at the same time. The known supply, which is suitable for generating a high-frequency 
current with a frequency of approximately 20 kHz, is of practical use up to 
frequencies of approximately 50 kHz. At frequencies above 50 kHz, however, the 
inevitable losses are found to assume unacceptable proportions. These losses are formed 
to a major extent by dissipation of energy stored in parasitic capacitances of the switch 
drive means during periodic switching into conduction of the switch drive means. The use of high frequencies to above 200 kHz, however, is desirable. On 
the one hand, the use of such high frequencies renders it possible to use small inductive 
means. On the other hand, the use of high frequencies is favourable for preventing  
 
instabilities in lamp operation caused by acoustic resonances. This is of major 
importance, particularly where high-pressure sodium lamps and metal halide lamps are 
concerned. The invention has for its object to provide a measure by which an 
electronic supply is rendered suitable for operation at high frequencies to above 200 
kHz. A circuit arrangement according to the invention is
