<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a curable rubber 
composition having improved water-resistant adhesion to a 
porous substrate. In the field of curable compositions, particularly 
sealants, it has been necessary to apply a primer for assuring 
sufficient adhesion between a substrate and a sealant. As is 
well known, the primer to be applied must be selected properly 
so as to be matched with various sealants and various 
substrates. Besides, application of a primer is complicated 
troublesome operation. Sealants firmly adhering to a substrate 
without primer have thus been demanded. Various studies have 
hitherto been given to techniques for imparting adhesiveness to 
a sealant itself. For example, addition of an amino-containing 
hydrolyzable silicon compound or a reaction product of the 
silicon compound and an epoxy compound has been proposed as 
disclosed in JP-A-59-24771 and JP-B-62-35421. ("JP-A" and "JP-B" 
used herein mean Japanese Patent Publication without 
examination, and after examination, respectively.) However, 
these techniques, when applied to porous substrates, such as 
mortar, concrete, lightweight expanded concrete, and stone, 
still involve the problem that water is apt to penetrate into 
the substrate through the pores especially when the substrate  
 
is soaked in water and the sealant easily separates from the 
interface. Thus, it is the object of the present invention to provide a 
curable composition which firmly adheres to a substrate without 
primer and is prevented from greatly reducing the adhesion even 
when soaked in water. This object has been achieved by the surprising finding that an 
oxyalkylene polymer having a silicon atom-containing group to which a 
hydroxyl group or a hydrolyzable group is bonded (hereinafter 
referred to as a reactive silicon group) and capable of 
crosslinking on formation of a siloxane bond, wherein the 
oxyalkylene polymer has added thereto a specific hydrolyzable 
silicon compound as an active component, exhibits strong 
adhesion in a dry state to a porous substrate, such as mortar 
and stone, as well as metals, glass and coated surfaces and 
markedly improved water-resistant adhesion over conventional 
curable compositions. The present invention relates to a curable composition 
containing (a) 100 parts by weight of an oxyalkylene polymer 
having a silicon atom-containing group to which a hydroxyl 
group or a hydrolyzable group is bonded and capable of 
crosslinking on formation of a siloxane bond and (b) from 0.01 
to 20 parts by weight of
