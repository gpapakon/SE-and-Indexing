<ABSTRACT>
A plate-type heat exchanger for liquids comprising a 
plurality of ribbed plates of a first (1,51) and a second (21,62) type 

which are alternately juxtaposed to form flow chambers of a first and 
a second type, some ribs (10,11,12,13,52,53,54,55) of the plates of the 

first type (1,51) forming, in the chambers of the first type, a meander 
flow path duct in the plane of the plates having a length which far 

exceeds the dimensions of the plates (1,21,51,62) and the length of the 
flow chambers of the second type.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plate-type heat exchanger
for liquids, specifically water, being of the type which is used in
so-called compound boilers used at one time for space heating and
dispensing heated water.It also relates to the heat exchanging plates forming such
exchangers.It is known that in compound systems, a boiler is arranged
to heat the water in a closed primary circuit, which water is circulated,
usually by means of low-head pumps, through the heating system and
simultaneously supplied to the primary branch of a heat exchanger
having a secondary branch connected to the water supply.The output of the secondary branch is connected to the home
hot-water distribution network.A heat exchanger for such an application is to meet several
conflicting requirements:
   it should be quite compact, possess high exchange efficiency,
and produce limited pressure drops, especially across the primary
circuit.In addition, it should ensure, especially in the secondary or
"sanitary" circuit, because intended for delivering drinking water, a
liquid flow which is as uniform as possible and can ensure an evenly
distributed formation of calcareous deposits, as are unavoidable or only
avoidable through the use of expensive softening equipment.The liquid flow through the sanitary circuit is to also ensure
effective and full removal of scale on the occasion of periodical
servicing, that should desirably be kept to a minimum.Plate heat exchangers have been known for this kind of
application which are formed by a plurality of identical plates
juxtaposed and attached to one another to form a bank of chambers
consisting of first and second sets of adjacent chambers to one
another, with the chambers of one set being communicated together
through two sets of input and output openings, respectively, and with
each chamber in the first set intervening between two chambers in the
second set excepting the end chambers in the bank.
The plates are generally rectangular in shape, designed for upright 
installation, and have a plurality of raised ribs on the plate face, which
ribs are formed by deep drawing and generally arranged in a chevron
pattern along the direction of greater length or in a diagonal pattern.The plates, which are identical with one another, are
juxtaposed to one another with the rib elevation pointing in the same
direction throughout, but the chevron pattern pointing alternately in
one and the opposite directions.Thus, chambers are obtained which are identical with one
another and formed by two

<CLAIMS>
A plate-type heat exchanger wherein a plurality of
ribbed plates are juxtaposed and secured to one

another to form a bank of chambers consisting of
first and second sets of mutually adjacent chambers,

the chambers of each set being communicated to one
another by two sets of respectively inlet and outlet

openings, each chamber of the first set being placed
between two chambers of the second set except the

end chambers in the bank, wherein said bank of
chambers is formed by alternately juxtaposing plates

of a first type (1,51) and a second type (21,67), the
plates of the first type (1,51) being provided with a

first plurality of parallel ribs
(10,11,12,13,52,53,54,55) being offset from one

another wherein said ribs are raised
above one face of said plate (1,51) and recessed

below the other plate face, so that, on contacting a
corresponding surface of a plate of the second type

(21,67), they form a meander chamber of a first type
lying in the plane of said plates by juxtaposition of

a plate of a second type (21,67) to the face with
raised ribs of said first type plate (1,51), and a

chamber of a second type with no meander in the plane
of said plates by juxtaposition of a plate of the 

second type (21,67) to the face with recessed ribs of
said first type plate (1,51), both plate types being

provided with a second plurality of ribs
(15,17,18,19,20,31,32,33,34,35) arranged likewise on

either plate types, whereby on juxtaposing the two
plate types in an order whatever said second

plurality of ribs form a labyrinth chamber extending
perpendicularly to the plane of said plates.
A heat exchanger as in claim 1, wherein said surface
of contact with said first plurality of ribs is the

flat surface of said plate of the second type.
A heat exchanger as in claim 1, wherein said surface
of contact with said first plurality of ribs is the

tip of a third plurality of raised ribs on said
second-type plate projecting in the opposite

direction from that of said first plurality of ribs.
A heat exchanger as in claims 1, 2, 3, wherein said
second plurality of ribs comprises a first set (17)

of elongate ribs extending in a transverse direction
to the direction of flow through said meander

chamber. 
A heat exchanger as in claim 4, wherein said second
plurality of ribs comprises a second set (19) of

elongate ribs extending in the direction of flow
through said meander chamber.
A plate (21,67) for a plate-type heat exchanger as
claimed in claim 1, said plate (21,67) having a rim

with two opposed side walls (155,56) of greater
length and two opposed side walls of lesser length

and four openings (22,23,24,25) located at corners of
said plate (21,67), wherein said plate comprises:


a plurality (57,58,59,60,68,69,70,71,72) of sets
of ribs extending in juxtaposition one another,

each set forming a band of ribs extending between
said opposed side walls of greater length (155,56)

at least one of said bands being spaced from
adjacent bands by a spacing flat portion

(62,63,64,65,73,74,75,76) of said plate extending
from a side wall of greater length (155,56)

towards the opposite one, said ribs being slanted
relative to the direction of said greater length

side walls (155,56), wherein said
ribs are raised above one face of said plate

(21,67) and recessed below the other plate face.
A plate (51) as claimed in claim 1, comprising a
plurality of ribs (52,53,54,55)raised above one face

of said plate and recessed below the other face
plate, each rib extending in one of said flat

portions (62,63,64,65) spacing said rib bands,
alternately from one or the other of said side walls

(155,56) of greater length to section of said flat
portion intermediate to 
said side walls of greater
length, so as to form a meander path in the plane of

said plate.
A plate according to claims 6 or 7, wherein said ribs

(57,58,59,60,61,68,69,70,71,72) extend at least in
proximity of said flat spacing portion with slanting

transverse to the direction of the ribs in the other

band of the pair.
A plate according to claims 6,7,8, wherein said plate
has a rectangular shape.
A plate according to claim 9, wherein at least
said two side walls of greater length (155,56) of said

rim are convex and form a cone-shaped surface for
coupling of adjacent plates.
