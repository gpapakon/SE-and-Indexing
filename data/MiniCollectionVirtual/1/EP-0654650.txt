<ABSTRACT>
An aiming telescope has an inner tube mounted within 
the main tube on the eyepiece side, e.g. with a ball-and-socket 

joint, for receiving the inversion system and the 
reticle. For adjusting the reticle a pair of adjusting 

spindles disposed at right angles to each other are provided, 
the restoring forces being applied by a spring which 

is supported on the ball of the ball-and-socket joint at a 
distance from the center of the ball, on the one hand, and 

on the main tube, on the other hand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aiming telescope
having a main tube with eyepiece and objective
in which an inner tube is mounted with a joint on the
eyepiece side for receiving an inversion system and a
reticle, a pair of adjusting spindles disposed on the main
tube at an angle to each other and acting on the inner
tube at a distance from the joint, and at least one spring
for urging the inner tube against the adjusting spindles.Such aiming telescopes are known. They permit the
reticle to be moved relative to the weapon so that it can
be brought into agreement with the meeting point. Since
reticle and inversion system are shifted jointly relative
to the target imaged by the objective the reticle remains
in the center of the visual field, regardless of the necessary
adjusting motion (centered reticle). The adjusting
motion is started by the pair of adjusting spindles disposed
at right angles to each other. To produce the necessary
restoring force one normally uses one or two
springs disposed between the main tube and the inner
tube at a distance from the joint, i.e. acting perpendicular
to the inner tube axis.The springs disposed between the inner tube and
the main tube restrict the adjusting distance so that the
adjusting distance may be too short if the aiming telescope
is not properly mounted on the weapon. For reasons
of space the spring size is also small compared to
the relatively large adjusting distances, resulting in great
variations in spring force over the adjusting distance.
Furthermore, a relative motion occurs between spring
and main tube or inner tube, leading to frictional losses
and at the same time to a danger of the optical system
being soiled by abrasion. In addition, the inner tube can
only be assembled with a prestressed spring, which increases
the assembly effort.US-A-2,580,280 discloses an aiming telescope
having a joint formed by a space bar which has a tongue
which is received in a slot of a flange on the objective
side of an inner tube housing the reticle. The inner tube
is urged towards the space bar by a coiled spring coaxially
arranged in a section of the main tube having an
enlarged diameter to react between the flange of the inner
tube and a ring at the objective. The inversion system
is fixed to the main tube between the inner tube and
the eyepiece, so that the reticle is not centered.The invention is therefore based on the problem of
providing an aiming telescope with a centered reticle,
which telescope is easily assembled and has a large adjusting
distance and
