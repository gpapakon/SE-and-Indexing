<DESCRIPTION>
The present descriptive memory refers to a patent of 
invention, comprising an oil liquefied gases telemetering 
system, which obvious object is the reading of the filling 
level of a deposit containing the concerned gases, the 
treatment thereof and its transmission to a data collection 
and data processing centre. Marginally to the level reading, the invention 
comprises other readings of analogue and digital character, 
which correspond to a sensor that indicates the degree of 
the deposit corrosion and to some inputs subdivided in two 
groups named inputs for user and for system, treating these 
inputs in a similar way as in the level reading. In order to make the transmission towards the data 
collection centre, the invention contemplates the 
possibility of making the transmission through the 
switched-over telephone network as either physical support 
or via radio. This invention has its application within the industry 
dedicated to the manufacturing of metering systems in all 
its fields. At present it is known the existence of data 
registration and transmission multiple systems for various 
uses, from the ones constituted by one unit that receives  
 
information from various registering elements, which 
gathers the information and afterwards is transmitted from 
different methods, by direct contact, transported using the 
own supply lines, via radio, etc., etc., to the elements 
that record the data at individual level of each register 
and then the information is transmitted by the methods 
already described or recorded in magnetic supports of all 
kinds, which are physically transported. Nevertheless, any of them solves in one unit all the 
services, due to the fact that the majority of the known 
systems are designed to integrate different information 
sources, such is the case of the supply meters of 
electrical power, gas, water, etc., etc, with the purpose 
of meeting in a circuit that integrates the intelligence 
of the system and the radio unit. These applications or systems remarkably impede the 
systems concerned, as they are obliged to use better 
installations than the ones that would be profitable, in 
relation to the degree of concentration of the meters to be 
read, since the intelligent or concentrating unit, has 
equal cost for a high number of meters to be read, and then 
transmits this reading, than for a reduced number of 
meters. Batz, U.S. patent number 3,967,202, in which
