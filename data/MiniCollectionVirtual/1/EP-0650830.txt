<ABSTRACT>
A plate making device and method, wherein when a 
light sensor detects that the stencil plate inserted into 

the plate making device is provided with the through hole, 
the controller supplies a current to the thermal head for 

T1 seconds to control the heat time to be short, so that 
the perforation energy of the thermal head is reduced. On 

the other hand, when the light sensor detects that the 
stencil plate has no through hole, the controller supplies 

a current to the thermal heat for T2 seconds longer than 
T1 seconds to control the heat time to be long, so that 

the perforation energy of the thermal head is increased. 
In this device, even when any type of stencil plate is 

used, the plate making process providing the best print 
quality for each stencil plate can be performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plate making
device and method, and particularly to a plate making
device and method for forming a perforation image on a
stencil plate with heat-perforating means.A stencil plate as disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 61-72590 has been
hitherto known as an ink-containing stencil plate used for
a stamp device for stencil printing. The stencil plate as
described above will be described with reference to Figs.
10A and 10B.As shown in Figs. 10A and 10B, the stencil plate
50 comprises a heat sensitive stencil paper 54 formed of a
thermoplastic film 51 and a porous supporting member 53,
non-woven cloth 56 serving as an ink-impregnated member, a
frame 57 disposed so as to surround the non-woven cloth
56, and a film 58 serving as an ink-impermeable base
member, all of which are successively laminated. Adhesive
agents 59 are provided between the heat sensitive stencil
paper 54 and the frame 57. Adhesive agents 52 are
provided between the thermoplastic film 51 and the porous
supporting member 53.A perforation image is formed on the thus-constructed
stencil plate 50 by heat-melting the
thermoplastic film 51 of the heat sensitive stencil paper
54 with a stamp device using a thermal head, for example
(see reference numeral 1 in Fig. 2) (formation of a
perforation image is hereinafter referred to as "plate
making"). The plate-made stencil plate 50 is installed
into a stamp member 60 shown in Fig. 11(see Fig. 2), and
stencil printing is performed by pushing the stamp member
60 against a print sheet 70. The stamp member 60 includes
a grip 61, a cushion layer 62, and an adhesive layer 63. EP-A-0589710, relevant by virtue of Article 54(3) EPC
only, discloses a stencil producing apparatus which is
capable both of stencil production and thermal printing. A
switch, operable by the operator, is provided for selecting
stencil production or printing and the thermal head is
controlled accordingly.EP-A-0512804
is concerned with
the problem that there is a variation in the viscosity of
ink caused by changes in the environmental temperature of
the stamp device. To enable the stamp device to produce
uniform images the perforations in the heat sensitive
stencil paper are varied according to the temperature.
This is achieved by detecting the temperature of the stamp
device and varying the current supply time of the thermal
head in accordance with the ink temperature.Through experiment, it has been determined that
the ink used for the stencil plate 50 as described above
has
