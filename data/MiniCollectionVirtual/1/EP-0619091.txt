<ABSTRACT>
At least one end of the holder bar (1) has an axially protruding coupling rod (4) of smaller cross-section and movable and fixable axially in relation to the holder bar. The coupling rod free end protruding beyond the holder bar has couplings, in the form of an external thread, or a smooth plug or clamping part, joining it to an adjacent bar and/or support (3) or wall attachment. A threaded sleeve (5) inside the holder bar has an inner opening matching the coupling rod outer section. A clamping, grub screw (6) fixes the holder bar to the coupling rod which goes through a hole (9) in a radially inner part of a cap (8) covering the holder bar end.

A retainer bar for retaining and/or reinforcing 
partitions (2) for shower stalls, whereby the 

retainer bar (1) has fastening elements permitting 
fastening directly to the partition (2) or partition 

frame and/or indirectly to a mounting rail supporting 
the partition (2) or to a support (3), 
characterized 
in that
 the retainer bar (1) has, at least at one of 
its end faces, an axially projecting coupling bar (4) 

whose cross section is smaller than that of the 
retainer bar (1), that the free projecting end of the 

coupling bar (4) has coupling means for connecting to 
a neighbouring bar and/or to a mounting rail (3) or 

wall mount (3a), and that the coupling bar (4) is 
adjustable in an axial direction relative to the 

retainer bar (1) and is adapted to be located in 
position. 
A retainer bar as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the coupling bar (4) has at its projecting 

coupling area coupling means in the form of an 
external thread or a plug-in and clamping zone, 

particularly a smooth one. 
A retainer bar as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the coupling bar (4) is movable 

in the longitudinal direction of the retainer bar (1) 
and is adapted to be located in position. 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the interior of the retainer 

bar (1) is formed with a sleeve (5) or has an 
inserted sleeve (5) whose internal opening  

 
corresponds approximately to the external cross 

section of the coupling bar (4). 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the sleeve (5) is a threaded 

sleeve relative to which the coupling bar (4) is 
axially adjustable and fixable by screwing threaded 

sleeve together with a thread on the coupling bar 
(4). 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the sleeve (5) is a sliding 

sleeve relative to which the coupling rod (4) is 
fixable particularly by means of clamping, for 

example with at least one clamping screw (6). 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the clamping screw(s) (6) 

for fixing the coupling bar (4) on the retainer bar 
(1) is(are) a grub screw(s) engaging with the 

retainer bar (1) particularly vertically from the top 
in the position of use. 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that coupling bar (4) is angled 

and/or curved in its region situated outside the 
retainer bar (1). 
A retainer bar as claimed in claim 8, characterized 
in that the curvature or angularity of the coupling 

bar (4) forms an obtuse or right angle. 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that arranged, preferably in a 

detachable fashion, at the end face of the retainer  
 

bar (1) is a cap (8) which bridges the difference in 
cross section or diameter between retainer bar (1) 

and coupling bar (4) and shields the end face of the 
retainer bar (1) particularly against splash water. 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that the area of the cap (8) 

which is situated radially internally and has an 
aperture (9) for the passage of the coupling bar (4) 

bears clampingly or sealingly against the coupling 
bar (4). 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
11, characterized in that the coupling bar (4) is 

fastened to the retainer bar (1) in an exchangeable 
condition. 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
12, characterized in that the the coupling bar (4) 

has a plurality of legs, for example has a T-shape or 
cross-shape, particularly for coupling a plurality of 

shower stalls or for fixing branches or 
intersections, whereby in each case one member of a 

T-shaped or cross-shaped coupling element fits into 
the end face of a retainer bar (1) or into the 

complementary coupling of a mounting rail (3). 
A retainer bar as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
13, characterized in that the retainer bar (1) 

together with its coupling bar (4) is vertically 
adjustable relative to a support (3) or wall mount 

(3a) and is adapted to be located in position. 
A retainer bar as claimed in claim 14, characterized 
in that the coupling bar (4) penetrates a slot (3b)  

 
in the support (3) or in the wall mount (3a) and 

engages with a coupling element (3c) inside the 
hollow support (3) or inside the hollow wall mount 

(3a), which coupling (3c) is adapted to be located in 
position by means of clamping screw (3d) and, after 

the clamping screw (3d) has been unscrewed, is 
movable relative to the support (3) or wall mount 

(3a) and is fixable.
