<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is an improved hard-coating process using a polyol in the powdered state and permitting the easy and rapid creation of a hard coating at the surface of a product. This process consists, on the one hand, in applying a syrup containing at least 90% of a polyol chosen from sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol and isomalt and, on the other hand, in the application in powdered form, of a quantity of powder having a purity greater than 95% with respect to the same polyol, these applications being performed without carrying out a forced drying.

<CLAIMS>
Hard coating smoothing or gumming process,
enabling the creation of a hard coating on the surface of

a product by panning, and having at least one cycle
comprising:


a stage of application of a syrup composed of at
least 90% by weight in relation to its soluble dry matter

of a polyol chosen from amongst sorbitol, maltitol,
mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, lactitol and isomalt,
at least one stage of application in powder form,
of a powder which has a purity higher than 95% by weight

with respect to this same polyol; the said application
stages being carried out in any order,
then a stage during which the applied syrup and
powder are spread evenly,

   characterized in that this cycle does not comprise
a stage of forced drying by air flow.
Hard coating process according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the powder applied has a purity

higher than 98%, preferably higher than 99%.
Hard coating process according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the syrup applied is prepared from

the polyol powder applied.
Hard coating process according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the syrup comprising the powder

applied also contains 0.5 to 5% of gelatine, gum arabic or
modified celluloses and possibly 0.5 to 2% of pigments such

as calcium carbonate, titanium oxide or a food solvent.
Coating process according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the product to be coated or already

coated is a food product, a product for animals, a
pharmaceutical or veterinary product, a dietetic product,

a seed or grain, a fertilizer powder or an additive based 
on enzymes, microorganisms, vitamins, flavourings,

perfumes, acids, sweeteners or active ingredients.
