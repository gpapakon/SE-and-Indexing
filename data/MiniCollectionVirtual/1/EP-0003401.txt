<ABSTRACT>
A cutter assembly and a cutting machine including such 
a cutter assembly for successively removing pieces from a 

workpiece (12) in which two cutter members (28, 30) within a 
housing (21) are movable relative to each other to perform
 
a cutting action, and an opening (32) is provided in the 

housing (21) through which the workpiece (12) can be 
inserted in use to be cut by the cutter members (28, 30). 
The machine is arranged to move relative to the 
workpiece (12), and means, such as a vacuum system, is 

provided to remove swarf from the workpiece (12) so that 
contamination of the workpiece (12) can be avoided. Wear of 

the cutting edge (29) is evened out by using a circular cutter 
(28) which is indexed round before each cut. 
Preferably the cutting machine and its cutter assembly 
are arranged to operate remotely without the need for 

manual intervention, and are particularly suitable for cutting 
through an elongate lip weld between two sheets of metal.
