<ABSTRACT>
Selection device (1) making it possible to bring at least one object, for example a substrate, to a processing station (23) comprising an object holder (16) mounted so as to turn on a support (3) and having regions (22) for accommodating objects to be processed which are able to be brought successively to the said processing station, a force-accumulating element (19) linked to the said object holder and tending to make this object holder turn in one direction, an incrementation mechanism (26) which has, on one hand, stop means (27) provided on the said support and, on the other hand, limit-stop forming means (33) provided on the said object holder and associated respectively with the said accommodation regions, the said stop means being capable of interacting successively with the said limit-stop forming means in order to hold the said plate (16) at successive positions such that the said accommodation regions are situated successively at the said processing station, and triggering means (38) acting on the incrementation mechanism (26) so that the said stop means pass selectively from one limit-stop forming means to the following limit-stop forming means, after rotation of the said object holder under the effect of the said force-accumulation element (19).
