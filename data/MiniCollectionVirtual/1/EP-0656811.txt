<ABSTRACT>
A carbonylation catalyst useful for the carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid, acetic anhydride or both comprises a polymer support containing pendant pyrrolidone groups which support a rhodium species. Other polymeric supports capable of withstanding carbonylation temperatures of at least 150  C are disclosed for the carbonylation reaction in which rhodium levels in the reaction medium of greater than 500 ppm are contemplated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a novel catalyst useful in the carbonylation of 
methanol to acetic acid, carbonylation of methyl acetate to acetic anhydride or both. Among currently-employed processes for synthesizing acetic acid, one of the most 
useful processes commercially is the rhodium-catalyzed carbonylation of methanol with carbon 
monoxide as taught in U.S. 3,769,329, issued to Paulik et al on October 30, 1973, and known as 
the "Monsanto process". Although the Paulik et al patent discloses that the rhodium catalyst can 
be used dissolved or otherwise dispersed in the liquid medium or else supported on an inert solid, 
commercially, the catalyst is utilized in a homogeneous reaction system in which the rhodium 
catalyst is dissolved in the reaction solvent which typically is acetic acid. The homogeneous 
catalyst system also includes a halogen-containing catalyst promoter as exemplified by methyl 
iodide. The reaction is conducted by continuously bubbling carbon monoxide gas through the 
liquid reaction medium. Paulik et al teach that the liquid reaction medium can include any solvent 
compatible with the catalyst system and that it may comprise, for example, the pure alcohol 
which is being reacted or mixtures thereof with the desired carboxylic acid end product and/or 
esters of these two compounds. The preferred solvent and liquid reaction medium for the process 
is the desired carboxylic acid itself, i.e., acetic acid when methanol is being carbonylated to 
produce acetic acid. The Paulik et al patent also discloses that the addition of water enhances the 
reaction rate of the carbonylation of the alcohol to the carboxylic acid. Accordingly, commercial 
formation of acetic acid using the Monsanto process technology as disclosed in Paulik et al utilize  
 
over 14 to 15 wt.% water in the reaction medium. This has been characterized as the "high 
water" carbonylation process. Unfortunately, recovering acetic acid in anhydrous or nearly 
anhydrous form from such an appreciable quantity of water involves substantial expenditure of 
energy in distillation and/or additional processing steps such as solvent extraction, as well as 
requires larger purification process equipment as compared with that used in purifying carboxylic 
acid containing significantly lower quantities of water. Thus, while reactor output of acetic acid 
is highly efficient at high reactor water concentrations, production capacity is typically limited 
by water removal capability from the acetic acid product. An
