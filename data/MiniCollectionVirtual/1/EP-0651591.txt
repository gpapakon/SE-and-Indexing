<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrode system for fusion and stirring as well as for temperature control in metallurgical vessels. For the purpose of optimum coupling in of power in conjunction with minimum gas consumption, the electrode system is characterised according to the invention by a central electrode (10) and a jacket electrode (11), which are each attached to a height adjusting means (12) and are connected to a common current source (16), in order to form an arc between the central electrode and the melt underneath the molten bath surface, and by an annular space (23) between the central electrode (10) and the jacket electrode (11), which space is connected to a gas source (25), the gas system being designed in such a way that fine-grained additives can also be charged into the melt.
