<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a multilayer material for 
making packages adequate for containing dry materials, 

which exhibits a superior moisture protection and prevents 
the migration of greasy compounds through an ethylene 

vinyl alcohol copolymer barrier layer. This migration, 
beyond leading to stains and poor aesthetics, can 

jeopardize the strength of the package container. The 
multilayer material of the present invention is glued 

together for reforming into a packaging container, and 
not, as more commonly, heat sealed. To achieve this aim, 

the EVOH layer is sandwiched in between two layers of 
cardboard or paper. In this way the cardboard or paper 

layers of this multilayer material constitute the 
outermost layers. In reforming said multilayer material 

into a packaging container, starting from a single blank, 
the inner part of said container, made of cardboard or 

paper, can now be glued onto the outer part of said 
container, also made of cardboard or paper. The present 

invention does not need therefore more sophisticated 
assembling techniques, such as for example heat sealing, 

for the reforming into a packaging carton.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multilayer materials
for reforming into package containers with state of the
art glues, which adequately protect moisture sensitive
compounds and prevent the migration through the wall of
greasy compounds. This material is particularly suitable
for making containers for dry laundry and household
cleaning compositions. A wide variety of single-use type packaging materials
are known, the so-called disposable cartons. Many of said
packaging materials are in the form of multilayers
comprising different materials in order that the composite
material may present a desired combination of properties
otherwise not available from a single layer of a single
composition.For packaging cartons, known multilayers generally
comprise at least one stiffening layer, such as cardboard,
which also reliably retains scores and folds therein. The
other layers can be variably chosen in function of the
protection needed for the contained material. In
particular, for dry laundry compounds, which sometimes are
moisture sensitive compositions, the disposable cartons
consist of a multilayer material comprising generally an
aluminum foil coated to cardboard or paper.The disposable cartons comprising a layer of aluminum
foil possess extremely barrier properties. However, this
type of multilayers is becoming more and more
controversial from the environmental viewpoint.Consequently, the packaging technology has long been in
need of being able to develop an aluminum-free packaging
material, that uses materials offering high barrier
characteristics, but conferring greater environmental
advantages to the multilayer material.From CH-A5- 610 570 it is known that ethylene vinyl
alcohol copolymer (abbreviated as EVOH) or mixtures of
EVOH with other thermoplastic polymers is a good barrier
material for gases in general, oxygen in particular. This 
material is directly used to preserve liquids or foods in
general.Various multilayer materials comprising EVOH and
mixtures thereof have been described in EP-A- 245 921,
Gibbsons et al., published November 19, 1987; EP-A- 423
511, Löfgren et al., published April 24, 1991; WO-92/01558,
Flom, Atle, published February 6, 1992. The
containers formed by these multilayer materials present
several layers to achieve different protection of the
contained material, from an oxygen barrier to a flavour
barrier, always comprising at least a stiffening layer
made of cardboard or paper. The EVOH or other
thermoplastic polymers are laminated always as one of the
outermost
