<ABSTRACT>
A medical site (10,60,80) having a needleless 
connector access port (20) including a flush mounted valve 

assembly (32,38) which is ready accessible for wiping 
clean with a disinfectant. A male luer connector (28) may 

be operatively connected into the access port (20) by a 
split luer of female luer connector portions (46,48,66,68) 

adjacent the access port aperture (24). The split luer 
does not generally obstruct wiping access to the access 

port and may include moveable connector portions (62, 64, 
86, 88) to provide completely unobstructed wiping access 

thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medical sites, in 
particular to sample sites through which fluids are 
injected or withdrawn from a patient's circulatory system 
and, more particularly, to a sample site which does not 
require use of a needle for injecting or withdrawing 
samples and in which the access port is easily reached for 
disinfecting. Sample sites for obtaining fluid access to a 
patient's circulatory system are well known. For example, 
a catheter inserted into a patient's blood vessel may be 
connected to a sample site such as shown in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,874,377, the disclosure of which is fully 
incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the 
sample site may be in-line with tubing connecting the 
catheter to a blood pressure monitoring transducer and/or 
a supply of saline or other solution, such as shown in 
U.S. Patent 5,148,811, entitled "Method and Apparatus for 
Sampling Blood", and which is a continuation-in-part of 
U.S. Patent No. 5,048,537, the disclosures of which are 
fully incorporated herein by reference. Typical of such sites is that they include a 
housing having a liquid path extending therein and which 
is to be coupled to the patient's circulatory system to 
make the fluid connection such as through a catheter 
and/or the tubing of an intravenous system, for example, 
like the blood pressure monitoring apparatus shown in the 
aforementioned U.S. Patents 5,148,811 and 5,048,537. A 
sample site further typically includes an access port 
through which fluids may be introduced into the patient's 
circulatory system or from which blood may be withdrawn 
from the patient, both via the liquid path. By way of 
example, a needle may be received through a resilient 
stopper in the access port and on into the liquid path to 
couple a syringe or the like attached to the needle with 
the patient's circulatory system for injection/withdrawal 
of fluids. However, sampling sites requiring use of a 
needle present significant risk from needle sticks. As  
 
will be readily appreciated, needle sticks provide a 
mechanism for transfer of dangerous diseases, such as 
hepatitis or AIDS. To reduce risk of needle sticks, sampling sites 
have been developed which eliminate needles. Such 
sampling sites provide an access port adapted for 
needleless connection with an external fluidic system such 
as a syringe or tubing. To this end, a cylindrical 
reservoir is provided on the sample site to provide a 
confined conduit between the needleless connector such as 
a male luer connector and a valve

<CLAIMS>
A medical site (10,60,80) for use with a medical 
male luer connector (28) having a blunt male luer taper 

(26), the site (10,60,80) comprising a housing (12), a 
liquid path (14) extending into the housing, an apertured 

exterior wall (22) on the housing through which the luer 
taper (26) enters the housing (12) to make fluid 

connection to the liquid path, seal means (38) presenting 
an outer surface (40) exposed adjacent the exterior wall 

aperture (24) for normally sealing the aperture (24) 
against fluid communication with the liquid path, the seal 

means outer surface (40) being openable under pressure of 
the luer taper (26) passing into the aperture (24) whereby 

to permit fluid connection thereof with the liquid path, 
the seal means outer surface (40) resealing after removal 

of the luer taper (26), and, female luer connector 
portions (54,74) extending from the housing (12), 

characterised in that the male luer connector (28) has a 
threaded locking cuff (58) about the taper (26), in that 

the female luer portions (54,74) are positioned such as to 
threadably mate with threads on the threaded locking 

cuff (58) with the luer taper (26) extending through the 
aperture (24), and, in that the seal means (38) may be 

cleaned by wiping across the seal means outer surface (40) 
and adjacent portions of the housing exterior wall (22). 
A medical site (10,60,80) for use with a medical 
male luer connector (28) having a blunt male luer 

taper (26), the site (10,60,80) comprising a housing (12) 
having an aperture (24), a valve element (38) retained by
