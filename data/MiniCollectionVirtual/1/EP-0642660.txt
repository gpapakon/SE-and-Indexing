<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses an improved method for determining both oxygenate content and octane of hydrocarbon fuels suitable for automotive vehicles. It has been discovered possible by selecting nanometer frequencies in the range 1,300 to 1,350 to reduce the temperature dependence of calibration equations that predict values representative of both oxygenate content and octane by using only derivatives of selected temperature-dependent frequencies in addition to those in the 1,300 to 1,350 nanometers range. The selected frequencies primarily correspond to C-H vibrational modes.

<DESCRIPTION>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 506391, filed April 9, 1990; U.S.
Patent 4,963,745, issued October 16, 1990, relates to the general field of
the present invention, as does U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
698,411, filed May 10, 1991; and U.S. Patent 5,145,785, issued September
8, 1992, relates also to this general field of the present invention.This invention relates to the determination of physical or chemical
properties of compositions by means of near-infrared absorption bands.
More specifically, this invention relates to compositions that involve
hydrocarbons and substituted hydrocarbons, along with oxygenates such
as ethers and alcohols. Still more specifically, this invention relates to
octane determinations of oxygenate-containing fuels and percents by
volume or by weight of oxygenate content of such fuels.Oxygenate content for purpose of this specification and claims
includes the oxygen that would be contained in hydrocarbons. Examples
of typical oxygen-containing hydrocarbons that are particularly useful for
automotive fuels are: alcohols, such as ethanol, methanol, butanol, 
iso-butanol, t-butanol, and iso-amyl alcohol; and ethers, such as
methyl t-butyl ether, ethyl t-butyl ether, methyl iso-amyl ether, and ethyl
iso-amyl ether.The prior art as shown in the following U. S. patents shows that it
is possible to find near-infrared absorption bands which correlate with
octane. Note in this regard, European Patent Application 88301646.1 of
BP Oil International Limited, filed February 25, 1988. Heat content of
certain fuel compositions and number of methyl groups per molecule
were also shown to be correlatable to certain near-infrared absorption
bands.Use of indirect multi-variable calibration equations for quality
control of agricultural products by near-infrared spectroscopy,"
G. Puchwein and A. Eibelhuber (Mikrochim. Acta) Wein), (1986; II
43-51) teach a computer program for calibrating an instrument. The
program picks relevant frequencies for spectral data for part of a set of
samples with which to calibrate an instrument and then validates with
respect to the remaining samples not used to establish to calibration.A near-infrared regression model for octane measurements in
gasoline which contain MTBE was published in a book of proceedings
by the American Chemical Society, Division of Fuel Chemistry, in
Volume 35, Number 1, Pages 266-275 which was written by Steven M.
Maggard and also presented by him at the 199th American Chemical
Society National Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts on April

A method for determining alcohol content of an at
least 1% by volume oxygenate-containing composition comprising:


a. measuring absorbance in at least one infrared band in a
range selected from the group of 1300 to 1350 nanometers;
b. transforming said absorbance by a mathematical
transformation;
c. substituting said absorbance so transformed into an equation
which defines a prediction of values representative of alcohol

content of said composition; and
d. controlling blending of said composition in response to said
prediction.
The method of Claim 1 wherein said mathematical
transformation is at least a first order finite difference derivative and

wherein said at least first order finite difference derivative involves a
number of segments in the range 4 to 30 and a gap in the range 0 to 4. 
The method according to Claim 1 for determining
oxygenate content of a composition that comprises at least 1% by

volume of said oxygenate content, wherein the method comprises
using at least one absorption band in the near infrared in the range 1,300

to 1,350 nanometers in a calibration equation that predicts values
representative of oxygenate content, and wherein at least one other

absorption band within the infrared spectrym of said composition is used
which reduces temperature dependence of said values representative of

oxygenate content or which improves the Standard Error of Estimate for
said oxygenate content, and wherein said at least one absorption band

in the near infrared is changed by a mathematical transformation prior
to use in said calibration equation, and wherein said mathematical

transformation of said at least one absorption band in the near infrared
involves a finite difference derivative having a number of segments in the

range 6 to 25 and a gap in the range 0 to 5.
The method according to claims 1 to 3 wherein the
oxygenate content comprises oxygen present in species selected from the

group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol,
iso-butanol, t-butanol, iso-amyl alcohol, t-amyl alcohol, methyl t-butyl

ether, ethyl t-butyl ether, methyl iso-amyl ether, ethyl iso-amyl ether,
methy t-amyl ether, and ethyl t-amyl ether.
