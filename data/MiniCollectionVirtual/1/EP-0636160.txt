<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to sealable and peelable polymer composition which contains 20-80 weight-% polyolefin and 80-20 weight-% ethylene-hydroxyacrylate co- or terpolymer in which as one comonomer is 5-30 weight-% hydroxyacrylate and as another comonomer 0-40 weight-% vinyl compound. The composition is peelable also after heat-processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a peelable polymer blend or compound, a method for 
making the blend or compound and films, sheets and lamination products made from 
the blend or compound. In the packaging industry it is conventional that a product is packaged in a plastic film 
or a rigid plastic package and the package is heat sealed. The seal must possess a 
mechanical resistance sufficient to maintain the tight-seal properties during storage and 
transport. It is required that the package can be opened without destroying the product 
inside but to a growing extend it must also be possible to open the package without 
destroying the integrity of the film itself. The seal must be easily openable with pulling 
by hands without scissors or other instruments, the seal must be peelable. The package 
can also be used after opening for instance as a serving or heating disk (yoghurt, micro-oven 
food) or the whole product is not taken away instantly but is kept in the open 
package ( candies, cereals). The peelable seal can be defined to be the seal or joint between two films or sheets 
produced by heat sealing or impulse sealing, the joint thus formed having the property 
of being openable by pulling with hands. The seal can be between two films or two 
sheets or between a film or sheet and some substrate. Depending on the substrate an 
adhesion layer may sometimes be needed between the substrate and the sheet or film. The use of peelable seals in different packages has come more common with the 
development of packaging technique. There is a special need in the food processing 
industry, where there are applications in all sections, e.g. dairy products (cheeses, 
yoghurt), frozen food products, ready-processed foods, canned foods, meat and meat 
products, different snack and sweet packages. A very fast growing group is ready 
processed foods and canned foods which are heated mainly in microwave oven. A great 
part of packed foods are heat-processed after packaging when the materials and seals 
must resist the processing conditions. On the other hand sterilisable packages are needed 
also elsewhere as in packaging medical instruments. Aluminium films and metallised plastic films are now commonly used in closing the 
heat-processable packages, e.g. containers.  
 In peelable compositions has most commonly been used as one component polybutylene 
and as another ethylene polymer, most often ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) 
or low density polyethylene (LDPE). Also polypropylene can be included in the 
co
