<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is based on the object of avoiding the described disadvantages of the conventional methods for producing colour enlargements. The metering colour exposure system bypasses the respective disadvantages of both methods since adjustable or replaceable filters and different exposure times for the different colours are bypassed. The light sources for the different colours are arranged separate from each other and cannot influence each other. In order to adjust the colour mixture necessary for exposing a print, the beam path of the different colours is covered by one of three diaphragms or by other suitable measures. The cross-section of the beam is thereby changed, the light is metered. In detail, the method based on the invention achieves the following advantages compared to conventional methods:   . no mutual influencing of individual colour filters, thereby reduction in the overall exposure time and higher throughput in the case of industrial photographic printers. . identical exposure time for the three colours and thereby bypassing of a colour distortion as a result of the long-term effect (Schwarzschild effect) or ultra-short effect. (Reciprocity law) . precise and simple colour guidance independently of different exposure times and exposure intervals . as a result of a comparative measurement method, independence of different photographic papers, chemicals and negatives.
