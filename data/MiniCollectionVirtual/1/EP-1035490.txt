<ABSTRACT>
A survey system comprises a supervisor station (1) and a respondent station (3). There
are four distinct stages in which a survey is created (12), issued (14), executed on the

respondent station (3), imported (15), and analysed (17). Questions relate to scales
providing for quantitative responses and control programs are issued. The respondent's

station exports the survey only when completed, and the respondent station takes an
active role in controlling the manner in which responses are received and recorded and it

also performs dynamic tests on the data. The questions are in a structured model format
and this allows meaningful and clear survey results to be outputted from the analysis

stage (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a computerised survey system and control method, in which the
survey system comprises a supervisor station which generates a survey and subsequently
analyses the response and a respondent station which receives respondent replies.Such a system is described in United States Patent Specification no. US5842195
(Dolphin Software Pty. Ltd.). In this system the supervisor station is used as an authoring
tool to generate a succession of questions to provide a questionnaire. The links between
questions are generated as they are authored, and tie questions may have several different
formats. The questionnaire is transmitted as an electronic mail document to each
respondent, who uses his or her computer as a respondent station. A collector in the
supervisor station collates responses as they are received and sends reminders if delays
arise. The survey is deactivated by the supervisor when it is believed that sufficient
responses have been received.This system and method appears to allow transmission of questionnaires to a wide variety
of respondents. However, it appears that it would be difficult to guarantee integrity of the
responses. It also appears that it would be difficult and time-consuming to generate useful
survey results for a large body of respondents such as employees in a large organisation.The invention is directed towards providing a survey system and control method which
provide improved co-ordination for large bodies of respondents such as employees in a
large organisation.Another object is to provide improved flexibility in the analysis of survey responses to
generate survey results as require by a supervisor.A still further object is to provide a survey system which gathers and processes data in a
very comprehensive manner, sufficient to act as an organisational diagnosis profiler
(ODP) which models behaviour and attitudes of personnel in a large organisation.According to the invention, there is provide a method of controlling a computerised
survey system comprising a supervisor station and at least one respondent station, the
method comprising the steps of:-
at the supervisor station generating a plurality of questions, and
transmitting the questions to the respondent station,at the respondent station outputting the questions, receiving responses, and
transmitting the responses to the supervisor station, andat the supervisor station analysing the responses and generating survey
results, characterised in thatthe questions are generated in groups of questions according

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling a computerised survey system comprising a supervisor
station and at least one respondent station, the method comprising the steps of:-


at the supervisor station generating a plurality of questions, and
transmitting the questions to the respondent station,
at the respondent station outputting the questions, receiving responses, and
transmitting the responses to the supervisor station, and
at the supervisor station analysing the responses and generating survey
results, characterised in that,
the questions are generated in groups of questions according to a model
having a fixed structure, and a response scale comprising an interface for

prompting respondent selection of a quantitative value on the scale is
generated for each q
uestion,
the supervisor station issues a survey to the respondent station, the survey
comprising the questions and associated scales and a control program,
the respondent station controls survey operation and generates respondent
data files, and returns a complete survey only when all associated

respondents have responded;
the complete survey is imported into the supervisor station, and
the supervisor station analyses the responses by calculating a mean value
for all valid responses to each question and outputs the mean value in the

survey results.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the model fixed structure is a hierarchy
with questions grouped at terminations.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the survey results are outputted in
reports according to the model.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein scale comprises discrete
response values.
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the scale does not include a median
value.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the survey responses are
stored by the supervisor station in a static database, and the analysis is performed

dynamically using data read from the static database in a plurality of cycles
initiated by a supervisor.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the survey response data is
filtered as it is imported to the supervisor station.
A method as claimed in claims 6 or 7, wherein the analysis step includes
searching respondent profile data captured during the survey to create sub-sets of

the response data.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the respondent station
automatically, and transparently to the respondent, captures auxiliary data relating

to the nature of the respondent's use of the respondent station.
A method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the respondent station automatically
captures reply times.
A method as claimed in claims 9 or 10, wherein respondent station automatically
captures data relating to the respondent use of a help facility.
A method as claimed in any of claims 9 to 11, wherein the respondent station
automatically generates response validity data according to paradox tests.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the questions include
respondent profile questions, and associated response interfaces for recording

quantitative response values, and the analysis step sorts survey results according
to selected profiles.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the issued survey data is in
flat file format and is retained in that format by the respondent station.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the respondent station
performs completion rate control by automatically monitoring the number of user

data files created.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the survey is issued in
folders having dedicated read/write access rights to provide security.
