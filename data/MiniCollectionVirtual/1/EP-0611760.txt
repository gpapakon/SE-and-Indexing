<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compounds based 
on derivatives of arylacetic esters. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to arylacetic ester derivative-based compounds displaying high 
antifungal activity, to a process for preparing them 
and to their use in the agricultural field, as 
fungicides. Therefore, the object of the present invention 
are compounds based on derivatives of arylacetic 
esters having the general formula (I): 
in which: 
-- R¹ and R², which may be the same or different from 
each other, are an either linear or branched C₁-C₆ 
alkyl or haloalkyl group; -- R³ and R⁴, which may be the same or different from 
each other, represent a hydrogen atom, a C₁-C₂ 
alkyl group, a COOR⁵ group in which R⁵ represents 
an either linear or branched C₁-C₆ alkyl group, a 
cyano group, or, taken together, constitute a 
bond;  -- W represents a nitrogen atom, or the 
 
group; -- Y and Q, which may be the same or different from 
each other, represent a nitrite group, an either 
linear or branched C₁-C₆ alkyl or carboalkoxy 
group, a phenyl group, a heterocyclic C₅-C₁₀ group 
in which the heteroatoms are selected from 
oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur, wherein said phenyl, 
heterocyclic, linear or branched C₁-C₆ alkyl or 
alkoxy groups may also be optionally substituted 
with: 
-- halogens, such as chloro, fluoro, bromo, 
iodo; -- linear or branched C₁-C₆ alkyl or haloalkyl 
groups; -- linear or branched C₁-C₆ alkoxy or haloalkoxy 
groups; -- a nitrile group; -- an either linear or branched C₂-C₈ 
carboxyalkyl group; -- a -(V)m-Z group, in which Z stands for: 
-- an either linear or branched C₁-C₆ alkyl 
group, a phenyl group, a heterocyclic 
C₅-C₁₀ group in which the heteroatoms 
are selected from oxygen, nitrogen or 
sulfur, wherein said phenyl, heterocyclic,
