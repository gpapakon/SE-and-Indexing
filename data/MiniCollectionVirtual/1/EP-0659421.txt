<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of alleviating 
one or more menstrual symptoms in a woman comprising 

administering to said woman in need of treatment an effective 
amount of a compound having the formula 


   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, -CH₃, 
-CO-(C₁-C₆ alkyl), or -CO-Ar in which Ar is optionally 

substituted phenyl; and
 

   R² is selected from the group consisting of 
pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneimino and piperidino; or a 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. 
The present invention also provides the aforementioned 
method and further comprises administering to said woman an 

effective amount of at least one pharmaceutical agent selected 
from the group consisting of an analgesic, a diuretic, and an 

antihistamine, and compositions therefore.

<DESCRIPTION>
In women, the normal menstrual cycle is characterized
by numerous neuroendocrine and physiologic changes. In addition
to hormonal variations, body weight and basal metabolic rate
increase during the luteal phase, and reliable although complex
differences among cycle phases have been found in brain
electrical activity and sensory function. However, clinical
observation and controlled studies continue to find that
psychologic and behavioral disturbances are among the most
prevalent symptoms reported by women with menstrual disorders.Psychologic and behavioral symptoms which have been
suggested to occur during menstruation include, for example,
poorer work or school performance, increased napping and time in
bed, increased time at home, avoiding social activities,
decreased efficiency, insomnia, forgetfulness, confusion, poorer
judgement, difficulty concentrating, distractibility, increased
accidents, poorer motor coordination, crying, loneliness,
anxiety, restlessness, irritability, mood swings, depression,
and tension. The effect of these symptoms can be compounded by
physical menstrual symptoms such as, for example, dizziness,
faintness, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, hot flashes, muscle
stiffness, headache, cramps, backache, fatigue, general aches
and pains, and water retention including, for example, weight
gain, skin disorders, painful breasts, and swelling. [See,
e.g., Penland, J.G., etal., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.168(5):1417-1423 (1993)]. Collectively, these and other known
symptoms of menstruation are herein referred to as menstrual
symptoms. Numerous treatments have been suggested for
alleviating or minimizing menstrual symptoms. These include,
for example, variation in total energy intake and consumption of
protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins B and E, magnesium, zinc,
calcium, manganese, and fatty acids, such as linolenic acid
(primrose oil) [see, e.g., Penland, J.G., etal. supra]. Other
treatments include the administration of an analgesic/anti-inflammatory
agent such as ibuprofen in combination with a
diuretic agent and, optionally, an antihistamine such as
pyrilamine maleate (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,888,343).Although these and other treatments are available, a
multitude of women continue to suffer one or more menstrual
symptoms on a monthly basis. Accordingly, the present invention
provides methods for alleviating one or more menstrual symptoms
in women, and compositions therefore.One aspect of the present invention provides a method
of alleviating one or more menstrual symptoms in a
