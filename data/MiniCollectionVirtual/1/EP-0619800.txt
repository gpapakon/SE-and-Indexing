<ABSTRACT>
The application concerns an improved method of producing silico-alumino-phospate catalysts for the conversion of methanol into light olefins such as ethylene and propylene (the MTO reaction). The improved method of synthesis can be used to control chemical composition of the silico-alumino-phosphates, especially the silicon content. In particular, it was found that catalysts can be synthesized that are more stable to deactivation by "coking", which is very important for the design of an MTO process based on the synthesized silico-alumino-phosphates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The application concerns a procedure for the production of crystalline microporous 
silico-alumino-phosphates, especially SAPO-34, with a controlled silicon content. We are familiar from Norwegian Patent No.169 380 (corresponds to US-A- 4 440 871) with 
microporous crystalline silico-alumino-phosphates and a procedure for synthesizing such 
products. These products have a three-dimensional space lattice built up from PO2+, AlO2- and 
SiO2 tetrahedral units, whose most important chemical composition on a water-free basis is: 
mR:(SixAlyPz)O2 
where "R" represents at least one organic template material which is present in the 
intracrystalline pore system; "m" is the number of moles of "R" present per mole of (SixAlyPz) 
O2 and m has a value between 0 and 0.3, the maximum value in each case being dependent 
on the molecular dimensions of the template material and the available pore volume in the 
silico-alumino-phosphate structure in question; "x", "y" and "z" are molar fractions of silicon, 
aluminium and phosphorus respectively, present as tetrahedral oxides. The minimum value of 
"x", "y" and "z" is 0.01, and the maximum value of "x" is 0.98, of "y" 0.6 and of "z" 0.52. The 
minimum value of "m" in the formula above is 0.02. The reaction mixture is achieved by combining at least one part each of the aluminium and 
phosphorus sources in the absence of the silicon source. Then the resultant mixture is reacted 
with  
 
the remaining components to get the total reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is placed in a pressure vessel for shaking then heating under 
autogenic pressure to a temperature of at least 100 °C, and preferably between 100 and 
260 °C, until a crystalline silico-alumino-phosphate is obtained. The product is extracted 
in any appropriate way, for example by centrifuging or filtering. It is generally known that the chemical composition of the silico-alumino-phosphates is 
very important for their physical and chemical properties, including their properties when 
used as catalytic materials. It would therefore be a great advantage if one could use 
production methods for silico-alumino-phosphates where the chemical composition of 
the product can be variably controlled. This is particularly true of the silicon content. 
The known technique makes no allowance for this. In syntheses of SAPO-34 in 
Norwegian patent No. 169 380, for example, there is a poor match between the chemical 
composition of the synthesis gel and the synthesized silico-alumino-phosphate. According to the examples in
