<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus and method for sensing 
the contamination level in an optical storage device and for issuing a 

signal when the contamination exceeds a predetermined value relative to a 
base value. The tracking error signal gain of an optical drive is 

monitored and compared with a base gain. An alert signal is then 
generated if the actual measured gain exceeds a predetermined level 

relative to the base gain, whereupon a cleaning device can be mounted in 
the storage device and optical elements cleaned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical storage device, and in
particular, to a method and apparatus for sensing the contamination level
in an optical storage device and for issuing a signal when the
contamination exceeds a predetermined value relative to a base value.Data storage recording devices for reading from or writing to
optical media, such as rewritable magneto-optical (MO) disks and write
once (WORM) disks, employ a light source to focus a beam of light through
optical elements onto a surface of the media. Light reflected by the
surface is directed back through additional optical elements and onto a
detector which generates electrical signals representative of data
recorded on the media surface. Reflected light is also directed through
optical elements onto another detector (generally a differential
detector) which generates electrical signals used, in conjunction with
two servo systems, to ensure that the light beam remains focused on the
media surface and to ensure that the beam seeks and follows the desired
data track.Because it has not yet been possible to completely seal an optical
drive or to isolate the optical elements from the external environment,
dust, lint, smoke particles and other common air-borne pollutants can
infiltrate the drive and settle on the optical elements. Any cooling fan
in the drive unit accelerates the contamination. As contaminants build
up on the optical elements, the intensity of light reaching the disk and
reaching the detectors is reduced, thereby reducing signal levels,
adversely affecting read, write, seek and tracking performance and
leading to premature failure of the device.Cleaning cartridges, shaped and dimensioned to resemble actual
optical disk cartridges, can be used to clean some of the optical
elements within a drive. Heretofore, however, cleaning has been
performed either at some periodic interval or upon drive failure.
Neither routine is entirely satisfactory. Periodic cleaning which is
dependent upon a human operator to initiate is inconvenient and may tend
to be postponed or forgotten. Periodic cleaning which occurs in an
automated storage and retrieval library environment may be initiated at
an inopportune time and can otherwise consume valuable library resources.
Further, waiting until a drive fails before inserting a cleaning 
cartridge increases the risk of data loss and can lead to undesirable
downtime of the storage system.DE 3,925,902 discloses an apparatus for monitoring a build-up of
