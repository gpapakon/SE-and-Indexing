<CLAIMS>
A deformable flap (1) in a corridor connection between a first 
carriage (3) and a second carriage (4), said flap comprising: 


a first generally triangular panel (5) provided with the 
following: 


on its long vertical side (6), first hinge means (7a, 
7b) fixed to a vertical fixed portion (8) of said corridor connection 

that is secured to said first carriage (3), which means are provided 
with first return means enabling said first panel (5) to be pressed 

against a vertical fixed portion (10) of said corridor connection (2) 
that is secured to said second carriage (4); and 
on its short vertical side (12), first abutment means 
(13) suitable for enabling said short vertical side (12) of the first 

panel (5) to slide on said vertical fixed portion (10) of the 
corridor connection that is secured to said second carriage (4); and 
a second generally triangular panel (4) whose long vertical 
side (15) is provided with second abutment means (16) enabling said 

long vertical side of the second panel (14) to slide on said vertical 
fixed portion (10) of said corridor connection that is secured to 

said second carriage (4); 
 
   the respective diagonal sides (17, 18) of said first panel (5) 

and of said second panel (14) being disposed edge-to-edge, and being 
secured together by means of second hinge means (19a, 19b) fixed 

respectively to said diagonal sides (17, 18) of said first panel (5) 
and of said second panel (11), said second hinge means (19a, 19b) 

being provided with second return means enabling said long vertical 
side (15) of said second panel (14) to be pressed against said 

vertical fixed portion (10) of said corridor connection that is 
secured to said second carriage (4). 
The use of the deformable flap as defined in claim 1 as a left or 
right side-panel in any rail or urban transport intercommunication 

connection subject to at least one relative movement. 
The use of the deformable flap as defined in claim 1 as a floor in 
any rail or urban transport intercommunication connection subject to 

at least one relative movement.  
 
A rail or urban transport vehicle including at least one 
deformable flap as defined in claim 1.
