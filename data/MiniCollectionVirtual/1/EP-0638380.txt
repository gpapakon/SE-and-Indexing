<ABSTRACT>
A self-hardening mold material comprises molding 
sand, polyisocyanate, a specified polyetherpolyol 

mixture, a silicate and a reaction catalyst. The mold 
has good strength and good shake-out upon being 

dismantled with little or no need for mold wash.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mold 
material composition for preparing a mold (sand mold) 
and a method for preparing a mold from said mold 
material composition, and more particularly to a 
material composition for a self-hardening mold having 
a good strength particularly after being left standing 
in the atmosphere at the ordinary temperature and when 
molten metal is poured therein, a good susceptibility 
to disintegration or shake-out in spite of the good 
strength, requiring no mold wash at all or a very 
simple mold wash such as spraying, and to a method 
for preparing a mold from said material composition. A self-hardening mold for preparing a 
casting sand mold for use in the production of 
various metal casting products (which will be hereinafter 
referred to as "mold" or "sand mold") includes 
an organic binder-based self-hardening mold and an 
inorganic binder-based self-hardening mold. Known 
methods based on the organic binder include, for 
example, a method comprising condensation curing a 
furan resin as a binder with a strongly acidic 
hardening agent such as toluenesulfonic acid (Furan  
 
method), a method comprising mixing such three 
components as phenol resin, polyisocyanate and a 
basic catalyst with molding sand and hardening the 
phenol resin through the urethanization reaction with 
the polyisocyanate by the catalyst (Pepset method), 
a method comprising mixing such three components as 
an oil-modified alkyd resin, polyisocyanate and a 
catalyst, for example, a metal naphthenate, with mold 
sand, followed by hardening through the urethanization 
reaction (Linocure method), etc. Known methods based on the inorganic binder 
include, for example, a method for preparing a mold 
by solidifying mold sand by cement (OJ process), a 
method for hardening a sand mold containing sodium 
silicate by introducing a CO₂ gas thereto under 
pressure (CO₂ method), etc. Known mold material compositions for a 
casting sand mold capable of undergoing casting 
without any mold wash include, for example, a mold 
sand composition comprising a furfuryl alcohol 
condensate, polyester resin, etc.; a hardening 
agent for curing the resin such as toluene sulfonic 
acid, etc; a ceramic component such as silicate 
ester, etc.; an isocyanate-based hardening agent for 
curing the ester; a fine refractory powder for 
preventing penetration such as alumina, silica, etc.; 
a heat resistance intensifier such as sodium chloride,  
 
borax, etc.; a molding-improving agent such as 
sugars, dextrin, etc.; and a
