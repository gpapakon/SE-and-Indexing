<ABSTRACT>
A photographic camera including a plurality 
of focal length settings, a chargeable flash device, 

and a mechanism for indicating an exposure ready 
condition at a predetermined state of charge, is 

characterized by means responsive to the focal length 
setting for adjusting the predetermined state of charge 

at which the ready condition is indicated. The state of 
charge is more complete at longer focal lengths to 

ensure sufficient illumination and is less complete at 
shorter focal lengths to reduce wait time. According to 

one feature of the invention, the camera includes 
contact elements having a plurality of discrete 

positions, one each representing a different focal 
length, and the predetermined state of charge is 

adjusted depending on the position of the contact 
elements. The flash ready condition may be signaled by 

a number of different mechanisms including, for 
example, flash ready lights, the extinguishment of 

exposure wait lights, and the release of actuation 
interlocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
photography and more specifically to cameras with 
multiple focal lengths adapted to handle automatically 
a wide range of exposure conditions, some requiring 
flash. Still more specifically, the invention addresses 
difficulties encountered with flash photography at 
longer focal lengths in cameras that also must perform 
to users expectations at shorter focal lengths. It is well known in automatic cameras to vary 
flash intensity with the distance to a subject. Harvey 
U.S. Patent No. 4,470,684, issued on September 11, 
1984, for example, discloses a camera having a range 
finder for determining the subject distance, and a 
control that limits charging of an electronic flash 
device according to such distance. The control saves 
battery power and shortens the wait time between 
exposures whenever the distance is shorter than the 
maximum capabilities of the flash. Approaches of this 
type provide important advantages to photographers, but 
do not address other problems that result from changes 
in focal length not necessarily dependent on distance. Although not common, it is known also to 
sense focal length, and to warn of conditions that are 
likely to result in blurred images. Hauser et al U.S. 
Patent No. 4,124,857, issued on November 7, 1978, is 
one example. The Hauser patent discloses a camera that 
energizes a warning light in the viewfinder when the 
focal length exceeds a predetermined value likely to 
result in blurred images. The warning light is  
 
deactivated when measures are taken to reduce the risk. 
The Hauser approach recognizes design difficulties in 
cameras with multiple focal lengths, but requires 
operator intervention under those conditions most 
likely to result in poor photographs. The present invention addresses difficulties 
encountered in designing automated cameras having 
multiple focal lengths and flash capability. Many 
cameras today energize the flash ready light, or other 
indication of readiness, when the flash is only partly 
charged, typically halfway in the charging cycle. This 
reduces wait time and energy usage in a manner that is 
satisfactory at shorter focal lengths, but may result 
in insufficient illumination at longer focal lengths. 
Other cameras delay the indication of flash readiness 
until the charging cycle is nearly complete. This 
reduces the risk of insufficient illumination at the 
longer focal lengths, but increases the wait time at 
shorter focal lengths. The present invention is directed to 
over

<CLAIMS>
A photographic camera having optical 
elements adjustable for setting a plurality of focal 

lengths, a chargeable flash device for illuminating a 
subject, and a signaling mechanism for indicating an 

exposure ready condition when the flash device reaches 
a predetermined state of charge; characterized in that: 

   said camera includes means for adjusting said 
predetermined state of charge in response to said focal 

length setting. 
The invention according to Claim 1, 
wherein said adjusting means increases said 

predetermined state of charge for longer focal lengths 
compared to said predetermined state of charge for 

shorter focal lengths. 
The invention according to Claim 2, 
wherein said predetermined state of charge for a 

shorter focal length is set for substantially half full 
charge and a predetermined state of charge for a longer 

focal length is substantially full charge. 
A camera according to Claim 1, including 
contact elements having a plurality of discrete 

positions one each representing a different focal 
length, wherein said signaling mechanism is a flash-ready 

light, and said predetermined state of charge is 
adjusted depending on the position of said contact 

elements.

   a zoom lens including optical elements 

moveable between long focal length positions and short 
focal length positions; 

   an contact member moveable with said moveable 
optical elements between a first contact position 

 
representing said long focal length and a second 

contact position representing said short focal length; 
   a flash device including means for 

accumulating electrical charge for discharging said 
flash device; and, 

   means for setting said flash device in 
accordance with the position of said contact member to 

accumulate more electrical charge in said first contact 
position compared to said second contact position. 
A camera according to Claim 5, including 
a plurality of conductive pads one each representing a 

different focal length, and wherein said contact member 
is an electrical contact moveable into engagement with 

said pads by axial movement of said optical elements.
