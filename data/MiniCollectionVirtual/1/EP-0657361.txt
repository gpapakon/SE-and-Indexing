<ABSTRACT>
A stackable plastic container (20) including a body (21) having 
a generally rectangular cross section including a base wall (25), 

sidewalls (22) and end walls (23,24), the width of the sidewalls 
being greater 

than the width of the end walls. The body has a top wall (30) with 
an integral neck (35) defining a dispensing opening. The bottom 

wall (25) has spaced longitudinally extending integral portions (27) 
defining a longitudinal recess (26) extending lengthwise of the 

bottom wall and generally parallel to the sidewall. The top 
wall (30) of the body includes a centrally located longitudinally 

extending projection (31) extending upwardly and defining spaced 
longitudinally extending generally horizontal portions (33) 

lengthwise of the sidewalls such that when one container is 
stacked on another, the longitudinally extending portions (33) of 

the top wall are engaged by the longitudinally extending spaced 
projections (27) on the bottom wall of a container stacked thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plastic containers and 
particularly to plastic containers that may be stacked on one 
another. It has been heretofore suggested that containers have 
been stacked one on another with portions adapted to interengage 
and provide stability. Typical constructions are: U.S. Patent 
2,641,374 showing glass containers; U.S. Patent 2,661,872 
showing metal beer kegs; U.S. Patent 3,214,052 showing plastic 
bottles with handles; U.S. Patent 3,955,705 showing plastic 
drums; U.S. Patent 4,691,828 showing plastic containers; U.S. 
Patent 4,805,793 showing plastic blow molded containers; and 
U.S. Patent 5,002,199 showing plastic containers stackable on 
their sides. Among the objectives of the present invention are to 
provide a stackable plastic container which is light in weight; 
which can be made by extrusion blow molding or injection extrusion 
and blow molding; which has closures with measuring capability; 
and which will effectively permit stacking of one container on 
another.  In accordance with the invention, a stackable plastic 
container including a body having a generally rectangular cross 
section includes a base wall, sidewalls and end walls, the width 
of the sidewalls being greater than the width of the end walls. 
The body has a top wall with an integral neck defining a 
dispensing opening. The bottom wall has spaced longitudinally 
extending integral portions defining a longitudinal recess 
extending lengthwise of the bottom wall and generally parallel 
to the sidewall. The top wall of the body includes a centrally 
located longitudinally extending projection extending upwardly 
and defining spaced longitudinally extending generally 
horizontal portions lengthwise of the sidewalls such that when 
one container is stacked on another, the longitudinally extending 
portions of the top wall are engaged by the longitudinally 
extending spaced projections on the bottom wall of a container 
stacked thereon.  FIG. 1 is a part sectional elevational view of a 
stackable container embodying the invention. FIG. 2 is a top plan view of the container. FIG. 3 is a bottom plan view of the container. FIG. 4 is a fragmentary view showing stacked containers 
taken from the left as viewed in FIG. 1. FIG. 5 is a fragmentary view of stacked containers 
taken from the right as viewed in FIG. 1. FIG. 6 is a fragmentary end view of a modified form 
of container. FIG. 7 is a part sectional view of the container shown 
in FIG. 6. FIG. 8 is a part sectional fragmentary side elevational 
view of a

<CLAIMS>
A stackable plastic container package including 
   a container including a body having a generally 

rectangular cross section including a base wall, sidewalls and 
end walls, the width of the sidewalls being greater than the 

width of the end walls, 
   a closure on said neck, 

   said body having a top wall with an integral neck 
defining a dispensing opening, 

   said bottom wall having spaced longitudinally 
extending integral portions defining a longitudinal recess 

extending lengthwise of the bottom wall and generally parallel 
to the sidewall, 

   said top wall of said body including a centrally 
located longitudinally extending projection extending upwardly 

and defining spaced longitudinally extending generally 
horizontal portions lengthwise of the sidewalls such that when 

one container is stacked on another, the longitudinally extending 
portions of the top wall are engaged by the longitudinally 

extending spaced projections on the bottom wall of a container 
stacked thereon. 
The stackable container package set forth in claim 1 
including a closure on said neck including a base wall and a skirt. 
The stackable container package set forth in claim 1 
wherein said closure includes integral measuring means. 
The stackable container package set forth in claim 3 
wherein said integral measuring means comprises an integral 

frustoconical skirt on said closure skirt. 
The stackable container package set forth in claim 3 
wherein said measuring means comprises an integral cup spaced 

from said closure and connected to said closure, said cup 
receiving said projection on the top wall of a container when 

the container is stacked on another substantially identical 
container. 
The stackable container package set forth in any one 
of claims 1-5 wherein said closure and neck have interengaging 

thread means. 
The stackable container package set forth in claim 6 
wherein said closure includes an outer skirt and an inner skirt 

and said thread means are on said inner skirt. 
The stackable container package set forth in claim 7 
wherein said outer skirt has a greater axial height than said 

inner skirt. 
The stackable container package set forth in claim 8 
wherein at least a portion of said outer skirt is frustoconical.
