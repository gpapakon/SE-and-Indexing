<ABSTRACT>
A gas distributor (5a,5b) for fused carbonates-fuel cells has a 
plurality of conduits (9) juxtaposed to one of the cell flat electrodes 

(3,6); said conduits comprise two longitudinally aligned conduit 
portions (9e,9b), of which one has a cross-section open towards the 

electrode.
 

In addition, two conduits laying side by side in the distributor, 
have their respective open cross-section portions coincident 

respectively with the first and second portions of their longitudinal 
extent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas distributor 
for fused carbonates-fuel cells comprising an 
electrolitic matrix inserted between two flat 
electrodes, the distributor being provided with a 
plurality of gas flow conduits juxtaposed to one of 
said electrodes. Fused carbonates-fuel cells are well known in 
the scientific and research environments, either as 
subject-matter of many publications, either as object 
of patent specifications. These cells, which are basically 
electrochemical batteries, include a porous 
electrolitic matrix containing alkaline metals 
carbonates; the matrix is inserted between a pair of 
flat electrodes, and gases which interact chemically 
with the carbonates present in the matrix are flowed on 
the surface of this latter. Electric power is generated 
from the chemical reactions which take place between 
the gas and the electrolitic matrix. The ideal working condition for these cells, 
as required for satisfactory operation of same, is 
achieved when the gases are conveyed over the matrix 
surface in such a manner that they can be distributed 
all at once and uniformly on the surface.  The cells are usually employed in packages 
for convenient electrical interconnection of the cells 
in series to provide a range of voltages that may suit 
different application conditions; this packaged 
arrangement, however, does not comply with the 
formation of gas flow channels for conducting the gases 
simultaneously and uniformly on the matrix surface. It has been common practice, therefore, to 
provide channels laid parallel to the surfaces to be 
lapped and oriented in such a manner that the flow 
directions of the gases to the cathode and the anode 
are perpendicular to each other. Specifically, distributors for 
fused carbonates-fuel cells are known, which have a set 
of channels, for conveying gases, extending parallel to 
one another and longitudinally being made up of queued 
channel portions; these portions have predetermined 
length and U-shaped cross-section, alternately inverted 
one with respect to the other. Thus, an alternate 
succession is obtained wherein a U-shaped channel 
portion which is open at the top will be followed by an 
inverted upside down portion, open at the bottom 
towards the matrix but having a closed top. In this way, a gas admitted into these 
channels will only contact the matrix along the  
 
open-bottom channel portions. This type of solution has been adopted in 
order to distribute the gas as evenly as possible all 
over the matrix face where the
