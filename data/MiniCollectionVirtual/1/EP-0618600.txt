<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvement of an electrolyte
solution for an electrolytic capacitor and an electrolytic
capacitor using the same, particularly to an electrolyte
solution for an electrolytic capacitor to which specific
inorganic fine particles having a specific surface
structure are added, which can maintain a high electric
conductivity and a high voltage-resistance for a long time
and an electrolytic capacitor using the same.An electrolytic capacitor is generally provided with an
insulating oxide film such as aluminum oxide and tantalum
oxide which is formed as a dielectric layer on an anode,
and also provided with a cathode so that it faces the
anode, both electrodes being interposed by a separator
which retains an electrolyte solution.Said anode is usually subjected to an etching treatment to 
enhance the surface area. The electrolyte solution closely
contacting with the concave and convex surface of the
electrode functions as a substantial cathode. Thus,
electric conductivity and temperature characteristics of
the electrolyte solution become main factors to determine
the electric characteristics of an electrolytic capacitor.A voltage at which the insulating oxide thin film is
destroyed with the increase of the load voltage on the
capacitor is generally regarded as a measure of the
voltage-resistance of the capacitor and so called spark
voltage. If the spark voltage is higher, the voltage-resistance
of the capacitor is higher. The spark voltage
depends on the composition of the electrolyte solution
used. Therefore, the electrolyte solution is an important
element which determines the properties of the electrolytic
capacitor.Conventionally, for the purpose of increasing the spark
voltage while less decrease in the electric conductivity of
the electrolyte solution, adding oxide fine particles to an
electrolyte solution for an electrolytic capacitor has been
known. For example, an electrolyte solution in which
silica fine particles are added (Japanese Provisional
Patent Publication No. 12512/1992) and an electrolyte
solution in which aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, antimony
oxide, tantalum oxide or titanium oxide is added (Japanese
Provisional Patent Publications Nos. 145612/1992 to
145616/1992) are described.However, an electrolyte solution comprising such fine
particles has a disadvantage that it cannot maintain the
high voltage-resistance at a temperature as high as 105 °C,
since the colloid is unstable at such high temperatures and
resulting the short life of a capacitor. It has
