<ABSTRACT>
For producing an essentially toroidal surface (7) on a turned part (1) by machining, provision is made for rotation of the turned part about a first rotation axis (3) and at the same time for rotation of the turning tool (8), used for this machining, about a second rotation axis (10) which passes through the predetermined centre (4) of the circular surface of the torus, which results in the surface (7) to be machined of the turned part (1) during the rotation of the turned part (1) about the first rotation axis (3).
