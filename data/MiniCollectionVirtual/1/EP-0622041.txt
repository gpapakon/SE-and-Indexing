<ABSTRACT>
A boiler (1)(47) for an espresso coffee machine, 
wherein a hollow body (2)(71) made of good heat 

conducting metal defines a chamber (37)(80) for water to 
be heated by means of a shielded electric resistor 

(13)(54), and having a liner (21)(72) made of 
substantially inoxidizable material; the electric 

resistor (13)(54) being located outside the liner 
(21)(72).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a boiler for 
machines for making hot infused beverages, particularly 
espresso coffee. Machines of the aforementioned type are known to 
feature so-called "wet" boilers which normally comprise 
two half shells made of good heat conducting metal such 
as aluminium, and defining a chamber with at least one 
inlet normally communicating with the delivery side of 
an electromagnetic pump, and at least one outlet 
communicating with a vessel containing powder for 
infusion. The chamber normally houses a shielded 
electric resistor for heating a given amount of water 
fed into the chamber by the pump. Boilers of the above type present several 
drawbacks, mainly due to the electric resistor directly 
contacting the water and so inevitably being subject to 
lime deposits requiring frequent cleaning and 
replacement of the resistor; and due to the good heat 
conducting metal also directly contacting the water, so  
 
that, as a consequence of the high in-service water 
temperatures involved, it tends to react with the oxygen 
in the water to form relatively harmful soluble oxides 
which are dissolved in the beverage and so consumed by 
the user. To at least partly eliminate the above drawbacks, 
so-called "dry" boilers have been proposed, which also 
normally comprise two half shells of good heat 
conducting metal such as aluminium. The half shells 
define at least one coiled conduit having at least one 
inlet normally communicating with the delivery side of 
an electromagnetic pump, and at least one outlet 
communicating with a vessel containing powder for 
infusion. A shielded electric resistor is embedded in 
the material of at least one of the half shells, for 
heating a stream of water fed by the pump along the 
coiled conduit. While substantially eliminating the problem of 
lime deposits on the electric resistor, which is no 
longer in direct contact with the water, "dry" boilers 
of the above type in no way provide for eliminating 
metal oxide pollution of the water in that the hot water 
continues to flow in direct contact with the metal 
forming the two half shells. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a boiler for machines for making hot infused 
beverages, particularly espresso coffee, designed to 
substantially eliminate all the aforementioned  
 
drawbacks. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a boiler for machines for making hot infused 
beverages, particularly espresso coffee, and comprising 
at least a hollow body made of good

<CLAIMS>
A boiler for machines for making hot infused 
beverages, particularly espresso coffee, and comprising 

at least a hollow body (2)(71) made of good heat 
conducting metal and presenting a chamber (37)(80) 

containing water for heating; and at least a shielded 
electric resistor (13)(54) for heating said water; 

characterized by the fact that it also comprises a liner 
(21)(72) defining said chamber (37)(80); the liner 

(21)(72) being made of substantially inoxidizable 
material; and said electric resistor (13)(54) being 

located outside said liner (21)(72). 
A boiler as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that said hollow body (2)(71) comprises a 

first (3)(48) and second (4)(49) half shell connected to 
each other in sealed manner. 
A boiler as claimed in Claim 2, characterized 
by the fact that said liner (21)(72) is defined by a 

third (22)(73) and fourth (23)(74) half shell connected 
to each other in sealed manner. 
A boiler as claimed in Claim 3, characterized 
by the fact that said third (22)(73) and fourth (23)(74) 

half shells are made of stainless steel. 
A boiler as claimed in any one of the foregoing 
Claims, characterized by the fact that it is a so-called 

"wet" boiler (1) wherein said chamber (37) contains a 
given substantially static quantity of water for 

 
heating. 
A boiler as claimed in any one of the foregoing 
Claims from 1 to 5, characterized by the fact that it is 

a so-called "dry" boiler (47) wherein said chamber (80) 
is a conduit along which the water for heating flows.
