comprises emitting a radiation beam (16), which rotates about an axis (O) that is 

fixed in space; providing on the object at least three radiation detectors 
(A,B,C) not aligned with one another; measuring the times at which the beam 

(16a,16b,16c) intercepts said detectors; determining from said interception times the 
relative roll angle; modulating the beam as a function of the beam angle (W); 

determining from said modulation said beam angle; and determining the 
absolute roll angle as the algebraic sum of the relative roll angle and the 

beam angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for determining the roll orientation of 
moving objects through the determination of a roll angle between a plane 
of the object and a fixed reference plane; and optionally, the deviation of 
the object from its intended trajectory. The invention is preferably 
directed to moving objects that are able to change their trajectory, such as 
a land vehicle, a marine vessel, a drilling vehicle, an airplane, a missile or 
a spacecraft, but it can be applied to objects which are not so able, but as 
to which, for some reason, it is required to receive at any moment data 
concerning the orientation of the object with respect to a reference plane. Certain moving objects, such as projectiles, rockets and the like, roll 
during their flight. In order to guide them in their flight to a given target, 
it is necessary to determine their roll orientation at all times with respect 
to the ground, and this can be done by determining the angle between a 
reference plane which is fixed in space and a line fixed to the moving 
object that is perpendicular to the roll axis. Said angle will be called 
hereinafter "the absolute roll angle". Any axis fixed to the object may be 
designated as the "roll axis" . In flying objects, the longitudinal axis of the 
object is normally chosen as the roll axis. In other moving objects, an axis 
parallel to the intended trajectory is usually chosen as the roll axis.  UK Patent 1,215,869, corresponding to USP 3,614,025, discloses a guiding 
system for providing data for determining the instantaneous distance of a 
moving object from a desired trajectory. The system comprises providing 
a narrow, flat laser-type beam which rotates about an axis parallel to the 
direction of the propagation of the light waves, which axis is also the line 
connecting the beam emitter to the target which the object is intended to 
reach. A plurality of detectors, at least three, are disposed on the object in 
a plane substantially perpendicular to the beam rotation axis, spaced from 
the central axis of the object, four such detectors being exemplified. Each 
time one of the detectors intercepts the beam, it sends a signal. The time 
intervals between successive signals are measured, and from said time 
intervals the deviation of the moving object, viz. the distance of the object 
axis from the intended trajectory, can be determined. USP 4,910,410 discloses a device and a method for determining the roll 
orientation of a moving object, e.g. a missile. In said device and
