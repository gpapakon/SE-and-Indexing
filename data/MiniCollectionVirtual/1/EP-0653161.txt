<ABSTRACT>
An antibacterial mildewproof glaze composition for ceramic products which contains a silver-containing 
substance and a refractory and/or a glass composition. This composition is used to manufacture ceramic products 

which need to be specially sanitary, for example, tiles, sanitary fixtures, toilet stools and bathtubs, and can display their 
antibacterial mildewproof properties effectively. This glaze composition can be used for, especially, washstands, tiles, 

toilet stools and bathtubs in a hospital, a hotel and public facilities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal
glaze composition for ceramic products. More concretely, the present
invention relates to an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal glaze composition for
ceramic products incorporating a silver-containing substance which is
useful in imparting anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties to ceramic
products such as porcelain, enamel products and the like.Products such as commodes, wash bowels and bath tubs, due to
frequent direct contact with the skin of humans or frequent close
encounters with the skin, require sanitary properties, as well as an
appealing external appearance. In order to satisfy these aforementioned
requirements, products such as the aforementioned commode are made
from ceramic products.The reason for the aforementioned is because the surface of the
ceramic products is glaze, i.e., coated using glass, and this glaze layer
which is a fine layer of a glass substance formed from glaze does not
absorb water and, in addition, possesses a smooth surface which is
difficult to damage. Therefore, these ceramic products have sufficiently
satisfied the demands regarding sanitation and an appealing external
appearance.However, recently, the requirements, from a sanitary perspective,
have further increased with respect to tile and sanitary earthenware, in
addition to the aforementioned products. In particular, in hospitals in 
which MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is causing
problems, the requirements from a sanitary perspective have further
increased with respect to ceramic products such as the tile used for floors,
walls of operating rooms, and the like, as well as commodes.However, the conventional glaze does not inherently possess anti-bacterial
and anti-fungal properties and consequently, does not possess the
ability to kill bacterium and fungi adhering to the surfaces of the
aforementioned ceramic products.The present invention provides an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal
glaze composition for ceramic products incorporating a silver-containing
substance; a fire resistant material formed from clay, agalmatolite,
diaspore, bauxite, alumina silicate and the like; and/or an oxide glass
composition such as soda-lime glass, lead glass, borosilicate glass,
alumino-silicate glass and the like. Hence, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal
effects can be generated by means of the silver component in the
aforementioned silver-containing substance such that it is possible to form
an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal glaze layer and enamel
