<ABSTRACT>
A PC strand (1) is formed by twisting peripheral wires (3) 
made of deformed PC steel wires around a core (2), and allowing 

rust inhibitive material of thermoplastic resin to permeate into 
voids defined between the core (1) and peripheral wires (3) by 

use of an extruder. The core (2) may be deformed instead of the 
peripheral wires (3). Since at least one of the core (2) and 

peripheral wires (3) is made of a deformed PC steel wire having 
an uneven outer surface, the thermoplastic resin can smoothly 

permeate deep into the inside of the PC strand.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a PC strand coated with rust
inhibitive material, which is used for stressing
prestressed concrete or as a suspender cable for a
suspension bridge, and a method for producing the coated
PC strand.In recent years, there have been developed a PC strand
applied for a posttension unbond method, which is coated
with sticky synthetic resin and inserted into a synthetic
resin sheath, and another PC strand applied for a
pretension bond method, which is placed within concrete in
use after being coated with synthetic resin and strained.
(Japanese Patent Application Public Disclosure No. HEI
1-215528(A))Such conventional PC strands inevitably embrace small
spaces or voids around a core and peripheral wires in
spite of coating of the synthetic resin. The small spaces
or voids disadvantageously permit water and air to sink
from the end of the strand into the inside of the strand
through the voids, thus to possibly corrode the core and
peripheral wires of the strand.There has been so far proposed a method for solving
such a problem, which comprises previously coating string
wires one by one with synthetic resin, twisting the string
wires to form a strand body, and further coating the
strand body with synthetic resin. (Japanese Patent
Application Public Disclosure No. SHO 61-144121(A))The PC strand produced by the proposed method however
suffers a disadvantage such that residual stress caused by
twisting the string wires remains in the strand because 
the PC strand is not subjected to bluing treatment.
Consequently, the conventional PC strand is apt to untwist and
destabilize its strength. Besides, since the core and
peripheral wires are individually coated with synthetic resin
so as to interpose synthetic resin among the core and wires, the
PC strand resultantly produced is elastically lengthened
particularly when it is forcibly stretched.There has been developed a method for permitting the PC
strand to be free from these disadvantages, in which the PC
strand is coated with rust inhibitive material while being
passed through a pressure head in a synthetic resin extruder
under a high pressure (about 100 kgf/cm2 or more) so as to press
the synthetic resin into the voids among the core and wires of
the strand under pressure. (Japanese Pat. Appln. Public
Disclosures Nos. JP-A-05 089 742 and HEI 5-37331(a)).There are thus known a PC strand and a method having the
features of the preamble of claims 1 and 4.However, this prior art method calls for heavy pressure to
press the molten synthetic resin
