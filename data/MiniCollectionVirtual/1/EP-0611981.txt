<ABSTRACT>
The optical device consists essentially of an anisotropic layer of interlinked liquid-crystalline monomers having locally different orientation of the liquid crystal molecules. An orientation layer of a polymer network (PPN) which can be photo-oriented is in contact with the liquid crystal layer. For producing the optical device, the liquid-crystalline monomers are oriented by means of the interaction with the PPN layer and the orientations are fixed in a subsequent interlinking step.

An optical component comprising an anisotropic 
layer (9) of cross-linked liquid-crystalline monomers 

with locally varying orientation of the liquid crystal 
molecules, characterised by an orientation layer in 

contact with the liquid crystal layer and consisting of 
a photo-orientable polymer network (PPN). 
An optical component according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the orientation layer has an 

orientation of the polymer molecules which differs in 
locally limited regions. 
An optical component according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the direction of the optical axis 

of the anisotropic layer varies according to the 
orientation of the polymer molecules of the orientation 

layer. 
A process for the production of an optical 
component according to claim 1, characterised in that 

the liquid-crystalline monomers are oriented by 
interaction with the PPN layer and the orientations are 

fixed in a subsequent cross-linking step. 
A process according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the cross-linking is effected by irradiation with 

light. 
A process according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the cross-linkable monomers are diacrylates and 

the orientation layer material is cinnamate 
derivatives.  

 
A process according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the cross-linking is effected in a cell consisting 

of two parallel orientation layers. 
A process according to claim 7, characterised in 
that one of the two orientation layers is removed after 

cross-linking. 
A process according to claim 4, characterised in 
that a substrate coated with PPN is selectively 

structured by repeated illumination with linear-polarised 
UV light of varying polarisation direction, 

and then the cross-linkable LC material is oriented and 
cross-linked by spin-coating or immersion processes. 
A process according to any one of claims 4 to 9, 
characterised in that the cross-linkable LC material 

used consists of mixtures of multi-functionalised LC 
monomers and functionalised dichroic chromophores. 
A process according to any one of claims 4 to 9, 
characterised in that the cross-linkable LC material 

used consists of mixtures of multi-functionalised LC 
monomers and chiral molecules. 
A process according to any one of claims 4 to 9, 
characterised in that the cross-linkable LC material 

used comprises mixtures of multi-functionalised LC 
monomers and functionalised LC monomers with an axial 

or lateral permanent dipole moment such that said 
mixtures have a positive or negative dielectric 

anisotropy.

of claims 1 to 3 as an image carrier cell in which the 

image information is stored by cell segments of 
different orientation.

of claims 1 to 3 in a three-dimensional projection 

system.
