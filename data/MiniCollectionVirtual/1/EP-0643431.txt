<ABSTRACT>
The captioned material is composed mainly of carbonaceous particles obtained by crushing pitch carbon fiber. The interplanar 
spacing d of the carbon particle is 0.338 nm or less. The average particle size is 5 to 200 µm. The captioned lithium secondary 

cell uses this negative electrode material. The pitch fiber is burnee at 800 to 2600 °C to prepare the carbon fiber, which is 
then crushed. The crushed carbon fiber thus obtained is again burned at a temperature higher than that of the burning process before 

the crushing, hence manufacturing the carbon fiber particles having the above-mentioned degree of graphitization and average 

size.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carbonaceous
negative electrode materials for a lithium secondary cell
which are prepared by a lithium doping/undoping (dedoping)
reaction, to methods for their production, and to
a lithium secondary cell. More specifically, it relates
to carbonaceous materials, especially particulate
electrode materials.The trend in recent years toward smaller and lighter
electronic devices has strengthened the demand for high-energy
densification of secondary cells. Lithium
secondary cells have been receiving attention as high-energy
densified secondary cells aimed at meeting this
demand, and they have been undergoing rapid development.The main problem faced in the development of these
lithium secondary cells is that the lithium metal used as
the negative electrode undergoes deterioration with
repeated charging and discharging. This is a result of
the state of the lithium metal as it is deposited on the
negative electrode during charging; for example the
dendrite, which is a dendritic crystal, causes
delamination from the negative electrode plate or short-circuiting
with the opposing electrode.In order to overcome these problems, a variety of
different negative electrode materials comprising lithium
alloys and doped/undoped lithium have been proposed and
tested.However, problems remain with lithium alloys, in
that deep charging and discharging is difficult, they are
not suitable for charging and discharging with a high
current density, etc. On the other hand, carbon 
materials and electrically conductive polymers have also
been proposed as lithium doping materials, but remaining
problems with such electrically conductive polymers
include that they have low doping ratios, and that they
are chemically and electrically unstable with lithium.
At present, most attention is being directed to carbon
materials as lithium metal substitutes for the negative
electrodes of lithium secondary cells.When a carbon material is used as the negative
electrode of a lithium secondary cell, lithium is
intercalated between layers of the carbon material in the
electrolyte solution during charging, to form what is
known as a graphite intercalation compound. Also, during
discharge the interlayer lithium is discharged into the
electrolyte solution. Thus, in principle, the use of a
carbon material makes it possible to eliminate the
deterioration of the negative electrode which accompanies
the charge/discharge cycle of the dendrite, etc. that
occurs when lithium metal is used as the negative
electrode.Such carbon
