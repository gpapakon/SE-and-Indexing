<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printing head (14) is mounted on a movable carriage 
(13) and a fixing device (32) removably fixes the head (14) by means of 

a hook (111) adapted to cooperate with a shoulder of the head (14) or 
an alternative printing head (16) of the wire type. An electronic control 

unit (22) controls a control device (156) adapted to recognise which type 
of head is mounted on the carriage (13) and actuates it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printer with interchangeable printing
heads, comprising a carriage for supporting an ink jet printing head and
moving it along a print line, a fixing device for removably fixing the ink
jet head or an alternative printing head to the carriage and a control
device for controlling the ink jet head and the alternative printing head.A printer of this type is known, in which the ink jet head is
monochrome and the alternative head is also an ink et head, but can
print several colours and can be mounted as an alternative to the
monochrome head on the carriage of the printer. The control device is
adapted to recognise the type of head mounted and to control it both in
the case of the monochrome head and in the case of the head printing
several colours.A printer with two ink jet printing heads, one of the
monochrome type and another of the multicolour type, is also known, the
two heads being mounted together on the carriage and being controlled
and actuated by one single control device.A wire printer is also known, on which one printing head of a
series of printing heads, respectively of the type having 9, 18 or 24
wires, can be mounted. For the relevant control, a specialised control
device for the head having 9, 18 or 24 wires must be mounted actually
on the printer.The printers of the prior art use alternative printing heads which
are different with respect to several features, such as the colour of the
ink and/or the number of dots of the printing matrix, but which use the
same technology. These printers therefore have the advantages and the 
disadvantages associated with the technology of the heads that can be used. E.g.
ink jet printers, although displaying optimum print quality, involve relatively high
overall costs for the head and ink and therefore for each character printed. It is
moreover impossible to produce "carbon" copies, as required in banking. Printers
with wire heads for their part have low printing costs and allow for the compilation
of multiple copies, but offer a relatively mediocre print quality.A possible solution to the abovementioned problem is known from
WO 90/08040 published on July 26th, 1990, in which a printer is disclosed which
permits switching between a matrix wire printing head and an ink jet printing head
having the same number of wires and ink jets respectively, each in an arrangement
identical to the impression point pattern to be produced. The ink jet head is
associated with an adapter circuit which generates suitable voltage pulses for the
ink

<CLAIMS>
A printer for printing documents, comprising:

interchangeable printing heads;
a carriage (13) for interchangeably holding alternately an ink jet
printing head (14) or a wire printing head (16), and moving it in a forward direction

and in a backward direction along a print line (34,36);
sensing means (156) for sensing the presence on said carriage (13)
of said ink jet printing head and of said alternative wire printing head; and
a control device (22), responsive to said sensing means, for
controlling the operation of said ink jet printing head (14) and said alternative wire

printing head (16);

characterised in that it further comprises an intermediate frame (76)
supporting said wire printing head and a removable cartridge (77) for an ink ribbon

(78) operatively associated with said wire printing head, and a fixing device (32) for
removably fixing said ink jet printing head or said frame supporting said wire printing

head to said carriage, whereby the removal of said wire print head from said
carriage leads to the simultaneous removal of said ink ribbon cartridge (77).
A printer according to claim 1, further comprising a ribbon feeding
mechanism (81) for feeding said ink ribbon (78) in a feeding direction having an idle

configuration and a working configuration, said ribbon feeding mechanism assuming
said working configuration when said intermediate frame (76) supporting said wire

printing head (16) is fixed to said carriage (13).
A printer according to claim 2, in which said ink ribbon feeding
mechanism comprises a rack (84), and a kinematic unit (86) adapted to assume a

working position in engagement with said rack; said frame supporting said wire
printing head (16), and said removable ribbon cartridge comprising a projecting

extension (97) adapted to cooperate with part of said kinematic unit to position it in
said working position, said kinematic unit (86) assuming said working position when

said ink ribbon feeding mechanism (81) assumes said working configuration and
said intermediate frame (76) is fixed to said carriage (13). 
A printer according to claim 3, in which said kinematic unit (86)
comprises a first gear and a second gear selectively engageable with a series of

toothed wheels (98,101) engaged with one another, and a shaft (88) actuated by
one of said wheels and adapted to be coupled to a drive element for feeding said

ink ribbon of said cartridge in said feeding direction, in which when said kinematic
unit (86) assumes said working position said first gear and said second gear

engage with said rack (82), said first gear engaging with said series of toothed
wheels when said carriage (13) moves in said forward direction and said second

gear engaging with said series of toothed wheels when said carriage moves in said
backward direction, whereby said ribbon feeding mechanism (81) always feeds said

ink ribbon in said feeding direction.
A printer according to any preceding claim, in which said ink jet head
(14) and said intermediate frame (76) each have a shoulder (117,118), and said

fixing device (32) comprises a hook (111) engageable with said shoulder and
movable between a first and a second position, a lever (113) hinged on to said

carriage (13) and connected to said hook, and a spring (116) adapted to hold said
hook (111) in said first position in which said hook engages with said shoulder and

said hook, in said first position, locks said ink jet head (14) or said frame on said
carriage and, in said second position, allows it to be removed.
Printer according claim 1, characterised in that said ink jet printing
head (14) has a first plural
ity of emission resistors and associated ink ejection
nozzles and said wire printing head (16) has a second plurality of printing needles,

said first plurality being different from said second plurality; and in that said control
device (22) comprises activatable first driving means (161) for driving said emission

resistors and associated ink ejection nozzles, and second driving means (162) for
driving said printing needles, said first driving means being activated for supplying

pulses of low current intensity to said ink jet printing head when said sensing means
sense the presence on said carriage of said ink jet printing head, and said second

driving means being activated for supplying pulses of medium current intensity to
said wire printing head when said sensing means sense the presence on said

carriage of said wire printing head. 
A printer according to claim 6, in which said ink jet printing head (14)
and said wire printing head (16) comprise respectively first and second electrical

connection means for electrically connecting to said control device (22), said first
and second connection means comprising a series of conductive areas (144,146)

respectively arranged on a first (142) and a second platform (143); and said control
device comprises third electrical connection means for electrically connecting to

said ink jet printing head and said wire printing head, said third connection means
comprising a third platform (133) mounted on said carriage (13) and having

respective conductive areas, said first and second platforms being superimposable
selectively by said third platform in order to establish an electrical connection

between said ink jet printing head (14) or alternately said wire printing head (16)
mounted on said carriage and said control device, said sensing means being

conditioned by reciprocal conductive states of said conductive areas of said third
platform, and at least two of said conductive areas of said second platform being

electrically interconnected.
