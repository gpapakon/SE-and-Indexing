1. The use of an epoxidation reagent comprising hydrogen 
peroxide and at least one aryl methyl ketone of the 

general formula I 

 
wherein
 
X represents a fluorine or chlorine atom,
 
R¹ , R² and R³, which may be the same or different, each 

represents a C₁-C₆-alkyl, C₆-C₁₀-aryl, C₆-C₁₀-Ar-C₁-C₆-alkyl, 
0-C₁-C₆-alkyl or 0-C₆-C₁₀-aryl radical, a fluorine, 

chlorine, bromine or hydrogen atom, a cyano, nitro 
or trifluoromethyl group, an amide radical -CO-NR⁴R⁵ or a 

sulphonyl radical -SO₂R⁴, wherein R⁴ and R⁵ are the same 
or different and each represents a C₁-C₆-alkyl, C₁-C₁₀-aryl 

or C₆-C₁₀-aryl-C₁-C₆-alkyl group, it being possible 
in the case of -CO-NR⁴R⁵ for R⁴ and R⁵ together to form 

an aliphatic or aromatic five- or six-membered heterocycle, 
or R¹ and R² together represent a fused aliphatic 

or aromatic ring, for the preparation of epoxidised 
steroids. 
2. Process for the preparation of steroids having a 
9(11)-double bond and a 5α(10α)-epoxy group, characterised 

in that a steroid having two double bonds in the 
5(10)- and 9(11)-positions is substantially stereo-specifically 

epoxidised with an epoxidation reagent 
comprising hydrogen peroxide and at least one aryl 

methyl ketone of the general formula I  
 


 
wherein
 
X represents a fluorine or chlorine atom,
 
R¹ , R² and R³, which may be the same or different, each 

represents a C₁-C₆-alkyl, C₆-C₁₀-aryl, C₆-C₁₀-Ar-C₁-C₆-alkyl, 
0-C₁-C₆-alkyl or 0-C₆-C₁₀-aryl radical, a fluorine, 

chlorine, bromine or hydrogen atom, a cyano, nitro 
or trifluoromethyl group, an amide radical -CO-NR⁴R⁵ or a 

sulphonyl radical -SO₂R⁴, wherein R⁴ and R⁵ are the same 
or different and each represents a C₁-C₆-alkyl, C₁-C₁₀-aryl 

or C₆-C₁₀-aryl-C₁-C₆-alkyl group, it being possible 
in the case of -CO-NR⁴R⁵ for R⁴ and R⁵ together to form 

an aliphatic or aromatic five- or six-membered heterocycle, 
or R¹ and R² together represent a fused aliphatic 

or aromatic ring. 
3. Process according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the epoxidation is carried out at a temperature of from 

-5 to +60°C, preferably from +10 to +40°C. 
4. Process according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the epoxidation is carried out in organic solvents 

such as dioxan, diglyme, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxy-ethane, 
or in chlorinated organic solvents with the 

addition of a tertiary amine, preferably in dichloromethane, 
chloroform or ethylene chloride with the 

addition of pyridine or lutidine.
