<ABSTRACT>
A sampling point (110) for use in a pollution/smoke detection system for fixture to an apertured panel in a building, this system including a plurality of said sampling points (110) for connection to an aspirated gas reticulation system for drawing gas from said sampling points (110) exposed to a space under surveillance, said sampling point including a portion (19) for securement to a retaining means (10) and a capillary tube (15a) communicating between the sampling point (110) and said aspirated gas reticulation system, the sampling point (110) having an orifice (116) of a predetermined size to communicate between an area to be surveyed and the gas reticulation system, said capillary tube (116) conforming to standard smoke detection requirements as to bore strength flexibility and crush resistance, said sampling point (110) being adapted to be fitted from either the visible or blind side of the apertured panel and including collapsible shroud means (17, 18) capable of passing through said apertured panel and expanding to hide the panel aperture from which it has emerged. A cover (117) releasably fitted to an apertured mounting base (111) and a capillary tube (113) for communicating the mounting base (111) and the gas reticulation system through an aperture, wherein the mounting base (111) and the cover (117) interconnect with a press fit, said cover (117) comprising an aesthetically formed shroud for the sampling point (110), is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GAS SAMPLING POINT FOR SMOKE/POLLUTION DETECTION SYSTEMSThe present invention relates to a sampling point for use in pollution and smoke detection systems and specifically very early warning smoke detection apparatus.Sampling points are used to penetrate a wall or ceiling and in operation are coupled to a capillary tube which is in turn connected to a pipe system distributed throughout a building or the like for drawing gas samples from the various sampling points to a pollution detection system. It is important that the sampling points for smoke detectors are strategically positioned to ensure collection of smoke at the earliest possible moment. It is therefore possible or usual for the sample point to be located in conspicuous positions in the room of a building, necessitating good aesthetic appearance of the sampling point. Furthermore it is important that the fitting of such sampling points is a relatively simple operation and yet the device must comply with various standards, for example Australian Standard 1670 which amongst other things calls for penetration of the sampling point for at least 25 mm into the space to be surveyed and the provision of a 50 mm identification ring in the case of use in smoke detection apparatus. It is an objective of the present invention to provide an improved sampling point construction complying with standard requirements has a minimum number of parts, and is simple to manufacture and install.This application is an extended disclosure of that contained in co-pending Application No. PL 2454 filed on the 14th May, 1992 which is hereby incoÏ†orated herein by cross-reference.There is provided according to the present invention a sample point for use in a pollution/smoke detection system for fixture to an apertured panel in a building, this system including a plurality of said sampling points for connection to an aspirated gas reticulation system for drawing gas from said sampling points exposed to a space under surveillance, said sample point including a portion for securement to a retaining means and a capillary tube communicating between the sampling point and said aspirated gas reticulation system, the 

sampling point having an orifice of predetermined size to communicate between an area to be surveyed and the gas reticulation system, said capillary tube conforming to standard smoke detection requirements as the bore strength flexibility and crush resistance, said sampling point being adapted to be fitted from either the visible or blind side of the apertured panel

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVFNTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. A sampling point for use in a pollution/smoke detection system for fixture to an apertured panel in a building, this system including a plurality of said sampling points for connection to an aspirated gas reticulation system for drawing gas from said sampling points exposed to a space under surveillance, said sampling point including a portion for securement to a retaining means and a capillary tube communicating between the sampling point and said aspirated gas reticulation system, the sampling point having an orifice of a predetermined size to communicate between an area to be surveyed and the gas reticulation system, said capillary tube conforming to standard smoke detection requirements as to bore strength flexibility and crush resistance, said sampling point being adapted to be fitted from either the visible or blind side of the apertured panel and including collapsible shroud means capable of passing through said apertured panel and expanding to hide the panel aperture from which it has emerged.
2. A sampling point adapted to be fixed to an apertured panel or the like in a building for use in a pollution/smoke detection system in the building, the system including a plurality of sampling points for connection to an aspirated gas reticulation system for drawing gas from said sampling point exposed to a space under surveillance, said sampling point including a retention member for securing a capillary tube to communicate between the sampling point and said reticulation system, the arrangement being such that the capillary tube can be fitted from either the visible or blind side of the apertured panel or the like wherein the sampling point includes collapsible shroud means adapted to pass through said apertured panel or the like for fitment of the sampling point from the blind side of the aperture, said shroud means being expandable upon passing through the aperture to form a cover for the aperture.
3. A sampling point for use in a pollution/smoke detection system comprising a two part construction including an apertured mounting base for 


fixture to a base surface such as a ceiling for connection to an aspirated gas reticulation system for drawing gas from a plurality of sampling points and a cover releasably fitted to said mounting base and a capillary tube including an aperture for communicating with said aperture mounting base and a gas reticulation system wherein the mounting base and the cover interconnect with a press fit, said cover comprising an aesthetically formed shroud for the sampling point.
4. A sampling point as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said collapsible shroud means is collapsible in one direction only to enable it to support or absorb actual loads applied thereto in the opposing direction.
5. A sampling point as claimed in claim 4 wherein the collapsible shroud means includes a part releasably secured to said retaining portion on said sampling point and hinged radially extending members thereon adapted to retract when passing through the panel aperture and to expand radially to form said shroud in the manner of an unfolding umbrella.
6. A sampling point as claimed in claim 1 wherein the retaining portion is threaded and split longitudinally to provide clamping means for rapid and secure fixing of the capillary tube, said clamping means being engaged by encircling the threaded portion of the sampling point with the shroud member which forces the clamping means to squeeze into the capillary tube.
7. A sampling point as claimed in claim 6 wherein the retaining member and the shroud members include partial thread portions which allow ratcheting of the components over the threaded portion but allow adequate tightening of the components when screwed together to provide a secure fitting.
