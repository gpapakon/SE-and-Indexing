<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for recording digital information comprises 
recording data generator (16, 36, 39, 42) for producing recording 

digital information data containing at least one of digital video 
information data accompanied with first attendant data added thereto 

and digital audio information data accompanied with second attendant 
data added thereto, a recording portion (45, 47, 48) operative to 

record the recording digital information data on a record medium, and 
a controller operable to set selectively a plurality of recording modes 

for the recording of the recording digital information data on the 
record medium carried out by the recording portion. The first and 

second attendant data contain recording mode data having a code 
selected to correspond to the recording mode set by the controller. An 

apparatus for reproducing digital information is operative to reproduce 
the recording digital information data from the record medium and 

process there produced recording digital information data, in response 
to reproduced first and second attendant data, to reproduce video and 

audio signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus for
recording and/or reproducing digital information.It is known to use a video tape recorder (VTR) to record video
and audio signals constituting a television broadcast signal on a
magnetic tape and/or to reproduce video and audio signals from a
magnetic tape on which the video and audio signals are recorded. It has
also been proposed to adopt a digital recording system; this can give
various advantages such as an improvement in the quality of pictures
and sound obtained based on video and audio signals reproduced from a
magnetic tape, the possibility of high density recording of video and
audio signals on a magnetic tape, and the ability to record diverse
information on a magnetic tape together with video and audio signals.
A VTR to which the digital recording system is applied is commonly
called a digital VTR. In such a digital VTR, video and audio signals
constituting a television broadcast signal are digitized to produce
digital video and audio information data, respectively, and then
recording digital information data which contain the digital video and
audio information data are formed, to be recorded on a magnetic tape.When the recording digital information data containing the
digital video and audio information data are recorded on the magnetic
tape in the digital VTR, the magnetic tape is scanned by a rotary
magnetic head to which the recording digital information data are
supplied. A plurality of record tracks extending in parallel with one
another are successively formed on the magnetic tape by each scanning
of the rotary magnetic head so as to incline to the direction along
which the magnetic tape extends, in the same manner as the recording in
an ordinary VTR. For the recording in the digital VTR, several "data
distribution manners" can be considered for distributing the recording
digital information data to each record track formed on the magnetic
tape. It has been proposed as one of such data distributing manners to
record one unit section of the recording digital information data,
which contains a digital video information data section corresponding
to one frame period of the video signal (hereinafter referred to as
digital video information data frame section) and a digital audio
information data section corresponding to the digital video information 
data frame section, on a record track group consisting of ten record
tracks arranged to be adjacent successively to each other on a magnetic
tape.Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings
