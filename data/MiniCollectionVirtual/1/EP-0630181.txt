<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nutritional product for persons subjected
to trauma or surgery.Trauma is a leading health problem in the United States today. Trauma is
the number one killer of young adults and it ranks third overall, following heart
disease and cancer. For every American who dies as a result of trauma, there
are three Americans permanently disabled (500,000 permanent disabilities/year).Approximately 50% of deaths from trauma occur within seconds of the injury.
Trauma prevention is the only way to alter deaths which occur immediately
following injury. A second peak in deaths occurs within two or three hours after
the trauma and is dependent upon available intervention and treatment of the
life-threatening aspects of the injury. The third peak occurs days or even weeks
following the injury and is usually caused by sepsis and/or multiple organ
failure. Sepsis may be defined as the presence of bacterial infection.
Septicemia continues to be a problem in the critically ill, surgical or
traumatized patient. Death secondary to systemic sepsis is not uncommon and may
occur two to four weeks after the initial injury.Severe injury or trauma, including surgery, is associated with loss of the
body's nutrient stores due both to the injury itself and the resulting catabolic
state. For optimal recovery, critically ill patients need proper nutritional
intake. Lack of it can result in malnutrition-associated complications,
including prolonged negative nitrogen balance, depletion of somatic and visceral
protein levels, immune incompetence, increased risk of infection, and other
complications associated with morbidity and mortality. A primary objective of
nutritional support for the traumatized person is to replace or maintain the
body's normal level of nutrients by providing adequate energy substrates,
protein, and other nutrients essential for tissue repair and recovery.While nutrients may be provided by either parenteral or enteral routes,
clinicians are making greater efforts to use the enteral route in light of
research showing that enteral feeding confers certain physiologic benefits not
seen with parenteral feeding. Published studies have reported that early enteral
feeding provides energy and nutrients essential for optimal healing and
immunocompetence, helps maintain the gut mucosal integrity, and may blunt
catabolic effects and normalize blood glucose levels. Certain nutrients have
effects on the gastrointestinal tract and immune system that go beyond the
provision of nutrition. For example,
