Headbox system for a paper machine, comprising at least one central
distributor (10) for distributing a stock suspension uniformly, having an

integrated damping system; a modularly constructed forming unit (30)
which arranges a plurality of adjacent rows beside one another, each

row comprising at least one line connection module (1), one nozzle
module (5) and at least one intermediate module (2; 3; 4) which is

symmetrical in relation to at least one plane in the machine direction, the
modules having flange elements which fit together; and a plurality of

connecting lines (20) between distributor (10) and forming unit (30),
characterized in that each row is connected to the at least one central

distributor (10) via a plurality of connecting lines (20).
Headbox system according to Claim 1, characterized in that at least two
central distributors (10) are provided.
Headbox system according to Claim 2, characterized in that in each row
of the forming unit (30), the number of line connection modules (1)

corresponds to an integer multiple of the number of distributors (10).
Headbox system according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that each
row is assigned at least one mixing device for mixing two liquids, having

a first feed line for a first volume part flow, a second feed line for a
second volume part flow and a discharge line for the mixture volume

flow, having a flow resistance, a mixing angle between the first feed line
and the second feed line being selected such that the mixture volume

flow remains constant irrespective of the second volume part flow.
Headbox system according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the forming unit (30) comprises at least two rows stacked one

above another.
Headbox system according to Claim 5, characterized in that the rows
located one above another are assigned to a single and joint nozzle

module (5). 
Headbox system according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that
all the lines (20) between forming unit (30) and the at least one central

distributor (10) are assigned regulating devices for influencing the flow
throughput.
Headbox system according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
the intermediate module (2, 3, 4) is designed or combined from the

group of modules comprising formation modules, turbulence modules,
diffuser modules, rectifier modules and perforated-roll modules.
Headbox system according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that
the connecting lines (20) are designed to be flexible.
Headbox system according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that
the forming unit (30) comprises four adjacent rows.
