<ABSTRACT>
A process for regioselectively producing a lignan compound of general formula (I) by reacting a lactone 
compound of general formula (II) with a compound of the formula: R⁷Cl (R⁷ being a tri(lower alkyl)silyl group) 

in the presence of a base, effecting the addition reaction of an acetylene compound of general formula (III) with 
the resultant compound, and reducing the product. In said formulas R¹ represents alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyl-lower 

alkyl, aralkyl, etc.: R² and R³ each represent lower alkoxy, etc.; R⁴ represents lower alkoxy or hydrogen; and R⁵ and 
R⁶ each represent lower alkyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method
of preparing compounds of lignan series. More
particularly, it relates to a method of preparing
compounds of lignan series having an aryl ketone chain
or alkyl ketone chain and to a method of preparing
said compounds of lignan series utilizing Diels-Alder
reaction.The compounds of lignan series are useful for
treating arteriosclerosis, particularly
atherosclerosis, and various compounds were disclosed
and claimed already by the present inventors (Japanese
Patent Publication (Kokai) 5-310634, and WO 93/08155).In Tetrahedron letters, v.10, n.44 (1978) there
is described processes for the preparation of
polysubstituted naphtalenes from phthalide orthoesters
and dienophiles. One of the problems associated with
the process of this document is its application to
large scale synthesis. It is an object of the present
invention to provide a process suitable for large
scale synthesis of compounds of the lignan series.The present invention relates to a process for
preparing a compound represented by the formula (I)
 
in which R1 is an optionally-substituted aryl;
   each of R2 and R3 is an alkoxy group, the oxygen
being substituted with a C1 to C6 alkyl group or R2 and
R3 are combined 
together to form an alkylenedioxy;
   R4 is an alkoxy group, the oxygen being
substituted with a C1 to C6 alkyl group or hydrogen;
and
   each of R5 and R6 is a linear or branched C1 to C6
alkyl;
   which process is characterized by that a lactone
compound represented by the formula (II)

in which R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 are as defined above, is
allowed to react with a compound of the formula: R7Cl,
wherein R7 is tri(lower alkyl)silyl, in the presence
of a base, and then the resulting compound is
subjected to addition reaction with an acetylenic
compound of the formula (III)

in which R1 is as defined above, to give a compound
represented by the formula (IV) 

in which R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are as defined above, which
is then reduced.In the present invention, it is particularly preferred
when R1 is phenyl which is optionally substituted with halogen,
trihalomethyl, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl because the aimed
compound can be prepared with good regioselectivity. For example,
the reaction is expressed by the following scheme (See Example 1
hereinafter). 

In the above-mentioned reaction formulae, two types of products
will be produced in the addition reaction. The selectivity for the
aimed compound given in the reaction formulae versus the side
product which is a positional
