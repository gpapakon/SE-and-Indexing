<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in 
the alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the presence of 
a hydrogen fluoride catalyst. Acid catalyzed alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons 
with olefinic hydrocarbons is a well-known process for the 
preparation of high octane gasoline products. Alkylation of 
hydrocarbons is industrially accomplished in the liquid 
phase by mixing paraffins and olefins in the presence of a 
strong acid catalyst and stirring the mixture until the 
alkylation reaction was completed. To date the usually employed acid catalysts for 
industrial alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons are concentrated 
sulphuric acid or anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, the 
strength of which may be increased by addition of a Lewis 
acid, such as BF3 or SbF5. Those batch processes require large reaction volumes 
and thoroughly mixing of the alkylation mixture by 
mechanical mixing means in order to provide intimate contact 
between the acid catalyst, the reacting hydrocarbons 
and the olefinic alkylating agent. Although being very efficient, a major drawback of 
the known alkylation processes are the environmental and 
health risk involved during handling of large amounts of 
the above acids, as necessary in the processes. Besides being hazardous materials, sulphuric acid 
and hydrofluoric acid are aggressive compounds under the 
reaction conditions used in the alkylation processes. At 
ambient conditions hydrofluoric acid is a volatile gas, 
which necessitates the alkylation process to be carried out 
at low temperatures or at elevated pressure. Increasing concerns about the safety of HF-alkylation 
have caused some improvements in the alkylation processes 
using this acid including modifications using additives 
and changes in reactor design (WO 93/00315, WO 
93/00316, US 5,196,627, US 5,196,628, US 5,196,629, US 
5,114,675 and US 4,938,935). Though those measures lower  
 
the vapour pressure and thus lowers the risk slightly, they 
do not solve the problem involved in handling large quantities 
of liquid volatile hydrogen fluoride, which in case 
of an accident can escape to the environment. It has been found that the vapour pressure, and 
thus environmental or health risk is reduced when using 
hydrogen fluoride during alkylation of hydrocarbons 
adsorbed on a solid material arranged in a suitable 
alkylation reactor without diminishing the acidity and the 
catalytic strength of the acid. Thus, US 2,820,835 discloses a solid catalyst for 
use in the alkylation of hydrocarbons having hydrogen
