<ABSTRACT>
A rectangular cloth fixing frame for use in painting or 
embroidery is provided. The frame is provided with a surface 

projection near the outer periphery of the front surface 
thereof and a fixing means fitting groove on the outer 

peripheral end surface thereof. A cloth such as a canvas of 
a desired size is spread over the frame, a plurality of 

fixing means are driven into the fixing means fitting groove 
through the canvas to thereby fix the canvas to the frame 

under tension. The cloth fixing frame of the present invention 
has various advantages. That is, the fixing means can 

be fixed to the frame in a simple manner and since the fixing 
means are arranged in a straight line along the fixing means 

fitting groove, the external appearance of the frame looks 
fine. Further, due to the presence of the surface projection, 

the flatness of the canvas can be secured and it is possible 
to reduce the thickness of the frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cloth fixing frame 
which is used for painting, embroidery, wall decoration and 
the like. As a cloth fixing frame of this type, there has been 
a canvas fixing frame to be used for oil paining. This 
canvas fixing frame has been made in such a manner that as 
shown in Figs. 42 and 44, a frame 70 is formed by combining a 
plurality of wooden frame-pieces, a cloth 72 such as a hemp 
cloth is placed on the front surface of the frame 70 and after 
fixing together the frame-pieces by driving nails 73 into the 
outer periphery of the frame, the cloth is fixed to the frame. 
By the way, reference numeral 74 designates a tilted portion 
of the front surface of the frame and reference numeral 75 
designates a surface projection forming the edge of the frame. However, although, with the recent trend of thinning the 
picture frame in general, it has been demanded to likewise 
thin the canvas frame, there has been a problem that when the 
canvas frame is made of wooden material, it is liable to crack 
easily. Further, as shown in Fig. 44, it is not easy to drive 
the nails 73 in a straight line but if they are not driven  
 
so, they look unsightly. Moreover, when the frame-pieces 
made thin, some of the nails 73 tend to lie close to the front 
side of the frame so that the peripheral portion of the cloth 
72 tends to become buldged and the flatness of the cloth 72 
is hardly maintained. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a cloth fixing frame capable of securing the flatness 
of the cloth and reducing the thickness thereof. The cloth fixing frame according to the present invention 
includes a surface projection extending along the outer periphery 
of the front surface of the frame and a fixing means 
fitting grrove formed along the outer peripheral end surface 
of the frame. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
a cloth such as a canvas can be fixed with ease in such a 
manner that the cloth is placed on the front surface of the 
frame, the fixing means are pierced into the cloth at the 
fixing means fitting groove along the outer peripheral end 
surface of the frame. Further, as the fixing means which are 
large in number are arranged in a straight line along the 
fixing means fitting groove, it is possible to prevent the 
loth from becoming bulged due to the position of the fixing 
means such as nails driven into the outer end face of the 
frame so that the flatness of the cloth can be secured and  
 
the cloth fixing frame can be

<CLAIMS>
A cloth fixing frame including a surface projection at a 
portion near the outer periphery of the front surface thereof 

and a fixing means fitting groove extending along the outer 
peripheral end surface thereof. 
A cloth fixing frame comprising a plurality of extrusion-molded 
frame-pieces, a plurality of corner members for 

coupling the frame-pieces to provide a frame and a plurality 
of fixing means for fixing a cloth to the frame under tension, 

   wherein each of said frame-pieces is provided with a 
groove extending on and along the outer peripheral end surface 

thereof, a cloth fixing projection a long the front side of the 
groove and at least a hollow portion into which one end of 

each of the corner members is fitted, and 
   wherein each of said fixing means is provided with a leg 

capable of being driven into the groove through the cloth and 
a head for pressing the cloth against the outer peripheral 

end surface of each of the frame-pieces so as to allow the 
cloth to get tensed. 
A cloth fixing frame according to Claim 2, wherein the 
opposing inner wall surfaces of said groove are corrugated so 

that the leg of each of said fixing means comes into frictional 
contact with the corrugated inner wall surfaces. 
A cloth fixing frame according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein 
each of said frame-pieces has two hollow portions arranged 

 
parallelly in the direction of width thereof and is provided 

in the side surface thereof with a plurality of through-holes 
near both ends thereof so as to communicate with the hollow 

portions, 
   wherein a plurality of corner members are provided to 

correspond to said hollow portions and each of said corner 
means is provided with screw-holes in alignment with the 

through-holes of said hollow portions, respectively, and 
   wherein each of said corner members is pressed against 

the front end portion of each said hollow portion by means of 
a bridging screw which is fitted into each of said screw-holes 

through said through-hole with the top end of said bridging 
screw abutting against the inner wall surface of each said 

hollow portion. 
A cloth fixing frame according to Claim 2 or 3, 
wherein either the inner wall surface of the hollow portion 

of each of the frame-pieces or the outer surface of said 
corner members is provided with a crushable portion so that 

when said corner means is press-fitted into said hollow 
portion, the crushable portion is crushed. 
A cloth fixing frame according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein 
each of the frame-pieces has a fitting groove on the inner 

side surface thereof so that at least a reinforcing crosspiece 
is interposed between each of the opposing pairs of the frame-pieces 

with both ends of the reinforcing crosspiece engaging 
 

the fitting grooves of each of the opposing pairs of the 
frame-pieces, respectively. 
A cloth fixing frame according to Claim 2 or 3, wherein 
each of said frame-pieces is provided on the rear surface
