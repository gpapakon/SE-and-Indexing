<ABSTRACT>
A laser processing apparatus for processing a 
workpiece through irradiation with a laser beam has an 

intervening member (9) including a resin material and transmitting 
the laser beam in a laser beam passage space 

between a concentrating lens (4) for condensing the laser 
beam and the workpiece. As a result, the frequency of 

maintenance, operation hours, and running costs can be 
reduced while the processing reliability is greatly improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser processing 
apparatus and, more particularly, to a laser machining 
apparatus equipped with a laser irradiation apparatus for 
irradiating a workpiece with a laser beam. Laser beam machining apparatuses, which machine a 
workpiece by means of a laser beam, are used for a variety 
of applications such as cutting, welding, drilling, 
marking, and surface reforming. This type of laser beam machining apparatus has 
various optical systems between a laser oscillator and a 
workpiece to concentrate a laser beam emitted from the 
laser oscillator into a suitable beam diameter for an 
intended purpose. The optical systems are provided at 
their end with a concentrating lens for condensing the 
laser beam onto the workpiece, thus causing the laser beam 
to have suitable energy density for the intended purpose. In the meantime, laser machining causes fusion and 
evaporation of a workpiece material due to irradiation 
with a high-energy-density laser beam, leading to a 
phenomenon in which fused particles of the workpiece 
material or of compounds including elements the workpiece 
material are scattered at high speed. Part of the 
scattered particles, generally referred to as spatters,  
 
reach the concentrating lens, and may adhere to its 
surface or stain or damage it. Accordingly, there arises 
a need of frequent cleaning or replacement of the 
concentrating lens, and these additional operations, 
coupled with an optical axis alignment operation, cause 
the problems of suspension of production and an increase 
in production costs. Since the stain and damage on the concentrating lens 
cause a variation in the laser output in a short time, 
they raise a problem in the machining reliability. As the solutions to these problems, there have 
conventionally been proposed a method in which spatters 
are blown off by an air blow provided between the 
concentrating lens and the workpiece (as disclosed in 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Sho. 59-223191), 
and a method which prevents the concentrating 
lens from being stained or damaged by interposing a light 
transmissive aperture between the concentrating lens and 
the workpiece (as disclosed, for example, in Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei. 5-38594). It is 
also conceivable to combine these two methods. Although the first method of using the air blow can 
somewhat reduce the frequency of replacing the concentrating 
lens, there still remains the apprehension that 
part of spatters may not be blown off
