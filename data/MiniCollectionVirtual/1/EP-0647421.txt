<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a carrier (1) for carrying an infant (13), which comprises a horizontal platform (2) and a carrying strap (5). The carrier (1) is characterised in that the horizontal platform (2) is rigid and extends essentially plane in its longitudinal direction, in that the carrying strap (5) is designed in one piece and can be placed, in a manner fastened on the top end (3) and bottom end (4) of the horizontal platform (2), about the upper part of the body of an individual (6), the carrying strap (5) extending at least in the region of the top end (3) of the horizontal platform (2) over the full width of the end face (7) and having external sections (8, 9) there having an adjustable length such that the horizontal platform (2) is located essentially in a horizontal position transversely to its longitudinal direction. Due to its special design the carrier (1) according to the invention permits carrying of the infant (13) in an advantageous outstretched position which is not too narrow and, if appropriate, even in an upright position. Since the infant (13) in the carrier (1) according to the invention is carried in front of the body it is always possible, moreover, to attend to the infant (in connection with Figure 1).
