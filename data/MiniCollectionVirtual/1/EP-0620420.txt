<ABSTRACT>
In a method for measuring the flow of an electrolytic fluid, 
the voltage or current is measured between two stationary 

electrodes immersed in the electrolyte. A device for measuring 
the flow comprises at least two electrodes (16, 18) intended 

for immersion in the electrolyte. The electrodes are 
stationary, and a measurement unit (26) is arranged to measure 

the voltage or current between the electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and a device for measuring
the flow of an electrolytic fluid, at least two electrodes then
being immersed in the electrolyte.This type of flow measurement has a number of industrial and
medical applications, such as the measurement of blood flow for
rate-responsive control of a pacemaker and in conjunction with
the detection of tachycardia. Blood flow is reduced in
tachycardia.This type of flow measurement has previously been performed
by e.g. thermodilution, the cooling of a heated electrode by
fluid flowing around it then being studied. The electrode can
be heated and the temperature in the medium can be e.g.
alternately sensed. Performing such flow measurements with the
aid of Doppler sound measurement is also previously known. Both
these prior art methods require relatively complex equipment.The document EP-A-0 077 413 discloses a system for measuring the flow rate of
electrolytic fluids including a flow cell with a cylindrical channel for the fluid flow and a
pair of spaced apart electrodes conformed to the cylindrical surface of the flow channel.
The electrodes are electrically conductive and inert to the fluid and are in contact with
the fluid flow for a desired range of flow measurement. A monopolar pulse train is
applied across the electrodes to effect a cell impedance which is inversely proportional
to the rate of flow. A control signal is produced in response to the potential across the
electrodes and this signal is applied to the pulse train generator varying the pulse train
current to effect an increase in the current in response to an increase in flow rate
whereby the cell impedance is stabilized for every flow rate and the electrode potential
is representative of the flow rate.The document EP-A-0 310 026 discloses a heart pacemaker comprising a pulse
generator for generating stimulation pulses, a single sensor with a pacing electrode
positioned in a patient's right heart for deriving a signal modulated with a multiplicity of
physiological functional parameters related to a patient's condition such as changes in
volume, flow or pressure in the patient's vascular system.The object of the present invention is to achieve a new
method and a new device for measuring the flow of an
electrolytic fluid which are simpler and require
simpler and, thus, cheaper measurement equipment.This object is achieved with a method and a device of the
kind described in the introduction with the characterizing
features set forth in claims 1 and 5 respectively.The method and
