<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for gripping a centrifuge bowl includes a single pivoting retaining 
arm (46) having a stationary jaw (50). The retaining arm is capable of pivoting into 

and out of position such that the centrifuge bowl can be loaded and unloaded. A 
moveable jaw (50c) pivots about the retaining arm to lock the stem of the centrifuge 

bowl against the stationary jaw when actuated by a latching mechanism (48). At the 
same time, a catch (55) on the latching mechanism locks the retaining arm to a latching 

shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
Disposable blood processing centrifuge bowels include a
rotary bowl body portion having a separation chamber for
separation whole blood into constituent components. The rotary
bowl body portion is commonly connected to a stem portion with
a rotary seal. The stem portion includes an inlet port which
allows whole blood to enter the centrifuge bowl and an outlet
port which allows separated blood components to exit. The
rotary seal allows the rotary bowl body portion to rotate
independently of the stem portion so that the inlet and outlet
ports can remain stationary.Disposable centrifuge bowls required a chuck mechanism
for securing the centrifuge bowl to the rotating mechanism
during operation and a gripping mechanism for preventing
rotation of the stem portion, for deflecting the rotary seal
and for axially aligning the bowl in the chuck mechanism.
Previous methods of securing centrifuge bowls within
centrifuges have been time consuming and cumbersome. A common
method of retaining the centrifuge bowl is by gripping the
centrifuge bowl at a steam portion just below the inlet and
outlet ports between two pivoting members. A locking device
locks the two pivoting members together about the centrifuge
bowl. See, for example, U.S. 4,889,524, Figure 2, U.S.
3,581,981, Figure 9 and U.S. 3,317,127, Figure 7.DE-A-1,237,360 describes an apparatus for gripping a centrifuge bowl having an
arm for gripping the stem of the bowl. The arm has a jaw and a slideable lock which
can be slid open to allow the stem to enter the jaw. Once the stem is inserted into the
jaw, the lock is slid into place, trapping the stem between itself and the jaw.A drawback of gripping a centrifuge bowl with two pivoting
members is that a number of steps must be performed in order to
secure the centrifuge bowl. Each pivoting member must be
independently swung into position about the centrifuge bowl
while depressing the header of the centrifuge bowl and then 
locked in place with the blocking device. This adds to the
time required to perform a blood processing operation.Accordingly, there is a need for an improved apparatus and
method of gripping a centrifuge bowl which is easier and faster
then previous attempts.According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for gripping a
centrifuge bowl having a stem and a flange of predetermined shape, the apparatus
comprising:
a retaining arm having a stationary jaw for engaging the stem; anda moveable jaw; characterised in that the apparatus further comprises:means for pivotably securing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for gripping a centrifuge bowl having a stem (22a) and a
flange (24) of predetermined shape (46), the apparatus comprising:


a retaining arm (46) having a stationary jaw (50) for engaging the stem (22a);
and
a moveable jaw (50c); characterised in that the apparatus further comprises:
means (48) for pivotably securing the moveable jaw to the retaining arm such
that pivoting of the moveable jaw secures the stem between the stationary and moveable

jaws;
a first spring (82) secured to the retaining arm and to the moveable jaw, for
urging the moveable jaw away from the stem; and
a latching mechanism (48) affixed to the retaining arm for retaining the
moveable jaw in fixed engagement with the stem.
The apparatus of Claim 1 in which the latching mechanism comprises a cam
block (80) secured to the moveable jaw by a second spring (76) that transmits force

from the cam block to the moveable jaw.
The apparatus of Claim 2 in which the latching mechanism further comprises:

a rotatable handle (48a); and
a member (88) secured to the handle and communicating with the cam block
such that rotation of the handle causes the cam block to revolve about the first pivot so

as to rotate the movable jaw in opposition to the urging by the first spring.
The apparatus of claim 2 or 3 wherein the second spring is disposed to allow
relative angular motion between the moveable jaw and the cam block to accommodate

the size of the stem.
The apparatus of claim 3 or 4 further comprising:

a support block (40) for supporting the retaining arm; 
a latching shaft (53) affixed to the support block; and
a catch (55) affixed to the handle (48a) for securing the handle to the latching
shaft.
The apparatus of claim 5 in which the handle is configured such that rotation
thereof to rotate the moveable jaw to secure the stem between the stationary and

moveable jaws secures the catch to the latching shaft.
The apparatus according to any of the preceding claims wherein the bowl has an
outer circumference and wherein the stationary jaw is configured to provide orientation

surfaces which mate with the flange at a predetermined circumferential orientation.
The apparatus according to any of the preceding claims in which the stationary
jaw has an inner surface which is shaped to provide a mating surface which mates with

the stem.
The apparatus according to any of the preceding claims further comprising:

a support block (40); and
means (53, 55) for pivotably securing the retaining arm to the support block so
as to facilitate engagement of the stationary jaw with the stem by pivoting the retaining

arm.
An apparatus (30) for processing blood, comprising:

a centrifuge bowl (12) having a stem (22 a) and a flange (24) of predetermined
shape; and a gripping apparatus (10) according to any of the preceding claims.
The apparatus of Claim 10 in which the flange is of polygonal shape.
The apparatus of Claim 10 in which the centrifuge bowl (12) includes a rotary
seal (8a, 8b) having a curved upper surface (8a) located below the stem, the retaining 

arm (46) being shaped to engage and deflect downwardly the upper surface of the rotary
seal (8b) when the stationary jaw engages the stem.
The apparatus of claim 10 further comprising:

a chuck (130) for engaging the bowl portion of the centrifuge bowl.
