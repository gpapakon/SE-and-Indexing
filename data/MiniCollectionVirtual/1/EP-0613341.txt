<ABSTRACT>
The subject invention pertains to novel methods and compositions utilizing novel fatty acid salts which exhibit excellent herbicidal activity in controlling unwanted vegetation. The novel compositions and methods described here facilitate effective weed control using an organic amine salt of a monocarboxylic acid, wherein said monocarboxylic acid has about seven to about twenty carbon atoms, and wherein the cation formed by said salt is an aliphatic ammonium salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
Weeds cost farmers billions of dollars annually in crop losses and in the expense of
keeping weeds under control. Much of the cost of intertillage of row crops, maintenance of
fallow, seedbed preparation, and seed cleaning is chargeable to weed control. Suppression of
weeds along highways and railroad right-of-ways, and in irrigation ditches, navigation channels,
yards, parks, grounds, and home gardens also is expensive. Ragweed pollen is the source of
annual periodic distress to several million hayfever sufferers. Poison ivy, poison oak, poison
sumac, nettles, thistles, sandburs, and puncturevine also bring pain to millions. Weeds also
serve as hosts for other crop diseases as well as for insect pests.The losses caused by weeds in agricultural production environments include decrease
in crop yield, reduced crop quality, increased irrigation costs, increased harvesting costs,
decreased land value, injury to livestock, and crop damage from insects and diseases harbored
by the weeds.Chemical herbicides have provided a effective method of weed control; however, the
public has become concerned about the amount of residual chemicals which might be found
in food, ground water, and the environment. Stringent new restrictions on the use of
herbicides and the elimination of some effective herbicides from the market place could limit
economical and effective options for controlling costly weeds. Additionally, the visually
apparent phytotoxic effects ofsome systemic herbicides appear very slowly on the target weeds,
so pesticide users often seek methods by which the apparent speed of action of the herbicide
is increased.Recently, salts of fatty acids, primarily sodium or potassium fatty acid salts, have been
used commercially as pesticides. Compositions having excellent pesticidal properties which
exploit these salts are available commercially from Safer, Inc., under the trademark SAFER
INSECTICIDAL SOAP. A herbicidally active composition utilizing partially saponified fatty
acids as the active ingredient is sold by Safer, Inc. under the trademark SHARPSHOOTER.
These fatty acid compositions are effective, naturally occurring pesticides which have no known
long term environmental effects. Although fatty acid salts have herbicidal activity, it would be
desirable to provide an alternative composition having an unsaponified active ingredient while
maintaining the environmental compatibility of the pesticide and reducing the eye and skin
irritancy of the product.U.S. Patent Nos. 2,626,862; 4,975,110; and 5,035,741
