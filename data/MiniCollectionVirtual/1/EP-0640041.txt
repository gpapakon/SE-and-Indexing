<ABSTRACT>
Process for the production of plastic laminates with copper laminae on their external faces, especially for printed circuits, said laminae being obtained from a continuous band (30) passing from one face to another, by bends (32) made in one direction and the opposite one alternatively, of the various packages placed one above the other, which band (30) being connected at its two ends (36, 37) to a generator (72) of electricity acts as a set of electric resistances generating the necessary heat for producing, when adequate pressure is exerted on the packages by a cold press (60), close association among the various component parts and so forming plastic laminates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns the processes for production of 
plastic laminates with metal laminae. Generally speaking, plastic laminates consist of sheets 
formed of several layers of plastic materials, associated 
together in a stable manner, usually by pressing, on 
a base of paper, fabrics, fibreglass or other materials. The plastic materials may be of phenol, melamine, epoxy, 
polyester, silicon, fluoride or others. In the production of printed circuits a metal lamina, 
usually of copper, is made to adhere to one or both sides 
during the pressing process. A pile of packages, all virtually the same, is formed 
each of these comprising a number of sheets, impregnated 
with plastic materials, and copper laminae one of which 
is placed on each side of the package. A sheet of metal, stainless steel or some other kind, is 
placed between each package, and the pile so formed is 
put inside a multiple-plate press that provides heat and 
pressure simultaneously. When each heat cycle, in which a temperature of 190°C  
 
may be reached at pressures of up to 100 kg/cm2, lasting 
over 100 minutes and including a cooling stage down to 
70-80°C, has been terminated, a compact and rigid product 
is obtained whose single components are closely associated. Presses suited to this kind of production must necessarily 
be complex and will give a low output due to having 
many heating plates, to having to produce heat and pressure 
at the same time in well-defined and accurate sequences, 
to their needing to create, by conduction, uniform 
temperatures throughout the various packages in the pile 
of which obviously only those at the top and bottom will 
be in contact with the heating plates. Particularly, the propagation of calories from the press's 
heating plates to the piled up packages, and of units of 
refrigeration during the cooling stage, is greatly hindered 
by having to pass through components made of fibreglass 
impregnated with plastic materials, or others equally 
insulating materials, which are known to be very poor conductors 
of heat, in the packages above and below such material in 
the pile. In addition to complicating the structure of the press, 
the presence of many heating plates slows down loading 
and unloading of packages, while problems are created for 
short runs of production these being relatively more costly. Subject of the invention is a process for production of 
plastic laminates with metal laminae, especially for printed 
circuits, which comprises formation of piles of packages 
each one

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing plastic laminates with metal laminae, 
especially for printed circuits, by formation of 

piles (20,80) of packages (21,81) each comprising a group 
(22-24) of supporting sheets (25) impregnated with plastic 

material and with metal laminae on the faces,
 
characterized in that the metal laminae are obtained from 

a continuous metal band (30,95) laid at the lower face of 
the first group (22) of sheets (25) starting from the bottom 

and above a first metal sheet (40), and then, on making a 
bend 32 at 180°, it is laid on the upper face of said group 

(22) and, after a metal sheet (41) has been placed on the 
band and after the band has made a second bend (34) at 180° 

in the direction opposite to the first, said band is placed 
upon the metal sheet (41) and at the lower face of the second 

group (23) of sheets and then, having made a third bend at 
180° in the direction opposite to the second bend, said band 

is laid on the upper face of this second group (23) of 
sheets (25) and so on by placing a metal sheet (42,43) between 

each two consecutive bends of the (metal) band, until 
the upper face of the last group (24) of sheets (25) has 

been reached, the two ends (36,37-96,97) of the band (95) 
being connected to a generator (72,94) of electricity of 

adequate power so that by generating adequate pressure on 
the pile (20,80) of packages (21,81) and the eletric circuit 

of the generator (72,94) having been closed, the various 
lengths (31) (33) (35) of the band (30,95) matching with 

the faces of the packages (21,81) act as electric resistances 
creating close association among the various parts and formation 

of plastic laminates.  
 
Process as in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the pressure on the pile (20) of packages 

(21) is obtained by inserting said pile (20) inside 
a cold press (60). 
Process as in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the pressure on the pile (80) of packages 

is determined by placing said pile (80) inside an 
autoclave (90). 
Process as in claim 1,
 
characterized in that each pile (20) of packages (21) is 

placed first inside a die (50) with its upper (51) and 
lower (52) plates connected by pins (53) (54) for support 

and guidance, it being thus possible to apply the pressure 
needed for the process onto said die (50). 
Process as in claim 4,
 
characterized in that the pressure on the die (50) is obtained 

by placing it inside a cold press (60). 
Process as in claim 4,
 
characterized in that the pressure on the die (50) is obtained 

by placing it inside an autoclave (90). 
Process as in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the band (30) is made of copper. 
Process as in claims 1
 
characterized in that the pressure on the pile (80) of packages 

is determined by placing said pile (80) inside an autoclave 
(90), the pile (80) of packages put inside it being 

comprised between a plate (83) fixed to the bottom of 
the autoclave and a plate (87) fixed to the inside of 

a lid (91), there being placed on said plates (83, 87) 
conducting laminae (84, 88) in a position to contact the  

 
lower and upper sides of the pile (80) of packages and thus 

to come in contact with the two ends (96, 97) of the serpentine-wise 
metal band (95) with which the pile (80) of packages 

is formed, said laminae (84, 88) being connected with a 
generator (94) of electricity, the plate (87) being held 

to the inside of the lid (91) by elastic means (85) so 
that by closing the lid (91), closure is automatically 

secured of the circuit between the generator (94) and 
the metal band (95), thereby enabling the start of the pressing 

process already described.
