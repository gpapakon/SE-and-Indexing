34B), and first and second inverters (26, 25) coupled 
in a ring, where the first node (37) couples an input 

of the first inverter (26) and an output of the second 
inverter (25) and receiving the first voltage, and the 

second node (36) couples an output of the first 
inverter and an input of the second inverter and 

receiving the second voltage, a first impedance element 
(32) coupled between the first power line and the third 

node of the flip-flop circuit, a second impedance 
element (34) coupled between the second power line and 

the fourth node of the flip-flop circuit, and a switch 
(35), coupled between the third and fourth nodes of the 

flip-flop circuit, for electrically connecting the 
third and fourth nodes in an ON state and for 

disconnecting the third and fourth nodes in an OFF 
state in response to a reset control signal (SC), where 

the switching means is turned ON when resetting the 
flip-flop type amplifier circuit and is turned OFF 

after the resetting, in response to the reset control 
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
amplifier circuits, and more particularly to a flip-flop
type amplifier circuit which is used in a sense
amplifier or the like of a semiconductor memory device
such as a static random access memory (SRAM) and a
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) when amplifying an
latching a minute voltage difference between two
voltages.Conventionally, there is a flip-flop type
amplifier circuit having a construction shown in FIG.1.
In FIG.1, a node 1 is supplied with one voltage VIN1,
and a node 2 is supplied with another voltage VIN2. A
voltage difference between these voltages VIN1 and VIN2
is to be amplified and latched by the flip-flop type
amplifier circuit.A flip-flop circuit 3 includes complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) inverters 4 and 5.
More particularly, the flip-flop circuit 3 includes p-channel
MOS transistors (hereinafter simply referred to
as pMOS transistors) 6 and 7 which form load elements,
and n-channel MOS transistors (hereinafter simply
referred to as nMOS transistors) 8 and 9 which form
driving elements. In other words, the pMOS transistor
6 and the nMOS transistor 8 form the CMOS inverter 4,
and the pMOS transistor 7 and the nMOS transistor 9
form the CMOS inverter 5, and these CMOS inverters 4
and 5 are connected in a ring.The flip-flop type amplifier circuit also
includes a power line 10 for supplying a high voltage
side power supply voltage Vcc of 3 V, for example, a
pMOS transistor 11 for activating the flip-flop circuit
3, an nMOS transistor 12 for activating the flip-flop
circuit 3, an inverter 13, and a node 14. An 
activation control signal SA for controlling ON
(conducting) and OFF (non-conducting) states of the
pMOS transistor 11 and the nMOS transistor 12 to
control the activation of the flip-flop circuit 3 is
supplied to this node 14.When the activation control signal SA has the
voltage Vcc (high level), the pMOS transistor 11 is ON,
the nMOS transistor 12 is ON and the flip-flop circuit
3 is active.On the other hand, when the activation
control signal SA has a voltage of 0 V (low level), the
pMOS transistor 11 is OFF, the nMOS transistor 12 is
OFF and the flip-flop circuit 3 is inactive.The flip-flop type amplifier circuit further
includes an analog switch 15 made up of a CMOS transfer
gate circuit for resetting, and an inverter 16. A
reset control signal SB for controlling ON and OFF
states of the analog switch 15 is supplied to a node
17.When the reset control signal SB has a
voltage of 0 V, the analog switch 15 is ON and
input
