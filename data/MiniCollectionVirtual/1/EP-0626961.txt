<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds
having pharmaceutical activity.EP-A-0392803 (Beecham Group p.l.c.) discloses certain azabicyclic
compounds which enhance acetylcholine function via an action at
muscarinic receptors within the central nervous system.These compounds are therefore of potential use in the treatment and/or
prophylaxis of dementia in mammals. Various preparative methods are
also disclosed.Organic Functional Group preparations (Academic Press) Vol.III (1972),
pp367, 381 provides a review of methods of nitrosation of active methylene
compounds.We have now developed an improved process for the preparation of one
class of the compounds disclosed in EP-A-0392803.The present invention provides process for the preparation of a compound
of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:

wherein R1 represents

r represents an integer of 2 to 4, s represents 1 or 2 and t represents 0 or
1; 
said process comprising nitrosating with a nitrosating agent in the
presence of a base a compound of formula (II):

wherein R1' is R1 or a group convertible thereto, and
thereafter converting the resulting =NOH group to =NOCH3,
converting R1' when other than R1 to R1, and
thereafter optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.Compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in a number of
stereoisomeric forms including geometric isomers such as syn and anti
and, for certain compounds, enantiomers. The different stereoisomeric
forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods.Compounds of formula (I) having two asymetric centres which have the
stereochemical configuration in which the group -C(CN)=NOCH3 and the
(CH2)s bridge are on the same side of the plane of the molecule which
contains both bridgehead atoms and the ring carbon atom bonded to the
aforesaid group will hereinafter be referred to as having the exo
configuration.If desired, the compounds of formula (I) can be formed into add addition
salts with adds, such as the conventional pharmaceutically acceptable
adds, for example hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, acetic, fumaric,
salicylic, citric, lactic, mandelic, tartaric, oxalic and methanesulphonic.The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt encompasses solvates and
hydrates. Thus where compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof form solvates or hydrates, these also form an
aspect of the invention.Preferred combinations of (r,s,t) include (2,2,0), (2,1,1), (3,1,1), (2,1,0) and
(3,1,0), most preferably
