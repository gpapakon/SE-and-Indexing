<ABSTRACT>
A releasable pressure sensitive adhesive composition 
comprising: 


(a) a block copolymer comprising at least one poly(monovinyl 
aromatic hydrocarbon) block and at least one poly(conjugated 

diene) block and having a vinyl content of at least 3% by

(b) a tackifying resin, and 
(c) a plasticizer, 
 
wherein the block copolymer has been cross-linked through its vinyl 

groups by means of a reaction with an organohydrogenpolysiloxane 
crosslinking agent containing at least two hydrogen atoms being 

directly bonded to a silicon atom in the presence of a crosslinking 
catalyst and wherein the plasticizer is present in an amount of 

from 1 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of block 
copolymer. 
The releasable adhesive composition can be suitably applied in 
removable self-adhering memo notes and in removable tapes and 

labels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a releasable, pressure
sensitive adhesive composition. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a releasable, pressure sensitive adhesive
composition comprising a cross-linked block copolymer based on a
conjugated diene and a vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon.Releasable pressure sensitive adhesives are used in numerous
applications wherein tackiness as well as removability without
leaving traces of adhesives on the substrate -even after repeated
use- are required. Specific examples include self-adhering memo
labels, removable tapes and reusable closure systems, such as
closures of packages containing tissues. Several adhesive
compositions meeting the above requirements have already been
proposed in the past. For instance, US-A-4,680,333 discloses a
removable pressure sensitive hot melt adhesive composition
comprising an ABA type block copolymer, with A being polystyrene
and B polyisoprene, and a substantial amount (up to 50% by weight
of the composition) of aliphatic hydrocarbon resin having a
softening point of less than 30Â°C. Such hydrocarbon resins mainly
include liquid tackifying resins. In addition to these components
other components, such as high softening point aliphatic
hydrocarbon resins, i.e. solid tackifying resins, mineral oil or
petroleum, metallic salts of fatty acids and antioxidants, may be
present too.WO 88/01631 and WO 88/01636 both relate to a readhering and
releasable gelled solid adhesive for coating substrates,
particularly paper, comprising a rubber component, a water-soluble
or water-dispersible tackifying agent and a gelling agent. A
friction reducing agent comprising a polyhydric aliphatic alcohol
may be present as well. Natural rubber latex is stated to be the 
preferred rubber component. Preferred gelling agent is sodium
stearate.EP-A-0,443,263 discloses a repositionable adhesive coated
substrate whereby the adhesive layer comprises 20 to 80% by weight
of an elastomeric styrene/butadiene, styrene/isoprene or
styrene/ethylene-butylene block copolymer, the balance up to 100%
by weight being a tackifier material. This tackifier material is
either a tackifying resin (liquid and/or solid) or a blend of a
tackifying resin and a liquid plasticizer oil. The purpose of the
tackifier material is to modify the composite midblock glass
transition temperature (CMTg), which is taught to be an important
parameter for the properties of the adhesive composition.Although the releasable and readherable adhesive compositions
