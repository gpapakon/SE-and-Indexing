<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in an
ink jet head for discharging ink which is applied to an ink
jet system. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an improved ink jet head free of debonding
between a substrate for an ink jet head and ink flow path
walls formed on said substrate. The present invention
includes an ink jet apparatus which is provided with said
ink jet head.In recent years, progressively increasing attention
has been paid to an ink jet system for conducting printing
on a printing medium by discharging ink droplets towards
said printing medium, since it can provide high speed, high
density and high definition printing of a high quality at
low noise and it is suitable for color printing and also
for compact designing.An ink jet head which serves as a mechanism for
discharging ink in such ink jet system is the most
important factor for the ink jet system. The ink jet head 
has an extremely precise structure. Description will be
made of such ink jet head with reference to FIG. 4. FIG. 4
is a schematically exploded view illustrating an example of
the constitution of the ink jet head.In FIG. 4, reference numeral 101 indicates a silicon
substrate for an ink jet head, having an electrothermal
converting element as a discharging energy-generating
element including heat generating resistors 103 and wirings
102 for said hear generating resistors formed on said
silicon substrate by means of the thin-film forming
technique. On the silicon substrate 101 having the
electrothermal converting element thereon, there is
disposed an ink flow path wall made of a photosensitive
resin or the like of forming ink pathway walls 104a and a
common ink chamber wall 104b. Reference numeral 105
indicates a top plate joined onto the ink flow path wall
104 such that it covers concaves formed by the ink flow
path wall 104 to form ink pathways 108a and a common ink
chamber 108b. Each ink pathway 108a contains the above-described
heat generating resistor 103 positioned therein.
Reference numeral 109 indicates an ink discharging outlet
positioned at an end portion of the silicon substrate which
is communicated with the ink pathway 108a. Reference
numeral 107 indicates a common ink supply port disposed at
the top plate 105. The common ink supply port 107 is 
covered by a filter 106 for ink which is fixed to the top
plate 107.There are various proposals as for the process of
producing an ink jet head of the constitution above
described. U.S. Pat. No. 4,657,631 describes a typical
process for
