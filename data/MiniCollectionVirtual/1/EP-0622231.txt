<ABSTRACT>
A thermal printer (12) carries out printing operations to produce 
images in multiple colors in response to a printing program. In order to 

eliminate distortions and to insure registration of colors in the printed image, 
a printer controller (20) eliminates backlash in the drive mechanism at the 

beginning of each printing operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
printing on sheet material and is particularly useful for printing signs and 
other artistic designs in accordance with a printing program. Relevant 
prior art is described in JP-A-63 286 378. Thermal printing apparatus as described in EP-A-0 607 539 
(prior art according to Art. 54(3)EPC) can be used 
to generate signs, designs, characters and other graphic images on a strip of 
sheet material in accordance with a stored printing program. The program is 
read and translated into machine commands by a microprocessor-based 
controller and causes the stored image to be generated on the strip of sheet 
material by the printer. The printer is a thermal printer having a 
thermal printhead mounted in stationary relationship with respect to the strip 
of sheet material during a printing operation, and the strip of sheet material is 
fed under the printhead by a mechanical drive mechanism. The controller 
coordinates the operation of the printhead and the mechanical drive 
mechanism in order to place the printed image at a desired location on the 
strip of material. In one form, the strip of material is a strip of vinyl secured to 
a backing material by a pressure sensitive adhesive so that after printing the 
vinyl bearing a printed image can be cut and stripped from the backing 
material and thereafter placed on an appropriate sign board. The thermal printer may utilize a web 
of thermally releasable inking material to produce images in color. Multi-colored 
images can be produced by the printer simply by passing the strip of 
sheet material through the printer relative to the printhead two or more times 
and substituting a web bearing an inking material of a different color on each  
 
pass. When the images are produced in separate passes and, therefore at 
different times, small misalignments between the images or distortions of just 
one image may create noticeable errors or defects that detract from or totally 
destroy the resulting product. Many printed products such as commercial 
signs or artwork require high quality printing without notable distortion or 
registration errors. Such errors can arise at the beginning of each printed 
image simply because of backlash in the drive mechanism that moves the 
sheet material relative to the printhead. It is accordingly the problem to be solved by the present invention to 
provide a method and apparatus by which the distortion and error associated 
with backlash are eliminated from images that are

<CLAIMS>
A printing apparatus for printing in multiple colors on sheet material including: a 
printhead (70) responsive to a printing program defining a printing operation 

for placing a printed image on a sheet material (S), 
a donor web (W) bearing a printing ink of one selected 

color and being replaceable to permit printing in 
different colors, structure (88) for supporting the donor 

web bearing ink between the printhead (70) and the sheet 
material (S) to enable the print head to transfer the ink 

selectively from the web to the sheet material  
 

a drive mechanism 
(36,30,32) coupled with the sheet material for moving the 

sheet material relative to the printhead during a printing 
operation in a printing direction to place the printed image on the sheet material, and a controller 

(20) connected with the printhead (70) and the drive mechanism and 
responsive to the printing program for coordinating the operation of the 

printhead and the drive mechanism to place the printed image on the sheet 
material (S) relative to an origin point which is also defined in the program, 

the controller (20) also including a backlash eliminator 
(122,134) actuating the drive mechanism (36,30,32) and displacing the 

sheet material (S) relative to the printhead (70) by at least an 
incremental amount opposite to and then in the printing direction with each replacement of 

the donor web (W) prior to beginning a printing operation at the origin point.  
 
A printing apparatus for printing as defined in claim 1 wherein: 
the drive mechanism (30,32) engages and moves the sheet material back 

and forth relative to the printhead (70), the controller controls the back and 
forth movement of the sheet material (S) to cause the material to make 

multiple passes by the printhead in response to the printing program, and 
characterized in that the backlash eliminatior (122,134) causes the drive 

mechanism to advance the sheet material incrementally relative to the 
printhead in the printing direction prior to the beginning of each pass by the 

printhead. 
A printing apparatus for printing as defined in claim 1 or 2 
characterized in that the backlash eliminator includes a backspacer (134) for 

returning the sheet material after a pass by the printhead to a position in 
advance of the starting point for the printed information.  

 
A printing apparatus for printing as defined in any one of the 
foregoing claims wherein the printhead (70) is moveable into and out of 

contact with the sheet material and characterized in that the controller 
(20,118,126) causes the printhead (70) to move into contact with the 

sheet material before the material is incrementally advanced prior to the 
start of printing, and causes the printhead to move out of contact with 

the strip of sheet material prior to returning the sheet material. 
A method of printing images defined in a printing program in multiple colors on 
sheet material in a machine controlled by the program and having a 

printhead (70), 
a donor web (W) bearing a printing ink of one selected 

color and being replaceable to permit printing in 
different colors, structure (88) for supporting the donor 

web bearing ink between the printhead (70) and the sheet 
material (S) to enable the print head to transfer the ink 

selectively from the web to the sheet material  
 

and drive means (36,30,32) for moving the sheet material (S) 
relative to the printhead (70) in a printing direction during a printing operation, comprising 

the step of energizing the drive means to move the sheet material 
(S) relative to the printhead (70) by at least an incremental amount opposite to and then in 

the printing direction with each replacement of the donor web (W) to remove 
backlash in the drive means before energizing the printhead to print images 

on the sheet material.  
 
A method of printing as defined in claim 5 characterized in that 
the step of moving the sheet material in the direction opposite to the printing 

direction allows the subsequent energizing and movement of the sheet 
material by at least an incremental amount in the printing direction to place the 

printhead (70) in the same position with respect to the sheet material as 
when the printhead was originally energized to print 
images. 
A method of printing as defined in claim 5 or 6 characterized 
by placing the printhead (70) in contact with the sheet material during the 

movement of the sheet material in the printing direction, and holding the printhead out 
of contact with the sheet material during the movement of the sheet material in the 

direction opposite to the printing direction.  
 
A method of printing as defined in claim 5, 6 or 7 characterized in that the 
step of generating images with the printhead (70) during movement of the 

sheet material in the printing direction includes generating images in one color 
and after again energizing the drive means a further 

step includes generating images with the printhead (70) in another color 
during movement of the sheet material in the printing direction.
