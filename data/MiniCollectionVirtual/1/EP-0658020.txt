<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a high security remote actuating 
intelligent system consisting of control or telecommand units and 

a decoder unit for bidirectional transmisions which has digital 
identifiers for each telecommand which are installated during 

manufacturing process, allowing dymanic encoding of information 
transmitted between transmitters and the receiver, furthermore 

it detects and point up the presence of active telecommands whose 
identifier doesn't belong to the telecommands authorized by the 

manufacturer of the system. Message encoding is made in such a 
way that the composition of the digital raster sent between the 

telecommand and the decoding unit, presents a random variation 
from one transmission to the following one, thus preventing any 

attempt of message reconstuction from successive sampling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a high security remote actuating 
encoded system through a combination of the dynamic encoding 
of the information transmitted and the intelligent programming 
of the number and identification of the telecommands 
encompassing the same, differentiating those normally 
automatically recognized from the extraordinary one which can 
be learnt, and externally noting the presence of these latter 
when detected by the decoder. The system is characterized, on the one hand, by the high 
degree of security derived from the encoding or dynamic 
encryption of the information transmitted between the 
different transmitters or telecommands and the receiver and, 
on the other hand, by the training method or the programming 
of the number and identification of the different transmitters 
or telecommands ascribed to the system. This feature prevents the infringement of the security 
implicit to the system, by the introduction of "hidden" 
commands without the prior knowledge of the system's user, 
both during the programming stage and afterwards, by third 
parties related to the user who should access the system, for 
instance, maintenance services or third parties external to 
the system. The only thing which is necessary is that, during the 
manufacturing process, a predetermined set of telecommand 
identifiers, which can be automatically recognized and their 
access authorized by the system, is recorded on non volatile  
 
memory, thus allowing the learning or programming of each 
telecommand included in such set. This allows, in turn, to learn and use a certain number of 
extra commands which do not belong to the set previously 
defined at the plant, externally indicating their presented 
provided that the system is activated or not through the prior 
intermediary of any of the previous telecommands. Its immediate use, regardless of other similar or more 
interesting uses, would be their applicability to other remote 
control activities in security systems, specifically alarms 
for mobile or fixed equipments, access control systems, 
military communications and others The information encoding or dynamic encryption methods using 
algorithms of different levels of complexity, such as IBM 
"Data Encryption System" (DES) using 64 bits and which are a 
hybrid of the securing method by transposition of the message 
characters and their replacement by other random characters 
and of the also well known RSA (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) 
method which uses the factoring of numbers composed by big 
pri
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A high security remote actuating intelligent system 
formed, on the one hand, by one or more control or telecommand 

units consisting of a Microchip microcontroller (1), a signal 
modulation and broadcast unit (2) which can be relayed by any 

means, and a receiving and demodulating module (3) for 
bidirectional transmissions and, on the other hand, by a 

decoding unit formed by a Microchip microcontroller (4), a 
signal receiver / demodulator (5), a non volatile memory (7) 

for the telecommand identifiers and their reiterative control, 
plus a signal modulation / reception module (6), for 

bidirectional transmissions and, along with both units, their 
signal transmitters (8) and (8') with 2m (m =
<
 64 bits) 
digital identifiers for each telecommand and unambiguously 

identified by this digital code in the decoder. It is 
essentially characterized because the electronic access to the 

identifiers of the telecommands is not possible from outside 
without seriously damaging or destroying the non volatile 

EEPROM memory (7) and because during the manufacturing process 
only a maximum "k" number of fixed identifiers equal to the 

number of telecommand units of the system is authorized to 
operate within any individual system under normal conditions. 

Such identifiers are sent by the decoding unit to the external 

signalling system (9) which duly indicates the enabling / 
disabling of the system. If the identifier is different from 

those authorized for the operation under normal conditions, 
the system is not enabled/disabled and the signalling system 

(9) indicates its presence. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the previous claim, characterized because each 

individual and specific system formed by some specific 
telecommands and a specific decoder to which a given number 

of "n" identifiers equal or lower than "k" is ascribed, can 
 

be subject to a previous training or programming reiterative 
process at any given moment and which cannot be accessed by 

the user of the system but which is activated by the decoding 
unit through the input lines of the microcontroller which 

enables this unit to know the still active telecommands when 
"n" is lower than "k". 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the previous claims, characterized because the 

decoding unit can accept an additional "j" number of ancillary 
telecommands during such training or programming process, the 

identifiers of which were not authorized in the memory (7) 
which recognizes them as valid after the training or 

programming process. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the previous claims, characterized because the 

decoding unit detects the presence of any of the "j" ancillary 
active telecommands already recognized as valid and indicates 

them externally and specifically through the external multiple 
signalling system (9) which indicates the correct enabling / 

disabling of the system while if the identifier is different 
from those now authorized as ancillary, the system is not 

enabled / disabled and the signalling system (9) indicates its 
presence. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the previous claims, characterized because the 

system formed by the telecommand units and the decoding unit 
also incorporates a dynamic non reiterative and randomized 

encoding of the information the raster of which is digitally 
transmitted from the control units to the decoding unit. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the previous claims, characterized because the 

 
system formed by the telecommand units and the decoding unit 

has a redundant security system consisting of the additional 
comparison of the raster which is being received by the 

decoder from the telecommand with that available in the non 
volatile memory (7) from the last transmission. If this 

comparison is consistent, the system replaces the raster by 
the last one received and actuates the requested enabling / 

disabling. On the contrary, it indicates the incorrect 
reception in (9) through the output line (11) of the decoding 

unit. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the previous claim, characterized because when 

the incorrect reception has been indicated, the system admits 
the synchronization of the telecommand for verification. 

During such verification, the decoding unit does not decode 
the information received in the raster but only verifies the 

presence of an erroneous format. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the above claims, characterized because the 

decoder interfaces with an alarm unit, external to the claimed 
system, through the input / output lines (11) which enable 

external communications. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the above claims, characterized because the 

transmission of the information can be achieved either through 
a radiofrequency, electric, optic or any other signal. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the above claims, where this system is the 

actuator incorporated to an alarm for motor vehicles, 
characterized because the microcontrollers (1) of the 

telecommand units and the microcontroller (4) of the decoding 
 

unit are Microchip; because the interface with the use is 
achieved through the telecommand key (10); because a one-way 

transmission system is defined, i.e. optionally the receiving 
and modulating module (3) of the control unit and the relevant 

module (6) of the decoder have been eliminated and, 
additionally, because the binary raster available for 

transmission by the telecommand is of 64 bits and the digital 
code has "m" = 24 bits, i.e. there are 2²⁴ different 

identifiers for each telecommand. 
A high security remote actuating intelligent system, 
according to the previous claims, characterized because there 

are "n" = 4 fixed identifiers, two of them for two 
telecommands authorized during the manufacturing process to 

operate under normal conditions and another two in reserve for 
an eventual extended use, and another "j" = 1 as a unique 

ancillary identifier.
