<ABSTRACT>
a) Apparatus for crimping a tube in a thick plate. b) The apparatus is characterised in that the peripheral support (9) is a sleeve formed by contiguous fingers (91) separated by slits (93), the fingers being connected to a non-split ring (2) at the other end of the support (9), and the free end of the fingers (91) forms a cam surface intended to interact with the surface (82) of the cam (8).

Device for securing a tube in a thick 
plate, comprising: 


a source of hydraulic fluid under very 
great pressure; 
a pin (1) which is intended to be slid 
into the tube to be secured (4) in the 

location of the connection to be formed 
in the plate (5); 
the pin (1) carrying two sealing means 
delimiting, with the tube to be secured, 

an annular expansion chamber (3) housing 
the fluid under pressure; 
each sealing means being composed, on the 
chamber side (2), by one or a plurality 

of resilient deformable seals (6, 7) 
which are intended to close the chamber 

(3) between the pin (1) and the tube (4) 
to be secured, and a bearing device 

placed on the other side of the seals (6, 
7) in order to support them during the 

pressurization of the chamber (3) and to 
prevent creeping of the seals (6, 7) when  

 
the internal section of the tube (4) to 

be secured increases during the securing; 
this bearing device being formed by an 
annular cam (8) with a conical surface 

having a constant bearing surface (83) on 
the side facing the seals (6, 7), and a 

peripheral support having a conical cam 
surface (94) corresponding to that (82) 

of the cam (8) in order to be expanded by 
the annular cam (8) and to occupy the 

space between the annular cam (8) and the 
internal wall of the tube (4) during the 

securing; 
 
the device being characterized in that the 

peripheral support (9) is a sleeve formed by 
fingers (91) arranged edge to edge and separated 

by slots (93), the fingers being connected to a 
non-slotted collar (2) at the other end of the 

support (9) and the free ends of the fingers (91) 
forming the said conical cam surface (94) for 

cooperating with the surface (82) of the annular 
cam (8). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the fingers (91) are 

parallel to the axis of the sleeve (9).
