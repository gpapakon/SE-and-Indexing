<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for the manufacture of coarse 
and fine products, such as normal and ultra-fine cement, in 

a plant comprising at least a mill (1) classifying 
separator (3), a separation cyclone (5) and a dust 

collector (7). By this method some of the dust-laden 
conveying gas which is extracted via the cyclone gas outlet 

duct (11) is diverted to and deducted in the dust collector 
(7), and the dust from the dust collector (7) is utilized 

as the fine product, whereas the cyclone material from the 
material outlet (9) of the cyclone is utilized as coarse 

product. 
Hence it is possible to manufacture ultra-fine cement in 
existing grinding plants in a mechanically simple and 

operationally inexpensive way, while normal cement is 
simultaneously manufactured, without having any significant 

impact on the mill operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method (hereinafter
referred to as of the kind described) for treating
pulverulent material to produce coarse and fine products,
such as normal and ultra-fine cement on the basis of cement
materials such as cement clinker, gypsum, slag, limestone,
pozzuolana, flyash etc., in a plant comprising at least a
mill, a classifying separator, one or several separation
cyclones and a dust collector, by which method the material
is fed to and ground in the mill, and subsequently conveyed
to the separator in which it is divided into a coarse
fraction which is returned to the mill and into a fine
fraction which suspended in a conveying gas is conducted to
the cyclone in which the material/gas suspension is
separated into cyclone material which is discharged via the
material outlet of the cyclone and into dust-laden
conveying gas which is discharged via the gas outlet duct
of the cyclone, and whereof a partial quantity is
subsequently conducted via a further duct to, and dedusted
in, the dust collector.Apparently, there is a strong trend towards
incorporation of very fine types of cement, as for example
the so-called ultra-fine cement, in the product range of
the cement manufacturers. By ultra-fine cement is meant
cement having fineness in the range of 600-1000 m2/kg,
whereas the fineness of normal cement is in the range of
300-500 m2/kg.However, in actual practice it is difficult to
manufacture cement having the degree of fineness which
characterizes ultra-fine cement. When attempting to
manufacture ultra-fine cement by means of open-circuit
grinding, the tendency towards dry clogging will often be
so pronounced as to result in a substantial deterioration
of the grinding economy, and, further, it will often be
impossible to manufacture cement having a fineness in
excess of 800 m2/kg. It is, however, possible to 
manufacture cement having such a fineness in closed-circuit
plants, but this has the disadvantage that the circulating
load or the circulation factor across the separator will be
quite substantial, which in turns means that the specific
power consumption of both the separator and the fan will be
very high.Plants of the kind mentioned above are known for
example from DE 3908752-Al and DE 3921823-Al. In both
specifications methods are described by which cyclone
material and dust from the dust collector are intermixed.EP-A-0519535 discloses a method for separating such
materials, whereby two products of differing fineness are
produced and can be used either separately or

<CLAIMS>
A method for treating pulverulent material in a plant
comprising at least a mill (1), a classifying separator

(3), one or several separation cyclones (5) and a dust
collector (7), by which method the material is fed to and

ground in the mill (l), and subsequently conveyed to the
separator (3) in which it is divided into a coarse fraction

which is returned to the mill (1) and a fine fraction which
suspended in a conveying gas is conducted to the cyclone

(5) in which the material/gas suspension is separated into
cyclone material which is discharged via the material

outlet (9) of the cyclone and into dust-laden conveying gas
which is discharged via the gas outlet duct (11) of the

cyclone, and whereof a partial quantity is subsequently
conducted via a further duct (12) to, and dedusted in,

the dust collector (7), characterized in that the dust is
extracted from the dust collector (7) and utilized as a

fine product; in that the cyclone material is utilized as
a coarse product; and in that the fineness and/or the

chemical composition of the fine product is adjusted by
addition of dust-loaded conveying gas extracted from and/or

before the cyclone (5).
A method according to claim 1, in which the fineness
and/or the chemical composition of the fine product is

also adjusted by addition of cyclone material.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which the
dust-loaded conveying gas extracted from the cyclone (5)

and used to adjust the fineness and/or chemical composition
of the fine product is extracted by means of a fan (17) via

one or several openings (13) - eccentrically arranged
relative to the gas outlet duct (11) - in the top of the

cyclone (5). 
A method according to claim 2 and any one of the
preceding claims, in which the dust-loaded conveying gas

extracted before the cyclone (5) and used to adjust the
fineness and/or chemical composition of the fine product is

extracted via an opening (15) in the inlet duct of the
cyclone (5) by means of a fan (17).
A method according to claim 3 or claim 4, in which the
dust in the extracted dust-loaded conveying gas is

outlet duct (11) of the cyclone (5) prior to the
introduction into the dust collector (7).
A method according to claim 2, in which some of the
