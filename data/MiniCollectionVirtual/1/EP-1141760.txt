<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to panoramic image sensing of a super wide-angle field of view, and in
particular, it relates to such image sensing using a two-mirror subsystem that is substantially self-corrected.
The term "panoramic" means a 360° field of view in a horizontal plane while the term
"super wide-angle" means a 120° or larger field of view in a vertical plane. Preferably, the field of
view in a vertical plane is greater than about 180°. More preferably, it is greater than about 200°.
And, for the desired apparatus, most preferably, it is greater than about 260°.A perspective imaging system collects rays of light from the scene that pass through a single
point of reference and projects them onto a sensing element such as film or a charge coupled device
(CCD). The single point of reference in the perspective imaging system is known as the viewpoint of
the system. Yamazawa et al., "Omnidirectional Imaging with Hyperboloidal Projection", IEEE
international Conference on Robotics and Automation, 1993, by Nalwa, "A True Omnidirectional
Viewer", ATT Bell Laboratories Technical Memorandum, BL0115500-960115-01, Jan. 1996 and by
Nayar, "Omnidirectional Video Camera", DARPA Image Understanding Workshop, May 1997
describe the need for a single viewpoint. We have determined that
the nature of light propagation through the imaging system and the shape of imaging sensor may
introduce geometric transformations in the image projected onto the sensing element. In a large
number of applications including surveillance, remote sensing, navigation, model acquisition, virtual
reality, computer vision and robotics, it is desirable that these geometric transformations be corrected
for the purposes of viewing and analysis. The lack of a single viewpoint introduces aberrations in
pupils which manifests itself as uncorrectable geometric transformations (distortions).A classification of imaging systems based on their field of view is:
1. Traditional imaging systems that image a narrow field of view, usually an octant of the sphere
of view (up to 90 degrees).2. Panoramic imaging systems that image a panorama of the scene. The field of view can be
looked upon as a sphere truncated by two parallel planes giving a 360 degree field of view in the
horizontal and a limited field of view in the vertical.3. Omnidirectional imaging systems that image substantially spherical or substantially
hemispherical fields of view.A classification of the same based on their optical components is:
1. Dioptric systems that use only refractive
