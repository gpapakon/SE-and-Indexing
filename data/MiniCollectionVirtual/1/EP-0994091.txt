<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a
production process for methanol in which a distillation system

is reduced in a size by removing efficiently heat generated in
a methanol synthesis reaction and inhibiting by-products from

being formed. The present invention provides a production process
for methanol comprising a synthetic gas production step in which

hydrocarbon is reacted with steam to generate synthetic gas
comprising main components of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and

carbon dioxide, a methanol synthesis step in which the synthetic
gas described above is reacted on a methanol synthesis catalyst

and resulting crude methanol is recovered in the form of liquid
and a distillation step in which recovered crude methanol

described above is distilled to be separated into waste water
containing low boiling organic compounds and high boiling organic

compounds and refined methanol, wherein a reactor having a
specific structure is used in the methanol synthesis step

described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a production process for
methanol, more specifically to a production process for methanol
in which a reactor having a structure capable of efficiently
removing generated heat is used in a methanol synthesis step in
producing methanol to inhibit by-products from being formed,
whereby a compact distillation step (distillation system) is
achieved.As shown, for example, in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open No. 1-180841, a conventional process for producing
methanol (CH3OH) from hydrocarbon comprises usually the following
steps (1) to (3). That is, they are:
(1) a synthetic gas production step in which gaseous hydrocarbon
or vaporized liquid hydrocarbon reacts with steam in a reforming
furnace at 800 to 1000°C in the presence of a nickel base catalyst
to produce synthetic gas comprising main components of hydrogen
(H2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2);(2) a synthesis step in which the synthetic gas described above
reacts on a copper base methanol synthesis catalyst at a pressure
of 50 to 150 atm and a temperature of 200 to 300°C and resulting
crude methanol is recovered from the reaction gas in the form of
liquid; and (3) a distillation step in which liquid crude methanol is
distilled in a distillation column comprising a single column or
two or more columns to separate refined methanol from waste water
containing organic compounds having lower boiling points than
that of methanol (hereinafter referred to as low boiling organic
compounds), organic acids and organic compounds having higher
boiling points than that of methanol (hereinafter referred to as
high boiling organic compounds).In the synthesis step (2) described above, methanol (CH3OH)
is produced from carbon monoxide (CO) contained in the synthetic
gas, and methanol (CH3OH) and water (H2O) are produced from carbon
dioxide (CO2). Impurities such as dimethyl ether, ethanol and
the like are formed by side reaction in this synthesis step.These impurities and water are contained in liquid crude
methanol together with intended methanol but separated from
methanol in the subsequent distillation step (3). In this case,
,there used to be involved the problem that if a lot of the
impurities are contained, facilities for separation and refining
in the distillation step are complicated and expanded in a size.Various reactors having means and structures for
controlling an increase in a gas temperature caused by an
exothermic reaction during operation when carrying out synthesis
