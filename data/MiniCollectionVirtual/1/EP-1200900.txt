<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus to establish communication between at least two devices (124, 128) over a network (122), includes a processor (120a) which receives from a first device (124) a telephone number portion (50) identifying a second device (128). The processor (120a) converts the telephone number portion (50) into a multiple level domain name (96) which includes the converted telephone number portion. The processor (120a) optionally appends any required prefixes or suffixes to generate a complete multiple level domain name (110). Once the complete domain name is generated, communication is established with the second device (128).

<DESCRIPTION>
 NETWORK ADDRESSING SYSTEM AND METHOD USING TELEPHONE NUMBERSCross Reference to Related ApplicationThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/143,246 filed July 9, 1999.Field of InventionThe present invention relates to network addressing over internets and intranets. The invention finds particular application in converting telephone numbers into a multi- level domain name to enable devices on a network to communicate. It is to be appreciated however, that the present invention may find further application in private networks or public networks and using private protocols or internet protocols.Background of InventionOriginally, only numbers were used as network addresses on the internet. The numbers are called Internet Protocol numbers, or m short, an IP address. These numbers had virtually no meaning to anyone and were hard to remember. Later, the Internet Assigned Number Authority (I NA) created a Domain Name System. Each domain name would use a more understandable and meaningful name to point to an IP address. For Example, * IBM.com" is a domain name that routes a user to a specific IP number or address such as 198.81.209.2 (an IBM IP address). Now, the entire world of the Internet users find themselves using this internet domain 

name registration system which is a core component m getting an internet presence.A domain name typically includes a name, plus a x ." (dot) or separator, and a Top Level Domain (TLD) such as " com" , "net", and worg" .While the domain name system made addresses easier for people to remember, the internet domain name registration system suffers from several current problems. For example, there is a limited supply of internet domain names. Only one company can own or register any given name on the internet such as Computers.com. Other top level domains can be employed such as Computers.net and Computers.org but these options are considered inferior to Computers.com. A second problem is the high cost of internet domain names. Name exclusivity has created a booming internet domain name market which has some domain names reportedly selling for millions of dollars. Also, the current monopoly and/or limited number of domain name registrants, have caused all domains m general to be more expensive. A second problem is that currently internet domain names can take up to 72 hours to activate. This creates a problem for those internet users who need to set up their site quickly. Moreover, once registered, an internet domain name is fixed. A

<CLAIMS>
Having thus described the preferred embodiments, the invention is now claimed to be:
1. A method comprising: receiving a telephone number portion identifying a device; converting the telephone number portion into a multiple level domain name identifying the device over a network, the multiple level domain name comprising the telephone number portion and a base portion; and establishing communication with the device via the multiple level domain name over the network.
2. The method as set forth m claim 1, where the telephone number portion of the multiple level domain name is subordinated to the base portion.
3. The method as set forth in claim 2, where the base portion of the multiple level domain name comprises a base level domain.
4. The method as set forth in claim 1, where the converting step comprises: adding domain separators to the received telephone number portion at determmable locations in the received telephone number portion.
5. The method as set forth in claim 1, where the received telephone number portion comprises a separator, the converting step comprising: 


 parsing the received telephone number portion for the separator; and inserting a domain separator for the parsed separator .
6. The method as set forth in claim 1, further comprising: appending additional domain levels to the converted telephone number portion to complete the multiple level domain name.
7. A method of communicating over a network comprising : receiving from a first device at least a portion of a static, multiple level domain name including d telephone number portion identifying a second device; determining availability of the second device on the network; and in response to the determining step, selectively establishing communications from the first device to the second device.
8. The method as set forth m claim 7, further comprising: establishing communications from the second device to the first device. 

9. The method as set forth m claim 7, where the determining availability step comprises: querying the second device over the network; and receiving a response from the second device indicative of second device availability.
10. An apparatus to establish communication between at least two devices over a network, the apparatus comprising a processor which receives from a first device a telephone number portion identifying a second device, and which converts the telephone number portion into a static multiple level domain name identifying the second device on the network.
11. The apparatus as set forth in claim 10, where the processor further establishes communication with the second device over the network.
12. The apparatus as set forth m claim 10, further comprising a table which matches the static multiple level domain name to an IP address.
13. The apparatus as set forth m claim 10, where the processor further adds domain separators to the received telephone number portion at determmable locations to result in the static multiple level domain name.
14. The apparatus as set forth in claim 10, where the received telephone number portion comprises a separator, and where the processor parses the received telephone number 


portion for the separator and inserts a domain separator for selected instances of the parsed separator.
