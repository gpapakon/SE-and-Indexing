<ABSTRACT>
A generally thin, flexible sanitary napkin capable of absorbing medium to high menstrual flows, and having a stiffened center is provided. In one embodiment, the sanitary napkin has a longitudinal central region disposed along the length of at least a portion of the longitudinal centerline, and longitudinal side regions are disposed outboard of the longitudinal central region. The longitudinal central region of the sanitary napkin has a flexure-resistance that is greater than that of the longitudinal side regions. The embodiment of the sanitary napkin described above easily forms around the curvature of the wearer's labia majora by cupping and surrounding the exterior of the labia majora. The longitudinal central region of the sanitary napkin forms the bottom of a cup-like trough under the wearer's labia majora, and the longitudinal side regions are sufficently flexible that they are able to form the sides of the trough structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles, such as
sanitary napkins. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a generally thin, flexible sanitary napkin that is
provided with a stiffened center.This invention is concerned with absorbent articles such as
sanitary napkins, pantiliners, and incontinent pads that are
designed to absorb and retain liquid and other discharges from the
human body and to prevent body and clothing soiling. The present
invention is particularly concerned with sanitary napkins that are
generally relatively thin and flexible.Sanitary napkins of a wide variety of shapes and dimensions
are currently used by women for the collection of menses and other
bodily discharges.With respect to sanitary napkins, at least two general
classes pertinent to the present invention exist. One such class
is for the absorption of medium to high menstrual flows. These
sanitary napkins offer a fairly high absorptive capacity.
Absorptive capacity is commonly achieved by providing the napkin
with a fairly thick and bulky absorbent member, commonly fluff
pulp. Sanitary napkins of this class are disclosed in U.S. Patent 
3,294,091 which issued to Morse on December 27, 1966 and U.S.
Patent 4,654,040 which patent issued to Luceri on March 31, 1987.Such sanitary napkins theoretically have a high absorptive
capacity, however, when the sanitary napkin is worn and subjected
to the compressive forces of the wearer's thighs and pudendal
region, the fluff pulp core simply compacts or bunches into an
arbitrary, but generally rope-like shape. Such napkins commonly
shift from their original placement so that after only a short
wearing time, the napkin might only partially, if at all, be
beneath the wearer's vaginal orifice or vestibule. Thus, in use,
these sanitary napkins sometimes offer very little absorption.
Further, the rolling and twisting of these napkins may create
soiling on the wearer's panties and skin surfaces. In addition,
the bulkiness of these napkins causes a high degree of wearing
awareness and may make them quite obtrusive when worn with tight
fitting slacks, body suits or bathing suits.A second class of sanitary napkins are intended for light or
low menstrual flows and are commonly referred to as panty liners
or panty shields. Sanitary napkins of this type are disclosed in
U.S. Patent 4,681,578, entitled "Pantiliner With Ventilation
Areas", which patent issued to Anderson and Brandt on July 21,
1987. Sanitary napkins of this class, as a group, are thinner,
somewhat more flexible
