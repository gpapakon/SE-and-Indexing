<ABSTRACT>
An optical scanner for use with laser printers and the 
like. In the optical scanner, a semiconductor laser device is 

combined with an aperture and a collimator lens which is one 
single spherical planoconvex lens for collimating the emerging 

laser beam, the aperture and the collimator lens being arranged 
in that order on the side of the laser device from which the 

laser beam issues. The planar side of the collimator lens is 
directed towards the semiconductor laser device. The 

collimated laser beam is focused by a cylindrical lens to form 
a line image elongated in the main scanning direction. A 

polygonal mirror for deflecting the incident laser beam at a 
substantially uniform angular velocity in the main scanning 

direction is positioned in such a way that a reflecting surface 
of the mirror coincides with the position where the line image 

forms or with a nearby area. The beam reflected from the 
polygonal mirror is launched into an fϑ lens, which converges 

it in such a way that a beam spot is scanned at a substantially 
uniform speed over the surface of a photoreceptor drum. For an 

installation-related reason, a reflector mirror is also 
provided between the fϑ lens and the photoreceptor drum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical scanner for
use with laser printers and the like. More particularly, the
invention relates to an optical scanner using lens optics for
collimating the light from a light emitting source.Optical scanners are extensively used with optical
printers, digital copiers and the like. The basic components
of such optical sensors are: a light emitting source such as a
semiconductor laser device; collimator lens optics with which
the light beam issuing from the semiconductor laser device is
collimated to parallel rays; cylindrical lens optics including
a semi-cylindrical or cylindrical lens having different lens
powers in sagittal and meridional directions; a deflector such
as a polygonal mirror for deflecting the incident light in a
direction corresponding to the main scanning direction; and an
f lens as a scanning lens. The f lens has two functions, one
for converging the deflected laser beam as a spot on a scanning
surface such as a photoreceptor drum or belt, and one for
moving the beam spot over the scanning surface at a
substantially uniform speed.Scanners of this kind are known from US 5,245,481 and EP 0,476,698. As is well known, the light issued from semiconductor
laser devices is divergent and, hence, in order to assure easy
handling, the laser beam is often utilized after conversion to
parallel rays by collimation with collimator lens optics.Collimator lens optics are available in various types,
such as a light source unit that performs collimation using a
combined lens consisting of two or more spherical lens elements
(see Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Sho. 58-140713)
and a light source unit that performs collimation using only
one single aspheric lens element (see Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication No. Hei. 3-249720).However, comprising collimator lens optics of two or
more spherical lens elements has the disadvantage of the need
to use an increased number of components. This results not
only in complicated procedures of assembling, adjusting and
other operations but also in a higher cost. If collimator lens
optics is composed of one single aspheric lens element, the
procedures of assembling, adjusting and other operations can be
simplified but, on the other hand, aspheric lenses cannot be
manufactured as easily and precisely as in the case of
manufacturing spherical lenses by polishing or other mechanical
methods; the method commonly used today is by molding glass but
producing highly precise aspheric lenses consistently at low
cost is
