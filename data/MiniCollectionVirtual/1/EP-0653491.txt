<ABSTRACT>
A process for introducing foreign DNA into cells readily without fail, which comprises combining a foreign DNA to be introduced 
into cells with a compound which can combine with double-stranded DNA and exposing cells to a suspension or solution 

of the resultant complex to thereby incorporate the DNA into the cells efficiently and transform the cells readily without fail.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of introducing a 
foreign DNA into a cell using a compound capable of binding to a 
double-stranded DNA. Specifically, the invention relates to a 
method of obtaining a transformant, a cell transformed with a 
foreign DNA, by binding the foreign DNA to the compound to form 
a DNA:compound complex and then exposing a mammalian cell to a 
suspension or a solution containing the DNA:compound complex. Numerous attempts have been made to express a foreign 
DNA in a host cell by introducing the DNA into the cell of higher 
organisms, especially animal cells. Indeed, various methods of 
obtaining a transformant, a cell containing a foreign DNA, have 
been proposed. For example, such methods include a calcium 
phosphate method (Graham, F.L. and Van Der Eb.,A.J., 1973, 
Virology 52:456-467), a DEAE dextran method (Farber, F.,et. 
al.,1975, Biochem. Biophys.Acta., 390:298-311; Pagano, J.S., 1970, 
Prog.Med.Virol. 12:1-48), a polyornithine method (Farber, F., 
et.al.,1975, Biochem. Biophys.Acta., 390:298-311), a DNA 
microinjection method (Cappechi, M.R., 1980, Cell. 22:479-488), a 
polyethylene glycol (PEG)/dimethylsulfoxide(DMSO) method 
(Jonak, Z.L., et.al., 1984, Hybridoma 3:107-118), a trypsin/EDTA/glycerol 
(Chu, G.J. and Sharp, P.A., 1981, Gene 13:197-202), an 
osmotic shock method (Okada, G.Y., and Rechsteiner, M., 1982, Cell 
29: 33-41), a liposome fusion method (Poste, G., et. al., 1976, 
Methods. Cell. Biol., 14:33-71; Fraley, R. et.al., 1980, J. Biol.  
 
Chem. 255; 10431-10435; Wong, T.K., et.al., 1980, Gene 10;87-94), 
a ghost red cell mediated method (Furusawa, M.,et.al., 1976, 
Methods. Cell. Biol.,14: 73-80; Straus, S. and Raskas, H., 1980, J. 
Gen. Virol. 48: 241-245; Godfrey, W., et.al., 1983, Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80; 2267-2271), a bacterial protoplast fusion 
method (Chu, G.J. and Sharp, P.A., 1981, Gene 13:197-202; 
Sandri-Goldin, R.M., et.al., 1981, Mol. Cell. Biol. 1:743-752; Oi, 
V.T., and Morrison, S.L., 1986, Biotechniques 4: 214-221), a 
reconstituted Sendai virus envelope method (Loyter, A.,et. al., 1984, 
Ciba. Found. Symp., 103:163-180), laser-beamporation (Tsuka 
koshi, M., et.al., 1984, Appl. Phys. B., 35: 2284-2289; Tao, W., 
et.al., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 84: 4180-4184), a 
electroporation method (Neumann, E., et. al., 1982; EMBO. J., 
1:841-845; Potter, H., et.al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 81: 
7161-7165), a tungsten microprojectile method (Klein, T.M., et. al., 
1987, Nature 327: 70-73), a retrovirus
