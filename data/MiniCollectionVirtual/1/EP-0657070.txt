<DESCRIPTION>
 DEPOLARIZED SOLID-STATE DIODE-PIJMPED LASERTechnical FieldThis invention relates to the general subject of lasers and, in particular to diode-pumped, solid-state lasers and methods for producing a depolarized output.Background of the InventionFiberoptic sensors using Mach-Zehnder modulators often require a stable, polarized optical carrier at the output end of a long length of variable birefringence optical fiber. This occurs in coherent communications and in fiber sensors to avoid input lead polarization noise and polarization fading. In general, three approaches have been employed to solve this problem: using polarization preserving fiber; active polarization control with a birefringence device which produces the desired state at the output in conjunction with a feedback loop; and using depolarized light which will always remain depolarized independent of fiber birefringence. (See A.D. Kersey, et al., Electron Lett.. 23; p. 634 and p. 924; 1987).The second method is illustrated by the system developed by Marshall, at EG&G Energy Measurements. That system uses discrete retardation plates located in front of the laser. A computer monitors the feedback signal and uses stepper motor rotation stages to adjust the launch polarization state.The third approach has the advantage of avoiding expensive polarization preserving fiber and does not require complex electronic feedback control loops. One convenient way of achieving this is by combining a depolarized optical source with a polarizer at the modulator 

input. This approach has been demonstrated using two polarization- coupled, frequency-offset, single-frequency lasers as a source. (See W.R. Burns, R.P. Moeller, CH. Buhner and A.S. Greenblatt, "Depolarized source for fiber-optic applications"; Opt. Lett.. 16(6), 381 (1991) and B. Marshall "Polarization Control Systems" Proceedings PSAA-91. pp. 83 (1991)).In particular, the system of Burns et al. used ring cavity, diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers which have precise narrow linewidths that can be thermally tuned. These lasers are normally linearly polarized. The depolarized source was simply created by combining the beams from two lasers whose linear polarization states are at 90Â° to each other, and adjusting the thermal controllers so that the frequency difference between the two sources is at some large frequency, compared to the detection bandwidth of the system of interest. All of these methods are relatively complicated, and in many applications a simpler, single-laser, depolarized source would be
