<ABSTRACT>
By mixing a high-melting polyvinyl alcohol type 
polymer (A) and a low-melting water-soluble polymer (B) 

in a solvent for the polymer (A) to prepare a spinning 
solution and then subjecting the solution to low-temperature 

spinning so that the resulting filaments are solidified 
uniformly in the cross-sectional direction, there is 

formed a fiber of sea-islands structure comprising said 
high-melting polyvinyl alcohol type polymer (A) as the 

sea component and said low-melting water-soluble polymer 
(B) as the islands component. In this fiber, at least 

part of the islands component is present in a fiber zone 
ranging from the fiber surface to 2 µm inside and the 

fiber surface contains substantially no islands component. 
This fiber ordinarily shows the performance of the 

matrix phase, i.e. the performance of a high-melting 
polyvinyl alcohol fiber; however, when the fiber is 

pressurized at high temperatures, the low-melting polymer 
(the islands component) is pushed out onto the fiber 

surface and there occurs heat bonding between fibers. 
Owing to this property of the fiber, a nonwoven fabric 

can be produced advantageously from the fiber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water-soluble
heat-press-bonding polyvinyl alcohol type (hereinafter
referred to simply as PVA type) binder fiber.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a PVA
type binder fiber which is heat-press-bondable, small in
dimensional change of fiber during heat-press bonding,
and water-soluble even after heat-press bonding; a process
for production of said fiber; and a nonwoven fabric
using said fiber.Heat-bonding binder fibers made from, for
example, a melt-spinnable polyethylene or polyester are
on the market. Recently, a sheath-core bicomponent type
heat-bonding binder fiber comprising a high-melting
-point (hereinafter referred to simply as high-melting)
polymer as the core and a low-melting-point (hereinafter
referred to simply as low-melting) polymer as the sheath
has been developed, and this has made it possible to
suppress the shrinkage of fiber during heat bonding. The
sheath-core bicomponent type heat-bonding binder fiber is
finding wider applications owing to its merits such as
easy and speedy bonding operation, and no public hazard.These heat-bonding binder fibers, however, are
each made from a hydrophobic resin and therefore have low
bondability to hydrophilic resins such as PVA type resin, and
cellulose type resin. Further, these heat-bonding
binder fibers are not water-soluble, of course.In producing a water-soluble nonwoven fabric,
there has been used a process which comprises imparting
an aqueous solution of a water-soluble resin of PVA type
to a web of a water-soluble fiber of PVA type and then 
drying the resulting web at low temperatures for a long
time to give rise to fixing between fibers. For example,
in producing a chemical lace base fabric which must be
water-soluble, there is generally used a process which
comprises coating or impregnating a dry laid nonwoven
fabric made from a water-soluble PVA fiber, with an
aqueous solution of a PVA type resin and then drying the
resulting fabric. In such a process of imparting an
aqueous solution and then drying the resulting material,
however, the water-soluble fibers of the base fabric
cause swelling because of the imparting of an aqueous
solution thereto and, when the drying temperature is
high, dissolve in the aqueous solution, which causes the
deformation of nonwoven fabric; therefore, the drying
must be conducted at low temperatures, which requires a
long drying time and results in low productivity. Incidentally,
the above-mentioned "chemical lace base fabric"
is a water-soluble fabric or
