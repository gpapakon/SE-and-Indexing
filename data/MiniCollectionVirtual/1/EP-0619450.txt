<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas distribution equipment and methods, and 
particularly to an apparatus and method for supplying process gas used in 
semiconductor manufacturing. In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, gas cabinets are used to supply 
high purity process gases used in production. An example of such a process 
gas is silane, which is used at the processing location, also known as the tool 
location, in processes such as sputtering and sputter etching. US Patent Specifications No. 4,989,160, and No. 5,220,517 (whose disclosures 
are incorporated herein by reference) disclose automated gas cabinets used for 
supplying process gas in semiconductor manufacturing operations. As noted 
therein, many process gases used in semiconductor manufacturing are highly 
toxic, so that safe control of the gases is imperative. At the same time, the 
delicate nature of semiconductor manufacturing requires that the process gases 
be delivered to the tool location with an absolute minimum of contaminants. In order to permit process gas cylinder changes or other manual activities 
required in operation of a gas cabinet, purge operations like those disclosed in 
the above referenced patent are carried out in order to prevent exposure of the 
operator to the toxic process gas. Purge operations are also intended to flush 
contaminants out of the system of gas carrying conduits, known as a manifold, 
which is associated with the gas cabinet. As the field of semiconductor 
manufacture has advanced, the desired density of components in the resulting 
product has increased and the tolerance for contaminants has decreased. This 
has led designers of gas cabinet and their associated manifolds to seek to 
eliminate "dead-legs" in the manifolds, since dead-legs are considered to be 
sources of contaminants. As is known to those skilled in the art, a "dead-leg" is  
 
a section of conduit through which gas does not flow, ie, the equivalent of a 
cul-de-sac or dead end road. Attempts have been made in the past to provide a gas cabinet manifold that is 
free of dead-legs, but those attempts have not been entirely successful. To 
illustrate this point, reference will be made to Figures 1 and 2, which show prior 
art arrangements of gas cabinet manifolds. In Figure 1, reference numeral 10 generally indicates a gas cabinet manifold in 
accordance with the prior art. The manifold 10 includes a process gas cylinder 
12 with an associated cylinder valve 14, a high pressure isolation (HPI) valve 
16, a high pressure purge (HPP)
