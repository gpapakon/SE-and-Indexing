<ABSTRACT>
Time switch, having a time-of-day display device (DA) for minutes and hours and, if required, days of the week, and having an electronic clock control circuit (CLC) with programme selectors (SOO-SMN), which are arranged in a manner continuously assigned to successive time intervals and can be brought mechanically into an on position and an off position and the programme selector of which (SOO-SMN) corresponding to the respectively current time displayed in the display device (DA) indirectly controls an output switch (AS). The clock control circuit (CLC) emits interrogation signals (AO-AM), which are individually assigned to the time intervals and of which at least one is fed to the programme selectors (SOO-SMN), which are respectively connected, combined via a space multiplex and/or time multiplex circuit, to at least one input (EO-EN) on the clock control circuit (CLC), which controls the output switch (AS) in accordance with the switch position respectively thus determined and in a manner assigned to the actual time interval. An alternative as a defrosting control clock is represented.
