<ABSTRACT>
A method and means for "piggy backing" a FAX 
transmission on a video call. A document, in the form of 

modulated facsimile data, is received from a machine 
located in proximity of a sending station. The document 

is demodulated, packetized and a header, indicating that 
the packet contains facsimile data, is added. The 

packets are then injected into a digital video stream 
carrying video conference data bound for the receiving 

station.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video conferencing. A popular way of exchanging documents between 
locations during a video conference meeting is by using a 
FAX machine at both meeting locations and making a 
separate call each time a document is to be sent from one 
location to the other. A diagram of this technique is 
shown in FIG. 1. In the system of FIG. 1, a fax machine 102a is 
connected to a private branch exchange (PBX) 104a, 
located at a first video conference site, by way of an 
analog telephone line 106a. A video conferencing system 
(VCS) 108a is connected to the PBX 104a by way of an ISDN 
digital telephone line 110a. The PBX 104a is connected 
to the public telephone network 112 by way of an analog 
trunk 114a and ISDN channels 116a. A second video 
conference site is similarly configured with a PBX 104b 
connected to the public telephone network 112 by way of 
an analog trunk 114b and ISDN channels 116b, a FAX 
machine 102b connected to the PBX 104b by way of an 
analog telephone line 106b and a video conferencing 
system 108b connected to the PBX 104b by way of an ISDN 
line 110b. When a conference participant at the first video 
conference site wants to send a FAX to a participant at 
the second video conference site, the sending participant 
places the document into the FAX machine 102a at the 
first site, dials the telephone number of the FAX machine  
 
102b at the second site and sends the FAX in a 
conventional manner. Even though this is a relatively straightforward 
procedure, there are several significant drawbacks. For 
example, some disruption to the conference may occur if 
one of the participants must prepare the FAX machine to 
send the FAX. In particular, time can be wasted in 
determining the appropriate FAX number and then placing 
the call. This may be particularly true when the FAX 
call is an international call. Another drawback is that 
the additional calls (to connect with the FAX machine can 
add to the cost of the video conference. An alternative method of sharing documents is to place 
the document within the field of view of a camera ("in 
camera"). In such systems, a separate document camera 
can be used to produce a video image of the document to 
be discussed. This "document camera" method of sharing 
documents allows the remote end to see, but not handle, 
the document. The remote user cannot mark on the 
document and send it back. Also, while the document is 
being transmitted to the far end, the image of the 
participants cannot be transmitted to the far end

<CLAIMS>
A method of sending a facsimile document from a 
sending station to a receiving station, comprising the 

steps of: 
   receiving modulated facsimile data, from a first 

facsimile machine physically located in proximity of the 
sending station, on a first telephony line at the sending 

station, the modulated facsimile data being generated by 
the first facsimile machine from a document to be imaged; 

   demodulating the facsimile data so as to form 
digital facsimile data; 

   formatting the digital facsimile data into packets; 
and, 

   injecting the packets of digital facsimile data into 
a digital video stream carrying video conference data 

bound for the receiving station. 
The method of Claim 1 comprising the further step of 
displaying the document on a video conference screen at 

the receiving station. 
The method of Claim 1 comprising the further step of 
adding a header to the packets, indicative that the 

packets contain the formatted facsimile data. 
The method of Claim 3 comprising the further steps 
of receiving the packets at the receiving station; 

remodulating, as analog facsimile data, only the data in 
the packets containing the header, and, sending the 

remodulated data to a second facsimile machine located in 
proximity to the receiving station. 
An apparatus for handling facsimile documents during 
a video conference, comprising: 

   VCS interface means for interfacing with data and 
control lines of a video conferencing system;

 
   communication means for transmitting facsimile 

formatted data to a FAX machine; 
   header injection means, connected to receive digital 

facsimile data from the communication means and to send a 
first digital data stream to the VCS interface means, for 

adding a header to the facsimile data, identifying the 
facsimile data as facsimile information; and, 

   FAX data detector means, connected to receive a 
second data stream from the VCS interface means and to 

send digital facsimile data to the communication means, 
for detecting data having the header in the second data 

stream, for stripping the header from the data, and for 
forwarding the data to the communication means; 

   wherein the facsimile data having the header is 
transmitted over a common data link with a video 

conference being transacted by way of the video 
conferencing system. 
The apparatus of Claim 5 wherein the communication 
means includes an asynchronous transmitter coupled to the 

FAX machine. 
The apparatus of Claim 5 wherein the communication 
means includes a FAX modem. 
The apparatus of Claim 7 further comprising link 
interface means, coupled to the FAX modem, for 

interfacing with a telephony communication line.
