<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for fastening an object on a wall (17) or the like which exhibits a bore (18). The device comprises a nut (1) which is intended for plugging through the bore (18) and for arranging on the rearside of the wall (17) and which has a threaded bore, a width which projects beyond the diameter thereof only to a small extent and a length which projects beyond the bore diameter by a multiple, and further comprises a retaining element (8) connected to the nut (1) and serving for mounting purposes, a bolt with a threaded portion which can be screwed into the threaded bore of the nut (1), and a means which is intended for arranging on the front side of the wall (17) and is intended for bracing the wall (17) between said means and the nut (1). The height of the nut (1) is greatest in the region of the threaded bore and decreases gradually from there to the longitudinal borders of the nut. The bracing means is supported on the bolt.
