<ABSTRACT>
Electrolytes are attached to fluorescent particle 
surfaces to prevent open spots in cathode-ray tube coatings 

dried at high temperatures. Electrolytes that are sulfates, 
nitrates, or chlorides of alkali or alkaline-earth metals are 

added to a liquid suspension of fluorescent particles which 
have passed through a cleaning step. Electrolytes are added 

to the suspension to make the conductivity of the clear top 
liquid greater than 30 µ Ω ⁻¹cm⁻¹. The fluorescent particle 

preparation process is finished with a final dehydration and 
drying step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT) 
fluorescent material and its method of manufacture 
wherein the surface properties of the fluorescent 
material are modified, while maintaining fluorescent 
functionality, to allow uniform fluorescent material film 
formation during CRT face-plate coating. Various coating methods have been developed for 
forming a fluorescent material coating on the face-plate 
of a color CRT. Among them, the slurry method is the most 
often used. In the slurry method, a face-plate is coated 
with a fluorescent film as follows. Ammonium dichromate 
(ADC) or like substance is added to an aqueous solution 
of fluorescent material particles and polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA) to make a fluorescent material suspension (slurry). 
The inner surface of the face-plate is coated with this 
fluorescent material suspension. The coated surface is 
then exposed to ultra-violet light through a shadow-mask 
causing the exposed areas to oxidize and harden. Since 
the unexposed fluorescent material particles do not 
react, they are sprayed off with water to develop the 
surface. In this fashion a prescribed fluorescent pattern 
is formed on the face-plate. In the slurry method, the entire panel including the 
face-plate was traditionally heated to about 38°C to 40 
°C. Recently, in order to increase production by reducing 
drying time after exposure and development, it has become 
common to dry the panel including the face-plate by 
heating it to the high temperature of 55°C to 60°C during 
the drying step. However, by drying the fluorescent coating at these 
high temperatures, local thinning of the fluorescent 
material and open spots occur more frequently in the 
coating resulting in a reduction in production yield. 
Therefore, fluorescent material particles with modified  
 
surfaces, that allow a uniform fluorescent coating to be 
formed without open spots even when the panel is dried at 
the high temperature of 55°C to 60°C and maintain 
fluorescent functionality, have long been sought. The present inventor discovered that the above 
mentioned problems could be solved by attaching large 
quantities of electrolytes, which are sulphates, 
nitrates, or chlorides of alkali metals or nitrates or 
chlorides of alkaline-earth metals, to the fluorescent 
particles, rather than by methods of forming a 
fluorescent coating such as adding small amounts of 
aqueous zinc sulphate solution to the fluorescent 
material slurry in the slurry method disclosed, for 
example, in Japanese Non-examined Patent
