<ABSTRACT>
A radial piston pump of the type, in which an excentric rotor (7) is 
adapted to cause the pistons (4) to perform a reciprocating movement 

within radial cylinders (3) in the pump body (1), the radial inner ends 
of the 

pistons (4) being each provided with a broadened foot (6), said 
broadened feet (6) 

being kept in contact with the rotor (7) also during the suction strokes 
of the respective pistons (4) by means of a coupling ring (26) of a 

substantially 
L-shaped cross-section, the axial ring portion (26a) of which 

engages the radial outer end faces of the broadened feet and the 
radial portion (26b) of which keeps said ring (26) axially in place. 

According to 
the invention the coupling ring (26) has its radial portion (26b) bearing 

loosely 
against a radial sliding surface, while the broadened feet (6) at the 

radial inner piston ends are in the shape of heads which are 
integrally formed with the respective pistons (4), the free end faces of 

said heads, as well as the end faces adjoining the respective pistons (4) 
beig spherically shaped, the axial portion of the coupling (26) having an 

inner circumferential surface of a slightly conically widening shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radial piston pump of the type in 
which an excentric rotor is adapted to cause the pistons to perform a 
reciprocating movement within radial cylinders in the pump body, the 
radial inner ends of the pistons being each provided with a broadened 
foot, said broadened feet being kept in contact with the rotor also 
during the suction strokes of the respective pistons by means of a 
coupling ring of a substantially L-shaped cross-section, the axial 
ring portion of which engages the radial outer end faces of the 
broadened feet and the radial portion of which keeps said ring axially 
in place. Such a pump is known from German Offenlegungsschrift 1.928.853. With this well-known pump the broadened feet at the radial inner 
piston ends are formed by sliding shoes which are pivotally connected 
to the respective piston ends. The effective sliding surfaces of said 
sliding shoes are shaped to conform with the cylindrical surface of 
the rotor and the cylindrical inner circumferential surface of the 
axial ring portion of the coupling ring respectively. The coupling 
ring has its radial portion fixedly connected to the rotor. The 
sliding shoes, which are stationary as seen in the direction of 
rotation, are thus slidingly guided with an inner and an outer 
cylindrical sliding surface between two concentric cylindrical surface 
portions of the rotor and of the coupling ring respectively. This 
means, that a considerable frictional resistance has to be overcome, 
said frictional resistance being further increased by the friction in 
the pivot connection between the pistons and the sliding shoes. The invention therefore aims at providing a pump of the above 
type, with which the frictional resistance to be overcome in 
operation, is substantially reduced. According to the invention this aim is achieved in that the 
coupling ring has its radial portion bearing loosely against a radial 
sliding surface, which the broadened feet at the radial inner piston 
ends are in the shape of heads which are integrally formed with the 
respective pistons, the free end faces of said heads, as well as the 
end faces adjoining the respective pistons beig spherically shaped, 
the axial portion of the coupling having an inner circumferential 
surface of a slightly conically widening shape. Due to the measures according to the invention the areas of 
contact between the mutual sliding surfaces of the pistons, the  
 
coupling ring and the rotor are substantially reduced to point and 
line contacts, whereas
