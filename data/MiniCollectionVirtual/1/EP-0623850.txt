<ABSTRACT>
A photographic filmstrip (26) is initially coiled about 
a spool inside a supply cartridge (24) such that a core set 

is imparted to the filmstrip causing the filmstrip to 
curl in a longitudinal direction when not constrained. A 

leading end of the filmstrip is passed adjacent 
constraining means (43) after the leading end of the film 

exits a film processor (22). The leading end of the filmstrip 
is contacted against the constraining means (43) such that, 

as the filmstrip continues to exit the film processor (22), 
the filmstrip coils up against the constraining means (43) to 

prevent the filmstrip from curling back against the exit 
aperture from the film processor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
photography, and more particularly to photofinishing 
equipment. Specifically, the invention relates to a 
method and apparatus for handling a photographic 
filmstrip as the filmstrip exits a film processor. When photographic film is stored on a small core 
for extended periods of time and/or at elevated 
temperatures, the film takes on a core set. Core set of 
the film causes the film to curl in a longitudinal 
direction when the film is removed from the core and is 
unconstrained. With conventional films that include a cellulose 
triacetate (CT) base, most of the core set imparted to 
the film is removed during processing of the film. The 
core set is removed because the film emulsion and base 
both absorb significant amounts of water when exposed to 
water-based solutions during processing. As a result, 
the processed film typically exits a film processor in 
long strips which are not curled. These strips fall into 
a receptacle and then are manually carried to a 
photographic printer where prints of the images on the 
film are made. Other types of films, such as those which include a 
polyethylene terepthalate (PET) or polyethylene 
napthalate (PEN) base, lose very little core set during 
processing. This is due to the fact that these types of 
film bases absorb very little water during processing in 
water based solutions. Consequently, as this type of 
film exits the film processor, the film tends to curl 
back up on itself. With CT based films, as stated above, the film 
exits the processor in a long strip. The images  
 
on the film are not protected in any way and can be 
damaged as the film falls from the film processor into a 
receptacle. The images may be further damaged by an 
operator during handling of the film and loading of the 
film into a photographic printer. For example, 
fingerprints and/or scratches may be imparted to the 
film during handling by the operator. With films having a base made of a water-phobic 
material, such as PET or PEN, once a leader card has 
been removed from a lead end of the film, the film curls 
up against where the film exited the film processor. The 
curled up film can become entangled at the processor 
exit, for example, becoming wrapped around a pinch 
roller, causing damage to the film According to one aspect of the invention, a 
photographic filmstrip is initially coiled about a spool 
inside a supply cartridge such that a core set is 
imparted to the filmstrip causing the filmstrip to curl

comprising the steps of: 
   passing a leading end of said filmstrip adjacent 

constraining means after said leading end exits said 
film processor; and 

   contacting said leading end of said filmstrip 
against sai

filmstrip continues to exit said film processor, said 

filmstrip coils up against said constraining means to 
prevent said filmstrip from curling back against where 

it exits from said film processor. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said contacting 
step includes the step of: 

   releasing a leader card from said leading end of 
said filmstrip to allow said leading end to contact said 

constraining means. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the 
step of: 

   catching a coiled up filmstrip in a receptacle 
after a trail end of said filmstrip has exited said film 

processor. 
Apparatus for handling a photographic 
filmstrip as the filmstrip exits a film processor, 

wherein said filmstrip is initially coiled about a spool 
inside a supply cartridge such that a core set is 

 
imparted to the filmstrip causing the filmstrip to curl 

in a longitudinal direction when not constrained, said 
apparatus comprising: 

   constraining means for preventing the filmstrip 
from curling back against an exit aperture of said film
