<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing an antistatic coating 
which consists of more than one layer on a display screen and which comprises at least 
one antistatic layer. The invention also relates to a display screen having an antistatic coating. Antistatic coatings are used on display screens of display devices, in 
particular CRTs. Said coatings are sufficiently electroconductive to ensure that a high 
electrostatic voltage present on the outside surface of the display screen is removed 
within a few seconds. Thus, the user does not experience an unpleasant shock if he 
touches the screen. Besides, the attraction of atmospheric dust is reduced. One of the layers of the coating is an antistatic layer comprising an 
electroconductive compound. Known coatings comprise, in addition to said antistatic 
layer, layers having, for example, an antireflective or antiglare effect or a layer which 
improves the scratch resistance. Usually said other layers are provided by spinning or 
spraying of a silica layer. A method of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is known from 
"Japan Display '92, pp. 289-292: "Anti-glare, Anti-reflection and antistatic (AGRAS) 
Coating for CRTs"", by H. Tohda et.al. In said document a method is described in 
which a display screen is provided with a conductive (antistatic) SnO layer by means of 
CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition), whereafter a central and outermost SiO2 layer are 
provided by, respectively, spinning, spraying and a thermal treatment. This method is very laborious and time consuming; the CVD process is 
carried out in a separate reaction space. After the SnO layer is provided the surface is 
treated by means of polishing and cleaning. It is an object of the invention to provide a simple method of  
 
manufacturing multilayer antistatic coatings. In accordance with the invention, the object of providing a simple method of 
manufacturing a multilayer antistatic coating is achieved in that a first layer of 
conductive particles is provided, whereafter on said first 
layer a second layer of a compound is provided and said 
compound penetrates into the first layer, after which said 
compound is subjected to a treatment at an increased 
temperature to form an adhering network on said display 
screen on basis of conversion of said compound of said second 
layer, whereby an antistatic coating is formed comprising a 
first, antistatic layer comprising conductive particles and 
converted compound and, on said first, antistatic layer, a 
second layer
