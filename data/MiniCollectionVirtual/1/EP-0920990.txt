<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composite olefin resin
laminated sheet excellent in thermoformability and rigidity. More
particularly, it relates to a composite resin laminated sheet
suitable for thermoforming to produce containers or covers used for
food packaging.An olefin resin sheet is excellent in heat resistance, oil
resistance and the like and has been used for forming (vacuum forming,
pressure forming, etc.) to produce formings, such as various
containers, cups, trays, etc.However, having sharper melt properties than other resins
such as polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride, an olefin resin sheet
considerably sags when preheated for thermoforming, such as vacuum
forming, so that the resulting formings are apt to suffer from
forming defects, such as wrinkles, thickness variation, or holes.It is known that the sag of an olefin resin sheet in
thermoforming can be reduced by using a polyblend of a polypropylene
resin and a polyethylene resin, which is commonly practiced (see
JP-A-52-136247 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application"), JP-A-55-108433 and J-B-63-30951
(the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined 
Japanese patent publication")); adding bismaleimide to a polyolefin
(see JP-A-3-52493); using a composition comprising polypropylene,
an inorganic filler, and a maleic anhydride-modified or silane-modified
polyolefin (see JP-A-51-69553 and JP-A-52-15542); or
adding fibrous polytetrafluoroethylene to a polyolefin (see JP-A-8-165358).In recent years the proportion of a recycled material in
a molding material tends to increase, climbing to about 30 to 50%
by weight in a polyolefin molding material. An olefin resin sheet
molded from such a molding material with a width as large as about
900 mm or more is liable to sag particularly appreciably. In
particular where a sheet is formed into thermoformings of prescribed
shape with high precision, for example, a container with a cover
fitted on that is designed to improve hygiene or handling properties,
it must be heated for at least double the usual time, which further
increases the tendency to sag.Under such circumstances, the above-mentioned
conventional techniques consisting of blending polyethylene,
adding bismaleimide or mixing an inorganic filler and a modified
polyolefin do not achieve sufficient improvement in sag resistance
enough to be effective on wide sheets. The olefin resin sheet
containing fibrous polytetrafluoroethylene is, while transparent,
inferior in rigidity, heat resistance or shrink
