<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with a method for the separation of 
bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from a protein-containing solution wherein 

the LPS are set free into the solution by using at least one suitable solubilizing 
agent, and wherein the solution is brought into contact with a glass surface, 

whereafter the LPS-loaded glass surface is separated from the protein-containing 
solution.

 
Furthermore, LPS from a solution can easily be detected according to the 

present invention by conventional methods, by first binding said LPS to a glass 
surface in the above described way.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a method for the separation of 
bacterial lipopolysaccharides from a protein-containing solution, and with a 
method for the detection of lipopolysaccharides. It is well known that bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), known as 
endotoxins, can cause (severe) pyrogenic reactions upon administration to 
animals and humans. Thus, the LPS-mediated biological effects of shock, fever, 
leucopenia, hyperglycemia, intravascular coagulation and others have been 
recognized. For this reason the occurence of LPS above a certain threshold 
concentration will withhold allowance of pharmaceuticals or biologicals for 
administration to animals and humans. In solution LPS are arranged in a bilayer similar to a bilayer of 
phospholipids. Bivalent cations, e.g. Ca²⁺, stabilize this bilayer. These huge 
bilayer structures can be reduced in size by the use of detergents or bile salts. 
The thus formed mixed micelles of LPS and detergents or bile salts have 
smaller molecular weights which offer an opportunity to separate the micelle-bound 
LPS from product by ultrafiltration or microfiltration methods. Making use of the basic characteristics of bacterial LPS, also several 
other methods have been described claiming removal of LPS from the product 
of interest. Amongst these is the application of organic substances such as 
phenol, trichloroacetic acid, or a phenol/chloroform/petroleum-ether mixture, 
or the neutralization of LPS by endotoxin binding proteins (ENP). This latter 
method is suited for removal at laboratory scale, but gives significant protein 
losses. Furthermore, LPS have been removed by making use of resins, charged 
filters, barium sulfate, detergents and bile acids or derivatives thereof (see e.g. 
U.S. patent 4315919 and Sweadner et al., Appl. and Env. Microbiology 34, 
1977, 382-385), either or not in combination with chelators. Although the above methods have resulted in clearance of LPS from  
 
protein-containing solutions to various extends at a laboratory scale, neither of 
these methods, however, is suited to separate LPS from such solutions in a 
cost effective and efficient manner on a industrial scale. The purpose of the present invention is to provide a simple and reliable 
method for the removal of LPS from a protein-containing solution. This method 
can well be used on an industrial scale. For several purposes there is a need for a diagnostic method for 
quantitative or qualitative determination of bacterial LPS in solution (LAL tests).
