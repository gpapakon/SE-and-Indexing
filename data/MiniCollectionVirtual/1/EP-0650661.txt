<ABSTRACT>
A machine for spreading material, more specifically 
granular and/or pulverulent material such as artificial 

fertilizer, which machine comprises a frame (1), a storage 
bin (2, 75) for the material to be spread and at least one 

spreader member (13, 14, 79, 80). The machine includes a 
measuring device (26, 65, 101) for measuring at least part of 

the material to be spread. The measuring device (26, 65, 101) 
is coupled to an electronic mechanism, which electronic 

mechanism is such that as fixed values can be keyed thereinto 
the spreading width and the desired quantity of material to 

be spread per surface unit, which values can be compared in 
the electronic mechanism with the variable values of the 

measuring device (26, 65, 101) and the rate of operative 
travel of the machine to be keyed thereinto, the arrangement 

being such that the desired quantity of material per surface 
unit is spread by controlling the adjusting member (34) for 

the dosing member (32) by means of the variable values fed 
into the electronic mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a machine for spreading 
material, more specifically granular and/or pulverulent 
material such as artificial fertilizer, which machine 
comprises a frame, a storage bin for the material to be 
spread and at least one spreader member, whereby the machine 
includes a measuring device for measuring at least part of 
the material to be spread. A machine of this kind is known from EP-A 
0 287 165. It is an object of the invention to improve a 
machine of the above-defined type. According to the invention, 
the measuring device is coupled to an electronic 
mechanism, which electronic mechanism is such that as fixed 
values can be keyed thereinto the spreading width and the 
desired quantity of material to be spread per surface unit, 
which values can be compared in the electronic mechanism with 
the variable values of the measuring device and the rate of 
operative travel of the machine to be keyed thereinto, the 
arrangement being such that the desired quantity of material 
per surface unit is spread by controlling the adjusting 
member for the dosing member by means of the variable values 
fed into the electronic mechanism. For a better understanding of the present invention 
and to show how the same may be carried into effect, 
reference will now be made, by way of example, to some embodiments 
of the machine shown in the accompanying drawings, in  
 
which: 
Figure 1 is a rear view of a machine according to 
the invention; Figure 2 is, to an enlarged scale, a cross-sectional 
view taken in the line II - II in Figure 1 of part 
of the machine; Figure 3 is a plan view of part of the machine in 
the direction of the arrow III in Figure 2; Figure 4 is a rear view of a further embodiment of 
the machine according to the invention; Figure 5 is a side view of the machine of Figure 
4, seen in the direction of the arrow V in Figure 4; Figure 6 is a rear view of a still further embodiment 
of the machine according to the invention; Figure 7 is a cross-sectional view of part of the 
machine shown in Figure 6, taken on the line VII - VII in 
Figure 6, and Figure 8 is a plan view of part of the machine 
shown in Figures 6 and 7, seen in the direction of the arrow 
VIII in Figure 7. The embodiment of the machine according to the 
invention as shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3 comprises a frame 1 
having fastened thereto a storage bin 2. The frame 1 includes 
a vertical frame portion 3 having attached thereto coupling 
members 4 for coupling the machine to the lifting hitch of a 
tractor or a
