<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a roller for furnaces, 
particularly for iron and steel making furnaces for 

heating slabs, or the like, this roller being part of a 
sole consisting of a plurality of rollers substantially 

parallel to each other, and being provided with a 
plurality of annular collars (6, 6', 10) (annular riders) 

which are side by side and spaced apart, the rollers (1) 
and the annular collars (6, 6', 10) being cooled with a 

cooling fluid. 
According to the invention, the annular collars 
(annular riders) (6, 6', 10) are cooled by means of a 

flow of cooling fluid which is orientated transversely 
with respect to their axis and parallel to their median 

plane. The annular riders are made in tubular form and 
may be of toroidal form (6, 6') and are connected 

separately each to the supply duct (3) and to the return 
duct (2) for the cooling fluid. They may also be formed 

by the individual turns of a tubular spiral (10) or by a 
number of successive segments of a spiral which are 

connected via their ends to the supply duct (3) and to 
the return duct (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a roller for furnaces, 
particularly for iron and steel making furnaces for heating 
slabs, or the like, this roller being part of a sole 
consisting of a plurality of rollers substantially parallel 
to each other and being provided with a plurality of 
toroidal chambers which are coaxial to the roller and 
distributed along it in spaced apart relationship, each 
toroidal chamber having a polygonal, square or circular 
cross section and being divided by a transverse partition 
while on opposite sides of thi.s partition an inlet and an 
outlet are provided, connected to an inner cooling system of 
the roller in such a manner, that the flow of the cooling 
fluid in each chamber is orientated transversely with 
respect to the axis of the roller and parallel to the median 
plane of the toroidal chambers. A roller of this kind is known from the document 
FR-A-512.892. In this known roller, each toroidal chamber is 
formed in a circular disk integral with two opposed central 
tubular hubs which are coaxial to the roller and communicate 
with the toroidal chamber on opposite sides of its 
transverse partition. The roller is composed of a plurality 
of these disks connected to each other by means of tubular  
 
roller portions screwed into the tubular hubs of the disks. It is an object of the invention to improve a roller of 
the type described initially, in such a way, as to render 
simpler and more economical its construction. The invention resolves the above problem with a roller 
according to the preamble of claim 1, characterized in that 
a) each toroidal chamber is formed by a tubular annular 
collar (6, 64) closed on itself around the roller (1) and 
fixed coaxially to the roller, b) the roller consists of two coaxial tubular 
cilindrical elements which are radially spaced apart forming 
two coaxial chambers, one of which is connected to the 
supply duct of the cooling system, while the other is 
connected to the return duct of the cooling system, c) the chamber of the tubular annular collar is 
connected on one side of its partition to the radially inner 
chamber of the roller by means of a connector tube, which 
passes through the radially outer chamber of the roller. Some further improvements of the roller according to the 
invention form the subject of the dependent claims.  
 The particular characteristics of the invention and 
the advantages derived therefrom will be more clearly 
understood from the description of some preferred 
embodiments, illustrated by way of example
