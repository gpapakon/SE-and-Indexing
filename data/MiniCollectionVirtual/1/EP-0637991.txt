<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of effecting a physico-chemical reaction, in which method a crystalline or amorphous substance is crushed or ground. In the method according to the invention, as soon as a new fractured surface is formed, it is brought into immediate contact with an environment V1 the physico-chemical property of which is so selected that a firm bond or compound is formed between the fractured surface and the molecules of the environment, at least one molecule of said bond or compound being adapted to its purpose for the further treatment of the crushed or ground material in another environment V2, whereby the physico-chemical property of the environment V1 is further so selected that components disadvantageous in view of the further treatment of the crushed or ground material are prevented from getting to the fractured surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of making a composite
material comprising a crystalline or amorphous material and a
matrix material.In almost all materials, the surface is a very
important part of the material. It may even be said that the
rest of the material serves as a mere supporting structure
for the surface. Typical examples are powders and fibres in
which the strength/mass increases continuously as the surface
area of the fibre increases, that is, its diameter decreases.In ceramic and other materials, small grain size is of
the greatest importance, that is, a high surface area/mass
unit.In solid substances, all chemical reactions and
physical adhesions always occur on the surface.Therefore various grinding techniques have been
developed, which aim at increasingly small particle sizes,
that is, greater surface areas/mass unit.Surfaces have a great number of properties all of which
are not necessarily positive or desired simultaneously in
view of the intended use.The most usual formation of coating occurring in
material treatment takes place spontaneously, even in such a
way that it is difficult to prevent. This usually takes
place as molecules present in air, especially oxygen, settle
on a newly formed surface in a layer of a few molecules. In
a way, the surface is contaminated.In this way the special properties of all surfaces
change nearly automatically as they are modified by oxygen
molecules, and the properties of all surfaces approach each
other. This takes place especially in most grinding
operations, which are carried out in the atmosphere according
to a prevailing practice.Contaminations caused by the molecules of air,
"coatings", adhere so firmly to the surfaces that the removal 
of adsorbed air from a surface formed in grinding requires
prolonged bombing with an electron beam even in a vacuum.It is known that newly formed surfaces are more active
for reactions typical of all surfaces than "old surfaces".
This phenomenon can be explained in many ways, which can be
fitted in two main categories.
1) The surface of fracture contains free unterminated
valences;2) A gas layer from the air has not yet settled on the
surface to form "an insulation", contamination.Chemical terminology knows a concept in statu nascendi,
which means "in the state of being born", whereby it is
possible to effect a reaction, adsorption, etc. more rapidly
and efficiently than without this situation. This is the
same phenomenon as represented by the above two categories.The present invention concerns especially

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a composite material comprising a
particulate crystalline or amorphous material and a matrix

material, which comprises crushing or grinding the
crystalline or amorphous material in an environment in which

it is in intimate contact with a liquid that is to provide
the matrix such that, as fractured surfaces of the

crystalline or amorphous material are formed due to the
crushing or grinding, they undergo a physico-chemical

reaction with the liquid matrix material.
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which the liquid
comprises a water-cement paste and the particulate material

comprises stone.
A method as claimed in claim 2, which includes the step
of making cement for the cement paste by grinding cement in a

carbon dioxide atmosphere
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which the liquid
comprises a bitumen material and the particulate material

comprises stone.
A method of forming a composite material comprising a
particulate crystalline or amorphous material, which

comprises:

(a) replacing an atmosphere of air in a grinding or
crushing chamber with an atmosphere of a selected gas

phase material,
(b) crushing or grinding the particulate material in
the said chamber so that, as fractured surfaces of the

particulate material are formed due to the crushing or 
grinding, they undergo a physico-chemical reaction with

the said gas phase material, and
(c) forming a composite material by mixing the
particulate material resulting from the said steps (a)

and (b) with a matrix material, the interactions
between the matrix material and the particulate

material being stronger than interactions between the
matrix material and such particulate material which has

not been exposed to the gas phase material during its
crushing or grinding.

particulate material comprises wollastonite and the gas phase

material comprises styrene.

A method as claimed in claim 5, in which the
particulate material comprises stone and the gas phase

material comprises carbon dioxide. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, in which the
particulate material comprises stone, the gas phase material

comprises carbon dioxide, and the matrix material comprises a
cement-water paste.
