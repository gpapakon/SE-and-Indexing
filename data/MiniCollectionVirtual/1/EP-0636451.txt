<ABSTRACT>
Safety device for a storage rack (1, 7) for tools of a machining centre with at least one tool carrier (20) in the storage rack, at least one transport device (11-17) arranged on one side of the storage rack for removing and inserting a tool (6) from and into the tool carrier and for taking the tool to another storage point of the storage rack or to the machining centre, at least one access opening (19), located on the side of the storage rack opposite the transport device, for exchanging tools, and a movable safety cover (24) which in the one position permits the exchange of tools and blocks the access to these tools for the transport device and in the other position blocks the access for the exchange of tools and permits the access to these tools for the transport device.

<CLAIMS>
A safety device on a shelf magazine for tools of a 
machining centre with at least one tool carrier (20) in 

the shelf magazine (1, 7), at least one transport device 
(11 to 17) disposed on one side of the shelf magazine (1, 

7) for withdrawing and inserting a tool (6) into or from 
the tool carrier (20) and for bringing the tool (6) to 

another storage station in the shelf magazine (1, 7) or 
to the machining centre, and with at least one access 

aperture (19) for the exchange of tools (6) and disposed 
on the side of the shelf magazine (1, 7) which is 

opposite the transport device (11 to 17), characterised 
by a movable safety covering (24) which in one position 

allows the interchange of tools (6) and blocks access to 
these tools (6) for the transport device (11 to 17) and 

which in the other position blocks access to the 
interchange of tools (6) and allows access to these tools 

(6) for the transport device (11 to 17). 
A safety device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the safety covering (24) consists of a door which 

closes in one position of the access aperture (19) on the 
transport device side and in the other position occludes 

the access aperture (19) on the tool exchange side. 
A safety device according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the door (8) is constructed as a single-leaf or two-leaf 

pivotable door.  
 
A safety device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised 
in that an additional removable access aperture 

(22) is disposed on one of the sides of the shelf 
magazine (1, 7) which prevents access in a partially 

opened or closed position of the safety covering (24). 
A safety device according to one or more of claims 1 to 
4, characterised by, connected to a control (23) of the 

transport device (11 to 17), an interlocking means (25) 
on the safety covering (24) which, when released, blocks 

access of the transport device (11 to 17) with the 
exception of the respective tool carrier (20). 
A safety device according to one or more of claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that the safety covering consists of 

at least one roller blind (24) which alternately occludes 
the access aperture (18) for the transport device (11 to 

17) or the access aperture (19) for tool exchange. 
A safety device according to one or more of claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the tool carrier consists of a 

carriage (20) with a plate (21) for receiving at least 
one tool (6). 
A safety device according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the access safeguard consists of a sheet metal 

cladding (22) disposed on the carriage (20) on the side 
of the access aperture (19) for tool exchange. 
A safety device according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the roller blind (24) is adapted for upwards and 

downwards movement.  
 
A safety device according to one or more of claims 7 to 
9, characterised by an interlocking arrangement (26) 

engaging the carriage (20) and separable only when 
there is a completely closed access aperture (18) for 

the transport device (11 to 17). 
A safety device according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the interlocking arrangement (26) is connected to 

the control (23) of the transport device (11 to 17). 
A safety device according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the shelf magazine (1, 7) has a first level plane 

(2) which accommodates a plurality of carriages and, 
disposed above it, further planes (3, 4) with rigidly 

disposed receiving plates (5) for tools (6). 
A safety device according to claim 12, characterised in 
that two shelf magazines (1, 7) are disposed parallel 

with each other and form an alley (8) for the transport 
device (11 to 17).
