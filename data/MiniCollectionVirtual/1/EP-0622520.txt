<ABSTRACT>
An improved sealing assembly which includes an 
improved sealing ring assembly for sealing across the 

annulus between facing sealing surfaces in which the 
sealing ring assembly includes a sealing ring with an 

annular base, a first leg and a second leg extending from 
the edge portions of the base, a plurality of segments 

positioned in the annular space between the first and 
second legs, said segments being sized to substantially 

fill the annular space between the legs and but not to have 
any detrimental hoop stress which would reduce the 

effectiveness to the transmission of loading between the 
legs, means for mounting said sealing ring assembly in the 

annulus and means for loading one of the legs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved annular
seal which has particular application to sealing across
annular spaces between facing cylindrical surfaces, such
as the annular seal between the exterior of a hanger and
the surrounding housing in a well. The prior annular seals
have used annular seals having a U-shaped section with
expander rings positioned in the space between the two legs
of the ring to either mechanically or responsive to
pressure urge the expander ring inwardly of the legs to
wedge them outward into sealing engagement with the facing
cylindrical surfaces to effectively seal across the annulus
between such surfaces.U. S. Patent No. 3,288,472 to B. J. Watkins discloses
a metal seal which includes a U-shaped ring having legs
extending axially away from an annular base and tapering
outwardly at an angle preferred to be approximately 2Â°.
This provides an interference fit for the legs of the seal
ring with respect to the surfaces against which they are to
seal. U. S. Patent Nos. 3,378,269; 4,766,956; and
5,031,923 all disclose similar metal seals which include
annular metal seal rings having a U-shaped section and
having an interference fit with the surfaces against which
they are to seal.U. S. Patent No. 2,075,947 discloses a pipe joint
which includes a soft metal seal ring having a pair of
upwardly extending spaced legs and a pair of downwardly
extending spaced legs with an annular hard metal wedging
member positioned between each pair of legs and energized
by the nut to be forced between the legs to urge the legs
radially into sealing engagement with the outer and inner
annular cylindrical surfaces against which they are to
seal. Other prior art patents disclosing similar 
structures include U. S. Patent Nos. 3,915,462; 4,766,956;
4,900,041; and 5,044,672.U. S. Patent No. 3,326,560 to N. D. Trbgovich
discloses an adjustable annular seal which has a V shape
and includes a split ring expander positioned between the
diverging legs of the seal ring with suitable shoulders
containing and urging the seal ring and expander together
so that the expander urges the legs of the seal ring
radially into sealing engagement with the annular walls
against which it is to seal. The expander is described as
being substantially coextensive in length with the sealing
ring and being resiliently compressible for urging the
walls (legs) apart to compensate for wear of the sealing
portions. It is stated that the expander should be
constrained from moving into engagement with the sealing
surfaces and thus
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An annular sealing ring assembly (10,50,80) for
sealing across the annular space between an external member

(16) having an outer cylindrical surface (34) and an
external member (18) having an inner cylindrical surface

(36), the assembly comprising an annular metal seal ring
(101) having an annular base (102) with a pair of spaced

apart legs (104,106) extending from the annular base
substantially in one direction and including a first leg

and a second leg with an annular space between the legs; a
plurality of segments (108) positioned in the annular space

between the legs, the segments substantially filling the
annular space between the legs; and means (54,56) for

retaining the segments within the annular space between the
legs; characterised in that the segments are arranged to

transfer load between the legs, and the segments are all

sufficiently short whereby they are not subject to hoop
tension.
An assembly (10,50) according to claim 1, wherein the
annular base (102) has a centreline (110), and the legs

(104,106) extend from the edges of the annular base in a
direction generally parallel to the centreline.
An assembly (80) according to claim 1, wherein the
annular base (102) is cylindrical, and the legs extend

generally perpendicularly from the edges of the annular
base.
An assembly according to claim 1, including at least
one groove (136,138) on the interior of the first leg

(104), and at least one groove (148,150) on the exterior of
the second leg (106).
An assembly according to claim 2, wherein the first
leg (106) is positioned to extend slightly radially inward 

at an angle with respect to the annular base centreline
(110) so that it provides an interference fit with the

surface (36) against which it is to seal when it is
installed thereon and so that it urges the segments (108)

radially away from the first leg to move the second leg
(104) radially into sealing engagement with the sealing

surface (34) against which the second leg is to seal.
An assembly, according to claim 1, including a pair of
the seal rings (101) assembled with their open ends in

facing relationship to each other and with the segments
(108) in each ring in engagement with the segments of the

other ring.
An assembly comprising a first sealing ring assembly
and a second sealing ring assembly each according to claim

1, the first sealing ring assembly (100) being positioned
to have its legs (104,106) extending from their base (102)

in a first axial direction, the second sealing ring
assembly (100) having its legs (104,106) extending from

their base (102) in a second axial direction which is
towards the first sealing assembly, and a portion of the

segments (108) in each of the sealing assemblies abutting
the same portion of the segments of the other sealing

assembly so that force on the sealing assemblies urges them
toward each other and also urges their segments into the

annular spaces between their legs.
An assembly according to claim 7, wherein the sealing
ring assemblies (100) are positioned within a well and

adapted to seal across an annulus between an inner
cylindrical surface (36) of an outer well member (18) and

an outer cylindrical surface (34) of an inner well member
(16).
An assembly according to claim 8, including means
(54,56) for urging the first and second sealing ring 

assemblies toward each other to ensure proper positioning
of the segments (108) in the two sealing assemblies.
An assembly according to claim 8, including wedging
means (32) on one of the well members (16,18) to wedge one

of the legs toward the other leg so that the segments
transmit the wedging force to the other leg to set it in

sealing engagement with the surface of the member against
which it is to seal.
An assembly (80) comprising a first sealing ring
assembly and a second sealing ring assembly each according

to claim 3, the first sealing ring assembly being
positioned to have its legs extending from their base in a

radial direction, the second sealing ring assembly having
its legs extending from their base in a radial direction,

and means for retaining the segments for each of the
sealing ring assemblies in their desired positions between

the legs of their sealing rings.
An assembly according to claim 11, wherein the
segments of one of the sealing rings are in engagement with

the segments of the other sealing ring to provide the
retaining means.
An assembly according to claim 11, wherein the sealing
ring of one of the sealing ring assemblies sharing the base

with the other of the sealing ring of the sealing ring
assemblies with the legs of each sealing ring extending

from the edges of the base in opposite directions to the
other sealing ring.
An assembly according to claim 11, wherein both
sealing rings have their legs extending radially in the

same direction as the legs of the other sealing ring. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the legs
(104,106) of the metal sealing ring (100) each have inner

points of contact (A,B) with the segments (108) positioned
between the legs and points of contact (C,E) with their

respective sealing surfaces (166,168), the points of
contact (C,E) of each leg with its sealing surface being

offset a greater distance from the end of the leg than the
point of contact (A,B) with the segment to provide a moment

in the legs which ensures that the sealing force between
each of the legs and its sealing surface are balanced after

loading both before and after the sealing ring assemblies
are subjected to pressure.
