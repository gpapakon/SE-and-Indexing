<ABSTRACT>
A self-cleaning, non-fouling ionizing air gun for 
static neutralization, comprises:

 
   a barrel (12, 14) having an open rearward end for 

drawing ambient air from the outside into the barrel (12, 
14) and a forward nozzle end for discharging high velocity 

ionized air toward a target area,
 

   ion emitter electrode means (30) positioned at a 
medial portion of said barrel (12, 14), and

 
   means for producing at least one jet (18) of 

compressed air positioned in front of said electrode means 
(30) and arranged to draw ambient air from outside the 

barrel (12, 14) over said electrode means (30) to effect 
ionization thereof without allowing contaminants in the 

compressed air to impinge directly upon said ion emitter 
electrode means (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ionizing air guns or nozzles 
in which a high velocity stream of air is directed over an 
ionizing emitter electrode to expel an ionized stream of 
air toward a target area to effect static neutralization of 
charged particles and removal thereof from the targeted 
surface. More particularly, this invention relates to an 
ionizing air gun which employs a compressed gas for 
discharging a high velocity stream of ionized air against 
a surface in order to neutralize and blast charged 
particles from a selected area. In prior U.S. Patents No. 3, 156, 847 and No. 3, 179, 
849, there is shown and described ionizing air guns or 
nozzles in which an A.C. high voltage generator or power 
supply is connected directly or capacitively across a 
pointed needle electrode co-axially disposed within the 
nozzle of the gun's barrel. A stream of air from a 
compressed air line is directed through the nozzle parallel 
with the needle axis and becomes ionized in its passage 
through the conically radiating high voltage field. Since 
the air stream reinforces the pattern of the ionizing 
field, an extended range of ionized air is delivered from 
the nozzle so as be highly effective both in dislodging 
particles clinging to a surface by electrostatic attraction 
and in neutralizing charges on the particles and/or on the 
surfaces preventing re-attraction. US-A-3643128 discloses an apparatus for projecting 
ionized air in which a conducting tube has a number of 
ionizing tips extending radially outwards, and air passages 
adjacent the tips. An outer tube is coaxially provided, 
and has air passages corresponding to the ionizing tips. 
Compressed air flows through the conducting tube, and over 
the surface of the ionizing tip to ionize the air. The 
ionized air is projected through the air passages of the 
outer tube.  
 In the above cited prior art as well as in the patent 
art set forth below, compressed air or gas from a cylinder 
or tank is utilized as the source for expelling the high 
velocity air through the nozzles:
