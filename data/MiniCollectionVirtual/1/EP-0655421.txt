<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of a solid which is practically insoluble in water and nonpolluting. This process comprises a stage according to which at least two compounds are mixed in aqueous medium with a view to obtaining paste. It is characterised in that one of the compounds, or first compound, includes alkaline-earth metal oxide hydrates, and another compound, or second compound, includes heavy-metal oxide hydrates, and in that the free water present in the paste or the liquid is present in the mixture in a proportion of quantities of between 20 and 60 % by weight of the total mixture, the solid obtained being substantially free from silicates and aluminates. The invention applies in particular to the fields of waste treatment and of building and of public works.

A process for producing a solid which is virtually 
insoluble in water and non-polluting, characterised in 

that it comprises one stage in which at least two 
compounds are mixed in aqueous medium until a paste is 

obtained whose free water content is between 20 wt.% and 
60 wt.%, with respect to the total mixture, and which 

contains less than 20 wt.% of Al
2
O
3
 and SiO
2
, one of the 
compounds or the first compound consisting of alkaline 

earth hydroxides, and another compound or the second 
compound consisting of heavy metal hydroxides; the solid 

being obtained from the paste, without an additional 
drying stage for the said paste at temperatures above 

300°C, the weight of the alkaline earth hydroxides plus 
the weight of the heavy metal hydroxides being greater 

than 30 % of the total weight of the said solid. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
first compound is substantially free of alkaline earth 

oxides. 
A process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that 5 wt.%, with respect to the total 

mixture, of chlorides are added. 
A process according to Claims 1, 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the mixture is made up at a temperature lower than 

280°C and at a pH between 7.5 and 10.5. 
A process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the mixture is made up under 

vacuum. 
A process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the alkaline earth metal is calcium 

or magnesium.  
 
A process according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
alkaline earth hydroxide is lime or magnesia. 
A process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the first compound composed of the 

alkaline earth hydroxide is a Fume Cleaning Residue. 
A process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the second compound contains heavy 

metal hydroxides in the form of particles whose average 
diameter is less than about 200 microns. 
A process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the heavy metal comprises one or 

more of the following metals: chromium, manganese, iron, 
cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, titanium, 

tin and mercury. 
A process according to Claim 10, characterised in that 
the second compound containing heavy metal hydroxides is 

obtained following sewage treatment, after centrifugation 
or filtration, using a filter press or a band filter. 
A process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that alkaline earth oxides are hydrated 

prior to mixing, in order to obtain alkaline earth 
hydroxides.
