<ABSTRACT>
High quality linear polyester resin is prepared by reacting in 
a first step or zone 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid with a 

molten prepolymer derived from a glycol and 2,6-naphthalene 
dicarboxylic acid to form a low molecular weight product of the 

first step or zone; reacting this resultant product with a glycol in 
at least two successive steps or zones of glycol addition to form 

prepolymer; and polymerizing at least a portion of the resulting 
prepolymer to form polyester resin which exhibits midpoint glass 

transition temperatures above about 123°C. The resulting 
prepolymer is particularly suitable for reaction with the 2,6-naphthalene 

dicarboxylic acid in the first step or zone. 
Advantageously, at least a portion of the prepolymer is, therefore, 

returned to the first step or zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for production of high
molecular weight polyester resins from 2,6-naphthalene
dicarboxylic acid. More particularly, the invention relates to a
process for manufacture of high quality polyester resin exhibiting
improved thermal properties. In one specific aspect, this
invention relates to a process of reacting in a first step or zone
2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid with a molten prepolymer
derived from a glycol and 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid to
form a low molecular weight effluent of the first step or zone;
subsequently reacting the resultant effluent with a glycol in at
least two successive steps or zones to form prepolymer; and then
polymerizing at least a portion of the resulting prepolymer to
form polyester resin which exhibits midpoint glass transition
temperatures above about 123°C. The resulting prepolymer is
particularly suitable for reaction with the 2,6-naphthalene
dicarboxylic acid in the first step or zone. Advantageously, at
least a portion of the prepolymer is, therefore, returned to the
first step or zone.In preparing linear polyesters such as polyethylene
terephthalate, a prepolymer consisting of bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate and/or higher ethylene terephthalate oligomers is
polycondensed under vacuum to remove glycol liberated as
prepolymer is condensed. The bis-(hydroxy-ethyl) terephthalate
is usually prepared by either transesterification of dimethyl
terephthalate with ethylene glycol or by direct esterification of
highly purified terephthalic acid with excess ethylene glycol at the
normal boiling point of the glycol.U.S. Patent No. 3,496,220 describes an esterification process
in which hydroxyl-ended oligomer, said to be suitable for
polycondensation to high molecular weight linear polyesters, is
prepared by reacting terephthalic acid with preformed hydroxyl-ended
oligomer to from a carboxyl-ended oligomer which is then 
reacted with glycol in successive reaction zones to obtain the
hydroxyl-ended oligomer. While it is stated that succinic, pimelic,
adipic cyclohexane dicarboxylic, diphenyl dicarboxylic, and
isophthalic acid might be used, this esterification process is
illustrated only by means of embodiments utilizing the reaction of
terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol and formation of the
resulting hydroxyl-ended oligomer. No polycondensation of any
oligomer is reported.U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,445,034 describes a process
for continuous production of polyester from purified terephthalic
acid which polyester is said to have
