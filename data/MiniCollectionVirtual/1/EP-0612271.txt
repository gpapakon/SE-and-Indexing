An air separator comprising a stationary spiral 
casing, a vane ring disposed in the spiral casing in a 

stationary position and with adjustable vanes, a vane 
wheel coaxially disposed inside the vane ring, a 

tangential inlet for crude gas and separating gas and a 
guide edge for coarse material in the end region of the 

spiral flow in the annular space between the vane ring 
and the separating wheel, characterised by 


(a) a tangential inlet tube (2) for introducing 
material for separation into the annular space 

(16) between the vane ring (11) and the vane wheel 
(7); 
(b) a tangential inlet tube (5) for introducing 
separating air in parallel with the inlet tube (2) 

for introducing material for separation; 
(c) mixing the material introduced through the first-mentioned 
tube (2) with separating air introduced 

through the second aforementioned tube (5) through 
the ducts between the vanes (12) on the vane ring 

(11); 
(d) a dusting-material discharge device in the form of 
a guide plate (18) at an angle to the separator 

axis (2) and inclined relative to the flow in the 
annular spa
ce between the vane ring and the 
separator wheel, the guide plate being at the end 

of the flow path towards the inlet for material 
for separation, one edge of the guide plate being  

 
secured to a wall portion (20) of the separator 

casing horizontally on the circle of the vane ring 
(11) and its other end extending up to the 

separator wheel (14); 
(e) separation of the material freed from coarse 
material in the vane ring and discharge of the 

fine material from the annular space surrounded by 
the vanes on the vane wheel, through a fine-material 

outlet (7) disposed concentrically in the 
annular space. 
An air separator according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the angle of inclination of the 

guide plate (18) to the air separator axis (6) is at 
least 45°. 
An air separator according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the ratio of the diameter of the 

vane ring (11) to the diameter of the separator wheel, 
i.e. the vane wheel (14), is not more than 1 : 0.65. 
An air separator according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the ratio of the diameter of the 

vane ring (11) to the diameter of the separator wheel 
(14) is 1 : 0.8. 
An air separator according to any of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the angle of the vanes (12) on 

the vane ring (11) to a tangent to the apical circle of 
the vane ring is 25°.  

 
A method of operating an air separator according 
to at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 

the suitably constructed and arranged vanes (12) on the 
vane ring (11) are so adjusted that the angle of flow 

between the vanes on the vane ring or in the ducts 
between vanes and the cross-sections of the vane ducts 

result in spiral air separation yielding coarser 
separated grains than would correspond to the 

conditions at the outer edges of the vanes on the 
separator wheel.
