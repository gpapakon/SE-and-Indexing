<DESCRIPTION>
The Immunoglobulin (Ig) Gene Superfamily is
comprised of numerous cell surface and soluble
molecules that mediate recognition, adhesion or binding
functions in vertebrates. (Abbas, A.K. et al., CELLULAR
AND MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY, p.144 (1991)). Members of
the Ig Superfamily have an evolutionary relationship
and share significant amino acid sequence and
structural similarities. (Williams, A. F. and Barclay,
A. N., IMMUNOGLOBULIN GENES, p.372 (1989)). Two
criteria for membership within the family are: 1)
sequence homology with Ig or Ig-related polypeptide
domains, which are approximately 70-110 amino acid
residues long, and 2) key structural features which
include the polypeptide domains comprised of a sandwich
arrangement of two β-sheets, each made up of four or
five anti-parallel β-strands of five to ten amino acid
residues. (Abbas, A.K., et al., CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR
IMMUNOLOGY, pp. 144-145 (1991)).The Ig Superfamily domains are classified as
either variable (V) or constant (C) based on
characteristics of the β-strands within the β-sheet
sandwich. (Abbas, A. K., et al., CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR
IMMUNOLOGY, p. 144 (1991)). For example, in one class
of Superfamily molecules, the immunoglobulins, V 
domains are at the amino-terminal ends of separate
"heavy" (H) and "light" (L) chains, succeeded in the
polypeptide chains by constant (C) domains. Thus, in
an immunoglobulin, a V domain is defined as either VH
or VL (Figure 1). In the T cell receptor, V and C
refer to Ig-like variable and constant domains which
are comprised of polypeptide α and β chains. In other
Superfamily molecules, V and C domains may be comprised
of γ, δ, or ε chains.In the Ig Superfamily, the polypeptide chains that
comprise the V regions, associate to form ligand
binding sites. For example, in the immunoglobulin
molecule, the VH and VL domains associate to form the
variable fragment (Fv) region which comprises the
antibody binding site. The Fv region includes both
scaffold-like regions, termed framework regions (FRs),
and regions of hyper-variability, termed
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). It is the
CDRs that contribute to the unique antigen specificity
of immunoglobulins. (Abbas, A. K., et al.,CELLULAR AND
MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY, p.45 (1991)). Under special
circumstances, the Fv region has been proteolytically
dissected from its parent Ig to yield a variable-region
fragment (Fv fragment) that is comprised of two non-covalently
associated domains (VH·VL, a heterodimer).
This heterodimeric Fv fragment can further dissociate
into
