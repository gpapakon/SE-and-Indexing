<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pump has a motor (22) mounted within a housing 
(20) with a shaft (24) extending therefrom to which a 

helically shaped impeller (26) is fitted having at least two 
turns for pumping fuel from a fuel tank (12) to an 

automotive engine. The impeller (26) has an involute shaped 
leading edge designed to efficiently scoop fuel from an 

inlet (30) into a pumping chamber (23) and thereafter to an 
outlet (34) leading to the engine. A trailing edge on the 

impeller (26) has a narrowed width which increases the 
effective flow cross-sectional area, thus increasing the 

fuel pressure. The helically shaped impeller (26) needs no 
separate casing, as is typically required for conventional 

fuel pumps employing regenerative turbines, gerotors, roller 
vanes, or the like, and increases fuel pressure over a 

longer circumferential distance thus decreasing cavitation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automotive fuel pumps, and,
more particularly, to an automotive fuel pump with an axial
flow helically shaped impeller.Various types of in-tank or in-line fuel pumps are
used for pumping fuel from the fuel tank to the engine of an
automobile. One distinguishing feature among fuel pumps is
the type of pumping mechanism employed. For example,
gerotors, roller vanes, and regenerative turbines are common
due to their compactness and ability to generate relatively
high pressures, in the range of 3.5 psi to 150 psi (20 kpa
to 1035 kpa). Since these pumps must rotate at high speeds
to achieve the desired flowrate and pressure, cavitation may
occur, resulting in a host of fuel handling problems,
including fuel vapour within the fuel, hot fuel, noise and
decreased pump efficiency. In order to minimise these
drawbacks, the pumps must be designed to include
compensating features such as vapour purge orifices, vapour
purge channels, modified regenerative turbine impellers, and
dual stage designs with the positive displacement stage
acting at higher pressure heads. These additional features
increase manufacturing costs and may complicate assembly.A contributing factor to the above mentioned problems
with conventional pumping mechanisms is the relatively short
distance over which the fuel pressure is increased. For
example, fuel pumped through a regenerative turbine (Figure
13a) or gerotor (Figure 13b) typically increases in pressure
from about 0 psi to nearly 60 psi (ca. 410 Kpa) over approximately a short
distance, perhaps one (1) centimetre, which is the
circumferential length around the pumping element. This
small distance results from size limitations on the fuel
pump in addition to the physical construction required for
such pumps. The present invention increases fuel pressure
over a longer circumferential distance (Figure 13c) thus
decreasing cavitation and increasing pump efficiency. Another drawback of regenerative turbines and gerotors
is that they are typically housed in a pumping chamber
formed by a cover and a bottom. The pumping chamber is then
mounted within the fuel pump and fuel is drawn through an
inlet in the cover, pumped around the pumping chamber, and
sent through an outlet in the pump bottom leading to the
interior of the pump casing. The need for this pump housing
(cover and bottom) within the fuel pump increases
manufacturing and assembly costs.The present invention provides a helically shaped
rotary pumping element which does not require a separate
pump housing
