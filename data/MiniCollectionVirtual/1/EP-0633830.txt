<ABSTRACT>
The mounting is an arbor (16) or arbor sleeve (10) having a non-symmetrical outer mounting surface (24) onto which is mounted a cutting blade (21) which contains a similarly configured mounting hole (52). The arbor (16) or arbor sleeve (10) is designed for use with a cutting blade (21) having a mounting hole (52) which, when viewed from one side of the blade is the same as the outer mounting surface (24) and which viewed from the other side of the blade is not the same. The use of the arbor or arbor sleeve of the present invention with a cutting blade having these characteristics results in the blade being mounted on the saw in only one orientation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mounting
device for rotating saw cutting blades. More specifically,
the invention relates to a specially configured
arbor and correspondingly configured aperture
in a circular concrete saw blade to prevent the
cutting blade from being mismounted on the saw.Circular saw blades are normally driven by
rotating shafts connected to motors. In many applications,
the rotating cutting blades have circular
holes through the center for acceptance of a circular
drive shaft. The shafts often have a smaller
diameter mounting portion which extends from a
larger primary portion of the drive shaft to form a
shoulder. The blades are typically pressed over the
smaller diameter mounting portion until they are
stopped against the shoulder formed by the main
drive portion of the shaft. The blade is then locked
onto the shaft by clamping it between the shoulder
on the main portion of the drive shaft and either a
threaded locking nut which is threaded onto the
end of the small diameter mounting portion or a
bolt threaded into a threaded hole in the end of the
shaft. The friction from the clamping force prevents
the blade from rotating with the shaft.Often times, material is allowed to enter the
hole in which the clamping bolt is threaded. This
prevents the bolt from being tightened sufficiently
into the threaded hole in the shaft. When this
occurs, there is an insufficient clamping force to
hold the rotating cutting blade against the shoulder,
and because the mounting is circular, the blade
may slip. When the blade slips with respect to the
shaft, the blade speed often decreases rapidly,
causing spalling or chipping of the concrete surface
adjacent groove being cut.In order to remedy this problem, non-circular
arbor sleeves, or cutting blade mounting members,
can be attached to the drive shafts. The arbor
sleeves are normally securely mounted to the drive
shaft, so they do not rotate. For example they can
be clamped, welded, pinned to the shaft, keyed, or
held by set screws. A surface of the arbor sleeve is
used as the surface upon which the rotating cutting
blade is then mounted. The cutting blade is configured
to have a mounting hole of the same size and
shape of the arbor to allow it to be positioned over
the arbor to be driven by the motor drive shaft.Arbor sleeves are normally square or a circular
shaft with symmetric flutes, although they may
have other symmetric configurations. The shape of
the arbor sleeve is symmetrical on its outer surface, 
in order that the cutting blade may be
