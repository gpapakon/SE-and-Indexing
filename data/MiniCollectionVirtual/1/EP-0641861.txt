<DESCRIPTION>
The possibilities of preparing hybrid genes by gene technology open up
new routes for the working-up of recombinant proteins. By linking the
coding gene sequence of a desired protein with the coding gene sequence
of a protein fragment having a high affinity for a ligand (affinity peptide) it
is possible to purify desired recombinant proteins in the form of fusion
proteins in one step using the affinity peptide. By site-directed
mutagenesis it is also possible to introduce specific chemical or enzymatic
cleavage sites at the point of linkage of the affinity peptide and the desired
recombinant protein, so that after the purification of the fusion protein by
means of a suitable affinity resin the desired recombinant protein can be
recovered by chemical or enzymatic cleavage.However, recovering of the desired recombinant protein may turn out to
be extremely difficult when the desired recombinant protein also contains
such chemical or enzymatic cleavage sites in its amino acid sequence. In
such cases, the desired recombinant protein ends up being rapidly
degraded.In order to inhibit this degradation, the present invention provides fusion
proteins and processes which allow the selective cleavage at a specific
chemical or enzymatic cleavage site without affecting the desired
recombinant protein. The methods of the present invention are specifically
applicable for production of hydrophobic polypeptides, proteins or
peptides.In more detail, the present invention is concerned with fusion proteins of
the formula:
A - B - C 
wherein A is a bulky hydrophilic peptide, B is a selected cleavage site, and
C is a desired hydrophobic polypeptide, protein or peptide.The term "bulky hydrophilic peptide" which is used in connection with the
fusion proteins in accordance with the invention relates to hydrophilic
peptides which are characterized by their size and the content of
hydrophilic amino acids giving rise to a well structured domain.The bulky hydrophilic peptide A of the fusion proteins in accordance with
the invention serves a dual function: a) to facilitate high expression of the
fusion proteins and b) to expose the cleavage site C to the mobile phase on
a hydrophobic matrix column. Preferred bulky hydrophilic peptides of the
fusion proteins in accordance with the invention are those with the
peptide sequence of the formula
(NANP) x
wherein x is 10 - 40 and 19 being most preferred.As selected cleavage sites there come into consideration chemical or
enzymatic cleavage sites. As suitable selected enzymatic cleavage
