<ABSTRACT>
A method of processing interferometric data derived from 
an interferometer (20) to eliminate multipath signals and provide 

an improved estimate of relative angle between an emitter (21) 
and the interferometer (20) comprises the steps of gathering 

interferometric data comprising complex signal amplitudes derived 
from the emitter (21) at a plurality of emitter angles relative 

to the interferometer (20); processing the complex signal 
amplitudes derived at each of the plurality of emitter angles 

by maximizing a predetermined log likelihood function corresponding 
to a natural logarithm of a predetermined probability 

density function at each of the plurality of emitter angles 
to produce a plurality of maximized log likelihood functions; 

and selecting as the improved estimate of relative angle between 
the emitter and the interferometer an emitter angle corresponding 

to an optimally maximized log likelihood function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to interferometry, and more particularly, to a 
multipath nulling technique for use in processing interferometer data that rejects 
multipath returns. In conventional interferometry applications, the presence of ownship multipath 
reflections (those reflections caused by the vehicle or platform that carries an 
interferometer or radar) can be detected by the interferometer. Ownship multipath 
reflections, including signal blockage and reflections, degrade the reliability of the 
estimate of emitter angle determined by the interferometer. Techniques to detect 
multipath reflections in interferometer array have been previously developed by the 
assignee of the present invention. However, no effective technique that provides for 
multipath rejection and emitter angle estimation in the presence of multipath has 
heretofore been devised. Consequently, it is an objective of the invention to provide an effective multipath 
rejection and emitter angle estimation technique for use in processing data from 
interferometer arrays. In order to meet the above and other objectives, the present invention is a 
processing method that processes interferometer data to provide for rejection of 
multipath signal returns from an emitter and computes an improved estimate of the  
 
relative angle between the emitter and an interferometer. The present processing 
method comprises the following steps. The first step is to gather interferometric data comprising complex signal 
amplitudes derived from the emitter at a plurality of emitter angles relative to the 
interferometer. The next step is to process the complex signal amplitudes derived at 
each of the plurality of emitter angles to maximize a predetermined log likelihood 
function corresponding to a natural logarithm of a predetermined probability density 
function at each of the plurality of emitter angles to produce a plurality of maximized 
log likelihood functions. The final step is to select as the improved estimate of relative 
angle between the emitter and the interferometer one emitter angle corresponding to an 
optimally maximized log likelihood function. The present processing method thus processes interferometer data to reject 
multipath signal returns from an emitter and compute an improved estimate of the angle 
between the emitter and the interferometer. The present processing method rejects 
ownship multipath and provides for more accurate location of emitters. The processing 
method uses a maximum likelihood function that

from the emitter (21), µ is a normalized voltage vector corresponding 

to a direct path from the emitter (21) to the interferometer

vector for multipath orthogonal to the direct path and is given 
by (
