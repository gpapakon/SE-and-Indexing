<ABSTRACT>
Use of a porous, preferably dimensionally stable, material for the extraction of hydrophobic constituents, such as benzene, toluene, xylene and/or chlorinated hydrocarbons, from an aqueous solution, the material containing a hydrophobic substance exhibiting great affinity for the constituents to be extracted from the water, characterised in that the material has a surface which will be wetted more readily by the hydrophobic substance immobilised in the pores having an average diameter in the range of 0.1 to 50 (my)m than by the aqueous solution, with the proviso that at least 60 % of this substance can be extracted from the pores by a liquid wholly made up of the constituents to be extracted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a porous, preferably dimensionally 
stable, polymer for the extraction of hydrophobic constituents, such 
as benzene, toluene, xylene and/or chlorinated hydrocarbons, from an 
aqueous solution, wherein the polymer contains a hydrophobic liquid 
exhibiting great affinity for the constituents to be extracted from 
the water and has a surface which will be wetted more readily by the 
hydrophobic liquid immobilised in pores having an average diameter of 
0,1 µm or more than by the aqueous solution. 
Such a use, with a porous polymer being employed, was earlier 
described in US-A-4 276 179. The porous polymer used therein is 
obtained from olefinic materials such as polyethylene and 
polypropylene and possesses a rate of adsorption which is believed to 
be a function of the surface area which can vary from about 10 to 
about 40 m2/g. Said surface area is achieved by providing the 
adsorbent with micropores having an average pore size of about 0.01 to 
2 µm (100 to about 20 000 angstroms). The porous polymer is prepared from 
microporous films prepared by the "dry stretch" or "solvent stretch" 
techniques. A major drawback of said polyolefinic films is that they cannot be 
regenerated by stripping with steam as they will drastically lose 
their adsorption efficiency, as only a few hours of heating at about 
100°C will suffice to obtain a surface area which is far below the 
lower limit of 10 m2/g. In GB-A-1 535 481 a porous material is employed consisting of mineral 
carriers which are inert with respect to water, to the hydrophobic 
substance to be used as extractant, and to the compound to be 
extracted. Examples of suitable mineral carriers mentioned are pumice, 
kieselguhr, bauxite, alumina, carbon, or silicates. The particles 
preferably have a size in the range of 0,1 mm to 5 cm. It is stated  
 
that the pore size is critical only to the extent that it should be 
large enough to permit penetration of the compound to be extracted, of 
the extraction solvent, and of the regeneration liquid. In actual practice, using the known materials for the aforementioned 
extraction process is attended with major drawbacks because the 
hydrophobic substances absorbed in them are easily displaced by water, 
especially when a packed bed is employed. In consequence, the water to 
be extracted or purified is in fact contaminated rather than 
decontaminated by these substances. The invention now provides for the use of a porous polymer with a 
hydrophobic liquid contained therein which

<CLAIMS>
Use of a porous, preferably dimensionally stable, polymer for 
the extraction of hydrophobic constituents, such as benzene, 

toluene, xylene and/or chlorinated hydrocarbons, from an 
aqueous solution, wherein the polymer contains a hydrophobic 

liquid exhibiting great affinity for the constituents to be 
extracted from the water and has a surface which will be wetted 

more readily by the hydrophobic liquid immobilised in pores 
having an average diameter of 0,1 µm or more than by the 

aqueous solution, characterised in that use is made of a 
regenerative granulate or powder of a porous polymer having an 

average particle diameter in the range of 0,1 to 10 mm and 
pores in the range of 0,1 to 50 µm, which is obtained by the 

dissolving of a polymer, with heating, at a temperature above 
the upper critical decomposition temperature Tc in the 

hydrophobic liquid, followed by lowering of the temperature, 
resulting in a porous polymer filled with the hydrophobic 

liquid, and the mechanical diminution of the solidified mass. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the average 
pore diameter is in the range of 0,2 to 15 µm. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the hydrophobic 
liquid is a glycerol ester of one or more, preferably 

unsaturated, fatty acids. 
Use according to claim 3, characterised in that the glycerol 
ester is soybean oil and/or castor oil. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the porous 
polymer is a polyolefin. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the porous 
polymer is polypropylene.
