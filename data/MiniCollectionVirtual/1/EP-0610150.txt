<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a composition of several elements, permitting the seeding and therefore the replanting of plants on uncultivated or even sterile soils. The present invention provides a composition for seeding uncultivated soils, using a hydraulic gun or any other means which makes it possible to spread the said composition in the form of a spray mixture, of the type comprising water, mineral and organic supplements and/or organic-mineral fertilisers, as well as seeds, characterised by the fact that the water is present in the proportion of 40 to 85 per cent (%) of the total mass of the composition, in that the mineral supplement is present in the proportion of 6 to 44% of the total mass of the composition, in that the organic supplement and/or the organic-mineral fertilisers are present in the proportion of 3 to 26% of the total mass of the composition, and in that the seeds are present in the proportion of 1 to 3% of the total mass of the composition. Application to the seeding of soils whose ecological system has been disrupted.

Composition for seeding unplanted ground using a water canon or other means
for spreading the said composition in the form of a mixture comprising water, mineral and

organic improvers and/or organo-mineral fertilizers together with the seeds, characterized in
that


water forms 40 to 85 percent (%) of the total mass of the composition,
the mineral improving agents consist of diatomite present as 6 to 44% of the total
mass of the composition,
the organic improving agents and/or organo-mineral fertilizers form between 3 and
26% of the total mass of the composition
and the seeds form 1 to 3% of the total mass of the composition.
