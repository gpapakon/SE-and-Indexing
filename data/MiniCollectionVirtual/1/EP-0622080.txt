<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a gelatinase A 
inhibitor comprising as an active ingredient a peptide 

analogue consisting of an active minimum unit of gelatinase 
A inhibition obtained from APP (β-amyloid precursor) or a 

peptide analogue comprising it. Gelatinase A can be qualified 
and quantified using any of the gelatinase A inhibitors 

according to the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to uses of a gelatinase
A inhibitor, for the manufacture of medicaments for
inhibiting gelatinase A, against cancer metastasis and
against inflammation, the inhibitor comprising peptides
having specific amino acid residues, as defined in claims
1 to 9 appended hereto.Gelatinase A is an in vivo enzyme involved in cancer
metastasis and inflammation. Inhibition of gelatinase A
may serve to prevent cancer metastasis and inflammation.Gelatinase A is found in various tissues and cells,
and known especially as an enzyme which degrades type IV
collagen in the process of cancer metastasis.The gelatinase A inhibitor comprising the peptides
having specific amino acid residues disclosed hereinafter
can be employed as a reagent for qualitative or
quantitative determination of gelatinase A. The invention
therefore provides a process for determining qualitatively
or quantitatively gelatinase A which comprises using a
reagent selected from (a) a peptide having amino acid
residues from 439V (Val) to 687K (Lys) of SEQ ID NO:1, or
a glycosylated peptide thereof, (b) a peptide having amino
acid residues from 18L (Leu) to 687K (Lys) of SEQ ID NO:1, 
glycosylated peptide thereof, (c) a peptide having amino
acid residues from 18L (Leu) to 687K (Lys) of SEQ ID NO:1
in which the residues from 345M (Met) to 363K (Lys) are
deleted, or a glycosylated peptide thereof, and (d) a
peptide having amino acid residues from 18L (Leu) to 687K
(Lys) of SEQ ID NO:1 in which the residues from 289E (Glu)
to 363K (Lys) are deleted, or a glycosylated peptide
thereof.With reference to the accompanying Figures, Figure 1
(SEQ ID No. 1) is the amino acid sequence of APP 770; and
   Figure 2 is a schematic view of APP 770, whose amino 
acid sequence has already been identified as shown in Figure
1.In Figure 2, 1 represents the signal sequence from 1 M
(Met), and 6 represents the peptide which is an active
minimum unit of a gelatinase A inhibitor. This unit, in
which carbohydrate chains are bound at 2 positions as
represented by 2 CHO moieties in this figure, is called
the glycosylated region.In Figure 2, domain 8 penetrates through the plasma
membrane of a cell.In a normal cleavage process, APP is cleaved at the
position designated by the arrow in the part of D in (A) of
Figure 2, i.e., in the sequence of (D) of Figure 2. When D is
not cleaved but closed and domain 7 is cut out at the both
ends of the entire solid part as shown in the figure, the
entire domain 7 is released as beta-amyloid (β AP). Then the
β-amyloid
