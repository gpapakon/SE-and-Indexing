<ABSTRACT>
Improved liquid phase process useful in the hydrocyanation of diolefinic compounds to produce nonconjugated acyclic nitriles and to the liquid phase process of isomerization of the nitriles to, among other thing, 3- and/or 4-monoalkene linear nitriles. The improvement involves conducting the process in the presence of zero-valent nickel and a mutidentate phosphite ligand.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to an improved liquid phase process useful
in the hydrocyanation of diolefinic compounds to produce nonconjugated acyclic
nitriles and to a liquid phase process of isomerization of said nitriles to, among
other things, 3- and/or 4-monoalkene linear nitriles. The improvement resides in
conducting the processes in the presence of zero-valent nickel and a multidentate
phosphite ligand.Catalytic hydrocyanation systems, particularly pertaining to the
hydrocyanation of olefins, are known in the art. For example, liquid phase
systems useful for the hydrocyanation of butadiene to form pentenenitriles (PN)
are known in the art. For example, Drinkard, U.S. 3,496,215, discloses the
hydrocyanation of butadiene using nickel catalysts with monodentate phosphite
ligands. As used in this patent, and as will be used herein, the term
"pentenenitrile" is intended to mean cyanobutene. Likewise, "butenenitrile"
means cyanopropene. Bidentate phosphite ligands complexed to zero-valent
nickel and platinum are known to be useful in the liquid phase hydrocyanation of
butadiene, as described by Baker et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun.,1991,
803-804.The pentenenitriles so formed are subjected to further hydrocyanation
and/or isomerization to form adiponitrile (ADN), a commercially important
material in the manufacture of nylon. For example, Drinkard, U.S. 3,536,748,
discloses the liquid phase isomerization of 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile in the
presence of a zero valent nickel complex and Chia, U.S. 3,676,481, discloses an
improvement additionally utilizing tri(hydrocarbyl)boron promoters.The hydrocyanation of activated olefins such as conjugated olefins (e.g.,
butadiene and styrene) and strained olefins (e.g., norbornene) proceeds without the
use of a Lewis acid promoter, while hydrocyanation of unactivated olefins such as
1-octene and 3-pentenenitrile normally require the use of a Lewis acid promoter.
Teachings regarding the use of a promoter in the hydrocyanation reaction appear,
for example, in U.S. 3,496,217.Certain multidentate phosphite ligands useful in the present invention for
the hydrocyanation of diolefins have been used for the hydrocyanation of
monoolefins. Commonly assigned, WO 95/14659 and U.S. Patent 5,512,696, 
disclose bidentate phosphite ligands preferably used in combination with a Lewis
acid promotor to hydrocyanate monoolefins.WO-A-9622968 discloses a hydrocyanation process in the presence of a
zero-valent nickel and a phosphite ligand containing a phenoxy group.The present
