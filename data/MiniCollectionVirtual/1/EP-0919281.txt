<ABSTRACT>
A sample rack for holding sample tubes in a single row includes
a frame having a longitudinally extending vertical rear wall and a

horizontal top wall. The top wall includes a plurality of sample tube
openings. A plurality of vertical partitions and opposite end walls are

joined to the frame in spaced arrangement to define sample tube
chambers for receiving sample tubes. A front marginal section of the

frame connects the bottom portions of vertical partitions and a leaf
spring device is attached to the marginal section. The leaf spring

device includes a support section and a plurality of arms that extend
upwardly from the support section into the sample tube chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rack for sample tubes and, more
particularly, to a sample tube rack for tubes of different size that can
be automatically transported at a rapid rate in a sample analysis
system.In automated sampling systems, sample tubes are usually
transported from one location to another in order to conveniently
position the tubes for one or more functional operations on the samples
contained therein. Because of the demand for increased test output of
automated sampling systems, it often becomes necessary to
simultaneously transport a plurality of tubes for test purposes.Sample tube racks for holding multiple
sample tubes are known from e.g.
EP-A-0 753 747, US-A-5 672 317 and
DE-U-92 06 037.Although sample tube racks for holding more than one sample
tube are known, such racks are often not feasible for automatic
transport in a sample analysis system because they can become
unstable during movement. As demand increases for high volume test
output of sample analysis systems, there has been an emphasis on
increasing the speed of processing of the samples within the system. If
sample tube racks are used to transport two or more tubes
simultaneously, it may be necessary to limit the speed of movement of 
the rack to assure that the rack remains stable. Also, high speed
movement of sample tube racks may necessitate that there be only
short time periods during which a rack can be loaded or unloaded.
Springs and other detent and holding members within the rack can
delay or interfere with the need for quick loading or unloading of tubes
relative to the rack.It is thus desirable to provide a sample tube rack that is stable
while undergoing rapid movement within a sample analysis system,
permits quick loading and unloading of sample tubes and can
accommodate tubes of different size.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a novel
sample tube rack which can accommodate sample tubes of different
size and shape. A further object of the invention is to provide a novel
sample tube rack that remains stable while being automatically
transported in a sample analysis system. Another object of the
invention is to provide a novel sample tube rack which permits quick
and easy insertion and removal of sample tubes from the rack. Still
another object of the invention is to provide a novel sample tube rack
which has as few as two parts, one of which is a plastic housing
portion which can be molded in one piece, and the other of which is a
biasing spring which can be formed in one piece.The present

<CLAIMS>
A sample tube rack for holding sample tubes in a single row, comprising a frame having a top
wall, a rear wall depending from said top wall and having a lower free

edge, opposite end walls joined to said rear wall and having lower end
portions depending from said top wall below the lower free edge of

said rear wall, at least one partition member spaced between said end
walls to define at least two sample tube chambers, said partition

member having a lower end portion depending below the lower free
edge of said rear wall, a front lower marginal section joining said end

walls and said partition member, and a spring device joined to said
front lower margin and having individual upwardly exte
nding spring
arms each of which is inclined into a respective said sample tube

chamber to bias said sample tube chamber toward said rear wall.
The sample tube rack as claimed in claim 1, including a
plurality of said partitions spaced from each other to define additional

ones of said sample tube chambers between consecutively spaced
partitions.
The sample tube rack as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
spring device includes a main support section and said individual

upwardly extending spring arms extend from said main support
section. 
The sample tube rack as claimed in claim 3, wherein said
individual upwardly extending spring arms are arranged side by side

on said main support section.
The sample tube rack as claimed in claim 3, wherein said
spring device further includes a securement clip on said main support

section for gripping said main support section to said front lower
marginal section.
The sample tube rack as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
rack further includes a transport securement appendage for attachment

to an automatic transport device, and wherein said transport
securement appendage is provided at the bottom portion of each of said

end walls and extend away from said end walls and away from each
other.
The sample tube rack as claimed in claim 1, further
including a collection basin formed separately from said rack frame

and detachably securable to said rack frame at the lower portion of said
opposite end walls.
The sample tube rack as claimed in claim 1, further
including a base portion at the lower portion of said end walls of said

rack frame. 
The sample tube rack as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
top wall has sample tube openings and oppositely disposed riser

portions formed with concave curved recesses that align with the
sample tube openings in the top wall to conform with the upper

periphery of a sample tube that is receivable in each of the sample tube
chambers.
The sample tube rack claimed in claim 1, wherein each
of said sample tube chambers has a tube cradle surface formed on the

rear wall, and wherein said tube cradle surface includes two
converging rear wall portions that are joined by an apex section of the

rear wall.
