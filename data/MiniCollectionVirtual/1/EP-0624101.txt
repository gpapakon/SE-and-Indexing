<ABSTRACT>
A modular, cartridge perfusion system for multiple perfusions and automatic medicament administration is disclosed. Sterile disposable cartridges are used having integrated connections for perfusion lines, inlet valves, liquid distribution channels, pumping chambers, outlet valves, venting filters and chambers for perfusion pressure measurement. The system allows a precise volume of the smallest portions of 3, 6 or more different perfusion solutions and medicaments stored in disposable syringues to be pulsatingly or continuously perfused in rapid succession without medicament incompatibility by means of one or several small-volume pumping chambers with outlet valves, either separately through several veinous patient connections or in parallel through a single veinous patient connection. After being inserted into a universal, electromagnetic-pneumatic or exclusively electromechanical or electro-hydraulic valve-pump-syringue-actuating device, the cartridges are actuated through cartridge openings by pressure thrusts. Since an electronic microprocessor control device is used which is also capable of printing perfusion protocols, and since the device is compatible with other perfusion devices, such as injection pumps, the most different perfusion problems may be solved by fixed programs and by manual preprogramming, considerably alleviating the work of the nursing personnel and substantially reducing costs. An increased safety for the patients is also ensured.
