<ABSTRACT>
A sensing circuit 100 includes two resistors 11 and 12, two pnp transistors 13 and 14,
and a current mirror 15 and 16. Resistors 11 and 12 convert the high voltages present in the

bridge into a proportional current. The current mirror, mosfets 15 and 16, compares I
1
 and I
2
.
If I
2
 is greater than I
1
 the voltage at point A is high. Otherwise this voltage is low. Resistor 12
is chosen smaller than 11 so that under normal operation, when FET 22 turns on, I
2
 is greater
than I
1
 and the voltage at point A is high. During an overcurrent event, the drop across the FET
22, Von, is so great that I
2
 is less than I
1
 and the voltage a point A stays low.

<DESCRIPTION>
Advances in MOSFET technology as well as advances in integrated circuits have made
it possible to apply class D amplifiers to audio applications. A typical Class D amplifier 600 is
shown in Figure 5. The control circuit 660 drives a level shifter 661, which in turn drives upper
and lower power fets. The output of the fets is applied to a speaker through a filter, which
converts the digital output of the fets into an audio analog signal.Class D amplifiers are significantly more efficient than class AB amplifiers. The
disadvantages are higher part count, cost, electromagnetic interference, and poor performance.
With increased integration and the introduction of sophisticated control integrated circuits these
disadvantages are becoming less pronounced. In the near future, class D amplifiers will replace
class AB amplifiers in many applications. Class D amplifiers already have a clear advantage
in high power applications. As the cost and component count of these amplifiers fall, class D
amplifiers will be able to complete with class AB amplifiers in low and medium power
applications.To overcome the poor performance of class D amplifiers, others have suggested a self
oscillating variable frequency modulator as shown in Figure 6. An integrator 610 has an audio
input over an input resistor RIN. It has a digital feedback input A over resistor RDFB, and an
analog feedback at input B over resistor RAFB. The respective analog and digital feedback
signals A, B, are taken from the output of the bridge circuit 620 and the low-pass filter that
comprises the inductor L and capacitor CLP. Let us simply focus on the digital output A and
assume that there is no audio input. In this case, the output at point A is a square wave with
a 50% duty cycle. When the square wave is high, current flows through RDFB into the summing
junction of the integrator 610. Its output ramps down until it reaches the negative threshold
of the comparator 612. R1 and R2 are used to add hysteresis to the comparator 612. These
resistors can be used to adjust the comparator positive and negative thresholds. When the
output of the comparator 612 goes low, the upper FET 22 turns off and after a short delay the
lower FET 624 turns on. The square wave goes low, and current now flows out of the integrator
610 summing junction through RDFB. The output of the integrator 610 reverses and ramps up
until it reaches the positive threshold of the comparator 612. This signals the lower FET 24 to
turn off. After a short delay the upper FET 622 turns on. The
