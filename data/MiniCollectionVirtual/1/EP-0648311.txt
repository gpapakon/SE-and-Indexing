A phase change mechanism is described for varying the phase of an engine camshaft relative the engine crankshaft. The mechanism comprises a drive member (40) to be connected to the camshaft drive, a driven member (14) to be connected to camshaft, a coupling element (18) for transmitting torque from the drive member to the driven member and movable relative to the drive and driven members to vary the phase between the drive and driven members, an inertial member (20) coupled by means of a one-way clutch (22) for rotation with the drive and driven members and having an eccentric crank (20') thereon acting on the coupling element to vary the position of the coupling element in dependence of the angular position of the inertial member, and latching means for arresting rotation of the inertial member at predetermined angular positions, characterized in that the latching means comprise an abutment surface (24) projecting radially from the inertial member (20), a latch member (28) mounted on one of the drive and driven members for transverse sliding movement relative to the axis of the inertial member between two end positions, a pair of opposed abutment surfaces on the latch member disposed one on each side of the inertial member and each engaging the abutment surface on the inertial member in a respective one of the end positions of the latch member and means (38) for switching the latch member between the end positions while the phase change mechanism is rotating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a phase change mechanism for 
varying the phase of a driven member relative to a drive 
member. The mechanism of the invention can be used for 
varying the phase of the camshaft relative to the crankshaft 
in a single camshaft engine or for varying the relative 
phase of the inlet valve camshaft and the exhaust valve 
camshaft in an engine with dual camshafts. The optimum times for opening and closing the inlet and 
exhaust valves in an internal combustion engine vary with 
operating parameters such as engine load and speed. In any 
engine with fixed angles for opening and closing the valves 
for all engine operating conditions, the valve timing is a 
compromise which detracts from the engine efficiency in all 
but a limited range of operating conditions. For this 
reason, control systems have been proposed which vary the 
valve timing during engine operation. Numerous phase change mechanisms are described in the prior 
art using a wide variety of techniques and principles. The 
mechanism which bears the closest resemblance to that of the 
present invention is that described in the Applicants' own 
earlier PCT Patent Publication No. WO90/10788. The latter publication discloses a phase change mechanism 
for a camshaft of an internal combustion engine, which 
comprises a drive member to be connected by a toothed belt 
to the crankshaft, a driven member to be connected to the 
camshaft and a coupling element for transmitting torque from 
the drive member to the driven member. The coupling element 
is connected for rotation with the drive and driven members 
in such a manner that the phase of the driven member 
relative to the drive member is dependent upon the position 
of the coupling element. An inertial member is connected to 
the coupling element by an eccentric crank which causes the  
 
coupling element to move between two end positions when the 
inertial member rotates relative to the drive and driven 
members, and means are provided for applying a torque to the 
inertial member in order to vary the speed of rotation of 
the inertial member relative to the drive and driven 
members. The preferred means for applying a torque to the inertial 
member in this earlier proposal comprised a one-way clutch 
acting between the inertial member and one or other of the 
drive and driven members. Because of torque fluctuations 
acting on the camshaft, the inertial member will naturally 
tend to oscillate relative to the camshaft but, when a one-way 
clutch is interposed between them,

A phase change mechanism for varying the phase of an 
engine camshaft relative the engine crankshaft, comprising a 

drive member to be connected to the camshaft drive, a driven 
member to be connected to the camshaft, a coupling element 

for transmitting torque from the drive member to the driven 
member and movable relative to the drive and driven members 

to vary the phase between the drive and driven members, an 
inertial member coupled by means of a one-way clutch for 

rotation with the drive and driven members and having an 
eccentric crank thereon acting on the coupling element to

the angular position of the inertial member, and latching

radially from the inertial member, a latch member mounted on 
one of the drive and driven members for transverse sliding 

movement relative to the axis of the inertial member between 
two end positions, a pair of opposed abutment surfaces on 

the latch member disposed one on each side of the inertial 
member and each engaging the abutment surface on the 

inertial member in a respective one of the end positions of 
the latch member and means for switching the latch member 

between the end positions while the phase change mechanism 
is rotating. 
A phase change mechanism as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the latch member comprises a pair of permanent magnets at 

its opposite ends, which rotate relative to a stationary 
electromagnet having a magnetic field with radially 

extending lines of force. 
A phase change mechanism as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
the permanent magnets on the latch member project out of the 

plane passing through the abutment surface.  
 
A phase change mechanism as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
the armature of the electromagnet is disposed radially 

inwards of the locus of the two magnets. 
A phase change mechanism as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the latch member is a continuous ring 

surrounding the inertial member, the centre of gravity of 
the latch member lying on opposite sides of the axis of 

rotation of the phase change mechanism in the end positions 
of the latch member, whereby the latch member is retained in 

each of its end positions by centrifugal force.
