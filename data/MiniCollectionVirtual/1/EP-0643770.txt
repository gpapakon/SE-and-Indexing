<ABSTRACT>
Helicobacter pylori is known to cause or be a cofactor in type B gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric tumors. In both developed and developing countries, a high percentage of people are infected with this bacterium. The present invention relates generally to certain H. pylori proteins, to the genes which express these proteins, and to the use of these proteins for diagnostic and vaccine applications. Specifically, molecular cloning, nucleotide, and amino acid sequences for the H. pylori cytotoxin (CT), the "Cytotoxin Associated Immunodominant" (CAI) antigen, and the heat shock protein (hsp60) are described herein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
the cytotoxin-associated
immunodominant antigen of
Helicobacter pylori, to the genes which express
the protein, and to the use of the protein for
diagnostic and vaccine applications.Helicobacter pylori is a curved, microaerophilic,
gram negative bacterium that has been isolated for the first
time in 1982 from stomach biopsies of patients with chronic
gastritis, Warren et al., Lancet i:1273-75 (1983).
Originally named Campylobacter pylori, it has been
recognized to be part of a separate genus named
Helicobacter, Goodwin et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol.
39:397-405 (1989). The bacterium colonizes the human
gastric mucosa, and infection can persist for decades.
During the last few years, the presence of the bacterium has
been associated with chronic gastritis type B, a condition
that may remain asymptomatic in most infected persons but
increases considerably the risk of peptic ulcer and gastric
adenocarcinoma. The most recent studies strongly suggest
that H. pylori infection may be either a cause or a cofactor
of type B gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric tumors, see
e.g., Blaser, Gastroenterology 93:371-83 (1987); Dooley et
al., New Engl. J. Med. 321:1562-66 (1989); Parsonnet et
al., New Engl. J. Med. 325:1127-31 (1991). H. pylori is
believed to be transmitted by the oral route, Thomas et al.,
Lancet i:340, 1194 (1992), and the risk of infection
increases with age, Graham et al., Gastroenterology
100:1495-1501 (1991), and is facilitated by crowding, Drumm
et al., New Engl. J. Med. 4322:359-63 (1990); Blaser, Clin.
Infect. Dis. 15:386-93 (1992). In developed countries, the
presence of antibodies against H. pylori antigens increases
from less than 20% to over 50% in people 30 and 60 years old
respectively, Jones et al., Med. Microbio. 22:57-62 (1986);
Morris et al., N.Z. Med. J. 99:657-59 (1986), while in 
developing countries over 80% of the population are already
infected by the age of 20, Graham et al., Digestive Diseases
and Sciences 36:1084-88 (1991).The nature and the role of the virulence factors
of H. pylori are still poorly understood. The factors that
have been identified so far include the flagella that are
probably necessary to move across the mucus layer, see e.g.,
Leying et al., Mol. Microbiol. 6:2863-74 (1992); the urease
that is necessary to neutralize the acidic environment of
the stomach and to allow initial colonization, see e.g.,
cussac et al., J. Bacteriol. 174:2466-73 (1992); Perez-Perez
et al., J. Infect. Immun. 60:3658-3663 (1992); Austin
