properties such as resolution, profile, etc. and good in 

sensitivity, which comprises a novolac resin obtainable 
through a condensation reaction of a mixed cresol component 

consisting of m-cresol and p-cresol, a mixed xylenol 
component consisting of 3,5-xylenol and xylenols other 

than 3,5-xylenol and an aldehyde compound, a 1,2-quinonediazide 
compound and an alkali-soluble compound 

the molecular weight of which is lower than 900, wherein, in 
said conden
sation reaction, the ratio α of the mixed 
xylenol based on the sum of the mixed cresol and the 

mixed xylenol is not smaller than 10% by mol and not 
greater than 25% by mol and the ratio β of 3,5-xylenol in 

the mixed xylenol is not smaller than 20% by mol and not 
greater than 60% by mol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a positive
resist composition sensitive to radiations such as
ultraviolet rays and far ultraviolet rays including
excimer laser.Recently, with a rise in the integration level
of integrated circuits, formation of pattern of submicron
order is required. As its result, a positive
resist composition more excellent in resolution, profile
and sensitivity is demanded. Particularly in the
production of 16-64 MDRAMs, it is necessary to resolve a
pattern having a line width of 0.5 µm or less with a good
profile and a good sensitivity.In Japanese Patent Application KOKAI No. 63-234249,
there is mentioned a positive photoresist
composition comprising an alkali-soluble novolac resin
and a photosensitizer wherein said alkali-soluble novolac
resin is a product of a condensation reaction between
formaldehyde and a phenol component which is composed of
m-cresol, p-cresol and xylenol and contains at least 10%
by mole of 3,5-xylenol based on the total phenol component.
On the other hand, in Japanese Patent Application
KOKAI No. 1-177032, there is mentioned a radiation-sensitive
resin composition comprising (A) an alkali-soluble
novolac resin which is a co-condensation product 
of (a) at least one member selected from p-cresol, 2,5-xylenol,
3,5-xylenol and 2,3,5-trimethylphenol, (b)
m-cresol and (c) an aldehyde, from which low molecular
weight components have been partially removed, (B) at
least one member selected from 1,2-quinonediazidesulfonic
acid ester of optionally substituted trihydroxybenzophenone,
1,2-quinonediazidesulfonic acid ester of
optionally substituted tetrahydroxybenzophenone, 1,2-quinonediazidesulfonic
acid ester of optionally
substituted pentahydroxybenzophenone and 1,2-quinonediazidesulfonic
acid ester of optionally
substituted hexahydroxybenzophenone and (C) an optionally
substituted polyhydroxybenzophenone, wherein the content
of said (C) polyhydroxybenzophenone is 1 to 50 parts by
weight per 100 parts by weight of said alkali-soluble
novolac resin.In these compositions, however, a pattern
having a line width of 0.5 µm or less cannot be resolved
with a good profile and a good sensitivity.According to the present invention, there is
provided a positive photoresist composition excellent in
properties such as resolution and profile and good in
sensitivity.The present invention relates to a positive
photoresist composition comprising a novolac resin
obtainable through a condensation reaction of a mixed 
cresol component consisting of m-cresol and p-cresol, a
mixed xylenol
