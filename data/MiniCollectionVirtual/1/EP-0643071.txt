<DESCRIPTION>
Bone Resorption Inhibition/Osteogenesis Promotion Compound and Pharmaceutical comprising such compound.This invention relates to compounds having novel bone resorption
inhibition/osteogenesis promotion functions. Further, the invention relates to pharmaceuticals comprising such compounds.Normal retention of bones is accomplished by the balance of bone
resorption and osteogenesis, and when bone resorption is promoted,
bone components are dissolved and decrease, resulting in bone diseases
such as osteoporosis. It is known that sex hormones such as estrogen
have the function of suppressing bone resorption and therefore used as
prophylactics and remedies for osteoporosis in Europe and America.
Nonetheless, it has not yet been confirmed that these hormones
concentrate on the bones, and the possibility of carcinogenesis resulting
from single administration of these hormones cannot be denied.JP-A-4352795 (corresponding to US-A-5183815) discloses agents
for treating bone disorders associated with a reduction in bone mass and
abnormalities in bone resorption or bone formation. The agents consist
of a hydroxyl containing steroidal hormone possessing human bone
resorption antagonist activity or bone formation stimulatory activity and
a residue of an amino or hydroxy alkyl-1, 1-bisphosphonate possessing
human bone affinity, and the steroidal hormone and the phosphonate
residue are covalently linked through a carbamate, carbonate,
thiocarbamate or thiocarbonate group. The agents do not include a
tetracycline moiety.On the other hand, tetracycline type antibiotics have a property such
that they concentrate on the bones, but they have neither the bone
resorption inhibition function nor the ossification function. Only U.S.
Patent Specification No. 4,925,833 describes that tetracycline promotes
the synthesis of bone proteins in the experiments of a cell level. Though
the synthesis of the bone proteins is necessary for osteogenesis, the
synthesis of the bone proteins alone cannot promote osteogenesis. JP-A-6226256 (corresponding to EP-A-0 201 057) discloses a
compound useful for the treatment and prophylaxis of degenerative bone
disorders comprising the reaction product of a bone-seeking agent and
an inhibitor of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase or an inhibitor of bone
resorption. The "bone-seeking" agent, i.e. an agent having the capability
to bind calcium with a tendency to accumulate in bone and to
incorporate into its crystal lattice, may be a tetracycline. The compound
may further include a bridging agent, but does not
