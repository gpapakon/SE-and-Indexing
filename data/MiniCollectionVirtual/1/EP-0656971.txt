<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for making soft tissue paper which includes providing a dry tissue web and then applying a sufficient amount of a chemical papermaking additive from a thin film to the dry web. The chemical papermaking additives are added to the surface of the tissue paper to enhance properties of the paper such as strength, softener, absorbency, and/or aesthetics. The chemical papermaking additive application process includes the steps of diluting the chemical papermaking additive with a suitable solvent, applying the diluted chemical solution to a heated transfer surface, evaporating the solvent from the dilute solution to form a film, and then transferring the film to the tissue by contacting the dry tissue web with the heated transfer surface. Preferably, the tissue web is dried to a moisture level below its equilibrium moisture content before application of the papermaking additive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates 
to a process for applying low levels 
of chemical papermaking additives to the surface of tissue paper for 
enhancing the properties of the paper. e.g., strength, softness, 
absorbency, and/or aesthetics. Consumer products such as toilet tissue, toweling and facial tissue 
made from cellulosic webs are a pervasive part of modern society. In 
general, these products need to possess certain key physical properties 
to be considered acceptable to consumers. While the exact mix of key 
properties and the absolute value of the individual properties will vary 
depending on the nature of the product, nonetheless, softness, wet and 
dry strength, absorbency, and pleasing aesthetic nature are universally 
desirable properties. Softness is that aspect of the fibrous web that 
elicits a pleasing tactile response and insures that the product is not 
harsh or abrasive when it contacts human skin or other fragile surfaces. 
Strength is the ability of the structure to retain its physical integrity 
during use. Absorbency is the property of the fibrous structure which 
allows it to acquire and retain contacted fluids in an acceptable time. 
Aesthetic nature refers to the psycho-visual response that occurs when 
the consumer views the product either alone or in the context of the 
product's surroundings. The most common method for the manufacture of tissue products is the 
wet laid papermaking process. In such a process, individual fibers are 
first suspended in a dilute slurry with water. This slurry is then laid 
on a foraminous screen to remove a large portion of the water and to form  
 
a thin, relatively uniform-weight embryonic web. This embryonic web is 
then molded and/or dried in a variety of ways to form the final tissue 
web. As part of this process the molded and/or dried web is usually 
glued to a drying drum and subsequently creped from the surface of the 
dryer to impart desirable properties. Products made by many existing wet laid processes fall under the 
above description. Examples of such webs that are soft, strong, and 
absorbent and contain at least two micro regions of density can be found 
in, U.S.A- 3,301,746 which issued January 31, 1967, to Lawrence 
H. Sanford and James B. Sisson; US-A-3,974,025 which issued August 10, 1976, 
to Peter G. Ayers; US-A-3,994,771 which issued November 30, 1976, to George 
Morgan, Jr. and Thomas F. Rich; US-A-4,191,609 which issued March 4, 1980, to

<CLAIMS>
A process for applying chemical papermaking additives to a dry tissue 
paper web, said process comprises the steps of: 


a) providing a dry tissue paper web; 
b) diluting a chemical papermaking additive with a suitable solvent to 
form a dilute chemical solution; 
c) applying said dilute chemical solution to a heated transfer surface; 
d) evaporating at least a portion of said solvent from said heated 
transfer surface to form a film containing said chemical 

papermaking additive; and 
e) transferring said film from said heated transfer surface to at least 
one outwardly-facing surface of said tissue web by contacting 

said outwardly-facing web surface with said heated transfer 
surface, thereby transferring a sufficient amount of said chemical 

papermaking additive such that from 0.004% to 2.0% of said 
chemical papermaking additive, based on the dry fiber weight of 

said tissue web, is retained by said tissue web. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the solvent in step (b) is water. 
The process of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said chemical papermaking additive 
is selected from strength additives, absorbancy additives, softener 

additives, aesthetic additives, and mixtures thereof. 
The process of Claim 3 wherein said softener additive is selected from 
lubricants, plasticizers, cationic debonders, noncationic debonders, and 

mixtures thereof. 
The process of Claim 4 wherein said lubricants are polysiloxanes. 
The process of Claim 4 wherein said noncationic debonder is selected 
from sorbitan esters, ethoxylated sorbitan esters, propoxylated sorbitan 

esters, mixed ethoxylated/propoxylated sorbitan esters, and mixtures 
thereof. 
The process of Claim 3 wherein said strength additive is selected from 
permanent wet strength resins, preferably polyamide-epichlorohydrin 

resins, polacrylamide resins, and mixtures thereof, temporary wet 
strength resins, preferably a starch-based temporary wet strength resin, 

dry strength additives, and mixtures thereof. 
The process of Claim 3 wherein said absorbancy additive is selected 
from polyethoxylates, alkylethoxylated esters, alkylethoxylated alcohols, 

alkylpolyethoxylated nonylphenols, and mixtures thereof, preferably alkyl 
ethoxylated alcohols.  

 
The process of any of Claims 4 - 6 further comprising the step of 
applying to said web a sufficient amount of an absorbancy additive such 

that from 0.01% to 2.0% of said absorbancy additive, based on the dry 
fiber weight of said tissue paper, is retained by said web. 
The process of Claim 9 wherein said absorbency additive is a nonionic 
surfactant, preferably an alkylethoxylated alcohol having a melting point 

of at least 50Â°C. 
The process of any of Claims 4 - 6 or 8 - 10 further comprising the step 
of applying to said web a sufficient amount of a strength additive such 

that from 0.01% to 2.0% of said strength additive, based on the dry
