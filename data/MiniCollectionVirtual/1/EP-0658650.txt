<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a polymer-reinforced paper which includes preparing 
an aqueous suspension of fibers, at least about 50 percent, by dry weight, of 

which are cellulosic fibers; distributing the suspension on a forming wire; 
removing water from the distributed suspension to form a paper; and treating the 

paper thus formed with a polymer-reinforcing medium which contains a bulking 
agent 
to give the polymer-reinforced paper. The treatment of the paper is 
adapted to provide in the polymer-reinforced paper from about 15 to about 70 

percent, by weight, of bulking agent, based on the dry weight of the cellulosic 
fibers in the paper. Alternatively, the bulking agent can be added to a polymer-reinforced 

paper after it has been formed. In certain embodiments, the bulking 
agent is a polyhydric alcohol. In other embodiments, the bulking agent is a 

polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight in the range of from about 100 to 
about 1,500. The polymer-reinforced paper has improved cross-direction tear 

when tested with an Elmendorf Tear Tester in accordance with TAPPI Method 
T414, particularly when the paper has a moisture content no greater than about 

5 percent by weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer-reinforced paper comprising cellulosic fibres,
a latex reinforcing polymer and a bulking agent, as well as to methods of forming same.The reinforcement of paper by polymer impregnation is a long-established
practice. The polymer employed typically is a synthetic material, and the paper
can consist solely of cellulosic fibers or of a mixture of cellulosic and noncellulosic
fibers. Polymer reinforcement is employed to improve one or more of
such properties as dimensional stability, resistance to chemical and environmental
degradation, resistance to tearing, embossability, resiliency, conformability,
moisture and vapor transmission, and abrasion resistance, among others.In general, the property or properties which are desired to be improved
through the use of a polymer-reinforced paper depend on the application. For
example, the resistance of a paper to tearing, e.g., the cross-direction tear as
defined hereinafter, is particularly important when the paper is to be used as a
base for masking papers and tapes, abrasive papers for machine sanding, and
flexible, tear-resistant marking labels, by way of illustration only.Moreover, a property such as resistance to tearing can be important for a
given product under only certain conditions of use. By way of illustration, the
cross-direction tear of a creped masking tape typically is directly proportional to
the moisture content of the paper. When the tape is used under conditions of
high relative humidity, the tape retains or absorbs moisture and the cross-direction
tear usually is more than adequate. Under conditions of low relative
humidity, however, such as those encountered during the high temperature curing
of painted surfaces, the moisture content of the tape is reduced, with a concomitant
reduction in cross-direction tear. When the tape is removed from a
surface, slivering, or diagonal tearing of the tape, often occurs. The use of polyhydric alcohols, including polyethylene glycols, is known
in the papermaking art. For example, such materials have been applied locally
to the cut edges of pulp sheet in order to reduce the formation of defibered knots.
Such materials also have been incorporated in pulp sheets to impart improved
dimensional and heat stability, softness and flexibility, wet tensile and wet tear
strengths, and dimensional control at high humidities. They have been used to
stabilize an absorbent batt of non-delignified fibers.Such materials also have been used in methods of producing fluffed pulp
and
