<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for controlling a variation in power and/or in speed of a load (2) such as an asynchronous, synchronous or universal motor, of a transformer, of an inductor, of a capacitor or a resistor, comprising a switch (5) placed on one phase (4) of a single-phase or multi-phase alternating current power supply circuit (3), this switch (5) being associated with means (6) for managing the duty cycle  alpha /T where  alpha  corresponds to the time of opening and of closing of the circuit (3) by the switch (5) and T corresponds to the period of the phase (4) on which this switch is placed. In fact, the switch (5) is of the bidirectional MOS, IGBT or bipolar transistor type, this switch (5) being associated with means for controlling the switching time (9) of the DRIVER type, suitable for extending the switching time on closure so that it lies in a range between 10 microseconds and 1 millisecond.

Device for controlling the power and/or speed variation of a load (2), 
such as of an asynchronous, synchronous, universal motor, a transformer, an 

inductance, a condenser or a resistor, comprising a switch (5), of the bidirectional 
type with a MOS, IGBT or bipolar transistor, installed on one phase (4) 

of a single-phase or multiple-phase alternating-current supply circuit (3), this 
switch (5) being associated with means (6) for controlling the cyclical ratio α/T, 

where α corresponds to the time of opening or closing of the circuit (3) by 
the switch (5) and T to the period of the phase (4) on which this latter is installed, 

characterized in that the switch (5) is associated with switching-time 
control means (9), of the DRIVER type, capable of so extending the switching 

time at the closing that it be within a range varying from 10 microseconds to 1 
millisecond, whilst the means (6) for controlling the cyclical ratio α/T form, 

in addtion, means capable of controlling the opening of the alternating-current 
supply circuit (3) through the switch (5) when being at the coercive field 

of the magntic circuit of the load (2), i.e. during a maximum time upon reversal 
of the direction of the current corresponding to one fourth of half a period 

T as long as one is below a tripping threshold for the rated current corresponding 
to one third of the maximum rated-current value. 
Control device according to claim 1, characterized in that in parallel 
with the load (2) are connected means (10) for recovering the energy accumulated 

by this latter during the opening of the switch (5). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the means (10) are 
formed either by a second bidirectional switch with a MOS, IGBT or bipolar 

transistor controlled in opposition to the switch (5) or by a condenser. 
Control device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the means (6) for controlling the cyclical ratio α/T are formed by a monostable 

circuit (20) provided with external control means (21), such as a potentiometer, 
a switch or the like, in order to allow a user to modulate this cyclical ratio 

α/T and thus the speed and/or the power of the load (2). 
Control device according to claim 4, characterized in that the monostable 
circuit (20) is fed with low-voltage current through a voltage-reducing and 

filtering circuit (22) connected to the terminals of the alternating-current supply 
circuit (3). 
Control device according to claims 4 and 5, characterized in that it includes  
 

signal-shaping means (23) connected to the alternating-current supply 
circuit (3) for supplying to the monostable circuit (20) a square signal with a 

period T and synchronized with the supply voltage Vc. 
Control device according to claim 6, characterized in that the signal-shaping 
means (23) are connected to the voltage-reducing and filtering circuit 

(22) which ensures its feeding, the square signal with a period T supplied by 
these signal-shaping means (23) being of the low-voltage type. 
Control device according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
the switch (5) is of the bidirectional type with a MOS, IGBT or bipolar transistor, 

whilst the control means (6) are so determined as to be capable of controlling 
several opening or closing cycles of the alternating-current supply circuit 

(3) during half a period, the moments of tripping of the cycle or cycles being 
preset or determined by an appropriate detector circuit for suppressing or attenuating 

one or several harmonics generated by a first opening or closing cycle.
