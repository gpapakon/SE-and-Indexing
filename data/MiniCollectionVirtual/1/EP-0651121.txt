<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with a length-adjustable bolt device, such as can be used in windows or doors for locking them. An integral part of the bolt device is an opposed gear which is arranged centrally between bush rods longitudinally displaceably in opposition and which can be actuated via a handle. The invention avoids the need, in each case, to cut the gear linkage projecting on both sides of the narrow sides to a specific wing dimension. This is achieved in that a coupling piece 6a, 6b is arranged fixedly at the free end of the bush rod 4a, 4b and an elongate bolt member 10a, 10b, 11a, 11b can be connected non-displaceably, but releasably, to the push rod by the coupling piece. The bush rod has an offset 5a, 5b which is substantially nearer to the gear 1 than to the coupling piece 6a, 6b at the end of the bush rod 4a, 4b. The elongate bolt member 10a, 10b can be displaced in the coupling piece 6a, 6b when the retaining device 7a is released, but it (11a, 11b) can also be guided rotatably in a thread in the coupling piece 6a, 6b.
