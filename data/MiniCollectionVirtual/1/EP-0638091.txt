<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for
solubilizing lyophilized antihemophilic factor (Factor
VIII complex) preparations.Coagulation of blood is a complex process
requiring the sequential interaction of a large number
of components, nearly all of which are proteins. These
components include fibrinogen and Factors II, V, VII,
VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. A lack of any of these
components, or a nonfunctional component, can lead to
an inability of the blood to clot when required, with
resultant excessive and life-threatening blood loss to
the patient.Factor VIII (antihemophilic factor) is present at
deficient levels, or is absent, in certain individuals.
For example, persons who have a deficiency (or absence)
of Factor VIII, i.e., persons suffering from hemophilia
A, have blood which either fails to clot or clots only 
after longer periods of time than the time required for
clotting in a person who has a normal level of Factor
VIII.Factor VIII is present in plasma as a high-molecular-weight
complex (Factor VIII complex), which
includes Factor VIII:C and von Willebrand factor
(Factor VIII:R or vWf). Factor VIII:C promotes blood
coagulation. Factor VIII:R promotes aggregation of
platelets and, when incorporated into the Factor VIII
complex, acts as a stabilizer for Factor VIII:C.Purification of the Factor VIII complex has
resulted in Factor VIII preparations which have a
purity level of about 90% or greater, and which are
sufficiently stable for storage for long periods of
time in a lyophilized form. As used herein, purity
means the amount of the specified protein as a
percentage of the total amount of protein in a sample.
However, highly-purified, lyophilized Factor VIII
complex compositions, i.e., compositions with a high
Factor VIII:C specific-activity, are difficult to
reconstitute in aqueous solutions such as those
required for use in intravenous injection. The
purified solutions require contact with solvents for
extended periods of time (about 5-6 min.) before they
are resolubilized, and often result in reconstituted
solutions which have poor clarity, thus wasting
valuable time of hospital employees.In addition, the reconstituted Factor VIII complex
compositions have a limited life, requiring that the
reconstituted compositions be discarded after a short
period of time. This presents difficulties in the
treatment of patients who require injections of Factor
VIII complex to maintain blood-clotting ability.
Typically, such patients are injected with a dose of
about 50 units of Factor VIII:C/kg of

A process for producing a lyophilized Factor VIII complex composition
which, when

contacted with water is reconstituted in less than one minute at room temperature, the
process comprising:


providing an aqueous solution comprising Factor VIII complex
incorporating at least 50 units of Factor VIII:C activity per mg of total protein;
adding a solubilizing agent comprising arginine, in an amount sufficient to
enhance the solubility of Factor VIII, and histidine to the aqueous solution to

thereby form a Factor VIII/arginine/histidine solution; wherein the histidine is
present in the Factor VIII/arginine/histidine solution at a concentration of about

0.025 M and
lyophilizing the Factor VIII/arginine/histidine solution to thereby provide
a lyophilized Factor VIII complex composition with enhanced solubility.

22 days at room temperature.
