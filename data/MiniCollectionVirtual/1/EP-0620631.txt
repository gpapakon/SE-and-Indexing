<ABSTRACT>
A central unit (5) drives a plurality of appliances (1-4) 
with encoded signals enabling them to operate, according 

to a programmed sequence. Each appliance comprises a CPU 
(8) driving the central unit (5) with enquiry signals 

which are indicative of the power demanded to perform the 
next working phase of the selected programme. The central 

unit (5) responds to the enquiry signals by driving with 
the enabling signals those appliances (1-4) whose 

contemporary actuation during the concurrence of the 
respective next working phases involves a total power 

consumption not exceeding a maximum value. The appliances 
and the central unit communicate through infrared 

transceivers (6,7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
automatically managing the power input to a plurality of 
domestic electric loads, so as to prevent the electric 
loads from causing excessive total power peaks to be 
absorbed. To this purpose, a number of solutions are known 
including a central control unit capable of driving a set 
of loads, connected to an electric power network, so as 
to distribute over the time the power supplied to the 
loads when a concurrent operation of the same loads would 
involve excessive peaks in the total power absorbed. 
Generally, the central unit comprises a computerized 
arrangement enabling a limited number of electric loads 
to be supplied concurrently, according to a predetermined 
priority sequence, so as to keep the total power 
consumption within a predetermined maximum value. Arrangements of this kind are for instance disclosed in 
EP-0 307 383, US-A-3 906 242 and WO-A-88 02583, wherein 
the central control unit drives the loads, that are 
associated to respective receivers, with encoded control 
signals which can be transmitted by means of TV cables,  
 
telephone cables, conveyed waves, or by means of radio-frequency 
signals. Such systems, which are based on a priority sequence 
herein defined as "ON-OFF" sequence, suffer from several 
drawbacks, particularly where the loads consist of 
relevant domestic appliances which in the common practice 
may be operated concurrently. First of all, it may easily 
happen that the central control unit determines certain 
appliances to be excluded when a user would on the 
contrary like them to work. In any case, an appliance to 
which a low priority has been assigned may only be 
supplied when the duty cycle of one or more appliances 
having higher priority is terminated, thereby involving 
waiting periods that may be undesirably long-lasting. The prior systems referred to above may bring about an 
important inconvenience in case a user at first actuates 
at least an appliance (e.g., a dishwasher) having lower 
priority and later on (e.g., while the dishwasher is 
heating up the wash water) operates an appliance (e.g., a 
cooking oven) having higher priority. At that time it may 
happen that, in order to shave a peak in the power 
absorbed, the automatic management system temporarily deenergizes 
the lower priority appliance. As a consequence, 
the previously heated water in the dishwasher cools down 
during such an interruption and must be heated again when 
the management system re-starts the dishwasher. The 
consequent

Management system for domestic electric loads, 
comprising a programmable central control unit (5) and a 

plurality of domestic appliances (1-4) which are provided 
with respective electronic programmers (8, 9) , are 

connectable to a power supply network and are capable of 
performing relevant selectable operative programmes 

formed by working phases of the associated operative 
elements, the central unit being arranged to drive the 

appliances with encoded enabling signals permitting them 
to operate, according to a programmed priority sequence, 

so as to keep the total power absorbed by the appliances 
below a predetermined maximum value, each appliance (1-4) 

comprising control means (8) associated with the 
respective programmer and arranged to drive the central 

unit (5) with encoded enquiry signals which are 
indicative of the power demanded by its operative 

elements to perform the next working phase of a selected 
programme, the central unit (5) being arranged to respond 

to said enquiry signals by driving with said enabling 
signals, according to said programmed priority sequence, 

those appliances (1-4) whose contemporary actuation 
during the concurrence of the respective next working 

phases involves a total power consumption not exceeding 
said maximum value, 
characterized in that
 the control 
means (8) of at least one of the appliances (1-4) are  

 
arranged to drive the central unit (5), during said 

working phases of the same appliance, with relevant 
encoded state signals in response to which the central 

unit is or is not enabled to discontinue, according to 
said programmed priority sequence, feeding the enabling 

signals to said at least one appliance. 
Management system for domestic electric loads

comprises infrared transceiver means (7) arranged to bi-directionally 
communicate with corresponding infrared 

transceiver means (6) which are each associated with a 
relevant appliance (1-4) so as to transmit and receive 

said encoded signals, 
characterized in that
 said 
transceiver means (6,7) are arranged to bi-directionally 

communicate through reflection of infrared rays by means 
of a reference surface (24). 
Management system for domestic electric loads 
according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the central 
unit (5) is integrated with the programmer of one of the 

appliances (1) and comprises infrared transceiver means 
(7) arranged to bi-directionally communicate with 

corresponding infrared transceiver means (6), which are 
each associated with a relevant one of the remaining 

appliances (2-4), so as to transmit and receive said 
encoded signals.
