<ABSTRACT>
A foldable element (1) for use in a case (20) for a roll (21) of 
photosensitive material, in particular for graphic arts films, which can be used to 

obtain both a support (22) for holding the roll (21) in the case (20) and a spacer 
(23) for filling free space in the case (20) between the case itself and supports (22). 

Folding lines (7), two flaps (8, 9) and at least three slits (14, 15, 16) are formed in 
the element (1), which permit to have a solid structure after bending.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates mainly to a foldable element for use in a 
case for a roll of photosensitive material, in particular for graphic arts film. The 
invention relates also to a support means obtained from the foldable element for 
holding the roll in the case, and to a spacer also obtained from the foldable 
element for filling free space in the case between the case itself and support 
elements. Photosensitive material for professional use such as graphic arts is 
supplied in the form of rolls, in which a photosensitive film is wound onto a 
cylindrical core. The roll is protected by an outer wrapping of a light-tight film and 
by placing it into a case. Within the case, the roll is supported in a suspended condition because 
any direct contact against the walls of the case may damage the light-tight 
wrapping and hence the photosensitive material. Therefore, the roll is supported by 
two support elements, having a plate with a central protrusion which is inserted into 
the core. The diameter of the core and of the roll is standardized, while the length 
may vary within a certain range. It is not a problem to have cores of many different 
lengths, but it is expensive to keep stocks of cases of many different diameters. Therefore, it is normal practice to keep on stock cases of few sizes, and so 
to place in a case of a certain size rolls having different length. The free space left 
between one of the support elements and the internal wall of the case is filled with 
spacers. The problem at the basis of this invention is to provide an element which 
can be used both to support the roll and to fill the free space. This problem is solved, according to the invention, by a foldable element, 
characterized by comprising a flat base, a folding area dividing the base into a first 
and a second portions, a first and a second flaps formed in the first and second 
portions respectively by means of respective first and second cutting lines and first 
and second folding segments, the first and second folding segments forming 
angles of 70-110° and passing through respective first and second reference  
 
points symmetrically positioned on the first and second portions with respect to the 
folding area, a first slit opened in the first flap along a line passing through the first 
reference point and perpendicular to the first folding segment, a second slit opened 
in the second flap along a line passing through the second reference point and 
perpendicular to the second folding segment, a third slit
