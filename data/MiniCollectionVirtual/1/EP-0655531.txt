<ABSTRACT>
Rutting in a layer of liquid asphalt consisting of around 
90 wt.-% minerals and at least 7% bitumen can be counteracted by adding 

metal chips to the mixture of minerals and bitumen. The percentage by 
weight of chips is at least 1, and preferably lies between 2 and 8. The 

chips are a minimum length of 10 mm and a maximum length of 80 mm, and 
are preferably a length between 15 and 40 mm. They are a flat shape, and 

the maximum breadth lies between 1 and 4 mm, while the maximum height 
lies between 0.15 and 0.5 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pourable material for the application 
of a waterproof covering layer which is suitable for foot and vehicular 
traffic, in particular liquid asphalt, consisting of around 90 wt.-% 
minerals with a certain granule distribution, in particular stone 
chippings, gravel, sand and filler, and at least 7% of a binder 
consisting essentially of bitumen. Liquid asphalt is in increasingly common use as a waterproof 
floor finish on roof car parks and walkways. It is a bituminous mortar 
which is processed warm and sets by cooling. The correct granular 
structure of the minerals is important. The skeleton formed by the 
minerals must contain the lowest possible percentage of hollow space. The 
purpose of the filler, with a granule size of less than 63 µm, is to 
reduce the hollow space further, on the one hand, and to stiffen and 
stabilize the bitumen, on the other hand, which ensures that at higher 
temperatures the bitumen does not run out. The acid resistance can be 
increased by a suitable choice of fillers. The application temperature of 
mastic asphalt lies between 200 and 250°C and, since this temperature is 
much higher than the boiling point of water, liquid asphalt must be 
applied to a dry substrate. In order to avoid the risk of residual 
moisture in the substrate (often concrete), liquid asphalt is usually 
poured onto a separating layer of impregnated paper, glassfibre or 
impregnated felt. Any vapour tension under the liquid asphalt can then 
become dispersed. It is known to apply liquid asphalt in two layers on top of one 
another, a mesh-type reinforcement being incorporated in the bottom 
layer, inter alia in order to prevent cracks forming in the top layer 
above the seams of the bottom layer. The seams in the top layer are 
replaced by a relatively broad joint filled with modified bitumen. It has been found in practice that in the case of the 
abovementioned liquid asphalt covering formed from two layers and having 
a reinforcement mesh rutting occurs due to plastic deformation. Rutting 
can in turn lead to cracks. The resistance to compression and the tensile 
strength of the known liquid asphalt coverings leave something to be 
desired. The object of the invention is to avoid these disadvantages, 
and to this end the pourable material mentioned in the preamble is 
characterized in that steel chips are incorporated in the mixture of  
 
minerals and binder in a quantity of at least 1 wt.-%, which chips are a 
minimum length of 10 mm and a maximum length of 80 mm, and
