<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device at exhaust-gas extraction hoses for extracting the exhausts from the exhaust pipe on a vehicle, whereby the exhaust-gas extraction hose (1) is adapted to be retained at the vehicle (4) in an exhaust-gas extracting position (A) when the vehicle (4) is driven in the premises (2), whereby the exhaust-gas extraction hose (1) is automatically releasable from its exhaust-gas extracting position (A) when the vehicle (4) is driven out of the premises (2), whereby the exhaust-gas extraction hose (1) includes a retaining device (8) which can be located on the vehicle (4) spaced apart from the exhaust pipe (3) and whereby an end portion (6) of the exhaust-gas extraction hose (1) includes and/or cooperates with a tightening device (7) which can be tightened by bending and/or stretching the end portion (6) and which retains said end portion (6) in an exhaust-gas extracting position (A) when the retaining device (8) is attached to the vehicle (4). For enabling this tightening device (7) to permit connection of the end portion (6) to the exhaust pipe (3) without the risk of subjecting the exhaust pipe to side loads and/or to damage the side surfaces thereof and/or to permit support of the end portion (6) by vehicle parts instead of by the exhaust pipe (3) if said exhaust pipe is difficult to get at, the tightening device (7) comprises at least one spring means (10) which can be stretched in such a way that said spring means, when the retaining device (8) is attached to the vehicle (4), affects the end portion (6) of the exhaust-gas extraction hose (1) in axial direction (B) or in substantially axial direction (B) such that the end portion (6), through a support means (11) mounted thereon and/or through its end edge (12), is held with pressure against the end edge (13) of the exhaust pipe (3) and/or against vehicle parts (14) situated adjacent said end edge (13) of the exhaust pipe (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
device for exhaust-gas extraction hoses for extracting 
the exhaust from the exhaust pipe of a vehicle, including 
an exhaust-gas extraction hose mountable in 
a suitable location in a premises and having a depending 
part thereof located relative to the exhaust 
pipe so that exhausts therefrom can be removed through 
the hose, 
whereby the exhaust-gas extraction hose is adapted 
to be retained relative to the vehicle in an exhaust-gas 
extracting position when the vehicle is driven 
within the premises, 
whereby the exhaust-gas extraction hose includes a 
retaining device which can be located on the vehicle 
spaced apart from the exhaust pipe, 
whereby an end portion of the exhaust-gas extraction 
hose includes and cooperates with a tightening device 
which can be tightened by bending and/or stretching said end portion 
and which retains said end portion in an exhaust-gas 
extracting position when the retaining device is 
attached to the vehicle, and 
whereby the tightening device includes at least one 
spring means including an upper end portion 
which is connected to said retaining device (8) permitting 
the spring means to be bent and/or stretched in such 
a way that said spring means, when the retaining device is 
attached to the vehicle, biases the end portion 
of the exhaust-gas extraction hose such that said end 
portion, through a support means mounted therein 
or through its end edge, is held with biasing pressure 
against the end edge of the exhaust pipe or 
against a part of the vehicle situated adjacent said 
end edge of the exhaust pipe.  
 A device according to the above type is already known 
from EP-A-0 459 249. This prior art device includes a 
spring means which is pivotally connected to a holder 
permitting the spring means to be stretched downwardly 
permitting the extraction hose to be connected to the 
exhaust pipe and held with biasing pressure upwardly 
against the lower surface of the exhaust pipe. However, 
the connection of the spring means pivotally to the holder 
prevents the spring means to be stretched in other 
direction than downwardly. Hereby, the device according 
to EP-A-0 459 249 can only be used if the extraction hose 
can be threaded upon the exhaust pipe but not if the exhaust 
pipe is hidden by a part of the vehicle. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the 
above problem and provide a device which permits the 
exhaust-gas extraction hose to be placed in suitable 
positions relative to the exhaust pipe even if
