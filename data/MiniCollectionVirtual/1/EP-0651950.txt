<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a fat 
substitute composition comprising apricot puree, 

pulp, paste or liquid extract which may also contain 
an edible emulsifier. The composition may further 

include additional water, acidity stabilisers, sugars 
or a combination of two or more thereof. The 

composition is suitable for partial or complete 
replacement of fat, especially in baked foods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fat 
substitute composition comprising apricot puree, pulp, 
paste or liquid extract which may also contain an 
edible emulsifier. The composition may further 
include additional water, acidity stabilisers, sugars 
or a combination of two or more thereof. The 
composition is suitable for partial or complete 
replacement of fat, especially in baked foods. In todays health-conscious population and with 
medical acknowledgement of the importance of a low fat 
diet there is an ever-increasing demand for low fat 
foods and for low fat cooking ingredients. Many 
consumer markets already cater for customers' 
requirements for reduced fat foods, for example 
"light" and "half-fat" products such as salad 
dressings and cheeses. Manufacturers and consumers are also looking 
towards low fat cooking ingredients. However, 
proposed low fat cooking ingredients have compromised 
the taste and/or the texture of end products. 
Furthermore, low fat ingredients currently on the 
market are not suitable for use in baking due to a 
high moisture content which results in the 
unsatisfactory steaming rather than the desired baking 
of the product. Recent trade reports describe a fat and egg 
substitute known as WONDERSLIM (Registered Trade 
Mark). This low fat product is based on pureed prunes 
and is claimed to be suitable for use in cooking, 
baking and salad dressings. However, use of this 
product has not been entirely satisfactory. It has 
been shown to have an overriding dark pigmentation of 
the end product and when used, in particular in 
baking, does not produce satisfactorily tasty and/or 
textured products.  Accordingly, the present invention provides a 
fat substitute composition comprising apricot puree, 
pulp, paste or liquid extract. Preferably the liquid 
extract is whole liquid extract. The composition 
preferably includes an edible emulsifier such as 
standard edible emulsifiers used in food products. The edible emulsifier is preferably lecithin 
although any other edible emulsifier known in the art 
may be used. Lecithin is a complex fatty acid ester 
which is extracted from soya beans for commercial 
preparations. It is a well known food emulsifier 
which is essential for the regulation of healthy 
levels of cholesterol in man. Egg yolks contain a 
large proportion of lecithin which enables lecithin to 
substitute for egg yolk in baking. A composition 
comprising pureed apricots and lecithin therefore 
provides a fat and egg yolk substitute composition.
