<ABSTRACT>
A plug socket (1), which is used in telephone stations and makes contact with a printed circuit board (11, 12) which is arranged inside the station, for the connection of cables which are terminated with corresponding plugs. The plug socket is intended to be designed such that it can be mechanically and electrically connected to the printed circuit board (11, 12) in an economic manner. To this end, the plug socket (1) is designed such that it can be fastened universally by means of the reflow soldering process with printed circuit boards (11, 12) which are provided with conductor tracks on one side or both sides.
