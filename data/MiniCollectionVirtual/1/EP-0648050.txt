<ABSTRACT>
In a digital image signal recording and/or reproduction technique, a copyright 
protection signal employed by a software tape for use with an analog video tape 

recorder can be recorded and/or reproduced with a digital video tape recorder of the 
compression type. When a copyright protection signal detection circuit (19) detects 

a disturbing signal inserted in a video signal, an output of an analog to digital 
converter (16) is stored in a memory (17). An H counter (21) supplies a line number 

upon detection of the disturbing signal as LINES data to a line pack processing 
microcomputer (23). The data in the memory (17) are supplied as line data to the line 

pack processing microcomputer (23) under the control of a switching circuit (22). 
Using the received data, the line pack processing microcomputer (23) produces pack 

data and sends the pack to a format converter of a digital video tape recorder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to recording and/or reproduction of digital image signals.On a software tape for use with an analog video tape recorder, a signal may
be recorded so as to disturb operation of an AGC (Automatic Gain Control) of a
recording amplifier of a video tape recorder. The disturbing signal is inserted in a
predetermined line within a vertical blanking period of a television signal for the
object of copyright protection. Due to this disturbing signal, when a software tape is
illegally dubbed, then the dubbed tape is recorded in a condition wherein the
reproduced signal is illegible. As a result, the copyright is protected.On the other hand, in digital video tape recorders, an image compression
technique has made a remarkable development in recent years. It is a common
practice to decrease the overall amount of recording signals in order to improve the
picture quality. Therefore, such portions as a vertical 
blanking portion are omitted, because they have no direct relationship to the
picture.For example, in the case of the 525/60 system, 720 samples of data
for an effective scanning period shown in FIG. 39 are extracted with respect
to 240 lines out of 23H to 262H in an odd-numbered field and 240 lines out of
285H to 524H in an even-numbered field. Similarly, in the case of the 625/50
system, 720 samples of data for an effective scanning period shown in FIG. 39
are extracted with respect to 288 lines out of 23H to 310H in an odd-numbered
field and 288 lines of 335H to 622H in an even-numbered field.Image data obtained by extracting only actual image portions in this
manner are compressed to reduce the amount of data and recorded. Thus
recorded image data are processed, upon reproduction, by reverse processes to
those performed upon recording. Therefore, the vertical blanking portions and
horizontal blanking portions, which were deleted upon recording, are added to
the image data so that a composite video signal are outputted.When it is tried to make a software tape for a digital video tape
recorder using such an image compression technique as described above, since
only actual image portions are recorded as described above, it is impossible
to insert a disturbing signal for a vertical blanking period, which is
recorded inserted in a software tape for use with an analog VTR for the object
of copyright protection.The SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) which has been put into
practical use in the field of digital audio tapes is effective for the
copyright protection between digital video tape
