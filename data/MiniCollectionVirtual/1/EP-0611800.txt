<ABSTRACT>
By mixing a hydrophilic polymer into an elastomer 
matrix, elastomers loaded with hydrophilic polymer are 

prepared which have unique properties. In the 
illustrated method, a hydrophilic polymer is mixed with 

an elastomer base polymer. In one embodiment, the 
hydrophilic polymer forms fibers in a resulting 

elastomeric matrix. A base elastomer matrix interspersed 
with hydrophilic polymer made according to the invention 

can be used in reinforced elastomeric products such as 
tires.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for processing
hydrophilic polymer into an elastomer compound,
hydrophilic polymer filled elastomers made by said
method, and tires made using hydrophilic polymer filled
elastomer.Prior art composites used in the tire industry
comprise rubber compositions, for example composites
based on styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), polyisoprene
rubber, polybutadiene rubber, polychloroprene rubber,
nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), ethylene propylene diene
monomer rubber (EPDM), natural rubber and mixtures
thereof. It is continually a goal in the tire art to
provide rubber compounds that enhance traction properties
while providing good rolling resistance properties and
good wear properties.Certain hydrophilic polymers may be derived from
starch. As described by Novon Products, a Division of
Warner-Lambert company, 182 Tabor Road, Morris Plains,
New Jersey, starch consists of two types of glucose
polymers, linear amylose and branched amylopectin. The
distribution of these two polymers effects the properties
of the starch. Although starch in dry form is not
thermoplastic, it forms a melt in the presence of a
plasticizer such as water. The large number of hydroxyl
groups in the starch molecule impart a hydrophilic
character to the molecule that limits its applicability
in the preparation of plastic substitutes based on native
starch, but to increase the range of viable applications
of starch based plastics in product use, native starches
can be blended with degradable synthetics. As little as
1% by weight synthetic polymer greatly improves the
stability of the starch based plastic substitutes. Since
the goal of Novon is to improve the environment by
producing biodegradable plastics, Novon notes that when 
other degradable polymers are blended with starch, or the
starch is modified to improve properties or
processability, the rate of biodegradation will change.
For Novon, the challenge of developing starch-based
plastic substitutes is to improve the properties while
maintaining acceptable degradation rates, and
quantification of biodegradation rates in wastewater,
soil, and compost environments is an important part of
the product development process.Starch materials have been used as model systems in
investigations of physical and engineering properties of
foods. Isothermal absorption of water in starch gels
give low water diffusivities which decrease at lower
moisture contents (Fish 1958).Destructured starch compositions that have
dimensional stability and hydrophilic properties have
been
