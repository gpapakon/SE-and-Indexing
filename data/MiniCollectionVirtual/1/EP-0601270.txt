   a porous burner component being made of a permeable metallic 
material and having a centrally located first region 

(10a,11aa,11ba,11ca) 
where the fuel-air mixture is ejected and the red heat condition 

is formed on the surface of downstream side and having a second region

chamber, wherein the heat recovered in the second region is conducted to 

the first region; the combustion chamber (8) being located covering both 
the first region and the second region and enclosing these 

regions; a fuel-air mixture supply passage (7) to feed the fuel-air 
mixture 

into the central first region; and an exhaust passage (6) to lead the

A combustion apparatus is further provided with a porous burner 
component having a third region (10c,11ac,11bc,11cc) through which 

the fuel-air mixture permeates, which third region is located at 
outside of

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combustion apparatus having a heat-recirculating 
function which preheats a fuel-air mixture using 
the heat-recirculation from high temperature product gas. In 
particular, the present invention relates to a combustion 
apparatus having heat-recirculating function to preheat a fuel-air 
mixture being fed to a porous burner component by waste 
heat from a high temperature product gas being discharged from 
a combustion chamber while making the fuel-air mixture pass 
through and be introduced from the porous burner component into 
the combustion chamber at a velocity not higher than the 
burning velocity of the fuel-air mixture to combust, while 
maintaining the combustion surface of the burner component at 
red heat state comprising: a porous burner component having a 
first region where the fuel-air mixture is introduced and the 
red heat state is formed on the surface of downstream side and 
having a second region being located apart of the first region 
to recover heat from the high temperature product gas coming 
from combustion chamber, wherein the heat recovered in the 
second region is conducted to the first region; the combustion 
chamber being located covering both the first region and the 
second region and enclosing these regions; a fuel-air mixture 
supply passage for feeding the fuel-air mixture into the first 
region; and an exhaust passage for leading the product gas 
discharged from the second region to the exhaust opening, the 
exhaust passage being located adjacent to and outside of the 
fuel-air mixture supply passage and being separated by a first 
separation wall therefrom.  
 Such a combustion apparatus is known from US-A-3 299 938. The 
specific combustion apparatus described therein includes an 
enclosed combustion chamber having an outer wall capable of 
transmitting infrared radiation, the combustion chamber 
communicating, through an auxiliary porous radiating plate, 
with an auxiliary chamber located adjacent to a plenum chamber 
and permitting the utilization of the heat energy contained in 
the hot gases exhausted from the combustion chamber to produce 
infrared heat radiation from the auxiliary radiation plate and 
to preheat the gases in the plenum chamber. These types of plane exothermic surface combustion burners have 
been developed and commercialized as a heat source for 
industrial use as well as for household use because they easily 
generate emissive power with low pollutant emission by adopting 
a porous burner component in a shape of
