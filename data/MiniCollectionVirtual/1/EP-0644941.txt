<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the cloning of novel cDNA sequences encoding human and rat inositol monophosphatase (IMP); to the preparation of IMP enzyme by incorporation of the cDNAs into an expression vector and the expression thereof in recombinant host cells; and to the use of the enzyme thereby obtained in designing and developing medicaments which are inhibitors of human or rat IMP.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CDNA CLONING OF INOSITOL MONOPHOSPHATASEThe present invention relates to cDNA encoding inositol monophosphatase (IMP) which is isolated from brain cells. As used herein, the abbreviation IMP refers to an enzyme which can specifically liberate inositol (Ins) from the naturally occurring substrates Ins(l)P, Ins(3)P and Ins(4)P. IMP is also capable of hydrolyzing certain non-inositol-containing substrates including but not limited to those disclosed in Hallcher and Sherman, (1980), J. Biol. Che . , 224. pp. 10896-10901; Ta imoto et al.. (1985), J. Biochem, (Tokyo), 8_, pp. 363-370; and Gee et al., (1988), Biochem. J., 249. pp. 883-889. The a ino acid and cDNA sequence of bovine IMP is known [Diehl et al. , (1989), J. Biol. Chem., 265, pp. 5946-5949]. Mammalian cells capable of producing IMP include, but are not limited to, brain tissue cells. Transformed mammalian cell lines which may produce IMP include, but are not limited to, brain derived cell lines such as those available from the American Type Culture Collection listed in the Catalogue of Cell lines & Hvbridomas. 7th Edition, 1992. The preferred cells for the present invention include normal human brain-derived tissue cells.Other cells and cell lines may also be suitable for use in isolating IMP cDNA. Selection of suitable cells may be done by screening for IMP activity in cell extracts or conditioned medium. Methods for detecting IMP activity are well known in the art [Ragan et aJL. ,(1988), Biochem. J. , 249, pp. 143-148], and measure the liberation of 1 C-labelled inositol from a substrate. Cells which possess IMP activity in this assay may be suitable for the isolation of IMP cDNA. 

 Any of a variety of procedures may be used to molecularly clone human IMP cDNA. These methods include, but are not limited to, direct functional expression of the human IMP cDNA following the construction of a human IMP containing cDNA library in an appropriate expression vector system. Another method is to screen a human IMP- containing cDNA library constructed in a bacteriophage or plasmid shuttle vector with a labelled oligonucleotide probe designed from the amino acid sequence of the purified IMP protein or from the DNA sequence of bovine IMP cDNA. The preferred method consists of screening a human IMP-containing cDNA library constructed in a bacteriophage or plasmid shuttle vector with a 3 p- labelled cDNA oligonucleotide-primed fragment of the bovine IMP cDNA [Diehl et al. , (1989), J. Biol. Chem., 265. pp. 5946-5949]. The preferred cDNA library is a
