<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a static kwh meter, which comprises 
members (12,13) connected to the wires of the electricity 

network for the generation of measurement signals (U
u
,I
i
) 
proportional to the voltage (U) and to the current (I), while the 

secondary circuit of the current measurement converter (13) 
comprises analog connectors (K₁,K₂), a multiplier circuit 

(11,14) for the formation of a pulse-width/pulse-height modulated 
signal that represents the product of the measurement 

signals (U
u
,I
i
), integration members supplied by the outputs of 
the pulse-width/pulse-height multiplier (14) in the converter 

circuit, from which a frequency signal is obtained, which is 
proportional to the power and which is passed through a divider 

circuit (16) to the counter (17) of the kwh meter for determination 
of the energy that has been consumed. The secondary 

circuit of the current measurement converter (13) of each phase 
is a multiplier circuit (14), which is connected with analog 

connectors (K₁,K₂) that operate in opposite phases, said analog 
connectors being controlled by the pulse sequence received 

from a pulse-width modulator (11). The direct currents (+I
p
,-I
p
) 
received from the analog connectors (K₁,K₂) of the multiplier 

circuit (11,14), which are proportional to the power and 
of opposite signs, are fed to at least two current-frequency 

converters (15a,15b), whose output frequencies (f₁,f₂) are 
summed in a summing unit (18), and the sum frequency (f₁ + f₂) 

that is formed is the ultimate frequency proportional to the 
power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a static kWh meter according to
the preamble of independent claim-1 which corresponds to the
disclosure of WO 85/00893.With respect to the prior art, reference is made to the FI
Patents Nos. 67,960 and 67,961
in which static kWh meters are described that are based on a pulse-width/
pulse-height multiplier, i.e. on a time-division multiplier. The main components of
such a kWh meter, i.e. a three-phase meter, comprise members connected to the
wires of the electricity network for the generation of measurement signals Uu, Ii
proportional to the voltage U and to the current I, a multiplier circuit for the
formation of a pulse-width/pulse-height modulated signal that represents the product
of the measurement signals, and integration members supplied by the output of the
pulse-width/pulse-height multiplier in a converter circuit, from which a frequency
signal proportional to the power is obtained, which signal is passed through a divider
circuit to the counter of the meter for determination of the energy consumed.Such a prior-art static kwh meter is illustrated in Fig. 1 in the drawings. In the
meter, a sequence of sample pulses is formed, in which the pulse width is proportional
to the momentary value of the voltage, and the pulse height is proportional to
the momentary value of the current, the area of the pulses being proportional to the 
product of voltage and current, i.e. to the power. As a rule, the sample pulse
frequency is about 10...20 times higher than the mains frequency. The modulating
signal in the pulse-width modulator is a signal proportional to the mains voltage,
which signal is formed by means of a voltage divider. From the pulse-width modulator,
a pulse sequence is obtained, in which the width of each pulse is proportional
to the momentary value of the mains voltage.In view of accuracy of measurement, it is preferable to use current measurement
converters in the current form, because, in such a case, no precision resistors are
needed in parallel with the secondary circuits of the current measurement converters,
nor are second precision resistors needed, by whose means the voltage pulses
received from the sampling swithches are converted to current pulses, which are fed
to the integrator of the voltage-frequency converter. The principle of operation of a
voltage-frequency converter is similar to that of a current-frequency converter, with
the difference that in a voltage-frequency converter the voltage to be converted is
first converted to current, and this
