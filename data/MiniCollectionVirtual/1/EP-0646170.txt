<DESCRIPTION>
 Diabetoσene rad: A TYPE II DIABETES SPECIFIC GENE Background of the Invention The invention relates to the genetic basis of diabetics.Diabetes mellitus is among the most common of all metabolic disorders, affecting up to 11% of the population by age 70. Type I (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or IDDM) diabetes represents about 5 to 10% of this group and is the result of a progressive autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic 3-cells with subsequent insulin deficiency. Type II (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM) diabetes represents 90-95% of the affected population but is much less well understood from the point of view of primary pathogenesis. Type II diabetic patients exhibit elements of both insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.Alterations in glucose homeostasis are the sine qua non of diabetes mellitus and occur in both the Type I and Type II forms of the disease. In the mildest forms of diabetes this alteration is detected only after challenge with a carbohydrate load, while in moderate to severe forms of disease hyperglycemia is present in both the fasting and postprandial states. The most important tissue involved in disposal of a glucose load following oral ingestion, i.e., in the absorptive state, is skeletal muscle. (Klip 1990 Diabetes Care 13:228-243; Caro et al. 1989 Diab . Metab . Rev. 5:665-689; Bogardus 1989 Diab . Metab . Rev. 5:527-528; Beck-Nielsen 1989 Diab . Metab . Rev. 5:487-493) Skeletal muscle comprises 40% of the body mass, but has been estimated to account for between 80 and 95% of glucose disposal at high insulin concentration or following an oral glucose load. (Beck- Nielsen 1989; Baron et al. 1988 Am . J. Physiol . 255:E769- 74) In insulin-treated animals, about 25% of an 

intravenous glucose load enters muscle within 1 minute. (Daniel et al. 1975 J. Physiol . (Lond) 247:273-288)Skeletal muscle takes up glucose by facilitated diffusion in both an insulin-independent and insulin- dependent manner and has been shown to express relatively high levels of GLUT4 (the "insulin responsive" glucose transporter) and low levels of GLϋTl and GLUT3 (the transporters believed to be involved in basal glucose transport). (Mueckler 1990 Diabetes 39:6-11; Bell et al. 1990 Diabetes Care 13:198-208) Once inside the muscle, glucose is rapidly phosphorylated by hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate. Although the rate-limiting step for glucose uptake is at the level of transport, there is increasing evidence that the major control of carbohydrate metabolism is
