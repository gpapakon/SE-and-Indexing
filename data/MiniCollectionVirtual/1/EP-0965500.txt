<ABSTRACT>
The airbag arrangement has a gas cushion (2) that can be inflated with gas by a filling device (3) to penetrate into the passenger compartment in response to a sensor trigger and a controller (4) for the filling device. The quantity of gas delivered to the gas cushion can be controlled in response to a sensor signal delivered by a sensing medium that detects the displacement of the cushion. At least one sensor element (1) that responds to a local pressure change mounted on the side of the cushion moving towards the occupant feeds a sensing signal to the controller. An Independent claim is also included for a method of controlling an airbag arrangement.
