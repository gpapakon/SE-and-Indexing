<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an apparatus in which, under the control of a protocol computing unit (PMC), which is connected to a computer (PC) via an interface (PCS), data can be written to a knowledge base memory (KBM) in the form of a dual-ported RAM, and read from it by the fuzzy logic coprocessor (FLC), and in which some of the address bus signals (AFLC) which are generated by the fuzzy logic coprocessor can be synchronised by a synchronisation circuit (SYNC), written to a FIFO memory, and read by the protocol computing unit. The invention also concerns a method by which step-by-step debugging (on-line debugging) is possible, without a host computing unit (MC) of the fuzzy logic coprocessor being loaded with it, so that the time behaviour of a fuzzy controller under emulation is different from normal operation.
