<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tank (1), comprising:
 

   a jacket (2);
 

   two end plates (3,4) in each of which a continuous hole (5,6) is 
present;

 
   a flange plate (7,8) which is coupled to each end plate 

by means (16-18) and in which a continuous hole (9) is present for 
sealed passage of a product gradually delivered by an extrusion device. 

The tank according to the invention has the characteristic that the 
coupling means comprise:

 
   positioning means (12) for positioning the flange plate relative to 

the end plate;
 

   sealing means (14) for axially sealing the flange plate relative to 
the end plate; and

 
   pressing means for pressing the flange plate in axial direction to 

the end plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tank, comprising:
 
   a jacket;
 
   two end plates in each of which a continuous hole is 
present;
 
   a flange plate which is coupled to each end plate by 
means of coupling means and in which a continuous hole is 
present for sealed passage of a product gradually delivered 
by an extrusion device. Such a tank is intended for retaining a desired shape 
by underpressure and/or by cooling a product, for instance a 
tube, gradually delivered by an extrusion device by means of 
cooling water supplied by sprayers. The flange plate at the 
front and at the rear serve to seal relative to the through-fed 
product in order to maintain the underpressure present in 
the tank which may have a value in the order of magnitude of 
0.4 bar. For this purpose a perforated sleeve serving as a 
calibrator connects on the feed side to the continuous hole 
in the flange plate and on the rear side the continuous hole 
in the flange plate is provided with a flexible sealing ring 
which is deformable in the manner of a diaphragm and can thus 
seal against the delivered product. The delivered product is 
pulled through the tank and out of the extrusion device by a 
pulling device. Known flange plates are coupled to the relevant end 
plate by means of bolts and nuts. Because a tank is used for 
different diameters, frequent changing of the flange plates 
is necessary. The passage dimensions of the continuous holes 
and the associated sealing rings are in any case adapted to 
the sectional dimensions of the product to be passed through. 
The fixing of flange plates by means of screws and bolts and 
their subsequent removal is very tedious and time-consuming. 
Due to the relative uncertainty with regard to the exact 
positioning there is the further danger that through lack of 
alignment the exact dimensioning of a delivered product is 
not sufficiently guaranteed.  A further drawback of the known manner of fixing is 
that it is very difficult to ensure the desired complete 
sealing of the flange plate in relation to the end plate. Use 
is often made in this respect of silicon rubber sealing 
masses. This entails extra cost, loss of time and pollution. 
The removal of a flange plate which seals relative to the end 
plate by means of silicon rubber can also often be laborious 
because the silicon rubber displays a certain adhesion to the 
surfaces. Prior to placing of a subsequent flange plate the 
relevant surfaces must therefore be thoroughly cleaned. The invention provides a tank free of the stated

<CLAIMS>
Tank, comprising: 
   a jacket; 

   two end plates in each of which a continuous hole is 
present; 

   a flange plate which is coupled to each end plate by 
means of coupling means and in which a continuous hole is 

present for sealed passage of a product gradually delivered 
by an extrusion device, 

   characterized in that 
   the coupling means comprise: 

   positioning means for positioning the flange plate 
relative to the end plate; 

   sealing means for axially sealing the flange plate 
relative to the end plate; and 

   pressing means for pressing the flange plate in axial 
direction to the end plate. 
Tank as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the sealing means comprise a sealing ring. 
Tank as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the pressing means comprise at least one closing member with 

handle, which closing member comprises a rise surface which 
is rotatable by operation of the handle. 
Tank as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that at 
least one closing member is embodied such that in the free 

situation the outward displacement of the flange plate is 
blocked and this displacement can be unblocked by further 

operation of the handle.
