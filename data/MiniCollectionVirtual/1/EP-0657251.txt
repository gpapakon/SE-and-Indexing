<ABSTRACT>
A cutting-off grinding disc for stationary grinding machines has an annular-cylindrical inner carrying element (2) made of metal and a grinding ring (1) surrounding the latter, these being connected to one another. The grinding ring (1) projects beyond the carrying element (2) on both sides in the direction of the common axis (4). The grinding ring (1) can be fully worn down. The carrying element (2) is reusable or at least recyclable.

An abrasive cutting-off wheel for stationary grinding machines, comprising 

an inner support (2, 2') in the form of an annular disk, and 
a grinding ring (1) in the form of an annular disk having at least one reinforcement 
layer (14, 14') and resinoid bonding of the abrasive grain 

and a recess (3), which is formed concentrically of a central longitudinal 
axis (4) and in which the support (2, 2') is disposed and joined to the 

abrasive ring (1),
 
wherein 305 mm ≤ Da ≤ 1800 mm applies to the outside diameter (Da) of 

the abrasive ring (1). 
An abrasive wheel according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 at least one 
front face (5) of the abrasive ring (1) projects from a front face (6) of the 

support (2, 2'). 
An abrasive wheel according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
abrasive ring (1) and the support (2, 2') are glued together. 
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a gap (7) 
that is filled with a glue layer (10) is formed between the outer circumferential 

surface (9) of the support (2) and the inner circumferential surface 
(8) of the abrasive ring (1) which defines a recess (3). 
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in 
that
 the inner circumferential surface (8) of the abrasive ring (1), which  
 

defines the recess (3), and/or the outer circumferential surface (9, 9') of the 
support (2, 2') are cylindrical. 
An abrasive wheel according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the abrasive 
ring (1) and the support (2) are glued together by means of modified 

phenolic resin. 
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in 
that
 the support (2, 2') consists of sheet metal. 
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in 
that
 the reinforcement layer (14, 14') consists of reinforcing threads (18) 
which run tangentially in the vicinity of a central opening (19) and radially 

tangentially towards the outer circumference and which are deflected at the 
outer circumference. 
An abrasive wheel according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcing 
threads (18) extend tangentially and radially tangentially in a 

straight line. 
An abrasive wheel according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcing 
threads (18) partially spiral from the central opening (19) towards 

the outer circumference. 
An abrasive wheel according to claim 8 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the 
reinforcing threads (18) are glued together at their positions of intersection 

(20).  
 
An abrasive wheel according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the thickness 
(e) of said support (2') is less than the thickness (a) of said abrasive 

ring (1) and in that, on its outer circumference, the support (2') is provided 
with a substantially annular cylindrical rim (24), the length (b) of which in 

the direction of the central longitudinal axis (4) exceeds the thickness (e) of 
the support (2'), and on the outer circumferential surface (9') of which the 

abrasive ring (1) is mounted. 
An abrasive wheel according to claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the abrasive 
grain (15) is partially forced into said outer circumferential surface (9') 

of the rim (24). 
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in 
that
 the abrasive ring (1) comprises a poly-condensation adhesive as a 
bonding agent (16). 
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 12 to 14, 
characterized in 
that
 the outer circumferential surface (9') of the rim (24) is provided with a 
glue layer (25) of the same kind as that of the bonding agent of the abrasive 

ring (1). 
An abrasive wheel according to one of claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in 
that
 450 mm ≤ Da ≤ 1800 mm applies to the outside diameter (Da) of the 
abrasive ring (1).
