<ABSTRACT>
A sectionalized electrical distribution feeder system for carrying electrical power from a source point to a use point or a distribution point. Each section (14) of the distribution system includes a substantially cylindrical enclosure (18) capable of being easily cut with a hand saw. The enclosure also provides support and protection from physical damage to a plurality of electrical conductors (22) which are disposed within the enclosure. The conductors (22) are held firmly in place by a number of electrically insulating supports (50) which snugly fit inside the enclosure. Each conductor (22) can be easily cut with a metal cutting hand saw, and is enclosed in an electrically insulating sheath which can be removed from a newly cut end to provide a contact surface. A joint connecting member (26) is provided for electrically connecting the conductors (22) of adjacent sections of the electrical distribution feeder system. A joint cover connects the two adjacent enclosures together and provides additional protection for the joint connecting member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field to which this invention pertains is electrical distribution feeder
systems for use in industrial and commercial locations.In the past, industrial and commercial electrical distribution feeder systems have
generally employed cable and conduit, cable and cable tray, cable and wireway, or electrical
busway. Where cable is used with conduit, the conduit must first be installed and then cables
are pulled through it to complete the installation. Cable used with cable tray or wireway again
involves the installation of the cable tray or wireway first and then laying of cables in the tray
or wireway to complete the installation. Busway installations are generally simpler than cable
and conduit or cable and tray or wireway since the conductors are already inside the protective
enclosure and require no additional labor after the enclosure is installed. Busway designs of the
past have generally included a number of bus bars having a rectangularly-shaped cross-section
placed parallel to one another in a common plane and installed in a rectangularly shaped
enclosure. The sections of busway are produced in specific lengths which can not be altered in
the field during installation. For this reason, if special lengths are required they must be
engineered and manufactured at the factory. This special engineering and manufacturing
requires additional time for shipment to the job site and generally an increase in cost to the
customer. GB-A-1,087,605 discloses a bus-way which includes rod-type bus-bars wherein
individual lengths of bus-way may be more readily connected end to end. Bus bar connection
devices are also used which serve as physical support for the bus bars within the bus-way
trunking.WO-A-92/17922 discloses an electrical feeder system which includes one or more
lengths of a generally cylindrical tubular enclosure which can be similar in construction to
conventional metallic conduit. Disposed within the enclosure are a plurality of substantially
rigid electrical conductors. End plugs are provided at each end of each length of enclosure for
sealing the ends of the enclosure and supporting the conductors therein. The end plugs are
made of an electrically insulating material and are dimensioned to be sealingly received within
the ends of the lengths of enclosure. Longitudinal passageways are provided within the end 
plugs for tightly receiving each of the conductors. The passageways are spaced apart from each
other and the inner wall of the enclosure to prevent physical and electrical contact
