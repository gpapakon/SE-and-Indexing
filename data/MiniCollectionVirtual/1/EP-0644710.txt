<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a ballast for starting and operating a high-pressure gas discharge lamp, in which, after starting, additional power which is a function of, inter alia, the lamp voltage is fed to the high-pressure gas discharge lamp. An additional time-control device lowers this additional power to a lower value when gas due to a defect, the high-pressure gas discharge lamp does not reach the stationary burning voltage (operating voltage) after the predetermined time and in this way prevents a destruction of the ballast by overloading.

<CLAIMS>
Ballast for starting and operating high pressure gas
discharge lamps, which is fed by a battery (B), having at least

one current and/or power regulated voltage converter (S) which
is connected by way of an igniting device (Z) to a high

pressure gas discharge lamp (GDL) and connected to an input (E)
of a current/power desired value source (L) where an input

signal is present corresponding to the lamp voltage, and having
an output (A) at the current/power desired value source (L) by

means of which a current/power desired value is supplied to the
voltage converter (S), the current/power desired value

source (L) also determining, by means of the current/power
desired value given to the voltage converter (S), the magnitude

and duration of additional power supplied to the high pressure
gas discharge lamp (GDL) after igniting dependent upon the

operating condition of the high pressure gas discharge
lamp (GDL) and limited by the maximum permissible lamp current,

characterised in that an additional timing control (T) is
provided which is independent of the operating condition of the

high pressure gas discharge lamp (GDL) and which lowers or
completely cancels, after a set predetermined time, the

additional power supplied to the high pressure gas discharge
lamp (GDL) after igniting.
Ballast according to claim 1, characterised in that the
additional timing control (T) is started upon connection of the

ballast (VG) and reset upon disconnection of the ballast (VG).
Ballast according to claim 1, characterised in that the
additional timing control (T) is integrated in the voltage

converter (S) or in the current/power desired value source (L).
Ballast according to claim 1, characterised in that the
time predetermined for the timing control (T) is markedly

greater than the start up time of an intact high pressure gas
discharge lamp (GDL).
