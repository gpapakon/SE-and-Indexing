<ABSTRACT>
Simple methods for magneto-optical current measurement and magneto-optical ammeters are specified, which are independent of temperature influences on the measurement result and require no compensation device for the light intensities of the light sources (LD1, LD2) used. Light beams (1, 2) from the two laser light sources (LD1, LD2) are alternately polarised orthogonally to each other by means of a beam splitter (3) and transmitted, via collimators (4, 6) which are connected via a polarisation-maintaining high-birefringence HB fibre (5), through a magneto-optical current sensor (7), an analyser (10), 2 collimators (11, 12) and multimode fibres (13) and (14) to photodetectors (DA, DB). 1st and 2nd light-power signals SA1, SB1, respectively, and 3rd and 4th light-power signals SA2, SB2, respectively, are derived one after the other from the photodetectors (DA, DB). Using a function generator (22) of a control and evaluation device (15), a current density I detected by the magneto-optical current sensor (7) is calculated according to: I = [SA1 . SB2/(SA2 . SB1) - 1]/(8 . V), V being the magneto-optical Verdet constant. It is possible to work with frequency-division multiplexing instead of time-division multiplexing. A low-birefringence LB fibre can be used instead of a solid-optical current sensor (7), light being propagated in both directions and evaluated separately.
