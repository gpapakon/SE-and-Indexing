<ABSTRACT>
A cable splice enclosure (10) including a pair of 
cover members (12,14) joined along a flexible hinge 

(62,64) and rotatable together about the hinge to enclose 
a cable splice (150) and secure to each other with latches 

along both side edges (16,18;92,94). Sealant material 
(120) disposed within central regions (32,34) of both 

covers environmentally seals the surfaces of the splice 
connection (154,158,160) upon full closure. Embossments 

(44,46) on both sides of the cable-receiving channels 
(20,22) in associated pairs (40,42,48) proximate the cable 

exits include resilient flange portions cooperate to press 
into the cable insulation upon full closure to define a 

strain relief.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of enclosures for
electrical cable splices, and more particularly to
sealant-filled enclosures for coaxial cable splices.Splices of electrical conductors generally must be
insulated and sealed for environmental protection of the
connection. A variety of enclosures have been devised
into which the spliced conductors are disposed after the
connection has been completed. An example of such an
enclosure is disclosed in document US-A-3,183,302 in
which an elongate casing comprises a pair of
semicylindrical clamshell members joined axially along an
integral hinge and together define a cavity into and along
which the in-line spliced connection of two wires is
disposed. The clamshells are rotated together about the
connection and latched together, with the wires extending
outwardly of wire exits at each end at which an array of
resilient strips engages the insulation of the respective
wires. Pairs of resilient internal tabs are said to
preclude any substantial longitudinal movement of the
splice connection within the casing, by abutting the ends
of the connector in which the ends of the conductors are
spliced by crimping. The casing may include a sealant
material therewithin for sealing the exposed conductors of
the wires from the environment.Other splice enclosures are disclosed for use with
in-line splices such as: Document US-A-3,879,575
containing gel and secured together with clips about the
periphery; US-A-4,935,582 containing a layer of mastic
sealer lining the in-line groove and latched-together
cover halves; and US-A-5,099,088 comprising a transparent
vacuum molded plastic sheet bendable about an axial hinge
and containing opposed reservoirs of gelled photocurable
sealant, and including bendable wire-engaging portions at
the wire exits. Still others are disclosed for use with in-line
splices and including various mechanisms for generating
biasing force of the sealant material against the sealed
conductive surfaces of the splice connection, and various
mechanisms for securing the enclosure covers together, as
in document US-A-4,550,220 having a flexed plastic cover
containing a foam sealant core and latched by interlocking
edges; US-A-4,610,738 including a bolt and nut arrangement
for securing the splice in position, an organizer for use
with multiple spliced connections, and external spring
clip fasteners; US-A-4,849,580 having an internal convex
spring plate; US-A-4,859,809 having an external spring
surrounding deformable cover halves; US-A-4,963,700 with a
pair of

<CLAIMS>
An enclosure

a) of the type having first and second cover members (12,14)
securable together along mating faces thereof,
b) of the type having first and second cover members (12,14)
molded of resilient material in a single piece,
c) joined to each other along hinge-adjacent side edges (16,18) by
a flexible living hinge portion (62,64), and
d) include integral complementary latching members (96,112)
along hinge-remote side edges (92,94) that are engageable upon

closure of the cover members (12,14) about the cable splice
(150),
e) thus fully securing together at said mating faces without other

fastening means,
f) integral complementary latching members (60,86) are disposed
along said hinge-adjacent side edges (16,18),
g) defining a pair of cover members (12,14) containing integral
securing means for assuredly securing to each other along both

pairs of opposed side edges;

   
characterized in that:
h) said first and second cover members (12,14) include upstanding
wall portions (80,102) and complementary wall-receiving

regions (84) along said hinge-adjacent and hinge-remote side
edges (16,18;92,94) inwardly of said complementary latching

members (60,86;96,112),
i) each said upstanding wall portion (80,102) having a leading end
adapted to bear against a complementary surface of a said

complementary wall-receiving region during closure of said
first and second cover members,
j) bounding a central region (32,34) of said cover members for
retention of sealant material (120) therewithin.
An enclosure as set forth in claim 1, further characterized in that

a) each of said first and second cover members (12,14) includes a
said upstanding wall portion (80,102) along one of said adjacent

and remote side edges (16,18;92,94) and
b) a said complementary wall-receiving region along the other
thereof,
c) all complementary to a said upstanding wall portion (80,102)
and wall-receiving region of the other of said first and second

cover members (12,14).
The enclosure as set forth in one of claims 1 or 2, further characterized
in that each said pair of opposed side edges (16, 18; 92, 94)

includes at least two spaced apart complementary latching members.
