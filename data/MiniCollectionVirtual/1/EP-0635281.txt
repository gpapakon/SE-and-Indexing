<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for looking for leakage in an electrode device, especially in a pacemaker or defibrillator electrode, comprising an electrode cable with an elongate, flexible conductor whose outside is provided with an insulating layer and whose inside forms a channel. In order to obtain an arrangement for looking for leakage which is simple to construct and hence cheap to produce and in which one or more leakages in an electrode device implanted in a patient can be detected in an extremely simple manner with the aid of the arrangement it is proposed, according to the invention, that the arrangement be a tubular flexible member (2, 14) whose outside diameter is smaller than the inside diameter of the channel (10) and which is inserted in the channel (10) of the electrode cable (6) up to the distal end, and that the proximal end of the member (2, 14) be connected to a container (3) for fluid (5) which can produce a superatmospheric pressure, so that the fluid (5) is transported through the member (2, 14) and into the channel (10) and can thus fill the channel (10) such that a radial fluid pressure is produced in the channel (10) which is higher than the pressure surrounding the electrode cable (6).
