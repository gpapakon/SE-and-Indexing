<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and methods for coating an article (30) on a 
flat line, powder coating system (24) comprises a powder 

coating booth (32) with a reduced inlet opening (71) for articles 
to be coated and an enlarged outlet opening (115) for coated 

articles. Powder spray guns (100) of the tribo-electric type, 
or having internal charging electrodes, are arranged in 

rows with parallel tube spray heads and are disposed at a 
shallow angle (C) with respect to the conveyor to spray 

powder onto the articles (30) generally in the direction of 
conveyor movement. Baffle plates (204,204A) are installed under the 

spray guns (100) so that any powder which collects on the spray 
guns (100) does not fall on the articles (30) being coated. 

Oversprayed powder is collected from a part of the booth (32) 
intermediate the spray guns (100) and the enlarged outlet 

opening. Preferably, the thickness of powder coating on 
the articles (30) in the precured condition is measured and 

the system is controlled so that the coating thickness is 
uniform and of the desired thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrostatic powder
coating of a part or article. More particularly, the
invention relates to a flat line, powder coating system
and method of operating the system to spray a coating of
powder on a part, article, or continuous strip of material
such as a metal coil, and in the most preferred
embodiment, subsequently measuring the thickness of the
powder coating while the powder is still in a precured
condition.Powder booths for electrostatic application of
powder materials to continuous flat strips or individual
parts or articles of metal typically include a spray 
booth and a conveyor for carrying the article to be
sprayed through the spray booth, as discussed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,901,666. In prior art, flat line,
electrostatic powder spray systems of the type illustrated
in Fig. 1, the coating powder 8 was typically applied by
at least one corona type spray gun 10 disposed
perpendicular to the surface 11 of an electrically
grounded article 12 being spray coated. The perpendicular
orientation of spray gun 10 to surface 11 of article 12
was important so that an electrostatic field 14, generated
by an external electrode (not shown) in spray gun 10, was
uniform with respect to article 12. This insured that a
uniform umbrella of charged coating powder 8 was sprayed
towards electrically grounded article 12. As long as
article 12 was transported by a conveyor 16 at an
operating speed of about 0.05 to 0.13 m/s (ten to about twenty five feet per
minute (fpm)), as was common in the prior art coating
systems, the corona spray gun 10 was able to provide an
adequately uniform coating 18. To better insure the
uniformity of coating 18, spray gun 10 could be
incorporated in groupings of identical guns and/or the
gun(s) could be oscillated in a direction transverse to
the direction of movement of conveyor 16.With the present emphasis on increasing production
efficiency while lowering production costs, there is a
continuing effort to increase the speed of conveyor 16 to
a range between about 0.18 and 1.02 m/s (thirty five fpm and two hundred
fpm). When conveyor 16 is operating at these higher
speeds, the particles of powder 8 moving normal to
surface 11 of part 12 being coated, must be able to
adhere to a fast moving surface 11. Using one or more
prior art external electrode corona-type, powder coating
guns 10, positioned as illustrated in Fig. 1, the
operational speed of conveyor 16 was limited to between 
about 0.05 and 0.13 m/s (ten fpm and twenty five fpm), because a uniform
coating 18
