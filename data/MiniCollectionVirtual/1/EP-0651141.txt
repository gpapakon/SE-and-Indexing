<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a four-cycle engine comprising
a cylinder block and a cylinder head, a chain drive means for
driving at least one camshaft from the primary drive shaft, a
chain cover extending along a side of the engine and a cooling
arrangement including a water pump for circulating cooling
water through the engine, said chain cover defining at least partially
a housing for a water pump.Conventionally, in four-cycle engines for automobiles, a
water jacket surrounds the outside of the cylinders, and coolant
from the radiator is circulated through this jacket to cool the
engine. A water pump and its drive propel this coolant, which
has become heated after cooling the engine, back to the radiator,
where it is cooled, and then, to return the coolant to the water
jacket.In general, the water-pump impeller-housing is mounted on
the cylinder block so that said impeller housing connects to a
coolant passage linking it with the opening of the water jacket,
and a pulley on the rotating shaft of the impeller is driven by
belt from a crankshaft pulley. Part of the coolant supplied by
the water pump is circulated to the oil cooler.However, when attaching the water pump to the engine as-a
part of the above described conventional cooling structure for
four-cycle engines, if the side of the engine is covered by a
chain cover, then the cover must go around this area, leaving the
water pump to protrude from the side of the engine. Not only
does the water pump protrude substantially from the engine unit,
but attachment of a separate hose to the coolant passage is
required in order that it be able to supply coolant to the oil
cooler. 
An engine of the type mentioned at the beginning is known from US-A-5 148 784. The
water pump shown there causes the chain cover to bulge outwardly and thus increases
the overall length of the engine.Accordingly it is an objective of the present invention to
improve a four-cycle engine as indicated above in that the
disposal of the water pump of the cooling arrangement no longer
renders the water pump to substantially protrude from the
engine unit, thus rendering the engine more compact.This technical problem is solved by a four-cycle engine according to claim 1.The water pump of the cooling arrangement circulating the
cooling water through the cylinder block and cylinder head of
the engine being integrated into a chain cover area itself,
which improves the layout and compactness of the engine.The water pump can be arranged at the side of the engine along its width where it
