<ABSTRACT>
A burner and port combination for the combustion of a fuel/air 
mixture (such as a pulverized coal fuel plus air mixture) comprises a 

throat (25) and a burner nozzle (10) positioned at a central area of 
the throat (25). The burner nozzle (10) has an inlet (11) for 

receiving the fuel plus air mixture and an outlet (12) for discharging 
the fuel plus air mixture. A secondary air tube (30) is positioned 

adjacent the burner nozzle (10) at each lateral side of the nozzle (10) 
in the throat (25) for providing a first portion of secondary air (35) 

to the throat (25). A plurality of vanes (15) are positioned at upper 
and lower portions of the throat (25) above and below the burner nozzle 

(10) and the tubes (30), for deflecting a second portion of the 
secondary air (35) from the burner nozzle (10). In an alternative 

arrangement, the burner nozzle (10) is at the bottom of the throat (25) 
with the secondary air tubes (30) on each side and the vanes (15) above 

the nozzle (10) and tubes (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to combined burners and ports for 
combustion of fuel/air mixtures, such as those for burning fossil 
fuels. Low NOx pulverized coal-fired burners, such as the burner 
disclosed by US Patent No. US-A-5 199 355, rely on principles of air 
and fuel staging to reduce emissions of NOx. The effectiveness of these 
measures depends upon the design of the burners and the furnace to 
which they are applied, amongst other factors. In order to further 
reduce NOx emissions, NOx ports (over fire air ports, air staging ports) 
are employed in order to remove a portion of the air from the burners 
for introduction downstream in the combustion process. In typical wall fired utility boiler applications, the burners 
are arranged in multiple elevations on the front and/or rear wall of 
the lower furnace. Low NOx burners are installed at these locations for 
new boilers, or retrofitted to existing boilers. For a given 
application, the actual NOx emissions from these burners vary across the 
height of the burner zone due to the changing thermal environment. The 
bottom elevation of the burners resides in the coolest portion of the 
furnace and produces the lowest NOx emissions. The top elevation of the 
burners produces the highest NOx since temperatures in the furnace at 
that location are reaching a maximum. This contributes to the 
formation of thermal NOx. In addition, the upward flow of gases from the lower burner 
elevations impinge on the flames of the upper burners, accelerating the 
mixing of air and fuel, which contributes to fuel NOx. These effects are 
documented in numerous tests of boilers, which show that removing the 
top row of burners from service reduces NOx, while removing the bottom 
row of burners from service increases NOx (compared to all burners in 
service). NOx ports have become necessary to achieve NOx emission 
objectives. NOx ports are normally positioned above the top burner 
elevation; and the effectiveness of the NOx ports is a function of how 
much air is diverted from the burners to the ports, and the distance 
from the burners to the ports. However, in many existing boilers it is  
 
difficult to find a suitable location above the burners to locate the 
ports. The height of the furnace or arrangement of the heating surface 
or the auxiliary equipment prevents the addition of ports above the 
burners. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a 
burner and port combination for the combustion of a fuel plus air 
mixture, the burner and
