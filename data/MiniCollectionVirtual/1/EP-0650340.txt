<ABSTRACT>
A castor (10) for extensible furniture elements guided on castors has a castor body (12) made of dimensionally stable hard plastics mounted on a castor axis and provided with a continuous groove-like recess (28) which opens into the rolling surface and has at least one depression. A rolling ring (20) made of an elastically deformable material, preferably elastomeric plastics, projects slightly above the rolling surface of the castor body (12) in which it is integrated. The plastic material is introduced in a fluid state into the groove-like recess (28) with one or more depressions and in its elastically deformable final state it form-fittingly engages the groove-like recess and the depression(s). A ring-shaped groove (26) opens into a side face of the castor body (12) and the depression(s) of the continuous groove-like recess (28) which receives the integrated rolling ring (20) are designed as a throughchannel (22) which extends up to the ring-shaped groove (26).

<CLAIMS>
A wheel (10) for roller pull-out guides for furniture parts, 
which can be pulled out, with a roller body (12) made from 

dimensionally stable hard plastic rotatably mounted on a 
roller axle, which roller body (12) has an open, peripheral 

groove-like recess (28), which ends in the bearing surface 
and has at least one depression, and with an integrated tire 

(20) of an elastically deformable material, preferably an 
elastomeric plastic, protruding slightly above the bearing 

surface of the roller body, which tire is introduced in 
flowable form into the groove-like recess (28) with the at 

least one depression and, in its elastically deformable 
final state, positively engages the groove-like recess and 

the depression, characterized in that a peripheral, annular 
groove (26), ending in a lateral surface of the roller body 

(12), is provided in the roller body (12), and in that the at 
least one depression, ending open in the bearing surface of 

the roller body (12) and starting from the peripheral, groove-like 
recess (28) for the integrated tire (20), is constructed 

as at least one channel (22) continuing up to the open annular 
groove (26) ending in the lateral surface.  

 
The wheel (10) of claim 1, characterized in that the at 
least one channel (22) starts out from the bottom surface 

(18) of the peripheral groove-like recess (28). 
The wheel (10) of claims 1 or 2, characterized in that 
several, preferably four, channels (22) are provided. 
The wheel (10) of claim 3, characterized in that the 
channels (22) start out from the groove-like recess (28) 

offset at equal angular intervals. 
The wheel (10) of one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the channel or channels (22) extend in the opening 

direction of the molded parts of a roller body injection 
mold forming the groove-like recess (28) and are shaped so 

that they do not form an undercut that would interfere with 
the opening of the mold. 
The wheel (10) of one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the annular groove (26) is disposed in a circular disk-shaped 

depression (24) within the side wall of the roller 
body (12).
