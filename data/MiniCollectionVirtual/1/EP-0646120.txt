<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a synthesis of a manganese complex 
useful as a bleach catalyst. Peroxide bleaching agents have been used for many years in 
laundry compositions. Such agents are effective in removing 
stains, such as tea, fruit and wine stains, from clothing at 
or near the boiling temperatures of the laundry composition. 
The efficacy of peroxide bleaching agents diminishes sharply 
when laundry compositions are used at temperatures below 
60°C. It is known that many transition metal ions catalyse the 
decomposition of H2O2 and H2O2-liberating percompounds, such 
as sodium perborate. It has also been suggested that 
transition metal salts together with a chelating agent be 
employed to activate peroxide compounds to render them usable 
for satisfactory bleaching at lower temperatures. However, 
not all combinations of transition metals with chelating 
agents are suitable for improving the bleaching performance 
of peroxide compound bleaches. Many combinations indeed show 
no effect, or even an adverse effect, on the bleaching 
performance. A recent advance in this technology was 
reporting in European Patent Specification No. 458397. 
Therein was reported a class of highly active bleaching 
catalysts in the form of a manganese complex having the 
general formula: 
[LnMnmXp]zYqand 
especially the species: 
[MnIV 2(µ-O)3(Me-TACN)2](PF6)2H2OSeveral of the aforementioned complexes were first 
synthesised and described by K Wieghardt in the "Journal of 
the American Chemical Society", 1988, Vol. 110, No. 22, page  
 
7398, as well as in the "Journal of the Chemical Society - 
Chemical Communications", 1985, page 1145. The synthesis route as described in the above art involved 
the reaction, in aqueous medium, of a manganese (III)-compound, 
e.g. Mn (III)-triacetate, with a nitrogen-containing 
ligand, e.g. 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, 
using an ethanol/water mixture as the 
solvent. A disadvantage of this route is that only low 
yields of the dinuclear Mn (III)-complex are obtained. 
Another disadvantage associated with the process of the art 
is that, owing to the slow crystallisation of the product, 
long reaction times are necessary. Still another 
disadvantage is that, besides crystallisation of the desired 
product, decomposition also seemed to occur, yielding 
manganese dioxide which contaminates the product. Therefore, 
a purification process is required when the product is to be 
converted into the dinuclear Mn (IV)-complex. More recently there was reported a process for the
