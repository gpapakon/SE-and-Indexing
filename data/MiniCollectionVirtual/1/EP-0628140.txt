<DESCRIPTION>
PLUGTECHNICAL FIELD:The present invention relates to a plug for joining different parts, for example wooden parts. Such plugs have an extended field of use but are especially much used in the furniture industry for joining different details in furniture made of wood.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:Plugs, especially within the furniture industry, are usually made of wood. They generally have a circular section for filling up a circular bore hole in the details that are to be joined. The plugs have most often been made with a very narrow marginal so that they have to be punched in. A certain elasticity is then required of the plug and/or the surrounding material. It can for many purposes be sufficient to punch in a plug to get a sufficiently good joining of the details that are to be joined but most often the plug has to be dipped in a glue before the joining or the hole is provided with a glue. The reason for this is of course that the plug shall not as time goes on, loosen.If a glue is used it is therefore important that this glue or adhesive has a good adhesion to both the plug and the surrounding material. This usually means that the plug and the surrounding material must be made of the same or a similar kind of material so that the adhesive adheres equally to both materials. This means accordingly a 

limiting of the material from which the plug can be made which within the furniture industry means that it will mainly be a question of wooden plugs.TECHNICAL PROBLEM:The above plugs have been well tested and fulfils in most cases their tasks. It can, however, for different reasons be desirable to use a plug of another material than the one that shall surround the plug. The reason for this can be that one needs a greater strength or flexibility of the plug or that it has to be manufactured in greater series of a cheaper material such as plastics. The problem that then will arise is that the adhesive which one has to use does not have the same adhesion to the plug as to the surrounding material of the plug. A conventional plug with a conventional glue would therefore as time goes on probably loosen.THE SOLUTION:It has therefore long been a desire to be able to solve the above mentioned problems with plugs, adhesives and surrounding material and according to the invention one has therefore brought about a plug for joining of for example wooden details which is characterized in that it consists of a firm core having recesses and a around the core, meltable or in a solvent solvable adhesive in solid shape and

CLAIMS:
1. Plug for joining of for example wooden parts, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that it consists of a firm core (1) having recesses (2) and a meltable or in a solvent soluble adhesive (4) surrounding the core, which adhesive is in a solid shape and has high mechanical strength and which is anchored in the core (1) and has a good adhesion to the surrounding material of the plug, the surface layer of the adhesive being intended to be melted or solved during the joining.
2. Plug according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the core (1) consists of plastics, metal or wood.
3. Plug according to any of the claims 1 or 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the core (1) has in section the shape of a cross.
4. Plug according to claim 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that recesses (2) have been made in the wings of the cross.
5. Plug according to any of the claims 1-4, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the adhesive is soluble in water or in organic solvents.
6. Plug according to any of the claims 1-5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the adhesive consists of bone glue, multiple components glue of resins or the like.
