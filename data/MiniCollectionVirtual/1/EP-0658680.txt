<ABSTRACT>
A control method according to the invention for operating a turnstile arrangement, in which there are provided blocking means which are arranged about an axis of rotation and which, during normal operation, can be actuated successively, after the opening of a passage for a person, into a position blocking this passage and, when an event disturbing normal operation, such as a power failure, occurs, can be moved at least out of their blocking position into a position of non-use allowing the unchecked passage of persons, provides, after the movement of a blocking arm into its position of non-use, when the triggering event lapses, for returning this blocking means as a result of the action of return forces into its normal operating position and for locking it releasably in this.

A controlling method for the operation of a turnstile installation serving to check the
passage of persons, with a barrier element which is rotatable about a hinge axis fast with

the installation and which comprises barrier means which extend forth from the hinged axis
at preferably equal angles and which are movable out of their normal operative settings

into settings of non-use and for the remainder are actuable one after the other out of a
rotary setting which blocks the passage of a person into one freeing that passage in

consequence of rotation of the barrier element about its hinge axis, wherein - on each
stepping-on of a barrier means out of its barrier position into a setting freeing the passage

of a person - the barrier means following in the direction of rotation is moved into the
blocking position and - on the occurrence of an event, such as current failure, disturbing

the normal operation - at least the barrier means standing in the barrier position is moved
out of its position barring the passage of persons into a setting of non-use enabling the

unchecked passage of persons and this barrier means is resettable into its normal
operative setting after the disappearance of the mentioned event as well as releasably

detentable in this operative setting, characterised thereby, that the barrier element stands
in driving connection with an electrical stepping motor and that - after disappearance of the

event initiating the movability of at least the barrier means, which stands in the barrier
position, into its setting of non-use - restoring forces, which cause the resetting of a barrier

means standing in a setting of non-use into its normal operative setting with respect to the
hinge axis of the barrier element, are brought into effect on the barrier means standing in

the setting of non-use by stepping the barrier means forth through at least one forward
step.
Controlling method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that in the case of
a turnstile installation with a rotational axis of the barrier element inclined to the horizontal

and standing at least nearly horizontally in its blocking positions as well as on the
occurrence of the event causing the movability of the barrier means into a setting of nonÂ¶

use under gravitational effect of tilted-away barrier arms as barrier means, the resetting of
a tilted-away barrier means takes place under gravitational effect when the hinge axis of

this barrier means runs through a lower region of its circulatory path at the barrier element
on the rotation of the barrier element about its axis of rotation. 
Controlling method according to claim 2, characterised thereby, that in the case of
a turnstile installation with three barrier arms arranged about trigonally relative to the

rotational axis of the barrier element, the resetting of a barrier arm, which was tilted away
into a setting of non-use, into its normal setting is carried out on the switching of the barrier

element forward through two successive switching steps.
Controlling method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the barrier
means moved into their settings of non-use are, after the disappearance of the event

initiating their movability into the settings of non-use, reset into their normal settings during
the stepping-on of the barrier element and in consequence of inertia forces arising in that

case and acting in those barrier means.
