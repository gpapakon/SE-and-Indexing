<ABSTRACT>
The table according to the invention comprises an upper metal panel (1) which is connected via its underside to a lower panel (6) which is made of wood or chipboard and whose edges are set back from the edges of the upper panel (1). The lower panel (6) is fixed to a frame (7) having an upper supporting surface (14) bordered by a continuous outer peripheral lip (15) which bears beneath the lower surface of the upper panel (1) with interposition of a sealing joint. The frame consists of longitudinal members (8) and transverse members (9) which are joined by corner pieces (10) in which the legs (11, 12, 13) are fixed.

<CLAIMS>
Metal table comprising a metal upper plate (1)
adapted on a frame-shaped structure (7) equipped

with legs (11, 12, 13), with the metal upper
plate (1) being interlocked along its lower

surface with a lower plate (6) which is wooden or
in laminated chipboard, the edges (23) of which

are set back from the edges of the upper plate
(1), with the frame (7) being made up of

longitudinal members (8) and receiving the legs
(11, 12, 13), characterized in that :


the frame (7) comprises cross members (9)
connected up to the longitudinal members (8)

by corner pieces (10) which themselves
accommodate the legs (11, 12, 13),
the frame (7) includes an upper bearing
surface (14) adapted to receive and bear the

peripheral area of the lower surface (22) of
the lower plate (6) with which it is

interlocked,
the frame (7) has a continuous rising external

peripheral lip (15), surmounting the upper
bearing surface (14) by a height which is

slightly less than the thickness of the lower
plate (6), 
a seal (17) connects the external peripheral
lip (15) to the lower face (18) of the

extending part (16) of the upper plate (1), in
such a manner that the edge (23) of the lower

plate (6) is enclosed within a sealed
peripheral compartment.
Table according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the metal upper plate (1) is glued onto the lower

plate (6).
Table according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that the upper bearing surface

(14) of the frame (7) is interlocked with the
lower plate (6) by self-tapping screws (49) which

are screwed from the upper face (19) of the lower
plate (6), before the upper plate is glued (1).
Table according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the upper bearing surface

(14) of the frame (7) includes an intermediate
groove (21) adapted for the recessed fitment of

sealing means, such that they rest in the
intermediate groove (21) and abut the lower face

(22) of the lower plate (6).
Table according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the longitudinal members

(8) and the cross members (9) are made out of a
hollow tubular section. 
Table according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the corner pieces (10) include a central part

(27) with an upper bearing surface (14) for the
lower plate (6) and with an external peripheral

lip (15), with the central part (27) being
adapted to receive a leg (11) and hold it

substantially perpendicular to the plane of the
frame (7), and with the central part (27)

extending through two lateral end pieces (29, 30)
adapted and arranged to enter, leaving little

slackness, and be secured in the respective
longitudinal (8) and cross (9) members adjacent

to the corner piece (10).
Table according to Claim 6, characterized in that
the end pieces (29, 30) include an intermediate

lower housing (31) connected to an upper housing
(32) via a hole (33) fitted in an intermediate

wall (34), the lower housing (31) being adapted
to receive the head (35) of a locking screw, the

shank (37) of which goes through the hole (33) in
the intermediate wall and screws into a clinch

nut (38) which is housed in the upper housing
(32) itself adapted to prevent the rotation of

the nut (38), the shank (37) of the locking screw
being such that, when it is screwed into the nut

(38), its free end comes under the upper wall
(20) of the longitudinal member (8) or cross

member (9) section with the possible
interposition of a bearing plate (39), whereas

the nut (38) forces the end piece (29) against 
the lower wall (24) of the longitudinal member

(8) or cross member (9) section, with a plug (40)
enabling the access hole (36) to be stopped once

the locking screw has been tightened.
Table according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the lower surface (24) of

the longitudinal (8) and cross (9) members is
fitted with a longitudinal groove (41) which

widens towards the inside in order to receive
securing blocks (42) for detachable elements and

to hold them in place.
Table according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the legs (11, 12, 13) are

forcibly fitted into a conical housing (28)
provided in the central part (27) of the corner

pieces (10).
