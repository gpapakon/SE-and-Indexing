<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heterodimer 
composed of factors belonging to a TGF-β superfamily, and a 
composition for treatment of osteopathy containing the 
same. Further, the present invention relates to an 
expression vector which is autonomically replicable in an 
insect cell and contains one or more DNA(s) coding for a 
factor(s) belonging to a TGF-β superfamily, and a method 
for preparing the heterodimer having ectopic bone formation 
activity. M. R. Urist reported that an intramuscular or a 
subcutaneous implant of decalcified bone matrixes induced 
ectopic bone formation [Science, 150, 893 (1965)], and a 
factor of this bone induction activity was named "bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP)" due to its proteinaceous 
factor [M. R. Urist, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 70, 
3511 (1973)]. After the reports, many groups have 
attempted to purify the factor, but the substance had been 
unknown for a long time [A. H. Reddi et al., Proc. Natl. 
Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 69, 1601 (1972); A. H. Reddi. Collagen 
Rel. Res., 1, 209 (1981); T. Takaoka et al., Biomed. Res., 
2, 466 (1981)]. In 1988, J. M. Wozney et al. purified the 
BNP based upon bone-inducing activity invivo, and cloned 
four kinds of genes, human BMP-1, 2A (BMP-2), 2B (BMP-4)  
 
and BMP-3, using probes based on the partial amino acid 
sequence [Science, 242, 1528 (1989)]. Thereafter, their 
group further clarified the structure of BMP-5, 6, 7 and 8 
genes [A. J. Celeste et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 
87, 9843 (1990); J. Cell Biochem. Suppl., 16F, 100 (1992)]. 
Osteogenin of F. P. Luyten et al. [J. Biol. Chem., 264, 
13377 (1989)] is a molecule corresponding to BMP-3, 
osteogenic protein (OP)-1 of T. K. Sampath et al. [J. Biol. 
Chem., 265, 13198 (1990)] to BMP-7, Vgr-1 of K. Lyons et 
al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 86, 4554 (1989)] to 
BMP-6, and mouse Dunn osteosarcoma-derived BMP of H. 
Yoshikawa and K. Takaoka [Jikken Igaku (Experimental 
Medicine), 10, 196 (1992)] to BMP-4, respectively. In order to apply BMP to bone formation, recombinant 
BMP-2 has been prepared in a cultured animal cell. Many factors belonging to the TGF-β superfamily are 
considered to function by processing precursors after 
expression of genes invivo to finally form homodimers. Of 
these factors, inhibins α, βA and βB are known to form, by 
combination thereof, a heterodimer such as inhibin A (the 
heterodimer of α and βA), inhibin B (the heterodimer of α 
and βB) and actibin AB (the heterodimer of βA and βB), in 
addition to a homodimer such as
