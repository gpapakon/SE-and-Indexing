<ABSTRACT>
A multi-paned insulated light (10) such as a window, 
incorporates an interior panel spacer/seal (18) that 

includes a thermal insulating layer of cardboard 
and may 

be used in conjunction with rolled or extruded metal 
spacer forms (22). 

The cardboard spacer (18) can be used 
adjoining either the "cold" pane (12) or the "hot" pane 

(14) of the multi-paned unit (10), or may be interposed 
between adjacent metallic section (26) as a thermal break 

therebetween. The cardboard is preferably sealed with a 
surface sealing layer such as polyvinyl alcohol, to 

preclude gas percolation therepast.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to multi-paned lights, such as windows, and 
in particular to an insulative spacer/seal between adjacent lights incorporating 
a cardboard insulative layer. In the glazing industry the use of multi-paned window lights for use in 
windows, doors, patio doors and the like has grown tremendously, due to the 
greater insulative protection that these provide. However, the problem of thermal bridging is associated with metallic 
spacer/seal sections. Efforts to overcome or substantially diminish the thermal bridging effect 
have included such things as the provision of two metal sections with a 
thermal break barrier therebetween, such as a urethane layer between the metal 
sections. While reasonably thermally efficient, such systems are unduly costly, 
costing in the price range of $1.64 per linear meter of seal length (i.e. $0.50 
per linear foot). Other attempted solutions to the problem have included extruded plastic 
spacer/seals, and other applied and over-extruded thermoplastic thermal 
insulators. However, in addition to expense, such spacer/seals are subject to 
outgassing, which over time can contaminate the enclosed sealed space 
between the panes, with consequent loss of insulative efficiency and optical 
clarity.  One solution to the spacer/seal problems, as set forth in my co-pending 
United States Patent Application Nos. 07/609,336, 07/925,537 and 08/081,530, 
respectively filed November, 5, 1990, August 5, 1992 and June 23, 1993 is the 
use of a hollow cardboard section, wherein utilization is made of the high 
linear insulative value of cardboard. However, I now find that the insulative value of cardboard, with its 
microporous cellular structure, is of such high order that it is possible to use 
an ostensibly solid piece of cardboard as an effective insulating layer in 
conjunction with metal spacer sections, such as existing metal seals. Such a cardboard-composite spacer/seal construction can equal or even 
exceed the thermal performance of the aforementioned expensive composite 
spacer/seal incorporating a urethane thermal barrier, and at significantly lower 
cost, and with increased convenience and facility of use. The possibility of outgassing and/or gas or water vapour migration 
through the cardboard may be effectively precluded by use of polyvinyl 
alcohol as a protective coating or sheath to the cardboard. The incorporation of such a sealing component into the initial making 
of the cardboard also is contemplated, in carrying out the present invention.

<CLAIMS>
A cardboard insulating ribbon of restricted width, 

having a plastic sealing component to preclude 
percolation of fluids therethrough, for use in 

combination with spacer seals in multi-paned glazing 
units, to provide an insulative thermal break between the 

inner faces of adjacent panes of a said unit. 
The insulating ribbon as set forth in Claim 1, 
having a thickness of 14 mill or greater. 
The insulating ribbon as set forth in Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein said plastic sealing component comprises 

polyvinyl alcohol. 
The insulating sealing ribbon as set forth in Claim 
3, wherein said polyvinyl alcohol comprises a surface 

layer. 
The cardboard insulating ribbon as set forth in any 
preceding claim in combination with a spacer/seal for use 

in a multi-paned glazing unit, said ribbon being 
sealingly bonded to at least one side of said 

spacer/seal, to provide an insulative thermal break 
thereto. 
The combination as set forth in Claim 5, said spacer 
 

seal comprising a metallic section. 
The combination as set forth in Claim 6, comprising 
a pair of said metallic sections, having said cardboard 

ribbon sealingly bonded therebetween to provide a 
transverse thermal break between the outer edges of said 

sections. 
The combination as set forth in Claim 5, having two 
of said ribbons bonded in sealing relation to opposed 

outer edges of said spacer/seal, said spacer/seal being 
made up into a frame. 
The combination as set forth in Claim 5, 6 or 7 
combined with a pair of glazing panes, having said 

insulated spacer/seal bonded in sealed, spacing relation 
between said panes. 
The combination as set forth in Claim 9, including 
a second, outer peripheral seal in sealed, enclosing 

relation with said spacer/seal.
