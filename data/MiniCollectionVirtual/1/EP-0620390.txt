<ABSTRACT>
Elastomeric seal ring of large diameter, especially for mounting in a gas-tight flap. To avoid the formation of tears, the cross-section of the seal ring (50) is modified in relation to the cross-section of the duct in such a way that it forms a central foot (53) which rests against the bottom surface (24) of the duct (22) and which is bounded radially by two concave recesses (54, 55). The latter are dimensioned in such a way that they each form a cavity in the duct (22) with the corresponding boundary surfaces (24, 26) (24, 28) of the duct. When the free sealing surface (56) is subjected to load, a significant portion of the elastomeric material can be displaced into these cavities without a significant change in the concave configuration of the recesses (54, 55).

Large-diameter sealing ring made from an elastomer material for 
assembly in an annular duct (22) open to one side, which has a bottom surface 

(24) and two lateral surfaces (26, 28) opposite each other in a radial direction as 
the limiting surfaces, the sealing ring (50) having approximately the same cross-section 

as the duct (22) and an exposed sealing face (56), which faces the open 
side of the duct (22) when the sealing ring (50) is assembled and can be loaded 

on its surface approximately at right angles, 
characterised
 in that the cross-section 
of the sealing ring (50) is modified in comparison with the cross-section of 

the duct in such a way that it forms a central base (53), which rests against the 
bottom surface (24) of the duct (22) and is limited in the radial direction by two 

concave recesses (54, 55), which extend radially from the bottom surface (24) to 
one of the two lateral surfaces (26, 28) and are dimensioned in such a way that 

they form with the corresponding limiting surfaces (24, 26) (24, 28) of the duct a 
cavity in the duct (22), into which a substantial part of the elastomer material can 

be displaced when the exposed sealing face (56) is under load without any 
significant change in the concave design of the recesses (54, 55). 
Sealing ring according to claim 1, characterised in that the concave 
recesses (54, 55) are circular in shape. 
Sealing ring according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
sealing ring (50) rises at right angles from the bottom surface (24) of the duct (22) 

when not under load, forms the concave recesses (54, 55) and rests at right 

angles against the respective lateral surface (26, 28) of the duct (22). 
Sealing ring according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the exposed sealing face (56) is designed as a convex surface, which has a flat 

apex (57) as the contact face for the sealing bead (14).  
 
Sealing ring according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised by two 
lateral annular shoulders (38', 40') facing the open side of the duct (22), which 

rest tightly against corresponding radial, annular projections (34, 36) of the lateral 
surfaces (26, 28) when the sealing ring is assembled.
