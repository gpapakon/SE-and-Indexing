<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to catalyst systems for 
polymerizing alpha-olefins and processes for polymerizing 
alpha-olefins using such catalysts. Chromium-based catalysts are used in the commercial 
polymerization of small alpha-olefins such as ethylene and 
propylene. One such catalyst is prepared by depositing 
chromocene (bis(cyclopentadienyl) chromium (II)) on an 
inorganic metal oxide support, as disclosed in British 
Patent No. 1,253,063 to Karapinka. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,015,059, issued March 29, 1977 to Karol, describes the 
use of bis(indenyl)- and bis(flourenyl)-chromium (II) 
compounds supported on activated inorganic oxide supports as 
catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene. U.S. Patent No. 4,530,914, issued July 23,1985 to Ewen 
et al., discloses a catalyst system for the polymerization 
of alpha-olefins which comprises two or more metallocenes, 
each having different propagation and termination rate 
constants, and aluminoxane. The metallocenes are 
cyclopentadienyl derivatives of a transition metal of 
Group 4b, 5b, and 6b metals of the Periodic Table. They are 
described by the formulas (C5R'm)pR"s(C5R'm)MeQ3-p and 
R"s(C5R'm)2MeQ' where (C5R'm) is a cyclopentadienyl or  
 
substituted cyclopentadienyl, each R' is hydrogen or a 
hydrocarbyl radical, R" is an alkylene radical, a dialkyl 
germanium or silicon or an alkyl phosphine or amine radical 
bridging two (C5R'm) rings, Q is a hydrocarbon radical, Me 
is a Group 4b, Sb, or 6b metal, s is 0 or 1, p is 0, 1, 
or 2; when p=0, s=0; m is 4 when s is 1 and m is 5 when s 
is 0. U.S. Patent No. 4,939,217, issued July 3, 1990 to Stricklen, 
also discloses a process for polymerizing olefins where the 
polymerization is conducted in the presence of hydrogen, and 
a catalyst system is used which contains aluminoxane and at 
least two metallocenes, each having different olefin 
polymerization termination rate constants. The metallocenes 
disclosed are similar to those described in aforementioned 
U.S. Patent No. 4,530,914. U.S. Patent No. 4,975,403, issued December 4, 1990 to Ewen, 
discloses a catalyst system for use in the polymerization of 
olefins. The catalyst system includes at least two 
different chiral, stereo-rigid metallocene catalysts of the 
formula R"(C5(R')4)2MeQp (where Me is a Group 4b, 5b or 6b 
metal and (C5(R')4) is a cyclopentadienyl or substituted 
cyclopentadienyl ring) and an aluminum compound. Canadian Patent Application No. 2,000,567, published 
April 13, 1990, discloses a process for producing 
polyethylene
