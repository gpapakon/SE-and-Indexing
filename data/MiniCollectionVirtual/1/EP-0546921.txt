<ABSTRACT>
Gas photonanograph for the manufacture and optical analysis of patterns on a nanometre scale. The photonanograph comprises a gas decompression chamber (10) equipped with means (12) for feeding gas intended for the manufacture of the patterns and provided at a first end with microcapillaries (24) intended for the gas exit, an optical fibre (28) blunted (26) at a first end, intended to be placed facing the sample (18) to be treated, a source of light (30) coupled to the second end (28a) of the optical fibre, the latter being transparent to the light emitted by the source, means (38, 52) for detecting and means (50) for processing the luminous signal reflected by the sample. This device makes possible the localized deposition or etching of materials for microelectronics or microoptoelectronics.
