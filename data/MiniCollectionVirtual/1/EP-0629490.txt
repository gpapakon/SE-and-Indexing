<ABSTRACT>
Process for manufacturing a product made of a thermoplastic (thermofusible) or thermosetting polymer, comprising zones sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave region, characterised in that, combined with the polymer, is an additive that is able to react, this being in the form of a finely divided powder or deposit constituting dipoles sensitive to the action of the electromagnetic radiation in the microwave region. Product made of a thermoplastic or thermosetting polymer comprising zones sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave region, characterised in that it is obtained by the implementation of the process.
