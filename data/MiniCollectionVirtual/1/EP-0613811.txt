<ABSTRACT>
Running gear for a rail vehicle is proposed which has at least two wheel sets with radial adjustability, by means of link arrangements (14, 16, 20, 22, 34, 35, 46, 47), between the wheel set bearings/axle bearing housings (5, 10, 40, 41) and compensation levers (19, 30, 42) which serve to couple both wheel sets. At least one damping element (26, 36, 48) is provided between a compensation lever (19, 30, 42) and a link arrangement (14, 16, 20, 22, 34, 35, 46, 47).

<CLAIMS>
Running gear for a railway vehicle, having at 
least two wheel sets with radial adjustability by means 

of link arrangements (14, 16, 20, 22, 34, 35, 46, 47) 
between the wheel-set bearings/axle-bearing housings (5, 

10, 40, 41) and compensating levers (19, 30, 42) serving 
to couple both wheel sets, characterized in that, in the 

case of link arrangements in a tandem type of 
construction having wheel-set links (14, 20) between 

wheel-set bearings/axle-bearing housings (5, 10) and 
bogie frame (2) as well as connecting links (16, 22) 

between wheel-set links (14, 20) and compensating lever 
(19), at least one damping element (26) is arranged 

between compensating lever (19) and connecting link (22). 
Running gear according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the damping elements (26, 36) of the right-hand 

and left-hand bogie side are fitted in such a way as to 
act in opposite directions. 
Running gear according to Claim 1 and/or 2, 
characterized in that a damping element having a friction 

characteristic is used. 
Running gear according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that a damping element having force 

limitation is used.
