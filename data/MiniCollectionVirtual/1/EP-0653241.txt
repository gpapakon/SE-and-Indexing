<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally fibers to 
have provided with a polymeric coating and more 
particularly to fibers with an ultrathin polymer layer 
applied thereto. This application is a continuation-in-part of an 
application entitled Method and Apparatus for Applying 
Polymeric Coating, United States Serial No. 07/582,691 
filed September 14, 1990, now U. S. Patent No.           It is known in the art to prepare free standing, 
pinhole-free ultrathin films suitable for separatory 
applications. In United States Patent No. 4,880,699 to 
Kohn there is disclosed and claimed, for example, a 
method of preparing thin polyimide films. Such films are 
prepared by dissolving the polymer in a solvent, casting 
the solution on water, and evaporating the solvent. The 
film so formed can then be readily removed from the 
water's surface. A free standing film fabricated in accordance with 
the foregoing may be difficult to incorporate into 
commercially attractive structures, for example, into a 
hollow fiber membrane module useful for gas separation. 
One alternative approach might be to dip-coat hollow 
microporous fibers. Such a method, however, would 
undoubtedly have the disadvantage that the polymer  
 
the coating. Another possibility for applying thin, 
continuous cast membranes to a hollow fiber would be 
mechanical wrapping. This method is arduous at best, and 
coating thicknesses and film quality would largely be 
determined in the casting step. In Japanese laid-open application No. 63-104618 of 
Kawada et al. there is disclosed a method of producing 
hollow fiber composite membranes. The method shown 
involves continuously casting a thin film on water and 
passing a microporous hollow fiber through the polymer 
solution in a region where the polymer/solvent solution 
possesses fluidity. The solution deposits a thin film on 
the membrane while excess polymer is taken up and stored. 
The system utilized by Kawada et al. does not address the 
issues of depositing a thin film uniformly about the 
periphery of a hollow fiber as would be required for high 
quality separation membranes. Moreover, significant 
control and recycling of polymer would be required, 
making the system difficult to automate or even produce 
commercially suitable product.  In accordance with the present invention, fibers 
are coated by providing a polymer solution to the surface 
of a liquid bath to form a polymeric layer on the surface 
of the bath thereby creating a film, and drawing a fiber 
therethrough. The polymer
