<ABSTRACT>
Nonhygroscopic crystal of aureobasidin A, and a process for producing nonhygroscopic aureobasidin A by dissolving noncrystalline 
aureobasidin A in a neutral fat or a polyethylene glycol, followed by deposition therefrom. The obtained crystal is nonhygroscopic 

unlike the conventional noncrystalline powder and is suited for preparing pharmaceuticals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-hygroscopic 
crystal of aureobasidin A which are useful 
as an antifungal agent, and a process for production 
thereof. Aureobasidin A (identical with the novel 
antibiotic R106-I; hereinafter referred to as R106-I) is 
an antibiotic produced by a strain belonging to Genus 
Aureobasidium (international deposit number: FERM-BP1938), 
and its usefulness as an antifungal agent is 
expected (JP-A-2-138296, JP-A-3-22995). R106-I is a 
cyclic peptide having a molecular weight of 1,101. Up 
to today, this substance has been available as an 
amorphous white-colored powder. This amorphous white-colored powder is 
hygroscopic. Generally speaking, the content of active 
ingredient in a pharmaceutical preparation must be kept 
constant. When the active ingredient is hygroscopic, 
the process for production of pharmaceutical preparation 
would be difficult to control because the water content 
of the active ingredient must be kept always constant 
and the like. For this reason, active ingredient is  
 
required to be non-hygroscopic. However, R106-I is a 
cyclic polypeptide difficult to crystallize, and it is 
available only as an amorphous hygroscopic powder. In the course of studying the physico-chemical 
properties of R106-I, the present inventors have found 
that naturally occurring neutral fatty oils (vegetable 
oils), synthetic and semi-synthetic neutral fatty oils 
or polyethylene glycols which is a liquid state at 
ordinary temperature are, even though these substances 
are not used as a solvent in the conventional 
crystallization processes, as good solvents for the 
amorphous R106-I, and that a crystal prepared by 
dissolving R106-I in these solvents followed by 
deposition of crystal is non-hygroscopic unlike the so 
far known amorphous powder and has a good purity. Based 
on these findings, the present invention has been 
accomplished. Thus, the first aspect of the present 
invention relates to a non-hygroscopic crystal of 
R106-I. This crystalline powder exhibits an 
endothermic peak due to a rapid melting usually between 
about 200°C and about 206°C as determined by 
differential thermal analysis, though the peak 
temperature may somewhat vary depending on purity.  The second aspect of the present invention 
relates to a process for producing the above-mentioned 
non-hygroscopic crystal of R106-I. This process of 
production is characterized by dissolving R106-I in a 
neutral fatty oil or polyethylene glycol and depositing 
a crystal of R106-I from the solution.
