<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with support from the United States
Government under Research Grant No. 5 RO1 NS25656-02 awarded
by the National Institutes of Health. The United States
Government has certain rights in this invention.This invention relates generally to radioactive compounds
which are useful as radiopharmaceuticals, and more particularly,
to radioiodinated benzovesamicol analogs which selectively
localize in presynaptic cholinergic neurons.Alzheimer's disease, which is often characterized by the
degeneration of the cholinergic nerves, is increasingly
prevalent as the mean age of the American population increases.
It has been estimated that there are approximately
between 5 and 6 million persons in the United States afflicted
with Alzheimer's disease.It would be highly desirable to be able to image cholinergic
nerves to assess the extent and regional pattern of nerve
damage in Alzheimer patients. Moreover, such brain imaging
would be useful for diagnosing and monitoring patients with
rarer neurological disorders, such as olivopontocerebellar
atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and patients demented
by Parkinson's disease.In the present state of the art, patients with Alzheimer's
disease and related neurological disorders, are being imaged
with radiopharmaceuticals which are indicators of brain blood
flow or brain metabolism. Positron emission tomography (PET)
studies have revealed that patients with clinically diagnosed
Alzheimer's disease have reduced metabolism and perfusion,
particularly in the posterior parietal and in the frontal
regions of the brain. Moreover, PET studies have demonstrated
that a significant increase in right/left metabolic asymmetry 
is associated with predominantly lateralized neuropsychological
deficits.Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion
studies of regional blood flow have been done with a xenon-133
inhalation method and with intravenous administration of N-isopropyl-123I
iodoamphetamine. More recently, technetium-99m
hexamethylpropylenamine oxime has been utilized as a tracer
for SPECT studies inasmuch as it crosses the blood-brain
barrier and is completely cleared from the blood in a single
passage through the cerebral circulation so that regional
distribution is proportionate to regional blood flow.The known radiotracers for brain imaging are lipophilic, and
therefore move across the blood-brain barrier with nearly
complete extraction during a single pass through the cerebral
circulation. Once inside, however, these radiotracers bind to
no
