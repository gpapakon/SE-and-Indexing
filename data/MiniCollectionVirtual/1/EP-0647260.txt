<ABSTRACT>
Described are liquid to pasty washing and cleaning agents containing anionic or anionic and non-ionic surfactants in quantities from 20 to 70 % by wt., and including as anionic surfactants 2 to 25 % by wt. of sulphonated fatty-acid glycerin esters. Such washing and cleaning agents suffer no loss in washing performance compared with liquid to pasty washing- and cleaning-agent formulations usually containing surfactants. The invention enables alkylbenzene sulphonates to be completely or at least partly replaced. Preferred agents contain as anionic surfactants a mixture of sulphonated fatty-acid glycerin esters, fatty-alkyl sulphate and fatty-acid soaps or a mixture of sulphonated fatty-acid glycerin esters, alkane sulphonate and fatty-acid soaps.

A detergent in liquid to paste-like form containing 
anionic and nonionic surfactants, characterized 

in that the surfactant content of the detergent 
is 20 to 70% by weight, sulfonated fatty acid glycerol 

esters being present as anionic surfactants in quantities 
of 2 to 25% by weight and nonionic surfactants being present in quantities of 10 to 65 % by weight. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that it contains 5 to 20% by weight of sulfonated fatty 

acid glycerol esters obtained from fatty acid glycerol 
esters with iodine values below 5, preferably from mono-, 

di- and triglycerides or mixtures thereof with iodine 
value below 5, which contain fatty acids with 6 to 22 

carbon atoms, by reaction with gaseous sulfur trioxide 
and subsequent neutralization with aqueous bases. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that it contains mono- and/or polyhydric 

alcohols with 1 to 6 carbon atoms in quantities of 2 to 
20% by weight and preferably 5 to 15% by weight as 

organic solvents. 3 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it contains 20 to 65% by weight of 

liquid nonionic surfactants and water in quantities of 0 
to 5% by weight. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it contains 

10 to 35% by weight and preferably 20 to 
35% by weight of nonionic surfactants and 20 to 55% by 

weight, preferably 25 to 45% by weight and more preferably 
28 to 40% by weight of water. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it is free from alkylbenzenesulfonates.  

 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that it contains alkylsulfates, preferably 

fatty alkylsulfates, alkanesulfonates, soap or 
mixtures thereof as further anionic surfactants. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that it contains 0.5 to 8% by weight and 

preferably 1 to 5% by weight of alkyl glycoside. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 and 
5 to 8, characterized in that it contains 15 to 35% by 

weight of a mixture of sulfonated fatty acid glycerol 
esters and other anionic surfactants, more particularly 

soap, in a ratio by weight of 1:3 to 3:1 and 10 to 20% by 
weight of a primary C
12-18
 fatty alcohol containing on 
average 1 to 12 moles of ethylene oxide. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3 and 
5 to 8, characterized in that it contains 15 to 35% by 

weight of a mixture of sulfonated fatty acid glycerol 
esters and other anionic surfactants in a ratio by weight 

of 1:3 to 3:1, 22 to 32% by weight of a primary C
12-18
 
fatty alcohol containing on average 1 to 12 moles of 

ethylene oxide and 5 to 17% by weight of monohydric 
and/or polyhydric alcohols containing 2 to 4 carbon 

atoms. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 9 or 10, characterized 
in that it contains a mixture of sulfonated fatty 

acid glycerol esters, fatty alkylsulfate and fatty acid 
soaps or a mixture of sulfonated fatty acid glycerol 

esters, alkanesulfonate and fatty acid soaps as anionic 
surfactants.
