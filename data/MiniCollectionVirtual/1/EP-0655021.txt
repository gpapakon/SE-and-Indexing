<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the laser beam cutting of strip or plate workpieces at high speed, especially over 100 m/min. The laser beam melts the workpiece with the formation of a vapour capillary at the cutting point and the melt is driven off by a cutting gas consisting of an inert gas/hydrogen mixture. In order to maintain the vapour capillary, the hydrogen component of the cutting gas mixture is set so high and this cutting gas mixture is taken to the surface of the melt at the cutting point at such a pressure and with such a pressure distribution that the temperature at the surface of the melt is kept at boiling point and the melt is continuously driven out of the cutting seam on the side away from the cutting direction of the vapour capillary.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the laser beam cutting of strip-shaped or 
sheet-shaped workpieces, more particularly electric quality sheet 

having a thickness of 
<
 1 mm, more particularly 
<
 0.5 mm, wherein 
a laser beam emitted from a laser beam source connects the 

material at the cutting place with the formation of a vapour 
capillary, the melt being expelled by a hydrogen-containing inert 

cutting gas, characterized in that to maintain the vapour 
capillary, the hydrogen component of the cutting gas is adjusted 

through such a level, and the inert cutting gas enclosing the 
laser beam is supplied to the surface of the melt at the cutting 

place at a pressure such and a pressure distribution such that 
the vapour capillary remains closed at the bottom, the 

temperature at the surface of the melt is maintained at 
evaporating temperature and the melt is continuously expelled 

from the cutting joint on the side of the vapour capillary remote 
from the cutting direction. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
cutting gas contains a proportion of up to 25% by volume 

hydrogen. 
A process according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in that 
if the laser beam source used is a CO
2
 laser, the pressure of the 
cutting gas mixture is adjusted between 3 bar and 8 bar.  

 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that if the laser beam source used is an Nd:YAG laser, the 

pressure of the cutting gas mixture is adjusted to up to 50 bar. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the cutting gas is nitrogen or argon. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the cutting gas is guided eccentrically of the laser beam 

axis and impinges with a lead on the cutting place. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that the cutting gas impinges on the cutting place at an angle of 


<
 90Â°. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the laser beam is focused on an oval focal spot with main 

axis extending in the cutting direction. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in 
that the focused focal spot of the laser beam is maintained at 

half the height of the workpiece. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the laser beam emitted from a laser beam source is of low 

mode order. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that the melt is also expelled from the cutting joint  

 
downstream of the vapour capillary by an additional gaseous, 

liquid or particulate beam.
