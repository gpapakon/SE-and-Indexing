A process for the preparation of tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone
of high purity by the action of chlorine and

concentrated hydrochloric acid on hydroquinone, which
comprises introducing a part of the hydroquinone to be

employed into an initially introduced 4- to 6-fold molar
amount - based on the total amount of hydroquinone - of

20 to 37 % aqueous hydrochloric acid containing catalytic
amounts of iron(III) ions and an anionic dispersant,

introducing 1.5 to 2.0 times the molar amount - based on
total hydroquinone - of chlorine as a gas into this solution

at a temperature of 20 to 90°C, then adding the
residual amount of hydroquinone as a solid or in dissolved

form, introducing 1.5 to 2.0 times the molar
amount of chlorine as a gas, keeping the concentration of

the hydrochloric acid here at 23-25 % by addition of
water and finally raising the temperature to 100 to 107°C

with further introduction of chlorine as a gas (1.7 to

2.5 times the molar amount) and dilution with water to a
hydrochloric acid concentration of 20 to 22 %.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein 30 to
70%, in particular 40 to 60 %, preferably 45 to 55%, of

the hydroquinone to be employed is initially introduced.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
the aqueous hydrochloric acid employed is 22 to 28 %

strength, in particular 23 to 25 % strength.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims
1 to 3, wherein chlorine is introduced as a gas at a

temperature of 40 to 90°C, in particular 50 to 80°C.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 
1 to 4, wherein the residual amount of hydroquinone is

added as a 10 to 20 % strength, in particular 15-18 %
strength, aqueous solution.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims
1 to 5, wherein the temperature in the third introduction

of chlorine as a gas is raised to 103 to 106°C, in
particular 104 to 105°C.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims
1 to 6, wherein the chlorination is carried out in the

course of 5 to 15 hours, in particular 8.5 to 10.5 hours.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims
1 to 7, wherein the isolated chloranil is additionally

subjected to a subsequent treatment with boiling water.
