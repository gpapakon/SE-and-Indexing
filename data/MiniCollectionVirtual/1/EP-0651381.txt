<ABSTRACT>
Presented is a medium for optical data storage which can be used, 
e.g., as a microfiche, a microfilm or an optical card and comprises a 

substrate and a layer including a liquid crystalline polymer. The LCP 
layer having a thickness (h), information is recorded using a laser 

having a focus width below 0.5 h. The LCP layer has an absorption 
coefficient (α) which relates to the reciprocal value of the thickness 

(h) of the layer as 0.5/h ≦ α ≦ 2/h. Preferably, the absorption 
coefficient is approximately equal to the reciprocal value of the 

thickness of the layer. The medium for optical data storage thus 
allows an increase in the writing speed and/or a reduction of the 

required laser power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a medium for optical data storage comprising 
a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) and to a method of storing 
information. Optical storage media are known, both for analog storage, e.g., 
microfiches, microfilms, optical cards, and for digital data storage, 
e.g., compact discs. It is also known to employ LCPs in optical data 
storage, and such media are known to comprise a substrate carrying a 
layer of the LCP, which layer is recordable by means of a laser. In this respect EP-A-0 474 473 discloses a process and apparatus for 
manufacturing optical storage devices wherein a film of liquid crystal 
material, such as a liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) is deposited on a 
substrate. LCP material can be used for thermo-optical and photo-optical 
storage media. For LCP materials which have a glass transition 
temperature Tg above ambient, localized heating by a laser beam 
produces an optically clear written spot or line resulting from rapid 
cooling of the written material into the glass phase, so that the 
clear isotropic texture is quenched into the solid glass phase. 
Aligned LCP materials which have a Tg below ambient adopt a scattering 
texture when locally heated by a laser beam. The LCP material does not 
require the application thereto of an electric field in order to 
produce a scattering texture or clear lines or spots, so that it is 
possible to make a device without electrodes, which results in a 
simple construction. The object of EP-A-0 474 473 is to provide a 
process and an apparatus for mass producing such optical storage 
devices.  The Proceedings of the 4th Brite-EuRam Conference, Seville May 25-27, 
1992, include an article by G.R. Möhlmann, "Erasable polymeric media 
for analog information storage and retrieval (P-2119)." This article 
relates to a dyed, side chain liquid crystal polymeric, optical 
storage medium. The recording mechanism of this storage medium is 
based on diode laser initiated, thermo-optical, liquid-crystalline-multidomain-to-isotropic 
(scattering to clear) phase transitions. The 
temperature required for the nematic to isotropic phase change process 
at the so-called "clearing temperature (Tc)" is achieved by the 
conversion of absorbed photon energy (by the dye molecules) into heat. 
In this article optical storage films are presented which have a 
substrate of a 100 µm thick polyester film on which a 3-7 µm thick 
active polymer recording layer was deposited. These films were tested 
to select the optimal polymer system (absorption, Tg,
