<ABSTRACT>
An electronic delay circuit for firing an ignition 
element (18). The delay circuit includes a capacitor 

(15) which stores electric energy supplied from an 
electric blasting machine (1), an oscillator (92) 

generating a clock pulse train, a circuit (70) for 
over-exciting the oscillator, a counter (50) which 

counts clock pulses of the clock pulse train, and a 
circuit (40) for maintaining a reset state of the 

counter for a predetermined time period after the 

electric energy is supplied. The counter (50) 
produces a trigger signal when it counts a 

predetermined number of the clock pulses, and the 
electric energy stored in the capacitor (15) is 

discharged to the ignition element (18). Since the 
oscillator (92) enters into the steady state in a very 

short time by the over-excitation, the delay circuit 
has large resistance to external noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
delay circuit for firing an ignition element, which
stores electric energy supplied from an electric
blasting machine, and fires at high accuracy a
detonator following a predetermined delay.A method for controlling ground vibrations so as
to minimize the effect of blasting on nearby
structures in a multi-step blasting system is proposed
by Japanese Patent Application Laying-open No.
285800/1989. This application teaches the accuracy of
a delay time interval for sequentially firing
detonators in order to reduce the ground vibrations.
According to the application, it is preferable that
the delay time interval t and the standard deviation σ
of the delay time interval t satisfy the following
relationship:
t/σ ≥ 10
The application states that unless the condition is
satisfied, the ground vibrations may not be reduced.Consequently, in order to set the delay time
interval for firing detonators at 10 ms, the standard
deviation of the delay time must be equal or less than
1 ms. Likewise, the delay time interval of 5 ms
requires the standard deviation of 0.5 ms or less.Japanese Patent Application Publication No.
53479/1988 discloses an electric detonator fired by an 
electronic delay circuit. This circuit receives only
electric energy via leading wires, activates a digital
timer comprising a quartz or ceramic oscillator, and
fires an electric detonator after a predetermined
delay time. The application, however, does not
teaches a technique to satisfy the condition of
equation (1).U. S. Patent No. 4,445,435 teaches an electronic
delay circuit in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, which comprises a means for
storing electric energy, an oscillating circuit using
a quartz or ceramic oscillator, a digital timer
including a counter and a counter reset circuit for
resetting the counter, and a means for firing an
electric detonator after a predetermined delay time.Likewise, EP-A
261,886 discloses a delay circuit for electrically
firing a detonating primer (detonator).Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the principle of a delay
circuit disclosed by EP-A 261 886.
In this figure, an electric blaster (electric blasting
machine) 1 supplies a voltage (electric energy) as
shown at (a) of Fig. 2. The electric energy is
supplied to an actuation circuit 2, a capacitor 3, a
clock pulse generator 4 and a counting circuit 5 via
leading wires 6, and is stored into the capacitor 3 as
shown at (b) of Fig. 2. The actuation circuit 2
maintains the reset state of the counting circuit 5
during
