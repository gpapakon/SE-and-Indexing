<ABSTRACT>
Convergence angle information and image 
information of video cameras is transmitted from a 

multi-eye image-taking apparatus having two video 
cameras through a recording medium to a displaying 

apparatus. A convergence angle of display units in the 
displaying apparatus is controlled in accordance with 

the convergence angle information of the video cameras, 
permitting an observer to observe natural images. 

Since the convergence angle information is made ahead 
of the image information, the convergence angle of the 

display units can be changed with a natural feeling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
display system which can take and/or
display a stereoscopic image or a wide image. More
particularly, the invention relates to an image
display system provided with a multi-eye
camera apparatus having a plurality of camera units and
a displaying device which can permit an observer to
observe an enlarged screen of virtual images of taken
images through a compact display unit mounted on the
observer's head.Recently used to obtain camera images close to
the human vision are stereoscopic image taking
apparatus which can obtain camera images by taking
images of an object in a same direction, for example,
through two camera units. As described in Japanese
Laid-open Patent Application No. JP-A-62-122493, a
conventional stereoscopic image taking apparatus
employs a stereoscopic image taking and focusing method
for tracking an intersection between lens optical axes
of two video cameras (hereinafter referred to as
cameras) and performing focusing, based on a base
length and an angle between the two cameras. There are also various proposals of
stereoscopic image displaying apparatus for displaying
images taken by such multi-eye cameras. Among these
stereoscopic image displaying apparatus is a so-called
head-mounted display (hereinafter referred to as HMD),
which is a display apparatus which can permit the
observer to observe an enlarged screen of virtual
images of taken images through a compact display unit
mounted on the observer's head.As for the image taking and/or displaying
system mainly composed of the multi-eye camera and the
HMD, there are proposed image taking and/or displaying
systems, which are different from the prior art systems
simply for taking and appreciating scenic images. Such
systems are disclosed, for example, in United States
Patents No. US-A-2,711,594, No. US-A-3,205,303, and No.
US-A-3,670,097. In the systems, a sensor for detecting a
moving direction of the observer's face is provided in
the HMD, information about the moving direction is sent
from the sensor to a control unit for controlling the
camera posture, and a taking field of camera is changed
so as to track the moving direction of the observer's
face. According to this arrangement, when the observer
simply changes the face into a desired direction, the
camera is directed in the direction and sends an image
of the external field in that direction as a camera
signal to the HMD on the observer whereby the observer 
can observe the image in that direction.As one close to the above system there
