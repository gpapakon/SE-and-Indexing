Pressure regulation device for a hydraulic system 
comprising at least one generator (30) of fluid under 

pressure, a brake actuator (28) and a reservoir (32) of 
fluid under low pressure, and including a proportional 

electrovalve controlled by a computer, the electrovalve 
being connected via a duct (29) to the generator (30) of 

fluid under pressure and via a duct (31) to the brake 
actuator (28), and comprising in a casing (8) an electrical 

coil (10) and a sliding magnetic core (12) controlling 
a slide valve (16) sliding in a bore provided in a 

body (18), the slide valve (16) determining two chambers 
(22, 40) arranged on either side of the slide valve (16) 

and being formed with a valve (48) with ball (50) 
co-operating with a seating (52) formed on the casing 

(8), the slide valve (16) being formed with a groove (34) 
delimited by two bearing surfaces (36, 38), one of the 

bearing surfaces (36) co-operating with the duct (31) for 
connection with the brake actuator (28) and having a 

length (L) greater than the diameter (D) of that duct by 
a length (R) representing a functional overlap. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the two chambers (22, 40) arranged on either side of 

the slide valve (16) communicate with one another via an 
axial drilling (42) made in the slide valve (16). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the valve (16) is displaceable in three positions, 

an isolation position where the duct (31) for connection 
to the brake actuator (28) is closed off, a release 

position where that duct (31) is connected to the low 
pressure reservoir (32) and an admission position where 

the duct (31) is connected to the generator (30) of fluid 
under pressure. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the release and admission positions are capable of 

modulation.
