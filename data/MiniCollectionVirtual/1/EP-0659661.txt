<ABSTRACT>
A conveyance member for materials having virtually fluid 
behaviour inside channels (10) 

comprises a cable (11), formed from polyester fibres, and 
a plurality of conveyance elements (12) radially 

projecting from the cable (11) and spaced along its axis 
and directly moulded in position on the cable (11). The 

external surface of the cable has a sheath of polyurethane (14) 
on which 

the conveyance elements (12) are provided in thermoplastic 
polyurethane to achieve a permanent constraint between the 

different component parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cable equipped with 
elements extending radially to its axis and designed for 
conveyance of materials having virtually fluid behaviour 
inside of tubular ducts in which runs said cable. In the known art conveyor cables of the above type and 
whose conveyance elements consisting of discs or 
equivalent elements are provided either by moulding of 
plastic material directly on the cable or by means of 
fastening of elements provided separately are used. The 
cables employed are either the metallic type or the 
high-strength textile fibre chord type. The metallic cables have the advantage of exhibiting high 
tensile strength characteristics against mechanical 
stresses and ensure good anchoring of the conveyance 
elements due virtually to the roughness of their surface 
structure which is generally provided with three strands 
wrapped around a central core. But said cables exhibit the shortcoming of being 
relatively stiff which necessitates the provision of 
systems with a curve radius sufficiently great to avoid 
excessive bending stress. Another shortcoming of metallic 
cables is high resistance to torsion preventing the 
conveyance elements from positioning themselves along the 
duct in a manner adapted to the geometry of the curves, 
the position of the idling pulleys and any dissymmetry of  
 
said conveyance elements and of the material conveyed. By comparison textile fibre cables have the advantage of 
obviating the above said shortcomings of poor flexibility 
typical of metallic cables but on the other hand exhibit 
less grip for the conveyance elements and, above all, have 
a marked tendency to ravel because of surface strand 
breakage due to mechanical stress and wear. This 
shortcoming is usually avoided by covering the cable with 
a protective sheath of flexible material. But in this 
manner anchoring ability due to friction of the conveyance 
elements is reduced. There have been proposed various solutions for the problem 
of anchorage of the conveyance elements on sheathed cables 
by means of change of the cross section of the cable 
opposite the conveyance elements to be formed as described 
in EP 156.419 and EP 145.055 in the name of this 
applicant. Again in the name of the present applicant 
another proposed solution to the problem is described in 
EP 392.580 where the conveyance element is moulded around 
a nail inserted radially in the cable. The increase in safety standards and construction costs of 
the systems leads however to the consideration that
