<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display comprising a layer of 
superposed front (5) and rear (6,6') polarising elements, 

liquid crystal material (3) and means (4) for selectively 
energising the material to define variable indicia. The 

display may be a twisted nematic display with two parallel 
polarisers (5,6) separated by a liquid crystal layer, or a 

Heilmeir display with a single fixed polariser and a 
polarising liquid crystal layer. Fixed indicia (8,71) are 

defined by one of the polarising elements or are provided 
(22) between the liquid crystal material and the rear 

polariser.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to liquid crystal displays. It is a common requirement with liquid crystal 
displays to provide certain "fixed" information such as 
lettering/scales etc on the display for use in conjunction 
with the variable data defined by the display elements. 
Conventionally, the fixed information on negative mode 
displays has been provided by printing on the front face of 
the liquid crystal display or on the back of a glass 
situated in front of the LCD. However, one of the problems 
with this arrangement is that in order to view the display 
correctly under certain conditions, for example at night, 
it is necessary to illuminate the LCD from the front in 
order to view the fixed information while the LCD is also 
lit from the back to allow the variable information to be 
seen. This is particularly complex. In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, a liquid crystal display comprises a layer of 
superposed front and rear polarizing elements, a liquid 
crystal material and means for selectively energising the 
material to define variable indicia, wherein one of the 
polarising elements defines further, fixed indicia visible 
from the front of the display. In this aspect of the invention, we have provided an 
alternative to the conventional system of printing the 
fixed information on the front of the LCD by causing one of 
the polarising elements to define the shapes of the 
required, fixed information. Typically, this would be 
achieved by laying down one of the polarising elements in 
a continuous form and then selectively removing parts of 
the polarising element to define the required shapes. 
Alternatively, the polarising element could be provided in 
the shaped form. In a first embodiment, the display is a conventional 
negative mode twisted nematic (T.N.) display with two 
parallel polarisers, separated by a liquid crystal layer. 
The first polariser polarises light in a particular  
 
direction (eg. horizontal), the liquid crystal layer (in 
its normal, deactivated state) rotates the angle of 
polarisation of the light by 90°, and therefore the light 
is blocked by the second, horizontal polariser. When the 
liquid crystal layer is activated (by applying a voltage 
across it), it loses this property, and the light passes 
through the parallel polarisers unhindered. Typically, the 
rear polariser has cut-away portions which allow light to 
pass through, whether or not the element is activated. 
This provides fixed white indicia on a black background 
(i.e. a negative
