<ABSTRACT>
A spool valve for use in the piston (12) of a gas spring to allow 
compressed gas to be transferred to extend or retract the spring 

comprises a tubular sleeve (18) which is a composite of two 
identical complementary interlocking sleeve sections (18A, 18B), 

each of which has one flat end surrounded by a base flange (32) and 
the other end formed with diametrically opposite projecting steps 

(34) between diametrically opposite receiving steps (36), so that 
when the two parts are fitted together, gas ports (38) are formed 

between the respective steps. These ports can be partly occluded 
by hinged flaps (40), which allow gas to flow in one direction 

through the valve faster than in the other direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas springs, which generally comprise 
sealed piston and cylinder assemblies charged with gas under 
pressure on either side of the piston. If a manually operated 
valve is provided to allow gas to pass from one side of the piston 
to the other, such gas springs can be used as stepless height 
adjusters for chairs, tables, computer consoles and the like. Because of the volume occupied by the piston rod on one side of the 
piston, retraction of such gas springs reduces their total internal 
volume and therefore increases their internal gas pressure. If the 
gas transfer valve is opened and no load is put on the spring, it 
will naturally extend fully. If the gas spring is used as a height 
adjustable support, the relation between internal gas pressure and 
piston rod diameter would normally be chosen so that a 
pre-determined load on the spring when the valve is opened will be 
sufficient to retract the spring. The work done is of course 
stored as increased gas pressure and is available to extend the 
spring later, against a maximum load that depends on the piston rod 
area and gas pressure, when the valve is opened. Gas transfer between the two ends of the cylinder is often 
accomplished through a surrounding gas jacket, with the transfer 
valve being located at one end of the cylinder. However, 
alternative arrangements have been proposed from time to time, and 
these include the location of the transfer valve in the piston 
itself.  One example of such a proposal is to be found in European patent 
No 0277298. This describes a transfer valve housing with a 
longitudinal passage communicating with the closed end of the 
cylinder and with a lateral vent communicating with the piston rod 
end of the cylinder, and a valve spool in the housing which can be 
operated to open the valve by means of a push rod passing down the 
centre of the piston rod. The design considerations for a valve of this nature will include 
manufacturing costs, including minimising the number of operations 
required (such as moulding and drilling); the gas leakage that may 
arise at surface discontinuities, such as where mould halves are 
separated; and tooling costs, including minimising the numbers of 
different parts. The present invention is concerned with a valve suitable for use as 
a gas transfer valve in a gas spring piston which takes the 
foregoing considerations into account. The invention concerns aspects of the valve described below. The 
scope of the invention extends to all novel aspects of

<CLAIMS>
A valve housing having a continuous flow path therethrough, 
said flow path having a longitudinal part and a lateral part, the 

longitudinal part comprising a passage (31) extending from one end 
of the valve housing (18) to the interior thereof within a 

surrounding wall (30) and the lateral part comprising a vent (38) 
extending outwardly from the interior of the valve housing through 

the said wall; characterised in that the valve housing is formed of 
two complementary abutting tubular sections (18A, 18B), at least 

one of which has a stepped end (36) where it abuts an end (34) of 
the other, wherein a gap (38) between the abutting ends defines the 

vent. 
A valve housing according to claim 1 further characterised in 
that both sections (18A, 18B) have circumferentially stepped ends 

(34, 36) where they abut each other, and the steps interlock. 
A valve housing according to claim 2, further characterised 
in that the two sections (18A, 18B) are identical to each other. 
A valve housing according to any one of the preceding claims 
further characterised by a variable flow restrictor (40) whereby 

inward and outward fluid flows through the vent (38) are 
differently moderated. 
A valve housing according to claim 4 further characterised in 
that the variable flow restrictor comprises an obstruction (40) 

displaceable by flowing fluid, wherein the degree of displacement 
depends upon the direction of fluid flow through the valve housing. 
A valve housing according to claim 5 further characterised in 
that the obstruction comprises a hinged flap (40). 
A fluid flow control valve comprising a valve housing (18) 
and a valve member (20) therein which is movable between an open 

 
disposition in which fluid may flow along a flow path through the 

valve body and a closed disposition in which the flow path is shut 
off; characterised in that the valve housing is as claimed in any 

one of claims 1 to 6. 
A fluid flow control valve according to claim 7, further 
characterised in that the valve is a spool valve in which a spool 

(20) is displaceable axially within a sleeve (18A, 18B). 
A gas spring comprising a pressurised piston and cylinder 
assembly (11, 12, 14) and a gas flow control valve (18, 20) in the 

piston (12) to control gas flow through the piston from one end of 
the cylinder (11) to the other; characterised in that the gas flow 

control valve is as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8. 
A gas spring according to claim 9, further characterised in 
that the gas flow path through the valve (18, 20) is more 

restricted during the retraction stroke of the piston (12) than on 
the extension stroke, when the valve is open.
