in the form of a salt thereof formed with a physiologically acceptable inorganic or organic
acid, for use in therapy.The invention further comprises the compounds perse of formula (I) as just defined
with the exception firstly of the compound in which each of R1 to R8 is hydrogen, which
has been described by Vasella (Helvetica Chimica Acta. 1977. 60, 1273-1293) and by
Mzengeza (J. Chem. Soc.. Chem. Commun., 1984, 606) as a compound produced in an
investigation of the reactions of N-alkoxyalkyl nitrones and secondly of the compounds in
which R1 is a methyl and two of R5, R6, R7 and R8 together represent the second bond of a
double bond joining positions 4 and 5, 5 and 6 or 6 and 7 with the remaining of R2 to R8
being hydrogen (J. Org. Chem., 1982, 47, 857).The system of numbering used herein is based on that of the benzo[d]isoxazole ring
system as shown below
