<ABSTRACT>
The present application relates to a hydraulic coupling with a master-side coupling part (10) and a slave-side coupling part (12). The coupling parts, which are designed as a plug valve (14) and a sleeve valve (16) and can be plugged one into the other in a sealed manner for the purpose of coupling, close automatically in an uncoupled state and open each other during coupling. Circumferential seals (48, 56, 74) are provided, on the one hand, to seal off each coupling part in its uncoupled and closed state and, on the other hand, for the purpose of mutual sealing of the coupled coupling parts. The coupling parts (10, 12) are designed in such a way that all the circumferential seals (48, 56, 74) present are protected at all times from flows of the hydraulic medium caused by differential pressure.
