as the active ingredient, and an intermediate for the production thereof, wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, alkyl, etc.; 

R² and R³ represent each independently hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, -COR⁴ (wherein R⁴ represents alkoxy, etc.), alkoxy, 
haloalkoxy, cyano, etc.; X represents oxygen or sulfur; Y represents hydrogen, alkyl, etc.; A and B represent each 

independently halogen, alkoxy, alkyl, etc.; and Z represents nitrogen or methine. This compound has an excellent 
herbicidal effect on various weeds which cause troubles in the upland field over a wide period ranging from the 

pregermination stage to the growing period. It can also control weeds growing on the lowland field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
indazolesulfonylurea derivative (hereinafter referred to
as a compound of the present invention), an intermediate
for its production and a herbicide containing it as an
active ingredient.Heretofore, many sulfonylurea derivatives such as
sulfometuron-methyl have been known as herbicides.
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 95091/1992
discloses a herbicide containing an indazolesulfonylurea
as an active ingredient. However, the compound of the
present invention i.e. a sulfonylurea derivative having a
sulfamoyl group substituted at the 3-position of an
indazole ring, has not been known. Further, the
intermediate for its production i.e. an
indazolesulfonamide derivative, has also not been known.It is known that sulfonylurea derivatives have
herbicidal activities, but such compounds are not
necessarily practically satisfactory, for example, in
that their herbicidal effects are inadequate.Under these circumstances, the present inventors have
conducted various studies, and as a result, they have 
found that the compound of the present invention is an
excellent herbicide having a high activity and has
finally accomplished the present invention.Namely, the present invention provides an
indazolesulfonylurea derivative represented by the
general formula:
