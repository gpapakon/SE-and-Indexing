<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain substituted 
ketones, in particular, certain 1-pyrimidinylacetamide compounds, 
which are inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as 
human neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such 
inhibition is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, 
diagnostic and related studies and in the treatment of diseases in 
mammals in which HLE is implicated. For example, HLE has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, 
and other inflammatory disorders, including airway inflammatory 
diseases characterized by increased and abnormal airway secretion such 
as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Also, HLE has been 
implicated in certain vascular diseases and related conditions (and 
their therapy) in which neutrophil participation is involved or 
implicated, for example, in hemorrhage associated with acute 
non-lymphocytic leukemia, as well as in reperfusion injury associated 
with, for example, myocardial ischaemia and related conditions 
associated with coronary artery disease such as angina and infarction, 
cerebrovascular ischaemia such as transient ischaemic attack and 
stroke, peripheral occlusive vascular disease such as intermittent 
claudication and critical limb ischaemia, venous insufficiency such as 
venous hypertension, varicose veins and venous ulceration, as well as 
impaired reperfusion states such as those associated with 
reconstructive vascular surgery, thrombolysis and angioplasty. The 
invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these 
substituted ketones, processes for preparing the substituted ketones, 
pharmaceutical compositions containing such substituted ketones and 
methods for their use. In U.S. Patents 4,880,780, of 14 November 1989, and 
4,910,190, of 20 March 1990, assigned to ICI Americas Inc. (now ZENECA 
Inc.), there are disclosed two series of peptidic fluoroalkyl ketone 
derivatives which are HLE inhibitors. Disclosed herein is a series of 
substituted 2-(6-oxo-1,6-dihydro-1-pyrimidinyl)-N-[3,3-difluoro-1-(lower 
alkyl)-2-oxo-3-(N-substituted carbamoyl)propyl]acetamide  
 
derivatives, which unexpectedly possess inhibitory properties against 
HLE, which provides the basis for the present invention. According to the invention there is provided a Compound of 
the invention which is a compound of formula I (formula set out, 
together with other formulae referred to by Roman
