<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of electric discharge lamps, or fluorescent lamps, connected in series, are fed at the startup with a variable voltage having a frequency that is varied, during a preset time period, between preset extreme values, respectively a minimum value, and a maximum value, so as to cause the startup of the lamps with a convenient voltage value. Subsequently the lamps are fed with constant current having nominal frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD FOR FEEDING A PLURALITY OF DISCHARGE OR FLUORESCENT LAMPS CONNECTED IN SERIES, AND APPARATUS THAT CARRIES OUT SUCH METHODTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention is concerned with the technical field relating to continuous feeding of lamps for street, square or generic areas lighting, where the current (fed to the lamps pet) is kept at a value within a preset range .These lamps are gas-discharge or luminescence lamps, wherein the light emission is produced by an electric discharge that is made to occur in a gas, in a metallic vapour, or in a gas and vapour mixture.As an example the mercury or sodium vapour lamps and the like, must be cited, and they may have a low or high pressure.BACKGROUND ARTApparatuses for carrying out the startup and subsequently feeding the lamps as previously mentioned are already known. In an apparatus there is provided a bridge circuit having branches formed by reactive components. More precisely, two opposed branches of the bridge circuit include similar capacitors, while the remainders include similar inductances.A diagonal of the bridge circuit is shunted from the secondary winding of a feed transformer while the other diagonal is formed by the load constituted by a plurality of lamps . 

 The values of the inductances and capacitors are such that the well known resonance condition occurs. Consequently, if the capacitive and inductive reactances are considered as ideal ones (that practically is, if the resistive value is made negligible with respect to the reactive value) , the current intensity value that run through the lamps will practically be independent from the impedence value of the load. This current value will be a function of the feed frequency and voltage.A further known apparatus includes a feed transformer ( , also known as constant current transformer) that has the secondary winding mobile with respect to the primary winding. The secondary winding is subjected to the action resulting from the thrust of a counter-weight combined with the repulsion acting between the primary and secondary windings. The equilibrium condition for the mobile winding, in which a preset distance of this latter from the primary winding is set (as well as a corresponding secondary reactance) corresponds to a preset secondary current value that constitutes the feed current for the lamps.Any current variation provoked by any cause (such as a variation of the feed voltage, or a variation of the number of lamps connected) causes the mobile windings to move until the above mentioned
