<DESCRIPTION>
 Disabled/ Ablebodied PhotoboothThis invention relates to a Photobooth which may be used by both ablebodied and disabled people. The photobooth has been with us for some 60 years in that time precious little advancement has been made in respect of die design of the booth itself.Typically a photobooth is comprised of a rectangular structure containing the photographic equipment, a void in which the scat is fixed and a flat backboard.This configuration has drawbacks, notably:-a. It is impossible for the wheelchair bound to use this form of booth.b. the unenclosed nature of conventional booths renders them easy vulnerable to thieves and vandals.c. image quality is impaired because of constraints in lighting.The invention outlined here addresses these points and overcomes them. 

 The InventionThe first consideration when designing the invention was that of the disabled. This problem has been overcome by introducing rear access to the booth, (fig. 2) This solution brought with it other problems. If access is affected from the rear no background would exist. The answer here was to provide a motorised door/doors, (see fig. 2:1) We now have a booth which will accept both disabled and ablebodied individuals enclosed by way of a semi-circular door or doors, thus causing light from flash units to diffuse more effectively and thereby improve the quality of the resultant photographs.Security enhancement is also derived from the use of motorised door/doors.When the booth is not in use the door/doors remain closed. Inserting money from outside the booth (figl:5) causes the door/doors to open - describing an arc of 90 180Â° and covering the flash units, camera and cash box (fig 1:8).Once inside the customer presses die door close 

 button and the door/doors close to fulfil dieir function as a background. This exposes both photographic equipment and cash box. Photographs are taken and after a timed period the door/doors open automatically.If the customer wishes to vandalise or rob the booth his/her opportunity is during the timed period. However, should die integrity of the booth's main apparatus or coin box be compromised the door/doors will automatically lock and an alarm sound.Door configurationsThe motorised door/doors are represented in figs 3 and 4.In both cases activation will be by way of compressed air and return spring housed in roof (fig 1:2) of the booth. The foot of the door/doors will rest in a nylon brush enclosed channel (Fig 1:3.) Steel rollers within this feature will ease free running of
