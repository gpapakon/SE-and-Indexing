<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an absorber with conduits for conveying water or similar working fluid for its direct or indirect heating by solar energy, the conduits being bounded by at least one foil of translucent material, the foil/s (12) is/are joined together or to a plate by a frame (16) and/or clamping pieces (24) comprising two superposed shaped bodies, each having a surface with a wave-like cross-section, the two surfaces engaging one in the other when superposed. The shaped bodies are held pressed together by a pin-like fastening member, in particular a screw (25).

Absorber with flow paths for a heat transfer medium, e.g. water, for heating it by 
solar energy, in which the flow paths are delimited by at least one film (12, 14) of 

translucent material fixed in a liquid-tight manner towards its edges, at least one 
plate (20, 20a, 21) with a surface being associated with the film, characterised in 

that the film or films (12, 14) is/are joined together or to the plate (20, 20a, 21) by 
means of clamping pieces (24) consisting of two moulded bodies (30, 31; 52, 53) 

situated one on top of the other and each having a surface (29) with a wavy cross 
section, the two surfaces interlocking with one another one on top of the other and 

the moulded bodies being pressed together by at least one pin-type securing 
member, in particular a screw (25). 
Absorber according to claim 1, characterised in that the moulded bodies (30, 31) 
are disc-shaped and are provided about a central channel (32) with concentric 

annular beads (38, 39, 40) and annular grooves (42, 43, 44), the annular beads of 
one surface (29) engaging the annular grooves of the other surfaces. 
Absorber according to claim 1, characterised in that the moulded bodies (52, 53) 
are strip-shaped or bar-shaped and are provided at bore-shaped openings (32a) 

with arcuate concentric annular beads (38, 39, 40) and arcuate annular grooves 
(42, 43, 44) and linear beads (38a, 39a) and grooves (42a, 43a) extending between 

the latter, the beads of one surface engaging the grooves of the other surface. 
Absorber according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that at least one 
eccentric pin (46) projects from the surface (29) of one moulded body (30, 53) and 

can be inserted into a hole (48) in the other moulded body (31, 52). 
Absorber according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised by at least one pair of 
eccentric pins (46) on one diameter. 
Absorber according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a 
boundary for the flow paths is formed by at least one clamping piece (52, 53).  

 
Absorber according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that strip-shaped 
weld zones of the films are provided to delimit the flow paths and each 

strip-shaped weld zone (26) ends at a clamping piece (24). 
Absorber according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that it is 
surrounded by a frame (16) of profiles resting one on top of the other by 

respective surfaces (19) with a wavy cross section and clamping the film or films 
(12, 14) between them. 
Absorber according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the frame (16) 
and/or the clamping piece (24, 53) is/are rigidly connected to at least one plate 

(20, 20a, 21) or similar flat component. 
Absorber according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that at least 
one moulded body (30, 31; 52, 53) and/or the frame (16, 16h) has/have a passage 

(57) connected to the interior (13) of the absorber body (10, 11) as an inlet or 
outlet therefor. 
Absorber according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the frame (16h) 
and/or the clamping piece (24) is/are provided with additional profiles (58, 62) and 

are of adjustable height (h). 
Absorber according to claim 11, characterised in that a U-shaped profile (58) is 
provided as an additional profile between two frame profiles (17, 18) delimiting 

the frame (16h) and the frame profiles (17, 18) and the legs (59, 59t) have 
interlocking surfaces (19) with a wavy cross section, or that two moulded parts 

(30, 31) of two clamping piece pairs are connected together by a block (62) as an 
additional part. 
Absorber according to claim 11 or claim 12, characterised in that at least one 
additional profile (58, 62) has a passage (57) connected to the interior (13) of the 

absorber body (10, 11) as an inlet or outlet therefor.  
 
Absorber according to at least one of claims 1 to 13, characterised in that part of 
the frame (17, 18) and/or the moulded body (30, 31; 52, 53) is moulded from a 

plate (20a) or similar flat piece. 
Absorber according to at least one of claims 1 to 14, characterised in that it or its 
plate (20, 20a, 21) is inclined at an angle (w). 
Absorber according to claim 11 or claim 14, characterised in that the plate (20, 
20a, 21) is opposite a wire mesh or a perforated metal sheet (55) on the other side 

of the film. 
Absorber according to at least one of claims 1 to 16, characterised by an insulating 
layer (56) between the plate (20a) and the film (14). 
Absorber according to at least one of claims 1 to 17, characterised in that it 
contains at least one UV-transmitting and UV- and weather-resistant film (12).
