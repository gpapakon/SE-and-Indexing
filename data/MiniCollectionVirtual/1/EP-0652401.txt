<ABSTRACT>
Outdoor luminaires are secured to different shapes of masts and are often adjusted at a predetermined inclination angle ( alpha ) relative to the horizontal. For this multiplicity of arrangements, a device for securing masts is to be provided which can be used in a versatile manner and which permits simple mounting of the luminaire. For this purpose, the luminaire housing (10) has a domed bearing surface (13) which surrounds the luminaire opening (11) on the mast side and which has a predetermined radius (R) parallel to a vertical cross-sectional plane which contains the axis of the luminous means. A connection piece (20) serving to secure the luminaire (1) to the mast end (31) has a securing flange (23) which is bent according to this bearing surface and which is placed in the form of a collar around the tube flange (pipe flange) (21), and in each case one elongate hole (24) for receiving a securing screw (14) is provided in the domed part of the securing flange, on both sides of the tube flange. In this way, the connection piece is secured to the luminaire housing in a manner such that it is displaceable by a predetermined angular range ( alpha ) relative to the bearing surface and covers the luminaire opening in every position. Mounting of luminaires for attachment to and on masts.

Outdoor luminaire having a luminaire housing (10)
which has a luminaire opening (11) on the mast side for

admitting supply cables, having a connecting piece (20)
which serves to secure the luminaire housing on the end

(31) of a luminaire mast (3) and has a tubular flange
(21) which can be pushed over the mast end like a sleeve,

and having securing means (14 and 28, 29) for securing
the connecting piece on the luminaire housing and on the

mast end, characterized in that the luminaire housing
(10) has a cambered bearing surface (13) which surrounds

the mast-side luminaire opening (11) and is constructed
to have a profile of circular cross-section with a

prescribed radius (R), and in that the connecting piece
(20) has as counterpiece to said bearing surface a

cylindrically curved securing flange (23) which is laid
in the shape of a collar around the tubular flange (21)

and in which there is provided on both sides of the
tubular flange (21) one elongated hole (24) each for

holding in each case one securing screw (14) which is
inserted in each case into an assigned threaded bore (15)

provided in the bearing surface (13), with the result
that the connecting piece can be displaced by a prescribed

angular range (α) relative to the bearing surface
(13) and can be secured in this case on the luminaire

housing (10) in any possible position, in a fashion
covering the mast-side luminaire opening (11).
Outdoor luminaire according to Claim 1, characterized
in that, on the one hand, the luminaire opening

(11) is constructed symmetrically relative to a figure 
axis arranged in kind at approximately 45° to the

luminaire longitudinal axis so that the centre of curvature
of the bearing surface (13) likewise lies on this

figure axis, and in that, on the other hand, the geometrical
assignment between the tubular flange (21) and the

securing flange (23) is selected for the connecting piece
(20) in such a way that the longitudinal axis of the

tubular flange is aligned at approximately 45° to the
figure axis of the luminaire opening in each normal

position, determined by an angle of inclination (α) of
0°, for vertical alignment as a mast-top arrangement or

horizontal alignment as a side-mounted arrangement.
Outdoor luminaire according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the luminaire opening (11) is

defined, in a fashion forming a cavity in the luminaire
housing (10), by inwardly drawn side walls which are

essentially perpendicular to one another and in which a
cutout (12) is provided for guiding through cables, and

in that the securing flange (23) is mounted on the
tubular flange (21) of the connecting piece (20) in such

a way that in the mounted state of the connecting piece
the tubular flange is arranged projecting into this

cavity thus formed in the luminaire housing.
Outdoor luminaire according to one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the securing flange (23) is

fixed on the tubular flange (21), structurally reinforced,
by means of stiffening ribs (25) which enclose a

securing eye (26) having a through bore, reaching through
the wall of the tubular flange, for holding securing

means (28, 29) of the tubular flange on the mast end
(31).
Outdoor luminaire according to Claim 4, characterized
in that a threaded nut (28) and a screw (29) are

provided as securing means for fixing the tubular flange
(21) to the mast end (31), and in that the securing eye

(26) has a groove (27), extending perpendicular to the
through bore, for holding the threaded nut (28) securely

against rotation, and consequently the screw (29), turned 
into the threaded nut (28), braces the mast end (31),

pushed into the tubular flange (21), in the tubular
flange in a force-closed fashion.
Outdoor luminaire according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the bearing surface (13),

surrounding the luminaire opening (11), for the securing
flange (23) is offset inwards, forming a step, from the

outer contour of the luminaire housing (10), as a result
of which when mounted on this bearing surface the

connecting piece (20) can be aligned with the outer
contour thereof.
Outdoor luminaire according to Claim 6, characterized
in that the height of the step of the bearing

surface (13) relative to the surrounding outer contour of
the luminaire housing (10) corresponds to the thickness

of the securing flange (23) of the connecting piece (20),
and consequently the securing flange is fitted without

transition into the surrounding outer contour of the
luminaire housing.
Outdoor luminaire according to one of Claims 1 to
7, characterized in that latching means (16, 14, 17) for

exactly setting the angle of inclination (α) when mounting
the connecting piece (20) are provided within the

bearing surface (13) and on the securing flange (23).
Outdoor luminaire according to Claim 8, characterized
in that said latching means comprise at least one

knob (17), which projects from the surface of the bearing
surface (13) and to which there are assigned mating

surfaces (16) on the securing flange (23) which are
configured in accordance with the shape of the knob.
