<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to glass based on silicon 
oxide and calcium oxide. For producing gems one preferably uses glass qualities 
which have a high refractive index nD > 1.55 and a hardness 
as high as possible and are able to absorb enough dopants 
that even small stones with an envelope curve of under 1 mm 
can be intensively colored. To produce gems one often uses lead glass qualities 
with a PbO content of up to over 30% by weight. These glass 
qualities usually also contain small amounts of As₂O₃ and/or 
Sb₂O₃. Advantages of these glass compositions are the relatively 
high refractive index, which provides fire or brilliance, 
and that colored stones with this basic composition 
are interesting as gems due to their lively sparkle. However, disadvantages of these glass compositions are 
their toxic components and the low Mohs' hardness of 5.5, 
which do not permit use as a ring stone for example. A clear improvement in hardness can be obtained for 
example by glass qualities of the system silicon oxide, 
lithium oxide, aluminum oxide and beryllium oxide. However, 
with beryllium oxide and lithium oxide these glass qualities 
likewise contain very toxic substances. The invention is based on the problem of providing a 
novel glass composition that can be built up completely from 
nontoxic components and has a high refractive index and high 
hardness. The object of the invention is a glass composition 
characterized by the following composition in % by weight 
based on oxide:
 
   SiO₂ 42 - 64
 
   CaO 21 - 57
 
   Al₂O₃ 1 - 15.  The object of the invention is also the use of a glass 
composition with the following components in % by weight 
based on oxide:
 
   SiO₂ 42 - 64
 
   CaO 21 - 57
 
   Al₂O₃ 1 - 15
 
to produce gems with a refractive index of over 1.59 and a 
Mohs' hardness of over 6. The system silicon oxide, calcium oxide, aluminum oxide 
contains solely safe components and is therefore suitable 
for all applications in which people come in direct contact 
with the glass, for example for gems. The inventive glass compositions typically show a refractive 
index of over 1.59 and a Mohs' hardness of over 6. The glass compositions are also characterized by high 
absorbing power for dopants for giving the glass any coloring. 
Even small gems with an envelope curve of under 1 mm 
can be intensively colored. The inventive glass compositions also show high chemical 
resistance. The glass composition in % by weight is preferably as 
follows:
 
   SiO₂ 46 - 60
 
   CaO 30 - 50
 
   Al₂O₃ 2 -
