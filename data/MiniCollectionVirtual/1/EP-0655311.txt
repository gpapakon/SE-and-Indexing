<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coextrusion, 
particularly of a composite having thermally distinct 
layers. Composites including layers having thermally 
distinct processing requirements, are of considerable 
commercial importance. In the case of some materials, 
thermal sensitivity is a problem during processing. For 
example, material degradation and equipment fouling may 
result. In other cases, it is beneficial to take advantage 
of thermal sensitivity, by for instance providing useful 
surface effects. For example, a surface oxidation-promoting, 
melt temperature benefits surface adhesion of 
materials such as polyethylene (PE). In even other cases, 
high temperatures are necessary for processability due to 
for instance, high melt viscosity. One such composite is a liquid packaging 
container including a paperboard/low density polyethylene/low 
density polyethylene structure. The challenge is to 
provide a paperboard-contacting, PE layer with a preferred 
surface oxidation-promoting, melt temperature of about 
315°C or more for good surface bonding to the paperboard, 
and to provide a liquid-contacting, PE layer with a 
preferred lower melt temperature of approximately 275°C to 
285°C. The higher melt temperature promotes bonding by 
promoting oxidation of the PE surface and enhancement of 
surface wetting. The lower melt temperature reduces 
surface oxidation, and provides improved heat seal 
performance and improved organoleptic properties including 
decreased residual odor. Another such composite includes an oriented 
polypropylene substrate/low density polyethylene/ethylene  
 
vinyl acetate structure. The PE layer benefits from a melt 
processing temperature of about 300°C or more for promotion 
of substrate adhesion, whereas the ethylene vinyl acetate 
(EVA) layer preferably has a melt processing temperature of 
about 230°C or less to minimize residual odor. Also, EVA 
is thermally sensitive at elevated temperatures, with 
decomposition being further accelerated by metal contact. Also including layers having thermally distinct 
processing requirements, is protective document laminating 
film including an oriented polyester substrate/polyethylene/ethylene 
vinyl acetate structure. EVA is a 
desirable thermoplastic for document contact because of its 
low heat sealing temperature. However, as may be 
understood from the previous example, PE and EVA typically 
have thermally distinct processing requirements. As can be understood by one skilled in the art, 
composites including layers having
