<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to selective call
receivers, and more specifically to an apparatus
for automatic generation and notification of identification
information corresponding to a received message.Selective call messaging, such as paging messaging,
involves transmitting a message or a page to an intended
selective call receiver by radio frequency (RF) signals.
The page is received from an originator at a selective call
terminal and is encoded into a format recognizable by the
selective call receiver. A selective call address assigned
to the receiver is added to the message to indicate the
intended selective call receiver. The message is then
transmitted for reception within a selective call system
coverage area in which the receiver is expected to be
located.Conventionally, pages are received by the selective
call terminal from remote devices via telephones, in the
case of voice and numeric messages, or data handlers, in
the case of alphanumeric messages. In addition, some pages
are originated from information supplied to video display
terminals (VDTs) coupled directly to the selective call
terminal. The format of the signals received from the
telephones, data handlers, and VDTs are known to the
selective call terminal and are compatible with the
formatting of the selective call signals into known
signalling formats. Pages sent from the data handler to the selective call
terminal may originate from information service providers.
Information service providers may provide database messages
including financial data, news, sports or other generally
distributed information. Each selective call receiver
which is to receive database messages from an information
service provider must recognize which database messages are
authorized for reception by the selective call receiver.
Initially, when the selective call receiver receives an RF
signal, it must discriminate between personal messages and
database messages sent by information service providers.
Once this is accomplished, the selective call receiver
determines whether or not the database message is one that
the selective call receiver is authorized to receive. The
personal messages and the authorized database messages are
subsequently stored in memory.Both database messages sent by information service
providers and personal messages may be viewed by the user
on a display device, such as a liquid crystal display
(LCD), incorporated by the selective call receiver.
Displaying a database on the LCD may become unwieldy,
however, due to the typically

<CLAIMS>
A selective call receiver (110) for receiving
selective call messages and for storing databases, the

selective call receiver (110) comprising:

receiver means (202,205) for receiving and decoding
a selective call message to recover therefrom message

information comprising updated information for replacing
at least a portion of a complete database;
storing means (225,235) coupled to the receiver
means (202,205) for storing the message information

included in the selective call message;
generating means (220) coupled to the receiver means
(202,205) for generating tag information in response to

receiving the selective call message, wherein the tag
information indicates the complete database to which the

message information relates and further indicates the at
least a portion of the complete database which is to be

replaced by the message information;

   
characterised in that
 the selective call receiver
(110) also comprises:


an interface (250) coupled to the generating means
for coupling to an external electronic device; and
control means coupled to the generating means (220)
and the interface (250) for providing the tag

information via the interface
to the external electronic device.
The selective call receiver (110) in accordance
with claim 1, wherein:


the storing means (225,235) stores the message
information included in the selective call message in a

memory location determined by routing information
included in the selective call message; and wherein 
the generating means (220) generates tag
information based on the routing information.
The selective call receiver (110) in accordance
with claim 1, further comprising determining means

coupled to the receiver means and the generating means
(220) for determining that the message information

comprises updated information relating to a database.
The selective call receiver (110) in accordance
with claim 3, wherein:


the storing means (225,235) stores the message
information included in the selective call message in a

memory location determined by routing information
included in the selective call message when the message

information comprises updated information; and
the generating means (220) generates the tag
information based on the routing information when message

information comprises updated information.
A selective call receiver (110) for receiving
selective call messages of different types and for

storing databases, the selective call receiver
comprising:


a receiver (202,205) for receiving a selective call
message;
a decoder (215) for decoding the selective call message to
recover therefrom message information;
a memory (225,235) for
storing the message information included in the

selective call message;
processing means (220) coupled to the decoder and
the memory for determining whether the message

information comprises updated information for replacing
at least a portion of a complete database;
the selective call receiver
being 
characterized by
 : 

an interface (250) coupled to the processing means
for coupling to an external electronic device; and that
the processing means being further adapted to generate tag
information in response to the processing means (220)

determining that the message information comprises
updated information and to provide the tag

information to the interface(250), wherein the tag
information indicates the complete database to which the

message information relates and further indicates the at
least a portion of the complete database which is to be

replaced.
The selective call receiver (110) in accordance
with claim 5, wherein:


the memory (225,235) stores the message
information included in the selective call message in a

memory location determined by routing information
included in the selective call message when the message

information comprises updated information; and
the processing means (220) generates the tag
information based on the routing when the message

information comprises updated information.
The selective call receiver (110) in accordance
with claim 5, further comprising alerting means coupled

to the processing means for alerting a user when the
selective call message has been received.
The selective call receiver (110) in accordance
with claim 1, wherein the tag information comprises a

database identification indicative of the complete 
database and a block number indicative of the at least a

portion of the complete database.
The selective call receiver (110) in accordance
with claim 5, wherein the tag information comprises a

database identification indicative of the complete
