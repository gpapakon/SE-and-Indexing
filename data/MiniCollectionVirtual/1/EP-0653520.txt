<ABSTRACT>
A water-supply system, in particular for buffet cars of passenger trains, essentially comprises at least one water tank (1), a circulating circuit (2), which is formed by pipes and/or hoses and contains a circulating pump (3) and a UV sterilising unit (4), as well as a pressure line (5) which leads to the consumer points - such as water tap, dishwasher. In order, in the case of such a water-supply system, to realise as simple a construction as possible with a small number of components, a circulating pump (3), designed as a self-priming centrifugal pump, is also used, in addition to carrying out its circulating function, as a pressure-increasing and delivery pump for the pressure line (5).
