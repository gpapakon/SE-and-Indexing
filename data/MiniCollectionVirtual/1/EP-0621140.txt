<ABSTRACT>
A refillable writing implement (1) has a writing tank (2) for supplying writing liquid to the nib (4). It has an additional storage tank (3), from which the writing tank (2) can be refilled via a connection acting as a valve (6). The storage tank (3) can be refilled from the outside via a valve with an associated refill container. The refill container has an injection needle with a valve, and means for subjecting the writing liquid in its interior to pressure.

A refillable fluid writing implement with a 
supply reservoir (3) for supplying a writing tip (4) with 

a writing fluid, with a hollow channel (16) extending 
into the supply reservoir from outside and being interrupted 

by a valve in the form of a rubber membrane (13) 
having a fine central hole which in the relaxed condition 

of the rubber membrane (13) is tightly closed and is intended 
to receive an injection needle (21) of a refill 

container (20) that is adapted to be connected up to the 
supply reservoir from outside for a refill, 
characterized 
in that
 the supply reservoir (3) is provided additionally 
to a writing reservoir (2) from which writing fluid is 

fed to the writing tip (4), that the writing reservoir 
(2) is refillable from the supply reservoir (2) by means 

of a connection operating as a valve (6), that the supply 
reservoir (3) is larger than the writing reservoir (2) 

from which it is separated by means of a separating wall 
(5) having a central opening (8), with the rim of the 

opening (8) being configured as a valve seat, and that a 
valve disk (7) mounted on a valve rod (9) extending in 

the direction of the end of the writing implement is 
seated in the opening (8), the valve rod carrying at its 

end a push-button (10) operable from the outside of the 
writing implement (1) and sealed off with respect to the 

inside of the supply reservoir (3), with the push-button 
(10) being returnable to its initial position. 
The fluid writing implement as claimed in claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 the push-button (10) is loaded 
by a compression spring from the inside. 
The fluid writing implement as claimed in any 
one of the claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the writing 
implement (1) has shaped end portions (26, 27) suitable 

for positive engagement with a push-on sleeve (23) 
of a refill container (20), within which sleeve the 

injection needle (21) extends. 
The fluid writing implement according to the 
prior-art portion of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
supply reservoir (3) is provided additionally to a writing 

reservoir (2) from which writing fluid is fed to the 
writing tip (4), that the writing reservoir (2) is 

refillable from the supply reservoir (2) through a connection 
operating as a valve (6), that the supply reservoir 

(3) is larger than the writing reservoir (2) from 
which it is separated by means of a separating wall (5) 

configured as a valve disk which is in sealing engagement  
 

with a portion of the wall converging conically towards 
the end of the writing implement, and that the valve disk 

is mounted on a valve rod extending in the direction of 
the end of the writing implement, the valve rod carrying 

at its end a push-button operable from the outside of the 
writing implement and sealed off with respect to the inside 

of the supply reservoir, with the push-button being 
loaded by a compression spring from the inside. 
A combination of a refillable fluid writing 
implement (1) as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 4 

and a refill container (20), with means (22) for pressurizing 
the writing fluid in the interior of the refill 

container and an injection needle (21) having a central 
bore (29), with the outlet opening (44) of the bore (29) 

being tightly sealed by a rubber seal (33) in the position 
of non-use, 
characterized in that
 the injection 
needle (21) extends within and along a sleeve (23) encasing 

it, the sleeve (23) being adapted to be push-fitted 
onto an end of the fluid writing implement (1) in positive 

engagement therewith, and that the refill container 
(20) includes means effecting venting of the supply 

reservoir (3) during the filling in of writing fluid. 
The combination as claimed in claim 5, 

characterized in that
 the injection needle (21) is enclosed 
by a spring-loaded rubber seal (33) tightly closing 

the needle outlet opening (44), the outlet opening 
(44) being exposed by pushing back the rubber seal (33) 

against the force of the spring over the injection needle 
(21). 
The combination as claimed in any one of the 
claims 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 the injection needle 
(21) includes a vent bore (45) separated from the central 

bore (29), and that the mouth (32) of the vent bore (45) 
communicates with a radial vent bore (43) in the rubber 

seal (33). 
The combination as claimed in any one of the 
claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the means (22) for 
pressurising the writing fluid are provided in that the 

container (20) forms a bellows (22) whose rear end is intended 
to function as a pressure-application surface and 

as a bearing surface of the container (20).  
 
The combination as claimed in any one of the 
claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the means for 
press
urising the writing fluid are provided in that a 
plunger is adapted to be pushed into the interior of the 

container from the outside. 
The combination as claimed in any one of the 
claims 5 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the container is 
configured as a collective refill container (30) for 

several users and includes a mounting device for mounting 
it on a wall.
