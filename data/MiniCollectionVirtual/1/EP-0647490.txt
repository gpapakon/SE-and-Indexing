<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum casting apparatus (2,52,202,252) is disclosed in which gas 
tightness of the die cavity is secured without welding 

together a straight-tubular stalk (30,80,130,190,280,330) 
and a flange or flanges (20A,B,42,44,70,128,278,328), 

thus permitting excellent quality casting to be obtained. 
The vacuum casting apparatus (2,52,202,252) uses two flanges which are 

mounted in a mutually spaced-apart relation and via two seal 
members (22,26,72,76,74A,B) on the outer periphery of a stalk 

(30,80,130,190,280,330,380) and secured via 
upper and lower seal members between a gas-tight chamber 

(150,220,270,350) and 
a die (4,54,144,344). The gas-tight chamber is fitted on the die from 

above to form a gas-tight space between the two parts. With 
the operation of an external vacuum pump (224,274,324), the space is 

evacuated via a pair of communication holes (60a,b) to be close to 
the inner pressure in a cavity (310) of the die during vacuum 

casting. Thus, air that intrudes into the cavity (310) of the die 
through small gaps between the flanges and the stalk is 

reduced, thereby reliably preventing the inconvenience of 
casting defect generation in the cast product which might 

otherwise result from air trapping in the die cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in a vacuum
casting apparatus in which a gas-tight chamber for
accommodating a die is evacuated to evacuate a die cavity so
as to lead molten metal through a stalk into the evacuated
cavity. According to the preambles of claims 1, 2 and 3, and to a
method of vacuum casting according to the preamble of claim 7.In the above vacuum casting apparatus, a melting
furnace for storing molten metal in its molten state is
disposed outside the gas-tight chamber and connected to the
cavity via the stalk. To this end, the wall of the gas-tight
chamber has a through hole through which the stalk is
passed. In order to be able to obtain satisfactory
evacuation in the gas-tight chamber, it is necessary to
provide satisfactory seal of the gap between the surface of
the through hole and the stalk. To meet this requirement,
many techniques have been proposed.The most well-known one of these techniques is a system
in which the gap is sealed with a flange extending from the
outer periphery of the stalk. A contrivance for obtaining a
better seal with such a flange is disclosed in Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 63-84757. FIG. 20 shows 
this technique. In this technique, a lower wall member 511
is detachably mounted on the underside of a gas-tight
chamber 502 via a seal 512. A sub-chamber 514 is thus
formed by the gas-tight chamber 502 and the lower wall
member 511, and is communicated with the gas-tight chamber
502 via a through hole 522. The gap between the lower wall
member 511 and a stalk 505 is sealed with a flange 505a
formed on the outer periphery of the stalk 505. In this
system, the sub-chamber 514 is evacuated, and thus it is
possible to hold the amount of air intruding through the gap
between the surface of the through hole 502b of the gas-tight
chamber 502 and the stalk 505 to be low.This system is an effective technique insofar as
obtaining satisfactory gas-tight chamber evacuation.
However, it is necessary to provide the flange 505a on the
outer periphery of the stalk 505.The stalk should not be one which contaminates the
molten metal by releasing impurities thereinto when exposed
to the high temperature of the molten metal. Accordingly,
it has been contemplated to form the stalk with the same
metal as the molten metal. Where the stalk and the molten
metal are of the same metal, the problem of the
contamination of molten metal is not posed.Where the stalk is made of the same metal as the molten
metal, it is readily melted. Therefore, it has to be 
replaced
