<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides pharmaceutical preparations containing 
highly concentrated tumor cytotoxic factor (TCF). The pharmaceutical 

prparations of the present invention contain highly concentrated TCF 
and a basic amino acid or their salts, or an organic or inorganic salt 

as a solubizer. The resultant compositions described in the present 
invention dissolve TCF at high concentrations of 10 mg/ml or over 

under about neutral and isotonic conditions. The resultant 
compositions are stable and are suitable for injection preparations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical preparations having tumor
cytotoxic factor activity.Tumor cytotoxic factor, hereinafter abbreviated as TCF, is an
another name of TCF-II found in a cultured supernatant of human
fibroblast cells and disclosed in WO 90/10651. TCF is a glycoprotein
consisting of heterodimer having molecular weight of about 76-80 kDa
in unreduced state, and α subunit having molecular weight of about
52-56 kDa and β or β' subunit having molecular weight of about 30-36
kDa in reduced state.TCF exhibits various biological activities such as the activities of
hepatocyte growth factor; HGF, scatter factor; SF, proliferation
factor of renal tubular epithelial cells, repair factor for damaged
tissues and proliferation factor of vascular endothelial cells, in
addition to TCF activity. TCF is a cytokine belonging to a member of
HGF family. TCF is expected to be developed as pharmaceuticals for
the treatment of diseases of liver and kidneys, wounds and tumors due
to its various kinds of physiological activity.However, the solubility in water of TCF is very low. Thus aqueous
preparations such as injections with high concentrations satisfying 
medical use are hardly obtained. Therefore, one of the most serious
subject to be solved for its application to the clinical use is
preparing such a concentrated solution of TCF. TCF has rapid
metabolic turnover in vivo and high dosage is expected on the clinical
use. The clinical dosage of TCF is expected to be 1-10 mg/day for
adult patients. To make sure of the quality of final products, such
as injections, the production processes require to dissolve TCF at
high concentrations and to mix it with additives such as stabilizers
under low temperatures. Furthermore, a highly concentrated TCF
solution is demanded for medical treatment, that is the solution of
neutral pH and has isotonicity for injections. No such method to
prepare highly concentrated TCF solution has been developed yet. For
example, an isotonic saline solution, containing 0.15 M sodium
chloride usually used for injectins, dissolves TCF less than 5 mg/ml
and the TCF solution is unstable. The solubility of TCF decreases
and TCF becomes insoluble with the progress of time at room
temperature. Furthermore, solubility of TCF in saline markedly
decreases to about 1 mg/ml at 5 °C or lower.Therefore, it is an important subject to establish a method for
preparing a neutral, isotonic and highly concentrated TCF solution at
low temperatures. Above mentioned WO 90/10651 discloses preparations
containing
