<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bicycle wheel 
particularly, but not exclusively, intended for 
enabling off-road bicycles to mount standard road 
tires, and a method for the manufacture thereof. Great popularity are enjoying at present 
bicycles which are typically designed for off-road use 
and commonly referred to as "mountain bikes". Such 
bicycles are characterized by a robust frame and wheels 
for mounting wide-base tires with grip treads. Such 
wheels often have, for a given rolling circumference, 
rims of reduced diameter compared to similar wheels for 
standard on-road bicycles. This is due, at least in 
part, to the increased height of the grip tire over the 
standard road tire. Despite their specific destination, 
mountain bikes are frequently used on roads as well. In 
that case, it is desirable that the user be enabled to 
replace the grip tire-mounting wheels with wheels 
equipped with standard tires for road circulation. This exchange is a relatively troublesome one 
to carry out, as well as one likely to adversely affect 
the brake performance. It is well known, in fact, that 
mountain bikes are usually equipped with shoe brakes 
which act on opposed wheel rim surfaces effective to 
provide frictional contact tracks for the respective 
brake shoes. This invention is directed to provide a 
bicycle wheel useful with bicycles intended for 
different purposes, as well as being easy to exchange 
on normally off-road bicycles in order to convert the  
 
latter for normal road circulation. This problem is solved by a bicycle wheel, 
particularly for converting bicycles originally 
designed for off-road uses to the use of standard 
on-road tires, which wheel comprises a wheel rim joined 
to a wheel hub, said wheel rim being channel-shaped 
with the convex facing toward the wheel hub and having 
a radially outermost end formed with respective free 
edges, characterized in that it comprises an annular 
shaped adapter for mounting a tire and having a tire 
mounting channel and means of gripping the free edges 
of said rim, said adapter being assembled to said rim 
with said grip means engaged over said free edges and 
held thereto by the tire mounted in said channel. This wheel is manufactured by a method which 
comprises the following step:
 
   providing a wheel rim joined to a wheel hub 
for rotation therewith, said wheel rim being 
channel-shaped with the convex facing toward the wheel 
hub and having a radially outermost end formed with

A method for manufacturing a bicycle 
wheel, particularly for mounting standard on-road tires 

on bicycles originally intended for off-road use, 
comprising the following step: 

   providing a wheel rim (4) joined to a wheel 
hub (2) for rotation therewith, said wheel rim being 

channel-shaped with the convex facing toward the wheel 
hub and having a radially outermost end formed with 

respective free edges (6a,b), 
characterized in that it further comprises the 

following steps: 
   providing an adapter (24,25) for mounting a 

tire (20,22) thereon, said adapter having an annular 
configuration with a tire mounting channel (26,27) and 

including means (28a,b) of gripping the free edges 
(6a,b) of said rim; 

   assembling said adapter (24,26) to said rim 
with said grip means (28a,b) engaged over said free 

edges (6a,b); and 
   mounting said tire (20,22) in the channel 

(26,27) of said adapter, the adapter being held to said 
rim by said tire. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein 
said rim (4) and said hub (2) are joined to each other 

by spokes (3), said rim, said hub and said spokes being 
aluminum alloy die-castings. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein 
said tire mounting adapter (24,25) has a split ring 

configuration and is obtained by bending sectional 
stock formed with said channel (26,27) and said grip 

means (28a,b). 
A method according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, wherein said adapter (24,25) is 

 
releasably attached to the wheel rim (4). 
A method according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, wherein said adapter (24,25) is held 

with said grip means (28a,b) engaged over the 
corresponding edges (6a,b) of the wheel rim (4) by the 

inflation pressure of said tire (20,22). 
A method according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, wherein said grip means (28a,b) are 

arranged to provide a combined radial and axial holding 
action of said adapter (24,25) to the wheel rim (4).
