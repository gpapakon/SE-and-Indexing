<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic photosensitive member,
particularly to an electrophotographic photosensitive
member having a photosensitive layer containing a
specific disazo pigment.The present invention also relates to a
process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus
respectively using the electrophotographic
photosensitive member.Hitherto, there have been proposed organic
photoconductive materials to be used for
electrophotographic photosensitive members.The photosensitive members employing the
organic photoconductive materials have advantages in
that the photosensitive members may easily be
produced, are relatively inexpensive and are allowed
to readily control a wavelength region having
sensitivity (or photosensitivity) by appropriately
selecting dyes or pigments used. Thus, many
photosensitive members employing organic
photoconductive materials have heretofore been
proposed. Particularly, there has been proposed a 
photosensitive member having a lamination-type
structure, wherein a photosensitive layer comprises a
charge generation layer containing a charge-generating
material such as organic photoconductive dyes or
pigments and a charge transport layer containing a
charge-transporting material such as photoconductive
polymers or low-molecular weight organic
photoconductive materials (i.e., so-called "function-separation
type photosensitive member"). Such a
function-separation type photosensitive member has
brought about a considerable improvement on a
conventional organic photosensitive member having
defects such as low sensitivity and poor durability.As the organic photoconductive materials, a
large number of azo pigments have been proposed since
the azo pigments have excellent photoconductivity and
are relatively readily produced by appropriately
selecting an azo component and a coupler component in
providing various electrophotographic characteristics.
Such azo pigments have been disclosed in Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. (JP-A) 61-215556
(corresponding to U.S.P. 4,666,805) 63-177143 (U.S.P.
4,917,981), 63-178247 (U.S.P. 4,917,981), 63-183449,
2-84659, etc.In recent years, however, a further
improvement in electrophotographic characteristics
such as the resultant image qualities and durability 
is required. Accordingly, with respect to the above-mentioned
photosensitive member, there is still room
for improvement in sensitivity and stability of
electric potential in repetitive use, etc.An object of the present invention is to
provide an
