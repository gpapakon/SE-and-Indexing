<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polypropylene composition
having excellent rigidity, heat resistance,
impact resistance and toughness.Crystalline polypropylene has excellent properties, for example, rigidity,
heat resistance and surface glossiness. However,
there is a problem that the polypropylene has poor impact
resistance.There have heretofore been proposed
various methods to improve the impact resistance of such a
polypropylene. For example, there is known a method in
which crystalline polypropylene is incorporated with
modifiers such as polyethylene or a rubbery substance. As
such a rubbery substance (rubber component), an amorphous
or low crystalline ethylene/propylene random copolymer
(EPR), polyisobutylene or polybutadiene is generally
used.In order to improve the impact strength of
polypropylene,
however, a large amount of the
rubbery substance must be contained in the polypropylene.
Although the polypropylene composition containing a
large amount of the rubbery substance certainly has improved 
impact resistance, the
composition had deteriorated rigidity, heat
resistance and surface hardness.Under such circumstances, there have been proposed
various polypropylene compositions which contain the
rubbery substance as mentioned above together with
inorganic fillers such as talc in order to impart rigidity
to the compositions (see, for example, Japanese Patent L-O-P
Publns. Nos. 58459/85, 60154/85, 233048/86, 36348/86,
235350/87, 122751/88, 150343/88, 149845/89, 204947/89 and
271450/89).In such a polypropylene composition containing a large
amount of the rubbery substance, however, there is a limit in
improving the rigidity by means of incorporation
thereinto of the inorganic filler. Hence
it is difficult to use the composition for
purposes where a high rigidity of the composition is
required.Therefore, it has been desired to develop a
polypropylene composition which not only has excellent rigidity
and heat resistance but also excellent impact resistance and
toughness.Research conducted by the present inventors on the
polypropylene composition referred to above resulted in
the finding that in the case of conventionally known
polypropylene compositions formed from polypropylene and an
ethylene/propylene random copolymer (rubber component), a
part of the amorphous component in the polypropylene is 
mingled in the rubber component, and this rubber component
is bound by the amorphous component of the polypropylene,
with the result that the rubber
component insufficiently improves the impact
