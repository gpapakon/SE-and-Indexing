<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
use of compounds for the manufacture of a medicament
for the treatment of
arthritis, including both rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis. In particular, this invention relates to such
uses by the administration of bone-active
phosphonate compounds and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). The bone-active phosphonates and NSAIDS act in synergy
with one another and their administration results in a reduction
of inflammation, but also inhibits the destruction of bone and
hard tissue in the intraarticular area of the joint, which
permits repair of the sub-chondral bone and hard tissue.Bone loss, or alteration in bone turnover, can result from,
or be associated with, many types of arthritis, including
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is
a chronic, systemic and articular inflammatory disorder
characterized by weakening of the joint capsules and ligaments,
followed by destruction of cartilage, ligaments, tendon and bone,
and a decrease in viscosity and other alterations in the synovial
membrane and fluid. Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms include
systemic weakness, fatigue, localized pain, and stiffness,
weakness, swelling, and deformation of the joints of the body.
Rheumatoid arthritis is most common in women in the fourth to
sixth decade of life.The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, leading to the
destruction of the joints, is characterized by two phases: 1) an 
exudative phase involving the microcirculation of the synovial
cells that allow an influx of plasma proteins and cellular
elements into the joint and 2) a chronic inflammatory phase
occurring in the sub-synovium and sub-chondral bone,
characterized by pannus (granulation tissue) formation in the
joint space, bone erosion, and cartilage destruction. The pannus
may form adhesions and scar tissue which causes the joint
deformities characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis.The etiology of rheumatoid arthritis remains obscure.
Infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses have been
implicated. A current hypothesis is that the Epstein-Barr (EBV)
virus is a causative agent for rheumatoid arthritis.Current rheumatoid arthritis treatment consists
predominantly of symptomatic relief by administration of
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAID treatment
is mainly effective in the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis;
it is unlikely it will produce suppression of joint inflammation
if the disease is present for more than one year. Gold,
