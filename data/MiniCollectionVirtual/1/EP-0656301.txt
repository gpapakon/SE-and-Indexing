<ABSTRACT>
A food package formed from a high temperature resistant 
container (10) having a side wall (16) extending upwardly from said 

base to a top edge (18) which defines an opening and a 
substantially microwave transparent cover (24) positioned over 

substantially all of either the opening or the surface of 
the base characterised in that the cover has aluminium 

laminated depending side edges (19) adapted to be secured to a 
major or total part of the side wall (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a food package for controlled 
heating or cooking of prepared food in hot air, convection, 
household and microwave ovens. The rapid increase of the microwave oven sale to private 
households and the development of catering have changed the 
conditions for the prepared food manufacturers implying 
great advantages as well as problems. The advantages are 
evident and connected with the rapid heating in microwaves 
which make frozen prepared food even more convenient. There 
are two main problems: 
The traditional metallic tray is opaque to microwave 
radiation and is not suitable in microwave ovens as arcing 
may occur inside the oven cavity resulting in a very bad 
perception of this package by the consumer. Since metals are 
not transparent to microwaves and heating is obtained only 
from the top, when compared to heating in a plastic 
container, cooking is not only longer but also uneven 
especially with frozen products for which the bottom layer 
is still frozen while the top layer is overcooked and 
unacceptable (dry or burnt). Plastic trays are transparent to microwave radiation 
but owing to the limited penetration of microwaves and to 
the different absorptions of microwaves by the components of 
the products e.g. water and ice, the cooking of frozen 
products is uneven. Hot spots currently appear in the 
corners and along the walls of the tray while the centre is 
still frozen. Development work in the package industry in relation to 
microwave cooking has dealt with the problem of selective 
cooking of multicomponent meals in which the 
individual food components generally require different 
quantities of microwave energy exposure.  
 For example, U.S.P. No 3'865'301 describes a shielded 
container for a plurality of ingredients of a sandwich-type 
food product that are to be heated or cooked to a different 
extent and which is opaque to microwave radiation except for 
radiation-transparent windows. U.S.P. No 4'081'646 illustrates a tray in a material 
transparent to microwave energy with a plurality of 
compartments, a cover formed of a material that is 
transparent to microwave radiation and adapted to the tray 
and a shielding box caving walls opaque to microwave energy 
and bearing apertures at predetermined locations for 
inserting the tray with the cover therein, in order to 
control the amount of radiation received by each of the 
individual components of a meal. In the prior developments very little attention has been 
paid to uneven cooking of a prepared dish

<CLAIMS>
A food package formed from a high temperature resistant 
container (10,25) having a base and a side wall (16,26) 

extending upwardly from said base to a top edge (18) which 
defines an opening, and a substantially microwave 

transparent cover (24,29) positioned over substantially all 
of either opening or the surface of the base characterised 

in that the cover has aluminium laminated depending side 
edges (19,30) adapted to be secured to a major or total part 

of the side wall (16,26). 
A food package according to claim 1 wherein the container 
(10,25) is quadrangular in shape and at least the two 

opposite side walls (16,26) comprise the aluminium laminated 
edges (19,30). 
A food package according to claim 1 wherein the depending 
side edges (19,30) of the cover (24,29) are secured to the 

side walls (16,26) of the container (10,25) by an adhesive 
or a seal or by mechanial locking. 
A food package according to claim 1 which comprises a 

microwave transparent high temperature resistant container 
(10,25) and a cardboard or plastics cover (24,29) with 

depending side walls (19,30) partially laminated along a 
major or total part of the side walls (26) with an aluminium 

foil. 
A food package according to claim 4 wherein the cardboard 
or plastics cover (24,29) is provided with fold lines 

(23,31) enabling the depending edges to contact the side 
walls (26) of the container. 
A food package according to claim 2 wherein the two 
aluminium shielded depending edges are long enough to insure  

 
a complete shield of the sides walls (26) of the container 

after folding. 
A food package according to claim 1 which comprises a 
microwave transparent high temperature resistant container 

(10,25) provided with an outer cardboard packaging 
(24,19,29,30) which is partially laminated along two side 

walls (19,30) with an aluminium foil. 
A food package according to claim 7 wherein the two 
aluminium shielded side walls (19,30) of the outer cardboard 

packaging are long enough to insure a complete shield of the 
side walls (16,26) of the container after folding. 
A food package according to claim 7 wherein the outer 
cardboard packaging covers only the bottom and side wall of 

the container. 
A food package according to claim 1 comprising a high 
temperature resistant cardboard or paperboard container 

(10,25) having a major portion of the side wall (16,26) 
laminated with an aluminium foil.
