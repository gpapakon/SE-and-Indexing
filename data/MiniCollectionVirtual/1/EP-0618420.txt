<ABSTRACT>
Radiant emitting walls (16) enclose opposite sides of a central 
combustion chamber in an oven where coated objects to be dried 

are placed or passed. The radiant emitting walls (16) generate 
primarily infrared radiation and have a nonuniform temperature 

distribution so that the temperature of the lower portion of 
the oven can be selectively adjusted to be significantly higher 

than the temperature of the upper portion. An insulated outer 
housing surrounds the radiant walls and defines combustion 

chambers (23) each having a linear burner (20) which runs 
substantially the entire length of the radiant emitting walls. 

The lower portions of the radiant emitting walls receive energy 
primarily from radiation from the linear burners and the upper 

portions of the radiant emitting walls receive energy from 
primarily radiation from the interior radiant emitting surfaces 

(15) of the insulated outer housing and convection from the 
linear burners. The temperature distribution of the radiant 

emitting walls can be selectively varied by varying the 
distance between the burners and the radiant emitting walls.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to ovens and processes 
for drying coated objects and is more particularly concerned 
with a radiant wall oven of modular construction having radiant 
emitting walls for generating infrared radiation having a 
nonuniform emission distribution. In many applications for the type of oven described in US 
Patent Nos. 4,546,552 and 4,546,553, it is extremely beneficial 
to emit primarily infrared radiation and to emit more radiant 
energy at the lower half of the oven than at the upper half. 
US patent No. 4,546553 suggested that an ideal intensity of the 
radiant energy for drying and curing coating occurs when the 
majority of the total energy emitted is radiated at wavelengths 
of about 5 microns or greater, i.e., at wavelengths within the 
infrared electromagnetic spectrum. Moreover, the need to emit 
more radiant energy at the lower half of the oven than at the 
upper half is apparent in applications where the heavier mass 
of the object to be heated or dried is substantially 
concentrated on the lower portion of the object. Examples of 
objects of this nature include an automotive body or a truck 
body. Along these lines, it has been well known in the 
industry for years that, in general, the hardest exterior 
surface to cure on a vehicle body is the rocker panel, which 
is the panel located just under the doors of the vehicle body.  In most of the prior art apparatuses, including the embodiments 
which are described in US patent Nos. 4,546,552 and 4,546,553, 
the oven architecture generally limits the degree of control 
over the temperature distribution of the radiant emitting walls 
of the ovens. In some ovens embodiments, the products of 
burner combustion, along with excess air, are delivered at a 
uniform temperature to a chamber, which is defined by walls 
including the emitting wall, for the purpose of heating the 
emitting wall uniformly. In other oven embodiments, the 
combustion chamber is direct-fired with a burner and the 
products of burner combustion within the combustion chamber are 
agitated or made turbulent, as further described in US patent 
No. 4,546,553, so as to achieve a uniform temperature 
distribution on the emitting wall. It should be noted that 
when the products of burner combustion contained in the 
combustion chamber are made turbulent, the forced-convection 
heat transfer coefficient is much greater than when there is 
laminar flow within the combustion chamber. Therefore, the 
heat transferred to the radiant emitting wall is
