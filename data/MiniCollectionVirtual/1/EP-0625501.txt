<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a method of reducing the impurity 
level in aqueous monomer solutions and, preferably, with a method of reducing the 
level of carbonyl-compound impurity in aqueous monomer solutions where one or 
more carbonyl-compounds are present as impurity. In the production of certain monomers, ethylenically unsaturated 
hydrocarbons are oxidized, usually in the presence of a suitable catalyst to form the 
desired monomer. For example, one method for producing acrylic acid is by vapor-phase 
oxidation of propylene or acrolein in the presence of a catalyst. Similarly, 
methacrylic acid can be produced by vapor-phase oxidation of isobutylene, tert-butyl 
alcohol, tertiary-butyl methyl ether, methacrolein or isobutyraldehyde. The 
products which result from these processes are aqueous solutions of monomer 
which are contaminated with undesirable by-products. The aqueous monomer 
solutions are then extracted with a suitable solvent to recover the monomer. The 
organic phase containing the monomer is then stripped of the solvent in a solvent-separation 
step to obtain the monomer product. The low-boiling impurities are then 
distilled from the monomer product. Finally, the monomer product is distilled to 
separate high-boiling impurities. Impurities in the monomer product may, for example, include carbonyl-compounds 
such as acrolein, methacrolein, acetaldehyde, furfural, protoanemonin, 
formaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, acetone and/or benzaldehyde. These by-products, 
or impurities, can impart color to the product or can act as polymerization inhibitors. 
Additional processing steps are required to reduce or remove these impurities, 
thereby increasing the cost of manufacturing pure monomer products. Three general approaches have emerged for reducing the level of carbonyl-compounds 
in aqueous monomer systems: treating the aqueous monomer solution 
resulting from the vapor-phase oxidation, treating the extracted monomer/solvent 
mixture, and treating the glacial monomer. Generally, the treatments involve one or 
more distillations or the addition of one or more selectively reactive chemical agents. A representative method of reducing by-products by treating an aqueous 
monomer solution is described in Japanese patent 62-045219. The method disclosed 
therein requires treating an aqueous acrylic acid solution with bisulfite, such as an  
 
alkali metal bisulfite or ammonium bisulfite before performing the extraction. 
Japanese patent 62-045219 discloses that this method is effective
