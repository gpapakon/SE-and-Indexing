<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a novel method of targeting biologically-active compounds to cells and organelles within cells. Specifically, the method comprises covalently linking such biologically-active compounds to a polar lipid carrier. The invention provides compositions of matter comprising such biologically-active compounds covalently linked to polar lipid carrier molecules that have the unique ability to both enhance the rate at which such biologically-active compounds cross cellular plasma membranes and to direct the compounds-lipid conjugate to specific organelles within the cell. The versatility of these conjugates may be further enhanced by including a spacer group between the drug and the lipid which may act to modulate release of the biologically-active compound at the target site. Specific embodiments of the compositions of the invention include antineoplastic and antiviral drugs. Other embodiments are provided for delivering and specific targeting of antigenically-active peptides to cells for the specific production of immunological reactivity against such peptides, as well ass compositions and pharmaceutical compositions of matter comprising such peptides. These embodiments of the invention thereby provide improved methods for vaccine production and (in vivo) vaccination against pathogenic microorganisms and methods for alleviating autoimmune disease and ameliorating tissue and organ transplant rejection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polar lipid conjugates of antigenically-active
peptides for facilitating the entry of peptides into cells and specific organelles
within the cell for the specific production of immunological responses by such
peptides. As such, this invention provides improved methods for vaccine
production and in vitro vaccination against pathogenic microorganisms, and for
alleviating autoimmune disease and ameliorating tissue and organ transplant
rejection. Vertebrate immunological responses to antigenic stimuli depend on a
phenomenon called presentation of antigens. Presentation embodies the
appearance of antigenic epitopes on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells
of the immune system in association with major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) proteins. The MHC proteins are divided into 2 classes (I & II)
whereby each class presents antigens derived from different sources. The two
types of immune response corresponding to presentation via the two types of
MHC molecules are said to be MHC class I or class II restricted. Both MHC
class I and class II restricted immunity requires presentation of peptide antigens
in association with MHC molecules (see, Abbas, Lichtman & Pober, 1991,
Cellular and Molecular Immunology (W.B. Saunders Co.: Philadelphia), pp.
116-136 for review).In the class I-restricted immune response, MHC class I molecules are
associated with peptide antigens derived from proteins made intracellularly.
Such proteins include proteins encoded by viruses and other intracellular
pathogens. These proteins are degraded in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and
the peptide products of this degradation transferred into the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) via the action of peptide-specific transporter molecules located
in the ER membrane (see, Elliott et al., 1990, Nature 348: 195-197; Parham,
1990, Nature 348: 674-675). Nascent MHC class I molecules synthesized in
the ER are assembled into functional presenting proteins only in the presence
of the appropriate peptide antigen. Fully assembled MHC class I complexes
are then transported through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, where the
antigen presenting complex can activate a cellular (T-cell mediated) immune
response by interacting with CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (see, Falk et al., 1990.
Nature 348: 248-251; Falk et al., 1991, Nature 351: 290-296). Alternatively, in the MHC class II restricted immune response
extracellular antigens (including free-living pathogens or protein components
thereof) are engulfed by cells of the
