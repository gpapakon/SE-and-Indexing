<ABSTRACT>
Polymerisable composition producing a polyurethane employed for filling biological cavities. The polyurethane is manufactured by a single-stage overall process from an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic saturated diol oligomer of molecular mass between 500 and 2000, from an aliphatic organic triisocyanate of molecular mass of less than 1000 and from an aliphatic saturated short polyol containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms. The polymerisable mixture has polymerisation characteristics which make it possible to obtain at 37@C a reaction conversion which is comparable with that obtained at an elevated temperature. Mechanical strength and the biocompatibility of the polyurethane obtained allow it to be used in the field of orthopaedic and dental surgery for long-term implants.
