<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing tear-open wrapping for packaging of items comprises the following steps: a fragilising agent is added to at least one extrudable plastic material; a film is produced by extrusion of the composition; said items are wrapped at least partially by a portion of said film and means for starting a tear are provided in said portion of film so that said wrapping can be torn in the direction defined by said tear-starting means.

A process for manufacturing a fast-opening package for the packaging of 
objects, characterised in that it comprises the following stages: 


an embrittling agent is added to at least one extrudable plastic material; 
a single-layer film is produced by monoextrusion using said composition; 
said objects are surrounded at least partly using a portion of said film and 
means are provided forming a starting point for tearing in said portion of 

the film, by which said package can be torn in the direction predetermined 
by said starting point. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that said embrittling agent is 
an ionomer based on an acid copolymer. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterised in that the ionomer is based on 

an acrylic or methacrylic acid precursor neutralised by cations. 
A process according to Claim 3, characterised in that the cations are zinc or 
sodium cations. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterised in that the acid copolymer is an 
acrylic ethyl acid or a methyl-acrylic ethyl. 
A process according to Claim 5, characterised in that said acid copolymer is 
at least partly neutralised with sodium or zinc cations. 
A process according to any one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in that said 
content by weight of embrittling agent ranges between 5 and 30%. 
A process according to Claim 5, characterised in that the content by weight of 
embrittling agent ranges between 15 and 25%.  

 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
basic plastic material is constituted by a plastic material chosen from the group 

of radical-like polyethylenes and high-density linear polyethylenes. 
A process according to Claim 9, characterised in that the plastic material is 
constituted by a mixture of at least two of these compounds. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that said 
film is produced by extrusion blow-moulding in that the drawing ratio ranges 

between 1.5 and 30 and the swelling ratio ranges between 1.5 and 5. 
A process according to Claim 11, characterised in that the drawing ratio ranges 
between 1.5 and 10. 
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the 
flow factor of the components used ranges between 0.2 and 15. 
A process according to Claim 13, characterised in that the flow factor of the 
components used ranges between 0.2 and 2 by which said film is shrinkable. 
A device for packing objects with fast opening, characterised in that it 
comprises a single-layer film of plastic material containing an embrittling agent 

obtained by monoextrusion and surrounding said objects at least partly, and 
at least one means forming a starting point for tearing, by which said package 

can be torn manually in at least one predetermined direction using said means 
forming a starting point for tearing. 
A packing device according to Claim 15 characterised in that said means 
forming a starting point for tearing comprise a pre-cut in said film. 
A packing device according to Claim 16, characterised in that said means 
forming a starting point for tearing comprise a tongue integral with said film.  

 
A packing device according to any one of Claims 15 to 17, characterised in that 
the embrittling agent is of the type defined in any one of Claims 2 to 5. 
A packing device according to any one of Claims 15 to 18, characterised in that 
said starting point for tearing is arranged in the direction of extrusion. 
A packing device according to any one of Claims 15 to 19, characterised in that 
the starting point for tearing is arranged in a direction orthogonal to the 

direction of extrusion.
