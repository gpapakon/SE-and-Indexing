<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to operating mechanisms for
master cylinders and particularly to mechanisms
fitted to handlebars of motorcycles for operation
of a hydraulic mastercylinder through a hand
operated lever.The load required to operate a hydraulic system is
proportional to the load applied to the operating
lever to build up the hydraulic pressure. The
input load acting on the operating lever is
multiplied by the ratio of the distance from the
lever pivot to the point of application of the
input load, to the distance from the lever pivot to
the point of application of the output load. This
output load may constitute the direct input to the
master cylinder or may be fed into other levers
before being fed into the master cylinder.In some applications it is known to vary the effort
required at the operating lever by varying the
lever position so that the operating feel is
adjustable as is desired by the operator. Such 
lever arrangements are shown in GB2226 112-A and in
US-A-5050381.The present application provides a means of altering the
effective lever ratio of the operating lever which is simple
and effective.Accordingly there is provided an operating lever mechanism
for hand operation of a hydraulic master cylinder, the
operating lever mechanism comprising a mounting bracket,
a lever mounted on the bracket via a pivot axis provided
by a pivot pin, the lever having a connection with a
master cylinder actuating rod characterised in that the
pivot pin is adjustably mounted on the bracket so that
the distance between the pivot axis of the lever and the
connection of the lever with the master cylinder actuating
rod can be varied to adjust the operating lever ratio as
desired.Preferably, the lever is connectable to the actuating rod at
one end of the lever, and the pivot pin is located adjacent
said one end such that when the operating load is applied at
the other end of the lever, said one end moves to apply a
pull load to the actuating rod.Conveniently the assembly includes a master 
cylinder body which is formed integrally with the
mounting bracket, and the actuating rod is coaxial
of the master cylinder bore and is connected to
lever through a screw-threaded adjustable
connection which allows the lever to be set in a
desired orientation relative to the bracket.The present invention will be described, by way of
example only, and with reference to the
accompanying drawings in which:

<CLAIMS>
An operating lever mechanism for hand operation of a
hydraulic master cylinder, the operating lever

mechanism comprising a mounting bracket (12), a lever
(23) mounted on the bracket via a pivot axis (22A)

provided by a pivot pin (22), the lever having a
connection with a master cylinder actuating rod (25)

characterised in that the pivot pin (22) is adjustably
mounted on the bracket (12) so that the distance

between the pivot axis (22A) of the lever and the
connection of the lever with the master cylinder

actuating rod can be varied to adjust the operating
lever ratio as desired.
A lever mechanism as claimed in Claim 1 characterised
in that the lever (23) is connectable to the actuating

rod (25) at one end (24) of the lever, and the
pivot pin (22) is located adjacent said one end (24)

such that when an operating load is applied to the
other end (26) of the lever, said one end (24) moves

to apply a pull load to the actuating rod (25).
A lever operating mechanism as claimed in Claim 1 or 2
wherein the bracket (12) includes a pair of aligned

slots (27) in which the pivot pin (22) is slideably
guided, the pin (22) being screw-threadedbly connected 

to a screw strut (29) having an adjuster wheel (31)
thereon so that operation of the adjuster wheel

causes the pin (22) to move along the strut (29)
guided by the slots (27).
A lever mechanism as claimed in Claim 3 characterised
in that the pivot pin (22) is connected to the

mounting bracket (12) through bearings (28) located
one bearing at each end of the pin, the bearings

engaging in a respective aligned slot (27) in the
bracket (12).
A lever mechanism as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
4 characterised in that the lever (23) is connectable

to the actuating rod (25) through a screw-threaded
adjustable connection (35,42,43,44,46,47) which

allows the lever (23) to be set in a desired
orientation relative to the bracket.
A lever mechanism as claimed in Claim 5 characterised
in that the screw-threaded connection comprises a

spherical nut (42) having an adjuster wheel (44)
affixed thereto.
A lever mechanism as claimed in claim 5 characterised
in that the screw-threaded connection comprises a

screw-threaded bore in a pin (145) which extends
through the lever (23), the screw threaded bore being 

engaged by a screw-threaded portion (35) of the
actuating rod (25), and in that the actuating rod is

rotatable to adjust the lever orientation.
A lever mechanism as claimed in claim 7 characterised
in that detent means (47,48) are provided in the

screw-threaded connection to hold the lever (23) in
discrete adjusted orientations.
A master cylinder assembly including a operating lever
mechanism as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 8, the

assembly being characterised by the inclusion of a
master cylinder body (16) formed integrally with the

mounting bracket (12).
An assembly as claimed in Claim 9 characterised in
that the master cylinder body (16) has a master

cylinder bore (17) therein having a mouth (18) and a
closed end and in which a piston (33) is sealingly

reciprocal, and the actuating rod (25) is arranged
coaxially of the bore and is connected at one end to

the piston, the rod being sealingly guided in a
bearing cap (34) which closes the mouth of the bore.
