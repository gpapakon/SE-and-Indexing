<ABSTRACT>
A watch-type electric device having circuit wiring like an antenna in a band, which 
comprises a containing portion (1a) in a band, a piling portion (1b) extending to the 

circumference where a case (3) overlaps with a case back (4), and a connecting portion 
(1c) disposed inwardly from the piling portion, which are formed on a wiring substrate 

(1) having plasticity. Thus the connection of the antenna in the band is achieved with no 
mechanical connections and hence the band can rotate on the case.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a watch-type electric device having circuit 
wiring, like an antenna, in a band. As shown in Fig. 4, a band antenna conventionally has a construction such that a 
connecting terminal 14 is inserted into synthetic rubber so as to expose one end thereof 
toward a case 11 in a band body 12. In order to connect electrically the connecting terminal 14 with a circuit substrate 
on which an electronic circuit is provided, one end of the connecting terminal 14 projects 
from the band body 12 and is connected electrically and mechanically with a connector 
15 by calking. The connector 15 is inserted into a through hole 11a formed at the side 
of the case 11. The edge of the connector 15 is connected electrically with an elastically 
deformed contact spring 17 which is conductive with the electronic circuit provided in 
the inside of the case. Furthermore, in order to enable the case to be waterproof, a 
connector gasket 16 is provided so as to fit into the through hole 11a. The construction, 
as shown in Fig. 5, has been known such that the band body 12 is fixed to the case 11 
with a band fixing screw 19 in order that any external force doesn't affect the calking 
portion between the connector 15 and the connecting terminal 14. The above 
conventional construction is disclosed for example in Japanese laid-open patent JP-A-4-25224 
(1992). However, a conventional watch-type electric device having circuit wiring like an 
antenna in a band has the following problem. As shown in Fig. 5, the band body 12 is fastened to the case 11 with a screw. 
This disables the band body 12 from rotating on the case 11. Therefore, when the band  
 
body 12 is put on the arm, there appears an opening between the arm and the band. That 
means the fit between the two is inferior. When wiring is provided to both sides of the band, the connecting parts should be 
disposed at both sides thereof on the constitution of the electronic circuit even if both 
sides share the same wiring. An aim of the present invention is to improve the fit of a band and to reduce the 
number of parts, thereby improving the waterproof characteristics of the watch.
 
According to the present invention, there is provided an electronic device having circuit 
wiring in a board comprising:
 
   a wiring substrate having a portion in the band;
 
   a case having a piling portion of the wiring substrate and a connecting portion 
sandwiched by two gaskets; and
