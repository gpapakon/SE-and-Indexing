<ABSTRACT>
A connecting terminal (1) for electric apparatus 
comprises a plate-like body (2) having at least one 

shaped portion (7) formed by blanking from the body 
itself and adapted to define a fitting seat (8) for an 

end portion (6) of a thread-like electric conductor (4), 
the shaped portion (7) being deformable by squeezing so 

that it fixedly engages the end portion (6) of said 
electric conductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connecting terminal 
for electric apparatus of the type comprising a plate-like 
body engaged to an electric apparatus and adapted 
to define a contact with an end portion of an electric 
thread-like conductor. It is known that connecting terminals for electric 
apparatus and devices such as switches, double-throw 
switches, optical signallers, pressure meters, 
thermostats and in general all components passed through 
by medium-intensity current flows, say until 16 A, as it 
happens for example in the field of household 
appliances, consist of flat connectors each formed with 
a plate-like body made of a material having a high 
electric conductivity, engaged to the apparatus itself 
and emerging therefrom. Ending at said plate-like body is the bare end portion, 
that is devoid of the outer insulating sheath, of a 
thread-like electric conductor of the rigid or flexible 
type, which is to be connected thereto. Connections of a thread-like electric conductor to said 
plate-like bodies may take place according to different 
modalities in order to ensure an appropriate electric 
contact in time, avoiding any slackening which will 
bring about sparkings between the parts above all in the 
presence of vibrations or tractive stresses in use. For example provision may be made for the use of a 
connecting element integral with the ends of the thread-like 
conductor and adapted to be fitted on the flat 
connector of the apparatus. This known connecting element is substantially formed 
with a plate having, at one end, a hooking appendage  
 
clasping the end portion of the thread-like electric 
conductor, devoid of the insulating sheath and, at the 
other end, two spaced apart and undulated portions. The latter portions practically define with their edges 
and in cooperation with a flat portion of the connecting 
element, a seat of appropriate sizes into which, by 
virtue of the material elasticity, the flat connector 
integral with the electric apparatus can be forcedly 
introduced. However, the mechanical and electric connecting 
technique briefly described above has some drawbacks. In fact, above all a specific step is required for 
fastening the hooking appendage of the connecting 
element to the thread-like electric conductor. Subsequently the tight fitting of the flat connector of 
the apparatus in the seat of the connecting element 
generally involves an important effort because obviously 
coupling must be conveniently forced in order to avoid 
the occurrence of
