<ABSTRACT>
In a solid material flow-separating method for separating 
fine solid material from fluid, plural massive, net-shaped or 

pipe-shaped flow-separating members each having opening portions 
of about 1 to 5cm in equivalent diameter are disposed along a 

fluid flowing direction in a treatment tank, and the fine solid 
material floating in the fluid is trapped and collected through 

the opening portions, and held up in a predetermined area, 
thereby separating the fine solid material from the fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for separating
floating fine solid material from liquid, particularly to a
method for separating floating fine solid material from liquid
for conducting a separation treatment on fine solid material
in liquid, and more particularly to a method
for separating fine solid pollutant floating in polluted
water.Various kinds of methods have been conventionally
proposed and used to purify polluted water such as various
kinds of waste water, river water polluted by the waste
water, etc.For example, FR-A-1 578 228 discloses a method for
purifying polluted water, wherein the polluted water flows
from a distribution chamber of a tank through several
adjacent horizontal tubes and is collected in another chamber
at the discharge end of the tubes. Particles suspended in
the polluted water are deposited on the lower surfaces of the
tubes, so that purified water leaves the tubes into the
chamber at the end of the tubes.Furthermore, DE 31 49 545 C1 discloses an apparatus for
separating suspended particles from fluids, wherein thick
walls arranged parallel to the flowing direction comprise a
plurality of channels formed perpendicular to the flowing 
direction. Particles suspended in a fluid, particular gas,
tend to flow towards the region adjacent to the walls and
into the openings of the channels and are separated from the
fluid as soon as they move into the channels. However, the
channels have a diameter of at the most 10 mm so that they
are not suitable for separating solid material from liquid
fluids. Furthermore, due to the required thickness of the
walls in order to avoid turbulences passing through the
channels this known method requires an apparatus of
complicated structure.Finally, DE-A-24 49 355 discloses a method and an
apparatus for changing the concentration of suspended
materials, wherein energy, such as vibration is applied to
the suspended material and the resulting movement of the
suspended material is used for separating the suspended
material. This method also requires a complicated apparatus
and cannot provide an economic method for separating floating
fine solid material from liquid.Other known purifying methods for the polluted water are mainly
classified into the following two methods. One method is (1) a
chemical treatment method in which pollutant in polluted water
is subjected to a chemical treatment to make the pollutant
harmless, and the pollutant is agglomerated and precipitated to
separate the pollutant from the water, and the other method is
(2) a

A method for separating floating fine solid material from
liquid, comprising the steps of:


disposing plural separating members made from flat sheet
like material, whose surfaces are in use at least

partially in contact with liquid and have opening
portions with an equivalent diameter greater than 1 cm

and less than about 5 cms, in flowing liquid; and
collecting and holding up the fine solid material
floating in the liquid through the opening portions in a

predetermined area located at the bottom portions of the
separating members or formed by a closed area, for which

at least partially the separating members serve as a
boundary, thereby separating the fine solid material from

the liquid.
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the liquid is
polluted water, and further comprising the steps of

collecting and holding up fine solid pollutant floating
in the polluted water, thereby performing purification

treatment for the polluted water.
A method for separating floating fine solid material from
liquid, comprising the steps of:


disposing plural massive separating members, whose
surfaces are in use at least partially in contact with

flowing liquid, the separating members being formed of
plural aggregate particles with gap intervals between the

particles, the gap intervals forming first opening 
portions on the surfaces of the separating members, whose

equivalent diameter is greater than 1 cm and less than
about 3 cms, the gap intervals furthermore forming plural

flow passageways which are continuously penetrated to
second opening portions on the surfaces of the separating

members also formed by the gap intervals; and
collecting said fine solid material floating in the
liquid through said first opening portions and holding up

said fine solid material in said flow passageways.
The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein said massive
members are arranged in stripe form in parallel to the

flowing direction to form striped separating member
layers, and wherein a slender groove is formed at the

bottom of each of said layers.
