<DESCRIPTION>
 Background of the Invention Carboxv Terminal IL-6 MuteinsThe present invention is directed to a mutein of Interleukin 6, its production by recombinant DNA technology, and its theraputic use.Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that is produced by a variety of cells such as B-cells, T-cells, monocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. IL-6 exhibits several activities relating to the proliferation and/or differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. These activities result from IL-6 acting alone or in combination with other cytokines such as IL-3 and IL-4. Some specific biological effects of IL-6 include terminal differentiation of B-cells, proliferation and differentiation of T-cells, regulation of the acute phase response, growth regulation of epithelial cells, the differentiation of megakaryocytes, and thrombopoiesis. In accordance with these activities and effects, the target cells fo IL-6 include B-cells, T-cells, myeloma cells, megakaryocytes, monocytes, early stem cells and hepatocytes.Though IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine, the various biological effects it exerts are believed to be initiated by the stepwise interaction of IL-6 with two distinct receptor subunits on a cell. IL-6 first forms a complex with an 80 kD receptor subunit. This complex binds to a non-ligand subunit, which is a membrane glycoprotein designated gpl30. The binding of the IL-6- 80kD receptor complex to gpl30 results in signal transduction.The amino acid sequence of IL-6 has been described in the literature as containing 185 amino acids starting with alanine as residue 1.; see, for example, Figure 2A of Brakenhoff et al., J. Immunol . 139, 4116-4121 (1987) and Figure 1 of Clark et al., PCT application WO 88/00206. These references also contain the cDNA sequence that corresponds to native IL-6 mRNA.The carboxy terminus of IL-6 has been found to be the 

 receptor binding region. (See Leebeek, F.W.G., et al., "Identification of a Receptor Binding Site in the Carboxyl Terminus of Human Interleukin-6", Journal of Biological Chemistry in press) Analysis of the structure of the carboxy terminal 5 region of several cytokines, including IL-6, has shown the bindin region to be highly conserved. Lokker, N., et al., EMBO J. , 10, (8) 2125-2131 (1991). See page 2130, top of col. 1.; BAZAN, Immunology Today 11. 350-354 (1990). According to Lokker et al., "[Substitutions in the ... C-terminal proximal regions of these 10 molecules abolished their activity."New techniques in molecular biology, such as recombinant DNA
