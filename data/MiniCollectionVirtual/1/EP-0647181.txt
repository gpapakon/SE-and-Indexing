<ABSTRACT>
In a sandwich structure which comprises two outer layers (1) fastened to core material (2) which is cut into shaped pieces, preferably to form a checkered pattern, which define gaps (4) therebetween, the gaps (4) are filled with an elastomeric, rubber-like material of a thermosetting resin type. This material is preferably introduced into the gaps in a flowable state, either by injecting the filler under pressure or by suction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sandwich structure 
which is comprised of a cellular-plastic core sandwiched 
between two reinforcing layers made, for instance, of 
metal or of a laminated fibre-glass fabric. The core is 
built-up of individual, cut shapes, preferably disposed 
in a checkered pattern, wherein the gaps defined by 
adjacent shapes are filled with a binder. In the following, 
the core material is referred to as checkered cut 
material, although it will be understood that the pattern 
formed by the cut shapes need not be a checkered pattern. Such sandwich structures are known, for instance, from SE-A-89 
00 981-5 (EP-A-0 389 456), in which the binder used is comprised 
of a filler to which small plastic spheres have been 
added, this filler completely filling the aforesaid gaps 
and thereby providing a structure of high mechanical 
strength. Checkered cut core material has been used 
hitherto because of the need to be able to manufacture 
arched or curved sandwich structures. Flat, imperforate 
sheets are normally used for the manufacture of flat 
sandwich structures. One particular problem relating to lightweight sandwich 
structures is that because these structures are both 
rigid and light in weight, they are prone to oscillate 
within the acoustic frequency range and become sound 
conducting. This has been found especially troublesome 
in ships, boats and vehicles in particular. For example, 
oscillations or vibrations can be induced in the hull of 
a boat by the boat motor, these oscillations, or vibrations, 
being so pronounced as to prevent conversation in  
 
a normal speaking voice. The lightweight, rigid material 
from which the outer skin or shell and the deck of a 
vessel are made thus transmits bodyborne sound. The 
vibrations concerned may also cause the occurrence of 
fatigue phenomena. Although such bodyborne sound can be eliminated by increasing 
the mass of the sandwich structure, this would 
eliminate a large part of the advantages afforded by the 
lightweight but nevertheless strong sandwich material. Accordingly, a first object of the present invention is 
to provide a sandwich structure of the aforedescribed 
kind which inhibits the occurrence of bodyborne sound in 
constructions built from such material structures. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
general sound-damping material, by which is meant a 
material which can be used for sound insulation purposes 
between rooms for instance, and which thus dampens airborne 
sound. These and other

<CLAIMS>
Sandwich structure comprising core material constructed 
from cellular plastic and an outer reinforcement 

layer glued to each side of the core, said core material 
being cut into separate shaped pieces, preferably disposed 

in a checkered pattern, such as to define therebetween 
binder filled gaps, 
characterized
 in 
that the binder used is a sound-damping elastomeric and 

polymeric material. 
A sandwich structure according to Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the elastomeric polymer 
material is a thermosetting resin. 
A sandwich structure according to Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the binder used in the 
gaps has a mechanical loss factor η which exceeds 30%, 

and preferably exceeds 40% within the frequency range of 
200-2000 Hz. 
A sandwich structure according to Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the binder used in the 
gaps has a hardness of up to 10-75, preferably within the 

range of 20-30, as measured in Shore D. 
A sandwich structure according to Claim 1 or 2, 

characterized
 in that the binder used in the 
gaps is a polyurethane glue. 
A sandwich structure according to Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the cut core material 
is a closed-cell foamed PVC-plastic.  

 
A sandwich structure according to Claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the core structure 
comprises two sheets of cut material which sandwich 

therebetween a binder of the same kind as that used in 
sai
d gaps. 
A method for manufacturing a sandwich structure 
according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 by 
first gluing a respective reinforcement layer on both 

sides of a cut, extended core material, preferably with 
the aid of a glue having a loss factor η of preferably 

40% within the frequency range of 200-2000 Hz; 
standing the material structure on edge and injecting 

into the gaps defined by in the cut core material, 
upwardly through bottom openings, a flowable elastomeric 

thermosetting material which has a high loss factor in 
its hardened state, such that all air present in the gaps 

will be displaced therefrom through openings in the top 
of the sandwich structure, and then allowing the thermosetting 

material to set. 
A method according to Claim 8, 
characterized
 
by placing at least at the bottom of the 

reinforcement layers means which will function to exert 
a counter-pressure against the outer surface of said 

layers so as to prevent the layers from being separated 
from the core material as the elastomeric thermosetting 

material is injected into said gaps. 
A method according to Claim 8, 
characterized
 
by applying a vacuum at the top of the 

openings.
