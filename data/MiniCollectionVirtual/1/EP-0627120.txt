<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention has its most important 
application in automotive fuses designed for circuits 
handling normal currents substantially greater than 80 
amps generated at the low voltages produced by storage 
batteries. These high current automotive fuses are to be 
contrasted with the plug-in blade fuses disclosed, for 
example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,635,023. This patent 
discloses a fuse now commonly used in vehicle circuits 
having current ratings of only up to about 80 amps. 
However, the invention is also useful in fuses with 
current ratings below 80 amps.  
 The automobile blade-type plug-in fuse 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,635,023 is a two-piece 
assembly having a thin, box-like housing and a platelike, 
all metal plug-in fuse element secured therein. 
The metal plug-in fuse element has a pair of spaced, 
confronting, exposed terminal blades extending from one 
side of the housing. These terminal blades plug into 
pressure clip socket terminals. Current-carrying 
extensions of the terminal blades extend into the housing 
where they are closely encompassed by the housing walls. 
A fuse link unsupported between the ends thereof extends 
suspended between the current-carrying extensions and is 
spaced from the housing side walls. The fuse link of this and other types of fuses 
including the fuses of the present invention melts and 
sometimes vaporizes under fuse blowing conditions. These 
fuses generally are designed to blow under both prolonged 
modest overload current like 135% of rated current within 
½ hour or instantly under short circuit current. Under 
such a prolonged modest overload current the temperature 
of the fuse link progressively rises until the fuse opens 
the circuit involved. The temperature rise in the fuse 
link results from electrical power dissipation in the 
electrical resistance R of the fuse link material due to 
electrical current I flow therethrough. The formula 
describing this power dissipation P is P = I2R. Under normal operation (normal current is 
usually about 70% of rated current), the heat dissipated 
in the fuse link is sufficiently small that a large 
section of the fuse link does not melt or even soften. 
Heat generated in the fuse link is conducted into the 
terminal blade portions, housing and panel socket clips. 
When a current substantially above rated current (like 
135% thereof) flows in the link, the heat dissipation is 
such that there is an insufficient rate of conduction of 
heat therefrom so that the temperature rises to the 
temperature

<CLAIMS>
An automobile-type high current fuse comprising a metal 
portion (20A) formed by an integral piece of metal having 

outermost spaced terminal-forming portions (26,26') and a fuse 
link-forming intermediate portion (27) wider than its thickness 

between said terminal-forming portions (26,26'), said terminal-forming portions (26, 26') being of substantially greater width than the intermediate portion (27), said terminal-forming portions (26, 26') having bolt anchoring holes (28) therein on portions projecting either end of a housing (20B) defining a central space around the link-forming portion (27), housing-anchoring holes (31,31') and faces 
(26a,26a') from which said intermediate portion (27) extends 

having a first outer leg (27a) connected only to one (26a) of 
said faces at one lateral margin thereof and a second outer leg 

(27a') connected only to the other (26a') of said faces of the 
said metal piece (20A) at the lateral margin thereof opposite to 

the said one lateral margin, said fuse link-forming intermediate 
portion (27) providing a desired overall resistance which 

provides a desired delay in the time a given overload current 
flow which will melt said fuse link-forming portion and open the 

fuse, and under short circuit conditions will blow quickly,
 
characterised in that the terminal-forming portions (26,26') of the integral piece of metal are of substantially 

greater thickness than the intermediate portion (27) 
and in that the outer legs (27a,27a') of said link-forming 

portion (27) are connected by an intermediate leg (27b) making a 
reverse inclination with the adjacent legs (27a,27a') whereby to maximise the 

mass of the fuse link within said space, whereby the high-current fuse can be 
made to desirably small dimensions.  

 
The fuse of claim 1 wherein said housing (20B) has 
identical confronting housing halves (20b,20b') having sides 

placed in confronting relationship along a given plane, each of 
said confronting housing halves (20b,20b') defining the central 

space therebetween from which said fuse link-forming portion 
(27) of said metal piece (20A) is spaced, said housing (20B) 

having surfaces which envelope and seal around the terminal-forming 
portions (26,26') of the metal portion (20A) of the 

fuse, each housing half (20b,20b') having at least one 
positioning pin (30,30') projecting through a pin-receiving hole 

(31,31') in one of the terminal-forming portions (26,26') of 
said metal piece (20A) and one housing half (20b) being rotated 

180° in said given plane with respect to the other housing half 
(20b') so that said pins (30,30') and said pin-receiving holes 

(31,31') of said housing halves (20b,20b') are at opposite sides 
thereof. 
The fuse of claim 1 wherein said housing (20B) 
comprises confronting housing halves (20b,20b'). 
The fuse of claim 1 wherein said fuse link-forming 
portion (27) is S-shaped.  

 
The fuse of claim 1 wherein said fuse link-forming 
portion (27) of said metal piece (20A) has a portion which 

includes spaced areas (47) of reduced cross-sectional areas

expected to melt and open under prolonged overload currents, and
