<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for anchoring beams together or to one or more other structural elements. A wedge-shaped beam attachment (10) is intended to straddle respective beams and can be fitted in any selected position along the beam. The attachment includes a short leg (12) and a long leg (14) which define an angle of 90 degrees with one another. An angled collar (16) on the short leg (12) is bent through 90 degrees and the outer end of the long leg (14) is bent through an angle of about 105 degrees. This bent outer end of the long leg (14) forms an abutment spring (18) which fonctions to urge a wedge (23) resiliently against the side edge of a beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device of the kind 
defined in the preamble of Claim 1. Different types of beams are used as load-bearing 
devices in building and construction work. The traditional 
I-beam is perhaps the most common beam used in 
this respect. In the construction of a building, for 
instance, it is often necessary to anchor different 
auxiliaries to such beams for a longer or shorter 
period of time, in order to facilitate building work 
or to join together various building elements or 
structural elements which include a profiled beam 
section or the like. Hitherto, this has been effected, 
particularly in the case of wooden beams, by nailing 
the building element concerned to the beams, or by 
drilling holes and securing said building element with 
the aid of nuts and bolts. These anchoring methods are 
relatively time-consuming and the building elements 
thus anchored cannot be readily released or removed 
when their functional task has been completed. Moreover, 
the strength of the join thus obtained is determined 
arbitrarily, for instance depending on how and 
where the nails are driven into the beams or where and 
how the bolts are positioned, and the forces acting in 
the joins are transferred in a punctiform fashion in 
the interface between the elements. An anchoring device for a tubular scaffolding system is previously known from 
EP-A-76 774 and comprises vertical elements carrying brackets, each of which 
receives a fork on the end of a horizontal cross-member. The top of the fork contains 
a slot in which a conical pin is held captive. When not in use, the pin rests in a horizontal position along the top of the 
cross-member. In use, the pin is pivoted into a vertical position in which it passes 
through the slot and locates into another slot in the bottom of the fork, so securing the 
cross-member to the bracket. However, this system is not applicable to a beam anchoring device as defined in the 
introduction. It is, therefore, desirable to improve the aforesaid anchoring methods 
with the aid of an anchorage device which can be 
handled simply, which is cheap to manufacture and 
which can be quickly anchored to and removed from a 
load-bearing construction element, for instance an 
I-beam. The object of the invention is therefore to provide a 
device of the aforesaid kind which has properties that 
will eliminate the aforesaid drawbacks.  
  
 This object is achieved with a device of the kind 
defined in the preamble and having the characteristic 
features set forth

<CLAIMS>
A device for anchoring beams, to one another or to other structural elements, 
comprising a beam attachment (10) which has a generally U-shaped configuration so 

as to be able to straddle a beam when fitted thereon, and which attachment includes a 
first leg (12), a second leg (14) and an angled collar (16), said legs extending generally at right 

angles (α) to one another and the outer extremities of each of said legs being bent at a 
respective predetermined angle β and γ, 
characterised in
 that the angled collar (16) is 
formed on the first leg (12) and a locking device (23) is mounted in a slot (22) in the 

second leg (14), the locking device (23) being movable through the slot between the 
first leg (12) and the outer end (18) of said second leg (14), the side of said locking 

device (23) opposite said first leg (12) being in contact only with the endmost portion 
of said outer end (18) of said second leg (14), whereby said outer end serves as an 

abutment spring (18) to urge said locking device (23) toward said first leg (12).  
 
A device according to Claim 1 in combination with a beam (2), 
characterized
 
in that the beam is an I-beam (2) and 

the locking device (23) is pressed against one 
edge of the beam in such a way that 

the point of engagement of the pressure force with an 
edge of a beam flange is spaced from the outer surface 

of the beam flange by a distance corresponding to at 
least half the width of the flange. 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the locking device is a wedge 

(23) whose side edges (25, 26) converge towards one 
another in a direction away from a hammer plate (24) 

towards a wedge apex (27). 
A device according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the converging angle assumes 

values in the range of 10 to 15 degrees. 
A device according to any of Claims 1-4, 

characterized
 in that the angle β is 90 
degrees and the angle γ assumes values in the range of 

65-80 degrees.
