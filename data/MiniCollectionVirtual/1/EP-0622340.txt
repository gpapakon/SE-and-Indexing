<ABSTRACT>
An improvement is proposed in the method for the preparation 
of a transparent synthetic silica glass body by the flame hydrolysis 

of a vaporizable silane compound by using, in an embodiment, 
a pentafold concentrically multitubular burner nozzle to 

deposit the fine silica particles on a substrate with simultaneous 
fusion into transparent glass. According to the inventive improvement, 

a gaseous mixture of the silane vapor and oxygen is introduced 
into the center nozzle of the burner while oxygen is also introduced 

into the first and third ring nozzles surrounding the center 
nozzle and hydrogen is introduced into the second and fourth 

ring nozzles while the total feed rate of oxygen is controlled in a 
range of fr
om 50% to 90% of the stoichiometrically equivalent rate 
required for complete combustion and flame hydrolysis of hydrogen 

and silane vapor. When this requirement is satisfied, the contents 
of hydroxyl groups and molecular hydrogen in the silica glass 

can be controlled within optimum ranges so as to ensure excellent 
stability of the optical properties of the silica glass against irradiation 

with ultraviolet light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation 
of a synthetic silica glass body or, more particularly, relates to an 
improvement in the method for the preparation of a synthetic silica 
glass body by the flame hydrolysis of a volatile silicon-containing 
compound in an oxyhydrogen flame blown at the surface of a 
refractory substrate so as to deposit the fine silica particles produced 
by the flame hydrolysis of the silicon compound on the substrate 
surface with simultaneous fusion of the silica particle deposit into 
a transparent silica glass body which is imparted with improved 
stability in the optical properties against irradiation of ultraviolet 
light from excimer lasers and the like. As is well known, one of the methods for the preparation of a 
synthetic silica glass body is a so-called direct flame hydrolysis 
method in which vapor of a volatile silicon-containing compound 
such as silicon tetrachloride, alkoxy silane compounds and the like 
is subjected to combustion or vapor-phase hydrolysis in an oxyhydrogen 
flame to form fine particles of silicon dioxide or silica which 
are blown at and deposited on the surface of a substrate of silica 
glass with simultaneous in situ sintering and vitrification into a 
transparent synthetic silica glass body by the heat of combustion  
 
of the combustible silicon compound and the heat of the oxyhydrogen 
flame blown at the substrate surface. The synthetic silica glass bodies prepared in the above described 
direct flame hydrolysis method are widely used as a base 
material of various parts of optical instruments such as lenses, 
prisms and the like by virtue of the high transmissivity to ultraviolet 
light and other excellent and desirable optical properties. 
Synthetic silica glass, however, can never be satisfactory in all respects 
as a material of optical parts. When a lens made from such a 
synthetic silica glass body is prolongedly used in an optical system 
for ultraviolet light of which the light source is an excimer laser, 
for example, certain optical properties of the lens, such as transmissivity 
to light, refractive index, appearance of luminescent 
emission and the like, are subject to variation or changes not to ensure 
stability of the optical system. Many investigations have already 
been undertaken for the mechanism of this disadvantageous 
phenomenon in the optical properties of the synthetic silica glass 
and it is now understood that the instability of synthetic silica 
glass against ultraviolet light is closely
