<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wood preservative composition 
having an improved fixing ability in wood, process for 
treating wood with such wood preservative composition, and 
wood treated with such wood preservative composition. It has been conventionally known that compositions 
containing a specified kind of metal compound or inorganic 
compound as main component effectively serve as wood preservative 
composition. Metal compounds of these compositions include copper 
compounds such as copper acetate, chromium compounds such as 
copper chromate, potassium chromate, and sodium dichromate, 
and mercury compounds such as mercuric chloride. Inorganic compounds of these compositions include 
arsenic compounds such as arsenious acid, fluorine compounds 
such as sodium fluoride, boron compounds such as boric acid 
and borax. These compounds are mixed in a desired combination to 
obtain a wood preservative composition in the form of an 
aqueous solution. Fixing agent such as acetic acid and 
ammonia are often added to such aqueous solution. Thus obtained composition is impregnated into wood to  
 
produce wood capable of keeping wood-attacking organisms 
from growing therein. These compositions originally have a 
wood preserving effect. The composition impregnated into 
wood are fixed in the wood through chemical reactions which 
take place between preservative components and between a 
preservative component and the wood. However, most of these 
compositions are poorly fixed in the wood and cannot display 
the wood preserving effect over a long period of time. These compositions have another problems, too. For 
example, out of components of these compositions, arsenic 
compounds are fatally toxic and heavy metal compounds such 
as chromium compounds and mercury compounds are considerably 
toxic. Accordingly, it is necessary to carefully handle 
these compositions when they are impregnated into wood so as 
not to risk workers' health, let alone to carefully prepare 
them. It is also necessary to carefully discard unnecessary 
pieces of wood treated with such a composition, which pieces 
are inevitably produced when the wood is cut into a desired 
form, and old wood products to prevent an environmental 
pollution. Reflecting the above problems, in recent years, an 
attention has been turned to the use of an aqueous solution, 
as a wood preservative composition, containing as a main 
component copper borate or zinc borate in place of chromium 
compounds and arsenic compounds, and a volatile basic compound.
