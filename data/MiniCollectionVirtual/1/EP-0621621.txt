<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to current limiting fuses. Current limiting fuses typically have one or more 
fusible elements connecting two conducting terminals within 
an insulative housing. One type of fuse construction employs a housing made 
of a tubular casing of melamine glass, cardboard, or 
thermoset polymer resins in a matrix with glass or papers. 
The ends of the tubes are typically closed with end caps, 
which go around the ends of the tube, or end blocks of 
brass or copper, which are inside of the tube at the ends. 
When end blocks are employed, there often are terminal 
blades that are located on the outer surfaces of the end 
blocks (being either integral with or attached such as by 
welding or brazing to the end blocks), and fusible elements 
are connected, e.g. by welding, in grooves to the inside 
surfaces of the end blocks. US Patent No. US-A-O 973 250 (Barricklow) describes a 
different type of fuse construction in which the insulative 
housing is made of two pieces that have been bolted 
together. In one aspect, the invention features, in general, 
making an insulative fuse housing by ultrasonically welding 
together housing pieces made of thermoplastic material. 
The thermoplastic material has a continuous use temperature 
greater than 110°C (most preferably greater than 120°C) to 
provide structural integrity at elevated temperatures to 
which fuses are subjected in use. The material includes 
filler (e.g., fiber glass) in a range between 20% 
and 40% (most preferably between 30% and 35%) to 
have enough filler to provide a significant increase 
of the continuous use temperature of the  
 
thermoplastic material but to not have so much filler as 
to prevent bonding by ultrasonic welding. Suitable 
thermoplastic materials include highly crystalline Nylon 
4.6, polyphthalamide, polyphenylene sulfide, and liquid 
crystal polymer. In another aspect, the invention features, in 
general, a fuse including a fuse housing made from two or 
more housing pieces made from molded thermoplastic 
material. The housing has end walls with openings 
through which terminals pass. The housing also has inner 
walls that are integral with and spaced from respective 
end walls and have surfaces that define passages that are 
aligned with the openings. The terminals are supported 
by the end walls around the openings and by the surfaces 
of the inner walls defining the passages. This 
arrangement provides good support for the terminals 
without relying on a concentrated mass of thermoplastic 
material adjacent
