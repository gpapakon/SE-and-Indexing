<ABSTRACT>
2. In an apparatus which is designed for the incorporation of a filter element 1, which is located in a housing component 9, the outer wall of which is positioned against a receiving body 21 in a sealing manner, the latter is fixed to an interior wall 17 of the holder 3 by means of a sealing connection. This sealing connection is provided with a sealing element 35 introduced between sealing surfaces of the receiving body 21 and the interior wall 17. A holding device for fixing the position of the filter element 1 in the housing component 9 is provided with a pressing member 41, which, by engaging with the filter element 1, secures this against a rotary movement relative to the housing component 9.

Apparatus for receiving a filter element (1) in a housing 
part (9), which comprises an inlet and outlet opening for a fluid 

and on the latter a seat (15), against which the filter element 
(1) can be pressed by means of a retaining device, which 

comprises a pressing member (41; 51) able to be applied against 
a contact surface on the end face of the filter element (1), a 

sealing member (16) on the seat (15) separating the unfiltered 
fluid from the filtered and the housing part (9) being in sealed 

abutment with a receiving body (21) by a region (25) of its outer 
wall by way of a second sealing member (27), which receiving body 

(21) can be attached to a wall (17) of a container (3) in sealed 
connection by means of a third sealing member (35) and associated 

retaining members (31, 33), characterised in that the pressing 
member (41; 51) of the retaining device is formed by a retaining 

bracket (41; 71) arranged to tilt on the receiving body (21; 61) 
by way of a hinge-like arrangement (43; 64), which retaining 

bracket can be releasably fixed in its working position bearing 
against the contact surface of the filter element (1), and that 

the retaining bracket (41; 71) comprises at least one contact 
surface (46), which in the working position can be brought into 

positive engagement with a counter-surface (40) formed on the 
contact surface of the filter element (1), in order to protect 

the filter element (1) against rotation relative to the housing 
part (9). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
contact surface on the retaining bracket (41; 71) is formed by 

the edges of at least one slit opening (46) provided on the 
latter, which is intended for the engagement of a projecting 

tongue (40) provided on the contact surface of the filter element 
(1), which tongue forms the counter-surface. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the retaining bracket (41; 71) can be connected to the receiving 

body (21; 61) by means of a screw connection (31, 33).  
 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the retaining bracket (71) is produced from a flexible 

synthetic material and is arranged to tilt on the receiving body 
(61) by way of a flexible region forming a bending hinge (64). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised in that at 
its end region opposite the bending hinge (64), the retaining 

bracket (71) can be fixed to the receiving body (61) in the 
working position by means of a snap-action connection (82, 83) 

or a plug-in connection (74, 75, 76).
