<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a universal remote
control in which function codes for generating operating code
signals to be transmitted by the remote control are synthesized
or generated by the operator of or external to the remote
control by depressing certain keys or buttons on the remote
control identified in an accompanying list, or by transmitting
information to it.Universal remote controls are typically handheld devices
capable of emitting infrared light modulated with information,
which when received by equipment capable of processing such
information, can control various functions of the equipment.
A remote control is commonly called universal if it can send IR
signals modulated by the codes pertaining to a wide variety of
equipment, usually manufactured by different companies.Presently, universal remote controls are of two principal
types: learning, wherein the user can "teach" the universal
remote control functions emitted by an existing "native" remote
control; and pre-programmed, wherein the universal remote
control is manufactured with codes to control a variety of
equipment already in its memory. One example of a learning
remote control is disclosed in the Ehlers U.S. Patent No.
4,626,848 and one example of a pre-programmed remote control is
disclosed in the Rumbolt et al U.S. Patent No. 4,841,368.A disadvantage of the learning remote control is that the
user must possess a working teaching remote control in order to
program it, the teaching process is often cumbersome and
confusing to the user, and there exist so many different IR
modulation schemes that it is difficult to create a handheld
device capable of "learning" them all.A disadvantage of the pre-programmed remote control is
that manufacturers are continuously devising new coding schemes
and adding new functions to existing coding schemes. Pre-programmed
universal remote controls whose information is
permanently stored in ROM can thus become obsolete. Also,
because the amount of memory available in any practical product 
is finite, a typical pre-programmed remote control will contain only a subset of the codes currently
in use at the time of its manufacture.One solution to the inability to add codes to a ROM-based pre-programmed remote control
is to provide a writable non-channel, such as a serial port, via which new codes can be
"downloaded" to the remote control. Just such a remote control is disclosed in the Darbee, et al.
U.S. Patent No. 4,959,810. However, such an "upgradeable" remote control requires attachment
to a
