<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of paste-form, water-free or
substantially water-free detergents containing nonionic and anionic

surfactants, soap, builders and bleaching agents, characterized in that
sodium salts of linear fatty acids containing 12 to 22 carbon atoms are

incorporated in the mixture of nonionic and anionic surfactants heated to 70
to 90°C in particle form with a particle size of at most 0.4 mm without the

addition of water in quantities of 0.5 to 10% by weight, based on the final
detergent, and the remaining constituents of the detergent are incorporated

after cooling of this mixture to below 30°C.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that at least two
different nonionic surfactants, preferably fatty alcohol ethoxylates containing

12 to 18 carbon atoms in the fatty alcohol component with different
degrees of ethoxylation of 2 to 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of fatty

alcohol in quantities of 3 to 60% by weight, based on the final detergent,
are used in the mixture of nonionic and anionic surfactants.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
polycarboxylates and/or phosphonates and/or carbonates and/or silicates

are used as builders in quantities of 10 to 50% by weight, based on the
final detergent.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
sodium perborate and/or sodium percarbonate are used as the bleach, if

desired in combination with activators such as, for example, tetraacetyl
ethylenediamine or diperoxydodecane dioic anhydride in quantities of 10 to

30% by weight, based on the final detergent.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
other detergent ingredients such as, for example, enzymes, foam inhibitors,

optical brighteners, soil suspending agents, fragrances and dyes are
additionally incorporated in small quantities.
