<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel aromatic polycarbodiimide. The
aromatic polycarbodiimide of the present invention provides films, adhesives, and
moldings having various excellent characteristics such as a high heat resistance, etc.Conventional aromatic polycarbodiimides are obtained by using
diphenylmethane diisocynate (MDI), tolylene diisocyanate (TDI), etc., as a monomer,
and polymerizing this. Such a polycarbodiimide is used as a flameproofing film and
a heat resistant adhesive due to its excellent heat resistance.However, such a conventional polycarbodiimide film is poor in the
solubility, is gelled and deposited as solids with increasing its molecular weight,
whereby a sufficiently high molecular weight polymer is not obtained. Further, the
polycarbodiimide film has a heat resistance in the point that even when the film is
exposed to high temperature of 400°C or more, a volatile gas and decomposed
monomers are not formed, but when the film is heat-treated at a temperature of
200°C or higher, the film loses the self-supporting property and becomes brittle,
whereby the film cannot endure the practical use. Furthermore, when the film is
heat-adhered to an adherend such as a copper foil, etc., it cannot say that the
adhesive force is sufficient.Fig. 1 is a graph showing an infrared absorption spectrum of the polymer
obtained in Example 1; andFig. 2 is a graph showing an infrared absorption spectrum of the polymer 
obtained in Example 3.As a result of making various investigations for solving these problems of
such a conventional polycarbodiimide, the present inventors have succeeded to
obtain the novel aromatic polycarbodiimide of the present invention.That is, the present invention provides an aromatic polycarbodiimide
having a structural repeating unit represented by the following formula (I):

wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group (having 1 to 5 carbon atoms,
and preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms) and n is an integer of 3 to 600.In the formula (I), R represents particularly preferably a hydrogen atom or
a methyl group and the bonding position thereof is m- or p-position of a hexafluoro-iso-propyfidene
group.Also, the present invention provides an organic solvent solution thereof
and a film thereof. In the present specification, the term "film" means a film-formed
form of the polymer and includes a so-called sheet. The polymer of the present
invention is a novel high molecular weight compound, has a very high heat resistance
together with an excellent solubility, and also is
