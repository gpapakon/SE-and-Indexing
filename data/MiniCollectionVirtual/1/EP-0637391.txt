<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photothermographic materials and in 
particular it relates to dry silver systems capable of producing color images. Imaging systems capable of producing multiple colors often rely upon 
barrier interlayers to separate adjacent imaging chemistries. In some cases, 
such as those in which a dye image is formed and diffused to a receiving 
layer, the interlayer must not only separate imaging chemistries, but be 
permeable to dyes as well. Dry silver based imageable articles are one type 
of imaging system which may employ interlayers in this manner. Dry silver compositions or emulsions are photothermographic 
compositions and contain a light-insensitive, reducible silver source; a light-sensitive 
silver source; and a reducing agent for the light-insensitive, 
reducible silver source. The light-sensitive material is generally 
photographic silver halide, which must be in catalytic proximity to the light-insensitive, 
reducible silver source. Catalytic proximity requires an intimate 
physical association of these two materials so that when silver specks or 
nuclei are generated by the irradiation or light exposure of the photographic 
silver halide, those nuclei are able to catalyze the reduction of the reducible 
silver source by the reducing agent. It has been long understood that silver 
halide is a catalyst for the reduction of silver ions and the silver-generating, 
light-sensitive silver halide catalyst progenitor may be placed into catalytic 
proximity with the light-insensitive, reducible silver source in a number of 
different fashions, such as by partial metathesis of the light-insensitive 
reducible silver source with a halogen-containing source; co-precipitation of 
silver halide and the light-insensitive, reducible silver source material; and  
 
other methods that intimately associate the silver halide and the light-insensitive, 
reducible silver source. In both photographic and photothermographic emulsions, exposure 
of the photographic silver halide to light produces small clusters of silver 
atoms. The image-wise distribution of these clusters is known in the art as 
a latent image. Since this latent image generally is not visible by ordinary 
means, the light-sensitive article must be further processed in order to 
produce a visual image. The visual image is produced by the catalytic 
reduction of silver ions which are in catalytic proximity to the silver halide 
grains bearing the latent image. In color dry silver imaging systems, a leuco dye is typically
