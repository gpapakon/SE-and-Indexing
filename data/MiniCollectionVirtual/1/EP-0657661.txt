<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an actuating device for a disc brake, especially a floating-calliper disc brake, with at least one brake shaft (5), at least one pivoted lever (6) engaging on the brake shaft, and at least one actuating element (13), which engages on the pivoted lever and serves to pivot the said lever. The brake shaft has a contour (10) such that the clearance between a support remote from the brake disc and a brake shoe acting on the brake disc changes as the pivoted lever is pivoted. The position of the point of engagement (LA,LX) of the actuating element along the pivoted lever can be changed.

<CLAIMS>
Clamping unit for a floating caliper disc brake, with one floating caliper (1), a
minimum of one brake shaft (5), a minimum of one rotating lever (6) engaging the

brake shaft (5) and a minimum of one actuating element (14) to rotate the brake
lever (6), whereby the brake shaft (5) utilises a contoured groove on which the air

gap with, between the abutment (9) on the opposite side of the brake disc and the
brake pad (2), changes upon rotation of the brake lever (6), whereby


the position of the engagement point (LA, LX) for the actuating element (14) of the
brake lever (6) is variable and
a control mechanism (13) for the actuating element (14), mounted to the caliper (1)
on a flanged surface transverse to the actuation direction of the actuating element

(14), the position of which is variable on the flanged surface according to the
position (LA, LX) of the engagement point.
Clamping unit according to claim 1, characterised by an opening (15) in the
caliper (1), whereby the flange is positioned on the opening (15) and the actuating

element (14) protrudes through the opening (15).
Clamping unit according to claim 1, characterised by an opening (15') in the
caliper (1), whereby the brake lever (6) protrudes through the opening (15').
Clamping unit according to claims 1 or 2, characterised by a sealing element (17)
on the opening (15, 15').
Clamping unit according to one of the aforementioned claims, characterised by
all adjustable engagement points (LA, LX) being positioned on a straight plane.
