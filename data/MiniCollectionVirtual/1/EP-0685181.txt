<ABSTRACT>
The packaging comprises a box with a cover and a container (3) with a bottom (3a) containing the powder. A sieve (9) is located on the powder (8) which is placed on a shock absorber and/or aerator (6) situated on the container bottom. Between the absorber and aerator and the powder is placed a non-return filter (7) which may or may not be fixed to the absorber. The absorber consists of a piece of foam with open or semi-open cells, or bellows. The foam consists of between 30 and 50 percent open cells.

<CLAIMS>
Packaging and dispensing assembly, of a type
for the indirect application, by means of a sampling

member (5), of a product in loose-powder form,
comprising a case (1) with a lid (2) and a receptacle

(3) containing the product and including a base (3a),
the said powder itself being placed on an elastically

deformable damper and/or aerator means (6,6a) in
con
tact with the base (3a) of the receptacle and
capable of deforming through the action of the powder

being sampled, characterized in that it also comprises
a screen (9) capable of deforming at the time of the

action of sampling the powder (8) and arranged over the
latter, the powder being sampled by the sampling member

(5) being pressed onto the powder through the screen
(9).
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the elastically deformable damper and/or aerator

means (6,6a) has protuberances or undulations (6b).
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the base (3a) has protuberances

or undulations (3b).
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that, between the elastically

deformable damper and/or aerator means (6,6a) and the
powder there is a flexible non-return filter (7) which

may or may not be integral with the deformable damper
means. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the elastically deformable damper

and/or aerator means (6,6a) consists of a means chosen
from a pad made from open- or semi-open-cell foam (6)

and a bellows (6a).
Assembly according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the open-cell foam is chosen from polyether foams,

polyurethane foams, latex foams and elastomer foams.
Assembly according to one of Claims 5 and 6,
characterized in that the foam has from 30% to 50% of

open cells.
Assembly according to one of Claims 4 to 7,
characterized in that the non-return filter (7)

consists of an element chosen from an assembly of woven
or nonwoven fibres, a screen, a foam and a metal grid.
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the powder (8) has a particle

size ranging from 1 micron to 100 microns.
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the powder (8) has a particle

size ranging from 6 microns to 20 microns.
Assembly according to one of Claims 5 to 10,
characterized in that the cells of the foam have an

opening ranging from 0.005 mm to 2 mm.
Assembly according to Claims 5 to 11,
characterized in that the cells of the foam have an

opening ranging from 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm.
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterized in that the screen (9) arranged on the

powder (8) has mesh sizes ranging from 5 microns to
600 microns.
Assembly according to Claims 1 to 13,
characterized in that the screen (9) arranged on the

powder (8) has mesh sizes ranging from 30 microns to
200 microns.
Make-up compact, characterized in that it
consists of an assembly according to one of Claims 1 to

14.
