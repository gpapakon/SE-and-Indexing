<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
measuring an angle in a piece, particularly an angle formed
in a piece of sheet metal by bending, during the operation
to bend the piece in a bending press having a punch and a
V-shaped die which cooperate with each other.Devices for measuring an angle formed in a piece by
bending directly during the bending operation in a bending
press have already been proposed.One of these known devices (see also EP-A-0 352 097), which is shown in Figure
1, provides for the use of two or more distance-measuring
sensors 100 disposed on each face 102 of the V-shaped
groove in the die 104. This known device calculates the
angle formed in the piece by bending, by means of direct
distance measurements between the surface of the piece and
the respective wall 102 of the V-shaped groove in the die
104, made with pointed feelers 100 at two points spaced a
known distance apart in a direction perpendicular to the
bending line. The main disadvantage found with this
solution results from the need to miniaturize the device if
it is to be used in "real time", that is, immediately after
the bend has been made with the sheet metal still in the
die, Just after the punch has been raised to leave the
sheet metal free. In fact, in order to obtain an accurate
measurement of the bend angle, it is necessary to measure
the distance between the piece and the wall of the V-shaped
groove with an accuracy of the order of one micron, 
particularly when the V-shaped groove itself is small.
Although the sensors can make measurements with this
accuracy, the measurement effected is corrupted decisively
by the surface roughness of the piece which is of the same
order of magnitude as the precision with which the
measurement has to be made.The object of the present invention is to provide a
device for measuring an angle in a piece, which is not
affected by the aforementioned disadvantages and which
provides very precise and reproducible measurements
regardless of the condition of the surface of the piece.According to the invention, this object is achieved by
the provision of a device having the characteristics
forming the subject of Claim 1. Further characteristics and advantages of the present
invention will become clear in the course of the detailed
description which follows, given purely by way of nonlimiting
example, with reference to the appended drawings,
in which:

device,Figure 2 is a diagram showing the concept of the
