<ABSTRACT>
The present invention changes a color corresponding to a source color to a 
destination color by initially selecting a target source color and a target destination color. 

The selected target source color is converted to a source hue value, a source chroma 
reference value, and a source lightness reference value, and the selected target 

destination color is converted to a destination hue value, a destination chroma reference 
value, and a destination lightness reference value. A circuit then generates a first set of 

source/destination chroma and a first set of source/destination lightness values 
representing source/destination chroma and lightness relationships, respectively, for 

sources values in a range from the source chroma and lightness reference values, 
respectively, to minimum source chroma and lightness values, respectively, using a first and 

third function, respectively. The circuit also generates a second set of source/destination 
chroma values and a second set of source/destination lightness values representing 

source/destination chroma and lightness relationships, respectively, for source values in a 
range from the source chroma and lightness reference values, respectively, to maximum 

source chroma and lightness values, respectively, using a second and fourth function, 
respectively. These values are stored. Received color data is converted to a color hue 

value, a color chroma value, and a color lightness value. A comparator determines if the 
color hue value corresponds to the source hue value. When the comparator determines 

that the color hue value corresponds to the source hue value, destination chroma and 
lightness values associated with the source chroma and lightness values, respectively, that 

corresponds to the color chroma and lightness values, respectively, are selected based on 
the stored source/destination chroma and lightness relationships, respectively. The 

destination hue value and the selected destination chroma and lightness values are 
converted into output color data representing the destination color.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for converting
images of one color to images of another color. More particularly, the present invention is
directed to an apparatus and method for color conversion wherein the target color is
converted to a designated color while maintaining its gradation characteristics and a high
quality.Conventional copiers, digital copiers in particular, offer various features for
image editing in reproducing a document, including color conversion: this enables a user
to designate a color in the document and convert this designated color to another color.
With the color conversion function, the user selects a source color and a destination color
such that the reproduced document will have all areas corresponding to the source color
changed to the destination color. In a conventional digital copier, there may be a choice of
retaining the source area gradation or not. The gradation mode is appropriate for
pictorial images, while gradation can be excluded when constant colors are used; i.e., in
business graphics.Color conversion involves the detection of pixels whose color is close to that
of the selected source color and subsequent changing of the source color to the user
selected destination color. The color video data from a scanner is usually in the form of
red, green and blue (RGB) intensity. In order to identify pixels belonging to a particular
color, it is possible to check the RGB values directly. However, simply checking the RGB
values to identify pixels of a certain color and perform changes therefrom is not always
satisfactory.Conventionally, color conversion operations have preferred to identify the
particular color by studying the hue, chroma, and lightness of the color after converting
the RGB values to a hue, chroma, and lightness space. Color spaces of this nature include
the Munsell color specification, HSV, HLS (a space used in computer graphics), HSI (a color
spaced used in image processing), and L*C*h which is a polar coordinate formed of
L*a*b*.Hue is defined generically by the common term color. In other words, such
common terms as red, yellow, green, and blue refer to hue. It is generally represented as 
an angular coordinate in the hue/chroma/lightness color space. The vividness or dullness
of a color is defined as saturation or chroma. In other words, chroma or saturation
indicates how close a color is either to gray or to its pure hue. It is represented as a radial
coordinate in the hue/chroma/lightness color space. The chroma
