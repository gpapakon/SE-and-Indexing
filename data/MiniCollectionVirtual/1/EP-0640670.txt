<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film-forming
silicone emulsion composition which forms a film exhibiting
an excellent adhesion to a rubber, a plastic, a cloth,
etc., and having a good gloss, a good water repellency,
good release properties, and good slip properties.Heretofore, a silicone emulsion has been used as
a releasing agent, a polishing agent or a fiber treating
agent for domestic articles, bags, cloth, vinyl products
for ship or automobile, sports goods, etc. However, the
conventional silicone emulsion is disadvantageous in that
it has an insufficient durability, so that it must be reapplied.
As silicone emulsions having a sufficient
durability there have been known emulsions of aminofunctional
silicone (see JP-A-60-127382 (The term "JP-A" as
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application"), JP-A-62-116633, JP-A-63-66265). However,
the application of these emulsions is all limited to cloth
material having a good adhesiveness and permeability or
material requiring little adhesiveness. Accordingly,
silicone emulsions having a good durability and a good
adhesion to materials such as rubber and plastic as well
have been desired. It has been known to use a mixture of aminosiloxane
and epoxysiloxane (see JP-B-48-17514 (The term
"JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent
publication")) or a reaction product of aminosiloxane with
epoxysilane (JP-B-1-22390) as a fiber treating agent.
However, further improvements in the adhesion and
durability of such a fiber treating agent have been
desired.Further, it has been known to use a reaction
product or mixture of epoxysiloxane and aminosilane as a
surface treating agent for rubber, plastic, etc. (see JP-A-52-123394,
JP-A-54-43891, JP-A-54-90375, JP-A-56-78960, JP-A-61-159427,
JP-A-2-233763). However, the compositions
disclosed in these references are normally in the form of
solution in an organic solvent and are not embodied in the
form of emulsion. If a composition made of such a solution
in an organic solvent is used, it causes environmental
hygiene or safety problems such as ignition as well as
denaturation of a substrate such as a rubber and a plastic.
Moreover, it is difficult to obtain an emulsion composition
having good properties by merely replacing such a composition
by an emulsion.Accordingly, an object of the present invention
is to provide a film-forming silicone emulsion composition
which forms a film exhibiting a good adhesion to various 
materials, and having a good water repellency, good release
propertie
