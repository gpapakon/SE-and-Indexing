<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a composite element comprising at least one wooden layer which is bound to a concrete or mortar layer, as well as to a composite element manufactured accordingly. In order to provide this composite element with a high load carrying capacity, which is the result of the concrete or mortar layer adhering onto the whole surface of the wooden layer, an adhesive (16) with a paste consistency is applied so that the adhesive coats the surface and forms an adhesive layer. Then, fresh hydraulic concrete or fresh hydraulic mortar is spread onto the adhesive layer (16) and is distributed over this layer in order to coat the surface and form the concrete or mortar layer (14). The adhesive layer (16) and the concrete or mortar layer (14) are caused to set during a common transient setting phase to produce an inter-layer binding over a large surface.
