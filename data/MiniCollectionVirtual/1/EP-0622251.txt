<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a non-pneumatic tyre which essentially consists of rubber or of rubber-like plastics and has a tread, a base layer (3) and a base layer reinforcement (4) made of textile or metallic reinforcement carriers. In order to permit automated production of the base layer reinforcement, it is proposed that the base layer reinforcement should consist of an at least single-layer coil tread which is produced by wrapping a single cord or wire or cable or a strip of material in numerous windings, the said coil tread extending at least over 20% of the axial width of the base layer.

Solid tyre, which is substantially formed from 
rubber or rubber-like plastics materials, having a tread 

strip (2), a bottom layer (3) and a bottom layer 
reinforcement formed from textile or metallic reinforcing 

members, the bottom layer reinforcement comprising a wound 
bandage (4) which is at least single-layered, said bandage 

being produced by winding a single filament or wire or 
respectively rope in numerous windings, and said bandage 

extending over at least 20 % of the axial width of the 
bottom layer (3), characterised in that the pitch of the 

windings of the wound bandage (4) is variable. 
Solid tyre, which is substantially formed from 
rubber or rubber-like plastics materials, having a tread 

strip (2'), a bottom layer (3') and a bottom layer 
reinforcement formed from textile or metallic reinforcing 

members, the bottom layer reinforcement comprising a wound 
bandage (4') which is at least single-layered, said 

bandage being produced by winding a strip of material (5'), 
formed from a plurality of filaments or wires or 

respectively ropes disposed in a cord ply, in a plurality 
of windings, and said bandage extending over at least 20 % 

of the axial width of the bottom layer (3'), characterised 
in that the pitch of the windings of the wound bandage (4') 

is variable. 
Solid tyre according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the wound bandage (4,4') is formed from a natural 

fibre or a chemical fibre. 
Solid tyre according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the single filament or wire has a diameter of less 

than 2 mm.  
 
Solid tyre according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that each ply of the wound bandage (4,4') extends 

parallel to the bottom surface (3,3') of the tyre. 
Solid tyre according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the filaments or respectively wires of the strip of 

material (5') are covered with a rubber coating layer. 
Solid tyre according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the radially inner ply of the wound bandage (4,4') 

has a spacing of between 0 and 25 mm from the bottom 
surface of the tyre. 
Solid tyre according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the wound bandage (4,4') has a multiple-layered 

construction, and in that the filament or respectively wire 
is wound more tightly in the axial direction in individual 

zones, so that bundles of filaments or respectively wires 
(7,7') are formed. 
Solid tyre according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the bottom surface has a double-conical configuration, 

and in that the wound bandage (4,4') extends towards the 
centre in a radially inwardly curved manner. 
Solid tyre according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the filaments or respectively wires of the strip of 

material (5') are covered with a rubber coating layer. 
Solid tyre according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the wound bandage (4') has a single-layered 

configuration with windings which are disposed close 
together or at a slight spacing from one another. 
Solid tyre according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the strip of material (5') is overlappingly disposed 

in the individual windings of the wound bandage (4').  
 
Solid tyre according to claim 2, characterised in 

that the wound bandage (4') is wound so that the windings 
overlap in the axially outer regions of the solid tyre and 

are close up to one another in the central region or with a 
spacing from one another. 
Method of producing a solid tyre according to claim 
1 or 2, characterised in that, if necessary, a portion of a 

bottom layer (3,3') of the solid tyre is initially placed 
upon a winding drum, in that a single- or multiple-layered 

wound bandage (4,4') is then produced by winding a single 
filament or wire or rope or respectively a strip of 

material (5') in adjacent windings with a variable pitch, 
in that subsequently the bottom layer (3,3') is completed 

and the remaining portions of the blank are applied.
