<ABSTRACT>
A packet (1) for cigarettes or for tobacco industry products, is efficiently protected from light and from the exit or penetration of moisture and loss of aroma or taste of the products which it contains, even if it is wrapped with a label (3;10) generally comprising only one layer of material, when special precautions are taken in order to form the corners of the packet. Another advantage of the proposed package is that it has several opening means (20, 21, 22), selectable by the user, allowing the latter to open his packet either like a soft packet or like a hard packet. A package of this type is particularly ecological since it is preferably made from a biodegradable material.

Package for a group (1) of products of the tobacco 
industry, especially for a group of cigarettes in order to 

form a soft-type pack generally speaking formed from a 
single label or packaging blank (3, 10) comprising a 

plurality of panels, forming the frontal (30A, 30B), side 
(30C, 30D), top-end (11; 30E), and bottom-end (12; 30F) 

faces of said pack, as well as the gluing panels (31, 31A, 
31B, 31C), and comprising a first opening means made up of 

a tongue (21; 22) for pulling away a pre-cut portion (11A; 
12A) of the panels (30E, 31A; 30F, 31) forming a first of 

one of said end faces of the pack,
 
   characterized in that
 
   it further comprises at least another opening means 

made up either
 
   of a tongue (22; 21) for pulling away a pre-cut 

portion (12A, 11A) of the panels (30F, 31; 30E, 31A) 
forming the end face opposite to said first end face
 
   either/and
 
   of a tongue (20) for pulling away a thickness-pre-reduced 

portion of the panels forming the front (30A, 30B) 
and side (30C, 30D, 31C) faces of the pack. 
Package according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said thickness-pre-reduced portion of the panels forming 

the frontal (30A, 30B) and side (30C, 30D, 31C) faces of 
the pack is pre-cut (36). 
Package according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one of the corners of said 

package is made up of a diamond-shaped folding (33A, 33B, 
33C). 
Label or packaging blank (3) for making a package 
according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that it includes at least one cut (34A, 34B) defining a 
projection incorporated in the body of the label, in order  

 
to form a tongue (21, 22) for pulling away a portion (11A, 

12A) of the panels (30E, 30F, 31, 31A, 31B) forming the top 
(11) or bottom (12) face of the pack. 
Label or packaging blank according to claim 4, 
characterized in that it includes a cut of a side edge of a 

side panel (30C) defining a projection in order to form a 
tongue (20) for pulling away a portion (13, 20A) of the 

panels forming the frontal (30A, 30B) and side (30C, 30D, 
31C) faces of the pack. 
Label or packaging blank according to one of the 
claims 4 or 5, characterized in that it includes opening 

lines (34C, 34E, 35A, 35B, 35C, 36) for each of said 
projections, said opening lines surrounding the portions of 

the panels to be pulled away. 
Label or packaging blank according to claim 6, 
characterized in that at least one opening line consists of 

a perforated line. 
Label or packaging blank according to claim 7, 
characterized in that at least one of said perforated 

opening lines is covered, on at least one layer of the 
package, with a fluid-tightness coating (A). 
Label or packaging blank according to one of the 
claims 4 or 5, characterized in that the majority of the 

fibers of the material constituting it are oriented in a 
direction parallel to the pulling-away direction (B) of 

said tongues (20, 21, 22). 
Label or packaging blank according to claim 6, 
characterized in that at least one opening line (34C, 34E, 

35A, 35B, 35C, 36) consists of a reduction of the thickness 
of said label. 
Label or packaging blank according to claim 10, 
characterized in that the reduction of thickness of the 

label is obtained by a knurling operation. 
Label or packaging blank according to one of the 
claims 6 to 11, characterized in that an adhesive strip
