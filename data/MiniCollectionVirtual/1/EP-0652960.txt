<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel purified and isolated nucleotide sequences encoding the cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase designated cGB-PDE. Also provided by the invention are methods and materials for the recombinant production of cGB-PDE polypeptide products and methods for identifying compounds which modulate the enzymatic activity of cGB-PDE polypeptides.

<DESCRIPTION>
Experimental work described herein was supported in part by Research
Grants GM15731, DK21723, DK40029 and GM41269 and the Medical Scientist
Training Program Grant GM07347 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The
United States government has certain rights in the invention.The present invention relates generally to a cyclic guanosine
monophosphate-binding, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase
designated cGB-PDE and more particularly to novel purified and isolated
polynucleotides encoding cGB-PDE polypeptides, to methods and materials for
recombinant production of cGB-PDE polypeptides, and to methods for identifying
modulators of cGB-PDE activity.Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that catalyze the
hydrolysis of 3'5' cyclic nucleotides such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to the corresponding nucleoside 5'
monophosphates constitute a complex family of enzymes. By mediating the
intracellular concentration of the cyclic nucleotides, the PDE isoenzymes function in
signal transduction pathways involving cyclic nucleotide second messengers.A variety of PDEs have been isolated from different tissue sources and
many of the PDEs characterized to date exhibit differences in biological properties
including physicochemical properties, substrate specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors,
immunological reactivity and mode of regulation. [See Beavo et al., Cyclic
Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases: Structure, Regulation and Drug Action, John Wiley
& Sons, Chichester, U.K. (1990)] Comparison of the known amino acid sequences
of various PDEs indicates that most PDEs are chimeric multidomain proteins that 
have distinct catalytic and regulatory domains. [See Charbonneau, pp. 267-296 in
Beavo et al., supra] All mammalian PDEs characterized to date share a sequence of
approximately 250 amino acid residues in length that appears to comprise the catalytic
site and is located in the carboxyl terminal region of the enzyme. PDE domains that
interact with allosteric or regulatory molecules are thought to be located within the
amino-terminal regions of the isoenzymes. Based on their biological properties, the
PDEs may be classified into six general families: the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulated
PDEs (Type I), the cGMP-stimulated PDEs (Type II), the cGMP-inhibited PDEs
(Type III), the cAMP-specfic PDEs (Type IV), the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase
cGB-PDE (Type V) which is the subject of the present invention and the cGMP-specific
photoreceptor PDEs (Type
