<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, methods are provided with which the charges acting on the surface of a printing forme (30) having a ferroelectric layer can be increased. For this purpose, either the temperature on the surface of the printing forme (30) is increased with respect to the temperature at which it was polarised or, for the transfer of toner, a mechanical loading is exerted on the forme cylinder (3), or charge carriers are applied over the entire surface onto the printing forme (30), as a result of which a potential difference is produced between positively and negatively polarised regions, which leads to an increase of contrast between image regions and non-image regions.

Process for reproducing an image original by means 
of a printing forme (30) which has a layer of a ferro-electric 

material, in which the layer is polarised at a 
first temperature (T
1
) according to an image to be 
printed, and in which electrically charged particles 

are deposited on the surface of the ferro-electric 
material, characterised in that after it has been 

polarised the printing forme (30) is additionally 
charged with electrical charges from a charge carrier 

source for the image-wise increase in the number of 
surface charges on the layer. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
at least one positive (11) or one negative electrode 

(12) is arranged near the layer so as to transfer 
charges onto its surface. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the charge is transmitted from an electrically non-conductive 

dielectric layer. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
charges are applied to the layer by corona-discharge or 

by an electrode (11, 12) contacting the surface of the 
layer. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that to compensate for charge carrier 

densities of different strengths in free surface 
charges in the image and non-image areas, the image and 

non-image areas are oppositely charged and then charged 
again with the electrical charges provided.  

 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the charge is generated on the dielectric layer by 

friction, contact with the electrodes (11, 12) or 
corona-charging. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that after it has been polarised the 

printing forme (30) is heated to a second, higher 
temperature (T
2
) below the Curie temperature, and in 
that the particles are deposited on the surface of the 

layer at this temperature and then transferred to a 
material (2) to be printed. 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the printing forme (30) together with the layer is 

tempered at the second temperature (T
2
). 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that 
after deposition of the particles on the layer surface 

the layer is cooled to a third temperature (T
3
) which 
is lower than the second temperature (T
2
) at which the 
particles were deposited on the layer, and in that the 

layer is heated again to the second temperature (T
2
) to 
receive the particles again. 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the charged particles are contained in a liquid, 

in that after deposition of the particles the layer is 
cooled, by evaporation of the liquid drawn by its 

surface, to a temperature (T
3
) which is lower than the 
second temperature (T
2
) at which the particles were 
deposited, and in that the layer is heated again to the 

second temperature (T
2
) to receive the particles again. 
Process according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the layer is heated by immersion into a toner bath  

 
tempered at the second temperature (T
2
). 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
charcterised in that for the image-wise increase in the 

number of surface charges on the layer, a mechanical 
force is exerted on the surface of the layer during 

deposition of the particles. 
Process according to claim 12, characterised in 
that the printing forme (30) is applied to the casing 

surface of a forme cylinder (3), in that the toner is 
applied to the forme cylinder (3) by means of a feeding 

device, in particular by means of a toner application 
roller (4), and in that the toner application roller 

(4) is pressed against the forme cylinder (3) and hence 
against the layer. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that a toner application and/or toner 

removal electrode (13, 14) for increasing toner 
application in the image areas and reducing toner 

application in the non-image areas are arranged near 
the surface of the layer and according to its charge 

remove the toner from the surface of the printing forme 
(30) or press it firmly on the surface. 
Process for the imaging of a printing forme (30) 
which has a layer of a ferro-electric material, 

characterised in that the entire surface of the 
printing forme is polarised by a first electrode (11) 

in a first polarisation direction (ΔP, E
3
) and is 
additionally electrically charged, and in that the 

image areas are then polarised by a second electrode 
(12) in the opposite polarisation direction and 

additionally electrically (ΔP, E

) charged in the same 
direction.
