<DESCRIPTION>
TETRACYCLIC COMPOUNDS PROCESS AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR USE AS ANTITUMOUR AGENTSThe present invention relates to heterocyclic compounds which have been found to have anti-tumour activity. More specifically, the invention concerns Pyrrolo [3,2-b] carbazoles, IH-Benzofuro [3,2-f.] indoles and 1H-[1] Benzothieno [2,3-f indoles, methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical formulations containing them and their use as anti-tumour agents.Research in the area of cancer chemotherapy has produced a variety of anti-tumour agents, which have differing degrees of efficacy. Standard clinically used agents include adriamycin, actinomycin D, methotrex- ate, 5-fluorouracil, ciβ-platinum, vincristine and vinblastine. How¬ ever, these presently available anti-tumour agents are known to have various disadvantages, such as toxicity to healthy cells and resistance to certain tumour types.There thus exists a continuing need to develop new and improved anti-tumour agents.Khoshtariya et al, him. Geterotsikl. Soedin (1980), (2) 203-8, disclose the synthesis of certain indolobenzo[b] thiopheneβ.Khoshtariya et al, khim Geterotsikl Soedin (1984), (10) 1366-70 disclose the synthesis of certain indolobenzo[b] furans.Kakhabrishvili et al, khim Geterotsikl Soedin (1985), (3) 355-8 disclose the synthesis of certain derivatives of indolo[5,6-d] and indolo [5,4-d] benzo[b] furansThe patent specification EP447,703 discloses the synthesis of certain benzo(5,6-b)benzofuran-2-carboxylates.There have now been discovered novel compounds which exhibit anti-tumour cell activity with low toxicity against normal cell lines. 

Thus, in a first aspect the present invention provides a compound of the general formula (1)
 and salts and physiologically functional derivatives thereof,wherein A is7 7X is O, S, SO, SO , CH , CO or NR , wherein R is H, alkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkenyl, acyl, alkynyl, sulphonyl or substituted sulphonyl;Y is O, S, SO, SO , CH , CO or NR ;
 aryl, substituted aryl or aralkyl, R is acyl or substituted acyl, R10 and R11 are independently hydrogen, alkyl or aryl, and n is 1 to 4 carbon atoms;2 8 12R is H, COOR , alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl or CH CH CO R12 2 2 2 wherein R is alkyl or aryl;3 4 R and R are independently H,hydroxy, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, halo, cyano, nitro, amino, alkyl amino, dialkyl amino,12 substituted alkyl, carboxyl or CO R ;
