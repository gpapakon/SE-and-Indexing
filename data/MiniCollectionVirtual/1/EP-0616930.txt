<ABSTRACT>
In an air brake system (10) of a commercial motor vehicle it is proposed by simple means to reduce the brake pressure on the wheel brake (16) when a sensor (59) detects excessive wear on the brake lining (60). In a working line (14) running between a brake valve (13) and a brake cylinder (15) a pressure control valve (19) is arranged with an inlet valve (23) and an outlet valve (35) and a pressure-reducing valve device (43). When braking, the inlet valve (23), in the presence of a wear-dependent signal, is switched by actuation of a reversing valve (27) into the closed position, so that brake pressure can build up in the brake cylinder (15) only by way of the pressure-reducing valve device (43).
