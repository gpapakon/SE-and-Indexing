<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improved process for improving the adhesion between a sintered material substrate and a diamond layer deposited thereon by removal of the sintered material-bonding phase from the substrate surface before the diamond coating. For this purpose, the process according to the invention uses a device such as is usually employed in a different design for the CVD application of diamond layers. In this case, the process parameters are modified as compared with those of conventional diamond coating in such a way that binder metal is evaporated out of a very narrow edge zone of the substrate surface, namely by utilising the heat of reaction from the recombination of previously dissociated hydrogen gas directly at the substrate surface.

Process for improving adhesion between a hard alloy
substrate composed of hard material and binding metal

for indexable inserts and a diamond coating applied
thereto by means of hot filament chemical vapour

deposition (HF-CVD) process and deposited from the gas
phase, by a removal prior to coating application of

binding metal by means of heat treatment, wherein
restructuring and roughening of the hard alloy surface

takes place, characterised

in that for removal of the binding metal,
apparatuses are used such as are suitable for the

HF-CVD process due to the availability of carbon-containing
gases and hydrogen dissociating at the

hot filament,
in that, unlike the conditions for the depositing
of a diamond coating for the removal of binding

metal, the ratio of H
2
 gas to hydrocarbon gas in
the reaction chamber of the apparatus changes to

a value of 10
2
 - 10
3
 and simultaneously the glow
temperature T of the hot filament element is

brought to a value of 
>
2100°C,
in that at the substrate surface, via the
presence of dissociated hydrogen, conditions are

created in which, via a strongly exothermic
reaction, dissociated hydrogen is recombined to H
2

and vaporisation by heat of binding metal from a
peripheral zone of the substrate close to the

surface is effected,
in that the substrate interior is set to
temperatures below an upper limit, from which in

the interior a material change arises which
affects the use according to stipulation of the

diamond-coated substrate.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
unlike the conditions for the depositing of a diamond

coating, for the binding metal vaporisation the
substrate surface to be coated is brought to a smaller

distance D from the plane of the hot filament
elements.
Process according to claim 1 to 2, characterised in
that the gas in the reaction chamber is supplied at an

overall pressure p of 0.1 - 25 kPa.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the process gas is supplied at

an overall pressure p of 0.1 - 25 kPa.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the removal of the binding metal

is effected within a process duration t of 0.5 to 6 h.
Process according to claim 1 to 5, characterised in
that for the removal of the binding metal the

following process parameters are applied: T = 2250 -
2300°C, D = 2.5 - 3 mm, p = 1.3 - 2.0 kPa,

t = 2.5 - 3 h.
Process according to claim 1 to 6, characterised in
that the substrates are disposed on either side of hot

filament elements disposed in a vertical plane.
Process according to claim 1 to 7, characterised in
that the binding metal is vaporised in the form of

metastable hydrides.
Process according to claim 1 to 8, characterised in
that WC-Co hard alloy is used as a substrate.
