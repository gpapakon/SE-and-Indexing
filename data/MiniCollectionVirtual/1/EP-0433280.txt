<ABSTRACT>
Containers (11, 12) for printing devices, be they ink reservoirs, ribbon cassettes or toner reservoirs, are fitted with an electronic storage device (14) in the form of a chip in which the information on the current level of the container and/or other status data relevant to printer operation, e.g. expiry date of printing medium, are stored. The level of the printing medium is detected via the central control system (16) of the printing device and transmitted to the chip (14). The chip on the container monitors consumption until the level of the printing medium (ink, ribbon, toner) has fallen to the point at which the container needs to be changed. It is impossible to reprogram the chip and thus to refill the container.

An arrangement for printers comprising 

a) a supply container (11, 12) for the accommodation of a 
printing medium, where the supply container (11, 12) is 

provided with an electronic storage device (14) in which 
items of status data relating to the printing medium and 

relevant to the printing operation are stored, 
b) means (16) for detecting a current filling level of the 
supply container (11, 12) and for recording a storage value, 

corresponding to the current filling level, in the 
electronic storage device (14), 
c) means (TI-ASIC, 21) for detecting the storage value, 
corresponding to a minimum supply of the printing medium, of 

the electronic storage device (14) and for triggering a 
warning signal (21) and/or blocking the printing operation 

and 
d) means (14, 17) for suppressing the programmability of the 
electronic storage device (14) when the storage value which 

corresponds to a minimum supply of the printing medium has 
been reached. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
information relating to the life of the printing medium is stored by 

way of status data. 
An arrangement as claimed in one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the storage device (14) is designed as a 

programmable, non-volatile data store. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that 
the storage device (14) comprises a counter (17) which is designed in 

such manner that, commencing from a initial basic count corresponding 
to the full state of the supply container (11, 12), this count is 

changed irreversibly in accordance with the consumption of printing 
medium.  

 
An arrangement as claimed in one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the storage device (14) contains a timer (18) 

which can be preset in respect of its basic setting and the count of 
which, commencing from the basic setting, is changed irreversibly in 

accordance with the current life of the printing medium. 
An arrangement as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the storage device is provided with an energy 

supply which is independent of the rest of the printer. 
An arrangement as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the supply container (11, 12) has the form of 

an ink supply container for an ink-jet printer. 
An arrangement as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the supply container (11, 12) has the form of a 

toner supply container for a printer or copier. 
An arrangement as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the supply container (11, 12) has the form of a 

ribbon cartridge. 
An arrangement as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the storage device (14) comprises a ROM for the 

accommodation of a code which identifies the supply container and is 
detectable by the analysis arrangement.
