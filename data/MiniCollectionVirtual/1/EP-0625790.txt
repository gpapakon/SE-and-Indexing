<ABSTRACT>
A flow switch is described which ensures that the switching point is reliably preset even at low flow rates and nevertheless has only low pressure losses at high flow rates, the flow path through the housing being constructed in an angled manner for this purpose, and the piston being arranged displaceably, at least partially in a housing guide located outside the flow path, such that the flow can strike its end.
