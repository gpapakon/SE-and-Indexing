<ABSTRACT>
Process for upgrading a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock 
substantially boiling in the gasoline range, which process 

comprises: 

a) subjecting the feedstock to a separation treatment and 
recovering therefrom a first hydrocarbon feed stream comprising C₆ 

and smaller hydrocarbons and a second hydrocarbon feed stream 
comprising C₆ and greater hydrocarbons; 
b) dividing the second hydrocarbon feed stream in a first 
fraction and a second fraction; 
c) subjecting at least part of the first fraction to a reforming 
step to produce a reformate; 
d) subjecting at least part of the second fraction and at least 
part of the reformate to a separation treatment wherein normal 

paraffins and optionally mono-isoparaffins are separated from 
di-isoparaffins; and 
e) recovering therefrom a first hydrocarbon product stream 
comprising normal paraffins and optionally mono-isoparaffins and a 

second hydrocarbon product stream comprising di-isoparaffins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for upgrading a
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling in the gasoline
range to produce a gasoline blending pool having an enhanced
octane content and a reduced aromatics content.One of the main objects in nowaday's oil refining is to
produce gasolines fulfilling the increasing environmental demands
on product quality and having a high octane number.This means for gasoline that the octane specification has now
to be established without lead-containing additives, less
aromatics, in particular benzene, less olefins and lower gasoline
vapour pressure.Object of the present invention is to provide a process for
the preparation of gasolines fulfilling both the increasing
environmental demands on product quality and the high octane
requirement.It has now been found that gasolines can be produced having a
high octane number and a reduced aromatics content, in particular
benzene, when use is made of an upgrading process comprising a
specific sequence of process steps.Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for
producing a gasoline blending pool having an enhanced octane
content and a reduced aromatics content, which process comprises:
a) subjecting a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially
boiling in the gasoline range to a separation treatment and
recovering therefrom a first hydrocarbon feed stream comprising C6
and smaller hydrocarbons and a second hydrocarbon feed stream
comprising C6 and greater hydrocarbons;b) dividing the second hydrocarbon feed stream into a first
fraction and a second fraction;c) subjecting at least part of the first fraction to a reforming
step to produce a reformate;d) subjecting at least part of the second fraction and at least
part of the reformate to a separation treatment wherein normal
paraffins and optionally mono-isoparaffins are separated from di-isoparaffins; e) recovering therefrom a first hydrocarbon product stream
comprising normal paraffins and optionally mono-isoparaffins and a
second hydrocarbon product stream comprising di-isoparaffins; andf) passing the second hydrocarbon product stream from step e) to
a gasoline blending pool.In this way a direct octane enhancement of the resultant
gasoline blending pool is established whilst a substantial
reduction of aromatics content, in particular of the benzene
content, is realized. In refineries with restriction on production
of gasoline due to octane and/or capacity limitations, this octane
enhancement can permit increased gasoline production.The two
