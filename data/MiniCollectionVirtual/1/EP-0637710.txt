<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a self-closing valve for controlling water outlet, having a housing (1) which can be inserted into a fitting body (5), in which a main valve (2) and a control valve (3) are provided and in which the main valve is loaded in the closed position with the aid of a spring (24),   a) a piston (41) connected to the closing member of the main valve is arranged as a delay element in a cylinder (42) closed off at one end by an end wall, the piston being displaceable in a sealed manner in the said cylinder, b) a control passage (31) for the inflow passage of the fitting body is formed in the connecting piece between the closing element and the piston, the said control passage being passed through the piston (41) into the cylinder (42) via the control valve (3), and a throttling nozzle (43), which is connected to the outflow passage of the fitting body, being provided in parallel adjacent to the control passage, c) the control valve being actuable by means of a tappet (6) which can be displaced axially counter to the force of a return spring (61).   To improve the said self-closing valve, a bypass valve (422), which can be opened by pushing in the tappet, is provided in the end wall of the cylinder, the bypass valve being connected to the outflow passage of the fitting body by one or more passages (4222).

Self-closing valve for water outflow control, 
especially for sanitary installations, having a housing (1) 

which can be inserted into a fitment body (5) and in which 
a main valve (2) and a control valve (3) are provided and 

the main valve is urged tight into the closed position by 
means of a spring (24), wherein 


as retarding member a piston (41) connected to the 
closure member of the main valve is displaceable, 

sealed, in a cylinder (42) closed by a base at one 
end, 
in the connecting piece between the closure member and 
the piston, a control channel (31) to the inflow 

channel of the fitment body is formed which by way of 
the control valve (3) is led through the piston (41) 

into the cylinder (42), and, parallel and close to the 
control channel, a constriction nozzle (43), which 

communicates with the outflow channel of the fitment 
body, is provided in the piston, 
the control valve is arranged to be actuated by a 
plunger (6) displaceable axially against the force of 

a return spring (61), 
 
characterised in that in the base (421) of the cylinder 

(42) a bypass valve (422) is provided which is to be opened 
by pushing-in of the plunger (6), the bypass valve (422) 

being connected by way of one or more channels to the 
outflow channel (52) of the fitment body (5). 
Self-closing valve according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the bypass valve (422) controls an annular 

channel (4221) coaxial with the plunger (6) in the base 
(421) of the cylinder (42), the annular channel (4221) 

being closed by a seal (62) on the plunger (6) in the rest 
position of the plunger (6) and opened in the pushed-in  

 
position. 
Self-closing valve according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the annular channel (4221) is connected 

to the outflow channel (52) of the fitment body (5) 
by way of transverse bores (4222), formed in the base 

(421), and longitudinal slots, provided between the outer 
wall of the cylinder (42) and the housing (1), or a circumferential 

annular gap (11). 
Self-closing valve according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the outside diame
ter of the annular 
channel (4221) is approximately 1.02 times the diameter of 

the plunger (6), the diameter of the piston (41) corresponding 
approximately to five times the diameter of the 

plunger (6). 
Self-closing valve according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the cylinder (42) is screwed 

into the housing (1) by means of a screw thread (12) and is 
sealed to the housing (1) by at least one O-ring (13). 
Self-closing valve according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the housing (1) is rotationally 

symmetrical and stepped, the cylinder (42) being arranged 
to be inserted in the region of enlarged diameter, while 

the region abruptly reduced in diameter is arranged to be 
screwed by means of a screw thread (15) into the standardised 

opening of the fitment body (5), and on the end of the 
housing (1) that can be introduced into the fitment body 

(5) a seal (16) is arranged concentric with the valve seat 
(17) of the main valve (2), in such a way that in the 

screwed-in state the seal (16) bears against a valve seat 
(53), surrounding the inflow channel (51), of the fitment 

body (5) and sealingly connects the inflow channel (51) to 
the housing (1). 
Self-closing valve according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that on the outer end of the base 

(421) there is formed an annular groove (4211) in the 
bottom of which bears a return spring (61) for the plunger  

 
(6) and on the side wall of which there is arranged to be 

axially displaceable an adjusting screw (44) with which the 
depth of action of a grip piece (63), and thus the time
