<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to novel, therapeutically active oxazinoisoquinoline derivatives of formula (I), wherein R
<
1
>
 means hydrogen, a C1-4 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl-C1-4 alkyl group; one of R
<
2
>
 and R
<
3
>
 stands for a C1-4 alkoxy group and the other one represents a phenyl-C1-4 alkoxy group optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl group in the aromatic nucleus; and R
<
4
>
 stands for a phenyl group optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl group in the aromatic nucleus and their solvates, their individual optically active and geometric isomers and mixtures of isomers as well as acid additon salts thereof. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the above compounds and a process for their preparation. The compounds of formula (I) are capable of inhibiting the calcium uptake to brain cells and have a protective effect in hypobaric hypoxia. Thus, they are useful in the protection from brain injuries of hypoxic origin.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL SUBSTITUTED OXAZINOISOQUINOLINE DERIVATIVES, PHARMACEU¬ TICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAMEThis invention relates to novel, therapeutically active substituted oxazinoisoquinoline derivatives of the formula
 whereinR1 means hydrogen, a Cι_4alkyl, phenyl or phenyl-Ci-4alkyl group; one of R2 and R3 stands for a Cι_4alkoxy group and the other one represents a phenyl-Cι_4alkoxy group optionally substituted by a Cι_4alkyl group in the aromatic nucleus; andR4 stands for a phenyl group optionally substituted by aCι_4alkyl group in the aromatic nucleus, and their solvates, their individual optically active and geometric isomers, mixtures of such isomers as well as acid addition salts of these compounds formed with inorganic and organic acids.Furthermore, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions being useful for the prevention and treatment of brain injuries; as well as to a process for preparing the compounds of the invention and to a method for treatment and prevention of brain injuries in mammals.Ischaemia-induced neurochemical alterations are relatedA 4824-67 MR/JGSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 to ion fluxes through the cell membranes and subcellular me branes, respectively. However, the factor of key importan in the development of an ischaemia-induced injury is t increase in the intracellular free calcium level. The ceasi of energy supply for the cell causes the loss of the cellul calcium homeostatis. The release of potassium elicits me brane depolarization inducing the opening of the potentia dependent calcium channels. The entry of calcium to the ce partially proceeds through these potential-dependent cha nels. On the other hand, the increase in the sodium perm ability of the membrane induces an intense release excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) . The glutama released activates the receptor-dependent calcium channel permitting an additional calcium influx into the cell [ Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. £, 127 (1989)].The influx of calcium to the cell (pre- and postsynapt calcium influx) may initiate catabolic reactions. T increased intracellular calcium level elicits reactions si nificantly influencing the functions and integrity of t cell. (Such reactions are e.g.: lipolysis, proteolysis, d composition of microtubules, excessive protein phosphoryl ation.) [Central Nervous System Trauma, Chapter 37, page 513-532 (1984)]The mechanisms playing a role in the neurotoxicity o veratrine are similar to the ischaemia-induced neurochemica changes.
