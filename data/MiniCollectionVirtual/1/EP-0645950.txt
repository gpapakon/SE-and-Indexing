<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connecting member for the connection of
circuit substrates which connects circuit substrates electrically
and mechanically, and further relates to a simple method of
manufacturing multilayer circuit substrates by using the
connecting member.Recently, following the tendency of electronic devices
toward becoming smaller and lighter, a mounting substrate which
is a part of these devices is required to perform higher mounting
density. The mounting technique itself has become one of the
major elements in the field of development of new electronic
devices. This mounting technique can be divided into two
components: 1. surface mounting components such as semiconductors
or chip components, and 2. substrates for mounting and connecting
these components electrically including their mounting method. It
is widely known that semiconductors have increasingly larger chip
sizes and terminals for attaining higher integration density and
functional improvements. Therefore, the terminal pitch is
tending toward becoming narrower For example, terminal pitch is
0.3 mm at present, whereas the pitch was 0.5 mm in the past. If
the pitch were narrower than 0.3 mm, it would be difficult to
apply a conventional solder method for mounting. The chip on 
board (COB) technique, which mounts semiconductors directly on
substrates, will be considered more important in the future than
the well-known "package". Therefore, the COB technique has been
researched in various fields. Furthermore, the tendency toward
smaller chip components has developed so far that nowadays 1005
chip (1.0 × 0.5 mm) is used daily. Similar to the case with
semiconductors, it would be difficult to produce smaller chip
components than this size since the mounting method causes a
limit on size reduction. In addition, mounting costs would be
significantly higher.On the other hand, the dominant current in electronic
devices is moving toward digitalized circuits which are
accompanied by higher frequency and acceleration. As a result,
mounting substrates can no longer sidestep the noise and heat
problems. In order to cope with this problem of higher frequency
and acceleration, a usual method which is practiced at present is
to manufacture a prototype first, and then to modify it again, if
any problem should occur. Therefore, a great amount of time has
been spent for the development of electronic devices, and this
method prolongs the development period. It is desired in the
future that the development of substrates is conducted in such a
way
