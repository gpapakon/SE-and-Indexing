<CLAIMS>
A polypropylene film consisting of a layer which contains polypropylene and
resin, characterised in that the resin has an average molecular weight Mw of 2000 to

8000.
A polypropylene film according to claim 1, characterised in that the resin has
a mean molecular weight Mw of 2500 to 6500.
A polypropylene film according to one of claims 1 and/or 2, characterised in
that the resin has a softening point of 80 to 180°C and preferably 100 to 160°C.
A polypropylene film according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the proportion of resin with a molecular weight of less than 1000 is not more than

35% by weight and preferably at most 30% by weight in relation to the total weight of
resin.
A polypropylene film according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the resin is added in a quantity of 3 to 40% by weight and preferably 5 to 35% by

weight, respectively in relation to the weight of the film.
A polypropylene film according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that in the longitudinal and transverse directions, it has a permanent set value of

over 50% and preferably in the range from 50 to 90%.
A polypropylene film according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that it has isotropic mechanical properties. 
A method of producing the polypropylene film according to claim in which
the molten batch is extruded through a flat nozzle, the extruded film is pulled off a take-off

roll, the temperature of which is between 10 and 100°C, the film is biaxially stretched
with a longitudinal stretching ratio of 5:1 to 9:1 and a transverse stretching ratio of 5:1

to 9:1, the biaxially stretched film is heat-fixed, possibly corona-treated and then rolled
up.
A method according to claim 8, characterised in that the longitudinal stretching
of the film is carried out at 80 to 150°C and the transverse stretching at 120° to 170°C.
Use of the polypropylene film according to one or more of claims 1 to 7 for
twist-wrapping.
