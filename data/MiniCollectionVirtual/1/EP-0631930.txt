<ABSTRACT>
The invention allows a helicopter equipped with the "RAST" system to use either a "RAST" system or a ground-base grid system. The on-board "RAST" means are a telescopic cylinder (P) and a messenger cable (M). The adaptor (A) according to the invention includes a lower head for automatic anchoring into a grid (G), a support under which the head (40) is mounted, a first means which can be connected to the end of the messenger cable, and second means for fastening the said support in place under the cylinder (P) and thus making it fast in interaction with hooks forming part of the cylinder (P). The adaptor (A) is designed to be present on the ground, in proximity to a grid (G), and sent to the helicopter and raised automatically under the cylinder (P) by means of the messenger cable (M).

Adapter system for helicopter equipped with a system known as "RAST", allowing the 
aircraft to use a grid system on the ground;
 
the "RAST" system comprising, on board the helicopter, a telescopic cylinder (P) called the 

"probe", the inside of which is fitted with catches (PC) to lock the end of a cable known as 
"RA" located on the ground, and a messenger cable (M) with, on its free end, an end coupling 

(MR) comprising a housing containing a two-jaw clamp (10), said end coupling capable of 
being attached to the end of the "RA" cable and being lowered and raised through the said 

probe (P);
 
system comprising a lower anchoring head (40) capable of automatically engaging in a grid 

(G);
 
a support (20) under which are fitted the anchoring head (40) and a first device (31, 35) on the 

support (20) that is connectable with the coupling (MR) on the messenger cable (M), this 
system being characterized by the fact that it is fitted with catches (23) on the support (20) 

which act on the outside of the probe (P) when it is brought into contact with them by means 
of the messenger cable (M), and devices (28, 36) working together with the catches (PC) on 

the probe (P) to lock the catches (23) on the support in this constrained state which can be 
released from on board the helicopter;
 
the system being designed to be located on the ground near the grid (G) and carried to the 

helicopter and automatically fitted under the end of the probe by means of the messenger cable 
(M). 
System as per Claim 1, characterized in that its head (40) allowing anchorage in a grid 

(G) consists of a cylindrical pin (41) with a convex end and fitted with fingers (45) near that 
convex end, the fingers being oriented and mobile in the radial direction between the retracted 

position inside the pin (41) and an extended position;
 
devices actuating the fingers (45) and holding them in position, these devices acting from the 

armed state in response to penetration of the pin (41) into an opening in the grid (G) when the 
fingers (45) reach a position below the level of the smallest diameter of that opening,
 
and devices for unlocking the fingers (45) and rearming the said actuating and holding devices.  

 
System as per Claim 2, characterized in that arming of the devices actuating the fingers 
(45) and holding them in the extended position is ensured by a trigger system released by 

means of a nipple (57) located above the fingers (45) and sensitive to penetration into an 
opening in the grid (G). 
System as per Claim 3, characterized in that the said trigger system comprises a manual 
rearming cable (47). 
System as per one of the Claims numbered 2 to 4, characterized in that it also comprises 
a link part (70) between the support (20) and the anchoring head (40) in order to give the 

anchoring head a certain freedom of movement in transverse translation with respect to its 
centreline. 
System as per Claim 5, characterized in that the linking part (70) is joined to the support 
(20) on one side and on the anchoring head (40) on the other by two sliding devices (21, 72) 

and (60, 67) respectively, with these devices arranged perpendicularly, and in that spring return 
devices (74, 75, 76) are provided to ensure that the anchoring head (40) is centred under the 

intermediate part (70) when at rest. 
System as per one of the Claims numbered 1 to 6, characterized in that the support (20) 
is a plate the upper face of which is fitted with swivelling catches (23) arranged in a circle 

around its centre and designed to catch and secure the head (3) at the end of the part (P), with 
a central lock (28) being provided to maintain the catches (23) in the closed position, that lock 

being actuated by a central cable (31) extending upwards, the end of the cable being fitted with 
a bulge end (35) which constitutes the said device for connection with the coupling (MR) on 

the messenger cable (M) and, below the bulge end (35), a ring (36) working together with the 
catches (PC) inside the part (P) to secure the lock (28) in the locking position with the catches 

(23) in the closed state, the ring (36) being a sliding device that is pushed against the bulge end 
(35) by a spring (37), also comprising an upper peripheral flange (38) forming a groove around 

the bulge end (35), that groove being designed to engage and constrain the clamp jaws (10) of 
the coupling (MR) on the messenger cable (M) to ensure connection with the latter when the 

ring (36) is not held by the catches on the probe (PC). 
System as per Claim 7, characterized in that, on the plate (20), the catches are integrated 
in a circular flange (24) into which the head (3) of the part (P) fits. 
System as per Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the cable (31) is also fitted with a 
device (33) allowing its length to be adjusted.  

 
System as per one of the Claims numbered 7 to 9, characterized in that the cable (31) is 
also fitted with a guide (32), near the plate (20), so facilitating insertion of the cable into the 

part (P) and centring under the plate part (20).
