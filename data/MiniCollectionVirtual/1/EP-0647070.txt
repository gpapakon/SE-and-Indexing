<ABSTRACT>
A color separator (12) for a digital television receiver (10). The 
incoming television signal is directed to two different paths in the color 

separator (12). Along a first path, the luminance component is separated by 
an analog L separator (12a), and then sampled by an A/D converter (12b) at a 

rate that will provide a desired number of samples per display line. Along a 
second path, the composite signal is sampled by an A/D converter (12c) at a 

rate appropriate for digital color separation, and then the chrominance 
samples are separated using a digital C separator (12d). A scaling unit (12e) 

then scales the chrominance samples to provide a desired number of samples 
per line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to television receivers, and more particularly to
sampling an input video signal to obtain pixel data for varying display
formats.In many television broadcast signals, notably those adhering to the
NTSC, PAL and CCAM standards, for example, there is a defined
relationship between the horizontal line frequency (Fh) and the color
subcarrier frequency (Fsc). For example, in NTSC signals, luminance and
chrominance are transmitted in a single channel by using a chrominance
subcarrier at 3.58 MHz, which is equal to the line frequency, 15,734.26 Hz,
times 455/2. This relationship makes it possible to separate luminance and
chrominance components in the television receiver, thus avoiding
interference between them prior to the recovery of the primary color signals
for display.In digital television systems that follow NTSC standards, typical
digital color separation algorithms call for a sampling rate that is some
multiple of the 3.58 MHz subcarrier frequency. A commonly used sampling
rate is approximately 14.318 MHz, referred to as the "4 fsc" rate. It results in
approximately 763 samples of active video data per line.A problem with the 4 fsc sampling rate is that it is not always
consistent with the sampling rate required for a desired number of pixels per
line (horizontal resolution). For example, today's enhanced definition
television systems, such as "wide NTSC", call for an image that is wider than 
previous images, with an aspect ratio of 16:9. The desired aspect ratio and
the available number of lines per frame determine the horizontal resolution.The simplest sampling methods provide one sample per pixel. But, in
general, the sampling rates for NTSC color separation and for a desired
aspect ratio are not the same. For example, for a 480 line display with a 4:3
aspect ratio, 640 pixels per line are required. However, as stated above, the 4
fsc sampling rate for NTSC color separation results in 763 samples per line.
This requires some sort of means for providing samples for the desired
horizontal resolution.Some existing systems provide the required number of pixels per line
by first sampling the incoming data at 4 fsc or some other color burst-related
sampling rate, performing color separation, and then scaling the samples to
the desired horizontal resolution. However, a problem with scaling is that
visual artifacts are likely to occur. Also, the increased complexity of such
systems makes them more costly.One aspect of the invention is a color separator for a video signal
receiver,
