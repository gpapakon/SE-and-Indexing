<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measurement cell and a method for carrying out electrochemoluminescence (ECL) measurements. The measurement cell has a sample space in which a working electrode and an opposite electrode are located, the opposite electrode being arranged in such a way that it is located in the optical path between the working electrode and the optical detector.
