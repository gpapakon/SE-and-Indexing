Disclosed herein is a process for producing an 
optically active aldehyde represented by the following 

formula (2):


OHC-CH(CH₃)-Q   (2)



 
wherein Q means a halogen atom, lower alkyl group, 

phthalimide group, lower alkylcarbonyloxy group, cyano 
group, carboxyl group, lower alkyloxycarbonyl group, lower 

alkoxy group, lower alkylcarbonyl group, acetylamino 
group, benzoylamino group, monoalkylamino group, dialkylamino 

group, benzoyl group, phenyl group which may be 
substituted by a halogen atom, lower alkyl group or lower 

alkoxy group, or naphthyl group which may be substituted 
by a halogen atom, lower alkyl group or lower alkoxy 

group, which comprises hydroformylating a vinyl compound

specific rhodium-phosphine complex as a catalyst. 
According to the process, optically active aldehydes which 

require much labor and time to synthesize, and are 
expensive can be produced at a high yield and a low cost 

by a simple process under mild conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing optically active aldehydes, and more
particularly to a process for producing an optically
active aldehyde represented by the following formula (2)
using a vinyl compound represented by the following
formula (1), carbon monoxide and hydrogen as starting
materials.
CH2=CH-QOHC-CH(CH3)-Q
wherein Q means a halogen atom, lower alkyl group,
phthalimide group, lower alkylcarbonyloxy group, cyano
group, carboxyl group, lower alkyloxycarbonyl group, lower
alkoxy group, lower alkylcarbonyl group, acetylamino
group, benzoylamino group, monoalkylamino group, dialkylamino
group, benzoyl group, phenyl group which may be
substituted by a halogen atom, lower alkyl group or lower
alkoxy group, or naphthyl group which may be substituted
by a halogen atom, lower alkyl group or lower alkoxy
group. Asymmetric hydroformylation reactions have
heretofore attracted much attention in the field of
synthetic organic chemistry because of their good
practical utility upon synthesis of optically active
aldehydes. In particular, in order to achieve both high
regioselectivity (ratio of branched chain to linear
chain) and high stereoselectivity in a step wherein a
carbon-carbon bond is formed, a great deal of effort has
been given to the development of a effective catalyst for
asymmetric synthesis. For example, rhodium or platinum
complexes modified by an optically active diphosphine have
been used as catalysts.However, results obtained to date have been not
satisfactory in many cases from the viewpoint of synthetic
chemistry. When the platinum catalyst is used in an
asymmetric hydroformylation reaction, its reaction rate is
generally slow, and besides there is a tendency for the
hydrogenation reaction of a starting material to
competitively progress. The use of the rhodium catalyst
solves such drawbacks. However, such a catalyst does not
entirely have no problems.There have been several attempts to asymmetrically
hydroformylate vinyl acetate to obtain optically active 2-acetoxypropanal.
For example, according to C. F. Hobbs
and W. S. Knowles, J. Org. Chem., 46, 4422 (1981), vinyl
acetate is asymmetrically hydroformylated using a mixture 
of DIPHOL and Rh(cod)(acac) as a catalyst to achieve an
optical purity of 51% ee at the highest.The present inventors effected an asymmetric
hydroformylation reaction of vinyl acetate using a rhodium
catalyst containing, as a ligand, bis(triarylphosphite)
which is easier to synthesize than DIPHOL and reported it
in Tetrahedron Asymmetry, 3(5),
