<ABSTRACT>
In a device (12) for feeding a refuse-sorting plant (10) with the contents of refuse bags, a feeder device (14) for the refuse bags is followed by an obliquely ascending conveyor track (16) which is suitable for supporting and transporting refuse bags and their contents and which terminates at its upper end above the feed point of a conveyor traversing the sorting region. Arranged above the conveyor track (16), near its upper end, is a deflector rake (22) which is pivotable about an axis (30) spanning the conveyor track (16) and the prongs (32) of which approach one another obliquely downwards opposite to the conveying direction of the conveyor track (16), in a receiving position of the conveyor track (16), and can be moved out of this receiving position opposite the conveying direction into a throw-back position lifted off from the conveyor track (16). The deflector rake (22) can be driven in a movement going to and fro between the receiving position and the throw-back position. Tearing-open devices (40) assigned to the refuse bags extend from a mounting (34) following the deflector rake (22) in the conveying direction, so as to engage through the interspaces between the prongs (32) and increase their distance from the conveyor track (16) opposite to the conveying direction, the said tearing-open devices (40) being jointly pivotable out of a basic position counter to a restoring force about an axis (36) spanning the conveyor track (16), the conveying movement along the feeder device (14) being regulatable in dependence on the angular position of the tearing-open devices (40) in relation to the basic position.

content of refuse sacks, with a conveyor path and ripping devices as 

well as a deflector rake, which are pivotably arranged above the 
conveyor path, characterised thereby that the obliquely rising 

conveyor path (16), which is connected to a bring-up device (14) for 
the refuse sacks and is suitable for the deposit and transport of 

refuse sacks and the content thereof, ends by its upper end above the 
loading point of a conveyor extending across the sorting region, that 

the deflector rake (22; 122), which is pivotable about an axis (30) 
extending transversely over the conveyor path and the tines (32; 132) 

of which in a pick-up setting approach the conveyor path (16) while 
being inclined upwards against the conveying direction of the 

conveyor path (16) and are movable out of this pick-up setting 
against the conveying direction and into a retracted setting raised 

from the conveyor path (16), is arranged above the conveyor path (16) 
near its upper end, that the deflector rake (22; 122) is drivable to 

a movement going back and forth between the pick-up setting and the 
retracted setting and that ripping devices (40), which engage through 

the intermediate spaces between the tines (32; 132), enlarge in their 
spacing from the conveyor path (16) against the conveying direction, 

are associated with the refuse sacks and are each pivotable against a 
restoring force out of a basic position about a common axis (36) 

extending transversely to the conveyor path (16), extend out from a 
mounting (34) following the deflector rake (22; 122) in conveying 

direction, wherein the conveying movement along the bring-up device 
(14) can be regulated in dependence on an element (40) monitoring the 

material flow along the conveyor path (16). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
spacing between the deflector rake (22; 122) and the conveyor path 

(16) is settable. 
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised thereby 
that the tines (132) of the deflector rake (122) are mounted at a 

lever (70), which is pivotable about the pivot axis (30) of the  
 

deflector rake, to be movable about an axis (72), which is parallel 
to the pivot axis (30) of the deflector rake and in the pick-up 

setting disposed in front of the pivot axis (30) and in front of the 
free tine ends against the conveying direction, and are fixed in 

their basic setting against the conveying direction by a spring (74) 
tensionable in the case of overloading. 
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised thereby 
that the tines of the deflector rake are mounted at a lever, which is 

pivotable about the pivot axis of the deflector rake, to be movable 
about an axis, which is parallel to the pivot axis of the diverter 

rake and in the pick-up setting is disposed in front of the pivot 
axis and in front of the free tine ends against the conveyor 

direction, and are displaceable by a setting device for a 
predetermined time period out of their basic setting in conveying 

direction, that the setting device is triggered by a signal, which is 
issued by a sensor device following the deflector rake in conveying 

direction, sofar as the material flow on the conveyor path remains 

uninterrupted during a predetermined time period. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby that the tines (32) of the deflector rake (22) extend at a 

slightly obtuse angle against the conveying direction relative to the
