<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an addition polymerization wherein a particular catalyst is used. More particularly the present invention relates to an improved method using a class of catalysts known as constrained geometry catalysts.In EP-A-416,815 there are disclosed certain constrained geometry metal complexes and catalysts derived by reacting the metal complex with activating cocatalysts. In EP-A-418,044 there are disclosed certain cationic constrained geometry metal catalysts formed by reacting such metal complexes with salts of Bronsted acids containing a noncoordinating compatible anion. The reference discloses the fact that such complexes are usefully employed as catalysts in addition polymerizations. In EP-A-520,732, published December 30, 1992, an alternative technique for preparing cationic constrained geometry catalysts by anion abstraction using borane compounds is disclosed.It has been previously known in the art to employ carbonium, oxonium or sulfonium ions to generate cationic bis-cyclopentadienyl Group 4 metal catalysts. Such a process is disclosed in EP-A-426,637 published May 8, 1991.It would be desirable if there were provided an improved method that would allow the production of even more efficient catalysts as well as an improved addition polymerization process utilizing such catalysts.As a result of investigations carried out by the present inventors there is now discovered a new and improved method for the preparation of catalysts and an improved method for polymerization of addition polymerizable monomers.In accordance with the present invention there is provided an addition polymerization process wherein one or more addition polymerizable monomers are polymerized in the presence of a catalyst obtained by the process for preparing a cationic complex having a limiting charge separated structure corresponding to the formula:
        (I)     LMXmX'nX''p+A-,
wherein:
L is a single, delocalized π-bonded group that is bound to M, containing up to 50 nonhydrogen atoms;M is a metal of Group 4 or the Lanthanide series of the Periodic Table of the Elements;X is a divalent substituent of up to 50 nonhydrogen atoms that together with L forms a metallocycle with M that imparts a constrained geometry to the metal active site;X' is a neutral Lewis base ligand having up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms;m and n are independently zero or one;X" each occurrence is a monovalent moiety selected from hydride, halo, alkyl, aryl, silyl, germyl, aryloxy, alkoxy, amide, siloxy, and combinations thereof said moiety
