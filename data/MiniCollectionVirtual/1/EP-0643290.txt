<ABSTRACT>
Cranes are equipped with brakes to hold the load hanging on the hook securely at the respective height when no lifting or lowering is envisaged. For this purpose, as a function of the use, double-shoe brakes, disc brakes or brake motors are predominantly used. These brakes are designed only for the two conditions "brake off" and "brake on". The braking force is dimensioned such that the maximum load hanging on the crane is held securely. As a result, even at a low load, a maximum braking torque is produced. For checking the serviceability of the brake, checks are carried out in a specific rotation. Disturbances of the function lying in between them are often not detected. The invention is directed towards measuring the magnitude of the braking torque and further relevant influencing factors and, as a function thereof, to dimension the braking force to be only so large that the load is securely held. For this purpose, a device having corresponding functional units is provided, which can be matched to the respective conditions of use. Specific solutions are disclosed for the brake torque detection for drum brakes and disc brakes as well as brake motors. The solution has above all the advantage that the brakes can be continuously tested, monitored and controlled and braking forces are produced which are only as large as are strictly necessary. As a result, the operational reliability and the lifetime of the wearing parts are increased. Rotational checking of the brakes on crane installations, using test weights, is thus no longer necessary.
