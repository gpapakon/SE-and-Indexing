<ABSTRACT>
A lifting cushion includes an inflatable envelope (2), a first layer (4) and a second layer (6). The envelope (2) includes two rectangular sheets (8 and 10) of woven polyaramid cloth. The sheets (8 and 10) are connected either by a very large number of closely adjacent polyaramid filaments (12) or a series of cell structures (58) made of polyaramid or polyester sheet. The first layer (4) is wrapped around the envelope (2) with the direction of reinforcement (20) extending in the direction (23). The second layer (6) is wrapped around the first layer (4) with the direction of reinforcement (33) running perpendicularly to the direction of reinforcement (23) of the sheet (20). The first and second layers are made of polyaramid and coated with a neoprene layer on both their upper and lower surfaces. An air valve is inserted in one corner of the envelope (2). The envelope (2) and first and second layers (4 and 6) are heated, compressed and hot vulcanised to secure these components to one another during manufacture of the lifting cushion.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A LIFTING CUSHIONThe present invention relates to a lifting cushion for supporting, raising or moving objects.Lifting cushions of the invention may for example be used for rescuing people who are trapped by collapsible walls, girders, concrete slabs or heavy road vehicles. This lifting cushion can also be used for prising steering columns, removing windscreens and for forcing doors. Industrial uses of these lifting cushions include lifting heavy machinery, rail locomotives and pipelines, supporting tensioning in mining, splitting slabs in quarries, and use as compression or spreader elements.In operation, the lifting cushion in placed in its flattened condition beneath the object to be raised. The cushion is then inflated thereby raising the object. If further lift is required one or more additional lifting cushions may be inserted one above the other and subsequently inflated to provide a required degree of lift of the object.In order to provide a maximum lifting force the lifting cushions are generally of rectangular form. With the previously known lifting cushions the problem arises that when the cushion is inflated the cushion changes from its non-inflated flat rectangular form to a form having a generally oval vertical cross-section. This change in shape of the cushion considerably reduces the contact area between the cushion and the object to be raised thereby producing a corresponding reduction in the lifting force that can be applied by the cushion to the object. There is also a significant risk arising from the difficulty of calculating the force required to lift 

the object from the trapped person or to gain clearance to insert cribbage. It will be appreciated that this change of shape in the cushions makes it extremely difficult to provide sufficient stability to be able to use a plurality of cushions one on top of the other.It is an aim of the invention to alleviate the above- mentioned disadvantages, and according to the present invention there is provided a lifting cushion comprising an air-tight inflatable envelope having two major opposed faces, a first layer extending around the envelope, and means for retaining said two major faces of the envelope at a preselected attitude to one another when the envelope is inflated.The said means may comprise a plurality of closely adjacent filaments extending between and connected to the two major opposed faces of the envelope. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the filaments may be polyaramid filaments but the invention is not restricted

CLAIMS
1. A lifting cushion comprising an air-tight inflatable envelope (2) having two major opposed faces (8) and (10) , a first layer (4) extending around the envelope, and means for retaining said two major faces of the envelope at a preselected attitude to one another when the envelope is inflated.
2. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 1 in which the said means comprises a plurality of closely adjacent filaments (12) extending between and connected to the two major opposed faces of the envelope.
3. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 2 in which the filaments are made of polyaramid material.
4. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3 in which the filaments are all of substantially the same length.
5. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 1 in which the said means comprises a plurality of cell structures 58 extending between the two major faces 8 and 10 of the envelope 2.
6. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 5, in which each cell structure 58 is of rectangular cross- section.
7. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 6 in which each cell structure is formed from sheet material folded to have two overlapping end portions (60) and (62). 


8. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 5, 6 or 7, in which each cell structure is made from a polyaramid material.
9. A lifting cushion as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the first layer (4) extends in a first direction and is folded around the envelope (2) •
10. A lifting cushion as claimed in any preceding claim, including a second layer (6) extending in a second direction and being folded around the said first layer (4).
11. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 10 in which the folded over regions of the second layer (6) are on the opposite side of the lifting cushion to the folded over regions of the first layer (4) .
12. A lifting cushion as claimed in claim 9 or claim 10 in which said first and second directions are at 90° to one another.
13. A lifting cushion as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, and in which the first layer (4) comprises two sheet portions which are laid one on each of the associated major faces (8) and (10) of the envelope (2), and folded over the sides of the envelope.
14. A lifting cushion as claimed in any preceding claim in which the major opposed faces of the envelope (2) are made of woven polyaramid cloth.
15. A lifting cushion as claimed any one of claims 1 to 13, in which the major opposed faces of the envelope are made of polyaramid cord superimposed with a steel 


tyre cord.
16. A lifting cushion as claimed in any preceding claim in which the exterior upper and lower surfaces of the envelope (2) are coated with an air holding rubber compound.
17. A lifting cushion comprising a plurality of units in which each unit is as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 16.
18. A lifting cushion substantially as herein described and shown in the accompanying drawings.
