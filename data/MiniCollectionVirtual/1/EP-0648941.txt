<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements to 
pneumatic linear actuators, and concerns more 
particularly a pneumatic cylinder provided with 
pneumatic damping means and a mechanical stop whose 
position can be axially adjusted in order to modify 
the effective working stroke of the actuator itself. Pneumatic dampers are widely used in linear actuators 
to absorb most of the kinetic energy of the load by 
decelerating the piston at the end of the working 
stroke. In general these pneumatic dampers are 
provided on the closure heads of the cylinder and are 
based on the principle of dissipation of energy by 
releasing a predetermined quantity of pressurised air 
through a throttling valve at the end of each stroke 
of the piston. The dampers of this type generally 
have a fixed position, which cannot be adjusted or 
modified, so that they would be totally ineffective 
in the case wherein it is necessary to change the 
mechanical stop which limits the effective working 
stroke of the piston. With traditional pneumatic  
 
dampers it is therefore impossible to regulate their 
position, especially on the side relating to the 
piston rod, nor are suitable solutions to this 
problem known. For these reasons use is generally made of 
independent mechanical stops and hydraulic damping 
systems outside the actuator. The use of outer hydraulic systems for decelerating 
the piston, adjustable externally, in general 
requires complex solutions, which cannot always be 
adopted in certain working conditions, in that an 
hydraulic damper added to a pneumatic cylinder not 
only creates greater bulk, but is also a source of 
possible further causes of malfunctioning. It has not been possible to date to dispose of 
pneumatic actuators provided with an integrated 
pneumatic damping and piston stop device which is an 
integral part of the same actuator and which at the 
same time allows adjustment of its position in order 
to adapt to any change in the effective working 
stroke of the piston.  The object of the present invention is to provide a 
linear actuator provided with an integrated pneumatic 
damping and stop device as mentioned above which can 
be applied to cylinders both with and without rod, 
and which allows simultaneous regulation both of the 
mechanical stop and of the pneumatic damping device. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a pneumatic linear actuator, as related 
above, provided with an adjustable pneumatic damping 
means, which is able to maintain its damping 
efficiency
