<ABSTRACT>
A flip top closure device for a dispensing opening of a container 
(11), comprising a first body member (14) with a flip top (15) to be 

mounted on the container (11), and a second body member (12) mounted on 
the first body member (14) and having a part (32) which is usually in 

overlapping relation with the flip top (15) to prevent opening thereof, 
which part (32) is displaceable from said overlapping relation to 

expose a lip (33) of the flip top (15) to allow opening thereof and 
which, by virtue of spring tabs (36) which provide restorative force, 

will return to the overlapping position without need for external 
physical manipulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flip top closure. Hinged closures which are designed to be child resistant, also 
referred to as "flip top" closures incorporate a base and a lid. The 
base can engage a container, and incorporates a top surface having an 
opening. The lid is attached to the base by a connection such as a 
hinge so that the lid is movable, relative to the base, between closed 
and open positions. In the closed position, the lid overlies the top 
surface of the base and occludes the opening, whereas in the open 
position the lid is remote from the opening. When the base is secured 
to a mouth of the container, the lid controls access to the contents of 
the container. The base, lid and hinge may be moulded as elements of 
a single, integral piece of plastics material. Various attempts have been made to provide child resistant flip 
top closures having features which impede opening of the lid by a child 
but which permit opening of the lid by an adult. Such child-resistance 
features are useful where the closure is employed on a container 
holding a toxic or otherwise hazardous material. Patent specification GB-A-2 158 048 discloses a flip top cap 
having a ring movably mounted to the base. In the normal position of 
the ring, the ring protrudes upwardly from the base and surrounds the 
lid when the lid is in the closed position. Thus, the periphery of the 
lid is inaccessible, and a child cannot engage the lid to move it from 
the closed position to the open position. An adult can move the ring 
downwardly relative to the base so as to gain access to the lid, but a 
child normally cannot accomplish the required twisting and sliding 
motion. The closure shown in patent specification US-A-3 584 760 utilizes 
a guard ring rotatable relative to the base with a separate spring to 
bias the guard ring. These features add cost the complexity to such a 
device, and, significantly, suffer from the disadvantage that the 
covering member must be physically manipulated back from the uncovered 
to the covered position. In other words, without such manipulation 
after use of the closure, the container contents remain accessible to 
children. Others have attempted to make a satisfactory child resistant flip  
 
top closure having all of its element moulded in a single piece. As 
disclosed in patent specification US-A-3 556 331 and US-A- 3 604 585, 
the lid may have an elongate, rectangular shape, whereas the base may 
have a narrow slot in its top surface. When the lid is in its closed 
position, it is

<CLAIMS>
A flip top closure device (10) for a dispensing opening of a 
container (11), comprising a first body member (14) with a flip top 

(15) to be mounted on the container (11) and an aperture (19) providing 
access to the dispensing opening of the container (11), and a second 

body member (12) mounted on the first body member (14) and having a 
part (23) which in its normal position is in overlapping relation with 

the flip top (15) to prevent opening thereof, which part (23) is 
displaceable from said overlapping relation to expose a lip (33) of the 

flip top (15) to allow opening thereof, and which part (23) is returned 
to overlapping relation with the flip top (15) without need for 

external physical manipulation by virtue of spring members (36) located 
on one of the body members (12,14) which produce a restorative force on 

the second body member (12). 
A closure according to claim 1, wherein the flip top (15) of the 
first body (14) cannot be raised and the corresponding aperture (19) 

accessed without displacing the second body member (12). 
A closure according to claim 1, wherein the spring tabs (36) are 
located on an upper wall of the first body member (14). 
A closure according to claim 1, wherein the spring tabs (36) are 
located on an upper wall (23) of the second body member (12). 
A child-resistant flip top closure (10) to seal an open-topped 
container (11) having an external screw thread (18) formed on the neck 

of the container (11), the closure (10) comprising; 
   an outer cap (12) having a first top end wall (23) and a first 

skirt (21) depending from the outer edge thereof; 
   an inner cap (14) having a second top end wall (35), a flip top 

(15) and a dispensing aperture (19) formed through the second top end 
wall (35), and an internally threaded second skirt (13) depending from 

the outer edge of the second top end wall (35) for engagement with the 
external screw thread (18) on the container (11), the outer cap (12) 

overlying the inner cap (14) and being concentric therewith;
 

   the first top end wall (23) of the outer cap (12) having a second 
aperture (22) large enough to receive the flip top (15); and 

   a plurality of spring tabs (36) integrally attached to and 
extending radially upwardly from said second top end wall (35); 

   such that when the outer cap (12) and the inner cap (14) are 
assembled, the first skirt (21) of the first top wall (23) is 

positioned in overlapping relation with the flip top (15) and the 
spring tabs (36) contact the underside of the first top wall (23) of 

the outer cap (12) so as to maintain the overlapping relation of the 
first skirt (21) with the flip top (15). 
A flip top closure according to claim 5, wherein the flip top 
(15) is attached to the second top end wall (35) by a hinge arrangement 

(27). 
A flip top closure according to claim 6, wherein the hinge 
arrangement (27) is of the ball and socket hinge type. 
A flip top closure according to claim 5, further comprising: 
   first ratchet teeth (26) on an inner face of the first skirt 

member (21) of the outer cap (12) abutting with corresponding ramp 
members (28) on the outer face of the second skirt member (13) of the 

inner cap (14) when the outer cap (12) is turned in the application 
direction to rotate the two caps (12,14) together and causing the 

internal threads (16) on the inner cap (14) to cooperate with the 
external screw threads (18) on the container (11) to fasten the closure 

on the container (11); and 
   the first ratchet teeth (26) on the first skirt member (13) of 

the outer cap member (12) ramping over the ramp members (28) of the 
outer face of the second skirt member (13) when a reverse torque is 

applied on the outer cap member (12), thereby preventing inadvertent 
removal of the closure (10) from the container (11).
