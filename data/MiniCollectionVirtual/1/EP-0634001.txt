<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION OF MAGNETIC COMPASSESDESCRIPTION TECHNICAL FIELD:The invention relates to magnetic compasses, and is especially concerned with automatic calibration of magnetic compasses. The invention is especially, but not exclusively, applicable to magnetic compasses for use with terrestrial vehicles such as automobiles.BACKGROUND ART:Known magnetic compasses used in vehicles comprise a sensor, for example a so-called flux gate sensor or a Hall effect sensor, and an electronic circuit for deriving, from the signals produced by the sensor, the magnitude and direction of the terrestrial magnetic field sensed by the sensor.If there were no distortions, the terrestrial magnetic field vector displayed by the magnetic compass would sweep out a perfect circle, with its origin corresponding to the datum of the compass, as the vehicle was rotated through a complete circle. In practice, however, when a magnetic compass is used in a vehicle, the magnetic field sensed by the sensor is distorted by what are known as "hard-iron" effects and "soft- iron" effects, which result from permanent and induced magnetism, respectively, of the vehicle.Soft-iron effect depends primarily upon the geometry of the vehicle and the permeability of the metal it comprises. Soft-iron effect produces a two-cycle error in 360 degrees, which causes the locus swept by the measured magnetic field vector to assume an elliptical pattern with its eccentricity varying as a function of degrees of error. The peak error due to the soft-iron effect might be as much as 20° to 30°, though usually it will be less than 10° for most locations on a vehicle.Hard-iron effects are caused primarily by metal surrounding the sensor acting as a secondary source of emission. Hence, expansion and contraction of the metal 

surrounding the magnetic compass, together with vibration and other strong magnetic perturbations, cause the origin of the ellipse to deviate as a function of the amplitude and phase of the vector representing the hard-iron perturbation, typically producing a one-cycle error in 360 degrees.If valid heading readings are to be obtained, the magnetic compass must be calibrated to compensate for these distortions. Manual correction techniques involve the positioning of small magnets around the sensor to compensate for perturbing magnetic fields. This process is fairly complex since the adjustments are made by positioning the vehicle at different angles while a skilled technician adjusts the positions of the small
