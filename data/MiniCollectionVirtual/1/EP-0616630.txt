<ABSTRACT>
Mixtures of salts composed of Mg((NO3)2.6H2O and LiNO3 at a mutual ratio by mass comprised between 86-81 and 14-19 are useful for storing and using thermal energy as phase transition heat. They are particularly suitable as latent heat accumulator media in heat accumulators for storing and using the lost heat from motor vehicle engines.
