<ABSTRACT>
Device for smoothing phase jumps likely to affect a clock signal, and signalled beforehand by a signal called phase-jump indication signal, characterised in that it includes:   - means (1) called delay means for applying to the pulses of the said clock signal a delay which, in the absence of phase jumps, is constant and equal to a value called nominal value, denoted No, and, in the presence of a phase jump, instantaneously, for the pulse of the said clock signal affected by this phase jump, becomes equal to Nc+N or to Nc-N according to whether the said phase jump has an amplitude equal to -N or to +N, where Nc designates the delay applied to the pulse of the said clock signal preceding that affected by this phase jump, then, for a set of following pulses, varies progressively, for the phase jump in question, as appropriate from Nc+N to Nc or from Nc-N to Nc, the nominal value No being deterined in such a way that the said delay values remain positive even in the case of consecutive positive phase jumps, - means (2) controlled by the said phase-jump indication signal, for determining the said delay values.
