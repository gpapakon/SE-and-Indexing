<ABSTRACT>
An embossed sheet (S) coated at least partially with expanded graphite and suitable for use as a gasket (G) or as a component layer of a gasket, is manufactured by positioning a planar metallic sheet (10) between an upper embossing die (14) and a lower embossing die (18) with a layer of particles of expanded graphite (22) between one of said dies and a surface of the sheet (10). One of the dies (14) has a protuberance (16) to emboss a ridge (R) into the sheet (10) while the other die (18) has a recess (20) to receive the ridge (R). The method also comprises pressing the dies (14, 18) together to cause the particles to coalesce and form a coating (24) attached to the sheet (10) while simultaneously embossing said ridge (R) into the sheet (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a method of 
manufacturing an embossed metallic sheet coated at least 
partially with expanded graphite and suitable for use as a 
gasket or as a component layer of a gasket. Many gaskets for use in industrial and automotive 
applications comprise a metallic sheet, often of steel, 
coated on one or more surfaces with a sealing material. 
The sealing material is, in some cases, expanded graphite 
which has been compacted. Expanded graphite is also called 
"exfoliated graphite". The normal method of coating such a metallic sheet is 
to make a thin (0.2 to 1.5mm thick) self-supporting foil of 
the expanded graphite and to attach the foil to a surface 
of the reinforcing sheet. This method, however, involves 
making and handling the thin foil which is easily damaged 
and so requires extreme care. Instead of applying an already made foil to the 
reinforcing sheet, it is known (see eg EP-A- 0 052 485) to 
position a substantially planar metallic sheet between an 
upper and a lower die with a layer of particles of expanded 
graphite between one of said dies and a surface of the 
sheet, and to press said dies together thereby compressing 
the particles of expanded graphite, so that they coalesce 
and form a coating attached to said sheet. It is known to provide rubber coated gaskets with 
embossed ridges, e.g. a generally semi-circular (in cross-section) 
ridge, around the hole in the gasket (see, for  
 
example, EP-A-0 338 536). These ridges are resilient and 
cause controlled stress concentrations during use of the 
gasket. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
efficient method of manufacturing an embossed metallic 
sheet coated at least partially with expanded graphite and 
suitable for use as a gasket or as a component layer of a 
gasket. The invention provides a method of manufacturing an 
embossed metallic sheet coated at least partially with 
expanded graphite and suitable for use as a gasket or as a 
component layer of a gasket, the method comprising 
positioning a substantially planar metallic sheet between 
an upper embossing die and a lower embossing die with a 
layer of particles of expanded graphite between one of said 
dies and a surface of the sheet, one of said dies having at 
least one protuberance arranged to emboss a ridge into the 
sheet and the other of said dies having a corresponding 
recess complementary to the protuberance, the method also 
comprising pressing said dies together thereby compressing 
the particles of expanded graphite,

A method of manufacturing an embossed metallic sheet 
(S) coated at least partially with expanded graphite 

and suitable for use as a gasket (G) or as a component 
layer of a gasket, the method comprising positioning 

a substantially planar metallic sheet (10) between an 
upper embossing die (14) and a lower embossing die 

(18) with a layer (22) of particles of expanded 
graphite between one of said dies and a surface of the 

sheet, one of said dies having at least one 
protuberance (16) arranged to emboss a ridge (R) into 

the sheet (10) and the other of said dies having a 
corresponding recess (20) complementary to the 

protuberance, the method also comprising pressing said 
dies together thereby compressing the particles of 

expanded graphite, so that they coalesce and form a 
coating (24) attached to said sheet, and 

simultaneously embossing the ridge into the sheet and 
the coating. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
said layer (22) of particles is positioned by 

providing a particle retaining wall (26) surrounding 
the lower embossing die (18) and projecting upwardly 

therefrom to a substantially equal extent around the 
periphery of the wall, filling the space defined by 

the wall above the lower die with particles of 
expanded graphite, and skimming the particle layer 

level with the top of said wall, the planar metallic 
sheet (10) then being positioned on top of the layer 

of particles. 
A method according to either one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that a further layer of particles  

 
(32) is positioned between said planar sheet (10) and 

the other of said dies (14,18), and the two layers are 
pressed into coatings (24,34) simultaneously. 
A method according to Claim 3 when dependent on Claim 
2, characterised in that the further layer (32) of 

particles is positioned by raising said wall (26) 
relative to the lower die (18) after positioning the 

planar sheet (10), filling the space defined by said 
wall above the planar sheet with particles, and 

skimming the further particle layer level with the top 
of said wall. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the method comprises providing a particle retaining 

wall (26) surrounding the lower embossing die (18) and 
projecting upwardly therefrom to a substantially equal 

extent around the periphery of the wall, positioning 
the planar sheet (10) on the lower die (18) within 

said wall (26), filling the space defined by the wall 
above the planar sheet with particles of expanded 

graphite, and skimming the particle layer level with 
the top of the wall. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that at least one hole (H) is cut out 

from the sheet in two stages, a first stage in which 
a smaller hole (50) is punched out, the first stage being 

performed before the expanded graphite is applied to 
the planar sheet (10), and a second, hole trimming, 

stage in which the hole (50) is enlarged by punching out a 
ring around it, the second stage being performed on the embossed 

sheet (S). 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that during the application of 

expanded graphite to said planar sheet (10), a hole  
 

(H) therein is blanked off by a further protuberance 
(60) from one of said dies (14,18) which enters a 

corresponding recess (62) in the other die. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the method also comprises 

applying a layer of adhesive (12) to one or both 
surfaces of the planar sheet (10) before it is 

positioned between the dies. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the particles have their mean 

dimensions in the range 0.2 to 2mm. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 10,
