<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of cellular polyurethane mouldings having a compact surface without using CFCs by reacting starting materials known per se which react to give polyurethane foams in closed moulds, using, as a blowing agent, carbamates obtainable from aliphatic amino alcohols and carbon dioxide, optionally in addition to further blowing agents. The process is particularly suitable for the production of foam sheathing of steering wheels, spoilers and of protective cushions in the passenger compartment of automobiles or for the production of shoe soles or shoe components.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the CFC-free preparation of cellular
polyurethane mouldings having a compact surface by the

reaction in closed moulds of a reaction mixture
comprising


A) a polyisocyanate component having an NCO content
of from 18 to 33.6 wt.%, consisting of at least

one, optionally chemically modified,
polyisocyanate or mixture of polyisocyanates of

the diphenylmethane series,
B) a polyol component having an average hydroxyl
functionality of 2 to 3, consisting of at least

one polyether polyol in the molecular weight
range of from 2,000 to 10,000 and/or at least one

polyester polyol in the molecular weight range of
from 2,000 to 10,000,
C) at least one compound which is difunctional in
the isocyanate polyaddition reaction and is in

the molecular weight range of from 62 to 1,999,
in a quantity of from 2 to 15 wt.%, based on the

weight of component B),

2
 and R
3
represent identical or different groups and
denote hydrogen or C
1
-C
3
 alkyl groups and
n
represents an integer from 2 to 6.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the carbamate used is one such as corresponds to the

general formula given in claim 1, for which

R
1
represents hydrogen, a methyl group or the group
corresponding to the formula

2
represents hydrogen,
R
3
represents hydrogen or a methyl group, 
n
represents 2 or, in the case where R

 = H,
may also represent 3.
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that the carbamates are used in a quantity of from 0.1

to 6 wt.%, based on the weight of component B).
Process according to claims 1 to 3 for the preparation
of foamed plastics casings of steering wheels,

spoilers, and protective cushions in the interior of
an automobile.
Process according to claims 1 to 3 for the preparation
of soles of shoes and component parts of shoes by the

casting process or direct coating process.
