<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (2) comprising an insulative 
housing (12), a pair of inmoulded terminals (14) and a 

separate core support member (16), makes electrical 
contact with a twin core flexible conductor (4) comprising 

a flexible elastomeric outer tube (6) and flexible spaced 
apart inner conductors (8). The core support member (16) 

comprises a core section (42) substantially filling the 
inner space formed by the conductors (8) and tube (6) 

thereby providing support to the flexible tube conductor 
(4) such that pin sections (40) of the terminals (14) can 

be sandwiched between the conductor (8) and the core (42) 
and additionally sandwiching the flexible outer tube (6) 

and inner conductor (8) between strain relief projections 
(58) of the core members arms (54) and the inner core 

section (42) for securely fixing the connector thereto. 
The connector is of a cost-effective and simple 

construction that is also easy to assemble. A certain 
length of the twin core tube conductor (4) can be 

positioned along the top sill of an automobile window 
frame thereby providing a detection means for objects 

capture between the window and frame, whereby pressure 
against the flexible tube (4) causes the conductors (8) to 

enter into electrical contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector for
making electrical connection to spaced conductive cores
disposed within a flexible tube.The implementation of electrical motors to command
closure means such as automobile windows is now very wide
spread, these electrical devices requiring a safety
mechanism to prevent injury to persons caught during
closing thereof. Electrically operated windows of an
automobile often have no particular safety mechanism, the
safety being implicit in that the torque of the electrical
motor is sufficiently low to prevent serious injury. The
raising of the electrical window at a certain desired
speed however, requires a sufficiently powerful motor to
overcome the inertial and frictional forces. Under certain
circumstances, the force exerted by the closure means upon
closing may be dangerously high, in particular for young
children or weak persons.There is therefore a need to provide a means of
detecting an obstacle captured within an electrically
operated closure means such as an automobile window. One
such detection means designed for this very purpose,
comprises a flexible hollow tube having a pair of spaced
apart flexible conductors extending along the inner wall
of the tube. This tube would be placed proximate the upper
sill of the automobile window frame, whereby an obstacle
captured between the closing window and the window frame,
would compress the flexible tube thereby producing contact
between the flexible conductors therein. These conductors
would be electrically connected to the electrical motor
and contact therebetween would cause appropriate command
of the motor. In particular, this known tube includes
carbon conductors, which are difficult to provide an 
interconnection thereto as the carbon conductors can
neither be adequately crimped or soldered.In order to electrically interconnect the electrical
motor and the twin core conductor tube, an electrical
connector means that is safe and reliable must be devised.The object of this invention therefore, is to provide
a reliable electrical connector for making electrical
connection between a flexible twin core conductor tube and
electrical conducting wires.A further object of this invention, is to provide an
electrical connector for making connection to conductors
mounted in a flexible tube that is easily assembled and
cost-effective, yet reliable.The present invention consists in an electrical connector
as defined in claim 1. EP-A- 0 383 671 discloses
an electrical connector according to the preamble of claim
