<ABSTRACT>
An electronic control system for a stepless 
automatic gearbox (2) for motor vehicles comprises 

push-buttons (10, 12, 14) for selecting forward 
movement in low gears or in all gears, and reverse 

gear respectively. Reverse gear can only be selected 
if the vehicle speed is below a predetermined 

threshold; the gearbox is brought automatically to the 
parking position if the ignition switch (20) is in the 

open position and the vehicle speed is below a 
predetermined threshold.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic 
control system for a stepless automatic gearbox for 
motor vehicles, particularly motor cars. Whether the automatic gearbox is stepless or not, 
it is controlled by a lever which is normally disposed 
on the tunnel of the car and which the driver actuates 
to position the gearbox mechanism in the desired 
operating condition, moving the lever in suitable 
selector gates which usually bear the letters "L" 
(low) when a low gear is desired, "D" (drive), in 
which case the entire operating strategy is left to 
the automatic gearbox depending on the position of the 
accelerator pedal, "R" (reverse) to indicate reverse 
gear, and a position indicated "P" (park) which is 
selected when it is desired to park the car 
permanently. An arrangement as described above has certain 
disadvantages: firstly, the presence of the gear lever 
projecting from the tunnel of the car can impede the 
driver's movement towards the passenger side and the 
passenger's movement towards the driver's side; 
secondly, if the driver "fiddles", quite 
involuntarily, with the gear lever, he can cause  
 
undesired or even dangerous movements of the lever 
from one position to another, for example, sudden 
changes from the "drive" position to the "low" 
position or the direct passage from one of the forward gear 
positions to reverse gear, seriously damaging the 
entire transmission assembly. Furthermore, it is possible that the driver may 
park the car on a sloping road and leave it without 
moving the gear lever to the "park" position; under 
these circumstances, it is possible for the car to 
move down the slope, which is obviously extremely 
dangerous. The object of the present invention is to 
overcome the above disadvantages by virtue of an 
electronic system for controlling a stepless automatic 
gearbox for motor vehicles, particularly motor cars, 
having the characteristics mentioned specifically in 
the following claims. The invention will now be described, purely by 
way of non-limiting example, with reference to the 
appended drawing which shows the electronic system 
according to the invention in block form. With 
reference to this drawing, the automatic gearbox, for 
example of the stepless type, of a motor vehicle not 
illustrated is schematically indicated 2; an electronic 
control unit 4 is connected to an electric motor,  
 
for example, a stepper motor 6 connected to an encoder 
8 which is in turn connected to the central unit 4; 
the motor 6 can cause the gearbox
