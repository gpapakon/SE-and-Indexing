<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anilide derivatives, to processes for their preparation, 
to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to their medical use. In 
particular it relates to compounds and compositions which are capab!e of 
sensitizing multidrug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. In many patients, the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy is initially poor or 
decreases after initial treatment due to the development of resistance to 
anticancer drugs, known as multidrug-resistance. Multidrug-resistance is a 
process whereby malignant cells become resistant to structurally diverse 
chemotherapeutic agents following treatment with a single anti-tumour drug. 
This acquired drug resistance can be a major clinical obstacle in the treatment 
of cancer. Some tumours are intrinsically multidrug-resistant, and hence do not 
respond to chemotherapy. It has been shown that this type of resistance can be reversed by some calcium 
channel blockers such as nicardipine and verapamil, by antiarrhythmic agents 
such as amiodarone and quinidine, as well as by natural products such as 
cepharanthine. However, these compounds exert their multidrug resistant cell 
sensitizing activity only at very high doses, well above their intrinsic toxic level, 
and this severely limits their clinical use in the field of cancer chemotherapy. A novel group of compounds has now been found which can sensitize 
multidrug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents at dose levels at 
which these novel compounds show no toxicity. Thus, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I): 
  
 
and salts and solvates thereof, including physiologically acceptable salts and 
solvates thereof, in which: 
A represents an oxygen or a sulphur atom, a bond or a group (CH2)INR7 (where 
I represents zero or 1 and R7 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group); B represents a C1-4 alkylene chain optionally substituted by a hydroxyl group, 
except that the hydroxyl group and moiety A cannot be attached to the same 
carbon atom when A represents an oxygen or sulphur atom or a group 
(CH2)INR7, or when A represents a bond B may also represent a C2-4 
alkenylene chain; R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-4 alkyl group; m represents 1 or 2; R2 represents a hydrogen or a halogen atom, or a C1-4 alkyl, C1-4 alkoxy or 
C1-4 alkylthio group; R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-4 alkoxy group; R4 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 alkoxy group; R5 represents a hydrogen atom or R1 and R5 together form a group
