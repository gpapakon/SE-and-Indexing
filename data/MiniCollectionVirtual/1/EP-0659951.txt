<ABSTRACT>
In a wall made of hollow blocks with vertical cavities bounded by webs, long channels extending over a plurality of block courses are produced when thin-bed mortar is used. This reduces the heat insulation and sound insulation. If sheets are introduced between the block courses, the thin-bed mortar takes hold even in the region of the cavities, and the cavities of each block course are closed off.

<CLAIMS>
A wall made of hollow blocks (3, 4, 6, 7) set one on top of
the other with planed upper and lower surfaces (9, 10) and a

plurality of cavities (11) which are vertical when
assembled, said cavities being limited by webs (12), with

each stone layer (1,5) being laid in thin-bed mortar (14,
16), 
characterised in that
 there are also sheet-type
elements (15) provided in the thin-bed mortar (14, 16)

between the layer of stones (1, 5) closing each cavity (11)
at least partially.
A wall made of hollow blocks according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the sheet-type elements are sheets of
films or foils (15).
A wall made of hollow blocks according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the sheet-type elements are grids or
nets.
