<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power circuit for
providing an AC/DC conversion, and more particularly, to a
power circuit having an improved AC/DC conversion efficiency.A power circuit is available in a variety of applications
such as AC/DC converting circuits, DC/DC converting circuits,
etc., which have been developed taking conversion efficiency,
power efficiency, etc., into consideration according to such
applications. Switching regulator type power circuits are
mainly used for large power consumption devices, while series
path type power circuits are used for other devices requiring
a precision output voltage. Switching speeds and ripple
factors, etc. are taken into account in the case of the
switching regulator type power circuits. While losses in
circuit elements, transmission efficiencies, etc., are
examined in the case of the series path power circuits.
Effective powers of AC circuits are determined by phases
between voltages and currents and the performance relating
the phase is generally expressed as a power factor.FIGURE 1 shows a conventional power circuit.In FIGURE 1, an AC power source PS1 is connected to a
full-wave rectifier circuit DB1. The full-wave rectifier
circuit DB1 supplies its rectified output to a switching
regulator, i.e., the load circuit of the full-wave rectifier
circuit DB1 after a smoothing at a smoothing capacitor C5. 
This switching regulator includes a transformer T1 and a
switching transistor Q1. A starting circuit comprised of a
half-wave rectifier diode D1 and a capacitor C2 is also
connected to the switching regulator from the return line in
the single phase AC loop of the full-wave rectifier circuit
DB1 via a resistor R2.On the other hand, a DC power output VCC is supplied to a
voltage regulating circuit IC1 from a half-wave rectifier
circuit D2 coupled to a tertiary winding L4 of the
transformer T1 after smoothed at a smoothing capacitor C3.
The output of the voltage regulating circuit IC1 is supplied
to the base of the transistor Q1.The collector of the transistor Q1 is connected to one
end of the primary winding LP of the transformer T1 and then
the other end of the primary winding LP is connected to the
smoothing capacitor C5 and the rectifier circuit DB1.An AC voltage induced across secondary winding L2 of the
transformer T1 is rectified through a diode D3 and then the
rectified voltage from the diode D3 is output from the output
terminal 1 of the power circuit as a stabilized output after
smoothed at a capacitor C4 coupled between the cathode of the
diode
