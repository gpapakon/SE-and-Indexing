<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions for
polyolefin fibers having improved flame resistance and no
corrosive properties, as well as the fibers obtained from the
above mentioned compositions and the process for their
production.As used herein, "fibers" means not only filaments, among
which are staple and continuous filament fibers in particular,
but also products which are similar to fibers, such as fibrils,
monofilaments and raffia.It is known in the art that, in order to obtain the above
mentioned characteristics in the fibers, flame retardant
products, such as certain combinations of ammonium salts and
organic nitrogen compounds salts with antiacid substances, such
as oxides, stearates or silicates of alkali or alkaline-earth
metals, can be used.Complexes of organic compounds, used together with
monomeric free-radicals promoters, that can also be used in the
preparation of polyolefin fibers and fabrics, are described as
flame retardant additives in European patent 273458, in the
name of the Applicant. Said compounds consist of complexes of
bismuth and/or antimony halides with amines, and have the
following general formula:
R•(MeX3)y
wherein R is an amine selected from the group consisting of
dicyandiamide, guanamine, 2-guanidinoimidazole, melamine, 
isophoronediamine and piperazine, which are optionally
substituted with an alkyl, aryl or acyl group, and compounds
containing from 2 to 9 triazine rings either condensed or
bonded to one another with at least one -NH group; Me is
bismuth or antimonium; X is chlorine or bromine; y is a number
from 0.3 to 4.0.However, by using blends of said compounds in the
preparation of fibers, the problem presented by the corrosivity
property caused by the presence of halogenated flame-retardant
compounds in the blends cannot be overcome. Said corrosive
property, which is obviously undesirable, affects the iron
parts of the spinning machines and other apparatuses used in
the production of fibers, and those used in the production of
articles from said fibers.Moreover, the fibers obtained from said blends have
considerably low flame resistance values (i.e. oxygen indexes)
even when high concentrations of flame retardants are used.
This latter aspect obviously limits the use of the fibers
containing the above mentioned additives to applications where
high flame resistant properties are not required.A new olefin polymer composition has now been found that
can be converted into a fiber having good flame resistance and
no corrosive property. Said characteristics are
