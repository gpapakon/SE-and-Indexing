<ABSTRACT>
Method for removing hydrocarbon products from water 
surfaces which consists in putting said hydrocarbon 

products in contact with a polypropylene previously 
treated using a procedure which includes: 


(a) mixing a polypropylene with at least one silicon 
compound having a sterically hindered amine group 

in the molecule; 
(b) melting the above mixture at a temperature and for 
a time which is sufficient to form a single liquid 

phase; 
(c) cooling the mixture until a solid is formed which 
is then reduced into the desired physical form; 
(d) extracting the silicon compound from the above 
solid with a solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
removing hydrocarbon products from water surfaces. More specifically the present invention relates to 
a method for removing hydrocarbon products from water 
surfaces such as the sea, rivers, lakes, basins, etc. 
with the use of polypropylene. The pressing demand for petroleous products on the 
part of industrialized nations has made it necessary to 
transport considerable quantities of petroleum and its 
derivatives by sea. The use of effective means of security, although 
reducing the risks of environmental pollution, does not 
however exclude the possibility of accidental dispersions 
in the sea of more or less vast quantities of 
petroleous products. These dispersions can be extremely 
harmful to the environment in that the hydrocarbon 
substances, which are lighter than water, tend to 
spread over vast areas, forming a layer on the surface 
of the water which prevents the exchange of oxygen with  
 
the atmosphere, consequently jeopardizing marine life. 
In addition, the pollution may also effect the coasts 
causing serious damage both to the ecological equilibrium 
of the beaches, and to human activities carried 
out on the coasts (for example harbour traffic and 
tourism). The removal of hydrocarbon products dispersed in 
the water creates numerous difficulties, mainly due to 
the fact that the most volatile constituents evaporate 
whereas the heavier fractions tend to form a very 
viscous and sticky emulsion with the water, which is 
very difficult to recover with the conventional methods. To resolve this problem it has been suggested to 
use absorbent materials which, when put in contact with 
liquid hydrocarbons, are capable of absorbing them 
making them easily recuperable. The main characteristics which make an absorbent 
material suitable for this type of use are the following: 
great affinity with hydrocarbons and consequently 
high absorbing effect expressed as a quantity of 
oily substance absorbed per unit by weight of 
absorbent material; high surface development of the material to favour 
contact with the polluting product and consequently 
improve the absorbing effect;  
 low specific weight, to guarantee that the material 
floats on the surface of the water both 
before and after impregnation with the oily 
substances; low degree of stickiness and good consistency of 
the material once this has absorbed the oily 
product, to facilitate its recovery; low cost of absorbent material, to guarantee the 
economy of the method; possibility of
