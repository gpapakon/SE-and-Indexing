<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
electrostatically powder-coating an undercoating film which 
is formed on a metal surface, and more particularly, it 
relates to an electrostatic powder coating method which can 
improve the amount of transfer by electrostatic powder 
coating. In general, electrostatic coating of a metal surface is 
generally carried out by spraying a solvent type coating. 
While the metal surface may be directly electrostatically 
coated, an undercoating film is generally formed on the 
metal surface so that an overcoating layer is formed on this 
film by electrostatic coating, in order to improve corrosion 
resistance, smoothness and the like. However, employment of such a solvent type coating is 
unpreferable in consideration of sanitation and environmental 
conservation, due to volatilization of the solvent. To 
this end, electrostatic powder coating of electrostatically 
coating the target with a powder coating is studied. When an undercoating film which is formed on a metal 
surface is electrostatically coated with a powder coating,  
 
however, the transfer efficiency is extremely reduced as 
compared with a case of electrostatically coating the same 
with a solvent type coating. The transfer efficiency, which 
is not much reduced when the metal surface is directly 
coated with the powder coating, is extremely reduced when an 
undercoating film is formed on the metal surface and 
electrostatically coated with the powder coating. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
electrostatic powder coating method of electrostatically 
coating an undercoating film formed on a metal surface, 
which can improve the transfer efficiency. The electrostatic powder coating method according to 
the present invention comprises the steps of forming an 
undercoating film having a volume specific resistivity of 
not more than 10¹³ Ω·cm and a thickness of not more than 200 
µm on a metal surface, and forming an overcoating layer on 
the undercoating film by electrostatic powder coating. According to the present invention, it is not necessary 
to extremely reduce the volume specific resistivity of the 
undercoating film, which is not more than 10¹³ Ω·cm. In 
consideration of economy and practicality, the volume specific 
resistivity is preferably in the range of 10⁸ to 10¹³ Ω 
·cm. It is possible to reduce the volume specific resistivity  
 
of the undercoating film to not more than 10¹³ Ω·cm by a 
method of introducing conductive particles into the undercoating 
film. The
