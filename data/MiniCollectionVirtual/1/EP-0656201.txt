<ABSTRACT>
The composition is topically, or otherwise administered, to stimulate 
intracellular 
glutathione synthesis. Specifically, the composition may 
include glutathione esters; L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid; and 

esters of 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
treatments for preventing hair loss. More specifically, 
the present invention relates to methods for preventing 
hair loss and stimulating new hair growth. A variety of different factors can cause or be 
responsible for alopecia (baldness). For example, 
genetic factors, aging, or local or systemic disease can 
cause baldness. Such baldness can be partial or a 
complete loss of hair. See Merck Manual, 15th Edition, 
p. 2281. Alopecia can be due to male pattern baldness which 
is extremely common. Although male pattern baldness is 
familial and requires the presence of androgens, other 
etiologic factors that may be responsible are unknown. 
Female pattern baldness is also not infrequent in women. 
However, it is typically confined ordinarily to thinning 
of the hair; complete baldness in an area is rare. See 
Merck Manual, 15th Edition, p. 2281. Alopecia can also be due to toxic alopecia. A 
number of different stimuli can cause toxic alopecia. 
It can be caused by a febrile illness (e.g., scarlet 
fever). It can also be seen in myxedema, 
hypopituitarism, early syphilis, or following pregnancy. 
Furthermore, a number of agents are known to cause toxic 
alopecia, particularly, cytotoxic agents, thallium 
compounds, and overdoses of vitamin A or retinoids. No therapy is known for idiopathic male pattern 
baldness though transplants from hairy to bald areas are  
 
at times effective. Minoxidil, an antihypertensive 
medication, is currently being used topically in 
solutions of about 3%. Results vary, and the drug can 
be detected in the blood. When the drug is stopped, the 
new hair falls out. The long term value of Minoxidil and 
its dangers are unknown. See Merck Manual, 15th Edition, 
p. 2282. The present invention provides a method for 
preventing hair loss and stimulating new hair growth. 
Pursuant to the method, a patient suffering from hair 
loss and/or requiring new hair stimulation is provided 
with a therapeutically effective amount of a composition 
that includes an agent that acts as an intracellular 
cysteine source and stimulates intracellular glutathione 
synthesis. In an embodiment, the composition includes a 
cysteine source and glutathione stimulator chosen from 
the group consisting of: glutathione esters; L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic 
acid; and esters of 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic 
acid. The glutathione ester 
can be chosen from the group consisting of glutathione 
monoesters and glutathione diethyl esters. The composition can be

comprising the steps of administering to a patient who has at least 

experienced hair loss and requires new hair growth, a therapeutically 
effective amount of a composition that stimulates intracellular glutathione 

synthesis.

administering to a patient who is expected to experience toxic alopecia due 

to a toxic agent a therapeutically sufficient amount of a composition that 
stimulates the intracellular synthesis of glutathione. 
The method of Claim 12 wherein the toxic agent is a chemotherapy 
drug and the composition is administered prior to the administration of the 

chemotherapy drug.
