<ABSTRACT>
The lifting element consists of a parallelepipedal elastomeric block designed to be fixed to the inside wall of a mill containing milling members. At least part of its face (24) exposed to the milling members includes cells (26) to allow the milling members to embed therein. The mill includes a cylindrical hoop (10) with longitudinal rows of these lifting elements with elements arranged parallel to the generatrix of the hoop and elements which are inclined with respect to this generatrix.

Lifting element for a rotary mill consisting of
a parallelepipedal block of elastomer designed to be

fixed to the internal wall of a rotary grinder containing
grinding implements and to form part of the lining of the

latter, characterized in that at least a part of its face
(24) exposed to the grinding implements includes cavities

(26) to allow the grinding implements to be embedded
therein.
Lifting element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the face (24) including the said

cavities (26) is inclined with respect to the wall of the
mill, the thickness of the side of the attack zone,

viewed in the direction of rotation of the mill, being
less than on the opposite side (22).
Lifting element according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the said face (24) is domed when viewed in

a diametral section of the mill.
Rotary mill comprising a cylindrical shell (10)
with an internal lining (12) consisting of lifters (16)

and of lining plates (14), characterized in that the
lifting elements are elements according to any one of

Claims 1 to 3.
Mill according to Claim 4, characterized in that
the lifting elements (16) and the lining plates (14) are

arranged in alternating longitudinal rows (a, b).
Mill according to Claim 5, characterized in that
each row a of lifting elements includes, over at least

part of the length of the shell, straight elements (16a)
parallel to the generatrix of the shell and elements

(16b) which are inclined with respect to the generatrix
of the shell.
Mill according to Claim 6, characterized in that
each straight element (16a) is surrounded by two inclined

elements (16b) and vice-versa.
Mill according to any one of Claims 6 or 7,
characterized in that the straight elements (16a) and the

inclined elements (16b) have different radial
thicknesses. 
Mill according to any one of Claims 4 to 8,
characterized in that the thickness of the lining (12) is

constant over the entire length of the mill.
Mill according to any one of Claims 4 to 7,
characterized in that the thickness of the lining (12) is

higher at the outlet than at the inlet.
