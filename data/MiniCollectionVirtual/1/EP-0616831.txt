<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns electret-enhanced filter media (more simply
called "electret filters") made of fibers such as melt-blown microfibers. The
invention concerns fibrous electret filters for removing particulate matter from
air and improved fibers for making those filters. The invention is especially
concerned with respirators and the problem of improving the ability of filter
media to accept filtration-enhancing electrostatic charges and to sustain that
electret filtration enhancement in the presence of oily aerosols.For many years nonwoven fibrous filter webs have been made from
polypropylene using melt-blowing apparatus of the type described in Report No.
4364 of the Naval Research Laboratories, published May 25, 1954, entitled
"Manufacture of Super Fine Organic Fibers" by Van Wente et al. Such melt-blown
microfiber webs continue to be in widespread use for filtering particulate
contaminants, e.g., as face masks and as water filters, and for other purposes,
e.g., to remove oil from water.The filtering efficiency of a melt-blown microfiber web can be
improved by a factor of two or more when the melt-blown fibers are
bombarded as they issue from the orifices with electrically charged particles
such as electrons or ions, thus making the fibrous web an electret. Similarly,
the web can be made an electret by exposure to a corona after it is collected.
Melt-blown polypropylene microfibers are especially useful, while other
polymers may also be used such as polycarbonates and polyhalocarbons that
may be melt-blown and have appropriate volume-resistivities under expected
environmental conditions.Fibrous filters for removing particulate contaminants from the air are
also made from fibrillated polypropylene films. Electret filtration enhancement
can be provided by electrostatically charging the film before it is fibrillated. Common polymers such as polyesters, polycarbonates, etc. can be
treated to produce highly charged electrets but these charges are usually short-lived
especially under humid conditions. The electret structures may be films or
sheets which find applications as the electrostatic element in electro-acoustic
devices such as microphones, headphones and speakers and in dust particle
control, high voltage electrostatic generators, electrostatic recorders and other
applications.Fibrous polypropylene electret filters that are currently available,
some made from melt-blown polypropylene microfibers and others from
fibrillated polypropylene film, can show thermally stable electret filtration
enhancem
