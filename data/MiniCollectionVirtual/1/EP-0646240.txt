<ABSTRACT>
The aim of the invention is to provide a reliable permanent measuring process for monitoring the rise in temperature and dielectric stress in electrical machines which also includes the entire machine. In the present process there is a rotating machine (1) fitted with a closed cooling circuit. Downstream of the radiator (3), a small quantity of the coolant (4) is fed to the analyser (5). The coolant (4) is examined in the analyser (5) for the presence and quantity of cleavage or decomposition products of the insulation or coating paint and ozone and the data are fed into the evaluation unit (6) which evaluates the analysis data and data on the operating condition of the machine together. An output device (7) continuously records the thermal and dielectric stress on the machine (1). The process of the invention makes it possible for the first time continuously to monitor the thermal and dielectric stress in a rotating machine and covers the entire machine.

Process for evaluating the thermal and dielectric
condition of an electrical rotating machine or of an

electrical installation that comprises components made
of insulating materials or provided with coating

varnishes, the machine or the installation being
equipped with a closed cooling circuit and being

cooled by means of a gaseous cooling medium, the
gaseous cooling medium being permanently analysed

after the cooling medium has cooled down,

characterised in that
 the gaseous cleavage products
and decomposition products and ozone, which are

brought about by a thermal or dielectric stress of the
insulating materials or coating varnishes, are

determined and measured, and in that these analysis
values are evaluated and the instantaneous operating

condition of the machine (1) or of the installation is
ascertained, whereby the different degree of heating

for a different operating condition - such as an
operation at partial load, for instance - of the

machine or installation is taken into account, so that
a thermal overload can be detected, even though no

impermissible excess temperatures have yet been
attained.
Arrangement for implementing the process according to
Claim 1, characterised in that the cooling medium can

be drawn from the closed cooling circuit in accordance
with the process known as such, wherein the cooled

cooling medium (4) which [sic] downstream of a machine

cooler (3), which cools the heated cooling medium (2)
emerging from the machine (1) or installation, and can

be fed into a gas analyser (5), and in that the
analytical results and data about the instantaneous

operating condition of the machine (1) or installation
can be jointly fed into an evaluating instrument (6), 

and the evaluating instrument (6) is connected to an
output device (7).
