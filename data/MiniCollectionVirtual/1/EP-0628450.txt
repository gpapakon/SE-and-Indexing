<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle rear view mirror assembly comprises a 
mirror carrier (22) pivotally mounted on an intermediate member 

(20) which itself is pivotally mounted in a case (10). A 
main adjustment mechanism (18) adjusts the orientation 

of the intermediate member (20) relative to the mirror case 
(10) so as to position the mirror to provide a normal 

filed of view. An auxiliary adjustment mechanism (32,34) 
makes a variation to the orientation of the mirror carrier (22) 

relative to the intermediate member (20) so as to position 
the mirror to provide a second field of view, e.g. of 

the corresponding rear wheel of the vehicle. A drive 
mechanism (44) for the auxiliary adjustment mechanism (32,34) 

is mounted separately from both the intermediate member 
(20) and the mirror carrier (22), and is coupled to the auxiliary 

adjustment mechanism (32,34) by a flexible drive cable (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rear view mirror 
assembly of the type comprising a mirror case, a mirror 
pivotally mounted in the case for angular movement relative 
thereto, main adjustment means for adjusting the 
orientation of the mirror relative to the mirror case so as 
to position the mirror to provide a first field of view, 
and auxiliary adjustment means for making a variation to 
the orientation of the mirror so as to position it to 
provide a second field of view. A rear view mirror assembly of this type is 
described in EP-A-0463563. The main adjustment means 
comprises a pair of drive plungers pivotally coupled to the 
mirror and engaged in drive cylinders mounted on the base 
and the auxiliary adjustment means comprises means for 
varying the position of one of the drive cylinders relative 
to the base. This involves the use of a specially designed 
main adjustment mechanism. Another mirror assembly of the above type is 
disclosed in FR-A-2659051. The auxiliary adjustment means 
is arranged to vary the orientation of the main adjustment 
means within the mirror case. The auxiliary adjustment 
means therefore has to vary the position of a unit of 
substantially greater weight than that of the mirror alone, 
thereby increasing the risk that the mirror will be subject 
to unacceptable vibration when the vehicle on which it is 
mounted is in motion. According to the invention, in a rear view mirror 
assembly of the type described above, the main adjustment 
means is arranged to vary the orientation of an 
intermediate member relative to the mirror case and the 
auxiliary adjustment means is arranged to vary the 
orientation of the mirror relative to the intermediate 
member, drive means for the auxiliary adjustment means 
being mounted separately from both the intermediate member 
and the mirror, said drive means being coupled to the 
auxiliary adjustment means by a flexible drive cable. In one form of the invention, the drive means for  
 
the auxiliary adjustment means is mounted in the mirror 
case. Alternatively, if there is insufficient room in the 
mirror case, such drive means may be mounted within the 
vehicle body. In either case, the drive means does not 
contribute to the weight supported by the pivotal 
mountings of the intermediate member and the mirror and 
consequently does not increase the liability of the mirror 
to vibration. Embodiments of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:
