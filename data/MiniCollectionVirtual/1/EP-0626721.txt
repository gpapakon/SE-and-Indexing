<ABSTRACT>
2.1 A very simple method is described for forming a surface profile (13) in the surface (10) of a substrate (1), which method can be used versatilely and renders possible surface profiles of particularly high accuracy which can be very well reproduced. 2.2 For this purpose, a mask (2) having a mask edge (20) is provided at a distance (d) above the surface (10), the surface (10) is irradiated with an etching ion beam (3) and, during the irradiation, the surface (10) is rotated about a rotational axis (4), arranged diagonally at an angle ( alpha ) to the direction (30) of the ion beam (3), which rotational axis (4) is normal to the surface (10), the beam (3) striking the mask edge (20) during the rotation. By altering the angle ( alpha ), arbitrarily predetermined surface profiles can be formed. 2.3 Application in the production of layer tapers in semiconductor material.
