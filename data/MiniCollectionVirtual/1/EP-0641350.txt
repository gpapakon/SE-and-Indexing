<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR MAKING 2-FLUQRQ-2- DEOXYΠLΓTCOSERarVgrrmnri of f.he InventionThe present invention relates to a method for making 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose or [18F]2FDG , utilizing an anion exchange resin. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use of an anion exchange resin to more effectively trap [18F] fluoride ion, involving the treatment of the anion exchange resin having an anion, such as a carbonate or bicarbonate anion, with an aqueous solution of [18F] fluoride ion target water and an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate salt, such as sodium bicarbonate. Prior to the present invention, various procedures were used for making [18F]2FDG, which is used as a radiopharmaceutical for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) . Considerable effort has been expended in the development and refinement of such procedures. Because [18F]fluoride ion has a low decay energy, (0.64 MEV) , it allows the highest inherent resolution during PET measurements and has a relatively convenient half life of 109.7 min. The following equation illustrates the preferred procedure for making [18F]2FDG starting tiwh a solution of1,3,4, 6-tetra-0-acetyl-2-0-trifluoromethanesulfonyl-β-D-mannopyranose or "triflate": 
where Ac is acetate, and "PTR" means phase-transfer reagent.One method of synthesizing [18F]2FDG by the above procedure is shown by Hamacher et al.. Journal of Nuclear Medicine, 27:235-238, (1986) . Hamacher et al. employ an aminopolyether [Kryptofix 222 or K222]- potassium carbonate complex as a phase-transfer catalyst for [18F] fluoride. An additional procedure for making [18F]2FDG is shown by Brodack et al.. Applied Radiation and Isotope, Volume 39, No. 7, pages 699-703 (1988) involving the employment of a tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as a phase-transfer catalyst in place of the aminopolyether potassium complex of Hamacher et al. Although Brodack et al . disclose that the triflate reacts with [18F]fluoride ion using the tetrabutylammonium counter ion, a yield of 12-17% is reported which is significantly below the level considered acceptable for commercial robotic production of [18F]2FDG.The"above procedures utilizing a phase- transfer reagent for [18F]2FDG synthesis have an inherent disadvantage particularly if Kryptofix 222 is 

used as the phase-transfer catalyst. Kryptofix is toxic and minor traces of the phase-transfer catalyst are often difficult to remove from the final patient dose. Elaborate methods have to be used therefore to eliminate any traces of the phase-transfer catalyst before it is used.
