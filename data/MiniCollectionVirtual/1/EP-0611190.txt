<ABSTRACT>
Front brake lever (1) mounted with articulation about a spindle (2) carried by a fixed support (3) covered with a sound insulator. The base (6) of the lever has a border (9) for bearing on a surface (7) located at the periphery of the mounting slit (8) carried by the support (3), for preventing the propagation of acoustic waves into the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle in the position in which the brake is released.

<CLAIMS>
Hand brake lever (1) mounted in an articulated manner about an 
axle (2) carried by a fixed support (3) covered by a phonic insulator, 

characterised by the fact that the base (6) of the lever has a 
supporting rim (9) with a sealing surface (7) situated on the 

periphery of the mounting slot (8) in the support (3) for the purpose 
of avoiding the generation of acoustic waves in the compartment of 

an automotive vehicle when the brake is released. 
Hand brake lever (1) according to claim 1, characterised by the fact 
that the sealing surface (7) has a rectangular configuration and 

surrounds the mounting slot (8) of the hand brake lever. 
Hand brake lever according to claim 1, characterised by the fact 
that the sealing rim (9) has elastic properties.
