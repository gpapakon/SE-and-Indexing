<ABSTRACT>
Process for production of monohydrate alumina (boehmite) with precipitation from supersaturated sodium aluminate solutions starting at temperatures lower than 100  DEG C. The current invention is referred to a new aluminium precipitation process from supersaturated sodium aluminate solutions at temperatures lower than 100  DEG C in which aluminium is precipitated with the form of monohydrate alumina (boehmite, Al2O3.H2O). The process for production of monohydrate alumina (boehmite, Al2O3.H2O), from supersaturated sodium aluminate solutions, is characterised by precipitation at temperatures lower than 100  DEG C. The process comprises a highly innovative variation of the precipitation step in the current Bayer process in which it is achieved 40 % energy reduction in the calcination stage and more than 10 % total energy savings in the Bayer process.

<DESCRIPTION>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCΗON OF MONOHYDRATE ALUMINA FROM SUPERSATURATED ALUMINATE SOLUTIONSThe current invention is referred to a new aluminium precipitation process from supersaturated aluminate solutions at temperatures lower than 100°C in which aluminium is precipitated with the form of monohydrate alumina (Al2O3.H2O).Bayer process is used almost exclusively for the extraction of alumina from bauxites. The essential steps of the Bayer process are:• Digestion of bauxite by using sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures and pressures in autoclaves.Al(OH)3(s) + NaOH(aq) = NaAl(OH)4(„q)• Precipitation of aluminum hydroxide (gibbsite, AJ O3.3H2O) from the pregnant liquor according to the following equation. Precipitation is effected by cooling the solution to 55 - 60°C, thus causing supersaturation, and by introducing small gibbsite particles as seeds.2Al(OH)4 (1) = Al2O3.3H2O(5) + 2OH-(aq)• Calcination of gibbsite at about 1000- 1200°C to produce smelter-grade alumina according to the following equation:Al2O3.3H2O(.) = Al2θ3(s, + 3H2OEnergy cost of the Bayer process constitute about 30% of the alumina price. Total energy requirements in modern alumina plants amounts to about 12 GJ/t of alumina produced. 3 GJ/t Al O? of this, representing 25% of the total energy consumption, is used for calcination.The new process, which is analytically described in the current invention, is a highly innovative 

variation of the Bayer process whereby, at the precipitation step, alumina monohydrate (Al2O3 H2O) rather than tπhydrate is precipitated at atmospheric conditions The mam feature of this method is the production of a material needed substantially lower amounts of energy during the calcination stage The technical characteristics of the new process are the following• Precipitation of the monohydrate alumina (Boehmite) from supersaturated aluminate solutions is carried out at temperatures lower than 100°C, namely under atmospheric conditions• Precipitation of the monohydrate alumina (Boehmite) from supersaturated aluminate solutions is carried out with cooling, starting the procedure at temperatures close to but lower than 100°C• In a process variation, precipitation of the monohydrate alumina (Boehmite) from supersaturated aluminate solutions is carried out with cooling, starting the procedure at temperatures close to but lower than 100°C and with simultaneous use of ultrasounds with frequency varied, typically but not exclusively, in the region 20-50kHz• Alumina concentration in supersaturated aluminate solution is
