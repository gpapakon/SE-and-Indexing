<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the invention to specify a way which makes it possible to comply with the wish for a cheaper connector pin (12) for optical fibres (optical waveguides) (3). This is achieved by means of a connector (1) and a coupling housing (2) for optical-fibre cables (3), in which the connector (1), which consists of a connector pin (12) and a connector housing (11), is made up, as at least part of the sleeve (22) of the coupling housing (21), of ceramic such as, for example, zirconium oxide or aluminium oxide. The connector housing (11) is provided with a fitting peg (13) which engages into an axial fitting hole (14) in the connector pin (12). The connector housing (11) and the connector pin (12) have bores (14b, 16), aligned precisely with respect to each other in terms of axis, for an optical fibre (optical waveguide fibre) (3). As a result of the fact that it is possible for the ceramic part of the connector pin (12) to be shortened by a considerable part of its length without impairing the mechanical strength, the costs can be lowered to quite a considerable extent.
