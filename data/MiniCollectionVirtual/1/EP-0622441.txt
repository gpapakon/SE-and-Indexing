<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ferroelectric 
liquid crystal mixture and a liquid crystal device 
using the same. Liquid crystal display devices which have 
been most widely used in recent years employ a nematic 
phase of liquid crystal. In twisted nematic (TN) 
liquid crystal display devices, it is difficult to 
realize a display with a large capacity, e.g., 2000 x 
2000 lines, since contrast decreases with the increase 
in the number of lines. In order to improve the TN 
liquid crystal display devices, supertwisted nematic 
(STN) liquid crystal display devices and double layer 
supertwisted nematic (DSTN) liquid crystal display 
devices have been developed. However, in these devices, 
contrast decreases and response time becomes longer 
with the increase in the number of lines; therefore, 
display capacity is now limited to about 800 x 1024 
lines. Active matrix type liquid crystal display 
devices have been developed to realize a display with a 
large capacity, e.g., 1000 x 1000 lines. These devices 
also have disadvantages such as many steps for prolonged 
production, a decrease in yield, and high production 
cost. In recent years, in addition to liquid crystal 
display devices employing a nematic phase, those  
 
employing a smectic phase have been extensively studied. 
In particular, a ferroelectric liquid crystal 
display device has been considered to be promising 
(N. A. Clark et al., Appl. Phys. Lett., 36, 899 
(1980)). The ferroelectric liquid crystal display 
device employs a memory property of a chiral smectic C 
phase, a chiral smectic I phase, and the like. Because 
of this, the ferroelectric liquid crystal display 
device enables a display with a large capacity accompanied 
by the decrease in response time. In addition, 
since the ferroelectric liquid crystal display device 
does not require an active element such as a thin film 
transistor, production cost is not likely to increase. 
Furthermore, the ferroelectric liquid crystal display 
device has an advantage of a large viewing angle, so 
that it has been promising as a display device with a 
large capacity, e.g., 2000 x 2000 lines. There are various problems to be solved for 
putting the ferroelectric liquid crystal display device 
into practical use. Among them, it is most important 
to find a means for realizing high contrast in a simple 
matrix drive. Regarding this problem, the following 
methods have been proposed. 
(1) A method for using oblique vacuum evaporation (2) A method for using a high pretilt alignment film (3) A
