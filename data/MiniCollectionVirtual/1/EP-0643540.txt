<ABSTRACT>
An automatic phase control apparatus for controlling 
the frequency of a sine wave produced from a variable 

frequency oscillator (6) to be equal to that of the carrier 
wave of the extracted chrominance signal. A phase difference 

detector 4 detects a phase difference between the sine wave 
and the carrier wave. The detected phase difference is 

integrated to obtain an integrated value which is applied to 
the frequency oscillator for determining the oscillation 

frequency. A deviation detector (9; 10) is provided for 
detecting a deviation of the integrated value with respect to 

an expected frequency control data calculated by a calculator 
(8). When the deviation is greater than a predetermined 

range, the integrated value is replaced with the calculated 
data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic phase
control apparatus used for chrominance signal frequency
conversion processing in a consumer video cassette recorder
(VCR) having a color video signal reproduction function.Chrominance signal processing in consumer VCRs
frequency converts the chrominance signal to a low band signal
for recording, and then frequency converts the chrominance
signal again during reproduction. The carrier frequency of
the low-band converted chrominance signal in VHS-format VCRs
is forty times the horizontal scanning frequency in the NTSC
system, and 40.125 times the horizontal scanning frequency in
the PAL system. Reproduction processing of the low-band
converted chrominance signal is executed by an automatic phase
control loop ("APC loop" below) generating an oscillation
signal of which the frequency and phase are synchronized to
the carrier wave of the reproduced low-band converted
chrominance signal. One known problem with this APC loop is
called "side lock," a phenomenon in which, because the burst
signal is an intermittent signal, the APC loop locks even
though the APC loop is a frequency that differs by an integer
multiple of the horizontal scanning frequency from the carrier 
frequency of the reproduced low-band converted chrominance
signal.A conventional automatic phase control apparatus is
disclosed in Japanese patent laid-open publication number 3-65893,
published May 20, 1991. In this apparatus, the
continuous wave of the variable frequency oscillator in the
APC loop is phase-compared with the continuous wave of the
carrier wave in the reproduced low-band converted chrominance
signal obtained from the automatic frequency control loop
("AFC loop" below) to detect whether the APC loop has side
locked, and if so whether the oscillation frequency of the
variable frequency oscillator has side locked on the high
frequency side relative to the carrier frequency of the
reproduced low-band converted chrominance signal, or on the
low frequency side. An "increase frequency" or "decrease
frequency" signal is then input to the variable frequency
oscillator to correct the APC loop from the side locked
frequency to the correct frequency synchronization state.The above method, however, requires an AFC loop
circuit for side lock detection, thus increasing the
complexity of the circuitry. The side lock correction circuit
further comprises a loop consisting of a variable frequency
oscillator, phase comparator, and frequency asynchronous
detector, and further processing time is
