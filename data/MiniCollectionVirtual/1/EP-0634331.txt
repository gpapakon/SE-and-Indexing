<ABSTRACT>
A packaging element and a method for producing it are proposed as a particularly simple, space-saving and easily disposable packaging for flat articles. The packaging element consists of a supporting part with a supporting surface (3) for an article and has side parts (6, 7, 8, 9), all of the same material, which are connected to the supporting part by means of a bridge (12) of the same material and which are folded back onto the supporting surface in such a way that the supporting surface, together with the side parts, encloses a space for the article.
