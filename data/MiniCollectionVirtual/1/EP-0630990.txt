<ABSTRACT>
A method of limiting sticking of a body (38, substrate) to 
a susceptor (18) after the body (38) has been coated with a 

layer in a deposition chamber (12) by plasma chemical vapor 
deposition includes subjecting the coated body (38) to a 

plasma of an inactive gas, e.g., hydrogen, nitrogen, argon 
or ammonia, which does not adversely affect the coating and 

does not add additional layers to the body (38). After the 
coated body (38) is subjected to the plasma of the inactive 

gas, the body (38) is separated from the susceptor (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method of
improving the lifting of a body off a susceptor in a plasma
processing (deposition) apparatus, and, more particularly,
to a method of limiting sticking of a body to the susceptor
in a plasma deposition apparatus to permit ease of lift-off
of the body from the susceptor.Plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a process
used for the deposition of layers of various materials on a
body, particularly in the manufacture of semiconductor
devices and the like formed on an insulating body, such as
glass or a semiconductor wafer. A plasma CVD apparatus
comprises, in general, a deposition chamber, a pair of
spaced electrodes with at least one of the electrodes being
in the deposition chamber, and a susceptor in the deposition
chamber and between the electrodes for supporting the body
to be coated. The susceptor may also serve as one of the
electrodes. Means are provided to achieve a flow of a
deposition gas into the deposition chamber, and a power
source is connected to the electrodes for providing a
sufficient amount of radio frequency (rf) power to create a
plasma in the deposition gas. For commercial production,
plasma CVD apparatus also typically comprises means for
automatically transferring the bodies being coated into the
deposition chamber and onto the susceptor and for removing 
the coated bodies from the susceptor and the deposition
chamber. The transfer means generally includes fingers for
lifting the coated bodies from the susceptor. Also, the
susceptor generally moves vertically upwardly to receive a
body to be coated and then vertically downwardly as the
fingers lift the coated body therefrom.A problem which has been discovered in the operation of
a plasma CVD apparatus is that the bodies have a tendency to
stick to the susceptor. It is believed that this sticking
is the result of an electrostatic charge which attaches to
the body and the susceptor during the plasma deposition
process. This makes it more difficult to remove the coated
bodies from the susceptor without damaging the bodies. In
fact, the sticking has caused the bodies to break as they
are lifted off of the susceptor.The present invention is directed to a method of
limiting sticking of a body to a susceptor as a result of
processing a surface of the body by plasma chemical vapor
processing. During the processing, the body is mounted on
the susceptor in a processing chamber and is processed, such
as by applying a coating to the body. The method of the
present invention comprises, after

<CLAIMS>
A method of limiting sticking of a body (38) to a
susceptor (18) resulting from processing of a surface of

the body (38) by plasma processing while the body (38) is
mounted on the susceptor (18) in a processing chamber, the

method comprising the step of:

after the body (38) is processed, subjecting the body
(38) to a plasma of a gas which does not chemically react

with the processed surface on the body and which does not
deposit a layer on the body.
The method of claim 1,

further comprising the step of separating the body (38)
from the susceptor (18) after the body (38) is subjected to

the plasma of the gas.
The method of claim 2,

in which the gas is selected from the group consisting of
hydrogen, nitrogen, argon and ammonia.
The method of claim 3,

in which the plasma of the gas is formed by subjecting the
gas to an rf power of between 0.03 and 0.14 watts/cm
2
 times 
the area of an electrode (16) spaced from the susceptor

(18) and to which a voltage is applied to form the plasma.
The method of claim 4,

in which a pressure is provided in the deposition chamber
(12) which is between 26.7 and 466.6 Pa (0.2 and 3.5 Torr).
The method of claim 5,

in which the body (38) is subjected to the plasma of the
gas for a period of between about 2 and 15 seconds.
The method of claim 6,

further comprising continuing to subject the body (38) to
the plasma of the gas while the body (38) is being

separated from the susceptor (18).
The method of any of the preceding claims,

wherein the body (38) is processed by subjecting it to a
plasma of a processing gas.
The method of claim 8,

wherein an essentially continuous plasma is maintained when
the processing gas is changed to the gas.
A method of treating a body comprising the steps of:

placing the body (38) on a susceptor (18) within a
deposition chamber (12) having an electrode (16) spaced

from the susceptor (18);
flowing a deposition gas within the chamber (12);
applying a voltage across the electrode (16) and the
susceptor (18) at a rf power which generates a plasma in

the deposition gas so as to react the deposition gas and
deposit a layer on a surface of the body (38);
discontinuing the flow of the deposition gas;
flowing a second gas into the chamber (12) which
second gas does not react with the layer on the body (38)

or the body (38) and does not add another layer; 
applying a rf power to the second gas to generate a
plasma of the second gas which is applied to the body (38);

and then
separating the body (38) from the susceptor (18).
The method of claim 10,

in which the second gas is selected from the group
consisting of hydrogen, nitrogen, argon and ammonia.
The method of claim 11,

in which the plasma in the second gas is formed at a power
less than that used to form the plasma of the deposition

gas.

in which the second gas is subjected to an rf power of
between 0.03 and 0.14 watts/cm
2
 times the area of the
electrode (16) to which the voltage is applied to form the

plasma.

continuously as the gas is changed from the deposition gas

to the second gas.
The method of claim 10,

wherein the plasma is maintained essentially continuously
when the deposition gas is changed to the second gas.
