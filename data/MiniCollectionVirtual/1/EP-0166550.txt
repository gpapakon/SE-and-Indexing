<ABSTRACT>
A non-invasive optical coupling device comprises means 
to hold an optical fibre while bending it with a radius of curva­

ture sufficiently small so cause light to leak through the clad­
ding, and means to hold a tap fibre in a predetermined position 

to receive at least a portion of the light leaking from the main 
fibre. This device enables light sources, sensors and various 

other optical communications devices to be connected via tap 
fibres to ring main fibres and data buses, without degradation 

of the fibres to which the tap fibres are connected.
