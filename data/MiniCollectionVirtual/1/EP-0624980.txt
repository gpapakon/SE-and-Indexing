<ABSTRACT>
Transmitter station for transmitting, and receiver for receiving a plurality 
of television programs 
via
 respective transmission channels. A teletext page with tuning 
data which are representative of the transmission channels used by the transmitter 

station is transmitted by means of one of the programs, for example a local television 
program. An installation procedure of downloading the tuning data comprises the search 

of the local television program. In order to accelerate the procedure, the page header of 
its teletext pages includes a code (∼) indicating that the tuning data are incorporated in 

said television program.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transmitter station for transmitting a plurality of
television programs via respective transmission channels, comprising a data generator
adapted to transmit tuning data in the television signal of one of the television programs
at a given repetition frequency, which tuning data are representative of the transmission
channels used by the transmitter station. The invention also relates to a television
receiver for receiving television signals from such a transmitter station.Generally, television receivers are tuned to a desired program by means
of preset keys, also referred to as program numbers or preset numbers. A tuning
memory in the receiver comprises a tuning data for each preset number in the form of
the transmitter frequency or channel number, by means of which the receiver is tuned to
the corresponding transmission channel. When the receiver is used for the first time, the
tuning memory is to be programmed in a procedure referred to as installation
procedure. However, also when the installation procedure in a receiver has already been
carried out, it may be desirable to modify allocated preset numbers, for example when a
new television program is introduced.Various embodiments of the installation procedure are known. An
attractive embodiment is described in European Patent Application EP 0 263 555. This
procedure is notably applicable in cable television systems in which the cable network
manager takes care of the distribution of television programs. As described in this
Patent Application, the cable television transmitter station transmits, simultaneously with
at least one of the television programs, a teletext page in which the tuning data of the
available programs and corresponding preset numbers are stated. The relevant teletext
page has a standardized page number, for example a hexadecimal page number outside
the conventional range of 100-899. The installation procedure now comprises the
selection of this page and the storage of the tuning data which it incorporates in the 
tuning memory. Subsequently, all receivable programs can be called by means of the
preset number determined by the manager. Generally, this number will satisfy the user's
wishes.The teletext page with tuning data is preferably transmitted with the
television signal of a local television program generated by the cable network manager.
Practically all cable networks transmit such a program in the form of a cable
newspaper, a mosaic image or the like. However, it is not known in advance at which

A transmitter station for transmitting a plurality of television programs 
via

respective transmission channels, comprising a data generator (52) adapted to transmit
tuning data in the television signal of one of the television programs at a given

repetition frequency, which tuning data are representative of the transmission channels
used by the transmitter station, characterized in that the generator (52) is further

adapted to transmit a code (∼) in said television signal at a higher repetition frequency,
than that at which the tuning data is transmitted, said code indicating that the tuning

data are incorporated in the television signal.
A transmitter station as claimed in Claim 1, in which the tuning data are
incorporated in a predetermined teletext page, characterized in that the code is included

in the page header of the teletext pages of which the page with tuning data forms part.
A transmitter station as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the code
is included in a character position of the page header to be displayed as a space and is

constituted by a control code for switching the teletext display mode.
A receiver of television programs transmitted by a transmitter station as
claimed in Claim 1, which receiver comprises:


a tuner (7) for tuning to transmission channels through which the television
programs are transmitted,
a decoder (14) for receiving and storing data incorporated in television signals,
a tuning memory (17) for storing tuning data at respective memory locations,
a control circuit (15) coupled to said tuner, decoder and tuning memory and
adapted to receive the transmitted tuning data and store them in the tuning

memory,

characterized in that the control circuit is further adapted to detect (64) the code upon
reception of a television signal, which code indicates that the tuning data are

incorporated in said television signal, and to wait (66) for the reception of the tuning
data upon reception of the code.
A receiver as claimed in Claim 4, which is arranged to receive the tuning 
data in the form of a teletext page, characterized in that the control circuit is adapted to

select (63) a predetermined teletext page, and, while waiting for its reception, to detect
whether the code is included (64) in the page header of teletext pages.
A receiver as claimed in Claim 4 or 5, in which the control circuit is
adapted to tune (61) the tuner to a further transmission channel when there is no

detection of the code in the television signal of a channel within a predetermined time

(65).
