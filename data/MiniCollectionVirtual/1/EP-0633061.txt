<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for continuous polymerization. More particularly, 
it relates to a continuous polymerization method using a 
tubular continuous polymerization apparatus, in which the 
washing of a polymerization tube can be eliminated, the time-loss 
when the raw materials of polymerization are changed can be 
reduced and prevention of scale production inside of the 
polymerization tube becomes possible, and which is related to 
a continuous polymerization apparatus which can be used in the 
method. Heretofore, as a method for polymerization of 
polymeric monomers, the batch polymerization method in which a 
polymerization reactor equipped with a stirrer, a condenser 
and so on is used has been widely employed in industry. On the other hand, even though the continuous 
polymerization method in which a tubular polymerization 
apparatus is used has been known to have relatively high 
productivity, this method still has some problems to be 
solved, for example, (1) it has been difficult to wash or 
clean the polymerization tube when raw materials (hereinafter, 
sometimes referred to as "species") are changed, (2) the loss 
in raw materials and time generated by the restoration of the 
solution in the tube to its steady state when species is 
changed is unavoidable, and (3) particularly in continuous 
emulsion polymerization, scale is usually produced on the  
 
inner wall of the polymerization tube during polymerization 
and, if accumulated, this scale causes trouble in operation. 
Therefore, the continuous polymerization method, in fact, is 
limited in its practical use to only the production of those 
polymers that barely adhere to the inside of the 
polymerization tube or to a process in which the 
polymerization tube can be washed easily using solvents or 
detergents. The present invention aims to provide a 
continuous polymerization method using a tubular continuous 
polymerization apparatus, in which (1) the washing or cleaning 
of a polymerization tube can be eliminated, (2) loss in time and 
raw materials of polymerization caused by the restoration of 
the solution inside the tube to its steady state when the 
species is changed can be reduced and (3) prevention of scale 
production particularly in the case where scale is produced in 
a relatively large amount on the inner wall of the 
polymerization tube such as in continuous emulsion 
polymerization becomes possible, and to provide a continuous 
polymerization apparatus which can be used in the method. The
