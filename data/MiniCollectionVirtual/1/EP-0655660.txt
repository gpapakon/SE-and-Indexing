<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus using electrophotographic process such as a photocopier, a printer and the like.In image forming apparatuses using so called electrophotographic process (Carlson process), corona charging devices that utilize the corona discharge phenomenon have been used as typical means for charging an electrophotographic photoconductor at a desired potential level. This method, however, requires a high voltage for causing discharge, which would give electric noises to various peripheral apparatuses. Alternatively, a large quantity of ozone gas that will be generated in discharging would give an unpleasant feeling to people around the machine. To deal with these problems, as alternatives to corona discharging devices, a method has been proposed in which a photoconductor is charged by applying a voltage between the photoconductor and a conductive resin roller or conductive fibers. Nevertheless, this method suffers from another problem. That is, in a case of a conductive resin roller being used, if a micro-area of a photoreceptive layer of the photoconductor to be charged was peeled off and therefore part of a conductive substrate such as aluminum, etc., is exposed, electric current from the roller would converge into the exposed portion, to thereby cause striped charging unevenness extending across the photoconductor in its axial direction. Meanwhile, brush type charging devices using conductive fibers can be roughly classified into two kinds, one of which has fibers planted on a belt-like strip and the other of which has fibers planted on a roller. Either of these could eliminate striped charging unevenness which would arise when the aforementioned conductive resin roller was used.Nevertheless, when the belt-like brush charging device is used with being fixed, another kind of image defect arises. Specifically, brushing stripes which run in the advancing direction of sheets arise on the image. This is because that each position across the longitudinal direction of the charged member or photoconductor always comes into contract with the same part of fibers on the charging brush. That is, if some parts of fibers have less charging ability than other parts, the portion of the charged member contacting with the part of fibers having less charging ability will always be charged at a lower surface potential while the portion contacting with the part of fibers having higher charging ability will always be charged at a higher surface potential. This causes charging
