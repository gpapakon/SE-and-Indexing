<ABSTRACT>
Digital image data containing binary pixel values are reproduced, without any loss of detail, by a reproduction unit, such as a laser printer, having a lower base resolution than the resolution of the image data, by subjecting the image data to a resolution conversion, the resolution being reduced in one direction (to a value corresponding to the resolution of the reproduction unit) and enlarged in the other direction. Use is made of the fact that in many reproduction units the resolution can be increased in one direction by increasing the control frequency. The resolution conversion is carried out by means of direct one-to-one transfer of pixel values from the original pixels to the new pixels or by means of a table containing a pattern of reproduction pixels for each pattern of original pixels. The patterns of reproduction pixels in the table are so selected that on reproduction thereof flattening occurs in the reproduction system. This gives an apparently increased reproduction resolution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for and method of reproducing an image on the 
basis of digital image data which describe the image in the form of a raster of binary 
pixels. Devices of this kind are generally known. They are provided with inputting means 
for receiving the digital image data and with a reproduction unit which displays the 
pixels in their mutual relationship on a reproduction medium, such as a sheet of paper or 
a video display unit. The pixels in such cases are reproduced in one of two possible 
forms, e.g. white or black. Problems arise with this reproduction if the boundaries of white and black image 
parts do not exactly agree with the separating lines between the pixels, because a pixel 
can only be reproduced in one form at a time. The boundaries between white and black 
image parts are thus imaged on the reproduction medium at the separating lines 
between the pixels. One effect of this is that boundary lines parallel to these separating 
lines are often shifted somewhat while on the other hand separating lines which extend 
at an angle over the image are reproduced as a stepped line. The skilled addressee 
knows this effect as "aliasing". In many reproduction units the pixels have dimensions such that they can be 
distinguished separately. As a result, the above-described deviations are visible on the 
reproduction medium and result in reduced reproduction quality. An obvious step in order to improve reproduction quality in this respect is to 
increase the resolution of the pixel raster. Smaller pixels are less readily distinguished 
and as a result the aliasing effect is also reduced. Although the number of pixels, and 
hence the number of processing operations, increases as a result with the square of the 
resolution increase, developments in electronics lead to ever increasing processing 
speeds, so that the processing time can be kept within acceptable limits. A disadvantage of this solution, however, is that a reproduction unit having a higher 
resolution is much more complex and expensive than a normal reproduction unit. 
However, this applies mainly in one direction. A reproduction image is built up of a 
raster of pixels which are displayed in successive (horizontal) lines. A laser printer, for 
example, contains a photoconductive medium which is charged and then exposed in 
successive lines by a beam of light modulated in accordance with the pixel values in the 
image data. Changing the distance between the lines is a far-reaching operation in the 
system and hence
