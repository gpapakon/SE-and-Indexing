<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for transferring individual articles (M) in 
sheet form and placing them in stacks (P1, P2) of pre-determined 

numbers includes a conveyor (17, 23) which picks up the articles 
from a delivery system (11) by gripping them along their edges. 

Along said conveyor at least two reciprocating expellers (27, 29) 
disposed in series remove said articles from the conveyor and lay 

them down onto a stacker means (31, 35; 33, 37). Each expeller 
(27, 29) operates with continuous, reciprocating motion at all 

times. The expeller (27) which is closest to the delivery system 
(11) may selectively be moved, in the direction of its 

reciprocating motion, so as to take a position (27X, 27Y) in the 
trajectory of the manufactured articles fed by said conveyor 

means, and, alternately, a position (27X', 27Y'), in which it is 
not in the article-feeding trajectory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an apparatus for transferring 
individual articles in sheet form and placing them in stacks of 
pre-determined numbers. It includes a conveyor which picks up 
said articles from a delivery system by gripping them along their 
edges. Along said conveyor, at least two reciprocating expellers 
remove said articles from the conveyor means and lay them down 
onto a stacker. The expellers are disposed in succession in the 
direction of advancement of said conveyor and caused to work 
alternately whereby, at selected times, the article fed to the 
expeller which is furthest away from the delivery system passes 
the temporarily inoperative expeller which lies closer to the 
delivery system. In the production of paper napkins, especially the type 
double-folded along two folding lines perpendicular to the sides 
of the manufactured article, machines are well-known in the art 
wherein a web of paper material is longitudinally slit into 
strips which are then fed to transverse cutting and folding 
units. The finished article is withdrawn by a takeout cylinder, 
on which it has been folded, by a belt system which then conveys 
it to the expeller or extractor having reciprocating means to 
remove each individual folded article from the conveyor and lays 
it down where it becomes a part of a stack of articles. The 
expeller is programmed so that each stack contains a predetermined 
number of articles which must be moved away from the 
stacking region upon completion thereof. In order to operate the 
production machine continuously, without any slowing down or  
 
dwell, the prior art suggests the use of two symmetrical units 
for the withdrawal and stacking of the articles. The two units 
work alternately so that when one of them has completed a stack 
or pack, the subsequent articles are directed towards the other 
unit, thereby allowing the previously formed stack to be 
unloaded. Such machines are disclosed, for example, in the U.S. 
Patents 5,088,975 and 4,921, 235. These known apparatuses are provided with two side-by-side 
rotating cylinders, each of which is associated with a respective 
belt conveyor with relevant expeller member. A selecting device 
diverts the articles coming from the production machine towards 
one or the other conveyor. This requires a considerably larger 
machine, and the use of a particularly delicate diverting 
mechanism which is subject to malfunctions. European patent No. 076,939 shows an apparatus of the above-mentioned 
type, which has some of the features
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the transfer of single articles 
(M) in sheet form, such as paper napkins, and for stacking 

said articles in stacks (P1, P2) of a pre-determined number 
of articles, including: 


a conveyor (17, 23) which picks up said articles 
from a delivery means (11) by grasping them along their 

edges; 
at least two expellers (27, 29), disposed along 
said conveyor, and provided with reciprocating motion to 

remove said articles from the conveyor onto corresponding 
stacker means (31, 35; 33, 37); 
the expellers (27, 29) being aligned in the 
direction of advancement of said conveyor and working 

alternately; 
the articles which are fed to the expeller (29) 
which is further away from the delivery means (11) passing 

the expeller (27) which lies closer to the delivery 
means without being affected thereby; 
 
characterized in that
 
each expeller (27, 29) is provided with continuous,
 
   reciprocating motion even when it is not contacting any 

article, and further that the expeller (27) which is 
closest to the delivery means (11) may be moved in the 

direction of its reciprocating working motion so as to  
 

alternately take up an operative position (27X, 27Y), in 
which it crosses the trajectory of advancement of the 

articles fed by said conveyor (17, 23), and an inoperative 
position (27X', 27Y'), in which it does not cross said 

trajectory of advancement of the articles. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the expeller (27) closest to the delivery means (11) 

is operated by a shaft (55) which can oscillate about its 
axis (A-A), which shaft is formed by two portions (55A, 55B) 

between which a clutch (67, 69, 81) is disposed, and in that 
means (85, 98, 99) are provided to offset the mutual angular 

position of said two shaft portions. 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that said clutch is a friction clutch which allows a 

mutual angular offset of the two portions (55A, 55B) of the 
shaft (55). 
An apparatus according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that one (55B) of said portions of the 

shaft (55) has a disk (85) angularly engaged thereon and 
which is provided with two teeth (91, 93) able to cooperate 

with respective abutments (95, 97), said abutments being 
disposed with respect to said disk (85) in such a way that, 

when a first abutment cooperates with one of said teeth, the 
other abutment does not interfere with the other tooth. 
An apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that said two abutments (95, 97) are formed on a rocker  

 
member (98) oscillating about an axis (B-B) parallel to the 

axis (A-A) of the shaft (55).
