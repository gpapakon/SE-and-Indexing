<ABSTRACT>
A distributor device for compressed air and/or other media is proposed. The distributor device has a distributor housing (1) with a distributor space (3) and a longitudinal slot (2) opening into the distributor space (3). Two sealing strips (7, 8) facing one another are provided in the area of the longitudinal slot. A pressure space (24) provided in addition to the distributor space (3) is formed on the rear side of each sealing strip (7, 8). Fluidic pressure medium can be admitted to the pressure space (24) in order to press the sealing strips (7, 8) against one another in a sealing manner. In this way, a reliable seal is guaranteed irrespective of any remaining plastic deformations of the sealing-strip material.

Distributor device for compressed air and/or other in particular
gaseous media, with a distributor housing (1) closed at

its end face by housing covers (4, 5) and provided with a longitudinal
slot (2), in which housing a distributor chamber (3)

supplying the medium to be distributed is located, with two sealing
strips (7, 8) serving to seal the distributor chamber (3) in

the area of the longitudinal slot (2) and extending along the
longitudinal slot (2), which are arranged opposite each other in

the area of either of the two slot edges and at the rear side
(10) of each of which a pressure chamber (24) extending along the

associated sealing strip (7, 8) is provided in addition to the
distributor chamber (3), each of said pressure chambers (24)

being bounded by a wall section (25) capable of lateral movement,
which is formed by the associated sealing strip (7, 8) or applies

pressure thereto, and being supplied with pressure fluid from the
distributor chamber (3) via connecting galleries communicating

therewith, so that the sealing strips (7, 8) are pressed against
each other by pressurization, and with a tapping part (12) movable

along the longitudinal slot (2) and reaching between the two
sealing strips (7, 8), thereby locally spreading them apart, with

a spreader body (13) serving to transmit the medium, characterized
in that the connecting galleries (27, 27') are provided in

at least one of the housing covers (4, 5) on the end faces of the
distributor housing (1), one end terminating on the face of the

distributor chamber (3), while the other end terminates on the
face of one of the pressure chambers(24).
Distributor device according to claim 1, characterized in
that each pressure chamber (24) is formed in a hose body (26,

26') fixed to the distributor housing (1). 
Distributor device according to claim 2, characterized in
that each sealing strip (7, 8) is directly formed by a wall section

(25) on one of the hose bodies (26).
Distributor device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized
in that each hose body (26, 26') is provided with an integral

retaining profile (32), by means of which the hose body (26, 26')
is located in a retaining groove (33) provided on the distributor

housing (1).
Distributor device according to any of claims 2 to 4, characterized
in that the wall of each hose body (26, 26') consists

of a material with rubber-elastic properties.
Distributor device according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the sealin
g strips (7, 8) are arranged between
the slot edges of the distributor housing (1) and preferably at

least substantially radially outside the distributor chamber (3).
Distributor device according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that each sealing strip (7, 8) is provided with an

integral sealing lip (28, 28') projecting towards the distributor
chamber (3) and extending along the sealing strip (7, 8).
Distributor device according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that the tapping part (12) is mounted for longitudinal

movement in two guide grooves (38) provided in the housing
on both sides of the longitudinal slot (2), in particular recessed

in the external circumference of the distributor housing (1).
Distributor device according to claim 8, characterized in
that the tapping part (12) is provided with guide sections (43)

reaching into the guide grooves (38) and engaging behind the
guide surfaces (44) of the guide grooves (38) to secure the tapping

part (12) against being lifted off the distributor housing
(1) at right angles to its traversing direction (18). 
Distributor device according to claim 9, characterized in
that guide rollers (45) capable of rolling on the guide surfaces

(44) of the guide grooves (38) are provided on the guide sections
(34).
Distributor device according to any of claims 8 to 10, characterized
in that the distributor housing (1) has a rectangular

and in particular square external shape, the tapping part (12)
being exclusively mounted in the area of one of the four external

surfaces (37), the remaining three external surfaces being free
of tapping parts.
