<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a GaP pure green light emitting
element substrate, and more precisely to a GaP pure green light
emitting element substrate comprising a plurality of GaP layers
formed on a GaP single crystal substrate, which is used to
manufacture high-brightness GaP pure green light emitting elements.Light emitting elements such as light emitting diodes are
normally obtained by layering a plurality of semiconductor
layers on a semiconductor substrate to prepare a multi-layer
semiconductor substrate with a pn junction, and then making it
into elements for practical use. Among them, green light
emitting diodes can be obtained by using a light emitting
element substrate prepared by forming one or more layers of
both n-type and p-type GaP, one after another, on an n-type GaP
single crystal substrate. GaP is an indirect transition-type semiconductor, and
therefore the brightness is very low if a pn junction is just
formed. Because of this, nitrogen (N), which would function as
light emitting centers, is added to the n-type GaP layer near
the pn junction in order to enhance the brightness. However,
a light emitting diode prepared from a GaP light emitting
element substrate which has the nitrogen-added n-type GaP layer
emits a yellowish-green light with a peak wavelength of about
567 nm and therefore it does not give a pure green light with
a peak wavelength of about 555 nm.Because of this, a structure with a lowered carrier concentration
in the n-type GaP layer or p-type GaP layer near the pn
junction has been proposed for the purpose of obtaining pure
green light emission with a high brightnes without adding
nitrogen.Figure 5 shows a cross-sectional structure of a GaP pure
green light emitting diode which has an n-type GaP layer with
a low carrier concentration (net donor concentration) formed on
an n-type GaP layer with a high concentration of the impurity
(electrodes are not shown). This type of cross-sectional
structure is disclosed in Japanese unexamined patent publication
(Tokkai) Sho 59-214276, for example. In this GaP pure
green light emitting diode, as shown in Figure 5 (A), an n-type 
GaP layer 51, a low-carrier-concentration n-type GaP layer 52
and a p-type GaP layer 53 are formed, one after another, on an
n-type GaP single crystal substrate 50, and said
low-carrier-concentration n-type GaP layer 52 functions as the
light emitting layer.In this GaP pure green light emitting diode, as shown in
Figure 5 (B), the net donor concentration (n) in the
low-carrier-concentration n-type GaP layer
