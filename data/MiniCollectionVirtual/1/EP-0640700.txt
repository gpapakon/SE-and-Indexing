<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrodeposition coating 
compositions. Electrodeposition coating, or electrocoating, is 
widely used in the art for the application of polymer coatings 
to metal substrates. Electrodeposition baths usually comprise a 
principal film-forming resin, such as an acrylic or epoxy resin, 
with ionic groups that can be salted so that the resin can be 
dispersed or dissolved in an aqueous bath. Pigments (dispersed 
in resin pastes), dyes, flow control agents, and other additives 
are often included in the electrocoat bath. For automotive or industrial applications where hard 
electrocoat films are desired, the bath also includes a blocked 
crosslinking agent that unblocks under appropriate conditions 
(e.g., with the application of heat) to react with functional 
groups on the principal resin and thus cure the coating. One of the advantages of electrodeposition coating 
compositions and processes is that the coating composition can 
be applied to a variety of metallic substrates regardless of 
shape or configuration. This is especially advantageous when 
the coating is applied as an anticorrosive coating onto a 
substrate having a number of irregular surfaces, such as a motor 
vehicle body. In order to maximize an electrodeposition 
coating's anticorrosion effectiveness, it is important that the 
coating form a contiguous layer over all portions of the 
metallic substrate. Two criteria for measuring the effectiveness of an 
electrodeposition coating for covering all portions of the 
substrate are throwpower and edge coverage. Throwpower measures 
the effectiveness of an electrodeposition coating at covering 
recessed or interior areas of a metal substrate. Edge coverage 
measures the effectiveness of an electrodeposition coating at 
covering the edges of a metallic substrate. Good throwpower and  
 
edge coverage are important in order to maximize an 
electrodeposition coating's anticorrosion effectiveness. Electrodeposition coatings must often satisfy a number 
of other criteria as well. A high degree of smoothness is often 
desirable. For example, when the electrodeposition coating 
serves as a primer for a high-gloss topcoat, the primer layer 
must be very smooth in order for the topcoat to have a 
satisfactory appearance. It is also advantageous to exhibit 
stability over a range of pH. It is therefore desirable to provide an 
electrodeposition coating composition that provides good 
throwpower and edge coverage, without compromising overall 
corrosion protection and smoothness.
