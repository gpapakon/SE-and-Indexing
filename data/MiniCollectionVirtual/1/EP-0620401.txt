<ABSTRACT>
The luminaire has a housing (1) comprising end caps (10) which have 
resilient means (11) to keep a lamellae grid (20) fixed in the light emission window (5). 

The means (11) cooperate with the end faces (22) of lamellae (21). Thereby they are 
suitable to be used to fix grids of several kinds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a luminaire provided with: 
a housing with a base wall having a longitudinal direction and side walls 
extending away therefrom in the longitudinal direction with end caps transverse thereto; a louvre comprising slats which have end faces adjacent the side walls in a 
light emission window opposite the base wall; the end caps comprising resilient means which hold the louvre in the 
window. Such a luminaire is known from DE 858 583. The louvre of the known luminaire has a V-shaped reflector which 
interconnects the slats centrally between their end faces. Near the end caps, the reflector 
has recesses in its end surfaces into which blade springs fastened to the end caps 
engage. It is necessary for a stable positioning of the louvre that the points of contact of 
a blade spring in a end surface lie wide apart. For this purpose, the blade springs in 
the known luminaire are placed close to the base wall, high in the luminaire. As a 
result, they are accessible only with difficulty if they are to be pressed from the 
recesses for removing the louvre. 
In addition, the legs of the V-shaped reflector are wide apart in order to position said 
points of contact further away from one another. The reflector as a result intercepts 
light, which cannot issue to the exterior through the emission window. A V-shaped 
reflector is essential for the known fastening of the louvre. EP 0 017 825 discloses a construction for fastening a louvre with slats of 
a triangular cross-section whose end faces project each through a respective reflector. 
Two openings are present in some slats, in the base thereof facing towards the base 
wall. Resilient elements coupled two-by-two extend away from the base wall and carry 
hooks which grip into the openings of the slats. 
The resilient elements have a complicated shape. Special provisions must be present at  
 
the base wall for fastening them. Furthermore, the known construction is suitable only 
for louvres having such triangular slats. It is an object of the invention to provide a luminaire of the kind 
described in the opening paragraph which is of a simple construction and which is 
suitable for holding slats of different shapes. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the resilient 
means cooperate with the end faces of the slats. Because of their points of application, i.e. the end faces of the slats, it is 
of no importance for the luminaire according to the invention whether the louvre has a 
V-shaped reflector in the centre of
