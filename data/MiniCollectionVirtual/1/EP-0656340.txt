<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for reactivating an at least 
partially deactivated copper-containing ester hydrogenation 

catalyst which has undergone deactivation through use in 
hydrogenation of an unsaturated organic compound selected 

from esters of C₈ to C₂₂ monocarboxylic acids, diesters of 
dicarboxylic acids, and lactones, to yield a corresponding 

hydroxylic compound selected from alcohols and diols which 
comprises contacting the at least partially deactivated 

copper-containing catalyst at an effective reactivation 
temperature and for an effective period of time with a 

stream of hydrogen-containing gas which is substantially 
free from the unsaturated organic compound thereby to 

reactivate the at least partially deactivated copper-containing 

catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of a hydroxylic compound selected from alcohols
and diols by hydrogenation of a corresponding unsaturated
organic compound selected from esters, diesters and
lactones.Various processes have been described for the
production of alcohols and diols by hydrogenation of a
corresponding unsaturated organic compound selected from
esters, diesters and lactones in the presence of a
heterogeneous ester hydrogenation catalyst. Such
unsaturated organic compounds are unsaturated by virtue of
their possessing a carbon-to-oxygen double bond in the
linkage -(CO)-O-. They do not need to possess any further
unsaturated linkages. Hydrogenation processes of this type
are thus applicable to a wide variety of esters, diesters
and lactones which contain no unsaturation apart from the
afore-mentioned carbon-to-oxygen double bond, for example
monoesters of C8 to C22 alkylcarboxylic acids, diesters of
C4 to C16 dicarboxylic acids, and lactones of
hydroxycarboxylic acids containing 4 to 16 carbon atoms.
However, the presence of further unsaturation in the
molecule is not excluded. Thus there can also be used in
such processes esters, diesters and lactones which contain
further unsaturation in the molecule, for example monoesters
of unsaturated C8 to C22 aliphatic carboxylic acids,
diesters of unsaturated aliphatic or alicyclic carboxylic
acids, and unsaturated lactones.Examples of such hydrogenation processes, many of
which are conventionally conducted in the liquid phase,
include hydrogenation of alkyl esters of aliphatic
monocarboxylic acids to alkanols, and of dialkyl esters of 
aliphatic dicarboxylic acids to aliphatic diols. It has
also been proposed in some cases to effect the hydrogenation
reaction under vapour phase reaction conditions.It is known to produce the cycloaliphatic diol
cyclohexanedimethanol by hydrogenation of the corresponding
cycloaliphatic diester, usually a dialkyl cyclohexanedicarboxylate,
which may itself be produced by hydrogenation
of the corresponding dialkyl benzenedicarboxylate, for
example dimethyl terephthalate.A commercial hydrogenation catalyst used for
hydrogenation of carboxylic acid esters is copper chromite
which may optionally be promoted with barium and/or
manganese. The use of such a catalyst in a process for the
production of butane-1,4-diol is disclosed in EP-A-0143634.
In WO-A-82/03854 there is disclosed a process for effecting
the hydrogenolysis of carboxylic acid esters which involves
the use of a catalyst comprising a reduced
