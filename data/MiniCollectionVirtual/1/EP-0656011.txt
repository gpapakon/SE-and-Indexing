<ABSTRACT>
Small, anti-inflammatory compounds that are peptide analogs are described useful to inhibit inflammation of a mammal's skin, mucous membranes, or lacerations of the musculature or injury to the brain or leakage of fluids into the air spaces of the lungs. Peptide analogs of the invention have the primary sequence TN-A1-A2-A3-A4-A5-A6-TC where one of the moieties is in the D-configuration. A1 and A2 are each a basic polar amino acid while each of A3, A4, and A6 is a hydrophobic amino acid. A5 can be a variety of structures and appears to function to optimize the spatial relationship between the hydrophobic and the basic residues. TN is selected or modified to convey resistance against enzymatic degradation. TC is an amino group or an amidated amino acid, preferably hydrophobic.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PEPTIDE ANALOGS AND TREATMENT TO INHIBIT VASCULAR LEAKAGE IN INJURED TISSUESField of the Invention:This invention generally relates to anti- inflammatory agents and to uses in reducing inflammatory responses, such as edema in connection with brain, skin, mucous membranes and muscle injuries, and more particularly to the use of relatively small, synthetic peptide analogs that have the property of inhibiting vascular leakage. This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. PatentApplication Serial Number 07/925, 081, filed August 4, 1992, which was a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent 5,177,060, issued January 5, 1993, both of common assignment herewith.Background of the Invention: Inflammation is signaled by redness, swelling, heat and pain as a reaction of the body against injury or assault. A variety of chemicals have been implicated as chemical mediators of the inflammatory reaction, including histamine, kinins, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factors, leukotrienes, and, from nerve endings, substance P. Mediators of the acute inflammatory reaction seem to play roles in one or more of increasing vascular permeability, attracting leukocytes, producing pain, local edema and necrosis. A variety of physiologic responses occur from the biological events that constitute the inflammatory processes. For example, Pinckard et al. at Chapter 10 describe platelet-activating factors ("PAF") in the text Inflammation : Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates (Gallin et al . , Eds., 1988) . This family of structurally related compounds appears to promote a variety of physiologic actions that are directly or indirectly related to inflammatory reactions. The authors note that PAF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease conditions such as septic shock and organ transplantation rejection. 

 Swelling is a characteristic inflammatory response of tissues to injury. Swelling is produced by leakage of water and solutes of the blood directly into the tissue matrix. The increased leakiness of blood vessels after injury may be due to direct damage of blood vessels or may occur after the release of substances such as histamine (inflammatory mediators) that open up gaps between endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. A mild degree of swelling (or edema) does not affect the functional integrity of injured tissues (except perhaps in the brain) , but, in severe injuries, massive swelling distorts tissue architecture, impedes the delivery of oxygen to cells, and causes extensive fluid loss from
