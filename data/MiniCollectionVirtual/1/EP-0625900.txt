<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to compositions for the sustained release of drugs and to methods for the production of such compositions. In one embodiment, somatotropin is layered onto non-pareil seeds, which, in turn are sprayed with a glycine solution. Next, a coating of a wax mixture is applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions and 
processes for the sustained release of drugs. 
Sustained release compositions or devices for the 
delayed release of drugs have been used for many years. 
Such compositions or devices increase the effectiveness 
of many drugs. Various compositions have been 
developed, each with a varying degree of success. For example, the use of drug-containing pellets 
known as non-pareil seeds has been known since at least 
1862. See e.g., U.S. 36,816. Non-pareil seeds are 
pellets made from sugar and starch. Subsequently, 
these drug containing pellets came to be coated with a 
digestible or dispersable delayed release coating. 
Often, various coatings having different release 
characteristics would be used on groups of pellets 
which then would be combined in a single gelatin 
capsule. As recognized in U.S. 3,119,742, 
this procedure had the significant 
disadvantage of being limited to drugs of relatively 
small doses. U.S. 4,871,549, 
discloses one method of preparing a 
sustained release composition. Pellets incorporating a 
swelling agent are coated with an outer membrane. The  
 
Swelling agent absorbs fluid and the outer membrane 
breaks, releasing the drug quickly from each pellet. EP-A-0338383 discloses orally administrable delayed 
release compositions in which a core containing an 
active substance is coated with two or more layers, one 
of which is an acid layer, and the other a bonding layer 
comprising a pH-sensitive polymer and an insoluble 
polymer. An optional membrane layer may also be 
included, between the core and the acid layer. A need exists for new and improved methods and 
compositions which administer drugs in a sustained 
fashion. Particularly with respect to proteins such as 
somatotropins, which are most effective when 
administered over a period of days or weeks, there is a 
need for such processes and compositions. The present invention relates to compositions and 
processes for the sustained release of drugs, including 
proteins. A preferred composition of the present 
invention includes non-pareil seeds which have been 
coated with a drug, preferably a protein such as 
somatotropin, and most preferably porcine somatotropin. 
The protein coat surrounds the non-pareil seeds. In 
one embodiment, a primary coating layer comprising a 
water-soluble agent selected from glycine, alanine and 
sucrose, surrounds the protein coat. A secondary 
coating layer, typically wax, surrounds the entire 
device. In another embodiment, a tablet containing a
