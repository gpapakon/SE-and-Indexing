<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing a ceramic filter 
having a given pore size required as a filter membrane 

and also having superior alkali resistance and acid 
resistance. The filter of the present invention is 

produced by preparing an aggregate comprising alumina 
coarse particles and a sintering aid comprising 

alumina-zirconium mixed particles containing not more 
than 90 wt.% of alumina, blending said alumina coarse 

particles and alumina-zirconium mixed particles so as 
for alumina to be in an amount of from 80 to 99 wt.% 

based on the total weight of the starting materials, 
forming the blended starting materials to have a 

desired shape, and firing the formed product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic 
filter utilized in the production of food, drink, 
pharmaceuticals and so forth. It also relates to a 
process for manufacturing the same. In food industries or pharmaceutical 
industries, ultrafiltration or the like using ceramic 
filters has been hitherto carried out to remove 
unwanted substances included in stock solutions or to 
concentrate given substances in stock solutions. Such ceramic filters gradually are plugged 
with their use because of organic matters such as 
proteins, resulting in an lowering of filtering 
performance. Accordingly, as a conventional means, 
ceramic filters are washed with an alkali or an acid to 
remove organic matters so that the filtering 
performance can be restored. Since, however, ceramic filters contain not 
only Al₂O₃ as a main component but also alkali- or 
acid-soluble components such as SiO₂, CaO and Na₂O, and 
these components are dissolved out as a result of 
washing to bring about a great lowering of the 
performance. To eliminate the above disadvantages, 
Japanese Laid-open Patent Application N° 59-225716 
proposes to produce a filter using alumina with a high 
purity of 99.9 % or more, and Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Application N° 63-197510 proposes to add MgO and ZrO₂ 
as sintering aids. Of the above methods, the method in which 
alumina with a high purity is used makes it necessary 
to carry out sintering at a high temperature and 
requires a special sintering furnace. In addition, 
alumina coarse particles of from 20 to 30 µm in 
particle diameter must be sintered in order to obtain a  
 
filter of about 10 µm in pore size. In such an 
instance, no sufficient strength can be obtained even 
if MgO and ZrO₂ are added as sintering aids, unless the 
sintering is carried out at a high temperature of 
1,800°C or more. An object of the present invention is to 
solve the above problems the conventional ceramic 
filters have had. Thus, the present invention is relating to a 
process for manufacturing a ceramic filter, comprising 
the steps of :
 
   preparing an aggregate comprising alumina 
coarse particles and a sintering aid comprising 
alumina-zirconium mixed particles containing not more 
than 90 wt.% of alumina ;
 
   blending said alumina coarse particles and 
alumina-zirconium mixed particles so as for alumina to 
be in an amount of from 80 to 99 wt.% based on the 
total weight of the starting materials ;
 
   forming the blended starting materials to 
have a desired shape ; and
 
   sintering the formed
