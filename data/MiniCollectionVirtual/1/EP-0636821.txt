<ABSTRACT>
The present invention comprises an improved two-way dynamic 
shaft-sealing member for a 

fluid transport system having a butterfly valve with an 
inflatable seal (12) with the improved shaft-sealing 

member including a rigid race (104) secured to and carried by the 
interface portion of the 

inflatable seal to maintain the integrity of the interface portion 
of the seal with a compressible 

sealing ring (105) located in the race and held in confinement by 
the race to hold the sealing ring in a 

sealing condition against the inside of the race and the outside of 
the shaft (16) to prevent fluids 

from escaping therepast as the shaft is moved or the inflatable seal 
is inflated or deflated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to static and dynamic shaft seals located in inflatable seals for
butterfly valves and, more specifically, to improvements to a two-way static and dynamic shaft
seal carried by the portion of the inflatable seal that forms an interface between the transported
fluids and the fluids used to pressurize the inflatable seal.US-A-4,836,499 shows a butterfly valve with a shaft sealing member located in the
inflatable seal corresponding to the preamble of claim 1 and, more specifically, around the
portion of shaft of the butterfly valve
extending through the resilient portion of the inflatable seal that forms an interface between the
transport line and the inflation chamber of the inflatable seal. Typically, butterfly valves are
used to open or close lines that transport fluids that may contain liquids and or solids. One of
the features of most butterfly valves is that the shaft, which extends through the inflatable seal,
must be statically and dynamically sealed against the side walls of an opening extending
through the resilient portion of the inflatable seal to prevent fluids from escaping therepast.
This sealing is more critical if the transport system is to handle liquids and the like that remain
under pressure whether the butterfly valve is open or closed. One of the difficulties in making
an effective static and dynamic chamber seal is that the physical integrity of the sealing member
around the shaft should be maintained or the effectiveness of the inflatable seal may be
compromised. Unless the static and dynamic shaft seal is effective one cannot prevent the
fluids being transported from contaminating the fluids used to inflate the seal as well as prevent
the fluids used to inflate the seals from contaminating the transported fluids. This problem is
particularly acute if the fluid transport lines remains pressurized when the butterfly valve
inflatable seal is deflated since without an effective shaft seal the pressurized transport fluids
leaks out along the shaft and into the inflation chamber of the inflatable seal. Thus one of the problems in sealing the transport lines from the inflation chamber of the
inflatable valves is that the shaft-sealing member is located around the shaft of a butterfly valve
that extends through a resilient member that forms part of an inflatable seal which expands and
contracts in response to pressurization of the inflatable seal. The two-way static and dynamic
shaft-sealing member must be such that the liquid pressures from the transport

A butterfly valve for opening and closing an opening in
a conduit comprising:


a housing (13) having an inflatable sealing member (12)
located in said housing (13), said inflatable sealing member

(12) made from an elastomer material, said inflatable sealing
member (12) having elastomer legs (50, 52) that lengthen and

contract in response to pressurization; and a self-cleaning
elastomer sealing portion (100) of sufficient thickness that

moves radially inward and outward as a unit in response to
pressurization of said inflatable sealing member (12), said

elastomer sealing portion (100) being locally deformable to form
a seal around a rotatable butterfly disk (11), said inflatable

sealing member (12) including means (55, 56) to hold said
inflatable sealing member (12) in position on said housing (13)

to form an inflation chamber (70) between said housing (13) and
said inflatable sealing member (12), said inflatable sealing

member (12) having an interface portion (51) forming an interface
between a transport side of said inflatable sealing portion

and said inflation chamber (70), said rotatable butterfly disk
(11) being mounted on a shaft (16) extending through said

inflatable sealing member (12), said butterfly disk (11) having
an exterior edge (11a) which, when in the closed condition and

when said inflatable sealing member (12) is in an uninflated
condition, has a clearance (18, 18a) therebetween, characterized

in that said sealing portion (100) further comprises:
an annular rigid race (104) having an exterior surface
(101a, 102a, 103a) bonded to and carried by said interface

portion (51) of said inflatable sealing member (12) and a cavity
defined by three internal sides (101b, 102b, 103b); and a

sealing ring (105) located in said cavity of said annular rigid
race (104), so that when said shaft (16) extends through said

annular rigid race (104) said sealing ring (105) is held in 
compressive sealing relationship against said shaft (16) by said

three internal sides (101b, 102b, 103b) of said annular rigid
race (104), such as to provide for a two-way fluid seal in

either direction of said shaft (16), permitting at the same time
relative movement between said shaft (16) and said interface

portion (51) of said inflatable sealing member (12).
The butterfly valve of claim 1 wherein said annular
rigid race (104) is metal.
The butterfly of claims 1 or 2 wherein said annular
rigid race (104) has a radially internal dimension which is

slightly larger than a diameter of said shaft (16) to permit
unhindered and unscored movement of said shaft (16) with respect

to said annular rigid race (104) during expansion and
contraction of said sealing member (12).
The butterfly valve of one or more of the preceding
claims wherein said annular rigid race (104) has a U-shaped

cross section.
The butterfly valve of one or more of the preceding
claims wherein said annular rigid race (104) has said exterior

surface (101a, 102a, 103a) molded to said inflatable sealing
