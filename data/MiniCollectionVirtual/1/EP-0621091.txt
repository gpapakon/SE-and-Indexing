<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a tubular member of 
polygonal cross-section from a tubular blank (36) of 

substantially round cross-section includes the steps of 
providing a lower die (40) member having a cavity portion 

submerged substantially below the top surface (46) of the 
lower die and having a cavity width equal to the width of 

the desired tubular member and less than the diameter of 
the tubular blank. The lower die has an entry opening 

(50) which opens to the top surface of the lower die and 
is defined by angularly disposed funnel walls (52,54) 

which converge to intersect with the cavity portion. The 
tubular blank is placed onto the lower die so that the 

blank rests on the angularly disposed funnel walls above 
the cavity portion. An upper die (42) is lowered onto 

the lower die. The upper die has a lid wall (82) which 
forces the tubular blank downwardly into the cavity 

portion while the angularly disposed funnel walls guide 
the tubular blank to collapse it in a manner preventing 

pinching of the tubular blank between the upper and lower 
dies. The application of internal hydraulic pressure 

then expands the collapsed tubular blank outwardly to 
the shape defined by the cavity portion of the lower die 

and the lid wall of the upper die.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of forming a 
shaped tubular member using internal hydraulic pressure, 
and a die assembly therefor. It is known to form the cross-sectional profile 
of a tubular member by a hydroforming process in which a 
tubular blank is placed within a die and hydraulic fluid 
pressure is applied to the interior of the tubular blank 
to expand the tubular blank into the shape defined by the 
die cavity. The hydroforming process is particularly 
useful for transforming a commercially available round 
tubular shape into an elongated box shape tubular frame 
member of the type useful in the manufacture of 
automobile vehicle body and chassis. The prior art has recognised that the 
circumferential expansion of the tubular blank is limited 
to about 2-5% (without significantly thinning the tube) 
when using readily available commercial grades of tubular 
steel. Accordingly, the circumferential measure of the 
tubular blank can be only about 2-5% less than the 
circumferential measure of the box shape end product so 
that closing the box shape cavity of the hydroforming 
dies about the round tubular blank is akin to the 
proverbial problem of forcing a round peg into a square 
hole. US-A-5070717 discloses a method of forming a 
tubular member from a tubular round blank including the 
steps of providing a pair of dies each of which has a 
cavity, the cavities, on closing of the dies, defining a 
cavity portion having the approximate cross-sectional 
shape of the tubular member; positioning the blank in one 
of the cavities; moving the dies to the closed position 
to collapse the blank into the cavity portion; and 
applying internal pressure to the collapse blank to form 
the tubular member.  
 A method in accordance with the present 
invention is defined by the combination of the features specified in 
Claim 1. A die assembly according to the present invention is defined in claim 4. The present invention provides an improved 
hydroforming die assembly and method by which a round 
tubular blank having a diameter greater than the width of 
the desired finish product can be placed into the 
hydroforming die assembly, the die assembly closed to 
force the tubular blank into a shaped cavity portion, and 
then hydraulic pressure employed to expand the collapsed  
 
tubular blank into the shape defined by the cavity 
portion. The present invention also provides a die 
assembly of economical manufacture and low maintenance. In the method of the present invention, the 
first and second dies

A method of forming a tubular member (10) 
having a polygon cross-section from a tubular blank (36) 

having a substantially round cross-section, comprising 
the steps of providing first and second dies (40,42) 

having an open position to permit the placement of the 
tubular blank (36) therebetween and a closed position defining 

therebetween a cavity portion having the approximate 
cross-sectional shape of the tubular member (10), the first 

die (40) having a cavity (44) with an overall depth greater 
than the desired depth (h) of the tubular member (10), and 

including a forming portion having a width equal to the 
width (w) of the tubular member (10) to be formed and less 

than the diameter of the tubular blank (36) and a depth equal 
to the depth of the tubular member (10), and an entry portion 

having walls (52,54) spaced at a width greater than the 
width of the tubular member (10) and converging angularly to 

the width of the forming portion, the cavity portion 
being defined by the forming portion of the cavity and 

the second die (42) in said closed position; positioning the tubular 
blank (36) in the 

entry portion; moving the first (40) and second dies (42) relative 
to one another from the open position to the closed 

position whereby the tubular blank (36) is engaged and forced 
into the cavity portion by the second die (42), the walls (52,54) of 

the entry portion engaging and guiding the collapse of 
the tubular blank (36) as the tubular blank (36) is forced into the 

cavity portion; and applying internal pressure to the

position to cause the expansion of the collapsed tubular 
blank (36) to the cross-sectional shape defined between the

position of the dies (40,42) co-operates with the forming 
portion of the cavity (44) of the first die (40) to

tubular blank (36) to force the tubular blank (36) into the 
forming portion during closing of the dies (40,42). 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the step of applying internal pressure is at a 

predetermined pressure level which does not forcibly

(64,66); and wherein, in the closed position, the lid  
 

wall (82) defines with the side walls corners (92,94) 
which are left void on formation of the tubular member 

(10).
