<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ocular hypotensive agent. Glaucoma, a pathologic state in which intraocular pressure exceeding 
the normal range of 10 - 20 mmHg results in eyesight disorder, is among the 
intractable ophthalmopathies. Recently, the incidence of low tension 
glaucoma has increased. Low tension glaucoma, occurring when intraocular 
pressure is less than 21 mmHg, reduces the field of vision and impairs ocular 
blood flow. The current therapy for glaucoma, including low tension 
glaucoma is to lower intraocular pressure. For glaucoma chemotherapy, 
choline agonists, represented by pilocarpine, and anti-choline esterase agents 
have long been used as eyedrops. These drugs, however, cause severe side 
effects such as iridic cystoma, iris synechia, cataract and retinal detachment 
when used in long-term continuous administration, as well as a sensation of 
darkness due to mydriasis, eye injection and other symptoms. Although sympathetic nerve agonists such as epinephrine and 
dipivefrine have been used for their ocular hypotensive action, their use is 
limited to open-angle glaucoma, and can cause mydriasis, blepharitis and 
conjunctival pigmentation and systemic symptoms such as increased heart 
rate and hypertension. In recent years, β-blockers such as timolol, pindolol and carteolol have 
been widely used, since they are advantageous in that their instillation 
suppresses aqueous humor production to lower ocular tension, without acting 
on the pupil. These drugs, however, tend to cause local symptoms such as 
feelings of eye dryness, allergic blepharitis and superficial keratitis. The only group of ocular hypotensive agents that can be used 
systemically in long-term continuous administration is carbonic acid 
dehydrogenase inhibitors such as acetazolamide and metazolamide, but these 
can cause gastrointestinal disorder, ureteroliths and electrolytic anomalies. In recent years, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (e.g.,

21614/1984, 130816/1984, 209527/1985, 10553/1986, 203665/1988 and 
218612/1990), which inhibit the renin-angiotensin system involved in blood  
 
pressure regulation, have been reported useful as glaucoma remedies [J. 
Ocular Pharmacol., 3, 295-307 (1987); Am. J. Ophthalmol., 105, 674-677 
(1988)], but none have seen practical application. Compounds exhibiting angiotensin II antagonistic action are known to 
serve as therapeutic agents for circulatory diseases such as hypertension, 
heart diseases
