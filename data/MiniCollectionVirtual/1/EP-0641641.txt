<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for deforming an edge, 
or a part of an edge, of a sandwich material which is made up 

of at least one core which is deformable under the influence 
of heat and one or two top layers which are deformable under 

the influence of heat and/or pressure, wherein an edge of the 
sandwich material is introduced into a mold at a temperature 

at which the materials of the core and the top layer(s) are 
thermoplastically deformable, and the sandwich material is 

deformed by moving the sandwich material relative to the mold, 
the shape of the edge being consolidated by cooling during or 

after the deformation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for deforming an edge 
of a sandwich material which is made up of at least one core 
which is deformable under the influence of heat and one or two 
top layers which are deformable under the influence of heat 
and/or pressure, more specifically to the provision of an edge 
finish on at least a part of an edge of such a material. Sheet-like materials, such as sandwich constructions, are 
often applied in those areas where materials are used which 
must combine high strength or stiffness with a light weight. 
This is the case, for example, in aircraft, aerospace and 
transport applications. Sandwich constructions generally consist of a core 
material which is light in weight, with a top layer, often 
reinforced, on both surfaces thereof. Owing to the good 
bonding between the top layers and the core material, the 
proper stiffness is obtained. The other properties of the 
sandwich material are partly determined by the nature of the 
various starting materials used. Known sandwich constructions are based on a core material 
with a honeycomb structure. Another known type of sandwich 
material is described in European patent applications 264 495, 
268 148 and 313,171, the contents of which are incorporated 
herein by reference. This material is entirely thermoplastic 
and consists of a core material comprising inter alia a 
thermoplastic foam and two top layers consisting of a fiber-reinforced 
synthetic material such as polycarbonate or 
polyetherimide. European patent application 313 171 describes a flame-retardant 
sheet-like material which is also thermoplastic. In the application of such sandwich materials, there 
exists a desire for the possibility of providing the sandwich 
materials with a finish at the edges thereof, for instance for 
use in situations where these edges are exposed to view.  
 
Further, it may be important to finish the edges if they come 
into contact with moisture or if they may easily sustain 
damage. There is also a need for a system in which one or more 
accessories can be provided on or in the edges of the 
material. From European patent application 269 148 it is known to 
cause the core to melt at the edges of such sandwich materials 
by heating under pressure perpendicularly to a top layer, 
whereby the top layers are bonded to each other. In this way, 
a kind of flange is obtained at the lateral edge of the 
sandwich material. Although this method already provides an increase of the 
possibilities, there continues to exist a desire for the

A method for deforming an edge, or a part of an edge, of 
a sandwich material which is made up of at least one core 

which is deformable under the influence of heat and one or two 
top layer(s) which is/are deformable under the influence of 

heat and/or pressure, wherein an edge of the sandwich material 
is introduced into a mold at a temperature at which the 

materials of the core and the top layer(s) are 
thermoplastically deformable or thermoformable, and the 

sandwich material is deformed by moving the sandwich material 
relative to the mold, the form of the edge being consolidated 

by cooling during or after the deformation. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein a sandwich 
material is used which is made up of at least one 

thermoplastic foam as core and two thermoplastic top layers. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a mold is 
used which is heated to a temperature above the softening 

point of the material of the toplayer(s). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the edge to 
be finished is first rendered deformable by heating and 

subsequently deformed in a cold mold. 
A method according to claims 1-4, wherein the edge to be 
finished is heated and provisionally shaped in a first, heated 

mold and, subsequently, the edge to be finished is given its 
final shape in a second mold. 
A method according to claims 1-5, wherein the finished 
edge is allowed to harden outside the mold. 
A method according to claims 1-6, wherein, for obtaining 
the final shape, a mold is used having a rounded portion whose 

shape corresponds to an arc of a circle of a radius 
substantially equal to half the thickness of the sandwich 

material. 
A method according to claims 1-7, wherein a mold is used 
which comprises a flat bottom and sides, whilst the corners 

are rounded. 
A method according to claims 1-8, wherein a mold is used 
of a shape corresponding to any one of Figures 1-14. 
A method according to claims 1-9, wherein during the 
deformation an accessory which may or may not be intended to 

be incorporated into the edge is present in the mold. 
A method according to claims 1-10, wherein the edge of 
the sandwich material is first compressed while being heated, 

so as to form a flange, and subsequently this flange is 
introduced into an at least partially rounded mold at a 

temperature at which it is thermoplastically deformable, so 
that the flange is rolled up, and, finally, the sandwich 

material is allowed to solidify. 
A sandwich material comprising at least one edge finish 
obtained by the use of the method according to any one of 

claims 1-11.
