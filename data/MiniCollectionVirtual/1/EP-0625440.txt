<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for fastening an axle to a suspension arm comprising a cylindrical tube forming an axle, and a cradle (15) fixed to the suspension arm (3) and intended to receive the cylindrical tube (1), the said cradle (15) including two cheeks partially surrounding the cylindrical tube (1) and each terminating in a peak (30). The cylindrical tube (1) includes at least one assembly element (21) coming to bear on and interacting with at least one of the peaks (30) of the cradle (15) so as to prevent any rotational movement of the cylindrical tube (1) relative to the cradle (15). The invention also relates to a method for fixing an axle to a suspension arm by means of a device according to the invention.

Device for fastening an axle to a suspension arm comprising a cylindrical
tube (1) having an axis (A) and forming an axle, and a support bracket (15) fastened

to the suspension arm (3) and intended to receive the cylindrical tube (1), the said
support bracket (15) including two cheeks (151,152) partially surrounding the

cylindrical tube (1) and each ending in a ridge (30,40), the cylindrical tube (1)
including at least one plate (21,22,23) fastened to the tube (1) and forming a relief

with respect to the external surface of the tube (1), characterized in that the plate (23)
or the plates (21,22) have two bearing faces and the ridges (30,40) of the support

bracket (15) each have a bearing face, the bearing faces of the plate (23) or the plates
(21,22) and the bearing faces of the ridges (30,40) being facing each other and having

hollow and projecting shapes, as seen in a transverse direction with respect to the
axis (A) of the tube (1), so as to form a matched profile, the bearing faces of the plate

or the plates coming to bear on the ridges of the support bracket, and interacting with
each other so as to prevent any axial and rotational movement of the cylindrical tube

(1) with respect to the support bracket.
Fastening device according to claim 1, characterized in that each one of the
plates (21) forming the assembly element of the tube (1) has at least one recess (36),

the perimeter of this recess (36) making it possible to fasten the plate (21) to the tube
(1) by a weld along the perimeter of the recess (36).
Fastening device according to claim 1, characterized in that each one of the
plates (206,207) forming the assembly element of the tube (1) is fastened to the tube

(1) by screwing or bolting.
Fastening device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the bearing faces of the assembly element (21) of the tube (1) and of the

corresponding ridge (30) of the support bracket (15) each extend over two levels and 
in that their shape allows the assembly element (21) and the ridge (30) to be fitted

together.
Fastening device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the bearing faces (33,34) of the plate (21) and of the ridge (30) of the support

bracket (15) are bevelled.
Fastening device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that it comprises a clamp (18,19) intended to interact with a fastening plate (37) to

which it is fastened by at least one bolt (38,39) in order to hold the cylindrical tube
(1) on the support bracket (15).
Method of fastening an axle to a fastening arm, characterized in that it
comprises the following steps :


placing in the fitting position a cylindrical tube which has a longitudinal axis and
forms an axle;
placing in position two pairs of plates each forming an assembly element of the
tube, so that each of the pairs of plates is located close to a corresponding end of the

tube and so that each of the two pairs of plates is situated substantially diametrically
opposite and symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tube;
fastening the plates to the cylindrical tube;
placing a support bracket, held so that the cheeks of the support bracket points
downwards, onto the cylindrical tube so that the bearing faces of the cheeks bear on

the corresponding bearing faces of the assembly elements of the tube;
putting in place assembly means which are intended at least partially to surround
the axle and the suspension arm and acting upon these means in order to fasten the

axle to the suspension arm.
