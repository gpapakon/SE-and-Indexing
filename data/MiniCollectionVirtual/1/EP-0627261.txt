<ABSTRACT>
A tube (10) for partitioning a pre-selected phase 
of a sample of liquid having a plurality of phases of 

differing densities has a smaller diameter at one end 
(40). In use, a sample of liquid is passed through the 

first end of the tube and into a first chamber (20) of 
said tube. The first chamber is separated from a second 

chamber (21) located at a second opposed end of the tube 
by a separation device (19) slidably engaging the 

interior surface of the larger diameter part of the tube 
in an essentially fluid-tight manner and has a flow-restriction 

orifice (29) therein to permit fluid flow 
communication between the first and second chambers under 

the influence of force. The phases are then ordered 
within the tube using e.g. axial centrifugation. The 

volume of the first chamber (20) is reduced by movement 
of the separation device within the tube, such that one 

phase of the liquid in the first chamber flows through 
the flow-restriction orifice and into the second chamber. 

The method is monitored using the section of the tube 
that has the smaller diameter, which is transparent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phase-separation
tube and its use in the separation into phases of a
sample of liquid, including colloidal suspensions, having
a plurality of phases of differing densities and optical
characteristics, and especially for the separation of one
phase of the liquid sample from the remainder of the
liquid in a manner that minimizes contamination of the
phases and contamination of a phase of the liquid with
the liquid per se. The invention is especially useful in
the separation of blood into components thereof, for
example for purposes of testing and analysis of blood
components, while minimizing contamination of a separated
phase by the whole blood. The tube is a double-ended
tube that is particularly adapted for sensing the
separation of phases.Diagnostic tests frequently require separation of a
patient's whole blood sample into components, especially
cellular portions from non-cellular portions e.g. serum
or plasma from cells. For instance, plasma is obtained
from anticoagulated blood and still contains all of the
coagulation proteins, whereas serum is obtained from
clotted blood with the proteins being retained with the
clot and red blood cells. Samples of whole blood are
typically collected by venipuncture through a special
cannula or needle attached to a syringe or an evacuated
collection tube. The sample of blood that is to be
separated into components is typically drawn, using a
needle, through a penetrable self-sealing elastomeric
closure or other stopper into an evacuated tube.
Separation is then accomplished e.g. by rotation of the
tube in a centrifuge.The centrifuge may be a conventional centrifuge e.g. 
a swinging bucket or a fixed angle centrifuge, as the
different components of the whole blood have different
densities, as described in US-A-4 152 269.
Alternatively, the centrifuge may be an axial
centrifuge i.e. a centrifuge in which separation of the
phases is achieved by rotation of the tube about its
longitudinal axis i.e. axial rotation, as described in
US-A-4 828 716 (= EP-A-0285076). In the latter
process, the blood sample is introduced to the tube
through a cap assembly that consists of a pierceable
closure and a separator that has a one-way valve. The
tube is then rotated about its longitudinal axis; the
heavier cellular phase lines the tube wall and thereby
separates from the lighter non-cellular (plasma or
serum) phase. Once separation has been achieved, an
axial probe penetrates the pierceable closure, detaches
the separator from the closure and
