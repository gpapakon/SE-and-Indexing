<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for converting heat energy to mechanical energy with greater efficiency. According to the method, heat energy is applied to a working fluid in a reservoir (12) sufficient to convert the working fluid to a vapor and the working fluid is passed in vapor form to means (16) such as a generator for converting the energy therein to mechanical work. The working fluid is then recycled to the reservoir (12). In order to increase the efficiency of this process, a gas (He) having a molecular weight no greater then the approximate molecular weight of the working fluid is added to the working fluid in the reservoir (12) and separated from the working fluid downstream from the reservoir.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of converting 
heat energy to mechanical energy utilizing a working fluid, 
particularly for, but not necessarily limited to generating 
electricity. In order to perform useful work, energy must be 
changed in form, i.e., from potential to kinetic, heat to 
mechanical, mechanical to electrical, electrical to 
mechanical, etc. The experimentally demonstrated equivalence 
of all forms of energy led to the generalization of the first 
law of thermodynamics, that energy cannot be created or 
destroyed, but is always conserved in one form or another. 
Thus, in transforming energy from one form to another, one 
seeks to increase the efficiency of the process to maximize 
the production of the desired form of energy, while minimizing 
energy losses in other forms.  
 Mechanical, electrical and kinetic energy are energy 
forms which can be transformed into each other with a very 
high degree of efficiency. This is not the case, however, for 
heat energy; if we try to transform heat energy at a 
temperature T into mechanical work, the efficiency of the 
process is limited to 1-T0/T, in which T0 is the ambient 
temperature. This useful energy which can be transformed is 
called exergy, while the forms of energy which cannot be 
transformed into exergy are called anergy. Accordingly, the 
first law of thermodynamics can be restated that the sum of 
exergy and anergy is always constant. Moreover, the second law of thermodynamics which 
states that processes proceed in a certain defined direction 
and not in the reverse direction, can be restated that it is 
impossible to transform anergy into exergy. Thermodynamic processes may be divided into the 
irreversible and the reversible. In irreversible processes, 
the work done is zero, exergy being transformed into anergy. 
In reversible processes, the greatest possible work is done. Energy conversion efforts are based upon the second 
law, to make the maximum use of exergy before it is 
transformed into anergy, a form of energy which can no longer  
 
be used. In other words, conditions must be created to 
maintain the reversibility of processes as long as possible. The present invention is concerned with the 
conversion of heat energy to mechanical energy, particularly 
for the generation of electrical power, the process which 
presents the greatest problems with regard to efficiency. In 
the processes, heat is transferred to a working fluid which 
undergoes a series of temperature, pressure and volume 
variations in a reversible
