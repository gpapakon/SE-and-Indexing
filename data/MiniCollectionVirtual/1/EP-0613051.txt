<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an exposure method for 
transferring, using an optical system for illuminating 

a mask (12) having patterns to be copied onto a substrate (5) 
and a projection optical system (8) for projecting images 

of the patterns to the 
substrate through the projection optical system by 

means of scanning the mask and the substrate 
synchronously relative to the projection optical 

system. The method comprises the steps of providing 
a plurality of measuring marks on the mask formed 

along a relative scanning direction, and providing a 
plurality of reference marks (6) formed on the substrate stage 

corresponding to the measuring marks, respectively, 
moving the mask and the substrate synchronously in the 

relative scanning direction to measure successively a 
displacement amount between the measuring marks on the 

mask and the reference marks, and obtaining a 
correspondence relation between a coordinate system on 

the mask and a coordinate system on the stage 
according to the displacement amount.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of exposing
and an apparatus therefor. More particularly, the present
invention relates to an exposure apparatus of, for example,
a slit scanning exposure type and an exposure
method advantageously applicable to such
apparatus.Projection type exposure apparatus has been used in
manufacturing semiconductor devices, liquid crystal
displays and thin-film magnetic heads through a
photolithography process, in which patterns of a
photomask or a reticle (hereinafter, referred
generally to as "reticle") are transferred to the surface of
a substrate (wafer, glass plate, etc.) coated with a
photosensitive coating.The conventional projection type exposure apparatus
commonly used is a reduction projection type exposure
apparatus (stepper) that moves individual shots on the wafer
successively to an exposing field of a projection optical
system to reproduce pattern images of the reticle on the
shots using a photographic step-and-repeat process. In the typical steppers, a wafer coordinate
system corresponds to a reticle coordinate system
(reticle alignment).Some steppers comprise an alignment microscope of
an off-axis type provided at one side surface of the
projection optical system to detect a position of the
alignment mark (wafer mark) formed as a correspondence
to each shot on the wafer. In such a case, the shot
on the wafer is determined within the exposing field
of the projection optical system according to the
position of the associated wafer mark detected on the
alignment microscope. Accordingly, so-called base line
amount should be obtained previously that represents a
distance between a reference point (such as an
exposure center) within the exposing field of the
projection optical system and a reference point in an
observing field of the alignment microscope of the off-axis
type.The reticle alignment and the base line
measurement are disclosed in detail in, for example,
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 4-324923
(corresponding to U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 872,750
(filed on April 21, 1992)).In recent years, fine patterns for the
semiconductor devices require resolution of the
projection optical system to be improved. To improve 
the resolution, exposing light may be shifted to a
shorter wavelength or alternatively, the numerical
aperture of the projection optical system may be
increased. In any event, it has been difficult to
maintain an image quality (such as distortion and
image plate deformation) on the entire exposing field
with a predetermined accuracy
