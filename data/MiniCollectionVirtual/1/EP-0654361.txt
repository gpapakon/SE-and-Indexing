<ABSTRACT>
A clip for holding together paper, bank notes or the like, having an essentially U-shaped bow (10) which has a first and a second limb (12,14) which limbs are connected to each other by a connecting web (16), the two limbs (12,14) bounding a gap (18) between them for receiving the paper, the bank notes or the like, is improved in its usefulness in that the first limb (12), with its free end (20) resiliently against the inner side (22) of the second limb (14), forms with the latter a first pressure point (D1) and has a tongue (24) which projects from the surface of the first limb (12) in the direction towards the second limb (14), whose free end (26) faces the connecting web (16), and which, resiliently against the inner side (22) of the second limb (14), forms with the latter a second pressure point (D2).

<CLAIMS>
A clamping device for holding together paper, bills
or the like, comprising


a substantially U-shaped clip (10) having
first and second legs (12, 14) which are connected to each
other by a connecting web (16),
wherein the two legs define an intermediate space (18)
between them for receiving the paper, bills or the like,

and
wherein the first leg (12), with its free end (20), resiliently
forms on the inner side (22) of the second leg (14) with

the same a first pressing location (D1), and
includes a tongue extending away from the surface of the
first leg (12) in the direction of the second leg (14), the

free end (26) of said tongue (24) facing the connecting web
(16), and resiliently forming on the inner side (22) of the

second leg (14) with the same a second pressing location
(D2), and
the connecting web (16), the first leg (12), and the second
leg (14) are made of spring steel and the first leg (12
) and
the second leg (14) show a substantially rectangular outline

in plan view,

characterized in that
the tongue (24) is shaped from the surface area of the
first leg (12) and has a width of about one third of the

width of the first leg (12), with edges of equal width extending
on both longitudinal sides of the tongue (24) that

form the first leg (12).
The clamping device as defined in claim 1, characterized
in that the first pressing location (D1) and/or the 

second pressing location (D2) extend/s in a line substantially
transversely with respect to the longitudinal extension

of the clamping device.
The clamping device as defined in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the second leg (14) extends beyond the

first leg (12), as seen in longitudinal extension of the
clamping device, and the first leg, in the area of its free

end (20), has a first head portion (28) which is bent upwardly
with respect to the second leg (24), wherein, in

the inoperative position, the first head portion 28, at the
free end (20) of the first leg (12), defines an angle with

the second leg (14) of about 10° to 80°, preferably
about 40°.
The clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the connecting web (16)

between the first leg (12) and the second leg (14) has a
cross-section of an approximately semicircular shape and

constitutes an integral connection of the first leg (12)
and the second leg (14).
The clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the tongue (24) is at

its free end (26) provided with a second head portion (32)
which is bent upwardly with respect to the second leg (14),

wherein, in the inoperative position, the second head portion
(32) at the free end (26) of the tongue (24) defines an angle

with the second leg (14) of about 10° to 80°.
The clamping device as defined in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the second leg (14)

is provided at the outer surface (34) such as to receive
a relief, picture or other article (A, G, T, 40), or has

fixed to it a plate (36) provided with an engraving, print,
enameling, or the like. 
The clamping device as defined in the preceding claim,
characterized in that an etui (40) is mounted to the second

leg (14) which is adapted to receive at least one card-like
article (K).
The clamping device as defined in the preceding claim,
characterized in that the etui (40) is formed of two

spaced-apart plates (42, 44) which are connected to each
other at three edges (40a, 40b, 40c) either to form an

integral member or by a frame (46), said frame (46) being
a one-part or multiple-part grooved section.
The clamping device as defined in the preceding claim,
characterized in that the grooved section has a substantially

U-shaped cross-sectional shape and two grooves (52,
54) for receiving one plate (42, 44) each, and preferably

at least one groove (56) for receiving the card-like
article (K).
The clamping device as defined in the preceding claim,
characterized in that the grooved section is formed of two

fitted grooved ledges (46a, 46b) being substantially
U-shaped in cross-section, in which a plate (42, 44) is

received between the outer side of one leg (46b', 46b''),
each, of the inner grooved ledge (46b) and the inner side

of one leg (46a', 46a''), each, of the outer grooved ledge
(46a).
The clamping device as claimed in the preceding claim,
characterized in that the inwardly positioned grooved ledge

(46b) has a web (58) between its two outer legs (46b',
46b''), said web (58) and the two legs (46b', 46b'')

defining two grooves (56a, 56b).
The clamping device as defined in any one of claims
8 to 11, characterized in that the frame (46) and the plates

(42, 44) are made of metal, preferably aluminium, chromium-plated,
silver-plated or gold-plated (perforated) steel sheet

material.
