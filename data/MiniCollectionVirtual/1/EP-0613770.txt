<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an oriented multilayer polyolefin film which comprises a base layer essentially containing polypropylene, and at least one heat-sealable top layer. The heat-sealable top layer contains from 0.1 to 0.5 % by weight of SiO2 which has been organically aftertreated and has a mean particle diameter of from 2 to 6  mu m, preferably from 4 to 5  mu m. The ratio between the mean particle diameter and the top layer thickness should be in the range from 3 to 11. The invention also relates to a process for the production of the multilayer polyolefin film and to the use of the film.

<CLAIMS>
An oriented, multilayer polyolefin film comprising 
a base layer which essentially contains polypropylene, 

and at least one heat-sealable outer layer 
which contains from 0.1 to 0.5% by weight of SiO
2
, 
wherein the SiO
2
 has been subjected to organic 
aftertreatment and has a coating which contains 0.5-5% 

of an aliphatic carboxylic acid, and wherein the 
SiO
2
 has a mean particle diameter of from 2 to 6 µm, 
where the ratio between the mean particle diameter 

and the outer layer thickness is to be in the range 
from 3 to 11. 
A multilayer polyolefin film as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the aliphatic carboxylic acid is an 

aliphatic hydroxydicarboxylic acid or an aliphatic 
hydroxytricarboxylic acid or stearic acid. 
A multilayer polyolefin film as claimed in claim 1 
and/or 2, wherein the SiO
2
 has a mean particle 
diameter of from 2 to 5 µm, preferably 4 µm. 
A process for the production of a multilayer polyolefin 
film as claimed in claim 1, in which the 

melts corresponding to the individual layers of the 
film are coextruded through a flat-film die, the 

coextruded film is taken off over a take-off roll 
whose temperature is between 80 and 110°C, the film 

is stretched biaxially with a longitudinal stretching 
ratio of from 4:1 to 7:1 and a transverse  

 
stretching ratio of from 8:1 to 10:1, and the biaxially 

stretched film is heat-set, if desired corona-treated 
and subsequently wound up. 
A method of using a multilayer polyolefin film as 
claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3 as a 

packaging film. 
A method of using a multilayer polyolefin film as 
claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3 for 

printing. 
A laminate comprising a multilayer polyolefin film 
as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3 and paper 

or cardboard or at least one further film made from 
a thermoplastic.
