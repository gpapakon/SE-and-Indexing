<ABSTRACT>
A device is disclosed for cultivating mushrooms (14), in particular champignons, on a substrate (10) for the mycelia (11) from which grow the fruiting bodies (13). A harvesting surface is provided with a surface material (1) which cannot be penetrated by the mycelia (11), which lies on the substrate (10) and has slot-like passages (2) provided at predetermined spots through which the mycelia (11) can grow in order to form the fruiting bodies (13) on the side of the surface material (1) opposite to the substrate (10). An integrated water supply is provided to generate the required humid microclimate on the side where the fruiting bodies grow. In order to ensure an automatic harvest, a scraping rail (15) scrapes away the mushrooms (14) which have reached a desired size, by moving with respect to the harvesting surface, and leaves undamaged the smaller fruiting bodies, so that they can continue to grow.
