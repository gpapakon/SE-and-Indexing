<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for the angularly rigid support of a vertical partition wall (2) on a room wall (1). For this purpose, provision is made for a corner connector bar (9) which is fixed between a first connecting point (7) on the top edge (2a) of the partition wall (2) and a second connecting point (8) on the room wall. The effective length of the corner connector bar 9 can be adjusted for fine adjustment of the angular position of the partition wall (2).

An arrangement for mounting a fixed, vertical, straight
partition wall (2, 21), in particular in a shower compartment,

on a wall (1) of a room, in which the partition wall (2, 21) is
fixed approximately at a right angle to the wall (1) of the room

by a vertical edge, and in which a strengthening, diagonally
arranged corner connecting rod (9) connects a first, fixed

connection point (7), situated at a spacing from the wall (1) of
the room, at the upper edge of the partition wall (2, 21) to a

second connection point (8) on the wall (1) of the room, which
second connection point is located at a spacing from the point

(6) at which the partition wall (2, 21) is fixed to the wall (1)
of the room, characterized in that the corner connecting rod (9)

is fixed to the wall (1) of the room by way of setting means (9b,
12), in that that end (9a) of the corner connecting rod (9) which

is situated in the region of the second connection point (8) is
provided with an internal thread (96) into which a setting screw

(12) is screwed for the fine adjustment of the angular position
of the partition wall (2, 21) with respect to the wall (1) of the

room, the head (12a) of which setting screw may be positioned on
the wall (1) of the room after adjustment has taken place.
An arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the head (12a) of the setting screw (12) may be suspended in a

clip (11) fixed to the wall (1) of the room and may subsequently
be fixed in position, in particular by screws.
An arrangement according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the setting means (9b, 12) may be covered

by a cap (8a) which may be pushed in particular onto the clip
(11) fixed to the wall (1) of the room.
An arrangement, according to one or more of the preceding
claims, in a shower compartment which has a short, fixed 

partition wall (21) and a swivel door (21) hinged to the free end
thereof by swivel bearings (23), characterized in that the corner

connecting rod (9) serves to stabilize the upper swivel bearing
(23) and the first connection point (7) is situated in the region

of the upper swivel bearing (23).
An arrangement according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the corner connecting rod (9) is arranged

in the interior of the shower compartment (2, 3; 21, 22) and in
that a short hand-towel rail (10, 10a) is arranged outside the

shower compartment, between the first connection point (7) and
the fixing point (6) on the wall (1) of the room.
An arrangement, according to one of more of the preceding
claims, in a shower compartment, characterized in that the corner

connecting rod (9), extending from the second connection point
(8) to the first connection point (7) in the interior of the

shower compartment (2, 3), continues beyond the first connection
point (7) and is guided outside the shower compartment as a

bracket-shaped portion (10) in the form of a hand-towel rail as
far as the fixing point (6) on the wall of the room.
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding
claims, having a plate, the upper edge of which is frameless, as

a partition wall (2), characterized in that the corner connecting
rod (9) is fixed at the first connection point (7) by means of

a clamping or adhesive connection on the upper edge (2a) of the
plate,
An arrangement according to Claim 7, characterized in that
a two-part clamping device is provided, which has a bow-shaped

receiving part (7a) and a cover (7b); in that the bow-shaped
receiving part (7a) is placed astride the upper edge (2a) of the

plate (2), two limbs (14) covering the plate (2) on either side;
in that the cover (7b) has two downwardly pointing clamping limbs

(16) which come to lie on either side of the plate (2) and are
covered by the two limbs (14) of the bow-shaped receiving part 

(7a); and in that fixing screws, which screw the cover (7b) onto
the bow-shaped receiving part (7a), press the clamping limbs (16)

simultaneously inwards onto the plate (2) from both sides.
An arrangement according to Claim 8, characterized in that
the bow-shaped receiving part (7a) has on the upper side an

upwardly open semi-circular depression (13) for supporting the
corner connecting rod (9) of circular cross-section; and in that

the cover (7b) has a downwardly open semi-circular depression

(13) for pressing on the corner connecting rod (9).
An arrangement according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized in
that the clamping limbs (16a) are provided on their clamping

faces (16a) with an adhesive tape adhering on both sides.
