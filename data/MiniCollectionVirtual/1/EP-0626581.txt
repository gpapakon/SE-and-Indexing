<ABSTRACT>
A low power integrated current source (ICS) for monitoring the voltage at 
an input terminal (10) includes a current source (11) and a network of current mirror 

circuits coupled to the current source (11), to the input terminal (10) and to an output 
terminal. The circuit monitors the input voltage by comparing the input current with a 

reference current determined by the current source (11). The current mirror network 
responds to a predetermined voltage (current) at the input terminal (10) to switch the 

output voltage at the output terminal (14) from a first voltage level to a second voltage 
level. The ICS voltage monitor circuit limits the maximum value of the input current as 

the input voltage increases beyond a given voltage level thereby limiting the power 
dissipation. The trip voltage can be reset by merely changing the reference current 

supplied by the current source (11)or by changing the value of an input resistor whose 
purpose is to convert the input voltage into an input current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for monitoring a high voltage
and, more particularly, to a voltage level detection circuit that has the ability to limit
the input current to a predetermined value and thereby limit the power dissipated despite
an increase of the high voltage being monitored.The present invention particularly relates to a voltage monitor circuit comprising:
an input terminal for receiving a voltage to be monitored,an output terminal at which a voltage is derived indicative of the voltage to be monitored,a current source,a current mirror comparison means for comparing a current derived from the current source with
a current determined by the voltage to be monitored thereby to derive at its output the voltage
indicative of the monitored voltage, andmeans coupling said output terminal to said output of the current mirror comparison means.A voltage monitor circuit of this type is known from European Patent
Application EP-A-0 174 736.There are a wide variety of circuits available to monitor or detect the
level of an input voltage. Many of these conventional voltage level detection circuits use
a resistor voltage divider as a basic building block. The voltage detection circuit
compares the voltages at nodes along the voltage divider against a reference voltage that
can be derived by means of a transistor chain.This type of voltage detection circuit is subject to various limitations, one
of which is the relatively high level of power dissipated in the resistive voltage divider.
This power is wasted and thus reduces the overall efficiency of the voltage detection
circuit. Another disadvantage of the resistor voltage divider type detection circuit is that
the current dissipated will increase with the level of the input voltage being monitored.A voltage level detection circuit of this type is described in the U.K.
Patent Application, GB 2030398A in the name of Musa et al. This published patent
application utilizes a constant voltage reference generator consisting of three field effect
transistors connected in series across the terminals of a DC voltage supply whose
voltage level is to be monitored. The voltage reference generator provides a constant
output voltage which does not vary with variations of the monitored power supply
voltage. A resistor voltage divider is also connected across the terminals of the DC
power supply voltage. Three comparator circuits each have one input connected to the
output of the voltage reference generator and second inputs connected to respective
nodes
