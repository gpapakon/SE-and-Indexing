Use as aqueous machining fluid of a composition
comprising at least one fatty substance and at least

one cyclodextrin.
Use according to claim 1, characterised by the
tact that the composition comprises from 5 to 99.5%,

preferably from 30 to 99% and still more preferably
from 50 to 95% of fatty substance, and from 0.5 to

95%, preferably from 1 to 70% and still more
preferably from 5 to 50% of cyclodextrin, these

percentages being expressed by weight on a dry basis.
Use according to anyone of claims 1 and 2,
characterised by the fact that the composition

contains an amount of water comprised between 22 and
99%, preferably between 30 and 99% and still more

preferably between 35 and 98%.
Use according to anyone of claims 1 to 3,
characterised by the fact that the composition is

prepared by vigorous stirring after addition of water
and eventually after addition of some additives, of at

least one fatty substance and of at least one
cyclodextrin.
Use according to anyone of claims 1 to 4,
characterised by the fact that the composition is in

the form of an emulsion.
Process for processing worked pieces, notably
metallic pieces, characterised by the fact that the

step of machining of the worked pieces is carried out
with simultaneous flooding of the active part of the

tool with a composition such as used according to
anyone of claims 1 to 5. 
Process according to claim 6, characterised by
the fact that the used composition is recovered as

machining fluid at the end of the machining operation,
that said composition is allowed to stand for the time

necessary for separation of the phases to take place,
that each of the phases is recovered, filtered in

order to remove the suspended impurities and finally
recycled according to an appropriate regeneration

processing.
