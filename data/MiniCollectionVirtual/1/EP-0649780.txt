<ABSTRACT>
An ABS for an all wheel-driven vehicle is described in which the wheel slip is included as an instability criterion. The gradient of the reference speed which is required for this and determined by the wheel speed is limited, when the vehicle is accelerating, to the measured vehicle acceleration when the wheel acceleration is higher than the vehicle acceleration.

<CLAIMS>
Anti-lock brake control system for a vehicle
which travels, at least at certain times, with all-wheel

drive, in particular by switching on blocking mechanisms,
containing wheel sensors for determining the wheel

speeds, an evaluation circuit to which the signals of the
wheel sensors are fed and a brake pressure control unit

which, on the basis of the wheel movement behaviour of
the wheels, controls the brake pressure with the effect

of avoiding blocking of the wheels, the wheel slip being
used in the control, for which a reference speed which is

approximated to the speed of the vehicle is formed, a
vehicle acceleration sensor being provided and the

reference speed being determined or supported by the
wheel speed when the wheels of the vehicle are not

decelerated or are only decelerated in accordance with
the deceleration of the vehicle, characterized in that

the acceleration of the wheels is determined and is
compared with the acceleration of the vehicle supplied by

the vehicle acceleration sensor, and in that the characteristic
curve of the reference speed is limited to the

value of the acceleration of the vehicle when the
acceleration of the vehicle is exceeded by the acceleration

of the wheels.
Anti-lock brake control system according to Claim
1, characterized in that the limiting is performed in the

region of 0 to 0.35 g.
