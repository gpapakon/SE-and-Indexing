<ABSTRACT>
A sphingoglycolipid represented by general formula (I), which can be isolated from a microbial cell of the genus 
Sphingomonas
 
and can be used as a B cell activator because it has a mitogenic activity for B cells, wherein Q represents hydrogen or a 

specified sugar chain, and R represents C₁₈-sphinganyl or 13,14-cis-methylene(or unsaturated)-C₂₀-sphinganyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel
glycosphingolipid, GSL-2, having an immune-activating activity.Glycosphingolipids are substances present in the
outer layers of animal cells, etc. and are considered to
have a role to play in recognition mechanism.On the other hand, Gram negative bacteria have
an outer membrane composed of lipopolysaccharides,
proteins and phosphoric acid in the cell surface layer
thereof, and perform an exchange operation between the
inside and outside of a cell through the membrane.
Accordingly, lipopolysaccharides are present commonly
in all Gram negative bacteria and are considered to be
a substance essential to the bacteria. However, it
has been found that a bacterium known as Pseudomonas
paucimobilis which is an aerobic Gram negative bacterium
and which is one of the opportunistic infectious bacteria
contains no 3-hydroxy aliphatic acid which is known as a main
fatty acid component of lipopolysaccharides. Recently, it has
been proposed that the above bacterium be designated
as Genus Sphingomonas since the bacterium contains a
glycosphingolipid as a microbial cell lipid and, in
addition, many other taxonomical characteristics of the
bacterium are different from those of the typical bacteria
of the Genus Pseudomonas. Sphingomonaspaucimobilis is
expected to contain quite specific lipopolysaccharides.An object of the present invention is to obtain a
novel glycosphingolipid having a useful biological activity
by isolating a glycolipid from the above-described bacteria,
and analyzing its chemical structure and studying biological
activities thereof. The present inventors have succeeded in isolating
and identifying the object novel glycosphingolipid by
using an appropriate combination of treatment steps such
as extraction of the cell membrane of the bacteria of
the Genus Sphingomonas with organic solvents, and column
chromatography and the like.Fig. 1 is a graph showing the results obtained
by extracting each of the freeze-dried microbial cells
obtained in Example with chloroform/methanol (C/M) (2:1,
v/v), extracting the residue of the microbial cells with
C/M (1:3, v/v), and analyzing the C/M (1:3, v/v) extract
fraction by thin layer chromatography;Fig. 2 is a graph showing the results of analysis
by thin layer chromatography of a microbial cell lipid of
each of the freeze-dried microbial cells and purified GSL;Fig. 3 is a graph showing the results of high-voltage
paper electrophoretic analysis using a 4N HCl hydrolyzate of
purified glycolipid (GSL-2);Fig. 4 is a graph showing
