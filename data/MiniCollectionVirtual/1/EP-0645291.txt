<ABSTRACT>
A three position solenoid controlled valve (20) comprising: 
a housing (21) having first, second and third ports (22, 

23, 24); first and second valve bodies (26, 29) for 
bringing the first and second ports (22, 23) into and out

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to three 
position solenoid controlled valves and more particularly, 
to a three position solenoid controlled valve suitably used 
for a brake fluid pressure control device such as an antiskid 
brake control device. Generally, in antiskid control, a pressurizing 
mode, a holding mode and a depressurizing mode in which 
liquid pressure of wheel cylinders for wheels of a motor 
vehicle is increased, held and reduced, respectively are 
changed over in accordance with skid state of the wheels so 
as to control liquid pressure of the wheel cylinders. In order to produce the above mentioned pressurizing 
mode, the holding mode and the depressurizing mode, 
a structure is proposed in which an inlet valve formed by 
a two port and two position solenoid controlled selector 
valve is provided between a master cylinder of the motor 
vehicle and each of the wheel cylinders and a discharge 
valve formed by a two port and two position solenoid 
controlled selector valve is provided in a return path 
returning from each of the wheel cylinders to the master 
cylinder through a reservoir, etc. On the other hand, a single three position solenoid 
controlled valve capable of producing these three 
modes is known. For example, such a single three position 
solenoid controlled valve is proposed in Japanese Patent  
 
Laid- Open Publication No. 49-83028 (1974). In this known 
three position solenoid controlled valve, a slider 2 is 
slidably provided in a liquid chamber 1d of a housing 1 
having first, second and third ports 1a, 1b and 1c. 
Meanwhile, an electromagnet 3 is mounted on the housing 1. 
Valve bodies 4A and 4B are provided in the liquid chamber 
1d so as to be movable relative to the slider 2. The 
slider 2 is urged rightwards in Fig. 1 by a first spring 5, 
while a second spring 6 is compressed between the valve 
bodies 4A and 4B. A stopper 7 is slidable relative to the 
slider 2 and a third spring 8 is compressed between the 
stopper 7 and the slider 2. When this three position solenoid controlled 
valve is used for antiskid control, the first port 1a is 
connected with the master cylinder, the second port 1b is 
connected with each of the wheel cylinders and the third 
port 1c is connected with the return path. Meanwhile, by 
changing amount of electric power supplied to the electromagnet 
3 so as to control urging force (electromagnetic 
force) applied to the slider 2 by the electromagnet 3, the 
pressurizing mode, the holding mode and the depressurizing 
mode are

A three position solenoid controlled valve (20, 60, 70, 
80) comprising: 


a housing (21, 61, 71, 81) which has first (22), second 
(23) and third (24) ports; 
a first valve body (26, 63, 73, 83) which is slidable in 
the housing (21, 61, 71, 81) so as to bring the first (22) and 

second (23) ports into and out of communication with each 
other; 
a first urging means (28) for urging the first valve body 
(26, 63, 73, 83) in a direction for bringing the first (22) 

and second (23) ports into communication with each other; 
a second valve body (29, 75, 86) for bringing the second 
(23) and third (24) ports into and out of commmunication with 

each other; 
a second urging means (30) for urging the second valve body 
(29, 75, 86) in a direction for bringing the second (23) and 

third (24) ports out of communication with each other; and 
an electromagnetic urging means (25);
characterized
 by 
a single movable member (31, 65, 74, 85) that is urgeable 
by an electromagnetic force of said electromagnetic urging 

means (25) to slide in said housing (21, 61, 71, 81) in the 
direction of sliding of said first val
ve body (26, 63, 73, 
83);
 
the arrangement being such that:
 
   when the electromagnetic force of the electromagnetic 

urging means (25) is set at zero said single movable member is 
in a setting permitting the urging force of the first urging 

means (28) to cause the first valve body (26, 63, 73, 83) to 
bring the first (22) and second (23) ports into communication 

with each other and the urging force of the second urging 
means (30) to cause the second valve body (29, 75, 86) to 

bring the second (23) and third (24) ports out of 
communication with each other;
  
 

   when the electromagnetic force of the electromagnetic 
urging means (25) is set at a first predetermined value, said 

single movable member (31, 65, 74, 85) is moved by the 
resulting magnetic force to a setting causing the first valve 

body (26, 63, 73, 83) to slide against the urging force of 
said first urging means (28) to a setting bringing the first 

(22) and second (23) ports out of communication with each 
other; while permitting the urging force of the second urging 

means (30) to continue to cause the second valve body (29, 75, 
86) to keep the second (23) and third (24) ports out of 

communication with each other;
 
   when the electromagnetic force of the electromagnetic 

urging means (25) is set at a second predetermined value 
larger than the first predetermined value, said single movable 

member (31, 65, 74, 85) is caused by the resulting increased 
magnetic force to slide said first valve body (26, 63, 73, 

83) further against the urging force of said first urging 
means (28) to a setting maintaining said first (22) and second 

(23) ports out of communication with each other; and to cause 
said second valve body (29, 75, 86) to slide against the 

urging force of said second urging means (30) to a setting 
placing said second (23) and third (24) ports in communication 

with each other;
 
   the first valve body (26, 63, 73, 83) being formed with a detour 

(26c, 63d, 65d, 73a, 83d, 85b) for allowing communication of 
working fluid between opposite ends of the first valve body in 

the sliding direction of the first valve body regardless of 
the position of said single movable member (31, 65, 74, 85) in 

the housing such that a force based on a liquid pressure 
applied to one of the opposite ends of the first valve body 

(26, 63, 73, 83) in the sliding direction of the first valve 
body from the first and second ports and a force based on a 

liquid pressure applied to the other of the opposite ends of 
the first valve body from the first (22) and
  
 

second (23) ports eliminate each other, and wherein: 

(a) the first valve body (26, 73) is formed by a plunger 
slid in the housing (21, 71) substantially in a liquid-tight 

state and brings the first (22) and second (23) ports out of 
communication with each other through relative displacement 

between the housing (21, 71) and a land portion (26f, 73e) of 
the first valve body (26, 73); or 
(b) the first valve body (63, 83) is formed by a plunger and 
an annular sealing member (64, 84) made of elastic material is 

provided on the first valve body (63, 83) or on said housing

communication with each other,
 
   wherein the urging force of the first urging means (28) is 

set to be larger than the urging force of the second urging
