conjugated dienes possibly mixed with vinyl-substituted 

aromatic products in a radicalic emulsion polymerization 
process using a redox initiator, in particular 

radicalic emulsion polymerizations of butadiene possibly

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
obtaining the shortstopping of polymerizations of 
conjugated dienes possibly mixed with vinyl-substituted 
aromatic products in a radicalic emulsion polymerization 
process using a redox initiator. This method 
enables the production of polymers without the formation of nitrosamines 
(NA) and/or their precursors. In particular this 
invention relates to the radicalic emulsion polymerization 
of butadiene possibly mixed with styrene or 
acrylonitrile with the use of a shortstopping agent so 
that the polymers produced have no nitrosamines (NA) 
and/or their precursors. The presence of nitrosamines in rubber products is 
well-known (Kautschuk and gummi Kunststoffe 42, pages 
16-21, no.1, 1989. B. Spiegelhalder and co., 7th Inter. 
Meeting on analysis and formation of N-Nitroso Compounds; 
Tokyo; Sept. 20-Oct. 1, 1981). Their origin is  
 
the result of chemical interactions which occur during 
the vulcanization phase of rubber. In particular 
nitrosamines are obtained from dialkylamines (or 
precursors) by reaction with nitration agents. Dialkylamines 
may already be contained in the rubber or 
released by additives used for the vulcanization of the 
mixtures. It has been shown [J.M. Fajen and co.; 
Science, N.Y. 205, 1262 (1979), R. Preussman and co. 
Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 174, 217 (1981)] that the 
nitrosamines thus formed can be released from the end-product: 
into the air in the working environment during 
production and then inhaled; into food or saliva (eg. baby feeding-bottle) and 
then swallowed. It is known in literature [P.N. Magee and J.M. 
Barnes; Adv. Cancer Res. 10, 163 (1967). H. Druckey; 
Xenobiotica 3, 271 no.5 (1973)] that most probably it 
is not the nitrosamines themselves that are carcinogenous 
but their metabolites resulting from the enzymatic 
hydrolysis in organisms. 
The health organizations of various countries have 
taken the problem in hand and legislative regulations 
have already been made concerning the presence of 
nitrosamines and their precursors in Germany [Technische  
 
Regaln fuer Gefahrstoffe (TRGS 552); Bundesarbeitblatt 
9, 81 (1988)] and in the United States 
(Federal Register, vol. 49, no.252, Dec.1984). 
German legislation in particular (see above) has 
provided for measurements of the NA level in the air of 
working environments (max. limit allowed 2.5 micrograms/m3) 
and defined a list of 12 N-nitrosamines 
classified as cancerogenous substances group (A2), i.e. 
substances which at present have proved to be
