<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling a digital cordless telephone apparatus formed of a plurality
of master stations (1-3) and a plurality of remote stations (4-8) is provided. This

method comprises the steps of making a telephone call among the master stations and
the remote stations by transmitting and receiving digital data with different timings, and

setting a common system access code in respective master stations so as to make a
telephone call become possible among all of the master stations and the remote stations,

wherein other master station receives a control signal included in the system access code
transmitted from a main master station (1) of a plurality of the master stations (1-3), a

control signal from other master station is transmitted in synchronism with a reception
timing of the control signal and the remote station turns on and off a power supply of

its reception unit on the basis of the control signal transmitted thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cordless telephone 
apparatus and a control method thereof and, more particularly, 
to a digital cordless telephone apparatus in which a telephone 
communication is made among master stations and remote stations 
and a control method thereof. A digital cordless telephone apparatus is arranged as 
shown in FIGURE 1 of the accompanying drawings. As shown in 
FIGURE 1, a master station 1 serving as a base station is 
connected to a telephone line network (not shown) and includes 
an antenna 1a to make a telephone communication between it and a 
remote station. As shown in FIGURE 1, there are prepared a 
plurality of remote stations, i.e., three remote stations 4, 5 
and 6 which can make a call among them and the master station 1. 
The remote stations 4, 5 and 6 include antennas 4a, 5a and 6a, 
and a radio transmission is made possible among the antenna 1a 
of the master station 1 and the antennas 4a, 5a, 6a of the 
remote stations 4, 5, 6. When the user (telephone subscriber) makes a telephone 
call between each of the remote stations 4, 5 and 6 and the 
master station 1 or the caller connected to the master station 1 
through the telephone line network (not shown), the remote 
station transmits a connection control signal of a predetermined  
 
format to the master station 1 side and also transmits audio 
data that was converted into digital data in a time division 
manner between it and the master station 1 to make a telephone 
call. Digital cordless telephone apparatus employ the TDD 
system (time-division double system) or TDMA/TDD system (time-division 
multiplexing access/time-division double system) in 
which a transmitted signal and a received signal are the same in 
frequency and a transmission is carried out in a so-called ping-pong 
fashion. In the case of the TDD system, as shown in FIGURE 2A, 
one channel or one frequency is divided into a transmission slot 
T and a reception slot R from a time standpoint. The 
transmission slot T and the reception slot R are alternately 
repeated and a guard time (not shown) is provided between the 
transmission slot T and the reception slot R. Each of a 
duration of the slots T and R is set to be 1 millisecond and the 
guard time is set to be several 10s of microseconds. Portable 
telephones (remote stations) use the transmission slot T to 
communicate with the base station (master station) and the 
reception slot R to receive a signal from the base station. In the case of the TDMA/TDD system, as shown in FIGURE 
2B, when a
