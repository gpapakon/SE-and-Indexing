<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
organopolysiloxane. More specifically, the invention 
relates to a novel phthaloyl halide-functional 
organopolysiloxane and to a process for preparing same. 
The invention further relates to the use of the above 
organopolysiloxane in the preparation of novel 
organopolysiloxane-grafted polybenzobisoxazoles. Macromonomers have been the subject of active 
investigation over the last several years, a 
macromonomer being a polymer or oligomer that contains 
a polymerizable functional group. Graft copolymer with 
a well-defined branch length and number of branches can 
be synthesized through the use of a macromonomer as 
the branching element in the graft copolymer. General 
reviews in this area are available, for example, 
Makurom onomaa no Kagaku to Kogyo [The Chemistry and 
Technology of Macromonomers], edited by Y. Yamashita, 
IPC (1989); Y. Kawakami, Kobunshi, volume 37, p. 264 
(1988); and Y. Chujo, Kobunshi, volume 39, p. 452 
(1990). Most of the macromonomers known to date have 
the vinylphenyl group, acryloyl group, or methacryloyl 
group as their terminal polymerizable group, and these 
are used mainly for chain-growth polymerization. 
However, macromonomers for step-growth polymerization 
have been reported: these contain a terminal diol, 
dicarboxylic acid, dicarboxylic acid ester, diamine, 
phenol, and so forth. See, for example, Tezuka et al., 
Polymer, volume 30, p. 553 (1989); Tezuka et al., 
Macromolecules, volume 24, p. 122 (1991); Kawakami et 
al., Polym. Bull., volume 25, p. 521 (1991); Okawa et 
al., Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Hei 1-132634; 
Nagase et al., Makromol. Chem. Rapid Commun.,  
 
volume 11, p. 185 (1990); Nagase et al., Japanese 
Patent Application Laid Open Number Hei 1-185327; and 
K. M. Snow, et al., Canadian Patent 2,025,289. However, neither organopolysiloxane carrying 
phthaloyl halide as its polymerizable group nor a 
process for the preparation of such an 
organopolysiloxane have been reported up to now. Such 
a polysiloxane would be useful for the synthesis of 
novel polymers having organopolysiloxane side chains 
and a main chain of polyester, polyarylate, polyamide, 
polybenzobisoxazole, and so forth. Furthermore, 
aromatic polymers, such as aromatic polyesters, 
aromatic polyamides (aramides), and aromatic 
polyimides, have begun to occupy an important position 
as high-performance polymers due to their high 
mechanical strength, heat resistance and solvent 
resistance, (see, for example, High-Performance 
Aroma
