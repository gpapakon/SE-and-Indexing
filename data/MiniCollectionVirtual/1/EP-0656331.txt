<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
preparing a carbon/carbon composite material.Carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix
composite materials are light in weight and have
thermal resistance and, further, they are superior in
sliding movability, strength, breaking toughness and
thermal conductivity etc., so that they are used as
industrial materials such as heat resistant materials,
brake materials and furnace materials.In the preparation of the carbon fiber
reinforced/carbon composite materials, firstly carbon
fibers are molded or carbon fibers together with pitch
or a thermoset resin as a binder are molded, they are
then carbonised to make preforms and the preform so
made are subsequently densified.Although there has been proposed a method for
completing said preform and densification in one step,
the obtained carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix
composite materials will be insufficient in strength
and sliding movability and will be unable to be used
as heat resistant structural materials for space 
applications or brake materials even if they may be
used as furnace materials and the like. Therefore,
carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix composite
materials adapted for applications requiring
sufficient strength and sliding movability are
generally prepared by firstly making preforms thereof
and then densifying the preforms.A CVD (chemical vapor deposition) method has
hitherto been most widely used as a process of
densifying such preforms, but said method takes a long
period of time and incurs high costs. On the other
hand, there is a method for impregnating preforms with
a thermosetting resin such as a phenolic resin or a
furan resin and carbonizing the resin so impregnated,
but said method also takes a long period of time for
carbonization of the resin and is not preferable in
view of a cost because of its low yield, and the
method has a disadvantage that the obtained composite
material is low in thermal conductivity.Furthermore, there is a method which
comprises using pitch for densification, but said
method generally has disadvantages that pitch is
carbonised via its liquid phase so as to be bubbled
during carbonization by gases produced by thermal
cracking, etc. at normal pressure with the result that
the obtained carbonised material is markedly low in
bulk density. Additionally, the yield of carbonized 
material obtained at this time is also low. In order
to prevent bubbling during carbonization and a
decrease in yield of carbonized material, there has
been proposed a method for carbonization

A method for preparing a carbon/carbon composite material
comprising the steps of:


impregnating a carbon preform obtained by molding carbon
fibers and/or raw materials for carbon fibers or by molding

these fibers and a carbon matrix precursor comprising pitch
and/or resins with carbonaceous pitch having a

carbon/hydrogen atomic ratio of less than 1.60, and
carbonizing or carbonizing and graphitizing the thus

carbonaceous pitch used, and the relative density of

carbonized pitch obtained under said gas pressure is a value
obtained by dividing (A) the bulk density of a product

obtained by carbonization treating carbonaceous pitch alone 
under the same gas pressure as that used in the step of

densification by (B) the true density of said carbonized
carbonace
ous pitch, and further
