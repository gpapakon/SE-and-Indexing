<ABSTRACT>
An injection comprising a 2-((2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl)-benzimidazole compound or a salt thereof having antiulcer activity and an aqueous solvent added with no nonaqueous solvent, wherein the pH of the injection is not less than 9.5 and not more than 11.5, and an injection kit comprising the following (a) and (b), wherein (a) and (b) are adjusted such that the pH upon dissolution of (a) in (b) is 9.5 - 11.5: (a): a lyophilized product of an alkaline aqueous solution of a 2-((2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl)benzimidazole compound or salt thereof having antiulcer activity; (b): an aqueous solvent added with no nonaqueous solvent. The injection of the present invention is void of the necessity to lower pH so as to prevent hemolysis and local irritation, and to add a nonaqueous solvent to an aqueous solvent for dissolution so as to prevent concomitant degradation of dissolution property. Accordingly, the injection of the present invention can secure solubility sufficient for formulation into preparation and safety for the human body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an injection of 2-[(2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]benzimidazole 
compound or a salt thereof 
having antiulcer activity, particularly sodium salt of 
omeprazole and to an injection kit thereof, which are used in 
clinical fields. The 2-[(2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]benzimidazole compounds 
such as omeprazole or lansoprazole are potent antiulcer agents, 
and are used as pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration. 
Further, the injections thereof have recently 
developed. As an injection of omeprazole, there has been known an 
injection prepared by dissolving sodium salt of omeprazole in 
sterilized water, filtering and lyophilizing the solution to 
give a lyophilized product, and then dissolving the lyophilized 
product in a mixture of polyethylene glycol 400 for injection, 
sodium dihydrogenphosphate and sterilized water (Japanese Patent 
Unexamined Publication No. 167587/1984). Also, an injection prepared by dissolving a lyophilized 
product of an alkaline aqueous solution of a 2-[(2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]benzimidazole 
compound having antiulcer activity 
such as lansoprazole in a mixture of (a) acid, and (b) at least 
one of ethanol, propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol  
 
(Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 138213/1990). In general, the pH of injection is preferably about 4-8, 
and a pH above 9 has a probability of causing hemolysis and 
local irritation. In the case of the 2-[(2-pyridyl)methylsulfinyl]benzimidazole 
compound or a salt which may be hereinafter referred 
to as "benzimidazole compound or salt thereof" represented by 
sodium salt of omepazole, it shows a solubility of the level 
permitting formulation into preparation, in water in an alkaline 
range of pH 9.5 or above, whereas it shows extremely low 
solubility in water at a pH of not more than 9, thus rendering 
formulation into preparation very difficult. While the benzimidazole compound or salt thereof is stable 
in the alkaline range, it poses a problem in that its stability 
decreases with the lowering pHs. For this reason, it has been employed in conventional 
injections of benzimidazole compound or salt thereof such as 
sodium salt of omeprazole to add an acid such as hydrochloric 
acid or sodium dihydrogenphosphate to the solution to keep the 
pH from neutral to weak basic, and to further add a nonaqueous 
solvent such as polyethylene glycol, ethanol or propylene glycol 
in order to obtain a certain level of solubility in such pH 
range. Yet, these injections pose problems of local
