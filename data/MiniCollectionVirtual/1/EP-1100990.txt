<ABSTRACT>
Cellulosic fiber-containing fabrics are made wrinkle resistant by a durable press wrinkle-free process which comprises treating a cellulosic fiber-containing fabric with formaldehyde, a catalyst capable of catalyzing the cross-linking reaction between the formaldehyde and cellulose and a silicone elastomer, heat-curing the treated cellulose fiber-containing fabric, preferably having a moisture content of more than 20 % by weight, under conditions at which formaldehyde reacts with cellulose in the presence of the catalyst without a substantial loss of formaldehyde before the reaction of the formaldehyde with cellulose to improve the wrinkle resistance of the fabric in the presence of a silicone elastomeric softener to provide higher wrinkle resistance, and better tear strength after washing, with less treatment.

 DURABLE PRESS/WRINKLE-FREE PROCESSCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application claims benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of prior pending application 60/046,298 filed May 13, 1997.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of inventionThis invention relates to a durable press/wrinkle-free process for cellulosic fiber-containing fabrics and more particularly to a process which permits high treatment level amounts of formaldehyde and catalysts to impart wrinkle resistance to the cellulosic fiber-containing fabrics while reducing the loss in both tensile and tear strength normally associated with such treatment processes.Description of related artThere are a number of known process for treating cellulosic fiber- containing fabrics, such as cotton-containing fabrics, to make them wrinkle- free. These treatment processes include resin or polymer treatment of the fabric, but these are costly and unsatisfactory. Another process for treating cellulosic fiber-containing products relies on formaldehyde to provide durable crosslinking of the cellulose molecules and to thereby impart durable crease 

resistant and smooth drying characteristics to these products. However, problems have been encountered with the known processes. A simple, reproducible, completely satisfactory low-cost formaldehyde durable press process has not yet been achieved. It has long been known to treat cellulosic materials with formaldehyde, as is evidenced by U.S. Patent Number 2,243,765. This patent describes a process for treating cellulose with an aqueous solution of formaldehyde containing a small proportion of an acid catalyst under such conditions of time and temperature that the reaction is allowed to approach its equilibrium. It is further stated that, in carrying out this process, the proportion of the solution of formaldehyde to the cellulose must be at least such that the cellulose is always in a fully swollen state. It is also stated that the time and temperature of the treatment with the solution of formaldehyde and acid catalyst will vary with one another, the time required increasing rapidly as the temperature diminishes. When it is desired, the product may be isolated by washing and drying; preferably at a temperature of about 212°F. The products obtained according to this process are said to show no increase in wet strength and possess a high water imbibition, an increased resistance to creasing and a slight increase in affinity to some direct dyes. In recent years additional methods have been devised for treating cellulosic

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A durable press process for cellulosic fiber- containing fabrics comprising treating a cellulose fiber-containing fabric with formaldehyde, a catalyst capable of catalyzing the crosslinking reaction between formaldehyde and cellulose, and an effective amount of silicone elastomer, heat curing said treated cellulosic fiber-containing fabric under conditions at which formaldehyde reacts with cellulose in the presence of the catalyst and silicone elastomer, without a substantial loss of formaldehyde before the reaction of the formaldehyde with the cellulose to improve the wrinkle resistance of the fabric while reducing loss in tear and tensile strength.
2. The process of claim 1 wherein the heat curing is at a temperature which prevents the substantial loss of formaldehyde during curing.
3. The process of claim 1 wherein the heat curing step is carried out at a high enough temperature to allow the crosslinking step to occur before sufficient formaldehyde leaves the fabric and affects the process.
4. The process of claim 1 wherein the fabric being cured has a moisture content of more than 20% by weight.
5. The process of claim 2 wherein the heat curing is over a temperature of from 100°F to 350°F.
20 

6. The process in claim 2 where the heat curing is carried out in the preferred range of 250 to 325°F.
7. The process of claim 1 wherein said fabric is heat cured by gradually increasing the temperature.
8. The process of claim 5 wherein the heat curing is over a temperature of from 100°F to 300°F.
9. The process in claim 1 where the formaldehyde is in the form of an aqueous solution of formaldehye having a concentration of 0.5% to 10%.
10. The process in claim 1 where the preferred formaldehyde concentration range is from 1.5% to 7% on the weight of the fabric.
11. The process of claim 1 , wherein the fabric is 100% cotton shirting.
