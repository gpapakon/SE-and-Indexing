<DESCRIPTION>
 T-CELL MEMBRANE INDUCING FACTORSField of the InventionThis invention relates to the field of immunology and immunological diseases. More specifically, the invention provides therapeutically useful proteins for immune deficiency disorders.Background of the Invention and Information Disclosure StatementMany diseases are characterized by the suppression, dysfunction or deficiency of T cells. Diseases which involve the suppression of T cells include HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, malaria, and cholera. Diseases which involve the dysfunction of T cells include ataxia-telangiectasia, Hodgkin's disease, hypogammaglobulinemia, and chronic lympnocytic leukemia. Diseases which are characterized by a deficiency of T cells include thymic aplasia, Di George's syndrome and lepromatous leprosy.One of the actions of T cells is to induce monocytes to produce cytokines or perform other inflammatory functions (Amento, E. P. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:5307 (1982); Amento, E. P. et al., J. Immunol. 134:350 (1985);Knight, E. Jr. et al., J. Immunol. 146:2280 (1991); Halpern, M.T. et al., J. Clin. Immunol. 11:1 (1991)). Several T cell surface molecules have been implicated in the induction of IL- lβ production by monocytes. These include membrane-associated IL-lα (Dinarello, C.A., et al., J. Immunol. 139:1902 (1987)), membrane-associated TNFα (Weaver, C.T., et al., J. Immunol. 142:3469-3476 (1989)), CD2 (Webb, D.S., et al.. Science 249:1295-1297 (1990)), and CD69 (Manie, S. et al., FASEB J. 5:A1455 (1991)). A need exists to control the ability of T cells to induce cytokine production by monocytes. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages.SUBSTITUTESHEET 

Summary of the InventionThe present invention relates to the identification, characterization and purification of the T cell surface proteins which induce monocytes to produce cytokines and methods for purifying said T cell surface proteins.The purified T cell-derived proteins which are designated as TMIP-1 and TMIP-2 have the following properties. They a) are naturally located on the plasma membrane of T cells; b) induce monocytes to produce cytokines; c) are substantially present on activated but not substantially present on unactivated T cells; d) are sensitive to trypsin; e) are solubilized by 3-( (3-cholamidopropyl)- dimethylammonio)-l-propanesulfonate (CHAPS); f) bind to Q-Sepharose resin at approximately pH 8.5 and can be eluted from the Q-Sepharose with1.) 0.12 to 0.18 M NaCl (TMIP-1), or 2.) 0.28 to 0.36 M NaCl (TMIP-2);
