<ABSTRACT>
A hinge for a motor vehicle door or hatchback 
door comprising two fastening elements (3,4) attached 

to the vehicle bodywork (1) and to the door (2) 
respectively, said elements being movably 

connected by a first connecting rod (6), and a second 
connecting rod (12) facing the first and in which the 

first connecting rod comprises a control and stop 
device (23) for the door movement, and the second 

connecting rod comprises a pin (19) capable of working 
together with said control and stop device (23) during 

use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a hinge for a motor 
vehicle door or hatchback door, in particular for 
rear doors of commercial vehicles. It is well known that the main problems of 
hinges of the above type lie in the angle they 
allow the door to open, and in the reliability of 
the stop device once the door has been 
completely opened (for ex. GB-A-2 196 053). In some cases the door can also be required to 
stop in more than one position in order to 
facilitate the loading and unloading of goods. The hinges which are commonly in use at present 
do not allow the door to open wider than 180Â°, 
since its rotation is hindered by the motor 
vehicle side to which it is attached. Furthermore, in order to hold the door open, 
stop devices positioned outside the motor vehicle 
are used, said body is often damaged by the 
blows, however involuntary, to which it is 
subjected. The aim of this invention is to overcome the 
above mentioned drawbacks. This and other aims are achieved by the 
invention, the subject of which is a hinge for a  
 
motor vehicle door or hatchback door capable of letting 
the door complete a rotation angle of more than 180 
degrees, comprising two fastening elements attached 
respectively to the vehicle bodywork and the motor 
vehicle door, these elements being movably connected by 
a first connecting rod by means of two first rotation 
pins which are parallel and positioned at the ends of 
the connecting rod; a second connecting rod, facing the 
first one and being connected at its ends to said two 
fastening elements by means of two second rotation pins 
positioned parallel to said first pins, characterized 
in that the first connecting rod has, on its surface 
facing the second connecting rod, a control and stop 
device for the door movement and in that the second 
connecting rod has, on its surface connecting the first 
connecting rod, a small pin which is capable of working 
with said control and stop device during use in order 
to make it rotate. Further characteristics and advantages will become 
more clear from the following description in which 
reference is made to the attached drawings, supplied by 
way of example only, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a plan view of a hinge according to this 
invention in its open and closed positions; Fig. 2 is a cross section view of the invention along 
line II-II of Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a perspective view, partially cutaway, of the  
 
hinge according to the invention; Fig. 4 is a view of another embodiment of a detail of

<CLAIMS>
A hinge for a motor vehicle door or hatchback door 
capable of letting the door complete a rotation 

angle of more than 180 degrees, comprising two 
fastening elements (3, 4) attached respectively to 

the vehicle bodywork and the motor vehicle door, 
these elements being movably connected by a first 

connecting rod (6) by means of two first rotation 
pins (7, 9) which are parallel and positioned at 

the ends of the connecting rod; a second 
connecting rod (12), facing the first one and 

being connected at its ends to said two fastening 
elements by means of two second rotation pins (14, 

15) positioned parallel to said first pins, 
characterized in that the first connecting rod (6) 

has, on its surface facing the second connecting 
rod (12), a control and stop device (23) for the 

door movement and in that the second connecting 
rod has, on its surface connecting the first 

connecting rod (6), a small pin (19) which is 
capable of working with said control and stop 

device (23) during use in order to make it 
rotate. 
A hinge according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the control and stop device comprises a pair 

of toothed rollers (21, 22) contained inside the  
 

walls of the connecting rod, said rollers rotating 
on a pin (24) supported by the connecting rod and 

having seats for receiving said small pin (19) 
supported by the second connecting rod, said 

rollers being separated by toothed bushings (32, 
33) axially slidable along the pin (24), against 

said rollers (21, 22) under the action of an 
elastic element (36), whereby the respective 

toothings engage. 
A hinge according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the toothed rollers (21, 22) have limit stops 

(29, 30) which are capable of engaging with 
corresponding projections (40, 41) machined on the 

surface of said first connecting rod (6). 
A hinge according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the elastic element is a spring (36) which 

can be calibrated by means of a threaded ring nut 
(37) positioned on one of the toothed bushings 

(32). 
A hinge according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the first connecting rod (6) has a U-shaped 

section and is capable of containing the second 
connecting rod (12) and the control and stop 

element (23). 
A hinge according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said second connecting rod (12) is formed  

 
into two parts, a main connecting rod (50) and a 

secondary connecting rod (52) connected 
therebetween by means of a pin (55) enabling the 

two connecting rods to rotate with respect to each 
other. 
A hinge according to claims 1 and 6, characterized 
in that said pin (55) connecting the main 

connecting rod to the secondary one is secured to 
said control and stop element.
