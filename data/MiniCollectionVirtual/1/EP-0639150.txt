<ABSTRACT>
An aircraft cargo container adapted to provide blast attenuation in the event of an explosion within the container comprises panels (2, 3) of blast resistant material joined together by joint means (4, 5) which are adapted to provide a relatively rigid joint under normal handling conditions, but which provide a relatively flexible hinged joint capable of transmitting tensile loads between the panels under blast conditions. Additional reinforcement may be provided by a lattice of high tensile strength straps (6) substantially surrounding the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blast attenuating containers such as 
aircraft luggage containers. It is known to use blast attenuating materials in the 
construction of aircraft luggage containers in order to reduce the 
effects of the blast from a detonating or exploding device within the 
container. Indeed, Applicant's International Patent Application 
No.PCT/GB90/01724 (International Publication No.WO91/07337) 
describes such a container using blast attenuating materials in 
accordance with Applicant's co-pending International Patent 
Application No.PCT/GB90/01723 (International Publication 
No. WO91/07275). The container described in the first-mentioned 
patent application is preferentially weakened to ensure that the blast 
caused by an explosive device within the container is vented in a 
predetermined direction in order to limit the damage caused. An alternative approach, which relies to some extent on the 
expectation that only relatively small-scale explosive devices will 
escape detection by routine security screening procedures, is to 
endeavour to substantially contain the blast, and fragments from it, 
within the container. In either case, it is important to ensure that the parts of the 
container, if any, which are not preferentially weakened retain a 
degree of structural integrity throughout the blast in order to 
perform the desired blast absorbing and attenuating function.  
 Most aircraft containers in current use are of standardised 
construction, conforming to one or other of the International Air 
Transport Association's (IATA) specifications for Unit Load Devices. 
Such containers typically comprise a number of panels assembled on 
a rigid base and joined at their edges to form an enclosure. Whilst 
capable of withstanding normal handling loads, the panels and joints 
are not capable of effectively containing or attenuating a blast from 
an explosive device. According to the present invention, a blast attenuating 
container comprises a number of panels, at least one of which has 
blast attenuating properties, the panels being joined together to form 
an enclosure by joint means which provide a relatively rigid joint 
between the panels under normal handling loads, but which provide 
a relatively flexible hinged joint capable of transmitting tensile loads 
between the panels under blast conditions. The invention derives from the recognition that in order to 
effectively attenuate and hopefully contain the blast from a bomb 
detonating within the enclosure, it is important that the

<CLAIMS>
A blast attenuating container comprising a number of panels (51, 52), at least 
one of which has blast attenuating properties, the panels being joined together 

to form an enclosure by joint means (50), characterised in that said joint 
means (50) provide a relatively rigid joint between the panels (51, 52) under 

normal handling loads and provide a relatively flexible hinged joint capable of 
transmitting tensile loads between the panels under blast conditions. 
A blast attenuating container as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the joint means 
comprise a first and second component (63, 62), the first component (63) 

having sufficient stiffness to provide a rigid joint under normal handling 
conditions, but which is adapted to rupture or fracture under blast conditions, 

and the second component (62) providing a flexible tensile load-bearing joint 
between panels (51,52) following rupture or fracture of the first component 

(63). 
A blast attenuating container as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the second 
component (62) of the joint is encased within the first component (63). 
A blast attenuating container as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein the 
second component (62) comprises respective hinge members rigidly connected 

to the edges and/or corners of the panels (51,52) and mechanically hinged to 
one another. 
A blast attenuating container as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the joint means 
(50) is formed of a material which is rigid under normal handling conditions, 

but which is rupturable or deformable under blast conditions to provide a 
flexible tensile load-bearing joint between the panels. 
A blast attenuating container as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the joint means is 
formed of aluminium or fibre reinforced plastics composite material.  

 
A blast attenuating container as claimed in Claim 5 or 6, wherein the edge 
joint means (50) comprise a pair of parallel webs (53,54) angled to provide a 

corner between adjoining panels and spaced apart to provide a gap between 
them, the edges of each web being bonded and/or mechanically fastened to the 

edges of the panels (51,52). 
A blast attenuating container as claimed in Claim 7, wherein the angled inner 
web (53) of the joint means (50) if subtended by a third web (58) which 

provides rigidity for the joint under normal loads but which is adapted to
