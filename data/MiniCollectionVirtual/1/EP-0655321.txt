<ABSTRACT>
Tyre fabric for rubber-reinforcement includes a warp 
(2) having straight portions arranged in parallel 

with each other at predetermined intervals and a 
weft (100) woven with the warps. The weft comprises 

a pair of parallel portions (10) and a V-shaped 
connection portion (10a). The V-shaped connection 

portion (10a) which connects a pair of the portions 
with each other is provided in an edge portion of 

the tyre fabric for rubber-reinforcement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tire fabrics for
rubber-reinforce and more particularly to tire fabrics for
rubber-reinforce having a function of preventing concaves from
being generated on a region, of a side wall, corresponding to
a portion at which both ends of a carcass of tire are
connected with each other. The present invention relates to
a ply for tire-reinforce comprising the tire fabrics. The
present invention relates to a method of manufacturing the
tire fabrics for rubber-reinforce.A pneumatic tire having a radial construction in
which cords used as warps of the tire fabrics are disposed at
right angles with the circumferential direction of the tire
is manufactured in the following process. That is, a
plurality of the cords parallel with each other is rubberized
with topping rubber compounds, and the rubberized material is
cut at a right angle with the extended direction of the cords
to obtain a plurality of strips each having a predetermined 
length. In forming a carcass ply, two to 20 cords disposed
at an edge portion on either side of one of the cut strips are
overlapped on those disposed on an edge portion disposed on
one side of two different cut strips to be connected with the
cut strip. Then the carcass ply is rolled up. A belt layer,
tread rubber, side wall rubber are layered on the outer face
of the carcass ply and then, the tire that the above components
have been layered on the carcass ply is cured in a mold.Because the carcass ply is manufactured by the
above-described method, the number of cords present in the
strip-overlap portion is greater than that of cords present
in other portions. Thus, per cord, elongation stress is small
and thermal contraction is large and further, the strip-overlap
portion has a great rigidity. Hence, when internal
pressure is applied to the tire having the carcass ply, the
strip-overlap portion is expanded less than other portions.
As a result, portions of the side wall of the tire corresponding
to strip-overlap portions are recessed and thus, the
configuration of the tire itself becomes nonuniform and its
commercial value deteriorates greatly.Various inventions have been proposed to solve the
above-described problems. For example, there is disclosed in
Examined Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 4-14462, tire
fabrics comprising specific elongative cords provided in the
edge portion thereof; in Examined Japanese Patent Publication 
No. 63-48723, tire fabrics comprising polyester cords having
a low contraction coefficient provided in the edge

other of the parallel portions, the parallel
portions and the V-shaped connecting portion being

integrally formed, 
characterised in that
 if the
number of parallel portions (10) arranged in every

5cm length in the longitudinal direction of the
straight portion of the warp (2) is "P", and a

shortest length from a connection point (10b) at
which the end of the parallel portion is connected

to the connecting portion to an inflection point

the fabric, before being cured, comprises warps (2)
having straight portions arranged parallel with each

other spaced apart at predetermined intervals and a
weft (100) woven with the warps, the weft (100)

comprising a pair of parallel portions (10) arranged
adjacently and a V-shaped connection portion (10a),

the connecting portion extending from an end of one
of the parallel portions, being inflected at one of
