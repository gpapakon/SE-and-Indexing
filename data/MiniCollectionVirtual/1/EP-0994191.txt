<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hyperthermostable protease useful as an enzyme for industrial use, a gene encoding the same and a method of producing the enzyme by genetic engineering technique.A protease is an enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds in proteins. A number of such enzymes have been found in animals, plants and microorganisms. The protease is used as a reagent for laboratory use and as a pharmaceutical, as well as in industrial fields, for example, as an additive for a detergent, for processing foods and for chemical synthesis utilizing a reverse reaction. Therefore, it can be said that the protease is an extremely important enzyme for industries. Since high physical and chemical stability is required for a protease used in industrial fields, a thermostable enzyme is preferably used among others. Since proteases produced by bacteria of genus Bacillus exhibit relatively high thermostability, they are mainly used as proteases for industrial use. However, in search of a more superior enzyme, attempts have been made to obtain an enzyme from a microorganism growing at high temperature, for example, a thermophilic bacterium of genus Bacillus or a hyperthermophile.For example, a hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus is known to produce a protease (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 56:1992-1998 (1990); FEMS Microbiol. Letters, 71:17-20 (1990); J. Gen. Microbiol., 137:1193-1199 (1991)).In addition, a hyperthermophile, Pyrococcus sp. strain KOD1, is reported to produce a thiol protease (a cysteine protease) (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 60:4559-4566 (1994)). Hyperthermophiles of genus Thermococcus, genus Staphylothermus and genus Thermobacteroides are also known to produce proteases (Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 34:715-719 (1991)).The proteases from the hyperthermophiles as described above have high thermostability. Therefore, it is expected that they may be used in place of the thermostable proteases currently in use or in a field in which use of a protease has not been considered.However, most of the microorganisms producing these enzymes grow only at high temperature. For example, Pyrococcus furiosus needs to be cultured at 90-100°C. Culturing at such high temperature is disadvantageous in view of energy cost. Furthermore, the productivities of the proteases from the hyperthermophiles are lower than the productivities of the conventional microbial proteases. Thus, the methods for industrially producing the proteases from the hyperthermophiles have problems.By the way, production of an enzyme by genetic
