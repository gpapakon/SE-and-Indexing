<ABSTRACT>
A conversion system for converting easy-open can ends has 
an improved slide assembly capable of handling multiple 

conveyor belts with improved tension and vibration 
control. The slide assembly includes a stationary idler 

shaft (70) mounted transverse to the conveyor axis (14) on a take-up 
slide (10). At least two guide pins (80) extend from the shaft 

parallel to the conveyor axis. Each guide pin mounts a 
cylindrical bearing holder (82) thereon. The bearing holders 

are both pivotable and slidable on the guide pins. 
Springs (78) disposed in pockets (74) in the idler shaft (70) bias the 

bearing holders (82). The bearing holders each mount a drum (98) 
for rotation with the drum's axis parallel to the idler 

shaft. The pivoting of the bearing holders accommodates 
conveyor belt camber while the sliding permits tension 

adjustment and control.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to conversion systems
according to the preamble of claim 1
of the type
used to convert circular metal workpieces called shells
into can ends, especially easy-open ends. A conversion
system is basically a large press having cooperatively-engageable,
reciprocable upper and lower tooling. The
tooling has appropriate punches and dies which define a
plurality of stations wherein shells are progressively
converted into can ends. At least one endless conveyor
indexes the shells into and through the stations of the
tooling. Conversion systems typically have multiple rows
or lanes of stations so that multiple ends are formed on
each stroke of the press. US Patent 5,017,072
shows further details of the overall conversion system.The invention further relates to a method of reducing vibration
of a conveyor belt of a conversion system according to the
preamble of claim 11.The conveyor belt is an endless loop, usually made of
steel, and having openings in which the shells rest. The
conveyor revolves around head and tail pulleys. Usually
the head pulley is driven and the tail pulley is an
idler. The tail pulley is mounted on a slide assembly to
permit adjustment of the conveyor belt tension. Accurate
indexing of the shells requires proper tension on the
belt.Recent advances in tooling permit ends of differing
diameters to be made at the same time. That is, one lane
can be making one size end while an adjacent lane is
making a different size end. US-A-5 284 045,
entitled
'End Tooling for Multiple End Diameters', assigned to the
present assignee
discloses tooling of this type. Each lane in
the multiple-diameter type tooling requires its own
conveyor belt, with the openings therein sized for the
particular end being made. But the tension of multiple 
belts cannot be individually adjusted with the slide
assemblies of the prior art. Neither can conventional
pulleys allow sensing of belt breakage, should it occur.
Moreover, conventional pulleys will not adjust for the
individual camber of multiple belts. These problems are
addressed by the present invention.This invention is concerned with conversion systems for
making can ends and is particularly directed to a slide
assembly for mounting multiple pulleys for multiple
conveyor belts.A primary object of the invention is a slide assembly
having multiple pulleys.Another object of the invention is multiple pulley slide
wherein each pulley is individually slidable and
pivotable.Yet another object of the invention is a multiple pulley
slide for multiple
