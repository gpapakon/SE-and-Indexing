<ABSTRACT>
It includes an attenuator (20) upstream of the mixer (5), so as to apply signals of only about 70 volts rms to the latter. The preamplifier is then a very high-gain amplifier, typically of the order of 30 dB, which is followed by a level-limiting cell (24).

Transmission system for the transmit part of a
mobile terminal associated with a digital mobile radio

installation, said transmission system including a baseband
modulator (2) supplying I and Q paths (3, 4) in phase

quadrature from the digital input signal (1), a
mixer/frequency converter (5) possibly of moderate performance

and an amplifier (6) including a preamplifier (21) driving a
commercially available power amplifier (6) possibly of

moderate performance, characterised in that:

means (20) are provided for attenuating the amplitude
of signals on the I and Q paths in phase quadrature in order

to apply to said mixer (5) input signals at a lower level than
would otherwise be obtained from said modulator (2);
said preamplifier (21) is chosen to have a much higher
gain than the preamplifier (14) which would conventionally be

included in a like transmission system, but without said
attenuation means, and is also chosen to have a high

compression point; and
a level limiter and fixing circuit (24) is provided on
the output side of the preamplifier (21) and on the input side

of the power amplifier (16).
Transmission system according to claim 1
characterised in that said level limiting circuit (24) is a

peak limiter diode circuit (26).
Transmission system according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that said attenuator means comprise a

variable attenuator (20).
Transmission system according to any one of claims 1
to 3 characterised in that said preamplifier (21) has a gain

in the order of 30 dB.
