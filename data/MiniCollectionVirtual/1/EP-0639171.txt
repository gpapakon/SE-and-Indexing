<ABSTRACT>
A process for upgrading olefin feedstock containing a mixture of iso-olefin and linear olefin to produce tertiary-alkyl ether and high octane gasoline components comprising dimerized iso-olefin. Product recovery is integrated between primary and secondary reaction stages. In a preferred embodiment, a two stage etherification process employs a secondary solid acid regenerable catalyst bed to dimerize unconverted iso-butene in the debutanizer overhead stream of a conventional MTBE primary reactor stage. Both stages can utilize a regenerable acid catalyst such as ZSM-5 or Zeolite Beta for etherification and to upgrade unconverted alkenes and methanol from the primary stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ETHER PRODUCTION WITH STAGED REACTION OF OLEFINSThe present invention relates to a multi-stage process and apparatus for preparing al yl ethers in high yield. In particular, it relates to catalytic conversion of a mixture of alkene isomers by reaction with alkanol under etherification conditions, followed by selective oligomerization of unreacted iso-alkene from the primary stage. Recent efforts have been made in the field of gasoline blending to increase gasoline octane performance without the addition of deleterious components such as tetraethyl lead and benzene. It has been found that lower molecular weight unsymmetrical ethers such as MTBE and TAME can be added to Cb_-C1,Λ0 hydrocarbon-containing gasoline products in order to increase octane number. The research octane number (RON) of MTBE has been listed at 115 (Lander, E.P.. et al, "National Petroleum Refiners Association Annual Meeting", San Francisco, Calif., March 20-24, 1983). The blending octane number of MTBE has been calculated over various concentrations and some of the readings are: RON, 115-135; MON (motor octane number), 98-110; and (RON & M0N)/2, 106-122.5 (Pecci, G. et al, Hydrocarbon Processinσ. 1977, 56, 98). Blending octane number rises when MTBE concentration is decreased and saturates concentration of the base fuel is increased.Conventional etherification processing uses as catalyst a macroreticular cation exchange resin in the hydrogen form. An example of such a catalyst is "Amberlyst 15". A resin catalyst gives a high conversion rate but is unstable at elevated temperatures (above 90°C) . When overheated, the resin catalyst releases sulfonic and sulfuric acids. In addition leaching of acid substances from the resin 

 catalyst even at normal operating temperatures causes a reverse reaction - decomposition of ether products to starting materials - to occur upon distillation of ether product. Overall yield is thereby significantly decreased (see U.S. Patent No. 4,182,913).Etherification reactions conducted over a resin catalyst such as "Amberlyst 15" are usually conducted in the liquid phase below a temperature of about 90"C and at a pressure of about 1480 kPa (200 psig) . Equilibrium is more favorable at lower temperatures but the reaction rate decreases significantly. Also excess methanol appears to be required to achieve acceptable selectivity over "Amberlyst 15" (see Chu et al, Industrial Engineering and Chemical Research, Vol. 26, No. 2, 1987, 365-369).Some recent efforts in the field of etherification reactions have
