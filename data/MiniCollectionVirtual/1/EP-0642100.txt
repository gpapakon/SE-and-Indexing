plurality of images, each of the luminance I
p1xy
-I
pNxy
 of each of 
the pixel p
1xy
-p
Nxy
 positioned at the same coordinates (x,y) of N 
images P₁-P
N
 are compared with each of the predetermined 
threshold luminance T₁-T
N
 corresponding to images P₁-P

-I
pNxy
 
of the pixels p
1xy
-p
Nxy
 are all greater than the 
corresponding threshold T₁-T
N
 of corresponding image, the 
synthesized pixel p

image is determined by synthesizing the pixels p

predetermined synthesis ratio for each of the images P₁-P

. If 
the condition described above is not satisfied, the synthesized 

pixel p

 at the coordinate (x,y) of the synthesized image is 
determined by synthesizing with arbitrary synthesis ratio only 

the pixels having luminance less than or equal to the 
corres
ponding threshold T₁-T

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns methods and apparatus for the
synthesis of images to be utilized on the terminals of video
communication systems, especially those methods and apparatus
which are used for the sending and receiving through
communication lines of multiple images of writings or hand
movements on a desktop of multiple users separated into remote
locations. The images are synthesized, and with the use of
display apparatus, it is possible for user to point with one's
finger or pen and to write words at the desired location in the
writings on their respective desktops. Such apparatus would make
it possible to perform group work such as office work, design
work, or software design on the individual desktops of the
respective users.Up until now, there has been a video communication terminal
which is able to send and receive through communication lines
video images of hand movements on the desktops of multiple users
who are stationed at separate locations. The terminal offers a
shared drawing space in which each person's video image is
synthesized translucently, so that it is possible to see through.
Displayed on a monitor, it is possible for many people to
simultaneously give directions for the desired location on the 
video image by using a finger or a pen, as well as writing in
words (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No.
4-119,087).Fig. 24 shows a block diagram of the structure of a video
communication system which utilizes this kind of video
communication terminal. In Fig. 24, the two video communication
terminals 1a and 1b are able to communicate in two directions
through a communication line 2. The video communication
terminals 1a and 1b are each made up of video image input
apparatuses 3a and 3b, video image synthesis apparatuses 4a and
4b, display apparatuses 5a and 5b, and video image communication
apparatuses 6a and 6b respectively. The video image input
apparatuses 3a and 3b comprise video cameras, which take image of
each person's desktop, and, for example, output the video images
7a and 7b shown in Fig. 25. The video image synthesis apparatus
4a carries out a translucent synthesis, so that the images are
able to be seen through, of the video image 7a received directly
from the video image input apparatus 3a and the video image 7b,
which is received through the video image communication apparatus
6a and the communication line 2 from the video image
communication apparatus 6b, which in turn received the image from
the video image input apparatus 3b. In this way, the
