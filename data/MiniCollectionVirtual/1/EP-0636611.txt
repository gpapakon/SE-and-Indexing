<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intermediate products
for preparing optically active 1,4-dihydropyridine
derivatives which are useful as medicines for circulatory
organs such as hypotensors and vasodilators.Some compounds among optically active
1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives have been known to have a
calcium-competing activity, a vasodilating activity and a
vasodepressing activity, and such activities are known to
be lasting (Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res. 38(11), 1666(1988),
J. Med. Chem. 29, 2504(1986), Japanese Patent Publication
No. 30111/1982, European Patent No. 0424901), examples of
such compounds including(4S)2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic
acid (3S)-3-(1-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinyl)-ester
methyl ester having the following formula:

(YM-09730) (J. Med. Chem., 29, 2504 (1986)), and
(4S)-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic 
acid·3 (2-(4-(4-benzhydryl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl)ethyl)ester·5-methyl
ester having the following
formula:

(Chem. Pharm. Bull., 39, 108 (1991)) and their salts.Reportedly, 1,4-dihydropyridine compounds having
different carboxylic acid ester moieties at the 3- and 5-positions
of the dihydropyridine ring naturally have
asymmetric carbon atoms at the 4-position thereof, and
hence there are two kinds of optical isomers which are
different in pharmacological activity, in vivo behavior,
safety, etc. (K. Tamazawa et al., J. Med. Chem. Vol. 29,
2504 (1986), Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 30, 1559 (1991)).From the viewpoint that only one of the isomers that
is pharmacologically preferred is to be used as a medicine,
investigation has been made to develop a process for
preparing optically active 1,4-dihydropyridine compounds.As a general process for preparing the aforementioned
optically active 1,4-dihydropyridine compounds which are
useful as medicine, there has been known a process in which
a preferable ester radical is introduced into a (4R)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic
acid monoester represented
by general formula (II) 

wherein R4 is a lower alkyl group.As processes for preparing optically active
intermediates represented by general formula (II) above,
there have been known a chemical method (Shibanuma et al.,
Chem. Pharm. Bull., Vol. 28, 2809 (1980)), enzymatic
processes by Achiwa et al.(Tetrahedron Letters, 32, 5805
(1991) and EP474129) and by Charles J. Sih et al.
(Tetrahedron Letters, 32, 3465 (1991)).In the aforementioned chemical process, not only the
nitrogen atom on the 1,4-dihydropyridine ring must be
protected with
