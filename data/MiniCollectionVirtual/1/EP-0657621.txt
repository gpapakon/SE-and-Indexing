<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
system for measuring three-dimensional
displacement of a mass. More specifically, the invention
relates to a system suitable for measuring
three-dimensional displacement of a discontinuous
surface, such as a crack in a rock or a natural joint and
so forth.Conventionally, in fields of mechanical
engineering, civil engineering and so forth, a non-contact
type distance measuring equipment, such as a
laser type displacement gauge, or a contact type
displacement gauge employing a differential transformer
and so forth are used practically. Namely, these
measuring equipments performed high precision measurement
of a displacement of a mass as an object for measurement
(hereinafter referred to as measuring object) as a
relative displacement from a reference portion where
various displacement gauges are placed.Also, particularly in the field of civil
engineering and mining, or in the field of geophysics, 
measurement of displacement of a foundation, such as a
rock, is performed for appropriately evaluating behavior
of rock or crust. As a method for measuring the
displacement of the foundation, a measuring method
employing an extensometer is typically employed. Namely,
this method makes analysis of the displacement of the
foundation by setting a fixed measuring point within a
bore hole formed in the foundation, such as the rock, and
measuring a variation of a distance between the fixed
measuring point and a measuring point located at the
opening end of the bore hole on the earth by means of the
extensometer.However, when the displacement of the mass is
measured by the conventional measuring system and method,
the relative displacement from the reference portion
where the displacement gauge is located is merely
measured as a linear relative displacement. Therefore,
in order to measure the three dimensional displacement of
the mass, displacement measurements by means a plurality
of measuring equipments which are arranged three-dimensionally.
This makes installation of the measuring
equipments and collection of measured data complicate.Furthermore, in particular, when three-dimensional
behavior of the foundation is to be evaluated
by the extensometer, since the measuring method employing
the extensometer permits only evaluation of relative
linear displacement between two measuring points along an 
axis of the bore hole, it is inherent to three-dimensionally
arrange a plurality of bore holes to
perform multi-axes and multi-point measurement for three-dimensional
evaluation.
