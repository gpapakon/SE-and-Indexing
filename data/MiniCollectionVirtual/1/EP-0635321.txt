<ABSTRACT>
The low noise punch tool (17) of this application includes an upper 
surface pad (51) formed of a low noise material and disposed on an upper 

surface of a punch head (37) to be struck by a striker (25) of a punch 
press. Further, an elastic member (55) formed of a low noise material is 

interposed between the punch head (37) and a punch guide (43), and a 
ring (53) formed of a low noise material is interposed between the punch 

body (39,41) and the punch guide (43). The low noise punch tool (17) 
includes a lower surface pad (63) formed of a low noise material and 

attached to a lower surface of a stripper plate (45) provided at a 
lower end of the punch guide (43). The low noise material may be 

urethane. Yet further, the cutting edge (41a) provided at the lower end 
of the punch body (41) has preferably a shearing angle. This punch tool 

is advantageous in that the noises of the punch tool during punching is 
significantly reduced, and the structure thereof is simple.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a punch tool adapted to 
be mounted on a turret punch press, and in particular to a low 
noise punch tool which generates a low noise when punching a 
workpiece. Conventionally, a punch tool has been formed with a 
shearing angle in order to reduce punching noise generated 
when a workpiece is punched out by a turret punch press, see Sheet 
Metal Industries, Vol. 57, no. 8, pages 740-745. 
However, it is desired to further reduce the 
punching noise generated during the punching processing. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention 
to provide a low noise punch tool which can significantly 
reduce the punching noise, and is simple in structure. This object is achieved by the features as indicated in 
independent claim 1.  
 In another aspect of the present invention, the upper 
surface pad (51) and the lower surface pad (63) includes a 
plurality of cusp push members (65) arranged circularly at 
regular angular intervals on the upper surface of the punch 
head (37) and on the lower surface of the stripper plate (45), 
respectively. Fig. 1 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view showing an 
embodiment of a low noise punch tool according to the present 
invention; Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram showing the levels of 
noises generated when a workpiece is punched out; Fig. 3 is a partial longitudinal cross-sectional view 
showing another embodiment of the punch head of the punch 
tool according to the present invention; Fig. 4 is a plane view of the low noise punch shown 
in Fig. 3; and Fig. 5 is a front view showing a turret punch press on 
which the low noise punch tool according to the present 
invention is to be mounted. Embodiments of the low noise punch tool according to the 
present invention will be described in detail hereinbelow with 
reference to the attached drawings. Fig. 5 is a front view showing a turret punch press on 
which the low noise punch tool according to the present  
 
invention is mounted. In the drawing, the turret punch press 
1 is composed of a lower frame 3, a pair of columns 7 disposed 
on both sides of the lower frame 3 to provide a working area 
5, and an upper frame 9 formed integral with the pair of 
columns 7. A processing section 11 for punching a workpiece W, for 
instance, is provided on the left side of the working area 5. 
The processing section 11 is composed of an upper 
disk-shaped turret 13 rotatably mounted on the upper frame 9 
and a lower disk-shaped turret 15 rotatably mounted on the 
lower frame 3 an appropriate
