<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an introducer (100) for 
delivering into the vasculature at an angeological 

bifurcation where a blood vessel branches into two 
branched vessels a bifurcated endoluminal stent (10) or 

prosthesis (50;70;91) having a proximal portion 
(12;62;72;92) adapted to be disposed in said blood vessel 

and a distal portion (16;80;94) adapted to be disposed 
at least partially in one of said two branched vessels, 

said introducer comprising a tubular outer sheath (101) 
and a proximal portion pusher (102) slideably disposed 

at least partially within said outer sheath and adapted 
to engage said proximal portion (12;62;72;92) of said 

stent (10); characterised by a distal portion pusher 
(103) slideably disposed at least partially within said 

proximal portion pusher and adapted to engage said distal 
portion (16;80;94) of said stent (10). Said introducer 

may further comprise a balloon catheter (104) having a 
balloon attached thereto, disposed at least partially 

within said distal pusher portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kit for introducing to the
vasculature a stent or endoluminal prosthesis for use in a blood
vessel
as specified in the preamble of claim 1. Such a kit is known
from WO 89/08433.A stent is used to provide a prosthetic intraluminal wall e.g. in the case of a
stenosis to provide an unobstructed conduit for blood in the area of the stenosis. An
endoluminal prosthesis comprises a stent which carries a prosthetic graft layer of
fabric and is used e.g. to treat an aneurysm by removing the pressure on a weakened
part of an artery so as to reduce the risk of embolism, or of the natural artery wall
bursting. Typically, a stent or endoluminal prosthesis is implanted in a blood vessel
at the site of a stenosis or aneurysm by so-called "minimally invasive techniques" in
which the stent is compressed radially inwards and is delivered by a catheter to the
site where it is required through the patient's skin or by a "cut down" technique in
which the blood vessel concerned is exposed by minor surgical means. When the
stent is positioned at the correct location, the catheter is withdrawn and the stent is
caused or allowed to re-expand to a predetermined diameter in the vessel.EP 0508473 A2 discloses an introducer for delivering into the vasculature at
an angeological bifurcation where a blood vessel branches into two branched vessels
a bifurcated graft having a proximal portion adapted to be disposed in said blood
vessel and a distal portion adapted to be disposed at least partially in one of said two 
branched vessels, said introducer comprising a tubular outer sheath and pushing
means for delivering said graft into the vasculature. In particular, the introducer of
EP 0508473 A2 comprises a flexible capsule that is connected to one end of a tubular
member and is adapted to accommodate the bifurcated graft in a folded configuration
with one leg being folded back against a main body for delivery into the vasculature.
A balloon catheter shaft is slideably inserted through the capsule and carries a
stabilization button mounted in a fixed position on said catheter shaft, a
pre-determined distance from a proximal extremity of a balloon that is secured to a
distal extremity of the shaft. The stabilisation button is thus positioned near to the
major portion of the material forming the graft which is folded up within the capsule.
In use, the tubular member and capsule are retracted whilst the catheter shaft is
retained in a stationery position. As the tubular member and capsule are withdrawn,
