<ABSTRACT>
A heart stimulator (2), comprising an atrial electrode (8) 
in an atrium of a heart (4) and a ventricular electrode (12) 

in a ventricle in the heart (4), is described. In order to 
sense stimulated events in the heart, a detector (26) is 

connected to the electrodes (8, 12) in order to measure 
electrical heart signals between them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heart stimulator comprising
a pulse generator and an electrode system which
comprises an atrial electrode, arranged in an atrium of a
heart, and a ventricular electrode, arranged in a ventricle
of the heart, whereby stimulation pulses, generated by the
pulse generator, are delivered to the atrium via the atrial
electrode or to the ventricle via the ventricular electrode
for stimulating a heart response.In a dual chamber system of the above-described type, the
atrium and ventricle can be stimulated in a synchronous
sequence which emulates a natural heart cycle in a healthy
heart. In order to prevent the release of needless stimulation
pulses to the heart, the atrium and the ventricle can
be sensed for spontaneous activity. For example, if the
ventricle is sensed for spontaneous activity, ventricular
stimulation pulses are inhibited when a spontaneous ventricular
event (ventricular systole) is sensed. Such a system
is designated DVI. The DVI-system is further refined if
the atrium is also sensed for spontaneous activity. A sensed
spontaneous atrial event (atrial systole) would then inhibit
emission of an atrial stimulation pulse. This refined system
is known under the designation DDI. A heart stimulator is
designated DDD if it is devised for both triggering and
inhibiting according to spontaneous activity sensed in both
the atrium and the ventricle.A pacemaker for automatic detection of cardiac pacer evoked potentials is
disclosed in US-A-4 858 610. A further pacemaker is disclosed in US-A-4
729 376 including an automatic capture threshold determination system.EP-A-0 308 536 describes a heart stimulator which can stimulate
and sense both in the atrium and ventricle. The known
heart stimulator has two electrodes in the atrium (atrial
electrodes), two electrodes in the ventricle (ventricular
electrodes) and an indifferent electrode, consisting of the
heart stimulator's capsule. Stimulation and sensing of both  
the atrium and the ventricle can be achieved either between
an electrode and the capsule or between the two electrodes
in the respective chamber, i.e. atrial stimulation and sensing
between one atrial electrode and the capsule or between
two atrial electrodes and ventricular stimulation and sensing
between one ventricular electrode and the capsule or
between two ventricular electrodes.The electrodes are implanted in the heart on electrode
leads. For the known heart stimulator, a bipolar electrode
lead can be implanted in the atrium, and a bipolar electrode
lead can
