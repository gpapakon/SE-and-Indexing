<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for generating linear data from measurement values correlated to specific characterisitc values of a measurement object. The thus obtained measurement values are coded point by point and are stored in an oriented matrix. The individual elements of said matrix are iteratively tested for predetermined correlations, and the elements which satisfy the predetermined correlation are gathered into groups of point coordinates which define each a continuous line. The thus generated continuous lines are then graphically represented.

A process for fully automatically generating line data in which 
in a first process step measurement values which are correlated with 

specific characteristic values of a measurement object are acquired in a 
measurement point-wise manner by means of a measurement value sensor (1), 

in which in a second process step measurement value encoding of the 
measurement values acquired in the first process step is effected in a 

measurement point-wise manner, characterised in that said encoded 
measurement values are stored in an oriented matrix, wherein the 

association of a measurement point with an element of the oriented matrix 
is effected in dependence on the geometrical point co-ordinates 

represented by said measurement point, in which in a third process step an 
element of said oriented matrix, which functions as a start point, 

provides for identification of encoding differences between the encoding 
associated with the start point and the encoding of a respective 

comparison element of the oriented matrix, which is in a defined area 
around the start point, by deriving a difference signal (GD) representing 

the respective encoding difference, in which said difference signal (GD) 
is analysed to ascertain whether the encoding difference between said two 

elements of the oriented matrix corresponds to a predefined correlation, 
that with a given correlation an index signal (IS) is produced, by which 

said comparison element is provided with an index, and in which the 
substep sequence established by the above-indicated substeps of the third 

process step is iteratively repeated, wherein the start point of a new 
substep sequence is an element of the oriented matrix which is indexed in 

the preceding substep sequence, in which in a fourth process step a search 
run is performed over the indexed elements of the oriented matrix and the 

geometrical point co-ordinates of the measurement object which are
