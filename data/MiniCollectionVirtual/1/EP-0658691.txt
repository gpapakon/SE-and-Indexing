<ABSTRACT>
In an internal combustion engine having an exhaust-gas 
brake device (5,51) in exhaust-gas pipe (4) and an EGR device (7,8) 

which returns part of the exhaust-gas from the exhaust-gas 
pipe upstream from this exhaust-gas brake device to 

the air-intake manifold (2), a suitable exhaust-gas-brake 
force can be obtained by setting the opening pressure 

required to open the exhaust-gas valve (30) to a value which 
allows the production of a suitable exhaust-gas-braking 

force but lower than the opening pressure required to 
open the EGR control valve (8) of EGR device. As a result, 

when the exhaust-gas brake operates, the leakage of 
exhaust-gas into the air-intake manifold is eliminated, 

and the desired exhaust-gas-braking force is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an EGR 
(exhaust-gas recirculation) device of an internal 
combustion engine equipped with an exhaust-gas brake, 
and more specifically to an EGR device of an internal 
combustion engine equipped with an exhaust-gas brake, 
which can prevent an undesirable recirculation of the 
exhaust-gas through the EGR device when the exhaust-gas 
brake is operated. In order to reduce the amount of NOx (nitrogen 
oxides) in the exhaust-gas, an exhaust-gas 
recirculation (hereafter referred to as EGR) device has 
been used. The EGR device recirculates exhaust-gas to an 
air-intake passage via a recirculation passage 
(hereafter referred to as an EGR passage) usually 
provided between an exhaust manifold and an intake 
manifold. In such an EGR device, an EGR control valve 
is usually provided within the EGR passage. This EGR 
control valve controls the amount of exhaust-gas 
supplied to the air-intake passage. In a large vehicle, such as a truck, a bus, and 
such like, an exhaust-gas brake device is used as an 
assisting brake system. The exhaust-gas brake device 
has a cutoff valve disposed midway in the exhaust-gas 
passage. When the cutoff valve is closed, the exhaust-gas 
passage is blocked, thereby increasing the 
backpressure. The increased backpressure creates a 
braking action at the engine of the vehicle by means of 
increased pumping resistance. When a conventional 
exhaust-gas brake is operated, and if the backpressure 
increases above a certain pressure, the exhaust valves  
 
of the engine are forcibly pushed open by means of the 
backpressure during the intake cycle. As a result, the 
opening of the exhaust valves allows exhaust-gas to 
escape from the exaust passage, thereby preventing the 
backpressure exceeding the predetermined value. In an internal combustion engine equipped with 
an exhaust-gas brake and an EGR device for controlling 
exhaust emissions of NOx, the increase in backpressure 
due to the operation of the exhaust-gas brake causes 
the EGR control valve to be forcibly pushed open. If the 
EGR control valve is forcibly opened, it allows 
exhaust-gas to escape via the EGR passage, resulting in 
a drop in backpressure and leading to the problem of a 
reduction in the exhaust-gas braking action. To solve this problem, an EGR device which 
increases the opening force on the EGR control valve 
when the exhaust-gas brake is operated, is proposed in 
the Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 
63-79463. In this EGR device, the stem of the EGR 
control
