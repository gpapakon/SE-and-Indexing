<ABSTRACT>
Hard foams containing urethane groups and mainly isocyanurate groups are produced by reacting (1) polyisocyanates with (2) compounds having at least two hydrogen atoms reactive with isocyanates and a molecular weight from 400 to 10,000 in the presence of (3) organic foaming agents and (4) flameproofing agents, as well as (5) compounds with at least two hydrogen atoms reactive with isocyanates and a molecular weight from 32 to 399 as cross-linking agents, possibly in the presence of (6) other foaming agents and additives and adjuvants known per se. A component (2) having branched chains is associated to the flameproofing agent (4) and to the cross-linking agent (5) in a formulation in which the amount of component (2) is comprised between 30 and 90 parts by weight; the amount of component (4) is comprised between 10 and 60 parts by weight; the amount of component (5) is comprised between 10 and 20 parts by weight, the parts by weight of all these components adding up to 100. The reaction is carried out in a number range from 200 to 600.
