<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for watering
plants and more especially to apparatus for watering
plants, seedlings and seeds (all referred to hereinafter
simply as"plants") bedded into a growing medium contained
within a plastics enclosure such as a grow bag.Apparatus for watering hydroponic aggregate contained
in a garden box is known from US-PS-4085546. This
apparatus comprises a water holding reservoir connected
through a down-pipe to a housing positioned within the
aggregate and connected to an orificed pipe through which
water passes to the aggregate so as to reach a certain liquid level
within the box.Grow bags in themselves are well known and generally
are accepted as a useful way of growing flowers and
produce such as tomatoes in a variety of locations
including greenhouses, patios, sun rooms and balconies.Such a grow bag is disclosed in EP-A-0084938.
Grow bags essentially comprise a formulated growing medium
sealed within a plastics bag and provide a complete
environment in which flowers and crops can be 
grown.Conveniently, grow bags are marked with lines to
indicate to the user where incisions should be made in the
plastics covering for the planting of individual seeds or
seedlings. Such incisions are normally small in
comparison with the overall size of the grow bag to
minimise inter alia the effect of evaporation.Relatively
small incisions mean that only a small amount of the
growing medium is subjected to the effects of sun and
wind. This need to minimise the amount of growing medium
exposed to the elements has hitherto required that
watering of the grow bag contents is effected through the
incisions made to receive plants. Watering through these
relatively small incisions to an adequate extent to feed
all plants bedded in the growing medium is difficult to
achieve and almost impossible to check. The alternative
is to remove the uppermost side of the plastics covering.
Whilst this assists the watering process, it also
maximises the effects of evaporation and loss of growing
medium. In both cases, the gardener runs the risk of
wetting a plants leaves thereby causing plant burn. A
further problem associated with grow bags is caused by the
fact that they generally have high contents of peat and
fibrous material which are both light and easily disturbed
by water. If placed in direct sunlight any water added to
the growing medium will rapidly evaporate. Once dried,
the peat and fibrous material will not accept fresh water
readily, choosing instead to float on water added to the
bag
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Watering apparatus for use in combination with a growing
medium contained within a plastics bag (hereinafter

referred to as a "grow bag"), the apparatus comprising
an elongate hollow member (4) formed with

a series of apertures (5) along its length suitable to be inserted
into one end or side of a grow bag (7) and movable to a

position in which it lies on the surface of growing medium
present in the grow bag, and a reservoir (1) connected to

supply water to the hollow member (4), the spacings between
and/or dimensions of the apertures (5) being selected such

that water from a full reservoir (1) flows to and through
each aperture (5) of the hollow member (4).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the elongate
hollow member comprises a pipe (4) which extends outwardly

from one side of the reservoir (1) and communicates
therewith through an aperture (3) positioned towards the

base of the reservoir.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein the pipe (4)
is separable from the reservoir (1).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 wherein the pipe (4)
is formed integrally with the reservoir (1). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 4
wherein the end of the pipe (4) remote from the

reservoir (1) is closed by a smoothly contoured cap or plug
(6).
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 4
wherein the end of the pipe (4) remote from the reservoir

(1) is deformed to define a smoothly contoured profile.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims wherein the individual apertures (5) of the series

are spaced apart by distances which vary in relation to the
distance of a neighbouring pair of apertures (5) from the

reservoir (1).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 wherein the sizes of
individual apertures (5) vary, the aperture closest to the

reservoir (1) being of smaller area than that of the
aperture furthest from the reservoir (1).
