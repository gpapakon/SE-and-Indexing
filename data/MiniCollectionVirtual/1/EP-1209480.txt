<ABSTRACT>
For the purpose of reducing second-order static magnetic field components in
an MRI apparatus, a first circular loop coil (C1) and a second circular loop coil

(C2) are disposed at positions spaced in a static magnetic field (B0) direction
to be symmetrical with respect to a center (Z0) of an imaging region of an MRI

apparatus (100). Similarly, a third circular loop coil (C3) and a fourth circular
loop coil (C4) are disposed. A first corrective magnetic field (bz1) and a

second corrective magnetic field (bz2) are generated in the same direction by
the first and second circular loop coils (C1) and (C2), and a third corrective

magnetic field (bz3) and a fourth corrective magnetic field (bz4) are generated
in the same direction and opposite to the first corrective magnetic field (bz1)

by the third and fourth circular loop coils (C3) and (C4). The second-order
components of the static magnetic field (B0) are corrected by the corrective

magnetic fields (bz1 ― bz4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a second-order static magnetic field correcting method and an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) apparatus, and more particularly to a second-order static magnetic field correcting method for correcting second-order static magnetic field components to improve homogeneity in an MRI apparatus and an MRI apparatus that can implement the method.The static magnetic field of an MRI apparatus should be homogeneous. Homogeneity of the static magnetic field is achieved by mechanical shimming or by adding small pieces of magnet, iron or the like.A metal mass (e.g., an automobile) moving near the MRI apparatus or an environment change (e.g., a change in temperature) varies the static magnetic field, and second-order static magnetic field components are generated.Pulse sequences that observe gradient echoes, such as one according to GRASS (gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state) or SPGR (spoiled GRASS), are very sensitive to the static magnetic field components, and the generation of the second-order static magnetic field components leads to degradation of image quality.Known MRI methods and apparatus are disclosed, for example, in US 4,768,009 which discloses a static magnetic field correcting method according to the preamble of claim 1 and an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 2. US 5,485,088, GB 1,135,332, US 4,284,950, US 4,812,765 and by Ntoutoume TA, et al, J. Phys. E., Vol. 22, No. 8, pages 557 to 560 (1989).It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a second-order static magnetic field correcting method for correcting second-order static magnetic field components to improve homogeneity and an MRI apparatus that can implement the method.In a first aspect, the present invention provides a second-order static magnetic field correcting method as defined in claim 1.Still a further aspect of the present invention provides an MRI apparatus as defined in claim 2.In this specification, by a "second order" is meant a quadric function of a position in a static magnetic field direction. By a "zeroth order" is meant independence of the position in the static magnetic field direction. Furthermore, by a "first order" is meant a linear function of the static magnetic field direction.In the second-order static magnetic field correcting method of the first aspect, since the direction of the first and second corrective magnetic fields generated by the first and second circular loop coils is opposite to the direction of the third and fourth corrective
