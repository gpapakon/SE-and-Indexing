<ABSTRACT>
A hologram structure for use in a holographic center high 
mounted stoplight system for a vehicle is disclosed. The hologram 

structure includes first (31) and second hologram layers 
laminarly secured to each other, each having a plurality of 

bright hologram cells and dim hologram cells formed therein, 
and each hologram cell (C
i,j
) being configured to diffract light 
into a predetermined solid angular region. The bright hologram 

cells and the dim hologram cells of each hologram are arranged 
in a pattern to produce a recognizable pattern of bright and 

dim areas (Fig. 3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The disclosed invention is directed generally to 
holograms for center high mounted stoplights for vehicles, 
and more particularly to a hologram that efficiently meets 
the required brightness and angular coverage and to an 
exposure technique for recording such hologram. Present US federal regulations require center high 
mounted stoplights (CHMSLs) in addition to the standard 
stoplights mounted in the rear portion of an automobile. 
The high mounted stoplights are intended to maximize the 
visibility of the automobile braking indicators to drivers 
following the braking vehicle, and are commonly mounted on 
the rear window of an automobile. High mounted stoplights have commonly been implemented 
as a standard lenticular lens, a red filter, an illuminating 
incandescent bulb, and a reflector enclosed in a 
housing that is typically secured adjacent the top or 
bottom of an automobile rear window. However, the bulky 
housing partially obscures the rearward vision of the 
driver, and moreover imposes limitations on the design of 
the automobile. Center high mounted stoplights have been also integrated 
into automobile body parts such as rear decks, 
spoilers, roofs, which to some degree substantially reduce 
or remove the rearward vision problem. However, such  
 
stoplights are complex and may impose limitations on the 
design of the automobile. Holographic center high mounted stoplights have also 
been developed in order to efficiently meet the stoplight 
regulations. A consideration with the use of holograms for 
holographic center high mounted stoplights is the desire to 
achieve an output having a lenticulated appearance that is 
similar to that provided by conventional stoplights. Another consideration with the use of holograms for 
holographic center high mounted stoplights is the complexity 
in meeting governmental luminous intensity and angular 
coverage requirements while utilizing a reconstruction 
light source of minimum power. The luminous intensity and 
angular coverage requirements generally include a quantitative 
aspect that defines luminous intensity over a defined 
central angular region, and a qualitative aspect that 
requires visibility over a horizontal angular region that 
is greater than the horizontal component of the defined 
central angular region. Essentially, the regulations 
require a brighter region generally in the center of the 
entire angular field of coverage. It would therefore be an advantage to provide a 
holographic center high mounted stoplight that provides an
