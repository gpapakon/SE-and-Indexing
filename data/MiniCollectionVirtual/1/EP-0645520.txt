<ABSTRACT>
A method of measuring the velocities of water 
volumes flowing co-directionally in separate conduits 

(14, 18) nested such as in injection or production 
well-bores allows an oxygen activation measurement of 

the velocity of the water flow in the tubing-casing 
annulus (20) in the presence of water flowing in the 

tubing string in the same direction. The method 
provides continuous logging at variable or constant 

cable velocities or stationary logging. Based on the 
method of velocity gauging, the method isolates the 

signal from the annular flow and can produce a 
continuous log of linear and volumetric annular flow 

rates with depth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with measuring the
relative and absolute velocity of liquids, specifically
of water or fluids mixed with water, as applied to
oil-field operations.Depleted oil production zones may be rejuvenated
by water flooding. In this process the casing opposite
the formation under consideration is plugged off by
packers above and below the production zone. Water
injection tubing, nested within the casing of an
injection well, allows injection water to flow down the
tubing to the desired injection zone, exit the tubing
through specialized hardware, and flow in the annulus
between the tubing and the casing. From this annulus
the water enters the formation through perforations in
the casing, pushing the oil in the formation ahead of
the water-flood front. For good and sufficient reasons
it is very important to the operator to monitor the
velocity of the water flow in the tubing-casing
annulus, and therefore the volumetric flow into a
particular zone of the formation, throughout the
vertical profile of the well.Various methods are known for measuring the
water-flow velocity through a single conduit such as
the injection tubing itself. For example, the water
flow velocity within the injection tubing can be
measured by placing a spinner-type flowmeter inside the
tubing. However, that method can not, of course, be
used to measure the flow velocity in the annulus
between the tubing and the casing which is inaccessible
to a mechanical flowmeter.Methods of measurement, which do not rely upon
direct access to the flow stream in the tubing-casing
annulus, have been described to measure the velocity of
water flowing in the annulus. A radioactive tracer,
for example, could be mixed with the injected fluid to 
monitor the progress of the fluid with detectors
sensitive to radioactive decay. That method is
unattractive, first because of the need for handling
radioactive substances and, second, because the results
are highly qualitative.Another method, referred to as oxygen activation,
may be used to measure the velocity of water flow
inaccessible to direct measurement. This method
consists of continuously irradiating the oxygen nuclei
of the flowing water with high-energy neutrons to
generate therefrom the unstable isotope N16 which has a
half life of 7.13 seconds. As the isotope decays,
gamma rays are emitted which are counted by two
radiation detectors downstream of the source that are
spaced a distance, s, apart. The time behaviour of the
recorded count rates as seen at the two detectors
follow the
