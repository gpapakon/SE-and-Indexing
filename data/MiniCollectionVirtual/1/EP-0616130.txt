<ABSTRACT>
It is proposed, on a gear pump rotor with sliding bearing lubricated by the working fluid, to adjust the sliding bearing lubricating groove (7) in dependence on the pump operation by azimuthal rotation of a bearing bush (5) in which the groove (7) is made and thus to optimise the shaft bearing arrangement in dependence on operation.

A method for an operation-dependent optimization 
of the mounting of a gear pump rotor slide bearing lubricated 

by the conveyed product and having a lubricating groove, 
characterised in that the position of the lubricating groove 

is adjusted by pivoting around the slide bearing axis (A). 
The method according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the bearing temperature (ϑ
L
) is detected as a 
measured controlled variable and is compared to a set value 

(W), and depending on the comparison result (Δ), the pivoting 
position (α) of the lubricating groove (7) is adjusted as a 

regulation. 
The method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the pivoting position (α) of the 

lubricating groove (7) is adjusted depending on the pump 
speed (n) and/or the pressure difference (Δp) between gear 

pump inlet and outlet, and preferably in that when the 
bearing temperature is controlled reference variable (W) is 

adjusted depending on the speed (n) and/or said pressure 
difference (Δp). 
The method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that for at least two rotor bearings the 

respective pivoting positions of the lubricating grooves of 
said bearings are adjusted or controlled independantly. 
A gear pump with at least one gear rotor mounted 
at least on one side in product lubricated slide bearings and 

with at least one lubricating groove (7) provided generally 
axially on the inner bores of the slide bearings, 

characterised in that a bearing bush (5) which is rotatable 
around the bearing axis (A) and which comprises the groove 

(7) on its inner bore is provided and is operatively 
connected to a control member (9, 17) which can be actuated 

from the outside for the pivoting position of the bearing 
bush (5). 
The gear pump according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the control member (17) is a control 

element in a regulator circuit in which the bearing 
temperature preferably acts on the control member (17) as a  

 
measured controlled variable (X) through a set/actual value 

comparison unit (13). 
The gear pump according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that a speed sensor for the pump speed 

and/or a pressure sensor for the differential pressure 
between the pump inlet and outlet are provided and at least 

one of the pressure sensor output signals acts on the control 
member (17). 
The gear pump according to one of claims 5 to 7, 
comprising two of the rotor shaft bearings mounted in product 

lubricated slide bearings, whereby the respective pivoting 
positions of the lubricating grooves of both bearings are 

adjustable or controlled independantly.
