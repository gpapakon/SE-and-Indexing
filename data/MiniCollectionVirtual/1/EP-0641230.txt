<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical nerve and muscle stimulation
and particularly although not exclusively to electro-medical treatment for
urinary and faecal incontinence, primarily in women but equally adaptable for
men. In particular the invention concerns an apparatus for application of
electrical stimulation to patients suffering from incontinence, said apparatus
having a generator for providing a series of electrical stimulation pulses.Conventional electro-stimulation treatments for urinary and faecal
incontinence require a patient to apply stimulation via an internal electrode in
electrical contact with the body. Treatment is applied for periods ranging
from 10 minutes to several hours each day.A conventional electro-stimulation system includes pulse generator
housed in a portable battery box, and an electrode pad for attachment to the
patient. Such systems are often used for the relief of chronic back pain or
induced muscle contraction. These systems fall under the general
classification of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation systems (TENS).The above mentioned electro-stimulation systems conventionally use a
drive signal to the electrode which is characterised by a sine wave, square
wave, or spike impulse geometry, and is either monophasic, capacitively
coupled monophasic, biphasic or asymmetric. Differing therapeutic effects
are achieved using different drive signal types. Conventionally such
stimulation systems allow for a variation of drive signal pulse width or
frequency by the patient. However each such known portable stimulation 
system has electronics which are dedicated for providing a specific
predetermined drive signal having a geometry and other characteristics
matched to the intended therapeutic effect. Adjustment of the control signal
is conventionally provided by electronic push switches and or rotational
control knobs. Such switches and knobs can often be tampered with by the
patient, and it is thus difficult for a medical practitioner prescribing electro-stimulation
treatment to control the treatment when the patient is away from
a clinic.Other known electro-stimulators include microprocessor based units,
but these have a problem that conventionally, specialised pre-programming
equipment needs to be used at the clinic to set the signal parameters. Such
equipment is expensive and often difficult to use.Specific embodiments of the present invention aim to provide electro-stimulation
apparatus which can be adjusted and preset by a medical
practitioner, medical

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for application of electrical stimulation to
patients suffering from incontinence, said apparatus

having a generator (1) for providing a series of
electrical stimulation pulses, characterized by a

perineal surface electrode (205) comprising a sheet
electrode having an hour glass shape and responsive to

said series of electrical stimulation pulses for
positioning over a perineal portion of a patient to

stimulate dorsal and perineal branches of the patient's
pudendal nerve and a sacral surface (200) sheet

electrode having a shape of a generally truncated
triangle and responsive to said series of electrical

stimulation pulses for stimulating nerves in the sacral
region.
The apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that the sacral surface sheet electrode (200) includes

an apex plateau region with a dipped portion thereon
for facilitating finger placement of the sacral surface

electrode over the sacral region.
The apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that an indifferent electrode is provided for balancing

pulse geometry over a patient's sacral plexus, the
indifferent electrode being of arbitrary shape and

size.
The apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that the generator (1) provides a pulse train of

bi-phasic pulses, with a modulated envelope having a
duration in the range of 100 to 1,000 microseconds, and

N pulses per envelope, N being between 1 and 1,000. 
The apparatus according to claim 4, characterized in
that the modulated envelope has a sequential, random or

fixed frequency of between 0.1 and 100 Hz.
The apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in
that the pulses in each envelope corresponds to a

frequency between 500 and 5,000 Hz.
