<ABSTRACT>
A micro-tip electron source prodn. process involves: (a) producing a structure comprising an insulating substrate (10) bearing one or more cathode conductors (12) covered with an insulating layer (14) and then a conductive grid layer (16), holes (18) being formed through these layers (14,16) to each cathode conductor (12); and (b) forming a micro-tip of electron-emissive metal on the cathode conductor (12) in each hole (18), and an insulating protective layer (50) on the grid layer (16), depositing (pref. electrolytically) electron-emissive metal to overfill the holes, removing the protective layer and electrolytically etching the metal deposit (60) to form the micro-tips.

Process for the production of a microtip electron source, in which:

a structure (49) is produced which comprises an electrically insulating
substrate (10), at least one cathode conductor (12) on said substrate,

an electrically insulating layer (14) covering each cathode conductor,
an electrically conductive gate layer (16) covering said electrically

insulating layer, holes (18, 19) being formed through said gate layer and
the electrically insulating layer, at each cathode conductor and
in each hole is formed a microtip (62), which is made from an electron
emitting metallic material and which rests on the cathode conductor

corresponding to said hole,
said process being characterized in that the formation of the microtips
involves the following stages:
an electrically insulating protective layer (50) is formed on the gate
layer (16),
a chemical deposit of the electron emitting metallic material is formed
at the bottom of the holes until said metallic material overflows the

holes,
the protective layer (50) is eliminated and
electrolytic etching takes place of the deposited metallic material, so
as to obtain the microtips (62) from said metallic material.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the chemical
deposit of the electron emitting metallic material is an electrolytic

deposit.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the gate layer
(16) is used as the cathode for the electrolytic etching of the metallic 

material.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the protective layer (50) is formed by depositing, under grazing

incidence, a layer of electrically insulating material on the gate layer
(16).
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the protective layer is formed by anodic oxidation of the gate layer

(16).
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the gate layer (16) is made from a material chosen from within the

group including niobium, tantalum and aluminium.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the metallic material is chosen from within the group including iron,

nickel, chromium, Fe-Ni, gold, silver and copper.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the protective layer (50) is eliminated by chemical etching.
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the protect
ive layer (50) is eliminated by reactive ionic etching.
