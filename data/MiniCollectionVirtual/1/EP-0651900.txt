<ABSTRACT>
A multi-mode route guidance system and a corresponding method for same include a device to determine a present position, and an input device (111) for inputting a destination position. A map database (115) provides memory capable of storing a first type of record (225) that has topology and connectivity information (227), and a second type of record (217) that has topology, connectivity, and traffic flow restriction information (227, 229). A route guidance device (101) retrieves selected records (217, 219, 221, 223, 225) from the map database (115), determined by the specified destination position and the present position of a traveler. The route guidance device (101) uses a selected record of the first type (225) to provide ground track guidance cues (601) to the traveler, and a selected record of the second type (217) to provide maneuver instruction guidance cues (501) to the traveler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to the field of navigation
and more particularly to systems for providing route guidance to a
traveler based on a map reference.Typical navigation systems can be essentially categorized into at
least two distinct types, dot-on-the-map and route guidance. The
dot-on-the-map type navigation systems are based on topology
map databases. These topology map databases are relatively
commonplace and many navigation systems have been designed
to use this type of map database to guide a traveler between an
origin and a destination position. Topology map databases
typically are limited to providing elementary topological
information. In those map databases used in vehicular navigation
systems this may include road segment identification, road
segment end points and road segment predecessors and successors.
Because these map databases have no traffic flow restriction
information, such as one way streets, dead end streets, speed
limits, maximum vehicle weight, and maximum vehicle height,
to name a few, they are limited in usefulness. This is because if
the system is asked to plan and guide the traveler along a route it
may plan impossible, or certainly inconvenient, routes for the
traveler to follow. Typically, dot-on-the-map systems display an
electronic map and a symbol, typically a dot, corresponding to the
traveler's present position. The traveler will traverse a route with
no advice from the system other than a pointer in the line of sight
direction of a selected destination position. Route guidance systems, on the other hand, generate a route
plan between a present position and a selected destination position
and then guide the traveler in real time via a series of visual
and/or aural guidance instructions.Both the dot-on-the-map and route guidance systems rely on
the availability of maps, typically in the form of digital map
databases. Most of the United States, Europe, and Japan are already
covered by topology map databases containing road network
topology and connectivity information. These topology map
databases are adequate for dot-on-the-map type navigation
systems.In contrast, route guidance systems require traffic flow
restriction information in addition to the road network topology
information provided in the topology databases. The map
databases required for this enhanced function are typically known
as route guidance maps. In addition to the conventional
topological information discussed above they will include various
traffic flow restriction information, also

end node for planner position to the destination position of the traveler if

the selected records allow for connecting a path, having traffic flow
restriction attributes, between the provided present position and the

destination position of the traveler, said route guidance means equates an
end node for planner position to an intermediate position nearest to the

destination position of the traveler if the set of records retrieved do not
allow for connecting a path, having traffic flow restriction attributes,

between the provided present position and the destination position of the
traveler and allow for connecting a path, having traffic flow restriction 

attributes, between the provided present position of the traveler and the
intermediate position, wherein, if said end node for planner position can be equated, said route guidance means connects a

planned route between the provided present position of the traveler to the
end node for planner position using the road segments extracted from the

selected records, and said route guidance means generates a
