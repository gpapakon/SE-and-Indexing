<ABSTRACT>
Successive frames of data (10) are processed to 
provide a plurality of data streams (27, 29) 

containing the data in different orders. In an 
illustrated embodiment, two different data streams 

(27, 29) are output for incoming frames of video 
data. Pixels are grouped from an incoming current 

video frame to provide successive pairs thereof for 
storage in a first memory bank (16) at a first clock 

rate  . Stored pixel pairs are read from a 
second memory bank (18) containing a previous video 

frame at a second clock rate 2  while the pairs 
of pixels from the current video frame are being 

stored in the first memory bank (16) at rate  .
 

This provides two pairs of pixels from the previous 
video frame for each one pair of pixels stored from 

a current video frame. The pixel pairs from the 
previous video frame output from the second memory 

bank are combined into two data streams, each 
providing the pixels in a different order. The 

memory banks are alternated (14, 20) to process 
successive frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
communication of digital data and more particularly
to the processing of successive frames of digital
information to provide a plurality of different data
streams from each frame. The invention is
particularly applicable to the communication of
digital video signals, in which a plurality of
different scanning formats are needed for different
processing functions.Television signals are conventionally
transmitted in analog form according to various
standards adopted by particular countries. For
example, the United States has adopted the standards
of the National Television System Committee
("NTSC"). Most European countries have adopted
either PAL (Phase Alternating Line) or SECAM
(Sequential Color And Memory) standards.Digital transmission of television signals can
deliver video and audio services of much higher
quality than analog techniques. Digital
transmission schemes are particularly advantageous
for signals that are broadcast by satellite to cable
television affiliates and/or directly to home
satellite television receivers. It is expected that
digital television transmitter and receiver systems 
will replace existing analog systems just as digital
compact discs have largely replaced analog
phonograph records in the audio industry.A substantial amount of digital data must be
transmitted in any digital television system. This
is particularly true where high definition
television ("HDTV") is provided. In a digital
television system, a subscriber receives the digital
data stream via a receiver/descrambler that provides
video, audio, and data to the subscriber. In order
to most efficiently use the available radio
frequency spectrum, it is advantageous to compress
the digital television signals to minimize the
amount of data that must be transmitted.The video portion of a television signal
comprises a sequence of video "frames" that together
provide a moving picture. In digital television
systems, each line of a video frame is defined by a
sequence of digital data referred to as "pixels." A
large amount of data is required to define each
video frame of a television signal. For example,
7.4 megabits of data is required to provide one
video frame at NTSC resolution. This assumes a 640
pixel by 480 line display is used with 8 bits of
intensity value for each of the primary colors red,
green and blue. High definition television requires
substantially more data to provide each video frame.
In order to manage this amount of data, particularly
for HDTV applications, the data
