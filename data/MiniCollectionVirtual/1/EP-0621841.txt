<ABSTRACT>
A fluid transfer system comprising a fluid conducting flexible pipe (4) having a first (9) and a second connector end, which pipe during use extends over an area of water, preferably totally or partially submerged in the water, between a first (8) and a second (7) hook-up point and, when not in use, is stored (5) near the first hook-up point (8), a ramp (11) curved downward in the vertical plane for supporting the flexible pipe (4) during the transfer thereof from storage position to position for use, and vice versa, and a means (13) for feeding out/hauling in the flexible pipe (4) via said curved ramp (11), the lower end of which is situated at a distance from the adjacent first hook-up point (8). The ramp (11) is movably mounted (12) for movement from a position for feeding out/hauling in the pipe to a position closer and so oriented relative to the adjacent connection point (8) that said first connector end (9) may be brought into at least approximately aligned coupling position vis-à-vis the adjacent first hook-up point (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fluid transfer system comprising a 
fluid conducting flexible pipe having a first and second 
connector end, which pipe during use extends over an area of 
water, preferably totally or partially submerged in the 
water, between a first and second hook-up point and, when not 
in use, is stored near the first hook-up point, a ramp curved 
downward in the vertical plane for supporting the flexible 
pipe during the transfer thereof from storage position to 
position for use, and vice versa, and a means, e.g., a 
lifting cable, for feeding out/hauling in the flexible pipe 
via said curved ramp, the lower detached end of which is 
situated at a distance from the adjacent first hook-up 
point. The invention was developed primarily in connection with the 
need for a fluid transfer system between a maritime floating 
oil storage facility, for example a large barge with oil 
storing capacity, and a so-called shuttle tanker. The oil 
tank barge is anchored or dynamically positioned at the oil 
production field and serves as an intermediate storage means 
for the oil produced. From this barge the oil is loaded 
over into tankers, which on arrival at the field are 
connected to the barge by suitable mooring means, whereafter 
a fluid conducting pipe connection is established between the 
barge and tanker. The fluid conducting pipe connection is 
formed by a fluid conducting pipe which, when not in use, is 
stored on the barge. When this flexible fluid conducting 
pipe is to be utilized for fluid transfer between the barge 
and tanker, the flexible pipe from the barge is fed down into 
the water via a ramp curved downward in the vertical plane, 
which supports the flexible pipe in the initial phase of 
connection. As soon as a sufficient length of the flexible 
pipe has been fed out and is suspended down in the water from  
 
the barge, the other end of the pipe is hauled on board the 
tanker and there is hooked up to a manifold, or the like. 
The flexible pipe end at the barge is also connected to a 
suitable hook-up point on the barge, whereafter the fluid 
transfer may begin. During the fluid transfer the flexible 
pipe is suspended between the barge and the tanker, more or 
less submerged in water, or if desired is freely suspended 
above the water surface. After fluid transfer is completed, the flexible pipe is 
disconnected on the tanker side and dropped down into the 
water, whereafter it is disconnected on the barge side and 
then hauled in via the aforementioned curved ramp, to be

<CLAIMS>
A fluid transfer system comprising a fluid conducting 
flexible pipe (4) having a first (9) and a second connector 

end, which pipe during use extends over an area of water, 
preferably totally or partially submerged in the water, 

between a first (8) and a second (7) hook-up point and, when 
not in use, is stored (5) near the first hook-up point (8), a 

ramp (11) curved downward in the vertical plane for supporting 
the flexible pipe (4) during the transfer thereof from 

storage position to position for use, and vice versa, and a 
means (13), e.g., a lifting cable for feeding out/hauling in 

the flexible pipe (4) via said curved ramp (11), the lower 
end of which is situated at a distance from the adjacent 

first hook-up point,
characterized in
 that the ramp (11) is 
movably mounted (12) for movement from a position for 

feeding out/hauling in the pipe to a position closer and so 
oriented relative to the adjacent hook-up point (8) that 

said first connector end (9) can be brought into at least 
approximately aligned coupling position vis á vis the 

adjacent first hook-up point (8). 
A fluid transfer system according to claim 1,
characterized in
 that the ramp (11) is 
pivotably mounted in the vertical plane. 
A fluid transfer system according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in
 that the ramp (11) is 
pivotably mounted with a parallelogram joint mechanism (12). 
A fluid transfer system according to one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized in
 that on the free  
 

end of the ramp is provided a steering device (14) for 
maneuvering the flexible pipe (4) and the pipe end (9) such 

that, when the pipe is fed out, it is controllably moved 
inward until the lifting cable (13), or the like, comes into 

contact with the ramp's support surface (15), or it is 
steered in onto the ramp when being hauled in.
