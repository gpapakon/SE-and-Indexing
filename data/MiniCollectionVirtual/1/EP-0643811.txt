<DESCRIPTION>
It is the universal aim of valve designers to
improve operating performance, reduce size relative to
flow capacity, and to lower production costs.In the past, valve bodies have been formed by
extensive machining of solid material and more recently
valve bodies have been die cast from metal or injection
molded from plastic materials. Die casting has distinct
advantages over machined valve bodies because of free
holes and extra shaping which can be obtained. Even more
sophisticated valve body configurations are possible
through plastic molding.However, die cast and molded valve bodies, as
currently designed and produced, generally require
substantial machining, port thread inserts, retaining
caps, gaskets, and assembly screws. To form internal
channels that intersect, expensive drilling and plugging
operations are necessary. Further, grooves and large
internal galleries are not normally formed in the molding
process, because core pin removal would be impossible.
Therefore, extra parts are required to form galleries and
grooves which consume space and add to the overall cost
of the valve.Many valves include push-in fittings, in which
the flow tubes can be inserted and removed from the valve
body without the use of a tool. The normal push-in
fitting consists of a threaded body, a collet to attach
the body to the tube and an O-ring seal. The body of the
fitting represents the major share of the cost and size
of the fitting.Exhaust silencing is also used with many
pneumatic valves and this is accomplished by turning
conically shaped sintered metal elements into the valve
exhaust port. In most situations the valve silencing
element is required to be installed by the valve user,
which adds to the overall cost of the valve. US-A-3092141 which forms a basis for the preamble of claim 1 discloses a valve with plural body
sections which mate with one another.The invention is directed to an improved valve
construction in which the body of the valve is formed in
two or more layers of sections which are joined at
interfaces that lie in planes parallel to the direction of
operation of the operating components of the valve.According to the present invention, there is provided
a valve construction comprising a body including a
plurality of body sections each having an inner surface,
said inner surfaces being disposed in contiguous relation
along an interface, each inner surface having a plurality
of channel portions each mating with complementary channel
portions in the surface of the body section to form fluid
channels,

<CLAIMS>
A valve construction comprising a body (1) including
a plurality of body sections (2a,2b) each having an inner

surface (3), said inner surfaces being disposed in
contiguous relation along an interface, each inner surface

having a plurality of channel portions each mating with
complementary channel portions in the surface of the body

section to form fluid channels, and means for introducing
an operating fluid in said channels, characterised by:

   said channels forming a main fluid channel
(4,6,8,11,12,14) and a pilot channel (15,17), valve means

(30,42) mounted for movement in said main channel (8) for
controlling the flow of fluid through said main channel,

and pressure responsive pilot means (39,53) communicating
with said pilot channel (15,17) and operably connected to

said valve means (30,42) and responsive to a predetermined
pressure of said fluid in said pilot channel (15,17) for

moving said valve means in said main fluid channel to
thereby control the flow of fluid in said main channel.
The valve construction of claim 1, wherein said
pressure responsive pilot means (39,53) comprises a

diaphragm exposed to said pilot channel (15,17) and
connected to said valve means (39,53).
The valve construction of claim 1, and including
second valve means (60) disposed in said pilot channel

(15,17) to control the flow of fluid therein, said second
valve means being operable through external stimuli (56) to

control the flow of fluid in said pilot channel.
The valve construction of claim 1, wherein the valve
means (30) includes a valve element (31) mounted to move in

a direction parallel to the plane of said interface. 
The valve construction of claim 4, and including a
valve seat (33,34) mounted in mating channel portions of

each body section, said movable valve element (31) disposed
to engage said seat.
The valve construction of claim 1, wherein each inner
surface (3) has a plurality of port sections each mating

with a complementing port section in the inner surface of
the other body section to form ports (4,7,10,14) that

establishes communication between said channels and the
exterior of said valve body.
The valve construction of claim 6, wherein a first of
said ports comprises an inlet (4) for the introduction of

fluid to said body, a second of said ports comprises an
outlet (7), and a third of said ports comprises an exhaust

port (10).
The valve construction of claim 7, and including
silencing means (72) disposed within said body and

extending across said exhaust port (10).
The valve construction of claim 8, wherein each
surface (3) is provided with a groove section adjacent said

exhaust port to mate with and complement a groove section
in the other surface to form a groove (71), said silencing

means (72) being disposed within said groove.
The valve construction of claim 9, wherein said
silencing means (72) is composed of sintered material.
The valve construction of claim 6, and including a
connector (20) disposed in at least one of said ports

(4,7,14), said connector (20) comprising a flexible
cylindrical section (22) disposed in said port and an

enlarged inner section (23), said body having an internal
abutment (28) bordering said port, the enlarged inner 

section (23) of said connector (20) engaged with said
abutment (28) to prevent axial displacement of said

connector from said port, and a plurality of surface
deviations (25) disposed on the inner surface of said

cylindrical section (20) and disposed to engage a tube (26)
inserted within said port.
The valve construction of claim 11, wherein the
surface deviations (25) are barbs.
The valve construction of claim 1, wherein at least
one of the channels (8) is non-circular in cross section

and has a long dimension and a short dimension, said long
dimension being disposed normal to the plane of said

interface.
The valve construction of claim 3, wherein said second
valve means (60) is a solenoid valve.
