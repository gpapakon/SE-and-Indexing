<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of US 5,317,627,
filed March 16, 1992 which is a continuation of US 5,113,430
filed on October 1st, 1990, allowed January 28, 1992.The present invention relates generally to the field of
telecommunications, and more specifically, to the field of
automated peripheral systems providing telecommunication
services.The field of telecommunication services is very large. One area
of telecommunication services assists calling parties in transferring
information from the calling parties to destination
parties, thus assisting parties in "giving" information. This
first area of telecommunication services includes, without 
limitation, such services as voice mail, voice messaging, operator-assisted
call-bridging, registration/reservation services,
and catalog ordering services.A second area of telecommunication services assists callers
in retrieving information from remote sources, thus assisting
parties in "receiving" information. This second area of telecommunication
services includes, without limitation, such services
as directory assistance, news services, stock market services,
and credit validation services.In the past, automated telecommunication systems have typically
offered only one, or a selected few, of the above-mentioned
services.From the WO 92/06548 of the same applicant as the present
invention an apparatus and method for providing enhanced wide
area audio-response services is known that includes a central
controller connected through a public network to a plurality of
audio peripherals which are distributed over a wide area to
receive and originate telephone calls to receive, store and
forward audio signals, the central controller providing error
notification services to operator personnel, providing utility
grade service to the audio-peripherals, and utilizing Dialed
Number Identification Service (DNIS) methods for identifying
various applications, such as voice messaging, audio text, and
remote information provider accessing. According to Art. 54 IV
EPC the WO 92/06548 is for the contracting countries AT, BE, CH,
DE, DK, ES, FR, GB, GR, IT, LU, NL and SE a document according
to Art. 54 III EPC.There is, therefore, a need in the industry for an automated
telecommunication system capable of providing a large
variety of services.The solution of this problem is given in the independent
claims.Briefly described, the present invention includes, in its
most preferred embodiment, a method and an apparatus for providing
customized, telecommunication services. The

Claims for the following Contracting States : AT, BE, CH, DE, DK, ES, FR, GB, GR, IT, LU, NL, SE
Method of providing customized telecommunication services
to callers calling from customer telephones (14, 15), said

method comprising the steps of:

configuring a public switched network (12) to direct calls
from customer telephones (14, 15) to input ports (50) on a

first node (30) of a telecommunication peripheral system
(10);
receiving at least a destination number or an equivalent
thereof through an inp
ut port (50) after a caller dials a
number on a first customer telephone (14, 15) assigned to

an origination number;
generating input port identification data identifying the
input port (50) receiving at least the destination number

or an equivalent thereof;
analyzing the input port identification data to select,
initiate and configure a customized telecommunication application

that bridges a call; and
bridging the call by the selected customized telecommunication
application (90) by bridging the input port (50) with

an output port (51).
The method according to claim 1, further including the step
of recording conversation over the bridged connection.
The method according to claim 1 or 2, further including the
step of configuring the public switched network (12) to

direct to a second node (30) of the telecommunication peripheral
system (10) calls originally directed to the first

node (30) upon unavailability of the first node (30).
A call bridging apparatus comprising:

a public switched network (12) configured to direct calls
from customer telephones (14, 15) to input ports (50) on a

first node (30) of a telecommunication peripheral system
(10) ; 
means for receiving (32) at least a destination number or
an equivalent thereof through an input port (50) after a

caller dials a number on a first customer telephone (14,
15) assigned to an origination number;
means for generating (32) input port identification data
identifying the input port (50) receiving at least the

destination number or an equivalent thereof;
means for analyzing (74) the input port identification data
to select, initiate and configure a customized telecommunication

application, wherein the selected customized telecommunication
application (90) is configured to bridge the

input port (50) with an output port (51).
The apparatus according to claim 4, further including means
for recording (82) conversation over the bridged connection.
The apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the public
switched network (12) is configured to direct to a second

node (30) of the telecommunication peripheral system (10)
