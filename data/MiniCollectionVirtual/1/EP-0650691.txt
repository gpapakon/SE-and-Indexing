<ABSTRACT>
A rotary cutting attachment for removing linoleum, tile, mastic, grout, 
adhesive and the like from floors. The cutting attachment includes a drive 

plate (18), and elastomeric ring (14), a cutter head (16), a block plate 
(18), six cutter blocks (22) and three cutter inserts (24) per cutter block. 

The elastomeric ring separates the drive plate from the cutter head and 
allows the attachment to adjust to the contour of the floor. The drive plate 

and the cutter head have sets of gears (34) which mesh to transfer rotation 
of the drive plate to the cutter head. In turn, an offset member of the cutter 

head mates with an offset bore of the block plate to transfer rotation of 
the cutter head to the block plate. The six cutter blocks are removably 

mounted to the block plate and three cutter inserts are removably mounted 
to each cutter block. Typically, three cutting attachments, each driven by 

a hydraulic motor, are utilized in concert to remove a floor covering. The 
three cutting attachments are arranged in a triangle such that the cutting 

path of one cutting attachment overlaps the cutting paths of the other two 
cutting attachment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus
for removing floor covering, and particularly, but not by way of
limitation, to an apparatus using a rotary cutting attachment for
removing linoleum, tile, grout, mastic, adhesive residue and the
like from floors.In removing floor coverings, the surface of the floor is
often uneven. In some cases, the base surface of concrete or the
like is not perfectly flat. In other situations, the base surface
may be substantially flat, but residue of floor covering makes the
upper surface irregular. Accordingly, the ability to adjust to the
contour of the surface is important in removing floor covering
efficiently.Some devices for removing floor covering utilize a
plurality of springs in order to adjust to the contour of the
surface. For example, U. S. Patent No. 4,614,380 discloses a
scraper assembly which has two springs disposed between each blade
holder and the scraper plate. As another example, U. S. Patent No.
4,614,380 describes a stripping machine which includes three
springs for each cutter pad of the machine.The multiplicity of springs and components used in these
devices may cause difficulties in operation and maintenance.
First, more components generally means greater complexity of the 
device and increased chance of component failure. Second, the
large number of springs and associated elements makes replacement
of worn or damaged springs too difficult and time-consuming.The present invention is a cutter attachment for removing
floor covering from a surface
as defined in the first part of claim 1 and known from US-A-4
614 380.
The cutter attachment includes a
drive plate, a head plate, an elastomeric ring, a block plate, six
cutter blocks and three cutter inserts mounted to each cutter
block. The elastomeric ring separates the drive plate and the head
plate and allows the cutter attachment to adjust to the contour of
the surface.The drive plate and the block plate may be removably
attached to the drive plate to rotate with the drive plate. The
cutter blocks, in turn, may be removably mounted to the block plate.Three cutter attachments are typically utilized together
to remove floor covering from a surface. A rotary motor may be
connected to each drive plate to rotate the cutter inserts against
the floor covering.A wheeled frame may be provided for propelling the cutter
attachments over the surface. The frame may be self-propelled or
hand-propelled.One object of the present invention is to provide an
apparatus which adjusts to the contour of a
