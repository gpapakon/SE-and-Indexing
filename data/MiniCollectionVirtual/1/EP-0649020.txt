<ABSTRACT>
A method of conducting assays for analytes, usually from 
biological samples, utilizing bioaffinity reagents linked 

to luminescent lanthanide chelates, which are synthesized 
so that the non-radiative quenching of the ion luminescence 

through C-H bond vibrational energy manifolds is avoided 
using a stable chelate where the CH and CH₂ groups in the 

vicinity of the emittive ion are substituted with CD and CD₂ 
groups hence producing improved luminescence quantum yield 

and higher assay sensitivities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel highly luminescent 
lanthanide chelates and a method for their preparation. The 
invention further relates to novel detectable molecules 
comprising said lanthanide chelates attached to a 
biospecific binding reactant. The invention further relates 
to novel chelating agents useful in the preparation of said 
chelates. The publications and other materials used herein to 
illuminate the background of the invention, and in 
particular, cases to provide additional details respecting 
the practice, are incorporated by reference. In the specific binding assays, such as e.g. immunoassays, 
DNA hybridization assays, receptor-binding assays, and 
cellular binding assays, generally the analytes to be 
measured are present at very low concentrations. Therefore 
various labelling compounds have been developed that allow 
the labelled reactant to be detected and quantitated at a 
high sensitivity. Originally, radioisotopic labels were 
solely used, but recently, because of the limitations of 
those labels (such as limited shelf life, safety, health 
and waste problems and so on) a number of non-radioactive 
alternatives have been introduced. Fluorometry is a 
versatile label technology found wide applications in a 
number of analytical assays based on bioaffinity reactions, 
such as in situ hybridization, immunohisto and 
cytochemistry, and also in quantitative fluoroimmunoassays. 
Although theoretically very sensitive, fluorometric 
determination is very vulnerable to interferences caused by  
 
background sources (Soini, E. and Hemmilä, I., 1979, Clin 
Chem 25; 353). Application of delayed detection of fluorescence excited 
with a short pulse is a frequently used system to avoid 
background problems by taking advantage of the temporal 
separation of specific fluorescence from unspecific 
background interference of shorter decay-time (Hemmilä, I., 
1991, Applications of Fluorescence in Immunoassays, Wiley, 
New York). The system requires, however, a photoluminescent 
(referred in the context of this text simply as 
luminescent) label having an excited state lifetime clearly 
longer than the average background noise. Therefore, the 
research is focused in developing luminescent lanthanide 
chelates, which because of the electronic structure of the 
ions, have unique luminescence properties including 
exceptionally long decay times ranging from microseconds to 
milliseconds. A system based on two different chelates, one 
optimized for labelling and the other for fluorometric 
de
