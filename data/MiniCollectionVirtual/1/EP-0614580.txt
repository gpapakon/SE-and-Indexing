<ABSTRACT>
An inverter is to be constructed so as to minimise parasitic inductances while dispensing with supplementary circuits for the IGBT modules and, despite compact construction, to make the components easily accessible with simple assembly. For an inverter, especially a 3-point inverter with semiconductor valve components arranged on cooling units, this is achieved by the use of low-inductance multi-layer conductor routing for the general electrical connection and the production of internal electrical links in the use of multi-layer connecting tracks (51, 53) in vertical array, in which, with a continuous central main connecting track (51) which projects beyond the assembly plane of the coolers (50) and with several and at least 3 secondary connecting tracks (53) intersecting at right angles which electrically are connected to the main connecting track (51) and have the same form, an electrically and mechanically identical structure with compartmentation is achieved, whereby the branch valves and other circuit components of the inverter are assembled in phases in the compartments which are freely accessible towards the assembly plane (M) of the coolers (50) and are connected at that point to the secondary connecting tracks.

Build-up of an inverter, in particular a 3-point inverter, in which 
the required semiconductor valves and further circuit elements are 

accommodated on cooling bodies and a build-up, which is alike in 
electrical and mechanical aspects, is achievable by several mutually 

crossing connecting rails with a compartmental division, in which the 
semiconductor valves and further circuit elements are connectable 

combined phase by phase to the connecting rails, characterised thereby, 
that all connecting rails are constructed as low-inductance multilayer 

connecting rails (51 or 53) and each arranged in vertical upright 
setting, wherein a central continuous multilayer main connecting rail 

(51), at which positive, negative and zero potential of a direct 
voltage source is present, is arranged between two cooling bodies (50) 

lying one beside the other and in that case projects beyond the upper 
assembly plane (M) of the cooling bodies (50), that at least 3 

multilayer auxiliary connecting rails (53) are provided, which 
constructed in like manner cross the multilayer main connecting rail 

(51) at right angles in recesses (58) and are electrically connected to the 
multilayer main connecting rail (51) and that the compartments, which 

are formed by way of the multilayer auxiliary connecting rails (51, 53) 
are freely accessible in the direction towards the upper assembly plane 

(M) of the cooling bodies (50) for an arrangement and assembly, alike 
phase by phase, of the semiconductor valves and further circuit 

elements on the upper assembly plane (M) of the cooling bodies (50) as 
well as for correspondingly alike electrical connections at the 

conductors of the multilayer auxiliary connecting rails (53). 
Build-up of an inverter according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby, that each two compartments adjoining the multilayer main 

connecting rail (51) at both sides form a pair, in which the 
semiconductor valves (for example 5, 6/7, 8 or 52) and further circuit 

elements (for example 3/4 or 56) of one phase (for example R) are 
accommodated and connected.  

 
Build-up of an inverter according to claim 1 or 2, characterised

electrically connected by means of straps (54, 55) arranged thereover 

to an associated multilayer auxiliary connecting rail (53). 
Build-up of an inverter according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby, that the conductors of the multilayer auxiliary 

connecting rails (53) are screw-fastened by way of bent-over connecting 
straps at the connecting places (A, B, C) to t
he associated conductors 
of like potential of the multilayer main connecting rail (51). 
Build-up of an inverter according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised thereby, that the mains capacitors (1, 2) are 

accommodated on that cooling rib side of both the cooling bodies (50), 
which is remote from the assembly side (M), where they lie one against 

the other facing by the connection sides and are connected with the 
connecting straps of the central continuous multilayer main connecting 

rail (51). 
Build-up of an inverter according to claim 5, characterised 
thereby, that in particular for 3-point inverter, the mains capacitors 

(1, 2) consist of the groups (1', 2'), which are connected with the 
multilayer main connecting rail (51).

characterised thereby, that the cooling bodies (50) form the cover 

plate of a housing, in which the cooling ribs lie in a cooling channel 
flowed through by a cooling medium.
