<ABSTRACT>
In a device for regulating the reduction ratio of an infinitely variable transmission, a stationary speed of rotation set value of a driving motor is taken from a three-dimensional characteristic field of operation. The stationary speed of rotation set value is supplied to a signal input of a set value filter (3). This set value filter (3) allows the evolution of an instationary speed of rotation set value to be modified by appropriate association with an indicial response when the stationary speed of rotation set value is abruptly changed. A regulation strategy can thus be achieved for ensuring a static and dynamic regulation behaviour which takes into account the subjective driving feeling and economic considerations.

Device for regulating the transmission ratio of an 
infinitely variable transmission in a vehicle with a driving 

motor and an output regulating system of which speed of 
rotation set values of the driving motor are predetermined by 

an accelerator pedal and are compared with measured speed of 
rotation actual values of the driving motor, with an adjusting 

device for changing the transmission ratio of the infinitely 
variable transmission to which adjustment signals (u) of a 

speed regulator (5) are supplied according to the differences 
in speed of rotation set values and actual values, with a set 

value filter (3) provided with an unsteady speed of rotation 
set value (nM-set-dyn) varied according to a transient 

function at its output and wherein a control difference (xD) 
formed from the unsteady speed of rotation set value (nM-set-dyn) 

and the speed of rotation actual value (nM) of the 
driving motor is fed to the speed regulator (5), wherein the 

trend of the unsteady speed of rotation set value (nM-set-dyn) 
during an abrupt change in a stationary speed of rotation set 

value (nM-set) can be varied as a function of specific 
operating states by allocation of a transient function, 

wherein the set value filter (3) encloses a first order delay 
element (PT1-element) of which the time constant (t1) is 

variable as a function of specific operating states, 
characterised in that a stationary speed of rotation set value 

(nM-set) is inferred from an operating characteristic map 
which relates to an allocation of the position (α-DK) of the 

output regulating system and the vehicle speed (vF) to speed 
of rotation set values (nM-set) and is supplied to the signal 

input of the set value filter (3), wherein, for the specific 

operating state of the pulling operation, the time constant 
(t1) is inferred from a characteristic map memory (11) with a 

characteristic map which relates to an allocation between an 
unsteady speed of rotation set value (nM-set-dyn) and the 

difference (Δ-nM-set) from the stationary speed of rotation 
set value and the unsteady speed of rotation set value (nM-set-dyn) 

of the driving motor (nM-set) and, for the specific 
operating state of the over-run the time constant (t1) is  

 
inferred from a characteristic map memory (12) with a 

characteristic map which relates to an allocation between an 
unsteady speed of rotation set value (nM-set-dyn) and the 

vehicle speed (vF) and, for the specific operating state kick-down, 
the time constant (t1) is inferred from a characteristic 

curve memory (13) with a characteristic curve which is a 
function of the actual speed of rotation (nM) of the driving 

motor. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that with 
the set value filter (3), to the first order delay element 

(PT1 element) there is connected in series a further first 
order delay element (8) of which the time constant and of 

which the transient function trend emerges from the product of 
the first time constants (t1) with a tuning factor (k). 
Device according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that, for predetermining the time constants (t1) dependent on 

specific operating states, a structure selector (10) is 
provided which connects the characteristic map or 

characteristic curve memories (11, 12, 13) to the set value 
filter (3).
