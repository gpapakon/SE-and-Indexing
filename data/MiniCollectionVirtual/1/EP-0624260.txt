<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to negative working color proofing sheet constructions which, upon exposure to an actinic radiation source through a screened image, can accurately reproduce said image. The construction is useful as a color proofing film which can be employed to accurately predict the image quality from a lithographic printing process. The image is produced by forming a composite of a receiver sheet, an adhesive layer, a color layer and cover sheet. Upon imagewise exposure, a negative image appears on the receiver base after dry peel apart development.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to color proofing 
films, or more particularly to a negative working, peel-apart 
photosensitive element capable of producing 
negative images upon treatment with actinic radiation and 
peel development. In the graphic arts, it is desirable to produce a 
three or more color proof to assist in correcting a set 
of color separation films prior to using them to produce 
printing plates. The proof should reproduce the color 
quality that will be obtained during the printing 
process. The proof must be a consistent duplicate of the 
desired halftone image. Visual examination of a color 
proof should show the color rendition to be expected from 
press printing using the color separations and any 
defects on the separations which might need to be altered 
before making the printing plates. Color proofing sheets for multicolored printing can 
be made by using a printing press or proof press. This 
requires that all of the actual printing steps be 
performed. Therefore, this conventional method of color 
proofing is costly and time consuming. Photoimaging processes can also be used to produce a 
color proof. There are two general types of photoimaging 
methods, namely the overlay type and the single sheet 
type. In the overlay type of color proofing method, an 
independent transparent plastic support is used for  
 
producing an image of each color separation film by 
applying a photosensitive solution of the corresponding 
color. A plurality of such supports carrying images of 
the corresponding colors are then superimposed upon each 
other over a white sheet to produce a color proofing 
composite. The primary advantage of the overlay method 
is that proofs can be made quickly and can serve as a 
progressive proof by combining any two or three colors in 
register. However, this type of color proofing method 
has the disadvantage that the superimposed plastic 
supports tend to darken the color proofing sheet. As a 
result, the impression of the color proofing composite 
thus prepared is vastly different from that of copies 
actually obtained with conventional printing presses and 
with proof presses. Examples of such overlay approaches 
are contained in U.S. Patents 3,136,637; 3,211,553; and 
3,326,682. In the single sheet type of color proofing method, a 
color proofing sheet is prepared by successively 
producing images of different colors from different color 
separation films on a single receiver sheet. This can be 
accomplished by sequentially applying colorants or 
colored,
