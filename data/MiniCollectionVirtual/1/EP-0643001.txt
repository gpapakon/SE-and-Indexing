<ABSTRACT>
In a sheet gripper (3) for a sheet processing machine, a pivotable gripper arm (4) has at one end a gripper tip (5) which can be pressed against an abutment and, at its other end, a spring region (7) which is bent back towards the gripper tip (5) in the manner of a bent leaf spring and which connects the gripper arm (4) to a gripper shaft. The gripper arm (4) is designed to be resistant to bending and the bent-back spring region (7) rests on the side, opposite the gripper tip (5), of a plane which is perpendicular to the gripper arm (4) and radial relative to the gripper shaft (1). The bent-back end of the spring region (7) forms an attachment arm (8) which rests with a contact surface, adapted to the curvature of the surface of the gripper shaft (1), on the side of the gripper shaft (1) facing the gripper arm (4) and is releasably attached to the gripper shaft (1) by means of a screw (11).

Sheet gripper (3) for a sheet processing machine 
which has a swivellable one-piece constructed 

gripper arm (4), which has at its one end a gripper 
tip (5) which can be pressed against an abutment and 

at its other end (6) a spring region (7) bent back 
towards the gripper tip (5) in the form of a bent 

leaf spring, which connects the gripper arm (4) with 
the gripper shaft (1), characterised in that the 

gripper arm (4) is constructed stiff to bending and 
that the bent back spring region (7) lies on the 

opposite side to the gripper tip (5) of a plane 

perpendicular to the gripper arm (4) and radial to 
the gripper shaft (1). 
Sheet gripper according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the gripper arm (4) runs tangentially to the 

gripper shaft (1), wherein the distance between the 
gripper arm (4) and gripper shaft (1) at the closest 

place is substantially smaller than the opening 
width of the bent back spring region (7). 
Sheet gripper according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the closest place between the gripper arm (4) 

and the gripper shaft (1) lies between the ends of 
the gripper arm (4), particularly between the centre 

of the gripper arm (4) and the spring region (7). 
Sheet gripper according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the bent back end of 

the spring region forms a fixing arm (8) which lies 
with an abutment surface matched to the curvature of 

the surface of the gripper shaft (1) on the side of 
the gripper shaft (1) curved towards the gripper arm 

(4) and is releasably fixed by means of screw (11) 
to the gripper shaft (1).  

 
Sheet gripper according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the bent spring region 

(7) includes an angle of more than 180Â° and that the 
fixing arm (8) and the gripper arm (4) merge 

tangentially into the spring region (7). 
Sheet gripper according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that at the outer end of the fixing arm (8), a screw 

hole (10) is provided for the passage of a screw 
(11) which can be screwed into the gripper shaft 

(1). 
Sheet gripper according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that between the head of the screw (11) and the 

fixing arm (8), there is provided an underlay disc 
(12) with an abutment surface matched to the 

curvature of the fixing arm (8). 
Sheet gripper according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that a clearance hole (13) is provided in the 

gripper arm (4) above the screw hole (10). 
Sheet gripper according to Claim 8, characterised in 
that the gripper arm (4) in the region of the 

passage hole (13) is broadened in the axial 
direction of the gripper shaft (4). 
Sheet gripper according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the gripper arm (4) is 

bent towards the gripper shaft (1), wherein the 
bending position (9) lies opposite the fixing 

position of the fixing arm (8). 
Sheet gripper according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that along the side edges 

of the gripper arm (4) side walls (14, 15) are 
provided which extend towards the gripper shaft (1).  

 
Sheet gripper according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the gripper arm (4) 

with its side walls (14, 15) surrounds the fixing 
arm (8) and in the radial direction with respect to 

the gripper shaft (4) is guided on the fixing arm 
(8). 
Sheet gripper according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the gripper arm (4) 

has abutment surfaces which may be laid against the 
gripper shaft (1).
