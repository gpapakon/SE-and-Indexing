<ABSTRACT>
A multi-bit digitizer (30) for a barcode reader 
detects the presence of edges of a scanned barcode 

symbol, and also measures the strength of each detected 
edge. A polarity or edge direction signal (8) indicates 

the direction of each detected edge, and a timing signal 
(6) is representative of the timing and also, by means of 

a variable pulse width, the strength of each edge. A 
gating signal (200) indicates that the data are 

unreliable and invalid if the measured voltage applied to 
the scanner motor of the barcode reader is higher or 

lower than defined limit values. Any scans made at a 
speed which were too high or too low are rejected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
bar code reader which detects bar code
symbols which are generally printed on a label or on the
surface of an article. More particularly, but not
exclusively, the subject invention pertains to a
bar code reader having a digitizer as described which detects the presence of
edges in a bar code symbol and also measures the amplitude, or strength,
of each detected edge.Various optical readers and optical scanning systems
have been developed heretofore for reading bar code
symbols appearing on a label or on the surface of an
article. The bar code symbol itself is a coded pattern
of indicia comprised of a series of bars of various
widths spaced apart from one another to bound spaces of
various widths, the bars and spaces having different
light-reflecting characteristics. The readers and
scanning systems electro-optically transform the graphic
indicia into electrical signals, which are decoded into
alphanumerical characters that are intended to be
descriptive of the article of some characteristic
thereof. Such characters are typically represented in
digital form and utilized as an input to a data
processing system for applications in point-of-sale
processing, inventory control, and the like. Scanning
systems of this general type have been disclosed, for
example, in US Patents 4,251,798; 4,369,361; 4,387,297;
4,409,470; 4,760,248; and 4,896,026.As disclosed in some of the above patents, one
embodiment of such a scanning system resides, inter alia, 
in a hand-held, portable laser scanning head supported by
a user, which is configured to allow the user to aim the
head, and more particularly, light beam, at a target and
a symbol to be read.The light source in a laser scanner is typically a
gas laser or semiconductor laser. The use of a
semiconductor device such as a laser diode as the light
source in scanning systems is especially desirable
because of their small size, low cost and low power
requirements. The laser beam is optically modified,
typically by a lens, to form a beam spot of a certain
size at the target distance. It is preferred that the
beam spot size at the target distance be approximately
the same as the minimum width between regions of
different light reflectivity, i.e., the bars and spaces
of the symbol.Bar code symbols are formed from bars or elements
that are typically rectangular in shape with a variety of
possible widths. The specific arrangement of elements
defines the character represented according to a set of
rules and definitions specified by
