<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a process for the preparation of 3,3-diaryl acrylic acid amides of general formula (I) in which A, B and Q are as defined in the specification, by condensing a compound of formula (II) with a compound of the formula CH3-CO-Q in which Q has the meaning given above, in a solvent in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide, characterised in that the solvent is selected from alkanes, cycloalkanes or mixtures thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a new process for the preparation of 
3,3-diaryl acrylic acid amides of the general formula I 
 
in which 
A represents 
 
B represents 
 
and 
Q represents 
 
where 
R1 represents a C1-4 alkyl, C1-4 alkoxy, amino, mono- or 
di-(C1-4 alkyl)amino, C2-4 alkenyl, C3-4 alkynyl, C3-4 alkenyloxy, 
C3-4 alkynyloxy or C3-6 cycloalkyl group;  R2 represents a C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 alkoxy group or a halogen 
atom;  R3 represents a hydrogen or halogen atom; R4 represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a C1-4 alkyl or 
C1-4 alkoxy group;  
 R5 represents a hydrogen atom, a phenyl group optionally 
substituted by one or more substituents selected from C1-4 alkyl, 
C1-4 alkoxy, halogen, phenyl and phenoxy moieties, a C1-12 alkyl 
group optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms, a C3-7 
cycloalkyl group, a C2-6 alkenyl or a C2-6 alkynyl group each 
optionally substituted by a phenyl group, or a naphthyl or C5-8 
cycloalkenyl group; -X-Y- represents a single bond or a -O-, -S(O)p-, -N=N-, 
-CHR10 -O-, -O-CHR10-, -CHR10-S(O)p-, -S(O)p-CHR10-, -CnH2n-, 
-HC=CH- or -C≡C- moiety, in which moieties p represents 0, 1 or 2 
and n represents an integer from 1 to 10; R6 represents a C1-4 alkyl, C3-7 cycloalkyl, benzyl, C3-4 
alkenyl or C3-4 alkynyl group; R7 represents a C1-4 alkyl group; R8 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 alkoxy 
group; and R9 and R10 independently represent a hydrogen atom or a C1-4 
alkyl group. Compounds of formula I are fungicidally active and are 
particularly useful in the control of phytopathogenic fungi, 
especially Plasmoparaviticola and Phytophthorainfestans. 
Particularly preferred compounds of formula I in this respect are 
those in which A represents a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl, 3-ethoxy-4-methoxyphenyl, 
3-chloro-4-methoxyphenyl, 3-bromo-4-methoxyphenyl, 
3-methyl-4-methoxyphenyl, 3-ethyl-4-methoxyphenyl, 
3-propyl-4-methoxyphenyl, 3,4-dimethylphenyl, 3-amino-4-methoxyphenyl, 
3,5-dichloro-4-aminophenyl or 3-methoxy-4-methylphenyl 
group and, of these, 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl is especially preferred, 
and B represents 4-chlorophenyl or 4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl. It is 
also preferred that Q represents a morpholino group. Especially 
preferred compounds of the general formula I are 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) 
acrylic acid morpholide and 
3-[4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl]-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) acrylic acid 
morpholide.  
 Compounds of the general formula I as well as processes for 
their preparation have been described in European patent 
applicatio
