<ABSTRACT>
Thermal transfer oil (4) formed by laminating a mold releasing layer (4b) about 0.02 µm in thickness, a 
transparent colored protective layer (4c) about 2 µm in thickness, a reflecting layer (4d) about 0.03-0.05 µm in 

thickness and a layer (4e) of a thermoplastic resin on one surface of a base film (4a) about 12-25 µm in thickness is 
laminated on a substrate (11) consisting of a metal sheet constituting a dial of a timepiece. The base film (4a) is then 

removed from the transfer foil (4), which is thereafter thermally pressed by a mold (21). A pressing surface (22) of 
the mold (21) has a fine uneven pattern, which is transferred to the colored protective layer (4c), reflecting layer (4d) 

and layer (4e) of a thermoplastic resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method of forming coloured relief-and-indentation patterns that 
provide coloured relief-and-indentation patterns on timepiece face plates and other 
components, and a thermal transfer foil used in those patterns; in particular, it concerns a 
technique of producing extremely small relief-and-indentation patterns. As shown in Figure 6 (a) of the accompanying drawings, in the field of thermal transfer 
printing a thermal transfer foil (50), made by stacking the following layers on a base film 
(53) 12 µm to 25µm thick, is used: a protective colouring layer (52) consisting of a 
colourless transparent, coloured transparent, or coloured semi-transparent resin layer 
approximately 2 µm thick or greater; and a reflection layer (51) consisting of a vapour-deposited 
aluminium thin-film layer 0.03 µm to 0.05 µm thick. On this thermal transfer 
foil (50), a thin, separable processing layer (54) is formed between the protective 
colouring layer (52) and the base film (53). A bonding layer (55) is formed beneath the 
reflection layer (51). Also, as shown in Figure 6 (b), in some cases a thermal transfer 
foil (50a) is used, which is called a pigment foil, made with a pigment (56), which is a 
combination of the protective colouring layer and the reflection layer. Of these thermal transfer foils, if a coloured relief-and-indentation pattern is printed 
using the thermal transfer foil (50), first, a thermoplastic resin layer (61) is formed on 
the surface to be decorated on the substrate (60), as shown in Figure 7 (a). If the surface 
to be decorated of the substrate (60) itself consists of a thermoplastic resin, the provision 
of the thermoplastic resin layer (61) is not necessary. Next, as shown in Figure 7 (b), 
the thermal transfer foil (50) is superimposed on the thermoplastic resin layer (61) of the 
substrate (60). Under these conditions the thermal transfer foil (50) is heat-pressed using  
 
the mould (62). This results in the transfer of the relief-and-indentation patterns (3D 
patterns) on the pressing surface of the mould (62) from the protective colouring layer 
(52) to the thermoplastic resin layer (61). When the base film (53) is peeled off, the 
coloured relief-and-indentation pattern is copied onto the surface of the substrate (60) as 
shown in Figure 7 (c). Because the method of forming coloured relief-and-indentation 
patterns using the thermal transfer foil (50) can thus easily form coloured relief-and-indentation 
patterns, if fine relief-and-indentation patterns (3D
