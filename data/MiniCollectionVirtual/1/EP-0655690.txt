<ABSTRACT>
A computer system includes a data processing module 
(10) which is selectively mated with any one of a number of 

associated computer base units (12), such as a portable PC 
base unit (36) and a desktop PC base unit (46). The data 

processing module (10) incorporates essential elements 
required for operation of a computer including a processor 

(14), a hard disk (18) and a memory (16). The 
processor/memory/disk module (10) is readily removable from 

a base unit (12) so as selectively to be coupled to any 
desired base unit (12) for operation of that base unit (12), 

or to be removed and put away for security purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data processing
system and, in particular, to a system incorporating a data
processing module.In the field of personal computers (PCs), there are two
broad categories, namely portable PCs and desktop PCs. Each
of these categories has certain advantages over the other.
For example, the portable PC has the advantages that it can
be taken with the user on business trips, can be used in
areas where standard household current is not available, and
is relatively small and light in weight. On the other hand,
the desktop PC is not dependent on a battery having a
limited life, normally has a larger display, has an easier-to-use
keyboard and "mouse", can be permanently connected to
a network which includes a printer and other desirable
peripheral units, and may have higher capabilities in terms
of such things as memory and processing power, etc.In the past, there have been attempts to combine the
functions of portable PCs with those of desktop PCs. These
have generally been docking station or cable management
concepts which usually lead to clumsy and expensive
interconnections and wasted desk space.Moreover EP-A-0 378 282 describes a portable hard disk
drive module which permits hard disks to be interchangeable
between computer systems. The module encloses all of the
operative components of the disk drive and is removably
received in a receptacle in a microcomputer system. The
module and the receptacle each have an electrical connector
and these connectors serve as the sole interface and are
coupled when the module is in an operating position within
the receptacle.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
system which has the advantages of both portable PCs and
desktop PCs without the attendant disadvantages of increased
cost and wasted desk space. According to the present invention there is provided a data
processing system, comprising a plurality of data processing
base units and a data processing module interchangeable
between the base units and adapted to be operably and
detachably connected to one of the second base units to
provide an operable data processing device, characterised in
that the data processing module comprises at least the main
processor of the system and a non-volatile memory. An embodiment of the present invention will now be
described, by way of example, with reference to the
accompanying drawings in which:-
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a processor, hard drive
and memory module and an associated PC base unit;Fig. 2 is a perspective view

<CLAIMS>
A data processing system comprising a plurality of data
processing base units (12) and a data processing module (10)

interchangeable between the base units and adapted to be
operably and detachably connected to one of the second base

units to provide an operable data processing device,
characterised in that the data processing module (10)

comprises at least the main processor (14) of the system and
a non-volatile memory (16).
A system according to claim 1, characterized in that
one of the data processing base units (12) is included in a

first computer (36) designed for portable use and having a
receptacle (42) for receiving the data processing module

(10), another of the data processing base units is included
in a computer (46) designed for stationary use and having a

receptacle (52) for receiving the data processing module
(10), and the data processing module (10) can be placed in

the receptacle of either said first or said second computer
(36,46) and operatively engaged with the base unit (12) of

that computer to provide an operable data processing device.
A system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that each base unit (12) includes a keyboard controller

(32), a floppy disk controller (30), an interface (26) for
connection to the data processing module (10) and a bus (28)

coupling said keyboard controller (32), said floppy disk
controller (30) and said interface (26).
A system according to claim 3, characterized in that
each base unit (132) also includes an I/O controller and an

LCD/CRT controller (33) coupled to said bus (28). 
A system according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that the data processing module (10)

includes a system controller (20), a hard disk unit (18), an
interface (22) for connection to a base unit and a bus

coupling the processor (14), the non-volatile memory (16),
the system controller (20), the hard disk unit (18) and the

interface (22).
