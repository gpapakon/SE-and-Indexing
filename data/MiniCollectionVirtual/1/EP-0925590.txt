<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE POLYETHER POLYURETHANESTechnical Field of the InventionThe present invention is directed to a process for producing conductive and semi-conductive polyurethane materials. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method of incorporating a conductive moiety into an isocyanate terminated polyalkyleneether polyol prepolymer to provide a polyether polyurethane material that controls electrostatic discharge while retaining its performance properties. Background of the Invention A noteworthy problem in the modern electronic age is the buildup and discharge of static electricity. It has long been known that static charges, which develop between isolated bodies, are discharged when those bodies are brought into close proximity. Potentials as high as 30,000 volts have been reportedly generated by a person walking on a synthetic carpet.Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can affect electronic equipment in which semiconductor devices are used. Particular problems are found in computer systems, telecommunications equipment, guidance systems, medical equipment and in a variety of other industrial environments. Amongst these industrial applications are printing rolls, safety shoe soling, copy machine rolls, and factory vehicle wheels. In factory environments, ESD is a safety concern when sparks from equipment such as trucks can ignite vessels or reactors containing flammable material such as solvents. A static discharge of a few hundred volts can severely damage or ruin expensive electronic equipment or destroy stored computer data.There are known classes of materials available for ESD protection. One type are plastics or elastomers which are impregnated with conductive carbon black. These require high loading - about 20-30 phr would be typical. This amount of carbon black is not usually practicable for reasons of high cost, the dark color of the impregnated article, and the fact that the properties of the elastomer may be compromised due to this 

high loading.Conductive materials can also be made of inherently conductive polymers. Such conductive polymers include polyacetylene, polyphenylene, and polypyrrole. Dopants such as AsF3, substituted quinones, FeCI3, HCIO4, BF4 or iodine may be added to improve conductivity. However, stability and compatibility problems as well as high cost and limited availability have limited the use of these materials for industrial ESD protection.Charge dissipative materials achieve their electrical conductivities through the use of topical chemicals
