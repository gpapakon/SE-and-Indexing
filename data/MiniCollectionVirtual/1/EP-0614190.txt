<ABSTRACT>
A memory-store component has a rectangular-shaped semiconductor substrate containing active memory-store circuits and bearing, on a large face, output pins (14). This large face is covered with an insulating layer bearing metallic linkage tracks (20) joining, without crossing over, the output pins (14) to connection areas (16) arranged on the said large face along only one of the large sides of the substrate. A memory module can comprise several such components on a patchboard.

Memory module comprising, on an interconnection
support, a plurality of memory components, all having a same

elongated shape, two successive components being stacked in
a same angular position, each component having a rectangular

semiconductor substrate containing active memory circuits
and having output terminals (14) on a major surface thereof

which is coated by an insulating layer carrying metal
connection leads (20) connecting the output terminals (14)

to connection pads (16) located on said major surface along
only one of longer sides of the substrate,

   characterised in that two successive components are
mutually offset for the connection pads (16,18) of one

component to be located beyond the component located above
it in the stack and in that each substrate has additional

pads (18) which are in addition to the connection pads (16)
connected to terminals (14) and distributed among them.
Module according to claim 1, wherein said substrate
has such a width that the connection pads (16) are beyond

the zone which contains the active circuits.
Memory module comprising, on an interconnection
support (26), a plurality of memory components, all having a

same elongated shape, two successive components being
stacked in a same angular position, each component having a

rectangular semiconductor substrate containing active memory
circuits and having output terminals (14) on a major surface

thereof which is coated by an insulating layer carrying
metal connection leads (20) connecting the output terminals

(14) to connection pads (16) located on said major surface
along only one of longer sides of the substrate,

   characterised in that two successive components are
mutually offset for the connection pads (16,18) of one 

component to be located beyond the component located above
it in the stack and in that all metal leads are located

above the zone which contains the active circuits.
Module according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised
in that the metal connection leads are devoid of mutual

crossing.
Module according to any one of claims 1-4,
characterised in that the interconnection support carries

conducting tracks (28) on that lateral portion of the major
surface thereof which receives the stack, the lowest

component (10
4
) being offset with respect to the edge.
Module according to claim 5, characterised in that
the support also carries additional conducting tracks (29)

on the major surface opposed to the surface which receives
the stack, and connections are formed between the conducting

tracks on both sides of the support (26) via metal plated
holes (30).
Module according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in
that connections with the outside consist of flexible wires

(32) soldered on the conductive tracks (28).
Module according to claim 5, 6 or 7, characterised
in that wiring for mutually connecting the components and

connecting the lowest component to the support consist of
short lengths of electrically insulated wire, the input-outputs

and common power supplies being wired serially
between the components and the support.
Module according to claim 1 and any one of claims 5-8,
characterised in that the specific inputs and outputs are

wired while avoiding any direct connection between the
components and the outside, by using relaying additional

pads (18) which are connected to leads.
