<ABSTRACT>
A device for sterilizing a soft lens by boiling, 
which is provided with: a body proper (2); 

a lid body (3) to be liquid-tightly sealed against 
the body proper (2); electrodes (13) for supplying 

electric current to solution (E) containing 
electrolyte in said body proper (2); and a gas 

permeating film (6) allowing gas and steam generated 
by electrolysis and by boiling of said solution 

(E) when current is supplied to pass 
through it toward the outside of the container 

(1) but not allowing liquid to pass; and, thus, 
the device is suitable for storing and carrying 

the lens, superior in heating efficiency for boiling, 
and capable of preventing abnormal heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a boiling 
device (to be simply called "device" hereinbelow) for 
sterilizing a soft contact lens. More particularly, it 
relates to a device for use in sterilizing, carrying and 
preserving a soft contact lens (to be simply called "lens" 
hereinbelow). Conventionally, boiling for sterilizing a lens 
is conducted by accommodating the lens together with a 
preservative solution within a sealed container and 
heating the container from outside with a heating element 
such as an electric heater to boil the preservative 
solution therein (referred to as "prior art 1" 
hereinbelow). Alternatively, there is known a device which 
uses a container having a usual opening on which a simple 
lid member is disposed (Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Application No. 110035/1989). In this device a lens is 
accommodated together with a cleaning solution within the 
container having a pair of electrodes therein, then 
electricity is made to flow through the cleaning solution 
to heat the solution owing to its own electrical 
resistance, thereby sterilizing the lens by boiling 
(referred to as "prior art 2" hereinbelow). In the case of prior art 1, the lens within 
the sealed container is indirectly heated through the 
container. Hence, excessive heating is needed. In 
addition vapor might be produced to raise the pressure 
within the sealed container, resulting in a danger. 
Furthermore, the temperature of the solution is raised to 
above 100Â°C, hence such a high temperature can deteriorate 
the lens rapidly.  In the case of prior art 2, moving the container 
might cause the lid member to come off from the opening 
thereof, which results in spill of the contents. 
Accordingly, the device is unsuitable to be carried and 
cannot be used except when it is placed on a table for 
sterilizing the lens therein. If the container is sealed with the lid member, 
there would arise problems of an excessive rise in 
pressure and excessive heating, like prior art 1. The present invention has been attained to 
overcome the foregoing problems. Thus, it is an object of 
the present invention to provide a compact boiling device 
suitable for carrying and preservation, of which the 
heating efficiency is increased and the internal pressure 
can be prevented from rising. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a device for boiling and sterilizing a soft 
contact lens, which is characterized by comprising a main 
body having an opening for accommodating a solution 
containing an electrolyte, a lid

<CLAIMS>
A device for boiling and sterilizing a soft 
contact lens, which comprises a main body having an 

opening for accommodating a solution containing an 
electrolyte, a lid member for liquid-tightly closing the 

opening of the main body, a pair of electrodes for 
allowing electricity to flow through the solution, and 

ventilation means, which is impermeable with respect to 
liquid and permeable with respect to gas and vapor, for 

allowing escape of gas and vapor produced by electrolysis 
and boiling of the solution to the outside so as to 

mitigate a rise in internal pressure.
