<ABSTRACT>
A self-exciting constant current circuitry comprising first 
and second current mirror circuits (M1, M2) and a voltage 

control device. The first current mirror circuit (M1) is 
connected to a high voltage line supplying a high voltage and 

has an input side through which a first current flows and an 
output side through which a second current flows. The second 

current mirror circuit (M2) is connected to a low voltage line 
supplying a low voltage and has an output side being connected 

through a first node (N1) to the input side of the first current 
mirror circuit (M1) and an input side being connected through a 

second node (N2) to the output side of the first current mirror 
circuit (M1) in which the second current flows through the input 

side of the second current mirror circuit (M2) as well as a 
third current flows through the output side of the second 

current mirror circuit (M2). The voltage control device is 
electrically connected between the first node (N1) and the low 

voltage line for controlling, only in starting the circuitry, a 
potential of the first node (N1) at a predetermined stationary 

potential value where the first and second current mirror 
circuits (M1, M2) are in a stationary and operational state.
