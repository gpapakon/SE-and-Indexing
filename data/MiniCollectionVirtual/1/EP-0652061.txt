<ABSTRACT>
A rotary forging apparatus comprises a first 
rotary ram (3a), a cylindrical second rotary ram (3b), 

a third rotary ram (3c) and a shaping roller device. 
The first ram (3a) and the cylindrical second ram (3b) 

face each other and rotate about a common axis. The 
third ram (3c) is located in the cylindrical second 

ram (3b) and can rotate about an axis inclined to the 
common axis. The third ram (3c) presses a workpiece 

against the first ram (3a) and makes the disc part of 
a product. The shaping roller and the second ram (3b) 

and a side of the first ram make the rim part of the 
product. The outer surface of the second ram (3b) can 

keep a tight contact with the workpiece during the 
forging because of the rotational symmetry of the 

second ram (3b). The overall contact stabilizes the 
position of the workpiece and reduces any size error 

of the product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary forging apparatus 
for making a product having a disc part and a rim part formed 
around the disc part, for example, a wheel of an automobile, from a 
metal suitable for plastic working, for example aluminium alloys by 
hot forging. Japanese Patent Application No.4-307347(307347/'92) 
proposed a rotary forging apparatus. Fig. 1 to Fig. 3 demonstrate 
the rotary forging apparatus making a wheel with a disc part and a 
rim part. The forging apparatus comprises a lower rotary ram (30a) 
having a pressing top surface coinciding with the outer surface of 
a disc part (1) and the inner surface of an outer rim part of an 
automobile wheel, an upper rotary ram (30b) facing the lower ram 
(30a) and having a umbrella-shaped pressing bottom surface formed  
 
after the inner surface of the disc part(1), a shaping roller device 
(4) consisting of a first shaping roller (4a) and a second shaping 
roller (4b) for forming outer surface of the rim part. The upper 
rotary ram (30b) has a rotary axis slightly inclined to the rotary 
axis of the lower ram (30a). The upper ram (30b) is provided with an 
outer surface coinciding with the inner surface of the inner rim and 
the inner surface of the disc part (1). The roller device is 
supported at the height between the upper ram (30b) and the lower 
ram (30a) with a freedom of displacement in the radial direction and 
the axial direction. This apparatus adopts a tray-like metal material (10) 
having a central disc-prototype part (11) and a cylindrical 
rim-prototype part (12) bending at the periphery of the rim part (12) 
as a starting material. A starting material is sometimes called a 
"workpiece (10)" in this description. The final, finsished material is 
sometimes called a "product" in order to distinguish the final 
material from the starting material. The material is gradually and 
continuously transformed from a workpiece to a product without a 
change of weight. A workpiece has a rim prototype part and a disc 
prototype part. A product has a rim part and a disc part. The lower ram (30a) and lower ram (30a) sandwich a  
 
starting material, i.e. a workpiece (10) both from the top and the bottom. 
The outer surface of the upper ram (30b) is in tight contact with 
the inner surface of the rim-prototype part (12) and the 
disc-prototype part (11) only at the axis-inclining direction. The 
synchronously rotating rams (30b) and (30a) press the workpiece (10) 
together with strong forces. The disc-prototype part (11) is 
transformed into
