<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates generally to genetic sequences encoding flavonoid pathway metabolising enzymes and in particular flavonoid glycosylating enzymes and their use such as in manipulating production of pigmentory molecules in plants. More particularly the present invention provides a genetic sequence encoding UDP rhamnose: anthocyanidin-3-glucoside rhamnosyltransferase (3RT).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to genetic sequences encoding flavonoid
pathway metabolising enzymes and in particular flavonoid glycosylating enzymes and
their use such as in manipulating production of pigmentory molecules in plants.Bibliographic details of the publications referred to hereinafter in the specification are
collected at the end of the description. SEQ ID No's referred to herein in relation to
nucleotide and amino acid sequences are defined after the Bibliography.The flower industry strives to develop new and different varieties of flowering plants.
An effective way to create such novel varieties is through the manipulation of flower
colour and classical breeding techniques have been used with some success to
produce a wide range of colours for most of the commercial varieties of flowers. This
approach has been limited, however, by the constraints of a particular species' gene
pool and for this reason it is rare for a single species to have a full spectrum of
coloured varieties. For example, the development of blue varieties of major cutflower
species such as rose, chrysanthemum, tulip, lily, carnation and gerbera would offer a
significant opportunity in both the cutflower and ornamental markets.Flower colour is predominantly due to three types of pigment: flavonoids, carotenoids
and betalains. Of the three the flavonoids are the most common and contribute a
range of colours from yellow to red to blue. The flavonoid molecules which make the
major contribution to flower colour are the anthocyanins which are glycosylated
derivatives of cyanidin, delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin, malvidin and pelargonidin,
and are localised in the vacuole.The flavonoid pigments are secondary metabolites of the phenylpropanoid pathway.
The biosynthetic pathway for the flavonoid pigments ("flavonoid pathway") is well
established, (Ebel and Hahlbrock, 1988; Hahlbrock and Grisebach, 1979: Wiering
and De Vlaming, 1984; Schram et al., 1984; Stafford, 1990) and is shown in Figures
1A and B. Three reactions and enzymes are involved in the conversion of
phenylalanine to p-coumaroyl-CoA, one of the first key substrates in the flavonoid
pathway. The enzymes are phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxvlase
(C4H) and 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL). The first committed step in 
the pathway involves the condensation of three molecules of malonyl-CoA (provided
by the action of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) on acetyl CoA and CO2),with one
molecule of p-coumaroyl-CoA. This reaction is catalysed by the
