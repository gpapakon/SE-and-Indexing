<ABSTRACT>
Machine to sharpen bars to a point, especially bars to be 
drawn, which comprises at least one sharpening assembly and 

at least one assembly for displacement of the bar in 
relation to the sharpening assembly, the sharpening assembly 

(31) consisting of two counterpart rolls (11) each of which 
contains on the plane of positioning of the bar a groove 

(24) including at least two sections of reduction, means 
(14-15) being comprised for the circumferential positioning 

of the rolls (11) at the desired section of reduction, there 
also being included at least one rolling assembly (27a) 

upstream of the sharpening assembly (31) and at least one 
rolling assembly (27b) downstream of the sharpening assembly 

(31), such rolling assemblies (27) operating on the bar on a 
plane substantially at a right angle to the plane of 

reduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a machine to sharpen bars to a 
point, as set forth in the 
precharacterising portion of the 
main claim. To be more exact, 
the machine to sharpen bars according to the invention is 
suitable to reduce the cross-section of the leading end 
segment of bars. Where the sharpening machine is employed in cooperation 
with a drawing machine, the sharpening of the leading end 
segment of bars is necessary to enable the bars to pass 
through the drawing die and to be attached to the drawing 
trolley of the drawing machine. The machine can also be used whenever it is necessary to 
prepare solid or hollow bars with a leading end segment of a 
reduced section. The invention is applied to bars having a round, square, 
polygonal, etc. cross-section. The invention is also applied to the fields of hot drawing 
and cold drawing. The state of the art covers various systems to provide on 
a bar a leading end segment which is compatible with the 
size of the drawing die so as to enable the bar to pass 
through the die and be coupled to the drawing trolley of the 
drawing machine. In a first solution of the problem the state of the art 
arranges to pre-draw the bar by thrusting it against the 
die. In this way the leading segment of the bar is obtained 
by the die itself. This system is restricted to certain 
dimensions of the cross-section of the bar by obvious 
insoluble problems of combined bending and compressive 
stresses and can be employed only with some materials 
inasmuch as a swollen mass often forms upstream of the 
drawing die while the bar is being thrust against the die.  
 A variant of this method disclosed, for instance, in FR-A-942.599 
and DE-B2.758.137 provides for an initial pre-drawing 
and a subsequent drawing by reverse drawing by using 
the drawing die, but this variant too entails the same 
problems as those cited above. A further disclosure of the state of the art arranges to 
weld to the leading end of the bar a stub suitable to 
cooperate with the die, but this system is very expensive 
and slow and entails undesirable structural changes of the 
metal. Another method used is to roll the leading end of the bar 
by using specially shaped and cut rolls and by making the 
bar move forward and rotate about its axis at the same time. 
But this system too is slow, requires a constant control by 
the machine operator and involves problems of the 
homogeneity of the finished product . A further method arranges to remove a shaving from the 
leading end segment of the bar, but here
