<ABSTRACT>
A femoral component for a hip prosthesis has a distal portion defining a 
central longitudinal axis. The component has a generally conically shaped mid-shaft 

portion and a proximal portion with a shape based on the reamer and a shaped 
chisel used by the surgeon to prepare the proximal metaphysis and medullary canal. 

The proximal portion is shaped in a manner wherein a cross-section taken perpendicular 
to the central axis has a medial side formed as a first circular arc, a comer of 

the cross-section formed by the posterior and lateral sides as a second circular arc 
with a center on the central axis. The posterior side is arcuate and concave and 

tangent to the first and second circular arcs, with the anterior side being arcuate and 
convex.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a femoral component for a hip prosthesis to
be used in total hip arthroplasty. More specifically, it relates to a femoral component
having a shape which provides a better fit with the femoral medullary canal.It is possible to eliminate severe pain in hip joints as a result of arthritis or
other infirmities by implanting a stem within a femoral intramedullary canal. A ball
on the proximal end of the stem cooperates with a prosthetic socket implanted in a
prepared natural acetabulum and thereby provides for articulation between the femur
and the acetabulum after the femoral head has been resected and the proximal
femur cleared of cancellous bone proximally and fatty tissue distally.In order to maintain pain-free articulation of the hip joint following prosthesis
implantation, it is essential that fixation be attained between the stem and healthy
bone bed. Such a fastening is accomplished by several methods. A polymethylmethacrylate
cement can act as a bone between the implant and the interstices of
the prepared bone bed. A second method known as press fit relies on the dimensional
difference between the implant and prepared bone bed for stability. A third
fixation method provides a 3-dimensional texture on the implant's surface that, when
used in a "line to line" or slightly undersized prepared bone bed, allows for bony
ingrowth texture.Various patents relate to a femoral component for press fit with and biological
fixation to the wall of the proximal metaphysis and intramedullary canal. For
example, U.S. Patent 4,589,883 teaches a proximal portion which is elliptical in
cross-section with its major and minor axes twisted along the proximal direction.
U.S. Patent 4,435,854 (now Reissue Patent 32,471) relates to a hip joint prosthesis
having a stem which, in its proximal region, has a curvature in the anterior-posterior
plane with a center of curvature anteriorly and, in its distal region, includes a shank 
having a curvature in the opposite direction in the anterior-posterior plane, i.e. at its
center of curvature posteriorly. This design supposedly reduces the tendency of the
shank to turn within the medullary canal.U.S. Patent 5,002,580 relates to a femoral component designed to provide a
non-uniform interference press fit with the intramedullary canal. With this design, the
femoral canal is prepared in such a manner that the prosthesis has line-to-line
contact with cortical bone on the lateral side and produces an interference fit with
the softer cancellous bone on the

<CLAIMS>
A femoral component (10) for a hip prosthesis comprising:

a distal portion (12) defining a central longitudinal axis (18)
of the component for disposition within an intramedullary canal

of the femur, a midstem portion (14), and a proximal portion (16)
having a cross-section (4) perpendicular to the central axis (18)

defining medial (AA-BB), posterior (U-AA), lateral (U-V) and
anterior (V-BB) sides, characterized in that:


a) said medial side (AA-BB) of said proximal portion (16)
being formed as a first circular arc (AA-BB) having a

center located within said cross-section (4), a corner of
said cross-section formed by said posterior (U-AA) and said

lateral (U-V) surfaces formed as a second circular arc (U-T)
with a center on said central axis (18);
b) said anterior side (V-BB) of said proximal portion (16)
being an arc (Y) of a circle having its center on a first plane

(U-V) through said central axis (18) and perpendicular to
a second plane (T-S) containing said central axis (18) and both

said centers of said first (AA-BB) and second (U-T) circular
arcs and being convex in form and tangent to said first

circular arc (AA-BB) at the point of intersection (BB)
therewith;
c) said posterior side (U-AA) of said proximal portion (16)
being an arc of a circle having its center on a third plane (AA-BB)

extending through the center of said first circular arc
