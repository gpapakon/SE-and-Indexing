<ABSTRACT>
A sheet post-processing apparatus is arranged such 
that in the non-staple mode, the leading edges of the 

sheets transported from the transport rollers are directed 
so as to be sandwiched between the upper and lower 

discharge rollers by a movable sheet guide in a non-staple 
mode position and the sheets are discharged onto a 

stacking tray through the upper and lower discharge 
rollers. In the staple mode, the leading edges of the 

sheets is directed to a discharge opening formed between 
the upper discharge roller and the movable sheet guide by 

the movable sheet guide in the staple mode position so as 
to be dropped onto the staple tray. After being processed 

by the stapler, the sheets are pushed by a pushing member 
through the discharge opening onto the stacking tray. As 

a result, the movements of the upper and lower discharge 
rollers are stabilized, and the sheets can be prevented 

from being stuck between the upper and lower discharge 
rollers and or being slanted when being discharged, 

thereby achieving a desirable discharge of the sheets in 
the non-staple mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present intention relates to a sheet
post-processing apparatus
according to the preamble of claim 1.Recently, many copying machines are combined with
sheet post-processing apparatuses with post-processing
functions such as binding or punching sheets having images
copied thereon in order to automate the process.For the conventional sheet post-processing 
apparatuses, for example, European Patent No. 346,851
discloses a sheet post-processing apparatus wherein an
endless transport belt is driven in one direction, and
stapled sheets are discharged from a processing tray onto
a stacking tray by a push-out member provided on the
transport belt. In the above apparatus, the stacking tray
can be raised and lowered so that the top surface of the
sheets stacked on the stacking tray is set at virtually
the same height as the processing tray.Another conventional sheet post-processing apparatus
is known as disclosed in European Patent No. 371,403
wherein a stacking tray can be moved vertically and
horizontally, sheets are placed over the stacking tray and
the processing tray, and after a cycle of copying process
is completed, a set of sheets is stapled and discharged
onto the stacking tray using a discharge roller and
swinging roller or using an ejector. In the
non-processing mode, the swinging roller is brought in
contact with the discharge roller, and sheets fed from the
copying machine main body are discharged onto the stacking
tray, while in the processing mode, the swinging roller is
kept apart from the discharge roller, and sheets fed from
the copying machine main body are temporarily stored on
the processing tray, thereafter, the swinging roller is
brought in contact with the discharge roller so as to 
discharge the sheets onto the stacking tray.U.S. Patent No. 5,137,265 discloses a sheet
post-processing apparatus wherein a recessed portion on
the stacking tray corresponds to a needle for fastening
the sheets in the processing mode. The above apparatus is
also arranged such that in the processing mode, when
transporting sheets which are larger than a predetermined
size, the sheets placed over the processing tray and the
stacking tray are discharged onto the stacking tray by the
discharge roller and the swinging roller, while when
transporting sheets which are smaller than a predetermined
size, sheets remain placed over the post-processing tray
and the stacking tray without being discharged.
Additionally, in the processing mode, an auxiliary tray is
moved to place the stacking tray on an extended line of
the
