<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a composition formed of an aqueous phase and of a fatty phase, the said fatty phase comprising at least one ester, characterised in that the ester has a total number of carbon atoms ranging from 12 to 20, in that it is present at a content chosen from 0.1% to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition and in that the fatty phase represents less than 20% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Another subject of the invention is the use of such a composition as, or in the preparation of, a make-up removing composition. The invention moreover relates to a make-up removing process which uses the said composition and does not require a rinsing operation.
