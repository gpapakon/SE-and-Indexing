<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid jet printing head 
according to the preamble of claim 1 and a liquid jet printing 
apparatus provided therewith. Particularly, the  
 
present invention relates to an improvement in a 
liquid jet printing head for conducting recording by 
discharging and flying through a liquid discharging outlet 
recording liquid (usually, ink) to form a liquid droplet, 
resulting in depositing on the surface of a recording 
material (in the following, this liquid jet printing head 
will be occasionally called "liquid jet recording head"). 
More particularly, the present invention relates to an 
improved liquid jet printing head in which a peripheral 
area of the discharging outlets is applied with specific 
surface treatment. The present invention also relates to a liquid jet 
printing apparatus provided with said improved liquid jet 
printing head. Further, the present invention includes a  
 
process for producing said improved liquid jet printing 
head. Of the presently known various printing systems, the 
ink jet printing system has been evaluated as a very 
effective non-impact printing system in that printing can 
be conducted at a high speed while substantially not 
causing noise. A typical ink jet printing head used in the ink jet 
printing system is of the configuration shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, reference numeral 1 indicates a substrate 
for an ink jet printing head. The substrate is constituted 
by a glass, aluminium or silicon material. Reference 
numeral 4 indicates liquid pathways formed by joining the 
substrate 1 to a top plate 2 provided with a plurality of 
grooves capable of providing said liquid pathways 4. In 
each of the liquid pathways 4, there is installed an energy 
generating element 3 for generating an energy for 
discharging ink. Reference numeral 7 indicates a nozzle 
plate provided with a plurality of discharging outlets 7a 
each being communicated with the corresponding liquid 
pathway 4. The nozzle plate 7 is joined to the assembly 
comprising the substrate 1 and the top plate 2 to establish 
an ink jet printing head. In the ink jet printing head thus configured, when  
 
printing is conducted by discharging ink droplets through 
the discharging outlets of the ink jet printing head, part 
of those ink droplets are sometimes dropped to deposit on 
the discharging outlet face at which the discharging 
outlets are arranged. There is a tendency that such ink 
deposit on the discharging outlet face comes to contact 
with ink droplets successively
