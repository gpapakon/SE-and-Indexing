<ABSTRACT>
A method for processing a leadframe (18) for use with a molded 
package is 

disclosed. In particular, the method is suited for arrangements where 
direct 

wirebond attachment sites (12) are exposed through the molding material. 
Conventional 

molding processes usually result in leaving a residue (26) of molding 
material on the 

exposed wirebond sites (12). The invention is directed to including a 
protective layer (24) of 

material over the wirebond locations (12) during the leadframe (18) 
plating operation. The 

protective layer (24)(and any molding residue (26) covering the 
protective layer) may then be 

removed using an etchant after the molding operation, exposing the 
underlying wirebond contact sites (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to leadframe processing and, more
particularly, to a leadframe metallization technique useful in molded packaging
arrangements.In many current integrated electronic and/or optoelectronic circuit
arrangements, one or more semiconductor components are positioned on a leadframe
and encased in a package so as to form, for example, a single in-line package (SIP)
or dual in-line package (DIP) structure. The package may be, in some cases, molded
from a plastic to completely encase the circuit components. Typically, electrical
signals are transmitted to/from such a molded package to an associated circuit board
by a plurality of leads which comprise the package leadframe structure. However, in
some cases, the need arises to provide a direct electrical contact between the molded
package and another device without passing the connection through the circuit board
(e.g., in situations where the signal degradation associated with the circuit board is
unacceptable).A problem with the direct wirebond connection is that an essentially
clean wirebond contact on the molded package is required to provide the necessary
electrical and mechanical integrity. However, inherent in the molding operation is
the residue and/or bleed of molding compound, a resin, which will adhere to the
exposed wirebond surface. Conventional cleaning agents, which may be capable of
removing the resin from the exposed gold wirebond pad sites, are not acceptable
alternatives since they have been found to attack the molded plastic package and/or
gold wirebond contact, as well as require a one-at-a-time cleaning process (costly as
compared to a "batch" cleaning system).EP-A-0 354 800 relates to processes for
hermetically sealing semiconductor devices. As taught,
electrical connection between a leadframe (extending
through a package sidewall) and an enclosed
semiconductor device can be improved by coating the
leadframe with a high molecular substance (defined in
the disclosure as "thermoplastic resins" or 
"thermosetting resins") prior to forming the molded
package. Subsequent to the package molding operation,
the high molecular substance is removed from the
leadframe using a suitable solvent.US-A-4 968 397 describes a leadframe cleaning
method wherein extraneous package flashing is removed
using an etchant consisting of a water solution of metal
lactates (or lactic acid) and metal hydroxides.A need remains, therefore, for a method of
improving the electrical quality of wirebond attachments
to leadframes utilized in molded

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing a leadframe (18) having
wirebond sites for use in a resin package, the method

comprising the steps of:

a) providing said leadframe,
b) selectively plating said wirebond sites
with gold (24);
c) covering the gold-plated wirebond sites with
a layer of copper (24);
d) encasing the gold and copper plated leadframe using a resin
molding process to form said resin package, said processing leaving a

coating (26) over said wirebond sites;
e) subsequent to the encasing of step
d), etching said copper with an etchant comprising

essentially 10% ammonium hydroxide and 10% HC1 to remove
and to expose the underlying gold material.
