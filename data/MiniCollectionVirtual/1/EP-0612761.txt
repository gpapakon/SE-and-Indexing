<ABSTRACT>
Human serum albumin obtained by gene manipulation 
techniques can be purified by treating recombinant human serum 

albumin with a hydrophobic chromatography carrier at pH of 2 to 
5 and a salt concentration of 0.4 to 1 and exposing the carrier 

to a pH of 6 to 8 and a salt concentration of 0.01 to 0.3 M, or 
treating the culture supernatant with boric acid or a salt 

thereof at pH 8 to 11 for 1 to 10 hours and recovering the 
supernatant to thereby obtain human serum albumin which 

contains substantially no contaminants which are contained in 
the culture medium or contained in or secreted by the host 

microorganism, specifically free nonantigenic contaminants 
detectable by the phenol-sulfuric acid method, antigenic 

producer host-derived contaminants and pyrogen. The thus-obtained 
human serum albumin is of very high purity and free 

from various side effects attributed to the contaminants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to a recombinant human 
serum albumin having novel properties and a process for 
producing said human serum albumin. Albumin, especially human serum albumin (HSA), is an 
important protein of the circulatory system. The protein is 
produced in the liver and has a major role in maintaining 
normal osmotic pressure of body fluids, such as blood. It also 
serves as a carrier of various molecules. HSA is administered under various clinical conditions, 
For example, in the case of shock or burn injury, HSA functions 
to restore blood volume and to alleviate other injury-related 
symptoms. Patients suffering from hypoproteinemia and fetal 
erythroblastosis sometimes require HSA treatment. In other words, a common indication for HSA 
administration is a loss of body fluids, such as during a 
surgical procedure, shock, burn injury or hypoproteinemia which 
causes edema. Currently, HSA is produced mainly as a fractionated 
product of collected blood. Such a production process, 
however, has disadvantages in that it is not economical and the 
supply of blood is sporadic. In addition, collected blood 
sometimes contains undesirable substances, such as hepatitis 
virus. In consequence, it is profitable to develop a material 
which can be used as an HSA substitute.  Recent advances in recombinant DNA techniques have 
rendered possible microbial production of various polypeptides. 
With regard to HSA, establishing techniques for the large scale 
production of HSA by recombinant methods and subsequent high 
grade purification also is in progress. However, in the case of producing HSA by means of gene 
manipulation techniques, it is highly probable that an HSA 
preparation of interest will be contaminated by certain 
components, which are contained in the raw materials or 
secreted by a microorganism during culturing of the host 
microorganism or are introduced during purification of the 
resulting HSA, in the free state or with bound to other 
components. Removal of such contaminants is a unique problem 
for recombinant HSA since the contaminants are not found in 
plasma-derived HSA which has been conventionally used. Thus, 
a new method for purifying recombinant HSA has been desired to 
solve the above problems. An object of the instant invention is to provide human 
serum albumin obtained by means of gene manipulation 
techniques, from which producer host-related substances or 
other contaminants are removed and to provide a process for 
producing the same. Taking the aforementioned
