<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transparent
conductive layered structure having a transparent substrate
and a transparent 2-layer film consisting of a transparent
conductive layer and a transparent coating layer formed in
succession on this substrate, which is used, for instance, as
the front panel for displays, such as Braun tubes (CRTs),
etc., and in particular, relates to a transparent conductive
layered structure wherein the visible light transmittance of
the transparent 2-layer film has been adjusted to a
prescribed range less than 100%, a display in which this
transparent conductive layered structure is used, and a
coating liquid for forming a transparent conductive layer
that is used in the production of transparent conductive
layered structures. As a result of office automation in recent years, many
OA machines have been introduced to offices and an
environment where work must be done all day long facing a
display of an OA machine is not uncommon today.Taking a cathode ray tube (also referred to as the
above-mentioned Braun tube; CRT) of a computer as an example
of an OA machine, it has been required for the use of such
CRTs that, in addition to being able to easily see the
display screen in order to prevent a feeling of visual
fatigue, adhesion of dust and electric shock attributed to
electrification of the CRT screen, etc can be avoided.
Furthermore, there recently has been concerned of the
detrimental effects on the human body from the low-frequency
magnetic waves generated from CRTs and it is desirable that
the CRT not leak such electromagnetic waves to the outside.In addition, the above-mentioned electromagnetic waves
are generated from a deflecting coil or a flyback transformer
and there is a tendency toward leakage of increasingly large
amounts of electromagnetic waves to the surroundings with the
development of larger televisions. Leakage of a magnetic field can be prevented for the
most part by precautions such as changing the shape of the
deflection coil, etc. On the other hand, it is also possible
to prevent leakage of an electric field by forming a
transparent conductive layer on the front glass surface of
the CRT.Such methods of preventing leakage of electric field are
theoretically the same as measures recently taken to prevent
electrification. However, the above-mentioned transparent
conductive layer must have a much higher conductivity than
conductive layers that have been formed for preventing
electrification. That is, although surface resistance of 108
Ω/□ (ohm per square)
