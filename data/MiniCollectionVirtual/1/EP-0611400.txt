A process for degreasing and cleaning metal surfaces 
using surfactant-containing water-based cleaning liquids 

in baths and/or by spray cleaning, optionally followed by 
rinsing of the degreased and cleaned surfaces, characterized 

in that, as a measure of the actual cleaning 
reserve of the cleaning liquid, a value correlated with 

the dynamic surface tension is measured with a bubble 
tensiometer which is operated with sufficiently constant 

gas streams, the results obtained are compared with a 
preset value obtained by calibration for the cleaning 

preparation used and servicing measures for the cleaning 
liquid are carried out in dependence upon the outcome of 

this comparison. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the measurement is carried out on a sample of the 

cleaning liquid cooled to a temperature of 20 to 60Â°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the measurement is carried out on a sample of the 

cleaning liquid diluted with water in a ratio of up to 
1:10. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the measurement is carried out on a sample of the 

cleaning liquid diluted with water in a ratio of 1:0.5 to 
1:2. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the measurement is carried out in 

a sidestream to which water is added at such a temperature 
and
 in such a quantity that the cooling and dilution 
required for the measurement are obtained. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the soiled cleaning liquid is 

regenerated by one of the usual methods, the dynamic 
surface tension of the treated solution is measured, the 

surface-active cleaning components are introduced into  
 

the treated solution in accordance with the result of the 
measurement and the regenerated cleaning liquid obtained 

is reused. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, characterized in 
that membrane filtration is used for regeneration. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that ultrafiltration is carried out as the membrane 

filtration. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that, during the degreasing/cleaning of 

metal surfaces to be electroplated in a following step, 
the dynamic surface tension of the cleaning liquid is 

continuously measured and servicing measures for the 
cleaning liquid are carried out whenever a particular set 

value is exceeded. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that, to prepare fresh cleaning solution, 

the cleaning preparation is dosed in accordance 
with the actual value of the measured dynamic surface 

tension. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that, in a rinse cycle following the 

cleaning/degreasing step, the dynamic surface tension of 
the rinsing water is measured and the rinse cycle is 

terminated when the measured value exceeds a preset 
maximum value. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that, to determine surface tension, the 

maximum pressure difference between the bubbles produced 
with the bubble tensiometer is measured. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that, to determine surface tension, the 

flow rate of the bubbles issuing from the bubble tensiometer 
is measured. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 13,  
 

characterized in that the constant gas streams are 
produced by regulating variable gas streams or by using 

uniformly operating pumps. 
A process as claimed in claim 14, characterized in 
that the gas streams are air streams.
