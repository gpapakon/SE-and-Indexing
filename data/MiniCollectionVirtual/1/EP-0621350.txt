<ABSTRACT>
A metallic article, e.g., a surgical needle 40, 
possesses a multilayer coating exhibiting a brightly colored 

surface of low reflectivity which increases the visibility of 
the articl
e against its background. A physical vapor 
deposition (PVD) procedure, e.g., a cathode sputtering 

technique 10, is used in applying the coating to the metallic 
article.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a metallic article whose 
surface appearance has been altered by the application of a 
series of metal-containing coatings thereto. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a metallic 
article, e.g., a stainless steel surgical needle, possessing a 
multilayer coating exhibiting a brightly colored but 
relatively nonreflective appearance for increased visual 
contrast of the article against its background, and to a 
physical vapor deposition (PVD) process for producing the 
coating. Surgical needles possessing dark nonreflective 
surfaces which increase their visibility are known. U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,905,695, 4,959,068 and 4,968,362 describe such 
needles and chemical methods by which the dark nonreflective 
surfaces can be produced. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) embodies a number of 
related techniques, e.g., cathode sputtering, D.C. sputtering, 
ion plating and arc evaporation deposition, which have been 
used to apply a variety of metal-containing coatings to a 
metal workpiece so as to improve or modify one or more 
characteristics of its surface such as its corrosion 
resistance, hardness, color, etc. German Patent No. 3,841,443 describes a surgical 
needle whose surfaces are coated with a wear resistant metal 
coating employing a PVD technique. The surgical needle to be 
coated is connected to a negative electrical potential of up 
to 600 V. The metal to be applied to the needle is evaporated 
at a cathode under a vacuum of from 10-3 to 10-1 mbar in the 
presence of a suitable gas to form a nitride, carbide or oxide  
 
of the metal on the surface of the needle, e.g., titanium 
nitride or titanium carbide. In accordance with the present invention, a metallic 
article, e.g., a stainless steel surgical needle, is provided 
having a multilayer coating possessing a brightly colored 
surface of low reflectivity, the coating comprising: 
a) a layer of elemental metal; b) a layer of brightly colored metal carbon 
nitride of high reflectivity overlaying the layer of elemental 
metal; and, c) a reflectivity-diminishing layer of metal 
carbide overlaying the second layer of brightly colored metal 
carbon nitride. Further in accordance with the present invention, a 
process is provided for applying a brightly colored coating of 
low reflectivity to a metallic article which comprises: 
a) coating the surface of a metallic article with 
a layer of elemental metal, the formation of the elemental 
metal layer being effected under physical vapor deposition 
conditions in the
