<ABSTRACT>
A self-locking orthodontic bracket having a body with 
an archwire slot (20), and a locking slide member (12) which is 

movable to open and close the slot. Archwire retention is 
provided by the slide member without use of conventional 

ligatures or tie wires. A resilient member (91) is provided to 
retain the slide member in either the open or closed 

position, while preventing excessive sliding movement 
which could disengage the slide member from the bracket 

body.

<DESCRIPTION>
Orthodontic treatment of improperly positioned teeth
involves the application of mechanical forces to urge the
teeth into correct alignment. The most common form of
treatment involves use of orthodontic brackets which are
small slotted bodies configured for direct cemented
attachment to the labial or lingual surfaces of the teeth,
or alternatively for attachment to metal bands which are
in turn cemented or otherwise secured around the teeth.A resilient curved archwire is then seated in the
bracket slots, and the archwire is bent or twisted before
installation whereby the restoring force exerted by the
seated resilient wire tends to shift the teeth into
orthodontically correct alignment. Depending on the shape
of the archwire (both round and rectangular cross sections
are in common use) and the orientation of the bracket
slot, it is possible to apply forces which will shift,
rotate or tip the teeth in any desired direction.Conventional orthodontic brackets include tie wings
around which small ligature Wires are tied to hold the
archwire in a securely seated position in the brackets.
Ligatures or some other form of fastening means are 
essential to insure that the activated archwire is
properly positioned around the dental arch, and to prevent
the wire from being dislodged from the bracket slots
during chewing of food, brushing of the teeth, or
application of other forces to the wire by the patient.Orthodontists are skilled in the manipulation of
ligatures, but the placement of these small wires
nevertheless requires considerable time during initial
installation of an archwire. It is also normally
necessary to remove and replace the ligatures at one or
more intermediate stages of orthodontic treatment
involving sequential use of several different kinds of
archwires, leading to further essentially unproductive
chair time for the orthodontist and possible discomfort
for the patient.Ligatures also tend to make proper oral hygiene more
difficult as the wires can trap food particles, and the
twisted ends of a ligature may be shifted during chewing
into a position where irritation of the patient's gums or
cheek tissue occurs. Broken or dislodged ligatures may
also require emergency patient visits to the orthodontist,
and broken ligatures further present the hazard that a
loose piece of wire may be swallowed or inhaled into the
patient's breathing passages.Many of the problems presented by ligatures are
overcome by self-locking orthodontic brackets which in
many cases eliminate need for these tie wires. One

<CLAIMS>
A self-locking orthodontic bracket assembly, comprising:

a bracket body (11) having a tooth-facing base (13), the body extending forwardly from
the base to define a mesiodistally extending and forwardly open archwire slot (20), the

bracket body defining a forwardly open socket (23) extending toward the base; and

   a slide member (12) engaged with the bracket body (11) to be movable between
an open position in which the archwire slot (20) is open, and a closed position in which

an archwire (52) in the slot is held captive by the member;

   characterised in that said bracket assembly further comprises:

   resilient means (33, 91) seated in the socket (23) and urged at the front side against the
slide member (12) to retain the slide member in the open and closed positions until

substantial force is applied to move the member from one position to the other.
The assembly defined in claim 1 in which the bracket body defines opposed
grooves (27, 28), and the slide member (12) has a body panel (36) with side edges (41)

slidably engaged in the grooves.
The assembly defined in claim 2 in which a channel (4) is formed on an inner
sur
face of the slide member (12), the resilient member (33, 91) extending from the
bracket body (11) to bear against a floor surface of the channel.
The assembly defined in claim 3, wherein the resilient means (91) is a coil
spring.
The assembly defined in claim 3, wherein the resilient means (33) is a resilient
elastomeric plug.
The assembly defined in claim 3 in which the slide-member body panel (36) has
a forwardly extending projection (42) forming a lip (43) to enable application of an

opening force to the member (12). 
The assembly defined in claim 3 in which movement of the slide member (12)
toward the open position is in an occlusal direction.
The assembly defined in claim 3, and in which the bracket body (11) defines an
occlusogingivally extending slot (30) therethrough adjacent the base and rearwardly of

the archwire slot (20) to receive an auxiliary anchorage means.
The assembly defined in claim 3, and in which the bracket body (11) defines a
pair of mesiodistally spaced-apart occlusogingivally extending slots (30) therethrough

adjacent the base and rearwardly of the archwire slot (20) to receive means for auxiliary
anchorages.
