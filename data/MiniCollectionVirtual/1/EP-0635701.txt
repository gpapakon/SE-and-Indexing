<ABSTRACT>
The scanning-signal changes in the measured signals when the scanning distance changes are compensated for by mask-like shutters with the aid of light falling obliquely onto the planes of the divisions of a measuring device (1).

Length or angle measuring device (1) with a 
plurality of grids (3, 10; 4, 11) displaceable relative 

to one another in the measuring direction, and which are 
formed as scanning (8) and as scale grids (2), and which 

modulate the light coming from a light source (6, 65) 
extending parallel to the configuration of the markings 

of the grid markings (3, 10; 4, 11) and obliquely to the 
division planes of the grids (2, 8), the resultant 

modulations in intensity of the light being converted by 
at least one subsequent detector (9, 95) into electrical 

signals offset in phase to one another, and causing 
illumination of the at least one detector (9, 95) 

dependent on the spacing between the grids (2, 8),
 
characterised in that
 
the marking lengths of the grid markings (3, 10; 4, 11) 

of the scanning (8) and scale grid (2) are of such 
dimensions that the areas located in the longitudinal 

direction adjacent to the grid markings (3, 10; 4, 11) 
act as light-impermeable, mask-like barriers for the 

beams of light passing through, so that at the maximum 
accessible spacing (Smax) of the division planes of the 

grids (2, 8) to one another, the at least one detector 
(9, 95) is illuminated to the maximum, while at the 

minimum spacing (Smin) a portion of the beams of light 
passing through is shaded by the mask-like limitations,  

 
so that the detector (9, 95) receives less light and thus 

the higher intensity due to the proximity to the 
illumination is compensated for. 
Length or angle measuring device according to claim 
1, characterised in that the light extending obliquely to 

the division planes and parallel to the grid markings (3, 
10; 4, 11) is aligned by means of a cylinder lens (75) 

which is arranged in the focal point of a light source 
(65). 
Length or angle measuring device according to claim 
1, characterised in that the light source (6) is 

displaced in the focal plane of a condenser (7) in the 
direction of the markings to the optical axis in such a 

way that a parallel beam path results, which is inclined 
in the direction of the markings to the optical axis at 

an angle (α). 
Length or angle measuring device according to claim 
1, characterised in that an illuminating unit comprising 

light source (6) and condenser (7) is located at an 
inclination to the optical axis in such a way that a 

parallel beam path results, which is inclined in the 
direction of the markings to the optical axis at an angle 

(α).  
 
Length of angle measuring device according to claim 
1, characterised in that the device operates on the 

transmitted-light principle.
