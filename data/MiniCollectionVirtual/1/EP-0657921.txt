<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
semiconductor devices and methods of producing the
same, and more particularly to a semiconductor device
which encapsulates a semiconductor element by a resin
and to a method of producing such a semiconductor
device.Recently, there are demands to further reduce
the size of electronic equipments such as personal
computers, and as a result, there are increased demands
to realize smaller semiconductor devices which are used
in such electronic equipments.In semiconductor devices, a substrate which
holds a semiconductor element or the volume of an
encapsulating resin is large compared to the size of
the semiconductor element. For this reason, in order
to reduce the size of the semiconductor device, it is
necessary to appropriately reduce the size of the
substrate or the encapsulating resin.On the other hand, when the size of the
semiconductor device is reduced, the heat radiation
characteristic of the semiconductor device
deteriorates. As a result, it is necessary to provide
an efficient heat radiation means.Therefore, there are demands to realize a
semiconductor device which has a reduced size but can
be formed with ease and has a satisfactory heat
radiation characteristic.A description will be given of an example of
a conventional semiconductor device and a method of
producing the same, by referring to FIGS.1A through 1C.
FIGS.1A through 1C respectively show cross sections of
the conventional semiconductor device at various stages 
of the production process.As shown in FIG.1C, a conventional
semiconductor device 60 includes a semiconductor
element 1, a mold resin 3, a lead frame 46 and the
like. The semiconductor element 1 is die-bonded on a
die-pad portion 39 which is formed on the lead frame
46. In addition, wires 10 are provided between
electrode pad portions 40 on the top surface of the
semiconductor element 1 and inner lead portions of the
lead frame 46. The electrode pad portions 40 are shown
in FIG.1A. The mold resin 3 encapsulates the
semiconductor element 1, the wires 10 and the inner
lead portions of the lead frame 46, so as to protect
the semiconductor element 1 and the wires 10.The mold resin 3 is formed as shown in
FIG.1B. In FIG.1B, an upper mold 20a and a lower mold
20b form a transfer mold. When the lead frame 46
mounted with the semiconductor element 1 and having the
wires 10 bonded thereto as shown in FIG.1A is loaded
between the upper and lower molds 20a and 20b.A plunger 22 arranged on the upper mold 20a
