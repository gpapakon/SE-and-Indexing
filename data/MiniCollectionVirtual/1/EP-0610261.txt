<ABSTRACT>
A leadfree plate-shaped roof flashing material comprises a sandwich structure in which a stress damping and stabilizing layer (1) of ductile material is completely covered on one side and at least partly covered on the other side by preferably metallic foil sheetings (2, 3), e.g. of aluminium foil, designed with densely positioned flattened folded sections (4) having such a form, e.g. as closed inverted pleats, that the extreme material layer (4a) of each folded section gets into contact with the stress damping and stabilizing layer (1) only when the folded sections open in connection with deforming the flashing material to make it fit to the roofing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a leadfree plate-shaped 
roof flashing material having a sandwich structure 
including a preferably metallic foil and a stress 
damping and stabilizing layer of ductile material. Such flashing materials in the form of plate 
members or skirts are used in the manufacturing of 
sealed joints between the main frame of a window 
installed in an inclined roof and the surrounding 
roofing, in particular as a skirt-shaped flashing at 
the lower horizontal member of the main frame. Such materials have traditionally been constituted 
by lead plates of a thickness of appr. 1 mm, whose 
deformability to follow the shape of the roofing has 
frequently required hammering, thereby involving the 
risk of cracks and breakages. From Danish Patent Specifications Nos 148 064 
and 145 509 and DE-A-4 032 058 
designs of flashing materials are known in which said 
drawback has been remedied, so that the flashing 
material is much deformable by manual processing either 
by wave corrugation of the material or by designing it 
with parallel flattened, spaced apart folded sections 
and for instance with wave corrugation of the material 
between the folded sections. In order to avoid the economical and environmental 
problems involved by the traditional use of lead 
in flashing materials, the above referenced Danish 
Patent Specifications suggest leadfree sandwich structures 
consisting of thin metal foil, preferably aluminium 
foil and a pressure adhesive coating, e.g. of 
bitumen. This sandwich structure is manufactured in a 
flat condition, following which the structure is corrugated 
in an omega-like waveform, the cross-sectional 
dimension of each curve being larger than the width of 
the slit aperture of the curve.  
 As regards roofings in the form of undulated 
tiles with very deep troughs it has turned out to be 
difficult, even with these wave-corrugated designs, to 
obtain a sufficiently manual deformability to enable 
snap-fit interlocking between the flashing and roofing, 
and irrespective of the intended purely manual deformability 
it has frequently been necessary to undertake 
processing with a press tool or a hammer tool. As a consequence, the suggested leadfree flashing 
materials have had difficulty in gaining a footing 
in the market as a competitive and equal alternative of 
lead flashings and this has instead resulted in efforts 
to improve such flashings through wavepleated or folded 
designs, in which the lead thickness has been reduced, 
and attempts have been made to provide a

stress damping and stabilizing layer (1) is completely 

covered on one side and at least partly covered on the 
other side by a foil sheeting (2, 3) formed with flattened
