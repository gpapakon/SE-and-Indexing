<ABSTRACT>
A device is described for handling baked goods (51, 52, 53), which are ball-shaped in particular, which has a table (14) which is coupled to a conveying device (16) and has a charging surface (34) for baked items, the said handling device also having a channel (50) which is adapted to the outer diameter of a baked item and is connected to the table (14), it being possible for an injection pipe (88) to be arranged alongside the channel (50) so as to be displaceable in its longitudinal direction and transversely to the channel (50), the said injection pipe (88) being coupled to a metering and injection device. This means that fully baked items, such as ball-shaped doughnuts, can be filled with jam or similar pasty substances.
