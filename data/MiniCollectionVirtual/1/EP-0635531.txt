<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to absorbable liquid
copolymers of ε-caprolactone and lactide. More
specifically, it relates to liquid copolymers of
caprolactone and lactide suitable for use in biomedical
applications such as drug delivery, coatings for surgical
sutures and needles and lubricants for medical devices.Pharmaceuticals have been conventionally administered,
either in oral or parenteral dosage forms. However, these
dosage forms are not always well suited for particular
drugs or prolonged drug therapies. Many pharmaceuticals
cannot be administered orally and patient noncompliance
with dosage instructions is also a significant problem
with oral dosage forms. To overcome these and other short
comings of these dosage forms several new dosage forms
have recently been developed.The most notable recent development has been the use of
bioerodible or bioabsorbable polymer matrices as carriers
for implantable or intrauterine devices. Several
publications describe these materials such as U.S. Patent
4,304,767 to Heller et al., "Biodegradable block
copolymer matrices for long-acting contraceptives with
constant release" J. Contr. Rel. 32 (1992) 3-14 by Z.W. Gu 
et al., and U.S. Patent 5,030,457 to Ng.Heller describes a family bioabsorbable poly(ortho esters)
which may be used as a matrix for controlled drug release.
The polymers Heller et al. describes are synthesized by
reacting a polyol with a diketene acetal. The polymers
produced by this synthesis tend to be rigid because of the
pentaerythritol segments in the polymer backbone.
Unfortunately, this limits the use of these polymers to
solid implants which generally must be surgically
implanted.Similarly, Gu et al. describes hard microspheres triblock
copolymer of poly(e-caprolactone-co-DL-lactide-co-glycolide)
for the controlled release of contraceptives.
The microspheres that Gu et al., describes are designed to
be injected thereby avoiding the need to surgically
implant a solid dosage. Unfortunately, these copolymers
must be formed into microspheres and the kinetics of the
pharmaceutical release are complicated by the different
release mechanisms of the individual blocks of the
triblock copolymer.Ng describes a bioerodible polymer poly(ortho ester)
formed from a one step reaction of a ortho ester and a
triol. These polymer are more flexible than the polymers
described by Heller and can be employed in ointments, gels
and creams. Unfortunately the poly(ortho esters)
described by Ng are highly susceptible to acid hydrolysis
which limits their utility as a
