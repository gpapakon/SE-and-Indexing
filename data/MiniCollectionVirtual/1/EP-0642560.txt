<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions that include at least one
fluoroether and at least one hydrofluorocarbon. Such compositions may be used as
refrigerants, cleaning agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and polyurethanes,
aerosol propellants, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing
agents, power cycle working fluids, polymerization media, particulate removal fluids,
carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, displacement drying agents and as carriers for
sterilant gases.Included in this invention are compositions which include a
fluoroether and a hydrofluorocarbon in which the halocarbon global warming
potential (HGWP) of the hydrofluorocarbon is lowered by adding the fluoroether to
the hydrofluorocarbon. Also included in this invention are compositions a
fluoroether and a hydrofluorocarbon that are azeotropic or azeotrope-like.Fluorinated hydrocarbons have many uses, one of which is as a
refrigerant. Such refrigerants include dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12) and
chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22).In recent years it has been suggested that certain chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerants released into the
atmosphere may adversely affect the ozone layer. Although this proposition has not
yet been completely established, there is a movement toward the control of the use
and the production of certain CFCs and HCFCs under an international agreement.In order to address the potential problem of ozone depletion, it has
been suggested that chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants and hydrochlorofluorocarbon
refrigerants be replaced with hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants. Since the
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants contain no chlorine, they have zero ozone
depletion potential.Another environmental concern is the role of CFCs in the
"greenhouse effect". The greenhouse effect refers to the warming of the Earth's
climate that takes place when atmospheric gases, which are relatively transparent to
visible light and allow sunshine to reach the Earth, trap heat by absorbing infrared
radiation released by the Earth. There is presently no universally accepted methodology for combining
all relevant factors into a singe global warming potential for emissions of gases such
as CFCS. One approach is to define the greenhouse effect of a compound in terms
of a potential to enhance global warming relative to a known standard. One such
definition is known as a halocarbon global warming potential (HGWP), which is the
ratio of incremental radiative warming resulting from an emission of
