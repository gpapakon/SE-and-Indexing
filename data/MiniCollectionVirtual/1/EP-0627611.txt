<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for checking the conformity of hybridisation balls (9) presented on a chip or a substrate (1) and to the device for implementing it. The method consists of the following steps:   a) positioning (210) the chip or substrate hybridisation balls against a plate which is transparent at a wavelength  lambda ; b) partially compressing (220) the said hybridisation balls on the transparent plate, this compression creating flattened areas of balls on the plate; c) illuminating the balls by means of a light beam of wavelength lambda through the transparent plate; d) acquisition (320-330) of the signal reflected by the hybridisation balls to be tested; e) determining (340) the respective conformity or non-conformity of the hybridisation balls to be tested as a function of the signal reflected by each of them.   Application in microelectronics.

Process for checking the conformity of the hybridization 
balls (9) present on one face of an electronic component or 

a substrate (1), characterized in that it consists of the following 
stages: 


a) positioning (210) the hybridization balls of the electronic 
component or substrate against a strip transparent to the wavelength 

λ, 
b) partial flattening (220) of said hybridization balls on 
the transparent strip, said flattening creating ball flats 

on the strip, 
c) illuminating the balls with a light beam of wavelength 
λ through the transparent strip, 
d) acquisition (320-330) of the signal reflected by the hybridization 
balls to be checked, 
e) determination (340) of the conformity or non-conformity 
of the hybridization balls to be checked as a function of the 

signal reflected by each of them. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
stage c) consists of illuminating the assembly of the electronic 

component or substrate by the light beam and stage d) consists 
of acquiring the signal reflected by said assembly. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that stage 
c) consists of illuminating part of the electronic component 

or substrate by the light beam, said part being liable to have 
at least one ball and stage d) consists of acquiring the

repeated so as to check the assembly of the electronic component 
or substrate. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the stage b) of flattening the hybridization balls 

against the transparent strip consists of positioning the electronic 
component or substrate at a previously defined distance from the 

transparent strip, said distance corresponding to a theoretical 
reference ball height, less the acceptable deviation between said 

theoretical ball height and a minimum height of the hybridization 
balls to be checked in order to ensure that said balls are in 

conformity. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized

consists of detecting, from the acquired reflected signal, the 
presence or absence of a flat linked with a ball respectively at 

the different locations liable to be occupied by balls. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the stage e) of determining the conformity of the balls 

consists of detecting, from the acquired reflected signal, at the 
different locations liable to be occupied by the balls, the presence 

or absence of a flat and measuring in the case of the detection of 
a flat the size of the latter.
