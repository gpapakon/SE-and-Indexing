<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides novel peptides and vaccines containing them capable of inducing production of antibodies directed against Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (CPa) in animals to which they are administered and thereby providing prophylaxis against infection by Clostridium perfringens and/or the alpha-toxin itself. Particularly the present invention provides such a vaccine that is relatively safe and simple to produce, e.g. by genetic engineering means. Preferred peptides comprise theo amino acid sequence of Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin from amino acid 247 to 370 but lack the epitopes necessary for phospholipase C and/or sphingomyelin hydrolysing activity found between amino acids 1 to 240 of that sequence. Further provided are antisera and antibodies raised to the peptides and vaccines of the present invention, and particularly monoclonal antibodies and hybridoma cell lines for their production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel peptides capable of illiciting an
immunological response that is protective against Clostridium perfringens
in man or animals; more particularly to novel peptides capable of
illiciting such protective response against the alpha-toxin of that
organism. Preferred agents
enable prophylaxis and treatment of Clostridium perfringens induced
disease states in both humans and other animals.Clostridium perfringens(C. perfringens) is ubiquitous in the
environment and has been found in the soil, decaying organic matter and
as part of the gut flora in man and animals. Different strains of C.
perfringens can be assigned to one of five biotypes (A-E) depending on
the spectrum of toxins produced (McDonel (1986) Pharmacology of Bacterial
Toxins; F Dorner and J Drews (Editors) Pergamon Press, Oxford). Biotype
A strains are of particular importance as the etiological agents of gas
gangrene in man. The disease is of increasing significance in the
elderly and in diabetic populations, especially in those who have
undergone lower limb surgery, where impaired blood supply to tissues can
lead to anoxic conditions suitable for multiplication of the bacterium.
The disease can also arise in patients who have undergone surgery of the
gastrointestinal tract when contamination of damaged tissues with gut
contents can result in its establishment. A more periodic increase in
the incidence of gas gangrene has been shown to occur during armed
conflicts when deep tissue wounds are contaminated with soil and the
failure to promptly treat such injuries resulted in the death of several
hundred thousand combatants during World War I.The pathogenesis of gas gangrene can be largely attributed to the
production of potent exotoxins by the bacterium, of which the alpha-toxin
has received attention as the major contributor to the disease. The
toxin may act peripherally to the initial focus of infection by damaging
and reducing the blood supply to tissues thus promoting the conditions
required for spread of the infection. In the later stages of the disease the toxin may act sytemically causing
death. A crude C.perfringens toxoid vaccine was demonstrated to provide
protection against experimentally induced gas gangrene as long ago as
1937 ( Penfold and Tolhurst (1937) Medical Journal of Australia, pp 604)
) and subsequent studies suggested that the effective component of this
vaccine was derived from the alpha-toxin ( Robertson and Keppie (1943).
