Illumination apparatus for a microlithographic projection
exposure system for the selective provision of various

illumination modes namely voluntarily many modes including
conventional illumination with definable coherence factor

(σ), ring aperture illumination and symmetrical off-axis
illumination from two or four directions


with a light source (1),
with means (21-24) for the separate reception of
light fluxes from two or four spatial angle regions

of the light flux which is emitted by the light
source (1),
with means (31-34) for forming or limiting the
received light fluxes,
with a mirror arrangement (511-514, 521-524, 531,
533; 6) for imaging the light fluxes onto sectors of

a pupil plane (93), which is the fourier transform of
the reticle plane for the reticle (10) to be imaged,
with displacing means (541-544) for each separate
light flux such that the images of the light fluxes

can be voluntarily shifted radially and azimuthally
in the pupil plane (93).
Illumination apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that the means (21-24) for reception or the means (31-34)

for forming or limiting the received light fluxes
contain light guides (31-34).
Illumination apparatus according to claim 2, characterized
in that the displacing means (541-544) displace the

positions of the exits of the light guides (31-34).
Illumination apparatus according to claim 1, characterized
in that the displacing means (541-544) displace parts of

the mirror arrangement (511-533). 
Illumination apparatus according to at least one of the
claims 1-4, characterized in that a glass rod (7) is

arranged between the mirror arrangement (511-533; 6) and
the reticle plane (10).
Illumination apparatus according to claim 5, characterized
in that a variable mask system (8) is arranged near the

exit end (72) of the glass rod (7).
Illumination apparatus according to at least one of the
claims 1-6, characterized in that the images of the light

fluxes in the pupil plane (93) are dimensioned such that
they are suitable for the symmetric off-axis illumination

or for the conventional illumination with a coherence
factor of σ = 0,1 or more without of a scanning movement.
Illumination apparatus according to at least one of the
claims 1-7, characterized in that means are provided for

changing the magnitude of the images of the light fluxes
in the pupil plane.
Illumination apparatus according to at least one of the
claims 1-8, characterized in that means for changing the

shape of the light fluxes are provided.
Illumination apparatus according to at least one of the
claims 1-9, characterized in that the light fluxes are

transformed into ring segment shape.
Illumination apparatus according to at least one of the
claims 1-10, characterized in that the light source is a

laser and the means for separate reception of light fluxes
contain a beam splitter.
Illumination apparatus according to at least one of the
claims 1-11, characterized in that for producing a certain

mode of illumination the displacing means (541-544) exert
a scanning movement during each process of exposure, so 

a scanning movement during each process of exposure, so
that an image of the light fluxes is produced sequentially

in the pupil plane.
