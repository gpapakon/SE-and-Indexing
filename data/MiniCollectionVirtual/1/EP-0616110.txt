<ABSTRACT>
The vanes (blades) (3) are set into a ring (hoop) (5) and are extended beyond by a base portion (8) ending in a shoe (9) which rubs on an outer shell ring. The rubbing very effectively damps out the vibrations of the vanes. Application especially to the stationary vanes for straightening out the flow of gases in turbomachines such as compressors.

A stage of blades (3) embedded in a ring (5) by way 
of a root part (8) and free at an end (7) remote therefrom, 

the root part extending beyond the ring, characterised in that 
the root part terminates in a shoe (9) rubbing on a surface of 

a shroud (10) concentric with the ring (5).

characterised in that the shoes (9) or the surfaces of the 

shroud (10) have a low-friction covering. 
A stage of blades according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a damping material fills the gap (12) 

between the ring and the shroud surfaces. 
A stage of blades according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the shoes (9) have overlap zones (11) 

rubbing on adjacent shoes. 
A stage of blades according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the shoes (9A, 9B) have a rubbing 

surface notched wth grooves (14, 15). 
A stage of blades according to any of claims 1 to 5,
