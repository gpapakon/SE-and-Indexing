<ABSTRACT>
The profiling (3) on the two opposite mould sides (2) run perpendicularly to the direction of the up and down movement of the press plunger. These two sides are movable from a closed position into an open position by a pivoting motion in a defined plane. Both of the profiles of the mould walls may go in a vertical direction towards and away from the stamper and in a level plane with the mould walls.
