<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns partial genetic nucleotides 
of hepatitis C virus (hereinafter "HCV"), specific primers and 
probes, and method of determining HCV genotypes and method of 
detecting HCV in samples utilizing such primers and probes. After the presentation of the partial sequence of genomic 
nucleotides of HCV in 1988 by the researchers of Chiron Corp., 
diagnostic systems were developed to detect HCV antibodies using 
recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides based on the nucleotide 
sequences. These techniques are today put to practical use in the 
screening of bloods for transfusion and in the diagnosis of 
patients. The antibody test, however, can not completely detect HCV 
carriers. In addition, it is not sensitive enough to judge the 
patients' condition in either acute or chronic hepatitis, for 
establishment of guidance of treatment, and for judging the effect 
of treatment. As a result, besides the antibody test, diagnostic methods 
to detect HCV carriers were researched and developed in order to 
detect HCV genes with high specificity and good sensitivity. 
Because of the high variability of HCV, these detection systems were 
developed with the intention to detect conservative regions of HCV 
genes by comparing those sequences of HCV strains available to the 
public today. Though those detection methods using nucleotides 
really provide more useful information than methods using 
antibodies, there are still some cases of HCV carriers reported  
 
where there was no detection of HCV gene, thus indicating that the 
detection systems still do not have satisfactory performance. Accordingly, there is desired the establishment of an 
improved method to detect HCV genes which covers more HCV strains. An object of the present invention is to reveal new 
nucleotide sequences of the 5' noncoding region and the following 
structural protein coding region of HCV which have not been 
previously discovered, to obtain oligonucleotides of a part of the 
new sequences, to provide a method to detect HCV with high 
specificity and good sensitivity using the oligonucleotides as a 
primer or a probe in order to detect extensively HCV genes of more 
varied strains, and to provide a method to determine the HCV 
genotype using the oligonucleotides as a primer or a probe. The oligonucleotides, primers and probes, and methods of 
the present invention can be utilized in screening of bloods; 
determining differences in response to treatments by types I-VI of 
HCV; and in epidemiology in tracing the source
