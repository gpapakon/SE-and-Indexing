<ABSTRACT>
A detector system for direct internal dosimetry in a person has at least three detectors for detecting gamma-quanta and holding means for the detectors. The object of the invention is to design a detector system which allows the actual dose equivalent in an examined person to be directly measured. For that purpose, three detectors are used, of which one is applied to the lungs, one to the digestive tract and one to the leg area of the person to be examined.

<CLAIMS>
Detector system for the direct internal dosimetry 
in a person, having at least three detectors for detecting 

gamma quanta and means for holding the detectors, wherein a 
first detector (1) is provided, the central axis (la) of 

which points towards the centre of mass of the lungs of the 
person, a second detector (2) is provided, the central axis 

(2a) of which points to the centre of mass of the digestive 
tract of the person, and a third detector (3) is provided, 

the central axis (3a) of which points towards the leg area 
of the person, and wherein the detectors (1, 2, 3) are 

surrounded by protective lead screens (6, 7, 8), which are 
open towards the body of the person, characterised in that 

the second detector (2) is mounted in a stool-like housing 
(12) in such a manner that the non-screened area of the 

detector (2) points upwardly. 
Detector system according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the non-screened area of the first detector (1) 

lies opposite the chest of the person when sitting in an 
upright position, the central axis (2a) extending 

horizontally. 
Detector system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the non-screened area of the third 

detector (3) lies opposite the tibias of the person when 
sitting in an upright position, the angle between the 

central axis (3a) and the vertical having a value of 
between 0° and 30°. 
Detector system according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised by an additional detector (4), the central 

axis (4a) of which points towards the thyroid gland of the 
person.  

 
Detector system according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the housing (12) is configured to be 

horizontally and vertically displaceable.
