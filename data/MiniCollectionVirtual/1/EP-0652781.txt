<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mass transfer device in which substances contained in fluids flowing on opposite sides of microporous hollow fiber membranes are exchanged for each other by molecular transfer across the membranes. More particularly, the invention relates to a hollow fiber blood oxygenator for extracorporeally oxygenating the blood of an animal or human.Many types of hollow-fiber blood oxygenators have been or are presently available. These are illustrated by:
1. longitudinal (axial) flow through an annular bundle-see U.S. Patent No. 4,975,247;2. circumferential flow around an annular bundle--see U.S. Patent No. 3,794,468;3. transverse flow across a bundle of substantially rectangular cross section--see U.S. Patent No. 5,188,801; and4. radially outward flow through an annular bundle--see U.S. Patent No. 3,422,008.Methods for manufacturing the annular shaped hollow fiber bundles are also available. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,422,008 and 4,975,247 show a method for spiral winding of ribbons of fibers in a criss-cross pattern. The latter patent shows the formation of regional mats and interleaving of the ribbons at the boundary of such regional mats. The above patents disclose the mounting of a core on a rotating mounting member, where the fiber guide traverses reciprocally along a line parallel to the rotational (longitudinal) axis of the mounting member. The above patents further disclose winding fiber onto the core at constant revolutions per minute (RPM) of the mounting membrane and constant traverse speed of the guide. As the bundle increases in size, i.e. as the circumference of the bundle upon which the fiber is wound increases, the packing fraction of the fiber decreases. In other words, as the bundle extends radially outward relative to the axis of the core, the packing fraction decreases.For the purposes of this application, packing fraction is defined to mean the fraction of a unit volume of bundle space occupied by hollow fiber. The packing fraction may be determined in ways known in the art including the convenient method of measuring the interstitial space between fiber by weight gain when a unit volume of bundle is primed with a known liquid. Packing fraction at a particular region or zone located radially outward may be determined by stopping the winding process at the radially inner radial boundary of the region or zone and determining the packing fraction at that stage and then continuing the winding process to the outer radial boundary of the region or zone and determining the
