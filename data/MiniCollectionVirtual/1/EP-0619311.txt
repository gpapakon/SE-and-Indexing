<ABSTRACT>
Process for obtaining benzoxazines useful for the synthesis of ofloxacin, levofloxacin and derivatives thereof. The benzoxazines 
(I) wherein Xb is halogen and R₁ is H, alkyl or alkylene up to 6 C atoms or aryl, may be obtained by cyclazation of a 

compound having the formula (II) by reaction with triphenylphosphin and azodicarboxylate of ethyl. The compounds of 
formula (II) may be obtained by reaction of a compound (III) with an appropriate epoxy. By using the appropriate chiral 

epoxy, the enantiomerically desired intermediate may be obtained, and consequently it is possible to selectively obtain the 
desired f
inal product with the appropriate enantiomer form without having to go through a resolution step. The compounds 
(I) are valuable and key intermediates for the synthesis of antimicrobial agents such as floxacin and levofloxacin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention describes a new process for the synthesis 
of benzoxazine derivatives of general formula (I) 
where: 
R₁is H, an alkyl radical of up to 6 carbon atoms, 
preferably methyl, an alkenyl radical of up to 6 
carbon atoms or an aryl group; and Xbis an halogen atom.  These compounds of formula (I) are advanced and key 
intermediates for the commercial synthesis of antibacterial 
compounds such as the Ofloxazine (racemate) and its 
enantiomerically pure forms, among them the levofloxacine. The formula of the Ofloxacine [9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3 
dihydro-7H-pyrid(1,2,3-de) 
(1,4)-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid] is:  It is described in Patents: Japanese no. 1,444,043; U.S. 
no. 4,382,892 and European no. EP-B-0,047,005. The 
Ofloxazine is an excellent synthetical antimicrobial 
agent as mentioned in the application for Japanese Patent 
no. 46986/92 (OPI) which has been marketed in many 
countries. The Ofloxazine has an asymmetric carbon atom in position 
3 and is normally obtained as racemate through processes 
already known. However, through the process of this 
invention, it is possible to directly obtain any of its 
optically active forms without the need to carry out any 
resolution stage. The researches made by the authors of this invention have 
shown that the 3-(S)- isomer of the Ofloxazine, known as 
Levofloxazine, has (1) an antimicrobial activity twice 
higher than that of the racemic thus confirming the 
statements of European patent no. EP-A-0,206,283 and (ii) 
an acute toxicity (LD₅₀) weaker than that of the racemic 
compound which has been determined in mice through 
intravenous administration. Furthermore, it has been 
possible to assess that the isomer (R) presents (i) an 
antimicrobial activity between ten and one hundred times 
lower than that of the racemic compound and (ii) it has 
an acute toxicity basically similar to that of such 
racemic one. Consequently, the (S) form of Ofloxazine  
 
(Levofloxazine) presents very interesting properties, 
such as an increased antimicrobial activity and a reduced 
toxicity. Therefore it can be assumed that this compound 
will be - from a pharmaceutical point of view - more 
useful than the racemic one. Indeed, it has been possible to determine that the water 
solubility of both the (R)-Ofloxazine form and the (S)-Ofloxazine 
form in free form is higher than that of the 
(R,S) compound and, therefore, it can be used for 
injectable preparations. The description of the Ofloxazine and of the Levofloxazine 
as well
