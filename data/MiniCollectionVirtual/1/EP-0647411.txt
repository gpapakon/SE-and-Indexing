<ABSTRACT>
Tobacco product for producing home-made cigarettes, in particular using prefabricated cigarette-paper tubes, comprising one or more tobacco portion(s) which comprises/comprise in each case at least two fractions (11) and is/are held together by inner and/or outer fixing means, each fraction (11) containing approximately the quantity of tobacco which is necessary for one cigarette, and the outer surface of the tobacco portion and/or the fractions (11) being permeable with respect to air such that it/they cannot be drawn on as such and thus cannot be smoked. The tobacco portion is in the form of a tobacco block (10), such that each fraction (11) forms a tobacco rod with an approximately triangular or polygonal, in particular rectangular, preferably square cross-section, and a length which corresponds to the length of the tobacco-receiving area of the cigarette which is to be produced.

Smoking tobacco for producing own-rolled cigarettes, in
particular using pre-manufactured cigarette paper sleeves,

comprising one or more tobacco portion(s) which each comprise
at least two sub-portions (11) and are held together by inner

and/or outer fixing agents, each sub-portion (11) containing
approximately the quantity of tobacco required for one

cigarette, and the lateral surface of the tobacco portion
and/or the sub-portions (11) being air-permeable so that, at

such, it/they cannot be drawn on and therefore smoked,

characterised in that
 the tobacco portion is fashioned in the
form of a tobacco cuboid (10), such that each sub-portion (11)

forms a tobacco stick having an approximately triangular or
polygonal, in particular a rectangular, preferably square,

cross-section, and a length corresponding to the length of the
tobacco receiving space of the cigarette to be produced, the

tobacco cuboid being pre-portioned into stick-like sub-portions
(11) which either lie loosely against one another, so

that they may be separated without aids, or are held together
by narrow tobacco webs.
Smoking tobacco according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the tobacco is pressed such that it has a draw resistance
and filling density corresponding approximately to that of the

tobacco filling of a conventional cigarette.
Smoking tobacco according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 the tobacco is pressed and possibly treated with inner
fixing agents, such as conventional cigarette sauces or the

like, such that, after being separated, the sub-portions (11)
hold together, still maintaining their specified shape. 
Smoking tobacco according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the tobacco cuboid (10) is sub-divided
into sub-portions (11) by cutting (12), punching, or grooving

or similar mechanical separation.
Smoking tobacco according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 separating webs (17 and 18) of tin-foil
paper, paperboard or a similar relatively rigid material,

which may not be consumed by smoking, extend into the
separating plane between two sub-portions (11) of a tobacco

cuboid (10).
Smoking tobacco according to Claim 5, 
characterised in
that
 the separating webs (17 and 18) are part of an outer
wrapping (19 and 20 and 21), in particular part of a wrapping

(19 and 20) extending only over one large face and possibly
also the two opposing longitudinal and/or narrow end faces of

the tobacco cuboid (10).
Smoking tobacco according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the tobacco cuboid (10) is surrounded in
tube-like manner by a wrapping (15), the mutually overlapping

faces of the wrapping (15) being placed loosely over one
another.
Smoking tobacco according to Claim 7, 
characterised in
that
 the tubular wrapping (15) is made of a material which may
not be consumed by smoking, in particular aluminium-coated

paper.
Smoking tobacco according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the stick-like sub-portions (11) are each held together
by a rod cover either of a material which may be consumed by

smoking or a material which may not be consumed by smoking, 
such as aluminium-coated paper or the like, in which latter

case the mutually overlapping longitudinal edges of the rod
cover or wrapping are placed loosely over one another.
Smoking tobacco according to one of Claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 the tobacco cuboid (10) is bordered by a
strip of material which may not be consumed by smoking, for

example paperboard, plastics material or the like, extending
over the longitudinal and narrow end faces.
Smoking tobacco according to one of Claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that
 a plurality of tobacco cuboids (10) of
the said type are stacked one above another to form a

relatively large unit (16).
Smoking tobacco according to one of Claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that
 packing is associated with the tobacco
cuboid (10), said packing comprising the use of a packing

material, in particular paperboard or the like, which extends
in tube-like manner around the tobacco cuboid (10), the

mutually overlapping longitudinal faces being joined together
by adhesion.
Smoking tobacco according to Claim 12, 
characterised in
that
 the packing extends around the two large faces and the
two narrow longitudinal faces of the tobacco cuboid (10).
Smoking tobacco according to Claim 12, 
characterised in
that
 the packing extends around the two large faces and the
two narrow end faces of the tobacco cuboid (10).
Smoking tobacco according to one of Claims 12 to 14,

characterised in that
, around each face of the tobacco cuboid
(10), a further packing envelope serving as an aroma and 

moisture barrier is placed around the packing.
A process for producing a tobacco cuboid according to one
of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 a tobacco rod (22)
having an approximately rectangular cross-section is guided

continuously or intermittently past a tobacco separating
device (24) (arrow 25), which comprises a plurality of cutting

or punching elements (revolving blade 23) arranged mutually
adjacent at a spacing and by means of which the tobacco rod

(22) is sub-divided into individual part rods which are
preferably still mutually connected at the face remote from

the cutting elements, and 
in that
 the part rods are then cut
to sub-portion length by a blade or similar cutting device

acting transversely with respect to the conveying direction
(25) of the tobacco rod (22).
A process according to Claim 16, 
characterised in that

the cutting or punching elements (revolving blade 23) act on
the upper (Fig. 10), lower (Fig. 9) or both large faces of the

tobacco rod (22).
A process according to Claim 16 or 17, 
characterised in
that
 separating webs (17 and 18) of paperboard or the like are
inserted into the
 separating cuts between adjacent part rods,
which separating webs are either already cut to sub-portion

length or are cut to sub-portion length together with the part
rods.
A process for producing own-rolled cigarettes, in
particular filter cigarettes, using smoking tobacco according

to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 a sub-portion
(11) of the tobacco cuboid (10) is separated off, then is

characterised in
that
 the packed tobacco cuboids (10) are placed, each with one
end face of their packing open, over the upper filling opening

of the pressing chamber of a conventional filing device, so
that the packing serves as a type of hopper or re-fill shaft

for feeding sub-portions into the pressing chamber, these
merely being pushed down successively or in sub-portions from

above after each particular use until all sub-portions in a
pack have been used.
