<ABSTRACT>
Carboxymethyl cellulose fibre having a degree of substitution of at least 0.1, preferably 0.2-0.5, carboxymethyl group per glucose unit, is derived from solvent-spun cellulose fibre, for example by reaction with a strong alkali and a monochloroacetate reagent. The fibre has an absorbency of at least 8 grams, usually at least 15 grams, 0.9 % saline solution per gram of fibre and a tenacity of at least 10, usually at least 15, cN/Tex. It can be used for absorbent personal products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cellulosic fibres having high
absorbency for aqueous fluids. Such fibres are used in
absorbent personal products, such as disposable diapers,
tampons, sanitary napkins and incontinence pads, and in
absorbent wipes, and may also be used as part of the fibre
content in moisture-absorbing clothing or in towels. The
absorbency of cellulosic fibres can be increased by
incorporating highly absorbent chemicals in the fibres or by
chemical modification of the cellulose itself. The
incorporation of highly absorbent chemicals has the risk
that the chemicals may be released from the fibres. The
present invention is concerned with chemically modified
cellulosic fibres, in particular carboxymethylated cellulose
fibres.Carboxymethyl cellulose in powder form is well known
commercially as a thickener. It is produced by reaction of
cellulose pulp with a strong alkali such as sodium hydroxide
and monochloroacetic acid or a salt thereof. There have been
several suggestions for the production of carboxymethyl
cellulose fibres but these have not been widely used
commercially. Documents describing the production of
carboxymethyl cellulose fibres are GB-A-2220881, GB-A-2094802,
US-A-3731686, US-A-1736714, JP-A-49-55993, JP-A-56-15458,
JP-A-3-825 and JP-A-3-269144, and articles in J.
Applied Polymer Science, volume 17 (1973) at pages 3375-3388
and Textile Research J., 1971, pages 680-685. The references
describe the production of carboxymethyl cellulose fibres
from regenerated cellulose (viscose rayon) fibres or from
cotton. There are problems in achieving highly absorbent
fibres which are free of surface stickiness and which are
strong enough to be processed on textile machinery. We have found according to the invention that
carboxymethyl cellulose fibre of greater absorbency and
strength free from surface stickiness can be produced from
solvent-spun cellulose fibre.Carboxymethyl cellulose fibre according to the
invention has a degree of substitution of at least 0.1
carboxymethyl group per glucose unit and is characterised in
that the fibre is derived from solvent-spun cellulose fibre
and has an absorbency of at least 8 grams 0.9% saline
solution per gram of fibre, as measured by the free swell
method, and a tenacity of at least 10 cN/tex.A process according to the invention for the
production of carboxymethyl cellulose fibre by reacting
cellulose fibre with a strong alkali and a monochloroacetic
reagent selected from monochloroacetic acid and salts
thereof is characterised in that the cellulose
