relative to the side-wall columns (14), in which false floor panel (11, 28) is a
multi-layer composite panel with an outer layer, a base layer and an intermediate

layer consisting of foamed plastic material and is held by means of brackets (29, 31)
associated with the side-wall columns (14) and secured, on the one hand, to the

panel (11, 28), characterised in that a plurality of brackets (29, 31) are arranged at a

distance from one another along each side wall on either side of the vehicle body,
thereby forming intermediate spaces, and that the false floor panel (11, 28) is self-supporting

between the brackets (29, 31).
Framework structure according to claim 1, characterised in that the false floor panel
(11, 28) has open profiles at its edges.
Framework structure according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the false
floor panel (11, 28) is made in one part and extends substantially over the base of

the framework structure.
Framework stucture according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the

brackets (29, 31) are secured to at least one end lace of each side-wall column (14)
by means of a tongue or a bulb (45, 54, 55) engaging in a groove (53) in the sidewall

column (14), and a horizontally extending tongue, bulb, double tongue or
double bulb is provided on a lower, inwardly directed side of the bracket (29, 31)
