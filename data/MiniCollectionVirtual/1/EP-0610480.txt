<ABSTRACT>
In a feed device for kneaders, worm extruders or the like with at least one feed shaft (1) and at least one ram (2), where the feed shaft (1) has at least one loading aperture (3), the ram (2) and all or part of the feed shaft (1) are curved into an arc. The ram (2) can swivel about an axis (5) forming the centre of the arc. Thus the face plate (6) of the ram (2) follows an arc-shaped course.

Feed device for kneaders, worm extruders or the like with
at least one feed shaft (1 or 14) and with at least one

packing means (2 or 20, 21), wherein said feed shaft is
equipped with at least one loading opening (3) and is

curved at least partially in a circular arc shape, and
wherein each packing means is arranged to swivel around a

pivot point (3 or 16, 17) forming the centre point of the
circular arc-shaped curve, so that the end plate (6 or 23,

24) of each packing means follows a circular arc-shaped
path of motion,

characterised in that

each packing means (2 or 20, 21) is likewise curved in a
circular arc shape and the feed shaft (1 or 14)

additionally has an opening, through which each packing
means is swivelled fully outwards from the feed shaft.
Feed device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
cooling holes (7), a mass temperature sensor and/or an

injection valve are provided on the underside of the
packing means (2).
Feed device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that grooves (9) are provided on the underside of the

packing means (2) to receive brushes, stripping devices or
similar.
Feed device according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in
that the swivelling motion of the packing means (2) is

effected by a drive means, which operates the packing means
(2) in the manner of an angle lever.
Feed device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that two packing means (20, 21) arranged
adjacent are provided. 
Feed device for a worm extruder according to one of Claims
1 to 5, characterised in that the two paths of motion of

the packing means (20, 21) run opposite one another in a
transverse plane to the extruder worm (12) of the worm

extruder; in that the wall (22) of the feed shaft (14) is
plane in the region of the packing means (20, 21) and is

provided with a respective opening for passage of each of
the packing means (20, 21), and in that the packing means

(20, 21) are disposed to swivel around pivot axes (16, 17),
which are located approximately in the extension of the

feed shaft (14) and on both sides of the extruder worm (12)
lying at its level and parallel thereto.
Feed device according to Claim 6, characterised in that
side walls (25, 26) extending in the direction of the path

of motion adjoin the end plates (23, 24) of the two packing
means (20, 21), the length of said side walls corresponding

to the stroke of the packing means (20, 21).
Feed device according to Claim 6 or 7, characterised in
that in the region of the side walls (25, 26) of the two

packing means (20, 21) located remote from the extruder
worm (12), the feed shaft (14) is equipped with inwardly

pointing stripping devices (30) and the end plates (23, 24)
of the two packing means (20, 21) are provided with

stripping edges (31) on their sides facing the pivot axes
(16, 17), said stripping edges sliding along the transition

wall (15) of the feed shaft (14), which is drawn in here
towards the extruder worm (12) and shaped in a manner

corresponding to the motion of the two packing means (20,
21).
