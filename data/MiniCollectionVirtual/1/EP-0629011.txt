<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrode using 
carbon fibers and a chargeable/dischargeable secondary battery 
using the same. In recent years, small secondary batteries having high 
capacitance have been remarkably demanded with the spread of 
portable devices such as video cameras and notebook-type personal 
computers. Most of the secondary batteries currently used are 
nickel-cadmium batteries which use alkaline electrolytic 
solutions. Such secondary batteries, however, show low battery 
voltages of about 1.2 V, and therefore are difficult to be 
improved in energy density. Under these circumstances, it has 
been investigated the high energy-type secondary batteries using 
lithium metal, which is the basest metal, for negative electrode. However, the secondary batteries in which lithium metal 
is used for negative electrode have disadvantages such that the 
lithium develops to dendrites by the (re)charging/discharging 
cycle, which may cause a short circuit and further cause the 
danger of ignition of the batteries. In addition, as lithium 
metal used in a secondary battery is very active, such a battery 
itself involves highly dangerous factors. Therefore, they are 
questionable in domestic applicability. In order to solve the 
problems relating to safety described above, lithium ion 
secondary batteries using various carbonaceous materials have 
been proposed recently, by which high energy inherent to the  
 
lithium electrode can be given. The secondary batteries of this 
type are devised by utilizing the phenomenon that, since the 
carbonaceous material doped with lithium ions at charging comes 
to have the same electric potential as metal lithium, the 
carbonaceous material doped with lithium ions can be used for 
negative electrode in place of metal lithium. In this type of 
secondary battery, when discharged, the lithium ions which have 
been doped to the carbonaceous material are dedoped from the 
negative electrode and go back to the carbonaceous material to 
which the lithium ions have been doped originally. Therefore, 
the use of carbonaceous material doped with lithium ions for 
negative electrode never causes the problem of dendrite 
production, and furthermore gives excellent safety since metal 
lithium is not present; therefore has now been investigated 
extensively. As the secondary batteries utilizing the doping of 
lithium ions to carbonaceous material, those have been known, for 
example, disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 
90863/1987 and 122066/1987.
