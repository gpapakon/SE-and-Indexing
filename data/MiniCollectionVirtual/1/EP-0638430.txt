<ABSTRACT>
A computer printer tray system comprising a paper 
input tray (20) and a paper output tray (70), neither of which 

is required to have any moving parts. The output tray (70) is 
supported in part by the input tray (20) and both trays of the 

system are semi-permanently cantilever supported from the front 
of the printer so that neither tray has to be removed when 

loading an unprinted stack of cut sheet paper or removing 
printed paper. The output tray (70) has a first portion (74) 

which is inclined from a second portion (76) by about 10Â° to 
correct paper curl caused by a wet printing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to paper input and output 
trays for computer driven printers, and, more particularly, for 
inkjet printers. Inkjet printers have been provided with permanently 
attached paper input trays which necessarily give the printer a 
larger footprint during shipping thus requiring larger containers 
than are required for printers having detachable paper input 
trays. Printer paper input and output trays are regularly 
accessed by the printer operator and may be removable or 
permanently attached trays. The former are removed from the 
printer whenever the paper supply is exhausted for refilling with 
a stack of cut sheet paper. Printers with removable trays occupy 
a smaller footprint and therefore can be shipped in smaller 
containers but they have other drawbacks. Removable trays 
usually have a spring biased pusher plate beneath the paper stack 
for urging paper upwardly toward the printer feed rollers which 
remove one sheet at a time from the stack. Repeated removal, 
loading and reinstallation of the paper tray in the printer is 
a relatively easy task provided that care is taken to properly 
remove the tray, load the paper and reinstall the tray. Despite 
ordinary precautions, through repeated usage, removable paper 
trays, and the parts thereon such as the pusher plate and 
particularly the parts thereof that connect the tray to the 
printer, are subject to wear and eventual breakage. Similarly, paper output trays are ordinarily easily 
removable trays which are hung on the front of the printer with 
plastic hooks or the like which are subject to breakage.  
 
Particularly in printers such as inkjet printers which 
apply print to the paper using wet ink, paper curl which 
usually takes place about the long center axis of the 
paper is also a problem. EP-A-0237026 and EP-A-0292094 disclose printer 
systems with input and output paper trays which are 
removable from the printer chassis, the output tray being 
located above the input tray. Accordingly, a semi-permanently attached paper tray 
system for a printer such as an inkjet printer is desired 
which, after installation by the user, is intended to 
remain in place on the printer even during paper loading 
so as to minimize the frequency of tray removal and 
attendant breakage. Both trays of the system should 
still be removable when desired without special tools and 
both trays should be easily accessible, preferably from 
the front of the printer, whereby paper can be loaded 
into the input tray without removal of

<CLAIMS>
A printer system comprising: 

a chassis member (50,60); 
an input tray (20) for holding a plurality of media 
sheets, said input tray being removable from said chassis 

member during non-use of the printing system, such as 
during shipment; 
an output tray (70) mounted above said input tray 
and on the same side of said chassis member as said input 

tray for receiving a printed media sheet, said output 
tray being removable from said chassis member during non-use 

such as during shipment; and 
mounting means (25,27;88,90) for mounting said input 
tray and said output tray on said chassis member during 

use of the printer system, said mounting means including 
a pair of elongated cantilever arms on said input tray 

and elongated receiving apertures (53,63) on said chassis for 
slidably receiving said arms, at least one of said arms 

being laterally resilient, with said input tray being 
manually accessible for loading an unprinted stack of 

media sheets without having to remove said input tray or 
said output tray from said chassis member. 
A printing system as in claim 1, wherein said output 
tray (70) is manually accessible for removing a printed 

sheet without having to remove said input tray or said 
output tray. 
A printing system as in claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
output tray is partially supported by said input tray. 
A printing system as in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
said chassis member is part of an inkjet printer. 
A printing system as in any preceding claim, including 
a movable shelf member (130) on said chassis member  

 
and aligned with said input tray (20) when said input 

tray is removably mounted on said chassis member, said 
shelf member being biased upwardly and positioned to 

underlay an end portion of said media sheets in said 
input tray to facilitate individual media sheets being 

picked from a stack in said input tray. 
A method of storage and use of input and output 
trays for an inkjet printer system, comprising the 

following steps: 

removably mounting the input tray (20) on a printer 
by slidably engaging cantilever arms extending from said 

input tray with receiving apertures in a printer chassis 
while laterally deforming at least one of said arms, so 

that the input tray can be removed from the printer 
during shipment, and so that the input tray can remain in 

mounted position on the printer during operation of the 
printer as well as during reloading of media into the 

input tray; and 
removably mounting the output tray (70) above said 
input tray on the printer and extending laterally from 

the same side of the printer, so that the output tray can 
be removed from the printer during shipment, and so that 

the output tray can remain in mounted position on the 
printer during operation of the printer as well as during 

reloading of media into the input tray. 
A method as in claim 6, which further includes the 
steps of aligning the input tray (20) so that a forward 

portion of media sheets stacked in the input tray rest on 
a movable shelf (130) on the printer; and biasing the 

movable shelf upwardly to facilitate the printer picking 
individual sheets from the input tray.
