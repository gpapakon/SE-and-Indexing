<ABSTRACT>
A paper magazine is proposed which is capable of 
feeding and rewinding a web of paper automatically without 

forming any indentation or causing meandering. 
A pair of press rollers and a paper detection roller 
are provided on a feed path extending from the core of a 

paper roll in the paper magazine case to the paper outlet. 
Also, the cam plate and the engaging roller are provided to 

control the movement of the press rollers toward and away 
from each other according to the position of the paper 

detection roller. The transmission of driving force to the 
core of the paper roll and the press rollers is changed 

over according to the position of the paper detection 
roller. The press rollers are pressed against the paper 

only when feeding and rewinding it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a paper magazine for feeding 
and rewinding a photographic paper from and into a roll of 
paper rotatably mounted thereon and used e.g. to feed a web 
of photographic paper to a photographic printing apparatus. As shown in Fig. 20, a photographic printing 
apparatus has a light source 81 that emits light through a 
mirror tunnel 82 at a negative film 84 on a negative mask 
83 to print the negative images on the negative film 84 
through a printing lens 85 onto photographic paper P on an 
exposure unit 86. This conventional photographic printing apparatus B 
carries a plurality of paper magazines A, A' accommodating 
a roll R of photographic paper P having different print 
sizes from each other. The photographic paper P in one of 
the paper magazines A is pulled out to the exposure unit 86 
for printing. When changing the print size, after 
rewinding the photographic paper into the paper magazine A, 
the photographic paper in the other paper magazine A' is 
pulled out. When changing the photographic paper in one paper 
magazine to the paper in the other, a cutter device 87 
disposed in the feed path of photographic paper extending 
from the paper magazine A to the exposure unit 86 is  
 
activated to cut the photographic paper P. Then, the 
portion of the photographic paper P that protrudes from the 
paper magazine A is rewound into it. Then, the 
photographic paper P in the other paper magazine A' is 
pulled out until its tip is caught between a pair of 
advance rollers 54 provided in the paper feed path. Such conventional paper magazines for feeding and 
rewinding photographic paper come in two types, that is, 
the type having a built-in feeding and rewinding mechanism 
and the type having no such mechanism (see for instance US-A-5 181 066 and US-A- 5 107 296) . When using a paper 
magazine of the latter type, photographic paper is put in 
the magazine with its tip protruding slightly from the 
magazine. The magazine is then set in the photographic 
printing apparatus B with the protruding end of the paper 
caught between the advance rollers 54. On the other hand, a paper magazine of the former 
type has a feed roller adapted to be pressed against the 
photographic paper and provided near the paper outlet of 
the paper magazine. By manually controlling a knob coupled 
to the feed roller, the photographic paper is fed and 
rewound. When using a paper magazine without the feeding and 
rewinding mechanism, since the tip of the paper has to 
protrude from the magazine, this

<CLAIMS>
A paper magazine (A) comprising a paper magazine case (1) for 
rotatably supporting a core (5) of a paper roll (R) of paper (P), said 

paper magazine case being formed with a paper outlet (3), characterized in that the paper magazine further comprises a 
pair of press rollers (7, 8) provided along a paper feed path 

extending from said core to said paper outlet and adapted 
to be pressed against and separated from each other with 

the paper therebetween, a paper detection roller (30) provided 
at said paper feed path between said press rollers and said paper outlet so as to 

be displaced therefrom when paper passing through said paper feed path contacts said paper detection roller, a cam 
mechanism (16-24) associated with said paper detection roller for 

pressing and separating said press rollers against and from 
each other according to the position of said paper 

detection roller, power transmission means (36) for 
transmitting the rotation of an external driving 

means to said 
core of the paper roll and said press rollers, and changeover means (31-32, 38-39) provided in said power 

transmission means for selectively transmitting the driving 
force to said core or said press rollers according to the 

direction of rotation of said external driving means, 
whereby said press rollers are pressed against each other 

with the paper therebetween when said core is rotated in a 
direction to feed the paper forward and said press rollers 

are separated from each other at any other time.  
 
A paper magazine as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
cam mechanism is operatively associated with said paper 

detection roller so that when the leading end of the paper passes the paper detection roller during rewinding, the paper detection roller is displaced and 
said cam mechanism operates in such a way as to 

press said press rollers against each other with the paper 
therebetween. 
A paper magazine as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
cam mechanism comprises means (16,17) for pressing said press 

rollers against each other with the paper therebetween when 
said core is rotated in a direction for rewinding the 

paper, and means (17,20) for keeping said press rollers pressed 
against each other irrespective of the position of said 

paper detection roller. 
A paper magazine as claimed in any of claims 1-3 
further comprising a torque limiter (61) for cutting off the 

connection between said paper detection roller and said cam 
mechanism when said torque limiter is subjected to a torque 

higher than a predetermined torque. 
A paper magazine as claimed in any of claims 1-4 
further comprising a locking plate (44) connected to said 

paper detection roller and adapted to engage said power  
 

transmission means, said locking plate being moved in such 
a direction as to cut off the transmission of power to said 

core when said paper detection roller is displaced when the leading end of the paper passes the paper detection roller. 
A paper magazine as claimed in any of claims 1-5 
further comprising a friction generating means (48) provided 

between said core of the paper roll and said power 
transmission means for imparting a frictional force to said 

core while said core is rotating relative to said power 
transmission means.
