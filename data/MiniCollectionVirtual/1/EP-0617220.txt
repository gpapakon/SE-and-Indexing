<ABSTRACT>
A coupled pipe assembly having a pair of opposed, 
axially-positioned pipes (10,12) each having opposed beveled 

ends (16,18) and 
interior corrosion-resistant linings (25). A sleeve (26) having 

heat-deflecting 
material (34) is provided axially within the pipes with 

the heat-deflecting material being positioned adjacent the 
opposed pipe ends to protect the corrosion-resistant linings 

from heat damage during welding of the pipe ends. The sleeve 
has a tapered cross-section extending to and forming a 

rounded end edge portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coupled pipe assembly 
wherein the opposed ends of pipes having an internal coating 
or lining of corrosion-resistant material are joined by 
welding. An internal sleeve is used in association with the 
coupled pipe ends to protect the corrosion-resistant lining 
of the pipes from heat damage incident to the welding 
operation. For this purpose, the internal sleeve has an 
internal corrosion-resistance lining. Each end of the sleeve 
has a tapered cross-section forming a rounded edge portion. In various applications, such as in the oil and gas 
industry, there is a need for alloy pipe, such as steel pipe, 
provided with a lining of corrosion-resistant material. For 
this purpose, it is known to bond to the pipe interior 
various epoxy based materials, polyethylene, polyvinyl 
chloride and other thermoplastic and thermosetting materials. 
With pipe having these internal coatings, it is necessary to 
protect the homogenous integrity of the internal coating from 
damage from heat generated during the welding of the pipe 
ends. It is known for this purpose to use an internal sleeve 
with a heat-deflecting barrier positioned adjacent the weld 
zone of the opposed pipe ends. Coupled pipe assemblies of 
this type are disclosed in Abbema et al., U.S. Patent No. 
4,913,465, issued April 3, 1990. With conventional assemblies of this type, during 
welding of the pipe ends the integrity of the corrosion-resistant 
lining in the pipe is destroyed, particularly at 
portions near the weld.  
 With coupled pipe assemblies including the coupled pipe 
assembly of the aforementioned patent, it is necessary to 
inspect the assembled pipeline for discontinuities, such as 
cracks, corrosion, body wall loss and the like. This is 
typically achieved by ultrasonic techniques. For this 
purpose, a transducer is inserted through the pipeline to the 
coupling thereof. With assemblies having internal sleeves 
used to replace the interior corrosion-resistance coating of 
the pipes during welding, effective insertion and removal of 
the transducer is impaired by the sleeve. Specifically, the 
transducer will engage the sleeve ends to prevent the end of 
the transducer from passing beyond the sleeve. This may 
result in damage to the transducer, damage to the internal 
coating within the pipeline, the sleeve or both, and overall 
renders a "smart pigging" inspection operation impossible. 
In addition, the sleeve ends increase the coefficient of 
friction of the fluid flowing through the pipe and against 
the

A coupled pipe assembly comprising, a pair of 
opposed, axially positioned pipes (10,12) each having opposed beveled 

ends spaced apart to form a separated area therebetween, a 
corrosion-resistant lining (25) on interior surfaces of said 

pipes, a sleeve (26) having an internal corrosion-resistant lining (29) 
and a uniform, continuous diameter portion along a length 

thereof inserted axially within said pipes between said 
opposed beveled ends along a uniform continuous diameter 

portion of said pipes, said sleeve including each end thereof 
having an internally tapered cross-section (43) extending to and 

forming a rounded end edge portion (44), a pair of O-ring seals (28) 
each circumferentially mounted on said sleeve a distance from 

each end thereof and in sealing engagement with said interior 
surfaces of said pipes, a circumferential relieved area (32) in an 

exterior surface of said sleeve between said O-ring seals, a 
layer (34) of heat-deflecting material provided within said 

relieved area and having an outer surface terminating short 
of said exterior surface of said sleeve, a plurality of 

retainers (36) for retaining said heat-deflecting material within 
said relieved area of said sleeve, said retainers being 

connected to opposed edge surfaces of said relieved area in 
spaced-apart relation and each of said retainers having a lug (38) 

radially extending into said separated area between said 
opposed, beveled pipe ends and in contact therewith, a continuous 

weld deposit (40) produced in said separated area and 
bonded to each said lug and to the opposed beveled pipe ends 

to form a welded joint between said opposed ends of said 
pipes and a sealant (42) provided between said exterior surface of 

said sleeve and said interior surfaces of said pipes.

said internally tapered cross-section extending 

along an area of said sleeve within which said pair of O-ring 
seals are circumferentially mounted. 
The coupled pipe assembly of claim 1 further comprising, 
said internally tapered cross-section terminating 

short of said relieved area. 
The coupled pipe assembly of claims 1 or 2 further 
comprising, said relieved area and layer of heat-deflecting 

material provided therein being substantially centrally 
disposed relative to said separated area between said opposed 

pipe ends. 
The coupled pipe assembly of claim 4 further comprising, 
said separated area of said opposed beveled ends of 

said pipes having a narrowed portion within which each lug is 
positioned and a diverging portion extending from said 

narrowed portion in which said weld deposit is produced. 
The coupled pipe assembly of claim 5 further comprising, 
each of said retainers extending across said 

relieved area adjacent said outer surface of said heat-deflecting 
material and each said lug being centrally 

disposed on each said associated retainer.
