<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to yeast, recombinant DNA 
techniques, and to processes for detecting inhibitors and/or 
activators of potassium channels. The uptake of potassium ions in yeast cells occurs 
primarily through two specific proteins―a high and a low affinity 
potassium ion transporter. Rodriguez-Navarro and Ramos, J. 
Bacteriol.159:940-945 (1984); Gaber, Styles, and Fink, Mol. Cell 
Biol.8:2848-2859 (1988); Ko and Gaber, Genetics125: 305-312 
(1990). Two genes, designated TRK1 and TRK2 (for transporter of 
K) encode the high and low affinity transporters, respectively. 
Yeast strains that contain mutations in TRK1 and TRK2 exhibit a 
growth defect on media with minimal potassium ion (K⁺) 
concentrations. In comparison to wild-type strains, which grow on 
media with as little as 5 µM potassium ion, transporter mutant 
strains require media supplemented with 100 mM potassium ion. 
Two laboratories used such deficient strains to isolate foreign 
plant genes that complement the growth defect on potassium-deficient 
media. Anderson, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.89: 
3736-3740 (1992); Sentenac, et al., Science256: 663-666 (1992). In other species, a number of potassium channels have 
been cloned by molecular biological techniques. Many of these 
cloned channels are voltage-dependent potassium ion channels  
 
related to the Drosophila shaker channel. Several others are 
novel potassium ion channels. Hille, Ionic Channels of Excitable 
Membranes (1992); Strong et al., Mol. Biol. Evol. 10: 221-242 
(1993). One such newly discovered channel is the minK, or IsK , 
or IKs, channel, which has only 129-130 amino acids. Murai et al., 
Bioch. Biophys. Res. Comm. 161: 176-181 (1989); Swanson et al., 
Sem. Neurosci. 5: 117-124 (1993). A recent report indicates that 
residues 41 to 72 define the pore of the protein and are sufficient 
to form channels in lipid bilayers. Ben-Efraim et al., Biochemistry32: 
2371-2377 (1993). The channel minK displays very slow 
activation and inactivation kinetics. Philipson and Miller, TIPS13:8-11 
(1992). It is expressed in a number of tissues, including 
kidney, uterus and heart and in a number of species including 
humans. Swanson et al., Sem. Neurosci. 5: 117-124 (1993); 
Freeman and Kass, Biophysical J. 64: 342 (abstract) (1993). Of considerable interest is the role of minK in the heart. It 
was known that ventricular cells have a repolarizing current, called 
the delayed rectifier. Recent evidence suggests that the delayed 
rectifier has two components: a rapid,
