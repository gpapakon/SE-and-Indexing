precise measurement of distances to positions on the surface of a three-dimensional 

object (4). The measuring procedure comprises the steps of: calculating count values 
(C
1
 and C
2
) indicative respectively of angle differences (ϑ
1
 and ϑ
2
) of a scanning mirror 
where slit light (3S) reflected from a reference plane set at first, second and third 

positions (S0, S1 and S2) is incident upon a predetermined one of sensing cells (P
ij
) 
arranged on an image pickup plane (7); calculating a count value (C
X
) indicative of an 
angle difference between an angle (ϑ
S2
) of the scanning mirror where the slit light 
reflected from the reference plane at the third position thereof is incident upon the said 

cell on the image pickup plane, and another angle (ϑ
SX
) of the scanning mirror where 
the slit light reflected from the surface of the object is incident upon the said cell on the 

image pickup plane; and executing a predetermined calculation to obtain the distance 
(X) between the first
 position S0 and the object surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for measuring a distance and, more particularly,
for measuring the external shape of a three-dimensional
object.According to one of the distance measuring methods
known heretofore, positions on the surface of a
three-dimensional object are measured by scanning the
surface with a beam of slit light while rotating a scanning
mirror, and detecting the points in time when the slit light
reflected from the object surface passes through sensing
cells arranged on an image pickup plane.Fig. 11 shows an exemplary conventional apparatus
which carries out such distance measuring method. In this
example, an infrared or similar laser beam emitted from a
laser light source 1 is formed into slit light via an
optical device 2. The slit laser light is then reflected by
a scanning mirror 3 consisting of a galvano mirror or the
like disposed at a predetermined position. The slit light
3S thus reflected from the scanning mirror 3 scans the
surface of a three-dimensional object 4, which is to be
measured, with rotation of the mirror 3.The slit light reflected from the object 4 is
focused on an image pickup plane 7 via an optical device 6.
In a controller 5C comprising a differentiator, an
integrator and other components, the rotational position of
the scanning mirror 3 is detected by finding the point in 
time when the slit light reflected from the object 4
passes through each of the image sensing cells, i.e.,
light receiving cells Pij arranged two-dimensionally on
the image pickup plane 7. The distance up to the
object 4 is measured trigonometrically per sensing cell
Pij on the image pickup plane 7 from the positional
relationship among the rotational position of the
scanning mirror 3, the image pickup plane 7 and the
scanning mirror 3. Such conventional apparatus are
disclosed in document US 4,794,262 and document Araki
K. et al.: "High Speed and Continuous Rangefinding
System", IEICE Transactions, vol. E74, no. 10,
1 October 1991.Fig. 12 schematically shows the principle of
measuring three-dimensional coordinate positions on the
surface of the object 4 according to the method of
triangulation. The distance Zij from the image pickup
plane 7 to one surface position on the object 4 whose
reflected slit light is focused on the sensing cell Pij
of the image pickup plane 7 can be obtained
trigonometrically from Eq. (1) by using the distance
Bij between the focused position on the image pickup
plane 7 and the rotational center of the scanning
mirror 3, the angle αij
