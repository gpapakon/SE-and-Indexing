<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a liner (4) for a container 
closure for disposition on the neck of a container (7), said 

closure comprising crown (1) and a peripherally depending 
skirt (2), said liner being formed of a resilient material 

retained on the under side of the crown and being provided at 
its intended point of abutment with the rim (10) of the 

container neck (9) on its downwardly directed face with a pair 
of radially annular ribs (19, 20) for cooperation with the rim 

of the container neck for with which it is to be used, wherein 
the pair of concentric annular ribs are disposed adjacent each 

other with their juxtaposed faces (21) exceeding in width the 
contact surface of the rim (10) of the container neck with the 

proviso that the radially inner of said ribs (20) does not 
comprise an unsupported inclined plane. This arrangement 

allows for better sealing of container closures, particularly 
those formed of plastics material such as PET.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container closure and
profiled liner assembly and particularly such an assembly
adapted to alleviate the problem of leakage of gas from
containers under pressure.As may be seen from Figures 1A to 2B of the drawings
accompanying this Specification closures having profiled
liners for disposition upon the neck of a container are known.
In particular such prior art closures comprise a crown (1)
with a circumferentially depending skirt (2) formed of a
plastics material. The outer surface of the skirt (2) is
provided with a knurl (3) in order to assist gripping of the
closure in use. A profiled liner (4) is disposed on the
underside of the crown. In use the neck of a container (7)
which is provided with a screw thread (8) and a rim (9) is
provided for interengagement with this prior art closure. When
the closure is screwed on to the screw thread (8) the contact
face (10) of the rim (9) is driven upwardly until it contacts
the underside of the profiled liner (4). In the arrangement
shown in Figures 1A and 1B the liner is formed in situ from
a thermoplastic or a thermosetting material and is retained
against separation prior to use within the closure by means
of an outer annular rib (14) which acts to retain the profiled
liner within the closure and to provide a reservoir of
material for sealing purposes against the contact face (10)
of the rim (9).Closures of this prior art type may be utilised with plastics
or glass containers which are almost always moulded. Although
the glass or plastics rim (9) is normally moulded to close
tolerances, inevitably some moulded products have
discontinuities in their external face and accordingly leakage
paths (12), as shown in Figure 1B, allow gas under pressure
to escape from containers, e.g. bottles, such as those used
for carbonated beverages, particularly if returned for reuse. This happens, for example, particularly when the ambient
temperature is raised. In the arrangement shown in Figure 1,
the liner material is comparatively hard and this contributes
to the possibility that leakage paths (12) will be formed in
the event that the container rim is damaged. Further there is
a particular problem with closures for plastics (eg PET)
containers because the threaded portions associated therewith,
are relatively long in the axial direction, thus decreasing
the sealing area and increasing the need for effective lateral
sealing in the small space left. Further, in such
arrangements "top" seal must be particularly effective.An immediate solution

<CLAIMS>
A container closure and profiled liner assembly, the
closure being adapted for disposition upon the neck of the

container (7) and comprising a crown (1) and a peripherally
depending skirt (2), said liner being formed of a resilient

material retained in the underside of the crown, and being
provided on its downwardly directed face with at least one

annular sealing rib (19, 20) for cooperation with the rim of
the container;


characterised in that the underside of the crown is
provided with at least one downwardly depending formation (13,

25) directly above and in cooperation with said annular
sealing rib thereby to support the same in use.
An assembly according to claim 1 wherein a pair of
radially spaced annular ribs (19, 20) is provided on the

underside of the liner, the juxtaposed faces (21) of the ribs
exceeding in width a contact surface of the rim of the

intended container neck.
An assembly according to claim 2 wherein the juxtaposed
faces (21) of the ribs have mutually symmetric or asymmetric

surfaces.
An assembly according to claims 2 or 3 wherein the
juxtaposed faces of the ribs are spaced apart at their point

of juncture (22) with the liner.
An assembly according to claim 4 wherein a notional
median line (11) of the intended container neck passes in use

through, or immediately adjacent, the point of juncture (22)
of the juxtaposed face of the outer rib of the liner. 
An assembly according to any preceding claim, provided
on the inner face of the skirt adjacent the crown with a

radially inwardly directed projection (5) adapted to retain
the liner 
in situ
 against the underside of the crown.
An assembly according to claim 6 wherein the radial
projection (5) is configured to retain a distal surface of a

radially outer of the annular ribs (19).
An assembly according to claim 7 wherein the
configuration of the projection (5) and distal surface of the

outer radially rib (19) are in close abutment, and wherein the
distal surface of the outer rib conjoins the radial projection

at the point at which the distal surface of the outer rib also
conjoins a contact surface (21) of the outer rib.
An assembly according to any one of claims 2 to 8 wherein
the crown is provided on its underside with two radially

spaced downwardly depending formations (13, 25) in register
with each of said ribs (19, 20) respectively.
