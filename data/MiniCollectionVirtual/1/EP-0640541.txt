<ABSTRACT>
A coil packing line in which coils (W) are packed by a 
plurality of operation processes (S₁-S₂₁) is provided. 

The coil 
packing line is provided with a plurality of work stations 

(S₁-S₂₁,T), 
stationary skid mechanisms (40), carriage mechanisms (2) and a 

plurality of reciprocating mechanisms (7). 
Each operation process (S₁-S₂₁) 

has a corresponding work station (40). The stationary skid 
mechanisms (40) are provided at each work station (S₁-S₂₁) 

for supporting a 
coil (W) at the work station (S). The carriage mechanisms are 

provided between each work station (S) for removing a coil (W) from an 
upstream stationary skid mechanism (40), supporting the coil (W) and 

depositing the coil (W) at a downstream stationary skid mechanism (40). 
The plurality of reciprocating mechanisms (2) independently move 

at least one carriage mechanism (2) back and forth between the 
upstream and downstream stationary skid mechanisms (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a coil
packing line for packing coils, such as coiled steel, and,
more particularly, to a coil packing line in which coils are
moved within the coil packing line using reciprocating
carriages having a hoisting and lowering mechanism, thereby
overcoming the problems in the conventional coil packing lines
of the chain conveyor type, etc.Sheet metal products obtained by rolling are generally
wound into metal coils (hereinafter simply referred to as
"coils"), which are packed in packing material for shipment.The coil packing line for packing these coils uses a
chain conveyor or a walking beam as the equipment for
conveying the packed coils, all the coils in the line being
conveyed simultaneously at a fixed pitch (distance from one
another).Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 56-162217 discloses
conventional chain conveyor type coil conveying equipment,
which equipment is shown in Figs. 8 and 9. In this
conventional equipment, a number of saddles 51, which are
arranged at a fixed pitch, are conveyed by a chain conveyor
50, with each saddle supporting a coil W to be conveyed.However, such a conventional coil packing line using a
chain conveyor or a walking beam, which simultaneously conveys
a number of coils at a fixed pitch, has the following
problems.Firstly, due to the large installation space for the
packing line, a large floor space is required. Also, the
return side of the line is below the surface of the floor, so
that a deep foundation is required, resulting in a high
foundation construction cost. Secondly, the conveyance of coils cannot be started until
the packing processes for all the coils in the packing line
have been completed, so that the expensive automatic packing
machinery provided in the line works at a rather poor rate of
operation, i.e., spends more time than optimal in a non-operational
state.Thirdly, due to structural limitations, the distance
between adjacent coils being conveyed is fixed. Therefore,
even if the optimum distance between adjacent stages (and thus
adjacent coils) is known, it is necessary in reality to choose
a distance which is approximately an integral multiple of the
various optimum distances (conveyance pitches) and which is
larger than that optimum distance between any two adjacent
stages. Thus, the length of the entire packing line becomes
excessively large, resulting in a high construction cost.To solve the above problems, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 2-286510 proposes an apparatus in which the conveyance
between the
