<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multilayered 
polymeric body comprising multiple optical thickness layer 
types, at least a portion of which are in a folded 
relationship, which body reflects light and which can be 
fabricated to have an iridescent or silvery appearance; to 
decorative articles produced therefrom which may find use 
as wall panels, dishware, and decorative trims; and to 
security articles produced therefrom which may find use in 
anticounterfeiting applications. The present invention provides a multilayered 
polymeric reflective body which can be iridescent or 
silvery in appearance, highly reflective, post formable, 
and capable of being fabricated into a variety of 
decorative and/or security articles. The introduction of 
folded-over layers into the otherwise substantially planar 
layer structure of the body produces unique optical 
effects. The terms "reflective", "reflectivity", 
"reflection", and "reflectance" as used herein refer to 
total reflectance (that is, ratio of reflected wave energy 
to incident wave energy). For bodies which are silvery in 
appearance, the reflectance is sufficiently specular in 
nature such that the polymeric body has a metallic 
appearance. The use of these terms is intended to 
encompass semi-specular or diffuse reflection such as that 
of brushed metal and pewter. A specific intensity of reflectance, when used herein, 
is the intensity of reflection which occurs at a wavelength 
where negligible absorption occurs. For example, a silver 
appearing article reflects substantially all visible 
wavelengths (white light), whereas the introduction of a 
dye to achieve other metallic hues will necessarily lower  
 
reflectivity of the body at the absorbing wavelengths. 
Wavelengths unaffected by the dye will be reflected at 
essentially the same intensity as a non-dyed sample, and it 
is at these unaffected wavelengths to which the intensity 
of reflectance is referring. Likewise, where an article 
exhibits iridescent color, the intensity of reflection is 
measured at a wavelength corresponding to the color 
exhibited. According to one aspect of the present invention, a 
multilayer reflective polymeric body of at least first and 
second diverse polymeric materials is provided in which the 
first and second polymeric materials differ from each other 
in refractive index by at least 0.03. The body should 
comprise a sufficient number of alternating layers of the 
first and second polymeric materials such that at least a 
portion of the light incident on
