<ABSTRACT>
Modified wool having improved shrink-proofing 
property is obtained by a two step process in which raw 

material wool is first immersed in a first aqueous bath 
containing a water-soluble organic phosphine and is then 

immersed in a second aqueous bath containing a modifying 
agent selected 
from epoxy compounds, ethyleneimine compounds, 
urea, substituted urea compounds, thiourea, substituted 

thiourea compounds, alkylene carbonates, unsaturated 
carboxylic acids, derivatives of unsaturated carboxylic 

acids, unsaturated nitriles, unsaturated alcohols, esters of 
an unsaturated alcohol, sulfonic acid salts having a vinyl 

group, cyanic acid salts, nonionic surfactants of a 
poly(alkylene oxide) type, salts of sulfates of the nonionic 

surfactants and silane coupling agents having a vinyl group. 
The treatment may also be performed by a one step process in 

which wool is immersed in an aqueous bath containing the 
above phosphine compound and a modifying agent selected from 

the above.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process of treating
wool for imparting shrink-proofing thereto. The
present invention also provides a modified wool.It is well knownthat wool is apt to be shrunk upon
being washed. One known method for preventing such shrinkage
includes removing scale edges of the surfaces of the hair
fibers or filling the scale edges with a resinous substance
so as to suppress the tendency of the fibers to entwine with
each other. The known method, however, has problems because
the shrink-proofing effect is not satisfactory and because
the softness, color and strength of the wool are adversely
affected. For example, the Kroy-Harcosett method which is
currently most widely adopted to impart shrink-proofing
property to wool causes defects that the soft fluffy feeling
is lost and the treated wool becomes similar to synthetic
acrylic fibers and turns yellow.WO-89-02497 (International Publication) teaches
that shrink-proofing property may be imparted to wool by
treatment with a water-soluble organic phosphine compound.
With this method, it is necessary to use the phosphine
compound in a high concentration in order to obtain
satisfactory shrink-proofing property. In this case,
however, the wool fibers are considerably damaged and
deteriorated.Textile Research Journal, Vol. 51,5, (1981),
pages 317-323 discloses that the level of shrink-resistance
that can be achieved by the application of a polyether
polyurethane, Synthappret LKF, to wool fabric can be
increased if the wool is pretreated with sodium bisulphite
or tri-n-butyl phosphine.The present invention has been made with the
foregoing problems of the conventional methods in view. In
accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a process of treating wool for imparting
shrink-proofing property thereto, comprising the steps of
immersing the wool in a first aqueous bath containing a 
water-soluble organic phosphine to obtain a pretreated wool,
and then immersing said pretreated wool in a second aqueous
bath containing a modifying agent selected from epoxy compounds, ethyleneimine
compounds, urea compounds, thiourea compounds, alkylene carbonates,
unsaturated carboxylic acids, derivatives of unsaturated
carboxylic acids, unsaturated nitriles, unsaturated alcohols,
esters of an unsaturated alcohol, sulfonic acid salts having
a vinyl group, cyanic acid salts and silane coupling agents having a vinyl group.In another aspect, the present invention provides
a process of treating wool for imparting shrink-proofing
property
