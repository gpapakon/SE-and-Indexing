<ABSTRACT>
A retainer is mounted on the tip of a plunger 
disposed in the pressure chamber to support the spring for 

closing the suction valve. Since a spring for closing a 
suction valve is supported by the retainer, the stroke of 

the plunger will not affect the load applied to the spring. 
Thus, the suction valve can be opened under a low pressure 

even if the spring force of the spring is weak. This will 
improve the response characteristic and the suction 

efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plunger pump used as a 
fluid pressure source for a fluid pressure control unit or 
the like. Fig. 2 shows one example of a conventional plunger 
pump used in a brake fluid pressure control unit for 
automobile. In the figure, numeral 1 designates a plunger having 
a suction passage 1a for a fluid. A plunger driving member 
2 comprises a driving shaft 2a provided with an eccentric 
cam 2b and a bearing 2c mounted on the cam 2b. The plunger 
pump further comprises a return spring 3, a holder 4, a 
plunger case 5, a suction valve 6, a discharge valve 7, a 
pressure chamber 8 provided between the plunger 1 and the 
holder 4 and the plunger case 5, a seal 9 for sealing the 
outer periphery of the plunger 1 between an annular groove 
1b on the outer periphery of the plunger, which serves as 
an inlet port of the suction passage 1a, and the pressure 
chamber 8, a seal 10 for sealing the outer periphery of the 
plunger 1 at its end open to the air, an end plug 11 
coupled to the rear end of the plunger case 5 with a seal 
on its outer periphery, and a plug screw 12 for securing 
the plunger case 5, the holder 4 and the end plug 11 to a 
unit housing 13.  The plunger 1 has one end disposed in the pressure 
chamber 8 and the other end open to the air and protruding 
out of the plunger case 5. It is pressed against the outer 
periphery of the bearing 2c by the return spring 3. In 
this plunger pump, the driving shaft 2a is rotated to move 
or reciprocate the plunger 1 up and down, so that the fluid 
introduced from a suction port 14 is compressed in the 
pressure chamber 8 and discharged through a discharge port 
15. In such a conventional plunger pump, a valve body 6a 
of the suction valve 6 is pressed against a valve seat 6c 
formed at the tip of the plunger 6 by a spring 6b for 
closing the valve. In this structure, the spring 6b is compressed with 
the stroke of the plunger 1. When the plunger 1 is at its 
top dead point (where suction is started), the force of the 
spring 6b becomes maximum. Therefore, when sucking, the 
response of the suction valve (for opening it) is delayed, 
which unduly affects the suction efficiency. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
plunger pump having a suction valve reliably opened under a 
low pressure and having an improved suction efficiency. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a plunger pump comprising a pump body having a suction port 
and a discharge port, a plunger having one end disposed in  
 
a pressure

<CLAIMS>
A plunger pump comprising a pump body having a 
suction port and a discharge port, a plunger having one end 

disposed in a pressure chamber and the other end open to 
the air, said plunger being formed with a suction passage 

leading from said suction port to said pressure chamber, a 
suction valve having a valve body and a valve seat formed 

on the tip of said plunger where an outlet port of said 
suction passage is open, a return spring for said plunger, 

and a spring for closing said suction valve by pressing 
said valve body against said valve seat, said return 

spring, said valve body and said spring for closing said 
valve being provided in said pressure chamber, 

characterized in that a retainer is mounted on the tip of 
said plunger to support said spring for closing said 

suction valve. 
A plunger pump as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
retainer is in the form of a cylinder and serves as a guide 

for the inner periphery of said return spring, wherein one 
end of said retainer is concentrically fitted on a small-diameter 

portion formed on the tip of said plunger, and 
wherein a flange formed on said one end of said retainer is 

pressed against the end face of said plunger by said return 
 

spring. 
A plunger pump as claimed in claim 2 wherein a seal 
is provided for sealing the outer periphery of said plunger 

between an annular groove provided on the outer periphery 
of said plunger and said pressure chamber, and wherein said 

seal is held between a shoulder formed on a front portion 
of said plunger and said flange of said retainer.
