<DESCRIPTION>
A primary aspect of the present invention relates 
to an ultrasonic detector. Ultrasonic detector equipment for automatic milking 
devices is described in the European patent application 
232.568 from the same applicant. A problem in this known 
system is the obtaining of a detection field that is 
accurately determined with respect to height, while in the 
plane defined by the height the wides possible bundle has to 
be generated in order to be able to search for, find and/or 
approach a cow udder provided with a teat. An ultrasonic detector according to claim 1 has for 
its object to improve upon the known prior art. Further this 
ultrasonic detector solves the above problem. A further aspect of the present invent ion relates 
to a method for searching a moving object. Existing robot systems, such as published in EP-A-232568, 
EP-A-213660 and EP-A-209202, for seeking, finding 
and/or following a (moving) object forming part of a greater 
entity have been found to be incapable of meeting requirements 
in respect of reliability, speed and/or possibilities 
for error correction. This further aspect of the present invention has 
for its object to improve upon the above mentioned prior 
art. Further it is an object of the present invention to 
obviate the above mentioned drawbacks. By making use, as in accordance with the method of 
claim 13, of position and speed information, a more accurate 
determining of position is achieved and information is 
obtained related to the pattern of movement of the (moving) 
object; information concerning speed in the case of violent 
movements will also be available. With the method according to claim 14 information 
is obtained Concerning errors and/or other irregularities  
 
either in the measuring process or the control process or in 
the movements of the object. A further aspect of the present invention relates 
to an ultrasonic sensor unit. Ultrasonic sensor units are much used in industrial 
and agrarian environments as they are not very sensitive to 
dirt and are robust. Ultrasonic sensor units for use in agriculture are 
described in the European patent applications EP-A-0 213 660, 
EP-A-0 232 568 and EP-A-0 270 165. The above publications all describe sensors for use 
in automatic milking devices, and more specifically for seeking 
and following the udder and/or teat of a cow. The present invent ion relates to an ultrasonic 
sensor unit as according to claim 25. By moving the transducer relative to an ultrasonic 
mirror the area for scanning is varied, for

<CLAIMS>
Element for positioning an animal, comprising: 

one or more lying surface for retaining a paw of 
an animal; 
one or more inclined surfaces next to said lying 
surface. 
Positioning element according to claim 1, 
provided with inclined surfaces extending forwardly and 

sidewardly resp., such that the cow will not move her paw in 
those resp. directions. 
Positioning element according to claim 1 or 2, 
provided with bars at the backside.
