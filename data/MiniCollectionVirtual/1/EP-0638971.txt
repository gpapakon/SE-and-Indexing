<ABSTRACT>
An ignition coil, of the plug-top type 
with reduced lateral size, is intended for use in 

multi-valve engines. The coil comprises a core (2) 
made of sheet metal wound in an elongate shape on 

which the spools (4, 20) of the secondary and 
primary windings respectively are fitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
ignition coil, particularly for a multi-valve 
internal combustion engine provided with a static 
distribution ignition system. As is known in multi-valve engines, which 
today are increasingly more varied, for example of 
the type having four valves per cylinder, the 
space available on the cylinder head is becoming 
increasingly smaller. This is due to the presence 
of the greater number of valves per cylinder and 
the respective mechanisms for actuating the valves 
themselves. If it is desired to use single coils, one 
for each spark plug, mounted directly on the spark 
plug, of the type generally known as plug-top, the 
problem then arises of the lack of available space 
for the aforementioned spark plugs. An ignition coil, of the plug-top type, according to the 
prior art is disclosed, for instance, in US-A-4 514 712. The object of the present invention is to 
produce an ignition coil of reduced lateral size 
which enables the above disadvantage to be 
overcome satisfactorily although offering 
performance which is equal to or greater than the 
coils of the prior art.  
 According to the present invention, this 
object is achieved by virtue of an ignition coil 
having the characteristics given in the claims. Further advantages and characteristics 
will become clear from the following detailed 
description, given with reference to the appended 
drawings, provided by way of non-limiting example, 
in which: 
Figure 1 is a side view of the core of 
the coil according to the present invention; Figure 2 is an axial view of the core 
shown in Figure 1; Figure 3 is a schematic view, partially 
in section, of components of the coil according to 
the present invention, partially assembled; Figure 4 is a schematic view, in 
section, of a component of the coil according to 
the present invention; Figures 5 and 6 are two axial views of 
the component shown in Figure 4;  
 Figure 7 is a schematic view of 
components of the coil, as shown in Figure 3, not 
in section; Figure 8 is a schematic view, not in 
section, of the component shown in Figure 4; Figure 9 is a view in section of a 
further component of the coil according to the 
present invention; and Figure 10 is a view, in section, of the 
complete coil according to the present invention.  With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the 
coil according to the present invention comprises 
a core 2 made of ferromagnetic material and having 
a substantially linear development. The core 2 
is, for example, formed of a cylinder with a
