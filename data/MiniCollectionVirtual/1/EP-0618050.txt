<ABSTRACT>
The hand plane includes a planing tool (3) which lies open on the underside of the machine between an entry table plate (6) and an exit table plate (7), a drive motor arranged behind said planing tool, and a handle (12) having a shape which is elongate in the advancing direction, said handle extending on the upper side of the machine from a front attachment point (13) situated approximately in the region vertically above the planing tool (3), above a gripping interspace (15) making it possible for the hand to grip round it and of a length corresponding at least to a handbreadth, rearwards to a rear attachment point (14). The planing tool (3) has a smaller diameter than the drive motor and is contained in a flat region (17) of the machine casing (2), which is of lower height with respect to the housing region (18) containing the drive motor, bounds the gripping interspace (15) at the bottom and extends over a length substantially corresponding to the handle length, from a casing region (20) rising in front of the flat region (17) and forming the front attachment point (13), to the front side (21) of the motor casing region (18) rising behind the flat region (17) and forming the rear attachment point (14).

<CLAIMS>
Hand-operated planer (1) with a motor-driven planing tool (3) 
mounted in a flat section (17) of the machine housing (2) at 

right-angles to the feed direction (4), which is exposed for 
workpiece machining on the underside of the machine between a 

height-adjustable front feed platen (6) and a rear discharge 
platen (7) at a tangent to the circular path of the planing tool 

(3), with a drive motor (8) mounted behind the planing tool (3) 
and connected to the latter via a power transmission unit (9) 

contained in a side housing extension (23), and with a handle 
(12) elongated in the feed direction (4) and extending from a 

front attachment point (13) approximately in the area vertically 
above the planing tool (3) lying on a housing section (20) 

extending upwards in front of the flat section (17), above an 
intermediate grip area (15) which facilitates grasping by the 

hand with a length corresponding to at least a hand-width, 
bounded below by the flat section (17) extending over a length 

corresponding essentially to the length of the handle, rearwards 
to a rear attachment point (14), characterized in that the 

planing tool (3) has a smaller diameter than the drive motor (8), 
that the housing section (18) accommodating the drive motor (8) 

extends upwards behind and with reference to the flat section 
(17), that the rear attachment point (14) is formed by the front 

side (21) of the housing section (18) containing the drive motor, 
and that the housing flat section (17) has a height determined 

by the tool diameter, which is less than the height of the side 
housing extension (23). 
Hand-operated planer according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the feed platen (6) is located on the underside of the 

housing section (20) extending upwards in front of the flat 
section (17) and forming the front attachment point (13), and 

that this housing section (20) contains the adjustment device for 
vertical adjustment of the feed platen (6) and has on its front 

side an actuating element (knob 22) for the adjustment device.
