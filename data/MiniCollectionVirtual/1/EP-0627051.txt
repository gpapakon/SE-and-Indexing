<ABSTRACT>
The clutch mechanism comprised a hollow cover (1), provided at its external periphery with an annular skirt (3), at least one pressure plate (20) and a diaphragm (30) whose external periphery forms a Belleville washer (31), which bears at its outer periphery on a rocking support (6, 60, 61, 62) carried by the cover (1), and bears at its inner periphery on a boss (22) on the pressure plate (20) in order to urge the plate (20) in one direction in which it is spaced apart from the cover (1). The rocking support (6, 60, 61) is made of elastic material and carries, in one piece, a centring extension (7, 71) having a generally axial orientation and radially positioned between the inner periphery of the skirt (3) of the cover (1) and the outer periphery of the diaphragm (30). Application to motor vehicles.

A clutch mechanism, especially for a motor vehicle, of the 
kind comprising a hollow cover plate (1) having at its outer periphery 

an annular skirt (3), oriented generally axially, at least 
one pressure plate (20), which is coupled in rotation to the cover 

plate (1) through attachment means (47) which enable the said 
pressure plate (20) to be displaced axially with respect to the 

said cover plate (1), and, between the cover plate (1) and the 
pressure plate (20), a diaphragm (30) the outer periphery of which 

defines a Belleville ring (31), which, firstly, bears at its outer 
periphery on a deflection abutment (6, 60, 61, 62) carried by the 

cover plate, and secondly, bears at its inner periphery on a projecting 
element (21) of the pressure plate (20) so as to urge the 

said plate (20) in a direction in which it is displaced away from 
the cover plate (1), in which the deflection abutment (6, 60, 61) 

carries an integral centring extension (7, 71), oriented generally 
axially and interposed radially between the inner periphery of the 

skirt (3) of the cover plate (1) and the outer periphery of the 
diaphragm (30), characterised in that the deflection abutment (6, 

60, 61) with its integral extension (7, 71) are of heat resistant 
elastic material and in that the said extension (7, 71) is mounted 

under precompression between the skirt (3) of the cover plate (1) 
and the Belleville ring (31) of the diaphragm (30). 
A mechanism according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the deflection abutment (6, 60, 61, 62) with its centring extension 

(7, 71) is of an elastic material capable of being reticulated, 
and is formed by deposition on a deposit surface associated 

with the cover plate (1) and/or with the diaphragm (30).  
 
A mechanism according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the cover 
plate includes a base (2), characterised in that the deflection 

abutment (6) comprises an annular band in the form of a ring 
mounted in a complementary toroidal seating element (5) defining 

the junction zone of the skirt (3) with the base (2) of the cover 
plate. 
A mechanism according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the deflection abutment (6) is mounted by nesting in its toroidal 

seating element (5). 
A mechanism according to Claim 1 of 2, in which the cover 
plate has a base (2), characterised in that the deflection abutment 

(60, 61, 62) with its integral extension (7, 71) hugs the 
form of a rounded portion (23) of the cover plate which joins the 

skirt (3) of the latter to its base (22) and in that the said deflection 
abutment has an oblong shape. 
A mechanism according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the extension (7) is provided at its free end with 

a transverse flange (8) directed towards the axis of the assembly, 
in such a way that the deflection abutment (6, 60, 61) with its 

integral extension (7, 71) caps the Belleville ring (31) of the 
diaphragm (30). 
A mechanism according to claim 6, characterised in that 

the said flange (8) is extended inwardly so as to define inclined 
ventilating fins directed towards the pressure plate (20). 
A mechanism according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the skirt (3) of the cover plate (1) is provided 

with ventilating apertures for evacuating heat. 
A mechanism according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that the cover plate (1) is made of fibre reinforced 

synthetic material.
