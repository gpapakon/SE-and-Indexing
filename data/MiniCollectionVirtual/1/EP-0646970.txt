<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device has a structure in which 
doped layers and undoped layers are alternately stacked 

and is constituted by (a) a semi-insulating substrate (100), 
(b) undoped layers (110,130) consisting of a substantially undoped 

diamond material, and (c) thin doped layers (120) formed 
between the undoped layers and consisting of a diamond 

material doped with B as an impurity. Stable operation 
characteristics can be obtained within a temperature 

range from room temperature to a high temperature while a 
semiconductor material having a deep impurity level is 

used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device mainly consisting of a semiconductor material
having a deep impurity level and, more particularly, to a
semiconductor device which has a deep impurity level and
stably operates within a wide temperature range from room
temperature to a high temperature.Conventionally, Si, GaAs, and the like are mainly
used as materials constituting semiconductor devices. In
recent years, however, materials (to be referred to as
wide bandgap materials hereinafter) having larger
bandgaps than those of the conventional materials have
received a great deal of attention as promising materials
for realizing a semiconductor device having high
performance and an excellent environmental tolerance, and
extensive studies have been made for actual utilization.
There are, e.g., ZnSe used for a blue light-emitting
device, SiC and diamond capable of realizing a
heat-resistant device, and the like.However, a donor level and an acceptor level (to be
generically referred to as an impurity level hereinafter)
of these materials are largely apart from a conduction 
band and a valence band toward a forbidden band side (this
distance will be referred to as a depth hereinafter),
respectively. For this reason, it is difficult to
manufacture devices such as transistors which effectively
use the advantage of a wide bandgap material, and studies
and experiments have been currently continued. For
example, an experiment for a diamond semiconductor having
a large bandgap value of 5.5 eV is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 4-280622.A carrier concentration in a semiconductor doped
with an impurity (dopant) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/kT)
or exp(-ΔE/2kT) where ΔE represents the depth of the
impurity level. When B as a p-type impurity is doped in
Si, the depth of the impurity level is 0.045 eV. When P,
As, or Sb as an n-type impurity is doped in Si, the depth
of the impurity level is 0.045 eV, 0.049 eV, or 0.039 eV.
The value of kT is about 0.025 eV at room temperature (300
K) or about 0.050 eV at 600 K. Therefore, a change of
carrier concentration within this temperature range do
not exceed 10 times.However, when a semiconductor having a large bandgap
is doped with an impurity, the impurity level is deep,
i.e., the value of ΔE is large, so the dependency of the
carrier concentration on temperature becomes large. If
ΔE = 0.37 eV, the change of the carrier concentration
reaches 1,000 times at the change of a temperature of 300 
K to 600 K. Therefore, the electrical operation
characteristics
