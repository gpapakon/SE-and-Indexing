<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for dispensing a tape-like material in portions, in particular bandaging or adhesive plaster, with an arrangement for advancing the tape-like material from a tape-holding arrangement, with a tape-cutting arrangement which can be deflected, and with a clamping arrangement which essentially fixes the tape-like material upon deflection of the tape-cutting arrangement. According to the invention, the device has at least one further means (62, 90, 16') for preventing unwanted transport or unwanted movement of the tape-like material. The blade (13) of the tape-cutting arrangement (62) can, in one embodiment of the invention, lie in a notch (65) of the key (6) when deflected. Activation of the advancing arrangement (60) is thus prevented during cutting. The tape slot (54) can also be narrowed by means of a cam (55), a spring element (57) or a bead in such a way that the tape material is prevented from falling back when the advancing arrangement is activated. By providing the clamping arrangement (62) with surface structuring (91), such as teeth (16'), it is also possible to prevent the tape material from slipping during cutting. The means which have been described above can be used individually or in combination.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for dispensing ribbon-like material (30), in 
particular adhesive plaster, having a device (60) for advancing 

the ribbon-like material from a ribbon receptacle (1), a 
displaceable ribbon-cutting device (61) and a clamping device 

(62), which substantially fixes the ribbon-like material upon 
displacement of the ribbon-cutting device (61), characterised in 

that at least one further means (62, 90, 16') is provided for 
preventing undesired transport or undesired movement of the 

ribbon-like material. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
means is formed by the ribbon-cutting device (62) [sic]
, which, 
upon displacement, lies with a part (13) in the movement path (D) 

of a part of the advancing device and prevents the actuation of 
the advancing device (60) of a part (6). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
means is formed by a slot-narrowing means (90), which narrows a 

ribbon slot (54) between the ribbon receptacle (1) and the 
advancing device (60) in such a way that it prevents undesired 

ribbon movement counter to the ribbon-advancing direction (B). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
means is formed by surface structuring (91) on that side of the 

clamping device (62) which faces the ribbon-like material (30) 
and the surface structuring (91) prevents undesired slipping of 

the ribbon-like material (30) as it is being cut. 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
advancing device (60) has a push-button (6) with an opening (6'), 

in that a part (13) of the displaced ribbon-cutting device passes 
through the opening (6') of the push-button (6) in such a way 

that the part (13) passing through the opening (61) [sic] lies 

in the movement path (D) of the push-button (6).  
 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
cutter (13) of the ribbon-cutting device (61) comes to rest in 

the opening (6'), constructed as a notch, of the push-button (6) 
when the ribbon-cutting device (61) assumes its position of 

maximum displacement. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
slot-narrowing means (90) is formed by a lug (55) and/or by a 

spring element (57) and/or by a bulge, and in that the slot-narrowing 
means (90) has an edge (71) which is oriented at an 

angle (α) of about 75 to 170°, preferably 90°, counter to the 
ribbon-advancing direction (B). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
surface structuring (91) of the clamping device (62) is formed 

by teeth (16') which lie at the upper edge of the clamping device 
(62) on the side facing the ribbon-like material (30). 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
teeth (16') are oriented parallel to the ribbon-advancing 

direction (B) and, upon deflection of the ribbon-cutting device 
(61), prevent a slipping movement of the ribbon-like material in 

the displacement direction (11) of the ribbon-cutting device. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the apparatus has first and second slots 

(63, 64) in the region of the push-button (6), and in that the 
push-button has projections (64) [sic]
 which pass through the 
slots (63, 64). 
Apparatus according to Claim 10, characterised in that the 
angle between the first and second slot is about 90°. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the ribbon-cutting device (61) has a cutter 

(13) which is received by a holder, and the cutter (13) has at 
least one opening (44), through which an engaging means (43) is  

 
able to pass, and the engaging means (43) is formed on a 

fastening means (42) capable of being pushed into the holder. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a cover (80) which can be moved away and serves 

to protect the dispensing opening (4).
