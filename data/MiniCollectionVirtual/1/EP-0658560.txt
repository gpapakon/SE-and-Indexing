<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process for removing an 
oxygen-containing component in a crude organometallic compound 

consisting essentially of an organometallic compound of the general 
formula (1):



R₁R₂MX   (1)



 
wherein R₁ and R₂ independently represent an alkyl group or a 

cycloalkadienyl group, M represents a Ga atom or an In atom and X 
represents an alkyl group, a halogen atom or a hydrogen atom, 

and an oxygen-containing component as an impurity,
 

which comprises the steps of mixing the crude organometallic 
compound and an alkali halide in an amount of 0.1 to 10 % by weight of 

the crude organometallic compound, heat-treating the mixture, and 
vaporizing the organometallic compound for separation, the steps 

being carried out in a substantially oxygen-free atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for purifying an
organometallic compound. More particularly, it relates to a process
for removing a trace amount of oxygen-containing component
contained in an organometallic compound which is used as a raw
material in the field of compound semiconductors.Organometallic compounds are recently used as raw
materials for forming a thin film of a compound semiconductor by
metal organic chemical vapor deposition (referred to as "MOCVD"
hereinafter).The thin film is not only utilized as a light-emitting diode, a
laser diode and a microwave element but also is starting to be utilized
as an ultraspeed IC and a opto-electronic IC.However, organometallic compounds contain an oxygen-containing
component as an impurity, which is formed by the reaction
of the organometallic compound with air or moisture inevitably mixed
during preparation or handling processes of the organometallic
compound.When the organometallic compound containing such the
oxygen-containing component as an impurity is subjected to the above 
MOCVD, oxygen atoms are incorporated in the thin layer of the
semiconductor. As the result, its electric and optical characteristics
are extremely deteriorated to cause problems, for example, that only a
film having high resistivity or low luminescent efficiency is obtained,
or that elements using the thin layer have a short life even if a film
having satisfactory properties could be obtained.A fractional distillation method usually adopted for removing
an impurity, i.e. an oxygen-containing component, cannot reduce its
content in the organometallic compound to below hundreds of ppm
since the vapor pressure of the oxygen-containing component is
similar to that of the organometallic compound.JP-A-2-67230 (1990) proposes a process
for purifying an organometallic compound containing an oxygen-containing
component in which it is treated with a hydrogenated metal
compound such as sodium hydride, lithium aluminum hydride, etc. in an
amount of 0.1 to 50 % by weight, based on the organometallic
compound.JP-A-3-112991 (1991) proposes a process
for purifying an alkyl aluminum containing an oxygen-containing
component in which it is treated with an aluminum halide such as
aluminum bromide, aluminum iodide, etc.However, since the hydrogenated metal compound or the
aluminum halide mentioned above itself has a high decomposition
tendency by moisture, these processes have problems, for example,
that their dealing should be strictly controlled for maintenance or 
control of the
