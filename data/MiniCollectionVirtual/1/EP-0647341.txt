<ABSTRACT>
System for use of a microprocessor for drawing of winners in a lottery with an in advance given dividend, at which each lottery ticket includes at least one counter of bingo type with a number in rows and columns provided numbers as well as for the lottery ticket unique identification. The identification of each lottery ticket and number row of a counter are stored in a first register which is readable by a microprocessor, that a number of number sequences are created and stored in a second register which is readable by a microprocessor, in such a way that each of the number sequences is unique and gives a number of prize-winning rows of numbers among the counters, which number corresponds to the given dividend. One of the number sequences in the second register is selected by a random draw. The microprocessor compares this chosen number sequence with the number rows in the first register and shows the identifications that indicate counters with a prize-winning row of numbers.

<DESCRIPTION>
At conventional lotteries one simply draws prize tickets 
from the total number of lottery tickets, until an in 
advance given number of prize tickets has been obtained. 
The results of such draws are published by means of lottery 
prize-list. A disadvantage of usual lotteries is that the 
excitement moment is short-lived. Interactive games of bingo type engages the participants 
considerably more and are therefore experienced as more 
exciting. A problem at games of bingo type is that the 
random draw of numbers gives an unpredictable dividend. It 
is true, that the dividend in long-term can be statistically 
calculated, but the uncertainty is yet very big 
before each individual draw. US-A-4 909 516 discloses an interactive bingo game system 
in which the memory of a computer is used for storing all 
number sequences of the bingo counters. However, this prior 
art system comprises a standard bingo ball popper which 
involves a random draw of numbers leading to an 
unpredictable dividend. The purpose of the invention is therefore to achieve a 
system that makes it possible to achieve an in advance 
given dividend at games of bingo type. For this object the invention concerns a method for drawing 
winners in a lottery with a predetermined dividend wherein 
printed bingo type lottery tickets are each provided with 
a unique identification number and a unique counter  
 
comprising a quantity of different numbers arranged in rows 
and columns, the identification number and the number rows 
of each lottery ticket are stored in a first register 
readable by a microprocessor, a plurality of number 
sequences is created by means of a computer in such a way 
that each of the number sequences is unique and gives a 
number of prizewinning number rows among the counters, 
which number corresponds to the predetermined dividend, 
said plurality of number sequences is stored in a second 
register which is readable by the microprocessor, one 
number sequence is selected by a random draw among said 
number sequences stored in the second register, the 
selected number sequence is compared by the microprocessor 
to the number rows stored in the first register, the number 
rows whose numbers are comprised in the selected number 
sequence are sorted out by the microprocessor, 
the identification numbers of the tickets with the 
selected winning number rows are put together, and the 
selected number sequence is presented. Advantageous variants of the invention are illustrated by 
the subsequent subclaims. The system

<CLAIMS>
A method for drawing winners in a lottery with a 
predetermined dividend wherein 


(a) printed bingo type lottery tickets are each 
provided with a unique identification number and a 

unique counter comprising a quantity of different 
numbers arranged in rows and columns 
(b) the identification number and the number rows of 
each lottery ticket are stored in a first register 

readable by a microprocessor 
(c) a plurality of number sequences is created by means 
of a computer in such a way that each of the number 

sequences is unique and gives a number of 
prizewinning number rows among the counters, which 

number corresponds to the predetermined dividend 
(d) said plurality of number sequences is stored in a 
second register which is readable by the 

microprocessor 
(e) one number sequence is selected by a random draw 
among said number sequences stored in the second 

register 
(f) the selected number sequence is compared by the 
microprocessor to the number rows stored in the 

first register 
(g) the number rows whose numbers are comprised in the 
selected number sequence are sorted out by the 

microprocessor, and the identification numbers of the tickets with the selected winning number rows are put together 
(h) the selected number sequence is presented. 
A method according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the numbers in the 
selected number sequence are presented one by one in a 

bingo-manner.  
 
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in, that the first register 
contains all possible different number rows. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that the first register 
contains a selected quantity of number rows. 
A method according to any of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized
 in that the second register 
comprises at least so many number sequences, that the 

number sequences form a statistical distribution amount in 
relation to the quantity of number rows. 
A method according to any of preceding claims,
characterized
 in that each number sequence is 
created with consideration to the quantity of number rows, 

to the number of winners in the predetermined dividend and 
to how long the number sequence must be to indicate winning 

number rows. 
A method according to claim 6, wherein the ticket 
includes the numbers 1-75, arranged in five columns,
characterized
 in that each number sequence is 
created by means of the internal random number generator of 

a computer, wherein a number of lists of random numbers are 
generated to correspond to the number columns in the 

ticket, with random mutual order of the numbers 1-15 in the 
first list, 16-30 in the second list, 31-45 in the third 

the list, 46-60 in the fourth list and 61-75 in the fifth 
list, that a random number between one and five is 

generated, which number determines in which list of random 
numbers the next number shall be drawn, that one to five 

numbers are drawn in each of the lists of random numbers by 
means of a new random number between 1-15 for each draw, 

which random number points onto a position in the current  
 

list of random numbers, so that this position contains the 
number that shall be used in the number sequence.
