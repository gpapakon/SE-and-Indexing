<ABSTRACT>
The control unit has a screen (3), which is flanked on both sides by function-key arrays (4a, 4b) for controlling the functional sequence of the machine. A keyboard (5) serving for data input into the processor of the control unit is arranged on a hinged flap (50). The latter is mounted about a horizontal axis (53) underneath the screen (3) in such a way that, in the unused state of the keyboard, it is swung over onto the screen and protectively covers the latter, at least in the lower region. A second hinged flap (6) is hinge-mounted in the upper region of the control unit above the screen (3) and can be swung down for protecting the upper region of the screen. In addition, the second protective flap (6) can be used as a glare guard for partially shading the screen against undesirably dazzling light.

Control unit (1) for an injection moulding machine including a
keyboard (5) for data input, functional key sets (4a, 4b) for controlling the

operating sequence of the machine and including a display screen (3);

   whereby the keyboard (5) is secured to a flap (50), which is pivotally
mounted in the region below the display screen (3), and may be swung, in the

unused state, towards the display screen (3) such that the flap (50) and/or
keyboard (5) protectively covers at least the lower region of the display screen

(3); and

   whereby on at least one side of the display screen (3) a functional key
pad (4a, 4b) is so arranged in fixed association with the display screen that the

functional keys (40) are freely accessible and operable, even when the display
screen (3) is covered.
Control unit as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that a second
protective flap (6) is pivotally arranged in the upper region of the display screen

(3), the pivotal axes (53, 60) of the two flaps (50, 6) extending parallel to one
another, and that the two flaps substantially completely cover the display screen,

when they are in the position in which they are swung towards the display
screen (3) (Fig. 3).
Control unit as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that the
second flap (6) is adjustable into different pivotal positions such that it is usable

as an antiglare flap when operating the display screen (3). 
Control unit as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the two functional key pads (4a, 4b) are symmetrically arranged on the two

sides of the display screen (3).
Control unit as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that each functional key pad (4a, 4b) projects forwardly towards the front side

beyond the first and/or second flap (50, 6), when swung in.
