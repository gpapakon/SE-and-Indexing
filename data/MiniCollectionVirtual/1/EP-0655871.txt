<ABSTRACT>
A communication system (10) includes a population of 
mobile units (24) which communicate with a control station 

(29). Communications take place between the control station 
(29) and the mobile units (24) so that the system (10) may 

gain knowledge about the mobile units' locations. The mobile 
units (24) occasionally initiate such communications 

automatically. The control station (29) sends data defining a 
target area (72, FIG. 5) to the mobile units. The mobile units 

(24) reside in the target areas (72) when the target areas (72) 
are first assigned, but the mobile units (24) are free to move. 

The control station (29) transmits broadcast signals to 
geographically spaced apart cells (36, FIG. 2). The broadcast 

signals convey current data identifying the service areas 
covered by the cells (36). The mobile units (24) automatically 

initiate communications when their assigned target areas (72) 
do not coincide with the service areas for the broadcast 

signals they can receive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
communication systems and, more specifically, to
communication systems in which communication
automatically takes place between a control station and
members of a population of mobile units from time to time.Communication systems, such as cellular radio
telecommunication systems and others, may include system-related
components and populations of mobile units. The
mobile units may freely move throughout the regions covered
by the communication systems. The system components
include base units, repeaters, control stations, switching
offices, and the like, and they are controlled by operators and
providers of the communication systems. Members of the
populations of mobile units may communicate with each other
and perhaps with equipment coupled to the public switched
telecommunications networks through the system components.
The mobile units are typically controlled by customers or end
users of the communication systems.A communication system may benefit from occasional
system-related communications taking place between system
components and mobile units. System-related communication
takes place to insure the reliable and efficient operation of
the system. System-related communication is not intended to
relay information to end users. Rather, system-related
communication needs to take place between mobile units and
system components so that the system can gain useful
information, such as locations for mobile units and the like.Mobile unit location knowledge can be beneficial for 
several reasons. If a system knows where a particular mobile
unit is located, then the system can route calls for that mobile
unit to only that location and conserve system capacity in
other locations. This dramatically decreases the consumption
of system resources and permits a communication system to
handle many more calls than could be handled if calls were
routed to all locations where a particular mobile unit might
possibly reside. Furthermore, knowledge of mobile unit
locations is important, since in some geopolitical
jurisdictions communication operations may be prohibited by
the lack of proper licensing arrangements. Moreover, rates
charged to customers may vary depending upon the locations of
mobile units when calls are made.While system knowledge of mobile unit locations may be
particularly beneficial, other types of system-related
communications may also be valuable. For example, system
reliability and operational efficiency may benefit from
occasional system-related
