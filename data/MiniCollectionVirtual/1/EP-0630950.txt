<ABSTRACT>
The improved white conductive powder comprises 
white inorganic pigment particles the surfaces of which 

are coated with an electrically conductive layer of a dual 
structure consisting of a lower tin dioxide sub-layer and 

an upper tin dioxide-containing indium oxide sub-layer. 
To produce the powder, the hydration product of tin is 

deposited uniformly on the surfaces of white inorganic 
particles and, subsequently, an overcoat of indium oxide 

hydrate containing 0.1 - 20 wt% of tin dioxide is formed, 
followed by a heat treatment that is conducted at 350 - 

750°C in a non-oxidizing atmosphere. 
A resin composition containing this powder retains 
both the good conduction properties of a white conductive 

resin composition incorporating a conductive powder the 
particles of which are coated with antimony-doped tin 

dioxide and the high photostability of a white conductive 
resin composition incorporating an aluminum-doped 

conductive zinc oxide powder and yet the composition has 
a much higher degree of whiteness than either prior art 

resin composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to white conductive powders
for use in electrically conductive or antistatic synthetic
fibers, as well as in plastics and paints protected against
static buildup. The invention also relates to a process
for producing such white conductive powders, as well as
resin compositions containing them.Many of the currently used conductive or antistatic
synthetic fibers, plastics and paints are formulated with
carbon black, metal powders, etc. However, the black color
of these constituent materials has limited the use of the
final products. With a view to solving this problem,
there have been proposed white conductive powders that
comprise particles of titanium dioxide, etc. coated
with an antimony-doped tin oxide layer (see, Japanese
Patent Public Disclosure (KOKAI) Nos. Sho 53-92854,
58-209002, etc.), as well as synthetic fibers, plastics
and paints that are formulated with such white conductive
powders (see, Japanese Patent Public Disclosure (KOKAI)
Nos. Sho 56-169816, Hei 2-307911, etc.)The synthetic fibers, plastics and paints that
have the proposed white conductive powders added thereto
have a much higher degree of whiteness than those
formulated with carbon black, metal powders and other
conventional materials. Yet, compared to the case of
formulating titanium dioxide which is one of the most
commonly used white pigments, the color of those synthetic
fibers, plastics and paints is bluish black and still
low in whiteness. As a further problem, the color of the
antimony-doped tin dioxide changes to bluish black upon
exposure to light, causing color shading in the surfaces
of resins and paints that incorporate said antimony-doped
tin dioxide.Powders that are free from the problem of
discoloration under light can be prepared by doping zinc 
oxide with aluminum (the product is called "conductive
zinc oxide"). Resins and paints that are formulated with
this conductive zinc oxide are preferable in that they
experience only limited discoloration under light; on the
other hand, they are inferior in conduction characteristics
compared to conductive powders such as those of TiO2 coated
with antimony-doped tin dioxide; for example, their volume
resistivity is about a hundred times as high as the value
of "conductive titanium dioxide" powder. In addition,
they have not been completely satisfactory in terms of
whiteness.Further, the toxicity of antimony is much discussed
today and the use of antimony-free white conductive powders
is of great demand.Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. Hei
