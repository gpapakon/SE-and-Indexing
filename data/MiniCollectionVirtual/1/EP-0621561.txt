<ABSTRACT>
A continuous, flexible ticket strip for use with a 
ticket dispenser (10) is disclosed, which ticket strip 

is provided at regular intervals with pairs of cuts 
(44a,44b), and which cuts define generally tongue-shaped 

flaps (45) and flap openings (46). The tickets 
are joined by shoulders (48,49) and bridges (50), the 

bridges (50) preventing the flaps (46) protruding from 
the plane of the ticket strip and becoming caught in 

the ticket dispenser (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexible strip 
of tickets for use in a ticket feeder. The ticket 
feeder functions to enable tickets to be torn 
individually from the ticket strip and comprises a 
casing in which the ticket roll is housed, at least one 
cover part which is connected pivotally to the casing, 
and a guide path which is operative to guide a length 
of continuous strip of tickets taken from the ticket 
roll. The free end of the continuous strip projects 
through an outfeed opening in the ticket feeder and 
serves as a fingergrip by means of which the strip can 
be pulled from the roll. Means are also provided 
which, as the free end of the strip is pulled, function 
to mutually separate parts of strip material which are 
located between two mutually adjacent tickets and which 
hold said tickets together. The continuous strip has 
punched at regular intervals therealong parting lines 
which define a plurality of tongue-shaped flaps and 
"flap apertures" and those material parts which hold 
two mutually adjacent tickets together are located at 
the ends of respective parting lines and extend 
approximately transversely to the longitudinal axis of 
the strip. An assembly comprising a ticket feeder and a 
continuous ticket strip of this kind, for instance 
queue tickets, is known from each of US Patent 
specifications 4,047,652 and 3,885,724. The ticket 
roll used with these known assembles comprises a 
flexible, continuous ticket strip in which respective 
tickets have punched therein penetrating tongue-shaped 
flaps which when a ticket located in the outfeed 
aperture is pulled manually, are brought into contact 
with guide means, through the medium of a feed path. 
The guide means functions to guide a tongue-shaped flap  
 
in one direction and the remainder of the strip in 
another direction. In order that an individual ticket 
can be torn from the strip, it is necessary to provide 
tear edges against which those parts of the freely 
protruding ticket are connected to the immediately 
following ticket can be brought into contact, thereby 
to separate a ticket from the strip. One drawback with 
this known assembly is that the continuous ticket strip 
used therewith can impair the function of the ticket 
feeder. For instance, the known ticket strip has 
through "punched" flaps. These flaps are liable to 
project from the plane of the remainder of the strip, 
to a greater or lesser extent, and will often fold or 
buckle before arriving at the outfeed opening of the 
ticket feeder. When the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A continuous, flexible ticket strip for use 
with a ticket dispenser, which ticket strip is in roll 

form and is provided at regular intervals with pairs of 
cuts (44a,44b), the cuts which form each pair being 

disposed on either side of a line coincident with or 
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ticket strip, 

and which cuts have first and second ends, the first 
ends being forward of the second ends in the feed 

direction of the ticket strip, wherein 
the second ends of each pair of cuts 

(44a,44b) are disposed relatively far apart and 
generally opposite each other on either side of said 

line, thereby defining shoulders (48,49) between said 
second ends and the edges of the ticket strip, 

such that consecutive tickets are connected to each other 
by said shoulders (48,49), 

characterised in that 

the first ends of each pair of cuts (44a,44b) 
are disposed relatively close together and generally 

opposite each other on either side of said line, 
thereby defining bridges (50) across the line, 
such that consecutive tickets are also connected to 
each other by said bridges 

(50). 
A ticket strip as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the cuts (44a,44b) are symmetrically disposed about 

said line. 
A ticket strip as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the first ends of the cuts (44a,44b) extend in 

a direction substantially transverse to the feed 
direction of the ticket strip. 
A ticket strip as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein the cuts (44a,44b) define tongue-shaped flaps 

(45) and corresponding flap openings (46). 
A ticket strip as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the shoulders (48,49) are provided with 

weakening perforations or tear lines.
