<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a machine for binding sheets together with plastic strips. The machine compresses two strips, one strip (21) having studs extending therefrom and another strip (24) having holes corresponding to the studs, towards each other, then cuts off the ends of each stud and forms rivet heads thereon to bind the sheets together. The improvement over such machines uses a motor (201) to drive linkages previously manually actuated. The binding motor (201) drives linkages (81, 67 and 221, 232) on either side of the machine which causes a transverse pressure bar (61) to apply a pre-selected force on the strips, then to initiate movement of a knife (122) which cuts off the studs and form heads thereon and finally release the compressive force. A second motor (216) drives a linkage (218, 219, 221) which returns the pressure bar to its upward position as the binding cycle is completed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new and improved book binding
machine of the type using a pair of plastic binding strips,
the first strip having studs spaced along the length of the
strip and the other strip having holes spaced complementary
to the studs. The second strip is installed in the machine,
punched sheets are aligned with the second strip, the studs
of the first strip are inserted through holes in the sheets
and in the second strip and the machine then compresses the
strips toward each other, cuts off excess stud length and
forms rivet heads on the studs to bind the book together.
Thus the present invention comprises an improvement over U.S.
Patent Nos. 3,994,035 and 4,068,997 which employ many of the
mechanical elements of the present invention.Although U.S. Patent Nos. 3,994,035 and 4,068,997 were
manually operated machines, nevertheless motor driven machines
are shown in such prior patents as 4,270,970, and 3,811,146.
However, the mechanisms used in accordance with the present
invention are considerably simpler and less expensive than
those heretofore used with motorized binding machines.Means for returning a pressure bar to its upward position
at the end of a binding cycle are shown in U.S. Patent No.
4,270,970. The present invention employs a different
mechanism for such return which is energized by a separate
motor. The present machine is a development of U.S. Patent No.
3,994,035. Details of the mechanisms common to the present
machine and the aforesaid patents are readily apparent. At
the commencement of a cycle of operation of the present
machine, the operator inserts the binding strips and sheets
and manually positions a pressure bar on top of the uppermost
of the plastic binding strips. Closing a switch initiates
one cycle of operation of the binding motor. As in the prior
machines, a punching mechanism is installed. Such a punching
mechanism may be used in the present invention. Details
thereof are substantially the same as that shown in the prior
patents. The important distinction over the prior patents
is that the punching mechanism is driven by a crank turned
by the shaft of the binding motor.In the binding mode of the machine, if the pressure bar
has been removed from its upward or retracted position,
energization of the binding motor accomplishes the binding
operation by means of an interlock.Rotation of the binding motor causes oscillation of
cranks which cause generally longitudinal rearward movement
of actuators on either side of the machine. The actuators
perform several
