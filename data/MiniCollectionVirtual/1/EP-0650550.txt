<ABSTRACT>
A camshaft and method of manufacturing thereof wherein the camshaft has a plurality of thick wall sections (16) and a plurality of thin wall sections (18). Axially spaced cams (10) are mounted on a hollow tube (13) about the thick wall sections (16). The thick wall sections (16) are deformed outward to mechanically secure the cams to the hollow tube. The outer diameter of the hollow tube thin wall sections (18) are not deformed when the thick wall sections (16) are deformed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to camshafts for 
reciprocating piston engines and more particularly to 
camshafts and a method of making a camshaft where the 
cams and shaft are produced as individual elements and 
are fastened together forming the camshaft. One method of manufacturing camshafts involves 
forming the cams separately by methods such as powdered 
metallurgy. The cams are then fastened to a hollow tube 
using known fastening processes, such as welding, brazing 
or expansion of the hollow tube. Bearing or journal 
surfaces are machined onto the hollow tube between cams. 
Another method of attaching the cams, described in 
US-A-4 858 295, leaves a plurality of projections on the 
outside of the hollow tube between cams. These 
projections must be removed in order to form the journal 
surfaces. The displacement of material caused by an expander 
tool during expansion of the hollow tube induces work 
hardening and stress into the tube. Limiting work 
hardening reduces the risk of failure due to tube 
splitting. EP-A-324 499 dicloses a method of making a camshaft 
according to the preamble of claim 1. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a method of making a camshaft 
comprising the steps of providing a hollow tube; forming 
a plurality of reduced diameter zones on the hollow tube; 
providing a plurality of cam elements, each cam element 
including an axial opening; inserting the hollow tube  
 
into the cam elements, each cam element being positioned 
about a reduced diameter zone; and expanding the reduced 
diameter zones of the hollow tube into mechanical 
interference engagement with the cam elements, 
characterised in that the reduced diameter zones are 
formed by pressing a plurality of spaced apart portions 
of the hollow tube and machining the outer surface of the 
hollow tube, the reduced diameter zones thereby forming 
thicker wall zones. According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a camshaft of the type 
having a hollow tube, a plurality of spaced first 
portions and a plurality of spaced second portions, a 
first portion being adjacent to a second portion, the 
tube wall thickness of each first portion being thicker 
than the tube wall thickness of an adjacent portion, and 
a plurality of axially spaced cams mounted about the 
hollow tube, each cam having an axial opening and being 
positioned about a first portion characterised in that 
each first portion is formed by pressing a portion of the 
hollow tube to reduce its
