<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a communication system with a communication network (1) connected to at least one terminal device (2). The communication network (1) is coupled with a service device (3) which comprises a switching device (6), a control arrangement (7) and a database (8) containing at least one service logic program. A terminal device (2) is provided to activate a first and second parameter transmitted to the service device (3). The control arrangement (7) is intended to retrieve a service logic program from the database (8) depending on the first parameter and to control the switching device (6) depending on the second parameter and the retrieved service logic program.

<CLAIMS>
A communication system comprising a communications network (1)
coupled at least to a terminal unit (2), 
characterized in that
 the communications network ( 1 )
is coupled to a service device (3) which comprises a switching centre (6), a controller (7)

and a data bank (8) which contains at least a service logical program, 
in that
 a terminal unit
(2) is provided for generating a first and a second parameter sent to the service device (3),

and 
in that
 the controller (7) is provided for extracting a service logical program from the
data bank (8) in response to the first parameter and for controlling the switching centre (6)

in response to the second parameter and the called service logical program.
A communication system as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
controller (7) is provided for extracting the service logical program addressed by a first

parameter for interpreting the service logical program and for generating a control
instruction for the switching centre (6) in response to the second parameter and 
in that
 the
switching centre (6) is used for conveying the received first and second parameters to the

controller (7) and, in response to a control instruction, for carrying out a switching function.
A communication system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

the service device (3) contains a service development arrangement (9) which is provided for
developing a service logical program and for feeding the service logical programs to the

data bank (8).
A communication system as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that

the service device (3) comprises a speech processor (10) which

receives a control instruction from the controller (7) at least in response to the
second parameter,
is provided for speech recognition of a message supplied 
via
 the switching centre
(6),
is provided for conveying the recognized message as a third parameter to the
controller (7), and
is provided for producing a prompt conveyed by the switching centre (6).
A communication system as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the
controller (7) is provided for receiving the third parameter from the speech processor (10)

and for producing a control instruction for the switching centre (6) and/or for the speech
processor (10) in dependence on the third parameter.
A service device (3) coupled 
via
 a communications network (1) to at least a
terminal unit (2) and which comprises a switching center (6), a data bank (8) containing at

least a service logical program and a controller (7), which controller is arranged for
extracting a service logical program from the data bank (8) in response to a first parameter

sent by a terminal unit (2) and for controlling the switching center (6) in response to a
second parameter sent by the terminal unit (2) and in response to the called service logical

program.
