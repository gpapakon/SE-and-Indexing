<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
reducing the cholesterol content of a milk product by 
extraction with an edible oil. Physicians and health experts generally agree 
that a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol can 
reduce the likelihood of heart and circulatory diseases. 
Consumer awareness of the health benefits associated with 
maintaining a diet low in fat and cholesterol has 
recently increased, along with the demand for food 
products low in these components. Because of its low fat 
content, skim milk currently has large applications in 
such lowfat food products. Whole milk is a dilute emulsion combined with a 
colloidal dispersion in which the continuous phase is a 
solution. Whole milk has a fat content typically between 
about 3.3% to about 3.4% and 14 mg cholesterol per 100 g 
milk. To obtain skim milk, whole milk is centrifuged at 
a low speed. An oil rich phase having cream floating on 
top, and a liquid phase or skim milk is obtained. In milk products, the majority of the fat and 
about 80 percent to about 85 percent of the total 
cholesterol is present in the cream. The cream is 
comprised of predominantly milk fat globules. The 
cholesterol in the milk fat is thought to be distributed 
between the milk fat globule membrane and the bulk lipid. 
Wong, Fundamentals of Dairy Chemistry (1988). When the membrane 
is separated from the milk fat globules and the butter 
oil is isolated from the milk fat globules, about 90 
percent or greater of the cholesterol is equilibrated in 
the butter oil and about 5 percent or greater is in the 
membrane.  Roughly, the skim milk contains about 10% to 
about 20% of the cholesterol that is in whole milk. Skim 
milk contains less than about 0.5% fat, about 10% solids 
and typically about 2 to about 3 mg of cholesterol per 
100 g of skim milk. The cholesterol in milk products is thought to 
be associated with triglycerides, milk fat globules and 
complex proteins. Cholesterol in skim milk is thought to 
exist in three forms: (i) complexed with residual 
triglyceride droplets not removed in the skimming 
process, (ii) complexed with lipoprotein particles 
sloughed off from milk fat globule membranes in the 
skimming process, and (iii) complexed with proteins 
contained in the serum albumin. When skim milk, reduced-fat 
or whole milk is concentrated, its cholesterol 
content increases proportionally. For example, nonfat 
dry milk has a cholesterol content of about 20-30 mg per 
100 grams. Therefore, the use of skim milk, reduced-fat 
or

product of between about 1:99 to about 1:4, shearing the 

mixture, and separating the oil and milk phases by 
centrifugation. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the sheared 
mixture is held with agitation for a time prior to 

centrifugation of between about 20 minutes to about 2 hours. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein the sheared 
mixture is held for a time of between about a half hour to 

about an hour. 
A method according to claim 2 or claim 3, wherein 
the mixture is agitated at about 150 RPM during the holding 

step.
