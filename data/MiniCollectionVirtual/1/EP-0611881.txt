<ABSTRACT>
Piezoelectric element used in a fuel injection valve is 
to be improved in its response to expansion and contraction, 

while the supply of an excess energy to the piezoelectric 
element is to be controlled. 
In a fuel injection control device in which an output 
voltage 
of the dc-dc converter (1) is applied to a piezoelectric 
element (PZT) via a choke coil (Lc) and a thyristor (SCR‚ÇÅ, a current 

detection unit (2) is provided between the dc-dc converter and 
the thyristor. A measured value of the electric charge, as 

found by integrating a charging current flowing through the 
current detection unit is compared by a comparator (5) to a 

command value of electrical charges as found by processing 
the dc-dc converter output voltage. The results of 

comparison are supplied to a latch unit (9) so as to be latched 
at the timing of a peak value of the charging current. A 

capacitor (C
v
 is charged and discharged depending on an output 
of the latch unit, and the terminal voltage across the 

capacitor and the output voltage of the dc-dc converter are 
compared to each other for controlling the output voltage of 

the dc-dc converter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel injection control 
device for an internal combustion engine. More 
particularly, it relates to a fuel injection control device 
in which a piezoelectric element is employed in a fuel 
injection valve and in which the shape change in the element  
 
caused by application of an electric voltage thereto is 
utilized. It has hitherto been known to use a piezoelectric 
element for a fuel injection valve for controlling the fuel 
injection. For example, the JP Patent KOKAI Publication 
No.64-69756 (1989) discloses means for stabilizing changes 
in capacitance of a piezoelectric element caused by changes 
in temperature. The piezoelectric element is increased in 
capacitance with the rise in temperature. If the 
capacitance is increased, the piezoelectric element is 
deformed to a larger extent for the same applied voltage 
because the deformation in the piezoelectric element is 
proportionate to the amount of the stored electric charge 
which is proportionate to the capacitance value. The above 
cited publication proposes a fuel injection control device 
equipped with means for detecting the change in temperature 
of the piezoelectric element and accordingly controlling the 
voltage applied to the piezoelectric element for controlling 
a displacement of the piezoelectric element. In the injection control device, the fuel is usually 
supplied in a quantity proportionate to the fuel injection  
 
time. A control signal for controlling the fuel injection 
time is supplied from a micro-computer to the fuel injection 
control device as pulse signals. Heretofore, problems have existed that the electric 
voltage applied to the piezoelectric element is reduced 
during the transient period when the fuel injection control 
signal pulse is changed from a narrow pulse width state to a 
broad pulse width state, as a result of which the 
piezoelectric element can not be extended to a pre-determined 
value until the steady state is reached and the 
stable control is initiated, and hence the piezoelectric 
element can not be used as the injection port during such 
time. On the other hand, when the fuel injection control 
signal is changed from a broad pulse width state to a narrow 
pulse width state, the voltage applied to the piezoelectric 
element is increased during the transient period, such that 
an electric energy is applied in a value more than is 
necessary to the piezoelectric element until the steady 
state is reached and stable control is initiated. It is therefore an object of the
