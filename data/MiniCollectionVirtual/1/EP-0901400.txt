<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to pressure
regulation and self-contained breathing systems such as
those used in scuba diving equipment and more
specifically, to a new improved means for automatically
altering the breathing characteristics of a demand-type
regulator by automatic adjustment of the venturi action
in the regulator in accordance with depth during
diving. Pressure regulators such as those employed in
underwater breathing apparatus, utilize the pressure
differential on opposite sides of a flexible diaphragm
to operate an air valve which supplies air to a
breathing chamber from which the diver breathes.
Typically, such a flexible diaphragm is mounted to
cover an opening in the wall of the breathing chamber
whereby expansion of the diaphragm actuates the air
valve. More specifically, when the diver inhales while
the air inlet valve is closed, the pressure in the
breathing chamber is reduced causing the diaphragm to
bow inwards inside the breathing chamber and thereby
allowing an air inlet valve to open. When the diver
exhales, pressure in the chamber increases causing the
diaphragm to move out to its original condition thereby
closing the air inlet valve.Recent prior art includes disclosure of various
pressure regulator structures which provide a reduction
in the effort required by the diver to breathe from
such regulators. More specifically, regulators have
been designed so that a portion of the inlet air 
travels into the breathing mouthpiece area in the form
of a stream of air which produces a venturi effect.
This venturi effect further reduces the pressures in
the breathing chamber so that in effect the diver is
not necessarily doing all the work required to
sufficiently reduce the breathing chamber pressure to
pull in and retain the diaphragm and cracking effort
force setting whereby to open the air inlet valve.
Thus. the venturi effect makes its easier for the diver
to inhale air from the regulator. Breathing regulators
which employ such venturi-type action to assist in
responding to the breathing demand of the diver are
highly advantageous. Unfortunately, they are not
always optimally configured for the breathing
requirements for each diver or for particular diving
depths where ambient pressure increases as a function
of depth thereby changing the parameters for the
diver's degree of breathing difficulty and breathing
requirements.In most scuba diving situations, the requirement for
the second stage regulator can change. On the surface,
the regulator must be stable. The second

<CLAIMS>
A second stage breathing regulator (10) for divers, the
regulator having a demand valve (12) to be connected to a source of pressurized air

and a pressure-activated device (16, 20, 22) for opening the demand valve (12) to direct air into
the regulator (10) and to a mouthpiece tube (28) to be held in the mouth by a diver, the

regulator of the type wherein changes in the direction of air flow out of an air
exit (24) within the regulator (10) produces a variation in venturi effect from small to

large to progressively reduce the breathing effort required to keep open the
demand valve (12);

   a deflector member (30) located within said regulator (10) for movement relative
to said air exit (24) for redirecting said air flow relative to said mouthpiece tube (28)

to change said venturi effect 
characterised by

   an ambient water pressure responsive controlling means for controlling the movement of said deflector member (30) in
response to the ambient water pressure surrounding said regulator (10).
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 1 wherein said movement
controlling means comprises a piston having a piston head (33) and a piston rod (32),

the piston head (33) separating two respectively isolated chambers including a first
chamber (38) having ambient water pressure therein and a second chamber (36) having

surface water pressure therein; the relative difference in the pressures in said
first and second chambers (36, 38) determining the position of said piston.
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 2 wherein said deflector member (30)
comprises a distal end of said piston rod (32).
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 2 wherein said movement
controlling means further comprises a compression spring (34) located for resisting

the movement of said piston rod (32) toward said air exit (24).
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 2 further comprising an O-ring (40)
positioned annularly around said piston head (33) for isolating the first and second

chambers (36, 38) from one another.
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 1 wherein said movement
controlling means comprises a piston having a rod portion (32) and a head portion (33);

the head portion (33) providing a movable sealing surface between a first chamber (38) 
at ambient water pressure and a second chamber (36) at a selected constant water

pressure, said rod portion (32) having a distal end terminating in said deflector
member (30), whereby increasing ambient water pressure forces said piston to

move said deflector member (30) toward said air exit (24).
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 1, said regulator (10) having a first
chamber (38) open to ambient water pressure and a second chamber (36) having an

initially selected pressure therein, said means comprising a piston having a
sealing head (33) separating said first and second chambers (36, 38) and said piston also

having a rod (32) terminating in said deflector member (30), said piston being forced to
move in accordance with the pressure difference between said first and second

chambers (36, 38).
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 7 further comprises a spring (34)
positioned relative to said piston rod (32) to add resistance to movement of said

deflector member (30) toward said air exit (24) whereby tending to return said deflector
member (30) to a stable position of minimum venturi effect.
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 7 further comprising at least one
O-ring (40) for isolating said first chamber (38) from said second chamber (36).
A second stage breathing regulator according to claim 7 further comprising at least one
