Actuator for a movable element (6) with an oscillating drive (1, 17) in order to drive
the movable element, wherein the movable element is kept in contact with the oscillating

drive and the movable element is constructed as a flexible elongate band-like or wire-like
structure, wherein there is provided as the oscillating drive a substantially hollow cylindrical

oscillatory stator (1), at the circumferential surface of which a circulating travelling wave is
excited and the movable element (6) loops around the oscillatory stator partly, one time or

several times and a roller (7) or lever mechanism (7a) arranged at a predetermined
spacing from the oscillatory stator or a part fastened to the movable element (6) is driven

by the movable element (6).
Actuator according to claim 1, characterised in that the movable element (6) loops
around [by]
 the roller (7) with the same orientation as the oscillatory stator (1).
Actuator according to claim 2, characterised in that a second roller is or several
further rollers are provided and that the movable element (6) loops around the further roller

or rollers with the same orientation as the oscillatory stator (1).
Actuator according to claim 1 to 3, characterised in that one or more rollers (9, 10)
is or are provided and looped around by the movable element (6) with opposite orientation

to the oscillatory stator (1).
Actuator according to claim 1 to 4, characterised in that several of the rollers (11),
which are looped around by the movable element (6) with opposite orientation to the

oscillatory stator (1), hold the oscillatory stator in a form of mounting.
Actuator according to claim 1 to 5, characterised in that two of the rollers (14, 13),
which are looped around by the movable element (6) with opposite orientation to the

oscillatory stator (1), are resiliently coupled together for setting of the contact force
between the oscillatory stator (1) and movable element (6).
Actuator according to claim 1 to 6, characterised in that guide grooves (15) for
receiving the movable element (6) are provided in the circumferential surface of the

oscillatory stator (1) substantially concentrically with the cylinder axis. 
Actuator according to claim 1, characterised in that in addition to the movable
element (6) one or more further movable elements (6') is or are provided and loop around

the cylinder circumference, wherein guide grooves (15) arranged substantially
concentrically with the cylinder axis are provided for each of these elements.
Actuator according to claim 1, characterised in that means (19, 20) for exerting and
adjusting a motive power between the oscillating drive (17) and the movable element (6).
Actuator according to claim 1 to 7 or 9, characterised in that an endless movable
belt is provided as the movable element (6).
