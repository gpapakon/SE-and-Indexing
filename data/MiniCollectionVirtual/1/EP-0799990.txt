<ABSTRACT>
The fuel tank has a contents level measurer (3) and a sucking jet pump in a housing (4). The housing is fastened to the floor of the tank (2), and also carries the level measurer. It is fastened to the floor via a plug or clip connection (5). Fuel tank and pump housing may consist of plastic, and in this case the two are welded together. The housing and the carrier (7) for the level measurer consist of a single part.
