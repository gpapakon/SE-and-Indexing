<ABSTRACT>
In a method for palletising tubular sections made of paper or such like materials closed into a tubular shape by means of a longitudinal adhesive seam, for the production of sacks or bags, the tubular sections are supplied in the form of tube bundles (2) by a tube machine to a palletising device (1) having a loading apparatus (5). By means of this, the tube bundles are transferred individually or in groups to a respective supporting base (6) of a rack-type pallet (3) and, in a storage position of the pallet between the palletising operation and subsequent depalletisation, are held pressed together over their surface on their respective supporting base. To execute a palletising operation, the respective tube bundle in the loading apparatus is raised, is then introduced into the pallet into a position at a distance above the supporting base and, when the intended position is reached, is deposited on the supporting base by the execution of a vertical setting-down movement. Immediately after the supporting base has been occupied by one or more tube bundles, the pressing together over the surface is carried out individually for this supporting base.
