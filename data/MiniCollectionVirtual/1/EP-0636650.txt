<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to propylene polymer 
compositions, and more particularly to propylene polymer 
compositions capable of producing molded products excellent 
in rigidity and impact strength as well as in heat 
resistance. Crystalline polypropylene is excellent in rigidity, 
heat resistance and surface glossiness, but is poor in 
impact resistance. Therefore, various polypropylene compositions improved 
in the impact resistance have been heretofore proposed. 
For example, polypropylene compositions containing 
crystalline polypropylene and modifiers such as 
polyethylene and rubber-like materials are known. Examples 
of the rubber-like materials conventionally used include a 
non-crystalline or low-crystalline ethylene/propylene 
random copolymer (EPR), polyisobutylene and polybutadiene. In order to improve the impact resistance by adding 
such a rubber-like material as mentioned above, a large 
amount of the rubber-like material must be added to 
polypropylene. However, polypropylene compositions 
containing a large amount of the rubber-like material are  
 
lowered in the rigidity, the heat resistance and the 
surface hardness, though they are improved in the impact 
resistance. On that account, polypropylene compositions further 
containing inorganic fillers in combination with the 
rubber-like materials have been proposed to improve 
rigidity, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publications No. 58459/1985, No. 60154/1985, No. 
233048/1986, No. 36348/1986, No. 235350/1987, No. 
122751/1988, No. 150343/1988, No. 149845/1989, No. 
204947/1989, No. 271450/1989, etc. However, the polypropylene compositions containing a 
large amount of the rubber-like material have a limit in 
the improvement in rigidity by the addition of the 
inorganic filler, and therefore they cannot be applied to 
such uses as require high rigidity. As a replacement of such conventional polypropylene 
compositions, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 
156842/1988 proposes a polypropylene composition comprising 
polypropylene of high stereoregularity and a 
polystyrene·polyethylene/polybutylene·polystyrene block 
copolymer (SEBS), which shows good rigidity and impact 
resistance. However, it has been desired to develop 
polypropylene compositions much more improved in rigidity 
and impact resistance according to uses. The present invention has been made in the light of 
the foregoing prior art technique, and it is an object of 
the invention to provide propylene polymer compositions 
which are excellent in
