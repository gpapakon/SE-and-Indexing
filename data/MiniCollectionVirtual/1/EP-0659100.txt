<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support device on a ski for a boot whose ends are held by a front binding and a rear binding (1). The support device comprises a support plate (16) with a support surface (17). The support plate (16) is guided for exclusive motion in a vertical plane. An elastically compressible material block is placed between the support plate (16) and the upper surface of the ski, and said block is compressed during downward motion of the support plate (16). The device is characterized in that it is also provided with a movable slide (28) which acts on the support plate (16) to adjustably limit its travel motion.

Support device on a ski for a boot whose ends are 
retained by a front binding element and a rear binding 

element, comprising a support plate (16) with a support 
surface (17) of reduced dimensions in order to support a 

portion of the sole of the boot, means (18) to render the 
support plate mobile, said means guiding the movement of 

support plate (16) along a vertical direction and means (20, 
8) that limit its displacement to a maximum predetermined 

height with respect to the upper surface of the ski, 
comprising, furthermore, an elastically compressible block 

(25) wedged between the support plate and the upper surface of 
the ski, which gets compressed during the downward movement of 

the mobile plate and which returns it elastically towards its 
maximum height, characterized in that it comprises, moreover, 

a mobile cursor (28) that acts on support plate (16) so as to 
adjustably limit its travel distance. 
Device as defined by claim 1, characterized in that 
support plate (16) is journaled to the ski about a transverse 

and horizontal axis (18) that is fixed with respect to the ski 
at the level of one of its front or rear edges, and wherein 

the other transverse edge of the support plate is free and 
wherein cursor (28) acts on this other edge. 
Device as defined by claim 2, characterized in that 
cursor (28) is mobile along a longitudinal direction, in that 

it comprises at least one tooth (38, 39) that is adapted to 
get engaged beneath the free edge of support plate (16). 
Device as defined by claim 2, characterized in that 
support plate (16) has on its rear edge, a tongue (20) that 

cooperates with a window (8) that is fixed with respect to the 
ski, so to limit, at least upwardly, the movement of the 

support plate. 
Device as defined by claim 1 for a support plate (16)  
 

associated to a binding element (1) assembled to the ski by 
means of a base (4), characterized in that base (4) has a 

means for guiding cursor (28) along the longitudinal direction 
defined by the ski. 
Device as defined by claim 1 for a support plate (16) 
associated to a binding element (1) assembled to the ski by 

means of a base (4) comprising a slide (5) enveloped by a 
sheathing element (10), characterized in that a guiding space 

is provided between slide (5) and sheathing element (10) for 
cursor (28). 
Device as defined by claims 5 or 6, characterized in 
that cursor (28) has a thrustor (32, 33) on each side of 

binding element (1), said thrustor being mobile along a 
longitudinal direction and whose displacement is linked to the 

displacement of the cursor. 
Device as defined by claim 7, for a rear binding 
element, comprising a body (3) slidably mounted along a slide 

(5), the slide (5) being enveloped by a sheathing element 
(10), characterized in that slide (5) extends towards the 

front by a base plate (6), that support plate (16) is 
connected to base plate (6) by its front edge about a 

transverse axis (18), that the rear edge of the support plate 
is mobile, that cursor (28), when seen from a frontal view, 

has a U shape, whose vertical arms (30, 31) are guided between 
the slide and the sheathing element and are accessible via 

lateral openings (34, 35) of sheathing element (10), that the 
cursor has, towards the front, two lateral teeth (38, 39) that 

are mobile with the cursor between two extreme positions, one 
position where they are disengaged from the mobile edge of 

support plate (16), and one position where they are engaged 
beneath support plate (16) and limit its travel distance. 
Device as defined by claim 8, characterized in that 
cursor (28) has teeth (45) whose upper support portion (46) is  

 
stepped. 
Device as defined by claim 8, characterized in that 
cursor (28) has teeth (47) whose upper support portion (48) is 

inclined with respect to the horizontal plane.
