<ABSTRACT>
A process for purifying fluoropolymers by contacting them at temperatures above 140  C with a liquid perfluorinated cycloalkane. The resulting polymers are particularly useful where polymers with reduced impurities are desirable, such as in medical devices and in parts for the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The liquid perfluorinated cycloalkanes improve the adhesion of fluoropolymer to themselves and other materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
Fluoropolymers with melting points above about 
200°C are purified by extraction with a perfluorinated 
cycloalkane whose boiling point at atmospheric pressure 
is 140°C or more. It is well known that most polymers contain 
"impurities", materials that are different from the 
higher molecular polymer that constitutes the main part 
of the polymer. These impurities are often low 
molecular polymer (oligomer) and other impurities used 
or made in the polymerization process, such as initiator 
fragments or surfactants. For many polymers, 
particularly those not containing fluorine, purification 
can be accomplished by extracting the polymer with a 
"solvent" which swells the polymer somewhat, and also 
dissolves the impurities. Fluorocarbon polymers, particularly perfluorocarbon 
polymers that have relatively high melting points are 
not usually purified by extraction, since solvents that 
swell the polymers and can dissolve oligomers and other 
impurities are limited. European Patent Application 472,908 describes such 
an extraction using fluorine containing solvents. 
However, all of the solvents used or mentioned in this 
patent have boiling points below 100°C. In order to 
reach even moderately warm (80-100°C) temperatures the 
use of a pressure vessel is required. Even then only 
very small amounts of impurities are extracted. In the instant invention use of perfluorinated 
cycloalkanes (PFC) with atmospheric boiling points above  
 
140°C allows the extraction to be run without a 
pressure vessel, and the extraction is faster and more 
"impurities" can be extracted. The purified polymer can 
be used in medical devices and in parts for 
semiconductor manufacturing industry, in both of which 
uses impurities can be very deleterious. This invention concerns a process for the 
purification of fluoropolymers, comprising, contacting, 
at an extraction temperature of 140°C or more, a 
fluoropolymer with a liquid perfluorinated cycloalkane, 
provided that: 
said fluoropolymer has a melting point of 
200°C or more; said extraction temperature is below said 
melting point; and said perfluorinated cycloalkane has a boiling 
point of 140°C or more at atmospheric pressure. By a fluoropolymer herein is meant a polymer that 
contains at least 35% by weight of fluorine, 
preferably at least 50% by weight of fluorine. In 
one preferred embodiment, the fluoropolymer is a 
perfluoropolymer, that is contains essentially no 
hydrogen or other (than fluorine) halogen in the 
polymer. In another preferred embodiment the
