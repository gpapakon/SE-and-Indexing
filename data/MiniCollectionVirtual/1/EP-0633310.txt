<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a "builder" or "cobuilder" preformulation for a detergent composition, containing at least one polyimide polymer mixed with at least one silicate and capable of generating at least one biodegradeable water-soluble polypeptide species when it comes into contact with an aqueous medium of non-alkaline pH. The present invention also relates to the applications of this preformulation in the field of detergency (detergents).
