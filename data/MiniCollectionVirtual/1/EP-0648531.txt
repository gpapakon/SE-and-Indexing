<ABSTRACT>
A device for the treatment of fluids, in particular to the application of 
high frequency energy to liquids, comprises an annular member (6) having an 

internal circumferential surface (7) and an external circumferential surface (8). 
Power means (12) is provided which is operative to cause a transducer (10) to 

vibrate at ultrasonic frequency, said vibrations being applied to the annular 
member through a flat surface thereof. In the configuration described, the outer 

surface (8) and the inner surface (7) alternately radially expand and contract in 
a pulsating manner, applying ultrasonic energy to a liquid flowing over said 

surfaces. 
In alternative embodiments, a plurality of annular members are 
secured together, to provide a compound vibrating device over or through which 

liquid to be treated may be fed, conveniently by the location of the device in a 
tank (40, 78).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements relating to fluid
processing, and in particular to the application of high frequency (particularly
ultrasonic) energy to fluids.In a variety of liquid chemical processes reaction efficiency is improved
by the application of ultrasonic energy to the liquids in a process commonly
referred to as "sonochemistry". Conventionally used is a longitudinally vibrating
probe which is inserted into a reaction vessel, or through which reaction liquids
are fed. Difficulty is encountered in conventional devices in increasing the level
at which energy is transferred to the liquid, and in general an emerging density
limit of between 30 and 50 watts/litre is regarded as a practical limit for the
known devices. Attempts to increase the energy input beyond this level causes
decoupling to occur, and/or the generation of vapour at the interface between the
vibrating surface of the device and the liquid, and it is one of the various objects
of this invention to provide a fluid processing device enabling a higher energy
input to be achieved, and/or a higher frequency of energy to be input, and/or a
conventional level of energy as regards both input level and frequency to be input
more conveniently.For example, there is disclosed in WO92/12790 an ultrasonic
processing device in which liquid to be processed is fed through an axial bore 14,
and ultrasonic transducer causes the circumferential walls defining the bore to
vibrate in the radial plane, causing the bore to increase and decrease in diameter
at ultrasonic frequency. A similar arrangement is shown in WO82/03795.In both of these documents, the amount of ultrasonic energy which is
applied to the liquid as it flows through the processing device is limited.Conversely, it is one of the various objects of this invention to provide
a liquid processing device by which significantly higher energy input at ultrasonic
frequency may be applied to the liquid being treated, than has here to for been
possible. The invention has been devised in relation to a processing device for
applying ultrasonic energy to a liquid system, in which context the invention will
hereinafter be described in detail. It is however to be appreciated that the
principles of the invention could be applied where similar requirements are
encountered in gaseous systems, or liquid/gaseous systems, and for convenience
the term "fluid" as used hereinafter is to be understood, where the context
permits, as including both gaseous systems and liquid/gaseous systems.
