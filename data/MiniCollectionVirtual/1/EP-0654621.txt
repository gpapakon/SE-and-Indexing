<ABSTRACT>
A gear mounting is disclosed for use in a compound change gear 
transmission (10) having an intermediate wall portion (50), a shaft support 

portion (66) axially spaced from the intermediate wall portion (50). Disposed 
axially between the intermediate wall portion and the shaft support portion is a 

gear member (48). The intermediate wall portion and shaft support portions 
define aligned shaft bores (92,96) with the shaft member (98) disposed therein, 

and including retention means (122) to retain the shaft member within the 
bores. The shaft member defines lubricant passage means (100) permitting 

flow of lubrication fluid through the shaft and into a set of bearings (64) which 
receive the forward end of an adjacent countershaft (60). The outer surface of 

the shaft member (98) defines an inner race for a set of bearings (120) 
disposed between the shaft and the gear member (48). The disclosed mounting 

arrangement substantially simplifies and strengthens the mounting of the gear 
member (48).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to gear-type devices such as compound change 
gear transmissions, and more particularly, to improved mounting means for 
gears, for use in such gear devices. Although the present invention may be used in various types of gear 
devices, it is especially advantageous when used in a compound change gear 
transmission of the type comprising a main transmission section connected in 
series with an auxiliary transmission section, and will be described in 
connection therewith. In compound change gear transmissions of the type described above, 
each of the main and auxiliary transmission sections typically includes a 
mainshaft and one or more countershafts, and most of the gears included in the 
transmission surround or are mounted on one of the mainshafts or one of the 
countershafts. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,703,667, assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention. In a typical compound change gear transmission of the type described 
above, and by way of example only, it is necessary to provide an idler gear in 
meshing engagement with both the countershaft (or a gear mounted thereon), 
and the reverse gear mounted on the mainshaft. Thus, the idler is typically 
referred to as the "reverse idler gear", and is mounted on a reverse idler shaft, 
separate from the mainshaft and the countershafts, as may be seen in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,735,109, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, 
which shows the features of the precharacterizing portion of claim 1. A typical compound change gear 
transmission has two countershafts in the main section, and therefore, there is 
a reverse idler gear and shaft arrangement associated with each countershaft.  
 The typical compound change gear transmission with which the present 
invention is especially advantageous has a housing including an intermediate 
wall portion separating the transmission front section from the rear section, 
either of which may comprise the "main transmission section", and either of 
which may comprise the "auxiliary transmission section". Received within the 
intermediate wall portion, within suitable bearings, are the rearward ends of the 
front countershafts and the forward ends of the rear countershafts. Adjacent 
the intermediate wall portion, the transmission case or housing typically 
includes another wall portion through which extends the reverse idler shaft. As 
is illustrated somewhat schematically in above-mentioned U.S. Patent No. 
4,735,109, and as will be illustrated and described herein
