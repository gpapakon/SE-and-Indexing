<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reusable greetings card with 
removable elements which are suitable for composing a personalised 
message. Greetings notes or cards bearing preprinted illustrations and writing 
are currently known and commercially available so as to meet the 
needs of those who, wishing to communicate a certain message in an 
imaginative manner, are unable, either because they possess little 
imagination or through lack of time, or else because they have little 
skill at drawing, to create a note which achieves a satisfactory 
communication effect. These preprinted cards, in order to be appreciated by the largest 
number of consumers possible, are produced in various quantities 
and versions with considerable costs of both creative design and of 
the actual use of raw materials for production. Nevertheless, in spite of these efforts by firms in the industry, the 
consumer often does not find, among the preprinted cards on offer, 
the one which corresponds to the situation or to the personal  
 
message to be communicated, so that a part of greetings cards 
remains unsold, involving considerable financial loss for the firms 
which produce and market such a product. Another problem posed by traditional cards or notes concerns the fact 
that, since they are made in paper material, they cannot, after they 
have been written on, be reused, since the personal messages written 
thereon either can no longer be erased or, if erased, leave in any case 
traces on the paper sheet of the note. The traditional card is thus disadvantageous since each time new 
message has to be communicated a new card has to be used. The object of the present invention is that of providing a greetings 
card which avoids the aforementioned disadvantages, whereby 
anybody can easily compose a personalised imaginative message 
and which moreover has such a structure that it allows it to be reused 
for a virtually unlimited number of messages. The main object of the present invention is achieved by a greetings 
card comprising at least one main sheet in paper material or the like 
bearing writings and/or illustrations defining a message of greetings or 
one of another kind, a board having a surface on which is possible to 
write by a suitable felt pen whose writings are dry wipable and means 
for fastening said board to said main sheet.  By the present greetings card, it is possible to easily wipe the writings 
made on the board and reuse the card since no traces of the writings 
are left on the board. The present
