<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a disposable nappy (10) with an underwear-protection sheet (11), an absorbent layer (16), a non-woven cover sheet (12) pervious to liquids, and a hydrophobic non-woven overlay (22) which has an opening (30) and seal flaps (24, 26) and whose edges form a seal with the underwear-protection sheet (11). In order to achieve improved leaktightness, the invention calls for the width of the liquid-pervious non-woven cover sheet (12) to be smaller, in the crutch region (42) of the nappy, than that of the underwear-protection sheet (11) and for the hydrophobic non-woven overlay (22), in the crutch region (42) of the nappy, to overlap the longitudinal edges (13) of the liquid-pervious non-woven cover sheet (12) and to be sealed to the underwear-protection sheet (11).

Disposable diaper (10) having a protective film (11) that is 
impermeable to liquids, a liquid-permeable non-woven fabric cover 

(12) connected with such film, an absorbent body (16) being 
arranged between the protective film (11) and the non-woven fabric 

cover (12) and comprising two first sealing flaps (24) extending 
respectively along the longitudinal edges (18) of the absorbent body 

(16) and applied on the non-woven fabric cover (12), each of the 
flaps comprising lengthwise extending strip-like elasticizing means 

(36) fixed on both ends, and having further second sealing sealing 
flaps (26) extending transversely relative to the first sealing flaps 

(24) in the end regions of the absorbent body (16), the flaps (24, 
26) forming the edge (32, 34) of an opening (30) located in the 

crotch area (42) of the diaper in a hydrophobic non-woven fabric 
cover (22) applied on the liquid-permeable non-woven fabric cover 

(12),
characterized in that
 
the width of the liquid-permeable non-woven fabric cover (12) is 

smaller, in the crotch area of the diaper (42), than the width of the 
protective film (11) and that the hydrophobic non-woven fabric 

cover (22) overlies the longitudinal edges (13) of the liquid-permeable 
non-woven fabric cover (12) in the crotch area (42) of the 

diaper, and is connected in this area with the protective film (11) in 
sealing relationship.  

 
Disposable diaper (10) according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
hydrophobic non-woven fabric layer (22) extends substantially flush 

with the edges of the protective film (11). 
Disposable diaper (10) according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the longitudinal dimension of the liquid-permeable non-woven 

fabric cover (12) is smaller than that of the protective film (11). 
Disposable diaper (10) according to any of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the end faces (14) of the non-woven fabric 

cover (12) extend substantially flush with the edges of the protective 
film (11). 
Disposable diaper (10) according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that the elasticizing means (36) are arranged along 
the free edges (32) of the first flaps (24) that extend in the 

longitudinal direction of the diaper (10). 
Disposable diaper (10) according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
elasticizing means (36) are arranged inside the folded free marginal 

portion of the flap (32). 
Disposable diaper (10) according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the ends of the elasticizing means (36) are fixed 

between the edges of the opening (34) on the end faces and the 
respective adjacent edges (48) of the protective film (11).
