<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for driving piezoelectric units of an 
ink jet recording head (51) to control the ink jet recording 

head (51) to jet ink droplets having uniform sizes and at 
uniform jetting velocity, without being influenced by any 

change in the temperature of the surrounding environment. In 
one embodiment, two constant current sources (45,46) are 

employed provide driving voltages (V
s
) which charge and 
discharge a capacitor (C), and the voltage of the capacitor 

is amplified to provide the voltage for driving the 
piezoelectric units. In another embodiment, a digital output 

from a counter (114), having a clock frequency controlled in 
accordance with the temperature of the environment, is 

converted into an analog voltage signal rising or falling in 
stages. This analog voltage signal is amplified to provide a 

driving voltage for driving the piezoelectric units.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
for driving an ink jet recording head.Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) illustrate a conventional on-demand
type ink jet recording head for an ink jet printer. In
particular, Fig. 1(a) is a sectional view of on actuator of the
ink jet recording head, and Fig. 1(b) illustrates in electrical
equivalent circuit for the same.An ink chamber 2 of the actuator id formed of an ink
chamber frame 1 and a vibrating plate 4, and a piezoelectric
unit 5, which expands and contracts as controlled by an
electric field applied thereto, is rigidly mounted on the
vibrating plate 4. The volumetric capacity of the ink chamber
2 is expanded or contracted as the vibrating plate 4 is
displaced by operation of the piezoelectric unit 5. To impose on electric field on the piezoelectric unit
5, an electric voltage is applied from an outside power source
via driving line 7 to an electrode 6 which is disposed on the
piezoelectric unit 5. This applied voltage causes a distortion
in the piezoelectric unit 5, and this distorting force causes
the vibrating plate 4 to exert an abrupt pressing force on the
ink chamber 2, thereby jetting forth ink droplets 3 out of very
small holes present in the ink chamber frame 1. A plurality of
actuators such as this are disposed in the an ink jet recording
head.The piezoelectric unit 5 can be represented in
electrical terms an a capacitor, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Accordingly, electric current in proportion to the time
differential of the waveform of the applied voltage flows as a
charging current and a discharging current when the electric
field is applied and removed, respectively.As the voltage is applied to and removed from the
piezoelectric unit 5 at a higher frequency, the charging
current and the discharging current increases. Hence, when a
large number of driving elements are present in the
piezoelectric unit 5, for example, when 24 elements are driven,
the charging or discharging current will have a peak value of
50A. Consequently, a large drop in the voltage on the driving
line 7 occurs. This results in a considerable change in the
jetting characteristics effected by the driving elements in the 
piezoelectric unit 5, and also a breakdown of electronic
components in the piezoelectric unit 5.Therefore, in an attempt to eliminate these problems,
a method for driving a piezoelectric unit exists in which the
charging and discharging currents are limited by current
limiting resistors. This method is described in United States
Patents Nos. 4,459,599,
