<ABSTRACT>
An acylated cellulose film having high surface 
property, transparency and uniformity in quality is 

produced, without using an environment-polluting solvent, 
by dissolving an acylated cellulose in a water-free 

solvent consisting essentially of 60 to 100% by weight of 
1,3-dioxolane and 0 to 40% by weight of another solvent 

material, the acylated cellulose/solvent weight ratio 
being 1/25 to 1/2; spreading the acylated cellulose 

solution on a film-forming support surface; and drying 
the spread acylated cellulose solution layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing an acylated cellulose film. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a method of producing an
acylated cellulose film having a high surface property,
transparency and uniformity in quality, by a film-casting
method using a solvent comprising 1,3-dioxolane which is
a halogen-free, non-environment-polluting solvent.It is known that an acylated cellulose, for
example, cellulose acetate, is useful for producing
various films, for example, photographic base film and
packing film. Recently, cellulose acetate film is
practically utilized as a protecting film for a
polarizing plate of a liquid crystal display device.The properties of the cellulose acetate are
quite variable depending on a degree of polymerization
and a degree of acetylation thereof. Generally, the
higher the degree of polymerization and the degree of
acetylation, the higher the heat resistance, humidity
resistance and dimensional stability, and the lower the
processability and solubility.Presently, it is believed that cellulose
triacetate having a high molecular weight can be
dissolved at a high concentration only in methylene
chloride, and thus a cellulose triacetate film is
practically produced from a cellulose triacetate solution
in methylene chloride by a film-casting method. However,
in consideration of the fact that methylene chloride is a
carcinogen and an environment-polluting substance, the
use of methylene chloride is now going to be prohibited.
This disadvantage of methylene chloride is derived from
the low boiling point of 40°C and thus the solvent is 
evaporated away during the film-production process so as
to accelerate the pollution of the environment.Under the above-mentioned circumstances, a new
solvent for acylated cellulose is strongly demanded to be
developed.An object of the present invention is to provide a
method of producing an acylated cellulose film having
excellent surface characteristics, transparency and
optical isotropy and a low content of residual solvent,
by using a halogen-free solvent.The inventors of the present invention conducted
extensive research to attain the above-mentioned object,
and as a result it was discovered that 1,3-dioxolane is a
good solvent for various acylated celluloses, and the
resultant acylated cellulose solution in 1,3-dioxolane
exhibits a high stability even at a high concentration
thereof and thus an acylated cellulose film can be
produced from the solution by a dry film-forming method.
The present invention was

A method of producing an acylated cellulose film
comprising the steps of:


dissolving an acylated cellulose in a solvent free
from water and consisting of 60 to 100% by weight of 1,3-dioxolane

and 0 to 40% by weight of another solvent material in
a ratio in weight of the acylated cellulose to the solvent of

1/25 to 1/2, to provide an acylated cellulose solution;
spreading the acylated cellulose solution on a film-forming
surface of a support; and
drying the spread acylated cellulose solution layer
to form a dried acylated cellulose film,

out in two or more steps in such a manner that in one or more

initial stages, the spread acylated cellulose solution layer is
dried on the film-forming support surface at a temperature of

from 30°C to 130°C in an atmosphere consisting essentially
of an inert gas and 1,3-dioxolane gas

to an extent that the content of the
residual solvent remaining in the resultant dried film is

reduced to a level of 5 to 30% by weight, and then in a final
stage, the initially dried film is removed from the film-forming

surface of the support and further dried at a
temperature of from 100°C to 200°C in the ambient air

atmosphere or an inert gas atmosphere to an extent that the
content of the residual solvent remaining in the resultant

finally dried film is reduced to a level of 3% by volume or
less.
