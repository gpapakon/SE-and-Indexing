<DESCRIPTION>
 A PROCESS FOR PREPARING MOLECULAR SIEVES USING 9-AZABICYCLO[3.3.1]NONANE TEMPLATESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a process for preparing crystalline molecular sieves, particularly large pore zeolites, using a 9-azabicyclo[3.3.l]nonane ring system templating agent. More particularly, the process comprises contacting active sources of one or more oxides selected from the group consisting of monovalent element oxides, divalent element oxides, trivalent element oxides, tetravalent element oxides, and pentavalent element oxides with an organocation templating agent derived from a 9- azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane.State of the ArtNatural and synthetic crystalline molecular sieves are useful as catalysts and adsorbents. Each crystalline molecular sieve is distinguished by a crystal structure with an ordered pore structure, and is characterized by a unique X-ray diffraction pattern. Thus, the crystal structure defines cavities and pores which are characteristic of the different species. The adsorptive and catalytic properties of each crystalline molecular sieve are determined in part by the dimensions of its pores and cavities. Accordingly, the utility of a particular molecular sieve in a particular application depends at least partly on its crystal structure. 

in general, molecular sieves are prepared by crystallization in an aqueous reaction mixture containing an organic templating agent, such as a nitrogen-containing organocation. By varying the synthesis conditions and composition of the reaction mixture different zeolites can be formed.The choice of the organocation templating agents is believed to play an important role in the process of molecular sieve crystallization. Organic amines and quaternary ammonium cations were first used in the synthesis of zeolites in the early 1960s as reported by R. M. Barrer and P. J. Denny in j. Chem. Soc. 1961 at pages 971-982. This approach led to a significant increase in the number of new zeolitic structures discovered as well as an expansion in the boundaries of composition of the resultant crystalline products.Previously, products with low silica to alumina ratios (Si02/Alj03_s 10) had been obtained, but upon using the organocations as components in the starting gels, zeolites with increasingly high Si02/Al203 were realized. Some of these materials are summarized by R. M. Barrer 1982, Hydrothermal Chemistry of Zeolites, New York: Academic Press, Inc.it has been postulated that the positive charge of the organocation
