<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to polymers which comprise the reaction product of: (A) about 0-99.9 weight percent of one or more nonionic, cationic, anionic or amphoteric monomers; (B) about 0-99.9 weight percent of one or more monoethylenically unsaturated monomers different from (A); (C) about 0.1-100 weight percent of one or more monoethylenically unsaturated macromonomers different from (A) and (B); and (D) about 0-20 weight percent or greater of one or more polyethylenically unsaturated monomers different from (A), (B) and (C). When the polymers are added to latex paints and the pH adjusted, the viscosity of the paint is increased, brush drag is increased, and the paint rheology is otherwise improved. This invention also relates to macromonomer compounds useful as copolymerizable monomers in various polymerization methods and as emulsifiers in the emulsion or suspension polymerization of various monomers to produce an aqueous suspension of polymer particles. This invention further relates to complex hydrophobe compounds and to alkoxylation products, i.e., condensation reaction products of alkylene oxides and complex hydrophobe compounds having at least one active hydrogen and to alkoxylation products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymers which contain 
macromonomers and which can contain nonionic, cationic, anionic 
and/or amphoteric monomers. The polymers are especially useful as 
thickeners for aqueous systems, e.g., certain of the polymers are 
soluble in, or swelled by, an aqueous alkaline medium to provide 
thickeners for use in aqueous coating compositions, especially latex 
paints. This invention also relates to macromonomers containing 
complex hydrophobic groups and to complex hydrophobe compounds. Thickeners for aqueous systems are needed for various 
purposes, such as for architectual coatings, industrial coatings, 
automotive coatings and the like to improve rheology of the coatings. 
Hydroxyethyl cellulose is a well known thickener for aqueous 
systems, but it has various deficiencies in that excessive amounts 
must be used and the rheology of the thickened system is inadequate. 
Various ethoxylated carboxyl-functional polymers which form alkali 
soluble thickeners are also known, but these have various 
deficiencies, including inadequate hydrolytic stability. It has long been desired to provide superior thickeners 
for aqueous systems which are highly efficient, which better resist 
hydrolysis, and which provide better rheology. This is achieved 
herein by providing new polymers which possess these desired 
characteristics. This invention relates to polymers (I) comprising 
the reaction product of:  
 
(A) about 0-99.9, preferably about 10-10, weight percent of one 
or more nonionic, cationic, anionic or amphoteric monomers; (B) about 0-99.9, preferably about 30-85, weight percent of one 
or more monoethylenically unsaturated monomers different from (A); (C) about 0.1-100, preferably about 5-60, weight percent of one 
or more monoethylenically unsaturated macromonomers; and (D) about 0-20, preferably about 0-10, weight percent or greater 
of one or more polyethylenically unsaturated monomers different from (A) and (B); 
in which the monoethylenically unsaturated macromonomers (C) are 
represented by the formula: 
 
wherein: 
R1 is a monovalent residue of a substituted or unsubstituted 
complex hydrophobe compound; each R2 is the same or different and is a substituted or 
unsubstituted divalent hydrocarbon residue; R3 is a substituted or unsubstituted divalent hydrocarbon 
residue; R4, R5 and R6 are the same or different and are hydrogen or a 
substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon residue; and z is a value of 0 or greater;
