<ABSTRACT>
A food product comprises a base (18) of meat, the base being provided 
with a cavity (20) in the form of a shallow well or depression, a cover (24) of 

meat secured to the base around a peripheral line, a filling (22) of the food 
product being located within the cavity (20) which is of a size sufficient to 

accommodate at least most of the filling. The food product (16) is made by a 
machine comprising a conveyor means (56, 58), a forming means (62, 64) for the 

base, a registration means (70, 72) to register the position of successive bases (18) 
on the conveyor, automatic means (74) to locate the filling (22) on the base, a 

means (76) for forming the covers of the food products and depositing the covers 
on successive bases, and a forming machine (80) for pressing the base and cover
 
so as to form the food product into a desired shape and to ensure that the base 

and cover are secured together around said peripheral line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements relating to food 
products, and to methods of manufacture of food products. The invention has 
been devised primarily in relation to the production of a meat-based product, and 
in particular to a product based on the muscle meat of poultry. It is however to 
be appreciated that the invention may be utilised for meat in general terms, 
including fish, and particularly may be utilised in relation to re-constituted meat, 
and synthetic meat products based on vegetable protein, such a soya. In the specification of our UK patent No. 2231250 (the disclosure of 
which is hereby incorporated herein by way of reference) there is described a 
food product comprising a base of meat and a cover of meat, the base and cover 
having been secured together around a peripheral line with portions of the base 
and cover within the peripheral line being spaced apart to provide a cavity in 
which a filling of the food product is located. Such a food product is hereinafter 
referred to as being of the kind specified. A problem which on occasion occurs in the use of the product 
described in the specification of said U.K. patent is that on occasion, during 
cooking, the sauce leaks through the seal between the base and cover, and this 
is disadvantageous both to the cook and to the consumer. According to a first aspect of this invention, there is provided a food 
product of the kind specified, wherein the base is provided with a shallow well or 
depression within which filling is located. Preferably the base is in the form of a shallow cylinder, and the cavity 
is also circular, the cavity having a radius of between half and three quarters of 
the radius of the base, and the depth of the cavity being between one third and 
two thirds of the depth of the base. By location of the cavity or well (hereinafter referred to for 
convenience as cavity) beneath the plane in which the base and cover are secured  
 
together (when viewed in the orientation adopted for cooking) tendency for the 
sauce to leak from the product is significantly reduced. According to this invention there is also provided a method of making 
a food product of the kind specified, wherein during forming of the base a mould 
member is utilised to provide a depression within the base, the size of the 
depression being sufficient to accommodate at least most of the filling of the 
product during cooking. According to this invention there is also provided a base for a food 
product of the kind specified, the base

<CLAIMS>
A food product comprising a base (18) of meat, a cover (24) of meat, 
the base and cover having been secured together around a peripheral line with 

portions of the base and cover within the peripheral line being spaced apart to 
provide a cavity in which a filling (22) of the food product is located, 

characterised in that the cavity comprises a shallow well or depression (20) in the 
base, in which the filling (22) is located. 
A food product according to Claim 1 wherein the base (18) is generally 
circular in outline, and the cavity (20) is also generally circular, the radius of the 

cavity being between half and three quarters of the radius of the base, and/or the 
depth of the cavity being between
 one third and two thirds the depth of the base 
(18). 
A food product according to one of Claims 1 and 2 wherein the cavity 
(20) in the base (18) lies beneath the plane in which the base and cover are 

secured together. 
A method of making a food product of the kind specified, wherein 
during forming of the base (18) a mould member (98) is utilised to provide a 

depression (20) within the base, the size of the depression being sufficient to 
accommodate at least most of the filling (22) of the product. 
A base for a food product of the kind specified, the base (18) having 
been provided with a cavity (20) within which a filling for the food product is or 

may be located. 
A machine for the manufacture of a food product of the kind specified, 
comprising 


a) conveyor means (56, 58); 
b) means (62, 64) for forming the base, and depositing the base on the 
conveyor (58); 
c) means (70, 72) for registering the position of successive bases (18) on 
the conveyor; 
d) means (76) for forming the covers (28) of the food products and 
depositing covers on successive bases (24); and 
e) a forming means (80) comprising a plurality of mould members (82) 
mounted on a carousel (84), said carousel operating in timed 

relationship with the conveyor (58) to bring the mould members (82) 
into successive engagement with a base and cover (18, 24), to press the 

base and cover together so as to form the food product into a desired 
shape and to ensure that the base and cover are secured together 

around said peripheral line. 
A machine according to Claim 6 comprising means (74) automatically 
to locate a filling (22) for the food product on the base (18) prior to location on 

the base of the cover (24). 
A machine according to one of Claims 6 and 7 wherein each mould 
member (82) comprises a peripheral flange (86), preferably providing a cavity in 

the general form of a dome. 
A machine according to any one of Claims 6, 7 and 8 wherein each 
mould member is provided with a resilient sealing means (90) operative to engage 

the meat product around said peripheral line, to ensure securement of the base 
and cover along said peripheral line. 
A machine according to any one of Claims 6 to 9 wherein the means 
(62, 64) for forming the base is operative to provide the base with a shallow well 

or depression (20) within which the food product is located.
