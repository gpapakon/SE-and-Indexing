<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle occupant restraint apparatus (10) includes 
an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint (12) and an 

inflator (14) for providing gas for inflating the restraint 
(12). The inflator (14) contains an ignitable gas 

generating material (70) which, when ignited, generates the 
gas. The inflator has a structure (72) which defines a 

combustion chamber (78) containing the gas generating 
material (70). The inflator (14) further has an axis (66), 

and directs the gas to flow from the combustion chamber 
(78) outward through the inflator (14) and outward from the 

inflator (14) in a direction transverse to the axis (66). 
The inflator (14) is free of a tubular body wall defining 

gas flow openings at a location outward of the structure 
(72) defining the combustion chamber (78).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is a continuation-in-part of 
copending application Serial No. 024,851, filed February 
26, 1993, which in turn is a continuation of application 
Serial No. 719,322, filed June 21, 1991, now abandoned. The present invention relates to an apparatus 
including an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint, such as 
an air bag, and particularly relates to an inflator for 
inflating the restraint. U.S. Patent No. 4,817,828 discloses an apparatus 
including an inflatable air bag for restraining a vehicle 
occupant. The apparatus also includes an inflator for 
inflating the air bag. The inflator has a cylindrical 
housing containing an ignitable gas generating material 
which, when ignited, generates gas for inflating the air 
bag.  The housing has a tubular inner body wall and a 
tubular outer body wall. The inner body wall defines a 
cylindrical combustion chamber in which the gas generating 
material is contained, and has gas flow openings for 
directing the gas to flow outward from the combustion 
chamber. The housing also contains a tubular filter which 
extends circumferentially around the inner body wall. The 
outer body wall surrounds the filter, and has gas flow 
openings for directing the gas to flow outward from the 
inflator. When the inflator disclosed in the '828 patent is 
actuated, the gas generating material is ignited and 
rapidly generates the gas for inflating the air bag. The 
gas flows radially outward from the combustion chamber 
through the gas flow openings in the inner body wall and 
into the surrounding filter. The gas is filtered as it 
flows radially through the filter. It then flows radially 
outward toward the air bag through the gas flow openings in 
the outer body wall. When the gas flows through the inflator in the 
foregoing manner, it flows from the filter to the outer 
body wall around the entire inner circumference of the 
outer body wall. However, the gas flow openings in the 
outer body wall extend over limited portions of the 
circumference of the outer body wall. The outer body wall 
thus has major portions which extend circumferentially 
between the gas flow openings and which block the gas from  
 
flowing radially outward from the inflator other than at 
the locations of the gas flow openings. As a result, the 
outer body wall cools the gas, and contains the gas under 
pressure, as the gas flows against and around the outer 
body wall before it flows outward from the inflator. 
Moreover, since the gas flows outward from the inflator 
only at the
