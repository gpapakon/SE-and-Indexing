<ABSTRACT>
The setting device for pretensioning a snowboard or skis has two upwardly projecting abutments (2, 2') to be fitted on the device (1) at a distance apart, a tension rod (3), a spring component (5) and/or a damping component (6), in which the components (5, 6), may be pretensioned by adjusters (4) to a greater or lesser extent. This arrangement makes it possible to preset the curvature of a snowboard or skis as desired.

Device for the adjustment of the prestress or camber 
set of snowboards or skis, characterized by two abutments (2, 

2' ; 10, 11 ; 17, 18) to be secured in mutually spaced and 
upward projecting relationship upon the top face of a 

snowboard or ski, by a pressure rod (3, 12, 19) arranged 
therebetween, which is applied onto one abutment (10, 18) and 

guided in the other one (11, 17) for free longitudinal 
displacement, at least one stop being provided on the 

pressure rod (3, 12, 19) in the middle portion thereof and a 
spring element (5, 15, 21) and/or damping element (6, 16, 29) 

being arranged between this stop and the abutment guiding the 
pressure rod for longitudinal displacement, which element is 

more or less strongly prestressable by variation of the 
spacing between the stop and said other abutment (11, 17) and 

through means for freely adjusting the spacing between the 
said other abutment and the stop in such a manner that both 

abutments are pushed away from each other with an adjustable 
force by the prestressing of the spring and/or damping 

element and thereby a more or less marked camber set is put 
on the base, i.e. the snowboard or ski in the region between 

the abutments. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
pressure rod is made at least in a middle portion as a screw-threaded 

rod with a mounted set nut (4, 14, 20) forming said 
stop, the pressure rod (3, 12, 19) preferably locked against 

rotation, being guided in longitudinally displaceable 
relationship in the one abutment (11, 17) and being applied 

with an abuting face onto the other abutment, and in that 
between the set nut forming the adjustment means and the end 

of the pressure rod held in longitudinally displaceable 
relationship, a compression spring (5, 15, 21) and/or a 

damping element (6, 16, 29) is prestressable to any desired 
adjustable value through displacement of the set nut. 
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the damping element consists of a  

 
rubber block (16, 29), a shock-absorber with return spring or 

the like. 
Device according to one of claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that when using the compression spring (5, 

15, 21) and the damping element (6, 16, 29), the compression 
spring is arranged between the set nut and the damping 

element. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
adjustment means comprise an eccentric or wedge mechanism 

(37) acting upon the spring and/or damping element and 
secured to the pressure rod. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
adjustment means (10') consist of a system for shifting at 

least one of the abutments in the direction of the 
longitudinal axis of the pressure rod. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the pressure rod with the spring and/or damping element 

is accommodated in a tube (22) extending between the 
abutments. 
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
tube (22) extends over one portion only of the length between 

both abutments and the pressure rod is made in the other 
portion as a shift element of the stop seated on the pressure 

rod in longitudinally displaceable relationship and locked 
against rotation in the tube applied onto one abutment. 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
portion of the pressure rod (19) made as the shift element 

has a diameter which corresponds substantially to that of the 
tube. 
Device according to one of claims 1-9, characterized 
by a pressure rod (19) composed of three sections (19', 19'', 

19''') of which one (19') is made as the screw-threaded rod 
and carries the stop made as a screw-threaded sleeve (20), 

the compression spring (21) being seated inside of a tube 
(22) surrounding this section between a tube bottom and the 

stop whereas the middle section (19''), which also lies to a 
large extent inside of the tube (22) and carries a damping  

 
rubber element (29) spreadable by means of another screw-threaded 

sleeve (28) and in that the last section (19''') is 
made as a rotary hand grip for rotating the pressure rod in 

relation to the tube and thus for the adjustment of the 
prestress of the spring. 
Utilization of the device according to one of claims 
1-10 on a snowboard (1), characterized in that such at least 

one device is secured in the region between the bindings on 
the top face of the snowboard. 
Utilization according to claim 11, characterized in 
that several devices (8, 9) are arranged side by side on the 

snowboard. 
Utilization according to claim 12, characterized in 
that the devices are fitted with a spring and/or damping 

element (8', 9'). 
Utilization of the device according to one of claims 
1-10 on skis, characterized in that the device is arranged in 

the vicinity of the binding plate or integrated into the 
latter.
