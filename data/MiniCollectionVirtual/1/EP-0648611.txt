<ABSTRACT>
A method for applying an ink-receiving layer to any given substrate 
comprising the steps of 


i. laminating a sheet or web material comprising at least three 
layers, viz. a temporary support, having a thickness between 40 and 

100 µm, an ink-receiving layer and an adhesive layer onto said given 
substrate 
ii. stripping the temporary support away to free the ink-receiving 
layer. 
The ink-receiving layer, according to the present invention is 
adapted to be used with water-based inks and enables the end-user of 

said image-recording member to transfer that ink-receiving layer to 
any of the substrates of his choice.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for ink-jet printing of 
materials. More particularly the present invention relates to a 
method to provide any given substrate with an ink-receiving layer as 
normally used in ink-jet printing. Ink-jet printing has become a popular printing technique because 
of its convenience, simplicity and low cost. Especially in those 
instances where a limited edition of the printed matter is needed, 
ink-jet printing has become a printing technology of choice. In the ink jet printing technique the individual ink droplets 
can be applied to the receiving substrate in several different ways. 
The ink solution can be jetted continuously through a small nozzle 
towards the receiving layer (Hertz method). The ink droplet can 
also be created "upon demand" by a piezoelectric transducer or a 
thermal push (Bubble Jet). Ink-jet printing can be used both on plain paper substrates and 
on (transparent) polymeric substrates. Applying ink-jet printing techniques on plain paper can be 
achieved with cheap water soluble or water-based inks since these 
inks are readily dried on the plain paper substrate. An other application of ink-jet printing lies in the production 
of transparencies on a transparent polymeric substrate. These 
elements are primarily intended for use on an overhead projector. 
More generally, these elements can be used for all kinds of viewing 
means by transmitted light. Such transparencies can be made by ink-jet printing on a plain 
polymeric substrate when using a hot-melt ink-jet printing 
technique. By this technique a high viscosity ink is melt and 
jetted upon the plain polymer substrate. There the ink readily 
cools down, solidifies and adheres well to the substrate. This 
technique however presents some disadvantages : the solidified ink 
yields small lenses upon the surface of the transparencies which can 
lead to colour changes during projection with directed light. The 
surface irregularities can also lead to scratching and damaging of 
the information contained in the transparencies.  
 These drawbacks are overcome by coating an ink-receiving layer, 
that can be printed with a water-based ink, on to the polymeric 
substrate. Ink-receiving layers used in image-recording members comprising 
a polymeric substrate meeting the necessary different stringent 
requirements for high quality ink-jet printing are disclosed in e.g.
