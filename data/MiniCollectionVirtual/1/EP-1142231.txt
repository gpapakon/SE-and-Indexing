<ABSTRACT>
Messages or other electronic documents that contain content-material and delivery-control information are encoded as a content-only message followed by the delivery-control information. By segregating the content-material from the control information, all applications that are designed to render the content-material can render the content-material independent of the control information that they may or may not be designed to support. In a preferred embodiment, the control information is appended to the content-material, so that a direct display of the initial portion of the message is a rendering of the content-material, free of control information. In the second method, which can be independent or combined with the first method, the control information is encoded using "invisible" characters or sequences, which, when rendered using conventional means for rendering the content-material, produce an effect that is substantially indiscernible to the user. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, unique sequences of "non-visible" characters, such as spaces, tabs, etc. are used to encode the control information. By encoding the control information as a series of invisible characters or sequences, a direct display of the message will appear as a "plain-text" message, because the control information is appended to the plain-text as indiscernible "white space".

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of communications, and in particular to the
encoding of electronic documents, for example, electronic messages, that contain delivery
commands.As methods of encoding information change to allow for greater capabilities
and efficiencies, the likelihood of incompatibility with prior art systems increases. This
incompatibility often occurs because the control information related to the communication of
the electronic document, in particular of a message, is incompatible with different systems.
That is, a text message is typically encoded in an ASCII format that is generally compatible
with most, if not all, display or printing devices, but the control information, on the other
hand, will only be compatible with systems that are designed to be compatible with the
encoding of this control information. For example, the command that instructs an e-mail
system to mark a message as "urgent", or that instructs a pager to periodically "beep" until
the message is responded to, may have unpredictable results on legacy devices that do not
recognize delivery control commands.FIG. 1 illustrates an example prior art encoding 100 of a text message 120
with delivery-control information 110. Consistent with prior art systems, the originator of the
message 120 may have created the message via a voice or text input to a message processing
system (not shown), followed by a selection of options for controlling the delivery of the
message 120. For example, as illustrated by the "Beep: 0,15,90" control 112, the user has
selected the option of beeping the recipient immediately (0), then every 15 seconds
thereafter, and to terminate the beeping after 90 seconds. Similarly, the "Remind: 10,10"
command reminds the recipient that the message has not been responded to, after 10 minutes,
and every 10 minutes thereafter. The message processing system typically creates the
commands 110 based on knowledge of the receiving device 180 of the recipient. The
corresponding receiving device 180, which comprises, for example, a beeper (pager) or
telephone with a text display, a PDA, PC, or other display device, processes the commands, 
and displays the contents of the message 120 on a display device 185. The corresponding
device 180 also recognizes embedded commands, such as the "Caller" command 122
("caller-ID"), and provides the caller's telephone number in a separate display window 182.
The compatibility of the commands 110 in the encoded message 100 to the particular
receiving device 180 is typically
