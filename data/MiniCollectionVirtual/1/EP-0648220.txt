<ABSTRACT>
The preparation of deuterated nucleoside and nucleotide units for RNA and DNA synthesis is described. Preparation of the deuterated sugar residue is also described. The deuterated units are used to synthesize strands of RNA and DNA wherein one unit is non-deuterated, with adjacent units deuterated. The deuteration is sufficiently high in order that resonance from the deuterated units do not overlap with resonances from non-deuterated units in NMR-experiments. Thereby a "NMR"-window is created in the DNA or RNA strands, which can be beneficially used for advanced studies of structure versus biological activity in DNA and RNA.

<DESCRIPTION>
DEUTERATED NUCLEOSIDESThe present invention relates to deuterated nucleosides and nucleotides in a first aspect.The invention also relates to a process for chemical deuteration of furanosides in a second aspect, and to the preparation of deuterated nucleoside and nucleotide units based on said deuterated furanosides in a third aspect.The invention additionally relates to a Raney Nickel catalyst useable for achieving sufficiently efficient deuteration.The invention further relates to the use of said deuterated compounds in N R applications, especially for the study of RNA and DNA by means of a technique designated as NMR-window technique.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe importance of structure and dynamics of DNA and RNA in understanding the biological function has been investigated by a variety of physico-chemical techniques . Amongst these techniques. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful tools1 because it provides conformational information on the implication of variation of local structures and the dynamics under a biological condition. This has been possible due to extensive developments achieved both in hardware (increasing magnetic field, more powerful computers) and spectral editing methodologies (twolf*2/three3a_c or higher3d-dimensional NMR) . With increasing magnetic field, the higher sensitivity reduces the amount of an oligomer needed to obtain a good quality spectrum, and increases the dispersion of resonance signals reducing the spectral complexity due to resonance overlap (from second order J couplings to first order) . Homonuclear two-dimensional (2D) correlated spectroscopy (COSY) provides a direct proof of the existance of resolved scalar or dipolar 

couplings (3JHH) and correlate the chemical shifts of coupling partner through the single or multiple coherence transfer of nuclear spins from one transition to another (as in DQFCOSY) or by the migration of coherences in an oscillatory manner through the entire spin (TOCSY) which visualize the structure of the spin system in a most direct and informative manner2-4. On the other hand, 2D nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOESY)5 result from the transfer of magnetization due to motional processes causing cross relaxation of dipolar-coupled spins which fall off with the sixth power of the distance between two relaxing protons [< r(t)~6 >"1/6_, where r(t) = ensemble of distances due to interconversions of conformations when the NMR measurements were being made) 5b-5e. Thus NMR has the capabilities
