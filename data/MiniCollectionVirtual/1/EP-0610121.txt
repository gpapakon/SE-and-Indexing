<ABSTRACT>
Process for kilning malt, comprising a kiln with superposed floors provided with means for supplying and spreading a malt load on each floor, means of unloading the malt by successive layers and means of ventilating hot air in a stream going across the said load. This process is characterised in that it consists in emptying the entire said load C on at least one upper floor, in causing the drying of this load over only a portion e of its height, in discharging the dried portion C1 of the malt after a determined drying period while leaving the remaining non-dried portion C on this upper floor, in discharging the said dried portion C1 onto a lower floor and in bringing about the kilning of this dried portion C1 on this lower floor while, on the said upper floor, the drying of the said remaining portion C2 of the said load continues at the same time.
