Coextruded product comprising an outer envelope having
a uniform thickness and an inner liquid, semi-liquid or

powdered filling, wherein the outer envelope based on
textured meat or fish has a moisture content comprised

between 20 and 40 % by weight and additionally contains
phosphoric acid, an additive to lower the water activity to

a content comprised between 3 and 5 % by weight, an anti-mould
product and an antioxidant, and the filling

represents between 30 and 40 % of the total volume and
consists of a mixture based on a product chosen from animal

fat having a melting point of 35°C, vegetable fat having a
melting point of 35°C and powdered yeast.
Coextruded product according to claim 1, characterized
in that the outer envelope additionally contains cereal or

starch flour.
Coextruded product according to either of claims 1 or
2, characterized in that the filling contains soya oil.
Coextruded product according to claim 3, characterized
in that the filling contains between 5 and 20 % by weight

of yeast.
Coextruded product according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the filling is a powder, chosen from

amongst the following constituents: sugar, yeast, milk
powder, vitamins and mineral elements.
Coextruded product according to any one of claims 1 to
5, characterized in that in the outer envelope textured

meat or fish represents between 40 and 60 % by weight,
cereal or starch flour between 30 and 45 % by weight,

phosphoric acid and the additive for lowering the water
activity between 3 and 5 % by weight, the anti-mould

product between 0.5 and 1 % by weight and the antioxidant
between 0.1 and 0.2 % by weight. 
Process for obtaining a coextruded product according to
any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the outer envelope is

extruded at a temperature comprised between 120 and 200°C
and the filling is delivered to the outlet from the

extrusion die so as to form a coextruded rope which then
passes into a forming unit for carrying out moulding at a

temperature of the order of 70°C over a period of the order
of a second by a pressure roller and the product obtained

is air cooled to a temperature comprised between 20 and
70°C, the forming unit being of the type comprising an

outer ring equipped with dies, eccentrically positioned
with respect to a crown body also equipped with a die, both

being mounted for rotation and driven by a single motor.
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that the
components of the outer envelope are mixed in the extruder.
Process according to either of claims 7 or 8,
characterized in that a throughput of 150 to 600 kg/h is

used together with a rate of travel of the coextruded rope
of the order of 10-40 m/min.
