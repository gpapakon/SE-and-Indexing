<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an abutment for supporting hollow profiles (1) while corner angles (2,3) arranged in the hollow chambers of the said profiles (1) are joined to the said profiles (1) by the exertion of pressure, the abutment comprising an abutment block (6) with a holding device (7,8) for interchangeably arranged abutment inserts (9,10). To allow a plurality of corner angles (2,3) to be joined by the exertion of pressure to the respective profile (1) using standard abutment inserts, even when there is an offset between the bearing surfaces of the profiles (1) for the abutment inserts (9,10), the invention proposes that the abutment block (6) should have at least two holding devices (7,8), these being arranged in such a way as to be hydraulically adjustable in the longitudinal direction (100,101). Those ends of the two holding devices (7,8) which face away from the abutment inserts (9,10) are advantageously each designed directly as piston-shaped parts (11,12) and arranged displaceably in corresponding recesses (cylinders) (15,16) of the abutment block (6), the cylinder spaces (17,18) not taken up by the piston-shaped parts (11,12) each being filled with a hydraulic fluid (19).

Abutment for the supporting of hollow section pieces 
(1) on connecting these section pieces (1) by means of 

punching tools (4,5) with corner angles (2,3) arranged in 
the hollow chambers of the section pieces (1), in which the 

abutment has an abutment block (6), characterised in that 

a) the hollow section pieces (1) have several corner 
angles (2,3) staggered with respect to each other 

perpendicularly to the surface in which the hollow section 
pieces (1) lie, 
b) the abutment block (6) has at least two receiving 
devices (7,8), staggered with respect to each other 

perpendicularly to the surface in which the hollow section 
pieces lie, for interchangeably arranged abutment inserts 

(9,10), which receiving devices are arranged so as to be 
hydraulically adjustable in their longitudinal direction 

(100,101), 
c) the receiving devices (7,8) are displaceable relative 
to each other parallel to the surface in which the hollow 

section pieces (10) lie, 
d) the ends of the two receiving devices (7,8) facing 
away from the abutment inserts (9,10) are in each case 

constructed as piston-shaped members (11,12) which are 
arranged so as to be displaceable into corresponding 

cylinders (15,16) of the abutment block (6), and 
e) the cylinder chambers (17,18) not made use of by the 
piston-shaped members (11, 12) are in each case filled with 

a hydraulic fluid (1 9). 
Abutment according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the cylinder chambers (17,18) not made use of by the 

piston-shaped members (11,12) are connected with each other 
by an opening (20) for pressure equalization. 
Abutment according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that bracing pieces (13,14) adjoin the piston-shaped 

members (11,12) of the receiving device (7,8) to receive 
the abutment inserts (9,10), and that the abutment inserts 

(9,10) are arranged on the bracing pieces (13,14) so as to 
be adjustable perpendicularly to the longitudinal axes 

(100,101) of the receiving devices (7,8). 
Abutment according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the bracing pieces (13,14) on the sides facing the abutment 

inserts (9,10) in each case have a rail-shaped member (25) 
along which the respective abutment insert (9,10), provided 

with a corresponding groove-shaped recess (26), is 
displaceably arranged. 
Abutment according to one of Claims 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the bracing pieces (13,14) of the 

receiving devices (7,8) are connected with two guide 
pistons (31,32) which are arranged so as to be displaceable 

in corresponding recesses (33,34) of the abutment block (6) 
and symmetrically to the piston-shaped member (11,12). 
Abutment according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
cha
racterised in that the abutment block (6) is arranged so 
as to be adjustable in a corner connecting machine in the 

direction of the longitudinal axes (100,101) of the 
receiving devices (7,8). 
Abutment according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the receiving devices (7,8) are able 

to be arrested in relation to each other with a stop (35).  
 
Abutment according to one of Claims 1 and/or 3 to 7, 
characterised n that at least one of the cylinder chambers 

(17,18) filled with hydraulic fluid (19) is connected via 
an opening (23,24) with a pressure source.
