Feed pump (11), in particular for paints and other media, consisting of a 
cylinder (12) which can be inserted into a supply container (2) and 

which is provided with an inlet valve (18) and an outlet valve (19) and 
consisting of a pump piston (14) which is installed inside the cylinder 

(12) and which can be driven by means of a motor (41) through the 
intermediary of, for example, an eccentric (44) or a crank assembly, in 

which the medium being pumped can be supplied to an outlet pipe (20) 
through a riser pipe (21) which is connected to the valve housing (17) 

inside which the outlet valve (19) is located,
characterised in that
,
 
the riser pipe (21, 21') is made out of two or more sections (22, 23 or 

22', 23') which can be adjusted to occupy different positions in relation 
to one another in order to modify the length of the riser pipe (21, 21'), in 

which the sections (22, 23 or 22', 23') can be clipped together in 
differing height positions, or that the riser pipe (21") is made out of two 

sections (22", 23") which can be clipped inside each other and thus 
interlocked, in which at least one of the sections (22", 23") is of a 

different length as required.  
 
The feed pump in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that,
 
the sections of the riser pipe (21, 21') are made out of pipes (22, 23 or 

22', 23') which are lined up with one another, which can be clipped into 
one another, and which are fitted on the valve housing (17) of the outlet 

valve (19) and the outlet pipe (20). 
The feed pump in accordance with Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that,
 
in order to fix the position of the pipes (22, 23 or 22', 23'), a flexibly 

deformable positioning lever (25, 25') which extends in the direction of 
the riser pipe (21, 21') is fitted onto the valve housing (17) of the outlet 

valve (19) or onto the outlet pipe (20), with the side of the positioning 
lever (25, 25') which faces the pipes (22, 23 or 22', 23') being provided 

with a clip-in projection (26) which engages with the notches (28, 28', 
28") formed at various heights along the outer surface of one of the 

pipes (23 or 22'). 
The feed pump in accordance with Claim 3,
characterised in that,
 
the positioning lever (25, 25') is provided with an integrated handle (27) 

formed at an angle and located on the opposite side of the positioning 
lever (25, 25') to the clip-in projection (26).  

 
The feed pump in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that,
 
the pipes (22, 23 or 22', 23') which form the riser pipe (21, 21') are 

movably fitted one inside another in such a way that the pipes (22, 23 or 
22', 23') are torsionally fixed, for example by means of a bar (29) which 

protrudes from the cylinder (12) and engages in a longitudinal groove 
(30) formed into the outer surface of the pipe (23) which is attached to 

the outlet pipe (20). 
The feed pump in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that,
 
in order to compensate for a modification in length of the riser pipe (21, 

21') the piston rod (15) attached to the pump piston (14) can be 
connected to the drive element (44) of the motor (41) at various height 

positions (16, 16', 16"), or can be replaced by a piston rod which 
compensates for the modification in length of the riser pipe (21, 21'). 
The feed pump in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that,
  
 

the outlet pipe (20), the riser pipe (21) and the cylinder (12) which is 
firmly connected to the valve housing (17) of the outlet valve (19) as 

well as the pump piston (14) which is inserted in the cylinder (12) are all 
fixed to the supply container (2) by means of a cover (31), plate or 

similar provided on the outlet pipe (20), in which the components which 
are connected can be exchanged, for example by means of a collar 

(32). 
The feed pump in accordance with Claim 7,
characterised in that,
 
the cover (31) or the plate is provided with a guide piece (33) for the 

piston rod (15) which is connected to the pump piston (14). 
The feed pump in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that,
 
a removable filter (45) is fitted onto the cylinder (12) in the direction of 

travel of the pump piston (14), in which in a preferable embodiment, the 
connection is produced as a bayonet connection (46). 
The feed pump in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that,
 
the outlet pipe (20) with its attached cover (31), the components of the 

riser pipe (21) and the cylinder (12) with its attached valve housing (17) 
are manufactured from an impact-resistant plastic material.
