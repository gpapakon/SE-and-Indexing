<ABSTRACT>
It includes an elastic clamp (15) having the general shape of a dish or bell, including radial slots (18) in its peripheral part and means (21) for centring with respect to the driveshaft (2). The lateral sections of this clamp (15) move radially with respect to the axis of the clamp when the central part (16) thereof is moved along this axis.

A device for removably clamping a grinding disk (4) to a drive
shaft (2) of a grinding unit of a vehicle for reprofiling the rails of

a railway track, characterized in that it includes a resilient clamp
(15) exhibiting the general shape of a cup or of a bell having radial

slots (18) in the peripheral part thereof, defining radial sectors,
each radial sector having a cylindrical peripheral rim (17) having on

its proximal face an annular bearing face; in that said cylindrical rim
(17) extends substantially perpendicularly to the plane of the bottom

(16) of the clamp, the inner surfaces of said rims (17) defining together
a clamping surface designed for cooperating with the peripheral

surface of a grinding disk (4) to be clamped thereby; means (21, 22)
for ensuring the centering relative to the drive shaft (2); the lateral

segments (17) of this clamp (15) moving radially with respect to the
axis of the clamp, when the central part (16) thereof is moved along

this axis.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the bottom
(16) of the clamp (15) has a central opening (21) surrounded by a solid

annular part; and in that it includes means (22, 24) making possible,
on the one hand, the fastening of this clamp (15) to the drive shaft

(2) and, on the other hand, the axial displacement of the solid annular
bottom part (16) of the clamp relative to the plane of the annular bearing

surface of the peripheral rim (17) of this clamp, between a release
position of the grinding disk (4) and a clamping position thereof

by said rims (17) of the sectors of the clamp (15).
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that the 
means for fastening the clamp on the drive shaft include a wheel (5),

of which the distal face includes radial ribs or studs (14) engaged in
the radial slots (18) separating the radial sectors (17) of the clamp,

this distal face including, amongst others, a peripheral bearing rim
(12) and a central recess allowing axial displacements of the central

part (16) of the clamp when the same rests through its periphery
against the peripheral bearing rim (12) of the wheel (5).
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the wheel (5)
is connected rigidly, both axially and angularly, to the drive shaft

(2).
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the solid central
annular part of the clamp is connected by a control and fastening

member, to the drive shaft.
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that the control
and fastening member is comprised of a pivot (22) with a shoulder,

slidable in the wheel (5), and bearing upon the solid central annular
part of the clamp (15), and of a bolt (24) connecting this pivot (22)

to the shaft (2) of the motor (1).
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that the control
and fastening member is comprised of a pivot (22) with a shoulder, slidable

in the wheel (5), and bearing upon the solid central annular part
of the clamp (15), and of a control rod slidable inside the drive shaft

of which the end is affixed to this pivot.
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the wheel is
comprised of two parts (30, 3
6) defining between them a recess separated 
into two chambers by a piston (39) of which the rod extends outwardly

from the distal face of the wheel and is connected to the solid
central annular part of the clamp (15).'
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that the chamber
situated between the piston (39) and the cover (36) of the wheel encloses

resilient means (44) acting to separate these two pieces one from
the other, thus producing the clamping action of the clamp (15)
A device according to claim 9, characterized in that the other
chamber (40), situated between the piston (39) and the hub or the base

(38) of the wheel, is connected to a source of pressurized fluid enabling
the control of the motion of the piston (39) inside the wheel

(30, 36) for releasing the clamp (15).
A device according to one of claims 9 or 10, characterized in that
the resilient means (44) are comprised either of stacked spring washers

or of coil springs.
