<ABSTRACT>
Transport device for flat objects (20), for transferring, towards means for sorting flat objects, particularly flat objects of variable thickness, exiting an apparatus for separating flat objects (10). This transport device comprises means (21, 22) for pinching a flat object (1) initially located in a transfer plane (P), these means being arranged so as to be displaced in a direction (D) substantially perpendicular to the transfer plane. The pinching means (21, 22) are controlled in order to immobilise the said flat object (1) to await an authorisation for transfer towards the sorting means. Use for automatic sorting of mail.

<CLAIMS>
Device (20) for transferring flat objects to sorting means from
the output of a device (10) for unstacking flat objects, the device

comprising means (21, 22) for gripping a flat object (1) initially
located in a transfer plane (P), said means (21, 22) comprising two

pinch rollers (21, 22) having a soft material on their outside (21a,
22a) and at least one of which is mobile n a displacement plane (D)

perpendicular to said transfer plane (P), the device being
characterized in that it comprises for each roller (21, 22), a set of

drive belts (27, 30; 28, 29) stretched around said roller (21, 22)
and two pulleywheels (23, 24, 25, 35) on opposite sides of said

roller (21, 22), in that said gripping means (21, 22) are controlled
in such a way as to immobilize said flat object (1) pending

authorization for its transfer to the sorting means, and in that it
further comprises double pick separator means (11) disposed between

two levels of belts of one of the pinch rollers (21, 22).
Transfer device (20) according to claim 1 characterized in that
it comprises drive means for driving the pinch rollers (21, 22), said

drive means being controlled in such a way as to immobilize a flat
object (1) pending authorization for its transfer and to drive and

transfer said flat object (1) after receiving such authorization.
Device (10) for unstacking flat objects comprising flat object
feed means (13), holding means (16), double pick separator means (11)

and a flat object transfer device (20) according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the flat object transfer

device (20) comprises means (21, 22) for gripping a flat object (1)
previously driven by the holding means (16), said gripping means (21,

22) being controlled in such a way that said flat object (1) is
transferred by said transfer device after a transfer authorization is

received.
Unstacking device (10) according to claim 3 characterized in
that the double pick separator means (11) are in the immediate

vicinity of the upstream side of the pinch rollers (21, 22). 
Unstacking device (10) according to claim 3 or claim 4
characterized in that the transfer device (20) has a flat object

transfer plane substantially parallel to the holding plane of the
holding means (16).
