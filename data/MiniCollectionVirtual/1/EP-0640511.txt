<ABSTRACT>
A car stereo system is provided having a stereo body (10) 
including a connector member (12). A removable panel (20) 

has a plug member (21) which cooperates with the connector 
member (12). A plurality of separators (30) are formed on 

the connector member (12) for separating contacts (12a - 12d) 
provided on said connector member so as to render 

these contacts to be spaced apart from one another. A 
plurality of grooves (40) are formed on the plug member 

(21) into which the separators (30) on the connector member 
are inserted. The contacts (12a - 12d) provided on the 

connector member (12) and contacts (21a - 21d) provided on 
the plug member (21) are adapted to be electrically 

connected upon engagement of the separators (30) of the 
connector member with the grooves (40) of the plug member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a car stereo system 
generally provided on the dashboard of a motor vehicle, 
more particularly to a car stereo system having a 
detachable panel. With an increase in the use of sophisticated car stereo 
systems in recent years, there has been increased theft of 
the stereos. Such theft supposedly has been due to the 
distinct front appearance having various operation 
pushbuttons which enables a thief to quickly recognize the 
existence of a car stereo. In order to prevent theft of a 
car stereo from increasing, car stereo systems having a 
detachable panel have been developed and become 
commercially available. If a car driver removes the panel 
from the stereo body when leaving his car, the theft may be 
prevented since it is difficult to know whether a stereo is 
provided on the dashboard. Fig. 9 shows a conventional car stereo, wherein a panel 20 
having various operating pushbuttons is detachable from a 
stereo body 10. As shown in Fig. 9, the stereo body 10 has 
a recess 11 into which the panel 20 is mounted. The recess 
11 is provided with a connector member 12 on the right hand 
side thereof, an elongated cassette opening 14 at a nearly 
central portion thereof, and a detecting switch 15 on the 
left side of the opening 14. The detecting switch 15 is 
provided to detect whether or not the panel 20 is mounted 
on the stereo body 10. Also, as shown in Fig 9, the panel 20 has, on the front 
face thereof, a series of operating pushbuttons 22, and a 
display 23 for indicating various information such as time  
 
and radio receiving frequency. On the upper portion of the 
front face of the panel 20, there is provided an elongated 
cassette opening 24 corresponding to and communicating with 
the elongated opening 14 formed in the recess 11 of the 
stereo body 10. Fig. 10 shows the inner structures of the panel 20 and the 
stereo body 10 respectively and the electrical relationship 
between these two. As shown in Fig. 10, the connector 
member 12 is provided with various contacts including a 
contact 12a for obtaining 5V electric power supply, a 
contact 12b for data input and output, a contact 12c for 
obtaining 8V electric power supply, and an earth contact 
12d. The contact 12a is connected to 5V electric power 
supply circuit 17, and the contact 12c is connected to 8V 
electric power supply circuit 18. The contact 12b is 
connected to a micro-computer 19. Also, as shown in Fig. 11, a plug member 21 is provided on 
the rear face of the panel 20 which is to be
