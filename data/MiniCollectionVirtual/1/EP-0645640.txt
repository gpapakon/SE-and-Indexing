<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic resonance 
apparatus to generate magnetic resonance such as nuclear 
magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance, and particularly 
to a magnetic field sweeping apparatus capable of 
dealing with chemical shift which takes place during the 
magnetic resonance. In magnetic resonance such as nuclear magnetic resonance 
or electron spin resonance wherein a specimen material 
undergoes resonance and absorbs electromagnetic radiation 
energy upon application of a high frequency electromagnetic 
field which corresponds to the energy difference between two 
energy levels of atoms constituting the specimen placed in a 
static magnetic field, measurement of the frequency where 
the atom absorbs the radiation or the spectrum of absorbed 
radiation provides information on the electron density of 
the atom and the bond between atoms. This phenomenon of 
magnetic resonance has been utilized in the researches on 
the properties of inorganic materials and researches on  
 
radicals of organic compounds, making great contributions to 
the recent advancements in such fields as solid state physics, 
complex chemistry, organic electron research, radiation 
chemistry, photochemistry and electrochemistry. A mechanism to increase a function of separating impurities 
included in water and thereby to improve the purifying 
function by causing magnetic resonance in hydrogen atoms 
of water which is a compound of hydrogen, thereby to increase 
the energy level and acting on hydrogen bond or 
covalent bond, and an attempt to improve combustion efficiency 
by causing magnetic resonance in hydrogen atoms of 
hydrocarbon which is a covalently bonded molecule thereby to 
increase the energy level and accelerate the dissociation of 
hydrocarbon molecules have been proposed by the present 
applicant. As for the nuclear magnetic resonance, for example, it 
has been known that a hydrogen nucleus placed in a static 
magnetic field of 14,092 gauss [G] shows nuclear magnetic 
resonance in response to the application of a high frequency 
electromagnetic field of 60 mega hertz [MHz], since American 
physicist Dr. Rabi published his discovery in 1932. Intensity 
G of the static magnetic field and frequency N of the 
high frequency electromagnetic radiation which cause the 
nuclear magnetic resonance in hydrogen nuclei are associated 
by the following relationship.

 G/g=N 


 
where G: Intensity of static magnetic field [G]
 
g: Resonance constant (234.87 for hydrogen) [G/MHz]
 
N: Frequency of
