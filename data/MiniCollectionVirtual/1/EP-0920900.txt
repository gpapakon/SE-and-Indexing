<ABSTRACT>
In a VOC concentrating apparatus using a honeycomb
rotor, in order to lower further concentration at an exit of

adsorption and at the same time to be able to regulate amount
of air flow introduced into a desorbing zone, independently

from amount of cooling air, there are disposed a cooling
zone, desorbing zone and an adsorbing zone and the honeycomb

rotor is rotated so that it passes through these zones one
after another. After gas to be treated has passed through

the adsorbing zone, concentration of VOC in the gas is
measured on the exit side by means of a concentration

detector.
The cooling air is divided by a damper for regulating
amount of air flow, after having entered the cooling zone,

and a part thereof enters the desorbing zone through a
heater. Further air coming out therefrom is heated again by

a heater to enter the desorbing zone and concentrated gas is
taken out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas treating apparatus used for recovering, for example, solvents by concentrating volatile organic compounds by means of a rotary honeycomb rotor.Fig. 3 shows a gas treating apparatus adopted heretofore as a rotating type apparatus for concentrating volatile organic compounds (hereinbelow abbreviated to VOC). A honeycomb rotor 31, which is a construction for treating gas in the concentrating apparatus, consists of a conventional honeycomb construction carrying an adsorber, which can adsorb VOC with a high efficiency. The rotor 31 is rotated continuously with a constant speed by a driving motor (not shown). On all of the peripheral surface of the honeycomb rotor 31 there are disposed an adsorbing zone 32, a desorbing zone 33, which desorbs adsorbed VOC to recover adsorbing capacity of the honeycomb rotor, and a cooling zone 34, which cools the honeycomb rotor heated in the desorbing zone 33, separated from each other.Consequently, the honeycomb rotor 31 is moved by rotation so that it passes through the adsorbing zone 32, the desorbing zone 33 and the cooling zone 34 one after another in this order.Concentration of VOC is effected as follows. Gas to be treated is introduced into the adsorbing zone 32 and VOC contained in the gas to be treated is adsorbed by the adsorber disposed on the honeycomb rotor 31. By this process the gas to be treated is transformed into clean gas, which is released-into the atmosphere. The adsorber, which has adsorbed VOC, in the adsorbing zone 32, which has adsorbed VOC, is moved to the desorbing zone 33, as the honeycomb rotor rotates. In the desorbing zone 33, hot air heated by a heater 35 passes therethrough so that VOC adsorbed by the adsorber is desorbed by the hot air. The VOC thus desorbed forms a concentrated gas and solvent is recovered. Fig. 5 shows a solvent recovery equipment using such a concentrating apparatus as described above.Since the honeycomb rotor 31 is heated by hot air in the desorbing zone 33, the adsorbing capacity of the adsorber disposed on the rotor decreases. In order to recover the adsorbing capacity of the adsorber, the adsorber, which has been in the desorbing zone 33, is moved to the cooling zone 34 as the honeycomb rotor 31 rotates. After having cooled the adsorber by passing air from the atmosphere through the honeycomb rotor 31, the adsorber, which has been in the cooling zone 34, is moved again to the adsorbing zone 32 as the honeycomb rotor 31 rotates.In the apparatus, air effecting desorption and air
