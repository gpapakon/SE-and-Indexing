<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new pharmaceutical use of 1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, 10, 10a - 
octahydro-benzo[g]quinoline derivatives. More particularly the present invention relates to a new pharmaceutical use for compounds of 
formula I 
wherein
 
the rings A and B are trans-fused and wherein
 
R₁ and R₂ are each independently hydrogen, hydroxy or methoxy, with the proviso that R₁ 
and R₂ may not both be hydrogen;
 
R₃ is hydrogen or C₁₋₄alkyl;
 
R₄ is -COOH, -CH₂OR₅, -CH₂CN, -CON(R₆)R₇, -CH₂SR₈, -NHSO₂N(R₉)R₁₀ or 
-NH-CON(R₉)R₁₀,
 
R₅ is hydrogen or C₁₋₃alkyl,
 
R₆ is hydrogen or C₁₋₃alkyl and
 
R₇ is hydrogen, C₁₋₃alkyl, phenyl or pyridyl, said phenyl or pyridyl being optionally 
substituted by halogen, methyl or methoxy or
 
R₆ and R₇ together are -(CH₂)₄-, -(CH₂)₅- or -(CH₂)₂-O-(CH₂)₂-,
 
R₈ is C₁₋₄alkyl or pyridyl, said pyridyl being optionally substituted by halogen, methyl or 
methoxy, and
 
R₉ and R₁₀ are each independently hydrogen or C₁₋₃alkyl or together are -(CH₂)₄- or -(CH₂)₅-, 
as well as the physiologically-hydrolysable and -acceptable esters thereof.  The compounds of formula I exist in free and in salt form, e.g. as acid addition salts or, when 
e.g. R₄ is carboxy, as internal salts. The compounds of formula I as well as the physiologically-hydrolysable and -acceptable 
esters thereof, in free or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, are hereinafter referred to 
as "the compounds". It will be understood that the compounds include all possible individual isomers as well as 
racemates and other isomeric mixtures. The compounds as well as their production process are known e.g. from U.S.Patent No. 
4,565,818. This patent also discloses the use of the compounds as prolactin secretion 
inhibiting agents e.g. in the treatment of conditions or disorders for which reduction of 
prolactin secretion levels is indicated, furthermore as dopaminergic agents e.g. in the 
treatment of Morbus Parkinson and as dopamine receptor stimulating agents e.g. in the 
treatment or prophylaxis of coronary diseases. The compounds also include the (-)-(3β, 4aα, 10aβ)-1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 
5,10,10a-octahydro-3-[(2-pyridylthio)methyl]-1-methyl-6-hydroxy-benzo[g]quinoline 
which is of formula I but is not 
specifically disclosed in the above mentioned U.S. patent. This compound (hereinafter referred 
to as compound A) in free form or acid addition salt form as well as its production process 
are known e.g. from U.S. Patent No. 5,262,422. This patent discloses the use of compound A 
in the treatment of glaucoma, Morbus
