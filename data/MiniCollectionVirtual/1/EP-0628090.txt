<ABSTRACT>
A superalloy turbine blade (10) has a MCrA1Y bond coating (22) and a thermal barrier coating (24). The thermal barrier coating (24) comprises a plurality of alternate layers (25, 27) which have different structure to produce a plurality of interfaces (26) substantially parallel to the metallic substrate (20)/bond coating (22) interface. These interfaces (26) provide paths of increased resistance to heat transfer to reduce the thermal conductivity of the thermal barrier coating (24). The structure in the alternate layers (25, 27) of the thermal barrier coating (24) is columnar (28), or segmented, to ensure that the strain tolerance of the thermal barrier coating (24) is not impaired. The columnar grains (28) in the layers (25, 27) extend substantially perpendicular to the metallic substrate (20)/bond coating (22) interface. This enables thermal barrier coatings (24) of reduced thickness and weight to be used. The bond coating may have an oxide or oxide/metal interface which improves the adhesion of the thermal barrier coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with coatings for 
metallic substrates, and is particularly concerned with 
ceramic thermal barrier coatings for metallic components 
for use in gas turbine engines. It is known in the prior art to apply ceramic to a 
metallic substrate to produce a ceramic thermal barrier 
coating by the thermal, or plasma, spray process. In this 
technique the ceramic is applied onto a bond coat, for 
example a MCrAlY bond coat, which has been applied to the 
metallic substrate. It is also known in the prior art to apply ceramic 
to a metallic substrate to produce a ceramic thermal 
barrier coating by the physical vapour deposition (PVD) 
process. In this technique the ceramic is applied onto a 
bond coat, for example a MCrAlY coating with an alumina 
interface layer, which has been applied to the metallic 
substrate. The ceramic thermal barrier coatings deposited 
by the PVD process have benefits over the ceramic thermal 
barrier coatings deposited by a thermal spray process. 
The main benefit is improved thermal shock resistance due 
to the columnar structure of the ceramic thermal barrier 
coating produced by the PVD process. Other benefits are 
improved erosion resistance and improved aerothermal 
performance. However, despite these advantages, the ceramic 
thermal barrier coating deposited by the PVD process 
exhibits a thermal conductivity which is greater than 
that of a ceramic thermal barrier coating, of the same or 
similar composition, deposited by the thermal spray 
process. For example the thermal conductivity of a 
zirconia-8% yttria ceramic thermal barrier coating 
deposited by the PVD process is 2.0 W/m/K and the thermal 
conductivity for the same ceramic thermal barrier coating 
deposited by the thermal spray process is 0.8-1.0 W/m/K. 
If all other factors are the same for the two methods of 
deposition of the ceramic thermal barrier coating, the  
 
greater thermal conductivity of the ceramic thermal 
barrier coating deposited by the PVD process means that a 
greater thickness of ceramic is required to achieve the 
equivalent insulating effect when compared to the ceramic 
thermal barrier coating deposited by the thermal spray 
process. This is an undesirable property because this 
necessitates a greater weight of ceramic thermal barrier 
coating on the metallic components of the gas turbine 
engine, and this is particularly undesirable for rotating 
components e.g. turbine blades because the additional 
weight may limit the temperature of operation due to a 
corresp
