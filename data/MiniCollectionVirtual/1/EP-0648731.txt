<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the hydroxycarbonylation of butadiene and/or of its derivatives to pentenoic acids, by reaction with carbon monoxide and water. More precisely, it consists of a process for the hydroxycarbonylation of butadiene and of its derivatives by carbon monoxide and water, at a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure and in the presence of a palladium catalyst which is soluble in the reaction mixture, characterised in that:   - the reaction is carried out in the presence of crotyl chloride, in a proportion of at least two mol per mole of palladium,   - the palladium is found in  pi -crotyl complex form, - the water present in the reaction mixture represents an amount less than or equal to 20 % by weight with respect to the weight of the reaction mixture.   The pentenoic acids lead by hydroxycarbonylation to adipic acid which is one of the base compounds in the preparation of polyamides-6,6.
