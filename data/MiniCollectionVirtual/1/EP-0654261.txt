<ABSTRACT>
Therapeutic or hygienic solid mucoadhesive composition for human or veterinary use, intended to be administered by application on the buccal or nasal mucosa, this composition comprising, in the form of a mixture, a cellulosic mixture gelable in the presence of an aqueous fluid, a homopolymer or a copolymer of acrylic acid or a physiologically acceptable salt of this homopolymer or copolymer and at least one therapeutic or hygienic active ingredient, characterised in that it comprises, as cellulosic ether, 15 to 25 % by weight of at least one element chosen from the group consisting of C1-C4 alkyl ethers of cellulose, C1-C4 hydroxyalkyl ethers of cellulose and mixtures thereof and 10 to 15 % by weight of the said homopolymer, copolymer or salt and in that it comprises, in addition, 30 to 45 % by weight of gelatin.

<CLAIMS>
Solid mucoadhesive therapeutic or hygienic composition, for
human or veterinary use, intended to be administered by

application to the buccal or nasal mucous membrane, this
composition comprising, in a mixt
ure, a cellulosic ether
gelifiable in the presence of an aqueous liquid, a homopolymer

or copolymer of acrylic acid or a physiologically acceptable
salt of that homopolymer or copolymer, and at least one

therapeutic or hygienic active constituent, 
characterized in
that
 it comprises, as cellulosic ether, 15 to 25 % by weight of
an element selected from the group constituted by C
1
-C
4
 alkyle
ethers of cellulose, C
1
-C
4
 hydroxyalkyl ethers of cellulose and
their mixtures, and 10 to 15 % by weight of the said

homopolymer, copolymer or salt, 
in that
 it also comprises 30 to
45 % by weight of gelatin and 
in that
 the particle size of said
homopolymer, copolymer and salt is less than that of the

gelatin and is less than or equal to 20 µm.
Composition according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
gelatin is a gelatin of the type A, which, in a 6.67 % (w/v)

aqueous solution, has a gel strength of 50 to 300 degrees
Bloom.
Composition according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

the gelatin has a particle size of less than 250 µm, and 
in
that
 the polymer or copolymer of acrylic acid or the salt of
this polymer or copolymer has a particle size of 3 to 20 µm.
Composition according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
cellulosic ether is a hydroxypropyl cellulose or a

hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose.
Composition according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the
cellulosic ether has a viscosity measured at 20° C in a 2 %

(w/v) aqueous solution of 10 to 75,000 mPa.s. 
Composition according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in
that
 the cellulosic ether has a particle size of less than
500 µm.
Composition according to claim 1, 2 or 4, 
characterised in
that
 the copolymer of acrylic acid is a copolymer of acrylic
acid and allyl sucrose.
Composition according to claim 7, 
characterised in that

the copolymer of acrylic acid and allyl sucrose has a
viscosity measured at 25°C in a 0.5 % (w/v) aqueous solution

of 300 to 400 mPa.s.
Composition according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 it
is in the form of tablets obtained by compression, this

latter stage being preceded by a granulation stage by means
of an organic non-aqueous solvent.
