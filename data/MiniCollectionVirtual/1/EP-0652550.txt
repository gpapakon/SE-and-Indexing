Magnetic reading head comprising a magnetic
circuit having two pole pieces (90
1
, 90
2
) separated by a
first head gap (100) and a longitudinal magneto resistant

element (50), said head being characterized in that it also
comprises two magnetic layers (30
1
, 30
2
) in contact with
the pole pieces (90
1
, 90
2
) and spaced from one another by a
second head gap (32) located beneath the first (100), said

magnetic layers (30
1
, 30
2
) having a width which decreases
on approaching the second head gap (32) and thus forming a

magnetic field concentrator, the longitudinal magnetoresistant
element (50) being placed across said second head

gap (32) and being made from a multilayer material
constituted by a stack of magnetic layers separated by nonmagnetic

metal layers.
Magnetic read head according to claim 1,
characterized in that the magnetoresistant element (50) is

bent on itself and formed from several parallel, longitudinal
portions (a, b, c, d, e), arranged in juxtaposed

manner across the second head gap (32) and transverse
portions (A, B, C, D).
Magnetic head according to claim 2, characterized
in that the transverse portions (A, B, C, D) are shortcircuited

by conductors (81, 82, 83, 84).
Magnetic head according to claim 1, characterized
in that it also comprises an electrical conductor (80) able

to longitudinally polarize the magnetoresistant element
(50).
Magnetic read head according to claim 4,
characterized in that the material of the polarization conductor

(80) is the same as the material of the conductors
(81, 82, 83, 84) short-circuiting the longitudinal portions

(a, b, c, d, e) of the magnetoresistant element (50).
Magnetic read head according to claim 1,
characterized in that the magnetoresistant element (50) has 

two ends connected by two conductive strips (31, 37) to two external elements
(21, 27).
Magnetic read head according to claim 4, characterized in that the electrical
polarization conductor (80) has two ends connected by two conductive

strips (33, 35) to two external elements (23, 25).
Magnetic head according to any one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that it also comprises a lower magnetic piece (14, 16
1
, 16
2
) magnetically
coupled to the two pole pieces (90
1
, 90
2
) and a conductor coil (18) surrounding
a portion (16
1
, 16
2
) of the magnetic circuit, so that the head operates
both in reading and writing.
Process for producing a magnetic read head according to claim 1, characterized
in that it comprises the following operations:


on a substrate (20, 16
1
, 16
2
) is deposited a magnetic material layer,
which is etched in order to form two layers (30
1
, 30
2
) spaced from one
another by a head gap (32), said layers having a width decreasing on

approaching the head gap (32),
on the assembly is deposited a first insulating layer (34),
a metal layer is deposited and etched in order to form four internal
conductor elements (41, 43, 45, 47) connected by four conductive strips

(31, 33, 35, 37) to four external elements (21, 23, 25, 27),
a multilayer magnetoresistant material layer is deposited and said layer
is etched in order to form a magnetoresistant element, said element having

two ends in contact with two first internal elements (41, 47),
a second insulating layer (52) is deposited,
said second insulating layer (52) is etched in order to free two other
internal elements (43, 45),
a conductive layer is deposited and etched to leave a ribbon (80) having
two ends (73, 75) in contact with the two other internal elements (43, 45),

said ribbon (80) extending across the magnetoresistant element (50), 
on the assembly are formed two pole pieces (90
1
, 90

pole pieces being separated by a head gap (100).
Process according to claim 9, characterized in
that a magnetoresistant element is produced in the form of

layer (52), not only are the two other internal elements
(43, 45) freed, but also the transverse portions (A, B, C,

D) of the magnetoresistant element (50), so that in the
operation of depositing the conductive layer, formation

takes place of transverse conductors (81, 82, 83, 84) on
