<ABSTRACT>
A suspension arm has a rigidity in the side 
direction of the vehicle but has a flexibility in the 

longitudinal direction. The suspension arm has a wheel-side 
connecting member (2) connected to a portion of a 

wheel, at least one vehicle-side connecting member (3, 4) 
connected to a portion of a vehicle body, and an arm 

member (6, 7) extending between the wheel-side connecting 
member (2) and the vehicle-side connecting member (3). A 

width of a center portion (61, 71) of the arm member (6, 
7) is smaller than that of other portions of the arm 

member( 6, 7), the width being measured in the 
longitudinal direction of the vehicle, and a thickness of 

the center portion (61, 71) of the arm member (6, 7) is 
greater than other portions of the arm member (6, 7), the 

thickness being measured in a vertical direction of the 
vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suspension
arm of a vehicle, according to the preamble of the patent claim 1
and to a manufacturing method according to the patent claims 7 and 13.An upper arm, as a suspension arm, made of fiber
reinforced plastic (FRP) is described in the TOYOTA
Technical Report, April, 1989. This upper arm is adapted
to connect a ball joint comprising a wheel-side connecting
member connected to a wheel to a rubber bush comprising a
vehicle-side connecting member connected to a vehicle
body.The above-mentioned FRP upper arm has an
increased rigidity in a side direction of a vehicle
without increased rigidity in a longitudinal direction of
the vehicle, and thereby riding comfort and stability and
controllability of the vehicle are improved. The FRP
upper arm has a flat A-shaped contour so as to obtain a
high strength against a load applied in the longitudinal
direction. Additionally, the FRP upper arm has three
different patterns of fibers incorporated therein, the
fibers being wound on the ball joint, run through an arm
portion and then wound on a bush portion.However, since the above-mentioned FRP upper arm
is made to be a rigid member, there is no flexibility in
the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Accordingly, 
in order to absorb the load applied in the longitudinal
direction, a rubber bush having an elasticity has to be
provided on each end of the FRP arm. The rubber bush is
required to show a predetermined elastic property even
after a long service time.Additionally, because the FRP upper arm has the
A-shaped contour, tensile and compression stresses due to
the load applied in the longitudinal direction increase at
portions of the FRP upper arm near the ball joint and the
rubber bush. In order to deal with these stresses,
rigidity of an entire arm has to be increased, and thus a
weight of the arm is increased resulting in an increase in
material costs.A further problem is that construction of the
rubber bush is complex and expensive because the rubber
bush has to absorb the load in the longitudinal direction
so as to provide riding comfort to the vehicle. The closest prior art is, however, represented by the document
EP-A 196 351. According to this document a suspension arm
provided between a body and a wheel of a vehicle comprises:
a wheel-side connecting member connected to a
portion of the wheel;at least one vehicle-side connecting member
connected to a portion of the vehicle body;
andan arm member extending between said
wheel-side connecting member and said
