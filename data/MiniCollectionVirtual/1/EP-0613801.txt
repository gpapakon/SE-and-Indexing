<ABSTRACT>
Tank cap (2) for the filling pipe of a liquid container, 
comprising an upper body (6) and a lower body (8) and a 

liquid stop valve (20), comprising a valve body (22), having 
a through-passage to the interior and exterior of the cap (2) 

as well as a pressure equalization valve (18). A valve element 
in the form of a disc (34) is disposed in the valve body 

(22) so that a surge of liquid in the filling pipe against 
the cap (2) will be immediately shut off by the valve disc 

(34) being displaced by the surge to a position blocking the 
passage, thus preventing any penetration of liquid through 

the cap (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tank cap for the filling pipe to a liquid container, 
said cap comprising a stop valve in a through-passsage between an inside and an 
outside of the cap, said stop valve having a valve body in which a valve element is 
displaceably arranged, said valve body being comprised of a surrounding wall 
connected to a bottom with an inlet opening and a top cover with an outlet opening as 
defined in the preamble of claim 1. Such a tank cap is known from the document 
US-A-4 498 599. Caps of this type are used in a number of applications, i.a. as fuel 
tank caps in automobiles. A conventional motor vehicle fuel tank cap is often equipped 
with a pressure equalizing valve to compensate for pressure variations in a volume of 
gas enclosed in the liquid container. Such pressure variations arise, for example, when cold fuel is filled into the fuel tank 
of a motor vehicle, or when warm fuel in the tank cools off to the ambient temperature. 
In the latter case a sub-atmospheric pressure is formed in the tank. Since the fuel 
tank in modern vehicles is usually made of plastic, a sub-atmospheric pressure may 
deform the tank plastically or elastically, thus damaging sensitive components mounted 
in or on the tank. Pressure equalization valves of the type described above make it possible to avoid such 
damage. However, this valve function can be a disadvantage in certain situations. For 
example, in a collision, when the fuel tank is subjected to external impact and is 
possibly deformed, or when the vehicle rolls over, the fuel in the tank can be pressed 
out into the filling pipe, and when it strikes the tank cap valve system, there is a risk 
of fuel leakage, within what is permissible under laws and specifications. Present automobile legislation permits a volume on the order of magnitude of 
15-20 ml of fuel to flow out into the surroundings in such a case, which nevertheless 
increases the risk of fire.  
 The purpose of the present invention is therefore to provide a tank cap of the type 
described by way of introduction which provides both an equalization of pressure 
variations in a gas volume enclosed in a fuel tank and emergency shut-off in the tank 
filling pipe of momentary liquid flow towards the cap. This is achieved according to 
the invention in a tank cap of the type described by way of introduction, in which the 
valve element is a valve disc arranged between said bottom and cover and provided 
with spacer means so disposed on its bottom side as to form pressure

<CLAIMS>
Tank cap for the filling pipe to a liquid container comprising a stop valve (20) in a 
through-passsage between an inside and an outside of the cap, said stop valve having a 

valve body (22) in which a valve element (34) is displaceably arranged, said valve 
body being comprised of a surrounding wall (24) connected to a bottom (26) with an 

inlet opening (30) and a top cover (28) with an outlet opening (32), 
characterized in
 
that the valve element is a valve disc (34) arranged between said bottom (26) and 

cover (28) and provided with spacer means (42) so disposed on its bottom side as to 
form pressure equalization gaps between the spacer means and the bottom (26) when 

the valve disc (34) rests in its normal position via said spacer means (42) against said 
bottom, and that a surge of liquid against the inlet opening (30) is stopped immediately, 

since the valve disc (34) is displaceable by the surge of liquid, to an actuated 
position shutting off said outlet opening (32). 
Tank cap according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the valve disc (34) has on its 
top side an annular gasket (40) and that the spacer means (42) on its underside are 

evenly distributed about the periphery of the valve element (34). 
Tank cap according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that each spacer means is in 
the form of a heel (42). 
Tank cap according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that each spacer means is in 
the form of a radially extending rib (42). 
Tank cap according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
 that 
the tank cap (2) has, in addition to the liquid stop valve (20), a pressure equalization 

valve (18) of a type known per se, coupled in series with said liquid stop valve (20), 
for equalizing pressure variations in a gas volume in the liquid container.
