an organic acid salt, an inorganic acid salt, an oxide
and a chloride of metal elements constituting said

pigment by using a sol-gel method. A simplified
production process can be used and the resulting light-storing

fluorescent pigment has high crystal purity, is
free from contamination with impurities and it is

possible to easily control the particle diameter of the
pigment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light-storing
fluorescent pigment and, more particularly, to a light-storing
fluorescent pigment containing a mother crystal
doped with a rare earth metal.The light-storing fluorescent pigment of the present
invention can be advantageously used as a display means
of various apparatuses, measuring instruments and members
because of its excellent light emitting characteristics,
easy production, lack of contamination with impurities
and ease of control of the particle diameter of pigment
particles. The present invention also relates to a
method of producing such a light-storing fluorescent
pigment. As recognized in this technical field, the
"light-storing fluorescent pigment" refers to a
fluorescent pigment capable of maintaining afterglow
enough to be visually recognized for a time of from tens
of minutes to several hours even after the termination of
stimulation when light is emitted by stimulating the
pigment using ultraviolet radiation.
Background ArtVarious light-storing fluorescent pigments have been
suggested and can be actually purchased and used. Among
them, a popularly used light-storing fluorescent pigment
is a zinc sulfide-based light-storing fluorescent
pigment, that is, those obtained by adding a radioactive
substance to a zinc sulfide-based fluorescent substance
(ZnS:Cu) to enhance the light-storing performance. This
fluorescent pigment can emit light for a long time using
the energy of the added radioactive substance. However,
this fluorescent pigment has such a drawback that it is
chemically unstable and is inferior in light resistance.
Accordingly, its application is limited to a narrow 
range. Furthermore, this fluorescent pigment has such a
drawback that production control is difficult and the
amount is limited because a radioactive substance is
contained.To solve the problems of a conventional zinc
sulfide-based light-storing fluorescent pigment, Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 7-11250
suggests a light-storing fluorescent substance, which is
characterized by using a compound represented by MAl2O4
(M is at least one metal element selected from the group
consisting of calcium, strontium and barium) as a mother
crystal, and adding europium as an activator and an
element such as lanthanum as a coactivator. According to
this invention, there can be obtained a light-storing
fluorescent substance which has afterglow characteristics
with high luminance for a time longer by far than that in
the case of a commercially available sulfide-based
