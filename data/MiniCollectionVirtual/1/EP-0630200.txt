<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a modular chair assembly
according to the preamble of claim 1.While chairs have been around for thousands of years,
the basic structural member has generally been rectangular
and does not lend itself to modular construction.There is also the need, in some environments, for a
plural chair structure which offers some isolation between
chairs, thereby offering their occupants some privacy.It would therefore be desirable to realize a modular
chair construction offering some spacing between seats,
especially a construction which may be assembled in a
variety of seating configurations.GBA 1,204,245 discloses a modular chair assembly which
includes a plurality of tetrahedrons which meet in pairs to
form six linear joints, the joints of each tetrahedron
including a common joint at which one of the faces of each
tetrahedron meets one of the faces of the other tetrahedron
along a common joint. The tetrahedrons do not include
respective support joints which meet respective support
joints of other tetrahedrons to form a support plane placed
against the ground. Rather, the tetrahedrons form an upper
assembly which fits onto a ground engaging base assembly.
Embodiments formed exclusively of equilateral tetrahedrons
are not contemplated.The modular chair assembly of the present invention has two
tetrahedrons fixed together along a common joint and
provided with a seat.Each tetrahedron, like all tetrahedrons, has four 
triangular faces joined at six joints to form a solid. In
the inventive chair, one face of each tetrahedron meets one
of the faces of
another tetrahedron along a common joint to enclose an
external angle outside of the tetrahedrons. Each
tetrahedron further has a support joint which meets the
support joint of the other tetrahedron at a corner common
to the common joint to define a support plane. A support
member fixed between the faces enclosing the external angle
serves as a seat.When the tetrahedron is an equilateral tetrahedron
having four faces outlined by equilateral triangles, the
internal angle between each pair of faces is 70°30'. When
the external angle described above is 109°30', three or more
tetrahedrons may be fixed together along common joints to
provide plural seating in a variety of arrangements.According to one arrangement, four tetrahedrons are
placed together so that their support joints outline a
square and four outwardly facing seats are provided.The tetrahedrons may also be placed together in a
linear arrangement so that a plurality "n" of tetrahedrons
provid
