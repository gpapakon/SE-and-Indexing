<ABSTRACT>
A method of measuring the ¹⁷O isotope content and 
distribution in a body by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 

by collecting first and second nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) signals of the body under the same conditions of 

examination except that before one examination, the body had 
first been irradiated with radio waves at the ¹⁷O resonance 

frequency, whereas before the other examination the body had 
not been so irradiated; and measuring the difference in the 

results of the two examinations to provide an NMR image of 
the ¹⁷O isotope distribution in the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
measuring the 17O isotope content of a body, and
particularly to such a method using nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy examination techniques.
Possible applications of the novel method of the invention
include measuring the rate of perfusion of a solution
administered to a living body, and measuring oxidative
metabolism activity in a living body.Oxygen appears in nature in the form of three
stable (i.e, non-radioactive) isotopes, one with predominant
abundance 16O (99.76%), and two rare isotopes 17O (0.037%)
and 18O isotope (0.20%). The isotopes 16O and 18O do not
possess magnetic moment and therefore they do not have an
effect on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, but
the isotope 17O does have a magnetic moment and therefore
can be detected by NMR. The 17O isotope also has an effect
on other magnetic nuclei associated with it.There are several applications where the detection
of minute amounts of 17O by NMR is important. One is the
measurement of the rate of perfusion by Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI): J.Pekar et al., Magn. Reson. Med. 21, 313
(1991); K.K.Kwong et. al., Magn. Reson. Med. 22, 154 (1991).
This is accomplished by injecting physiological solution 
containing H217O and following the rate of distribution of
the 17O isotope in the body. Another application is
metabolic functional imaging: see J.Pekar et al., supra;
also G.D.Mateescu et al., in "Synthesis and Applications of
Isotopically Labelled Compounds"; T.A.Baillie and J.R.Jones
Eds. Elsevier, Amsterdam, P.499 (1989). In this technique
molecular oxygen (O2) labeled with the 17O isotope is
inhaled by the patent. Since O2 is a paramagnetic molecule,
it cannot be observed by NMR. However, in metabolic active
respiring tissues, it is converted to H2O by oxygen
metabolism.There have been several suggestions in the
literature (e.g., see above publications) of observing the
17O isotope directly by NMR. However, because of the low
sensitivity of 17O NMR, and the high cost of 17O enriched
compounds, this approach seems impractical for medical
applications.The present invention is directed to a novel
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method based on indirect
detection of the 17O isotope using 1H (proton) NMR.
Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is exclusively
based on the detection of the echo signal produced by
protons after being stimulated by a sequence of strong radio
frequency (RF) pulses generated at the resonance frequency
of the protons in a magnetic field.
