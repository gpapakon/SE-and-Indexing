<ABSTRACT>
A green body (38) of a vessel-shaped piece of sanitary 
ware made by slip casting, such as a washbasin, is demolded 

by a robot having an arm (28) provided at its free end with a 
suction pad (30) which is brought into contact with the outer 

surface of the bottom of the green body (38) to hold it by suction. 
The green body is, then, rotated or 
otherwise moved for 
finishing by a stationary device (46,50), while it is held by the 

robot. The robot enables the automatic demolding and finishing 
of the green body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of demolding
and finishing a green body of a vessel-shaped piece of
sanitary ware, such as a washbasin.Slip casting is a method which is widely employed
for molding a vessel-shaped piece of sanitary ware, such
as a washbasin. A shortened molding cycle is achieved by
casting a slip under pressure into a porous mold and drawing
water out of the slip into the pores of the mold.There is known a process which employs a molding
apparatus as shown in Figs. 8A to 8C to eliminate the labor
and equipment for closing and opening each mold. This
method employs a multiplicity of vertically disposed molds
100 which are horizontally movably juxtaposed, and a single
pressure cylinder 102 for closing and pressurizing all of
the molds 100 together, so that a slip may be cast into the
cavity of each mold.The slip can be cast simultaneously into all of the
molds 100. The work after casting, including the demolding
of each green body 104 and its finishing, such as deburring
and boring, is, however, done manually by a worker. After 
each mold 100 has been opened, the green body 104 is
manually demolded, and placed on an appropriately positioned
pallet 106. Then, the pallet 106 is delivered onto a
rotary table 110 and the green body 104 is deburred and
bored (108) by hand tools, while the table 110 is manually
rotated.The green body 104 as molded is soft and liable to
damage, and calls for the utmost care in its handling. Its
finishing involves its complicated movement. Therefore,
the demolding and finishing of the green body 104 has been
difficult to accomplish mechanically or automatically and
has had to be manually done. The manual demolding and finishing
of the green body, however, take labor
and time, and have been an obstacle to the realization of
an automatic process for manufacturing a green body of sanitary
ware. IT-A-1 210 759 discloses a method of withdrawing crude ceramic
articles from forming presses to subsequent treatment stations
in which the articles are held by suction on a trolley.GB-A-2 053 886 discloses a method of handling ceramic articles
in which the articles are held by suction on an arm which
moves the articles from a mold to a processing station.Under these circumstances, it is an aim of this invention to
provide an improved method which enables the automatic
demolding and finishing of a green body of sanitary ware.According to the present invention there is provided a method
of demolding and finishing a green body of sanitary ware
formed by slip casting,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of demolding and finishing a green body of
sanitary ware formed by slip casting, comprising:


preparing a green body (38) of sanitary ware in a casting
machine (10A,10B), between two split sections (16a,16b) of a

mold (16);
opening one split section of the mold to expose the
bottom (40) of the green body, including a portion (42) to be

formed with a hole;
holding the bottom of the green body, except the portion
(42)

to be formed with a hole,
with a suction pad (30) of a robot (18) by suction;
bringing the green body held by the robot arm to a
finishing station including a boring device (46) and a

deburring device (50);
operating the robot arm to move the green body relative
to the boring device to make a hole in the portion (42) and

relative to the deburring device to remove a burr from the
green body; and
removing the green body from the robot arm to another
station.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the suction pad
includes a hollow body, a front face of which is complementary

in shape to the bottom of the green body, elastic foam bonded
to the front face to enable the pad to adhere closely to the

green body, and a multiplicity of suction holes through the
front face.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the said
casting is carried out by two casting machines between which

the robot is installed, and which are alternately employed for
casting so that while one of the casting machines is employed 

for casting a green body made in the other casting machine is
demolded and finished using the robot arm.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the
deburring device includes an endless belt (54) having a

portion dipped in water (52), the green body carried on the
robot arm being brought into contact with the belt to remove a

burr from the green body.
