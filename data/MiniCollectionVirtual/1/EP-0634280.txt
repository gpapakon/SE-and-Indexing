<ABSTRACT>
A thermal print head mounting (1) can be produced inexpensively and mounted in a simple manner, said thermal print head mounting consisting of a first (2) and a second arm (3), which arms are pivotably mounted on an axle (7), fastened in a printer housing (20), by means of hinge casings (4, 5, 6) attached to their ends, and are coupled together mechanically by means of their hinge casings (4, 5, 6) so that they can be uncoupled. The first arm (2) holds a thermal print head which can be brought into contact with a back pressure roller (33) under a force which acts on the second arm (3) and can be transmitted via the mechanical coupling (11, 15) of the hinge casings (4, 5, 6) onto the first arm (2) and the thermal print head, in such a way that a temperature-sensitive recording medium or a carrier ribbon for temperature-sensitive ink can be passed between the back pressure roller (33) and the thermal print head, which ribbon rests with its ink on a recording medium which is insensitive to temperature and is arranged on the back pressure roller (33).
