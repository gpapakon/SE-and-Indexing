<ABSTRACT>
A recording and reproducing 
device provided with at least a pair of 

rotary heads having different azimuths, 
running control means which controls 

the running of a magnetic tape, and 
recording timing control means which 

controls the recording by the rotary 
heads so that the recording can be performed 

in a first period when digital 
data having a first data rate are inputted, 

whereby the digital data can 
be recorded on the magnetic tape at 

the recording timing of the recording 
timing control means. In addition, 

the recording and reproducing device 
is also provided with a memory 

means which temporarily stores digital 
data supplied from the outside, reading 

means which reads out the digital 
data stored in the memory means, 

and signal processing means which 
performs a prescribed process of the 

digital data read out from the memory 
means. When digital data having 

a second data rate which is different 
from the first data rate are inputted, 

the recording timing control means and 
reading-out means perform processes at a 

speed based on the ratio between 
the two data rates and, at the same 

time, the running control means controls 
the running speed of the magnetic 

tape based on the data rate ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to recording and reproducing apparatus. A preferred
form of implementation of the invention described hereinbelow provides such an
apparatus which can efficiently record digital data supplied and can verify whether
the recorded digital data has been correctly recorded or not.A digital recording and reproducing apparatus for recording transmitted digital
image data and digital audio data onto a recording medium such as a magnetic tape
or the like and for reproducing the digital data recorded on the recording medium is
known.An example of a block diagram of such a digital recording and reproducing
apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, in a recording system of digital data, digital
data transmitted via an input terminal 101 is subjected to a predetermined process in
a recording processing circuit 102. A parity having a product code construction
generated by a parity generating circuit 103 is added to output data of the recording
processing circuit 102. In a sync and ID 
generating circuit 104, a sync code and an ID are added
to the data to which the parity was added. Output data
of the sync and ID generating circuit 104 is subjected
to a parallel/serial conversion and a conversion to a
recording code in a channel encoder 105. After the
data was amplified by an amplifier 106, the data is
recorded on a magnetic tape 109 through a recording
side terminal R of a switch 107 and a magnetic head
108.In a reproduction system of image data and
audio data in a digital recording and reproducing
apparatus R, the recording data recorded on the
magnetic tape 109 is supplied to an amplifier and
equalizer 110 through the magnetic head 108 and a
reproducing side terminal (P) of the switch 107 and is
subjected to an amplification and a correction of
frequency characteristics. Output data of the
amplifier and equalizer 110 is subjected to a decoding
of a recording code and a serial/parallel conversion in
a channel decoder 111 and is supplied to a sync and ID
detecting circuit 112. In the sync and ID detecting
circuit 112, a sync code and the ID in the data are
detected and supplied to a TBC (Time Base Corrector)
circuit 113 together with the reproduction data. In
the TBC circuit 113, a time base fluctuation for the
data is eliminated. Output data of the TBC circuit 113
is subjected to an error correcting process using a 
product code in an ECC circuit 114 and, after that, the
data is supplied to an output terminal 116 through a
reproduction processing circuit 115.A tape format of the digital
