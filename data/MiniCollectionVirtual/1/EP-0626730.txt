<ABSTRACT>
A nanofabricated logic device, operable at multiple 
(more than two) logic levels comprises asymmetrically 

coupled quantum point contacts (QPC1, QPC2) provided 
with respective sources (A, B) and drains (D, C) and a 

coupling region (L
T
) between gate electrodes (G
T1
, 
G
T2
). The quantum mechanical carrier wavefunction in 
the region of QPC1, 2 is spatially asmmetric with 

alternate quantised energy levels lying either in QPC1, 
or QPC2, so that by changing the energy level, the 

conductance of the device can be switched between 
multiple stable conductance levels. The device can be 

used to provide a multilevel output switched in 
response to terahertz pulses provided by an array of 

optical detectors (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nanofabricated device which
may be used for multiple-state logic operation and
other signal processing.Conventional logic circuit devices generally operate
with binary logic, such that each circuit element
operates only with two states. When large amounts of
data are to be processed, a very large degree of
integration is required in electronic circuits in order
to enable this to occur. Multiple-state logic devices
have been proposed i.e. devices with more than two
stable states with a view to reducing the total size of
the devices and to accelerate information processing.
For example, multiple-state resonant-tunnelling bipolar
transistors (RTBTs) have previously been proposed - see
F.Capasso, S. Sen and F. Beltram, in High-Speed
Semiconductor Devices ed. S.M. Sze (John Wiley & Sons,
New York 1990) Chap.8 "Quantum-Effect Devices":
However, these prior devices suffer from the
disadvantage that RTBTs need to be stacked in order to 
achieve a high degree of multiplicity in logic operation and as a result,
instability can occur due to background conductance, which can limit the
multiplicity that can be achieved.Our GB-A-2256313 discloses a logic device which makes use of nanometre
scale quantum dots to provide two state logic, in which charge transfer
between the dots is limited by the Coulomb blockade effect. Another two state
quantum effect logic device is disclosed in Elect. Lett. vol 29, no 15, 22/7/93,
pgs. 1380-1 (published after the priority date claimed herein). Stacked multiple
quantum well structures are disclosed in Pat.Abs.Jap. vol 16 no.385(E-1249),
17/8/92 & JP-A-4125966, and Pat.Abs.Jap. vol 16 no.215(E-1204), 20/5/92 &
JP-A-4037069.In accordance with the invention, there is provided an electronic device as claimed in claim 1 hereinafter.As used herein, the term "multiple" means more than two; thus the term
"multiple energy levels" means more than two energy levels and "multiple-level
logic" means logic in which there are more than two, i.e. three or more, logic
states. The wavefunction can be defined in first and second quantum wells, and the
logical level can be determined by monitoring the conductance difference
between the wells. In this way, degradation by background conductance is
minimised.Furthermore, the device, when in one of said states can be used in a number of
different ways, for example as an amplifier or an amplitude modulation device.
The device according to the invention can also be used as an oscillator. The device can also be integrated with a
