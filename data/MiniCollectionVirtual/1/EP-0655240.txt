<ABSTRACT>
A controlled release tablet for oral administration is 
disclosed which has a tablet core including an insoluble 

therapeutically active agent having an aqueous solubility 
of less than or equal to about 5 mg/ml in a sufficient 

amount to render a therapeutic effect. The core provides 
rapid release of said therapeutically active agent upon 

exposure to aqueous solutions. The tablet core is coated 
with a controlled release coating permitting sustained 

release of said therapeutically active agent when said 
coated tablet is exposed to aqueous solutions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The maximum time of effectiveness of many oral dosage
forms is only a few hours. In order to maximize patient
compliance, it is considered very desirable to reduce the
frequency of dosing, thereby reducing the number dosage
forms (e.g., tablets, etc.) a patient must take in order to
attain effective therapy.Sustained release formulations for drugs have become
increasingly available. This is true especially when the
particular drug is relatively soluble. Various formulation
techniques have been used for providing a sustained release
formulation of soluble drugs. In many such formulations,
a drug-containing particle is coated with a coating layer
or is dispersed within a continuous matrix such as a polymeric
matrix. The coating layer or the matrix comprises a
relatively insoluble material or materials, and the release
of the drug is controlled by means of the resistance of the
coating layer or matrix against the diffusion of the drug
therethrough. The release of the drug from such formulations
is driven, e.g., by the gradient of the drug concentration
resulting from penetration of, e.g., gastric
fluid, by diffusion into the formulation.The task of preparing controlled release formulations
of relatively insoluble drugs has proven to be more
difficult, however. Examples of such relatively insoluble
drugs include acetaminophen, naproxen and indomethacin.In part because the bioavailability of relatively
insoluble drugs is highly dependent on the particle size of
the drug or its specific surface area, much of the prior
art directed to the provision of controlled release dosage
forms for relatively insoluble drugs involves the use of
pellets, beads or spheres having a relatively small
particle size.For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,840,799 (Appelgren, et 
al.) is related to the preparation of rapidly disintegrating
core granulates of slightly soluble drugs (solubility
of <1000 mg/l) wherein the drug in particulate form is
coated with a layer of an emulsifier/tensile having the
same HLB-value as the solubility of the drug. The product
is said to provide high bioavailability via the rapid disintegration
and release of the drug at a suitable location
along the gastrointestinal tract.With regard to controlled (slow) release formulations,
in U.S. Patent No. 4,752,470 (Mehta), a controlled release
indomethacin formulation is described wherein coated
pellets of indomethacin of only one type are described.
The pellet is said to release indomethacin in both immediate
and sustained release form. The pellet consists of a
non-
