<ABSTRACT>

(B), for use in apparatus which comprises at least three 

such polyhedral members rotatably mounted with their 
said axes of rotation equidistantly disposed on an 

imaginary circle (
a
), for cutting and shaping a bar-shaped 
dough body (10), such polyhedral member 

comprising upper and lower parallel planar surfaces (17) 
between which the member has a predetermined thickness 

(T), two opposite side surfaces (11,12), each of which 
is formed along an arc (y1,y2) whose radius is equal to 

the rectilinear distance (a') between two adjacent ones 
of said axes in said apparatus, and two tips (2) at 

which the two side surfaces abut each other and which 
form cutting edges, the arrangement being such that when 

the tips of the polyhedral members in said apparatus are 
positioned at the centre of the said circle, each of the 

centres (x1,x2) of the arcs that correspond to the two 
said side surfaces of the polyhedral member is located 

at a distance from the axis of the member that is equal 
to the radius (R) of the said circle and at a distance 

from the centre of the circle that is equal to the said 
distance (a') between two adjacent axes, and wherein the 

members form between themselves an opening (3) that is 
closed and opened by the rotational movement of the 

members.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for cutting and
shaping a food product consisting of a filling enclosed
in a cover, such as a bean-jam bun. More especially, it
relates to such an apparatus comprising a plurality of
cutting and shaping members rotatably mounted on
respective axes disposed on an imaginary circle so that,
in operation, the said members open and close a central
opening which they surround, thereby to cut and shape a
bar-like dough body passing through the opening.Our European Patents Nos. 230,368 and 430,396
disclose apparatuses for so cutting and shaping a bar-like
body. However, these apparatuses have some
drawbacks. Thus, when they have been used to
continuously process dough for an extended time, because
their cutting and shaping members slide on each other or
swing around their axes to close and open the central
opening, they may overheat and seize up, whereby
operation is interrupted. Further, pieces of dough
material or adhesion-preventing powders tend to gather
at the tip regions of the cutting and shaping members
during the cutting process. These unwanted residual
materials or powders may cause problems by adhering to
the members and the cut dough body, and may also cause
protrusion of the filling through the cover. In
addition, there are difficulties in producing a product
with a smooth cover free from flower-like patterns or
folds, which appear at its top as a result of small gaps
being present between the cutting and shaping members
when their tips come together at the centre of the
opening.EP-A-0 430 396 discloses apparatus for cutting and
shaping a bar-shaped dough body, comprising three or
more polyhedral members each having an axis of rotation, 
said members being rotatably mounted with their said
axes of rotation equidistantly disposed on an imaginary
circle, and each having upper and lower parallel planar
surfaces between which the member has a predetermined
thickness, and wherein the members form between
themselves an opening that is closed and opened by the
rotational movement of the members.The present invention is characterised in that each
said member comprises two opposite side surfaces, each
of which is formed along an arc whose radius is equal to
the rectilinear distance between two adjacent ones of
said axes in said apparatus, and two tips at which the
two side surfaces abut each other and which form cutting
edges, the arrangement being such that when the tips of
the polyhedral members are positioned at the centre of
the said circle, each of the centres of the

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for cutting and shaping a bar-shaped
dough body (10), comprising three or more polyhedral

members (1) each having an axis of rotation (B), said
members being rotatably mounted with their said axes of

rotation equidistantly disposed on an imaginary circle
(
a
), and each having upper and lower parallel planar
surfaces (17) between which the member has a

predetermined thickness (T), and wherein the members
form between themselves an opening (3) that is closed

and opened by the rotational movement of the members;
characterised in that each said member comprises two

opposite side surfaces (11,12), each of which is formed
along an arc (y1,y2) whose radius is equal to the

rectilinear distance (a') between two adjacent ones of
said axes (B) in said apparatus, and two tips (2) at

which the two side surfaces abut each other and which
form cutting edges, the arrangement being such that when

the tips of the polyhedral members are positioned at the
centre of the said circle, each of the centres (x1,x2)

of the arcs that correspond to the two said side
surfaces of the polyhedral member is located at a

distance from the axis of the member that is equal to
the radius (R) of the said circle and at a distance from

the centre of the circle that is equal to the said
distance (a') between two adjacent axes.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of
the said side surfaces (11,12) is configured such that

the surface on one side of each tip is convex (13) about
an axis orthogonal to the said axis of rotation (B), and

the surface on the other side of the tip is concave
(14).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the degree
of projection of the said convex surface (13) and of 

recession of the said concave surface (14) both become
sharper toward each tip.
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein one tip portion (21) of the polyhedral member is

cut away.
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the said polyhedral members are associated so

that as they rotate they radially and collectively open
and close an opening (3) concentric with the said circle

(
a
), a tip portion (2) of each polyhedral member
tracking the side surface (11,12) of an adjacent

polyhedral member, and wherein the said opening is

confined through the side surfaces of the polyhedral
members by the rotary movement thereof so that a bar-shaped

dough body (10) passing through the opening is
cut and shaped.
Apparatus for cutting and shaping a bar-shaped
dough body (10), comprising three identically-shaped

polyhedral members (1), each said member being rotatably
mounted to a respective one of three shafts (6) that are

equidistantly disposed on an imaginary circle (
a
) such
that the members radially and collectively open and

close an opening (3) concentric with the circle as they
rotate; characterised in that each of the members has

three sides arranged to form a tip between each pair of
adjacent sides, each side being formed along an arc

(y1,y2,y3) whose radius is equal to the rectilinear
distance (a') between two adjacent ones of the said

shafts, and the arrangement being such that when the tip
of one said member is positioned at the centre of the

circle the centre of each of the arcs (x1,x2) that
correspond to the two sides that abut each other at that

tip is located at a distance from the shaft of the said
member that is equal to the radius (R) of the circle and 

at a distance from the centre of the circle that is
equal to the said distance between two adjacent shafts,

and the centre of the arc corresponding to the remaining
side is located at the centre of the circle, and wherein

the said members are associated such that the opening is
closed by the rotation of the members so that a bar-shaped

dough body passing through the opening is cut and
shaped.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein each of
the said sides has convex and concave surfaces (13,14)

complementary to each other, the convex surface
projecting horizontally outwardly from the side and

extending from midway between two of the tips of the
member to one of such tips, the concave surface receding

horizontally inwardly from the side and extending from
midway between two said tips of the member to the other

of such tips.
