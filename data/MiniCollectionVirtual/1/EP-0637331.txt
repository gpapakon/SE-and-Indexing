<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive composition based on resorcinol novolac or resorcinol-phenolic novolac contains 35-75 % by weight of novolac, less than 25 % by weight of water, and 10-40 % by weight of an aliphatic divalent, trivalent or tetravalent alcohol. The adhesive composition may also contain up to 20 % by weight of filler, based on the amount of novolac, water and alcohol. In a method for preparing the adhesive composition based on resorcinol novolac or resorcinol-phenolic novolac, the novolac is produced by conventional condensation, whereupon an aliphatic divalent, trivalent or tetravalent alcohol is added and water in the novolac is distilled off, resulting in an adhesive composition as defined above. Alternatively, the amount of water can be reduced in the condensation of the novolac to be replaced with an aliphatic divalent, trivalent or tetravalent alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new adhesive composition 
based on resorcinol novolac or resorcinol-phenolic 
novolac. More specifically, the invention concerns a 
novolac-based adhesive composition containing an aliphatic 
divalent, trivalent or tetravalent alcohol. The adhesive 
composition mixed with a hardener has low emission of 
formaldehyde. Resorcinol resin and resorcinol-phenolic resin adhesives 
are commonly used in the wood industry, inter alia 
because of their satisfactory ageing stability, as well as 
good water and weather resistance of the glue line. Also, 
they may readily be cured at room temperature. Generally, resorcinol resins and resorcinol-phenolic 
resins are used in the form of novolacs, i.e. precondensates 
of resorcinol/phenol with formaldehyde, in which the 
ratio of formaldehyde to resorcinol/phenol is less than 1. 
The precondensates are cured by further addition of formaldehyde. 
Since resorcinol is very reactive, a considerable 
amount of the formaldehyde is added to the resin as 
curing agent. As a rule, this is done by the user when 
about to use the resin. It is common that the novolacs are 
cured with pulverulent curing agents based on paraformaldehyde. It is well-known that the use of formaldehyde-based 
adhesives involves the problem of odorous formaldehyde 
emissions. When the pulverulent paraformaldehyde is dissolved 
in the precondensate, formaldehyde is released and 
the adhesive smells. SE 408,063 discloses an attempt to 
solve this problem by having a curing agent in the form of 
a suspension of paraformaldehyde in a non-volatile suspending 
agent. This curing agent does not cause any smell 
problems when fresh, but when added to the adhesive, the 
paraformaldehyde reacts with the water in the adhesive 
mixture, and formaldehyde is released, making the adhesive 
smell. In attempts to reduce the amount of water in the 
novolac, viscosity has increased to an unacceptable level, 
making it impossible to spread the adhesive.  
 An object of the present invention therefore is to 
produce an adhesive based on resorcinol novolac or resorcinol-phenolic 
novolac and having a low emission of formaldehyde 
after the addition of the formaldehyde based 
hardener. Another object of the invention is to produce 
such an adhesive having satisfactory application and gluing 
properties. These objects are achieved by an adhesive composition, 
as defined in the appended claims, which is based on 
resorcinol novolac or resorcinol-phenolic novolac and is 
characterized in that it
