<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a processing apparatus
in which photosensitive material or sheet-like material is
processed using processing solutions for development
processing, fixing processing or stabilizing processing, etc
of, for example, a photographic film, print, etc., or a
photosensitive printing sheet, heat sensitive sheet, etc.
Specifically, the present invention relates to a processing
apparatus in which a sheet-like material or photosensitive
material may be rapidly processed.Conventionally, the dimensions of a development
processing tank must be increased so that the photosensitive
material can be satisfactorily developed, in the same manner
as a processing apparatus such as a development processing
apparatus for photosensitive material, for example, so-called
automatic developing apparatus. Fig. 12 is a central sectional view showing the outline
of the internal structure of a general automatic developing
processor of photosensitive material. In this case, the
apparatus has many conveyance rollers and a long conveyance
path, so that the apparatus becomes larger.In Fig. 12, the conveyance path of photosensitive
material 2 is shown by a one-dotted chain line in a deep
processing tank 100. Many conveyance rollers R for conveying
the photosensitive material are arranged along the conveyance
path. The photosensitive material 2 is vertically conveyed by
being disposed between conveyance rollers R as shown in the
drawing.Conventionally, in the conveyance direction, the number
of conveyance rollers which are in contact with the conveyed
photosensitive material 2 is increased in order to eliminate
uneven processing and uneven development so that a surface
inhibiting layer on the surface of the photosensitive material
2 is destroyed by the surface contact of the conveyance
rollers R with the photosensitive material 2. Therefore, the
development processing speed of the photosensitive material 2
is increased, so that the processing efficiency is enhanced.
Further, the length of the conveyance path is increased so
that the development is completely conducted until delivery of
the photosensitive material 2.Specifically, when the photosensitive material is
processed, the inhibiting material is generated accompanied 
with processing reaction of the photosensitive material, and
the inhibiting layer is formed on the surface of the processed
photosensitive material. Accordingly, fresh processing
solution (processing solution which can conduct development
processing) is not supplied onto the surface of the
