<ABSTRACT>
A freezer box (1) comprises a first heat exchange wall (2) which defines a main hollow interior region (7) for ice cream or other liquid material to be cooled, chilled or frozen. A jacket (10) extends around the first heat exchange wall (2) to form a first secondary hollow interior region (12) for brine (13) which is frozen for freezing the ice cream. A lid (30) which comprises a second heat exchange wall (32) having a cylindrical portion (46) extending into the main hollow interior region (7) closes the freezer box (1). Brine (39) is also provided in a second secondary hollow interior region (38) in the lid (30) for freezing the ice cream. The dimensions of the first and second heat exchange walls (2) and (32) are such that the maximum distance between any location in the main hollow interior region (7) its nearest heat exchange wall (2) or (32) does not exceed 13 mm to promote rapid freezing of the ice cream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a freezer box as defined 
in the preamble of claim 1. Such a box, which is known for 
example from GB-A-808 690, can, in particular, 
be used for freezing ice cream and 
the like. Ice cream is prepared by mixing the appropriate ingredients at 
room temperature, and then freezing the mixture. The freezing 
may be carried out in a continuous process or in a batch process. 
In a continuous process, the mixed ingredients are continuously 
passed through a freezer where the temperature of the mixture is 
reduced so that it commences to solidify. In a batch process, a 
batch of mixed ingredients is placed in a freezer until the 
mixture commences to solidify. In both cases, the partly 
solidified mixture is then transferred for packaging and further 
freezing. While both of these processes are adequate for 
manufacturing ice cream in large quantities, typically, on a 
commercial scale, in general, they are unsuitable for producing 
relatively small batches of ice cream, typically, a batch of the 
size which would be made at home for home use or for use in a 
relatively small restaurant. Various attempts have been made to 
provide apparatus, such as, for example, freezer boxes for the 
manufacture of ice cream in relatively small batches in the home, 
however, in general, such apparatus and freezer boxes suffer from 
a number of disadvantages. In general, the ice cream produced 
from such apparatus and freezer boxes is of relatively poor 
quality. In particular, the ice cream lacks the relatively 
smooth consistency which is desirable in a good quality ice 
cream. During the freezing process of an ice cream mixture, ice 
crystals are formed from the liquid water in the ice cream 
mixture. To maintain a relatively smooth consistency in the 
frozen ice cream, it is essential that the ice crystals formed 
should be relatively small. The smaller the ice crystals can be 
maintained the smoother will be the ice cream. One -of the 
problems with known apparatus and freezer boxes for use in the 
production of home made ice cream is that the ice crystals formed  
 
in the ice cream, in general, are relatively large, 
and thus, significantly and adversely affect the 
consistency of the frozen ice cream. As mentioned above, GB-A-808,690 describes 
a freezer box having the features 
of the preamble of claim 1. In this document, no indication 
is given about the distance between any location in the main hollow 
interior region and its nearest heat exchange surface. There is therefore a need
