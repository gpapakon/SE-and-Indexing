<ABSTRACT>
Threaded parts for aircraft made of heat-resistant
steel which will never seize even after subjected to

large temperature fluctuations and vibrations for a long
time. Thus they can be tightened sufficiently and also

loosened for maintenance and inspection. The threaded
parts are made of heat-resistant steel and having its

surface subjected to carburizing so as to satisfy the
following equations:


0 ≦ X ≦ 100,   Y ≧ -10X + 600,
Y ≦ -6X + 1000

where X is the depth (µm) from the surface of the

threaded part and and Y is the Vickers hardness (HV).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to threaded parts for
aircraft which are used under extremely large temperature
fluctuations, and more particularly to threaded parts for
aircraft made of heat-resistant steel.Threaded parts such as nuts and bolts used for
aircraft are required to stably and reliably maintain
their function and quality even under conditions far
severer than normally expected use conditions to ensure
safety of aircraft. This requirement is especially
severer for threaded parts used in portions associated
with aircraft engines and fuselages because the failure
of such threaded parts can directly lead to a grave
accident and also threaded parts used in such portions
are subjected to especially large temperature fluctuations.Threaded parts used at such portions are typically
exposed to extremely cold air at high altitude, cold air
from cooled portions of the aircraft or low temperatures
conducted therefrom, and hot air from engines or heat
conducted therefrom. Thus, resistance to thermal stress
is also required for such threaded parts.Typical materials for such threaded parts for
aircraft include alloy steel, corrosion-resistant steel 
and heat-resistant steel SUH660 (A-286, JIS G 4311).
Heat-resistant steel (SUH660) is an austenite Fe-Ni-Cr
alloy of a precipitation-hardening type, and exhibits
high strength and corrosion resistance up to 704°C. In
the aerospace field, its maximum applicable temperature is
said to be 649 °C (1200° F). Thus, it is usually
strengthened by aging treatment at 700-780°C.Among threaded parts for aircraft, nuts and bolts
used at or near combustion chambers of the engine tend to
be subjected to severe thermal stresses. That is, these
threaded parts tend to be partially or entirely subjected
to thermal shocks due to temperature fluctuations ranging
from about 600 °C to about 0 °C. Safety consideration is
therefore given to these parts so as not to be cracked or
destroyed due to such thermal shocks.Compared with alloy steel, threaded parts for
aircraft made of heat-resistant steel are physically
characterized by the facts that thermal conductivity is
about 1/3, that thermal expansion coefficient is about
1.5 times higher, and that friction coefficient is high.
Due to synergistic effect of these characteristics,
threaded parts tend to seize (or stick fast through
excessive heat and get locked and unturnable) when
tightened by power tools or hand wrenches. Thus, to
prevent seizure, conventional such threaded parts are
electrically plated with cadmium or nickel, or have their

A threaded part for use in aircraft, the threaded
part being made of heat-resistant steel by subjecting its

surface to plasma carburization treatment at a temperature
of 700 to 780 °C so as to be absent of a stepwise

carburisation profile and satisfy the following equations:

   0 ≦ X ≦ 100,   Y ≧ -10x + 600,

   Y ≦ -6x + 1000

wherein X is the depth (µm) from the surface of the
threaded part and Y is the Vickers hardness (HV).
