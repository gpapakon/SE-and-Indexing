<ABSTRACT>
A method of compacting a dump of old precompressed waste and of obtaining a supplementary receiving capacity for new waste, in which a displacement body is sunk in the dump by the solid displacement method for the purpose of forming a cavity, is then withdrawn, and the resulting cavity is filled with new waste and the latter is compacted with the use of a drop weight, uses a device in which a pipe (2) having a threaded tip (3) is used as the displacement body. The pipe (2) is screwed into the dump (20, 21) while rotating about a vertical axis (x-x) and under the action of axial thrust forces.

A process for consolidating a landfill of old 
precompressed waste and obtaining supplementary receiving 

capacity for new waste, whereby a displacement body is sunk 
into the landfill, utilizing a complete-displacement 

process, in order to form a cavity, and is thereafter 
extracted, and the thus-obtained cavity is filled with new 

waste, and said new waste is compacted using a drop weight, 


characterized in that
 
as displacement body a tube (2) having a crest of thread 

(3) is used, and that said tube (2) is screwed under 
rotation, by means of a screwing process, into the landfill 

(20,21), about a vertical axis (x-x) and under action of 
axial pressure forces. 
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the tube (2) is screwed into the landfill (20,21) utilizing 

a pipe turning machine (1) cooperating with a lifting 
device (10). 
The process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the tube (2) is srewed into the landfill (20,21) in 

dry condition, i.e. not using drilling fluid. 
The process according to 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the tube (2) is screwed into the landfill (20,21) under 

addition of drilling fluid. 
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a tube (2) is used having a diameter 

that is not suitable for dynamic vibrating, for instance a 
diameter of 1500 to 2000 mm.  

 
The process according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the drilling fluid is introduced under pressure from the 

crest of thread (3) into the heap of waste (21) to be 
drilled. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that subsequent to extraction of the 

displacement body (2), a spreadable expansion body (30) is 
lowered into the drilled hole (25), and is spread in at 

least one plane along the axle (x-x) of the drilled hole 
(25) transversely to said plane, utilizing comparatively 

very large expansion forces which act transversely to the 
axis of the drill hole (25). 
The process according to claim 7, chracterized in that 
the expansion body (30) is laterally expanded by the action 

of comparatively very large, hydraulically generated 
expansion and pressure forces which act transversely to the 

axis (x-x) of the drilled hole (25), thereby increasing the 
volume of the drilled hole (25). 
The device for consolidating a landfill of old pre-compressed 
waste and obtaining supplementary receiving 

capacity for new waste, in particular for carrying out the 
process of this invention according to any one of claims 1 

to 8, 
characterized in that
 said device is provided with a 
pipe turning machine (1), cooperating with a lifting device 

(10), for screwing-in of a tube-shaped displacement body 
(2) having a closed crest of thread (3) into the landfill 

(20,21). 
The device according to claim 9, characterized in that 
the crest of thread (3) is an acutely conical taper  

 
comprising an arrangement of helically formed thread 

surfaces or spirals (6). 
The device according to any one of claims 9 or 10, 
characterized in that an expansion body (3) formed such 

that it can be introduced into the drilled hole (25) is 
associated thereto, and that said expansion body (3) is 

provided with at least two surface parts (31) and (32) 
which are divisible and spreadable in a vertical plane 

(y-y) and which can be spread by means of hydraulic 
piston/cylinder units towards both sides transversely to 

the drill hole axis (x-x).
