<ABSTRACT>
Device for assembly between a lock assembly (10) and an actuator cam (22) previously assembled into a steering lock casing (20) for a motor vehicle, the said lock assembly (10) having at the end of a rotor (12) a coupling snout (34) intended to interact with a housing (48) in the actuator cam (22), characterised in that it comprises, associated with first translational securing means (24, 26, 44) which are active regardless of the relative angular positions of the lock assembly (10) and of the actuator cam (22), second translational securing means (38) which are active for at least one predetermined relative angular position of the said lock assembly (10) and of the said actuator cam (22).

A device comprising, in combination when assembled 
together, a lock unit (10), a motor vehicle steering 

anti-theft device housing (20), and a control cam (22) 
pre-assembled to the said housing (20) in an angular 

assembly position which is different from the locking 
position of the anti-theft device, the lock assembly 

(10) having, at the end of a rotor (12), a coupling 
nose (34) which is adapted to cooperate with a recess 

(48) in the control cam (22) so as to establish 
coupling in rotation between the lock assembly (10) and 

the control cam (22), characterised in that, associated 
with first means (24, 26, 44) for fixing together in 

straight line movement the lock assembly (10) and the 
control cam (22), the said first means being active 

regardless of the relative angular positions of the 
said lock assembly (10) and the said control cam (22), 

the device includes second means (38) for fixing 
together in straight line motion the lock assembly (10) 

and the said housing (20), the said second means being 
active in at least one predetermined relative angular 

position of the lock assembly (10), including the 
control cam (22), with respect to the said housing 

(20), which is different from the assembly position.  
 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the first means for fixing together in straight 

line movement comprise a relief (44) formed on the 
coupling nose (34) and adapted to cooperate with a stop 

catch (24) of the control cam (22). 
A device according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the stop catch (24) has a branch (54) which is 

adapted to penetrate into a recess (56) in a single 
position of the lock assembly (10) relative to the 

control cam (22). 
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the single relative position corresponds to the 

assembly position of the lock assembly (10) with the 
control cam (22). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the coupling nose (34) 

has an inclined face (46) at its end. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the second means for fixing together in straight 

line motion comprise a radial arm (38) of the coupling 
nose (34). 
A steering anti-theft device for a motor vehicle, 
comprising in particular a lock assembly (10) and a 

control cam (22), characterised in that it includes a  
 

device in accordance with any one of the preceding 
Claims.
