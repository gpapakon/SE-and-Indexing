<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cathode ray tube in which 
a shadow mask 10 is suspended 
via
 pins 19. Each pin 19 
comprises a base 23 in the form of a truncated cone and a 

gradually widening free part 25. A contact spring 15 is 
connected to a pin in a clamping manner, at least a portion 

24 of the contact spring 15 engaging the gradually widening 
free end 25. The contact spring 15 produces a simple and 

reliable electric connection between the shadow mask 10 and 
the electrically conductive layer 20 against which the 

contact spring 15 bears under a pre-stress.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cathode ray tube 
comprising an envelope having an electrode system for 
generating three electron beams, a substantially rectangular 
display window having an upright edge and comprising a 
display screen with phosphor elements luminescing in 
different colours, the display screen being coated with an 
electrically conductive layer, a substantially rectangular 
shadow mask comprising a large number of apertures which 
allot each electron beam to luminescent phosphor elements of 
one colour, a substantially rectangular supporting frame to 
which the shadow mask is connected, and pins which are 
connected to the upright edge of the display window and each of which has at least 
partly the shape of a truncated cone for suspending the 
supporting frame in the display window from suspension means, 
the said shadow mask being electrically connected to the 
conductive layer by at least one contact spring, a part of 
which engages one of the pins and another part of which 
engages the layer. Such a cathode ray tube is known from German 
Offenlegungsschrift 2622695. The electric connection 
between the shadow mask and the electrically conductive layer 
in this case is produced by at least one contact spring which 
is interposed between a suspension means and a pin having the 
shape of a truncated cone and which is fixed on the pin by 
the suspension means. The pressure which the contact spring exerts on the 
electrically conductive layer depends upon the distance 
between the place where the contact spring engages the 
suspension means of the shadow mask and the electrically 
conductive layer. If a good electric connection is to be 
produced for various types of cathode ray tubes or with the 
occurring tolerances in the dimensions of the shadow mask  
 
and/or the display window, different contact springs are 
necessary per type or with deviating tolerances. Since the 
contact spring engages the suspension means in a resilient 
manner the contact spring and the display window can perform 
different movements with respect to each other in the case of 
vibrations, for example, those which are present in the 
shadow mask and are transmitted to the suspension means. As a 
result of this the contact spring at the area where it 
engages the electrically conductive layer under pressure rubs 
over the layer so that the electric connection is 
detrimentally influenced. It is the object of the invention to provide a 
cathode ray tube having a simple electric connection of the 
shadow mask with

<CLAIMS>
1. A cathode ray tube comprising an envelope having an 
electrode system (4) for generating three electron beams (5, 6, 7), a 

substantially rectangular display window (1) having an upright 
edge (36) which display window comprises a display screen (8) having 

phosphor elements luminescing in different colours, the 
display screen being coated with an electrically conductive 

layer (20), a substantially rectangular shadow mask (10) comprising a 
large number of apertures (11) which allot each electron beam to 

luminescent phosphor elements of one colour, a substantially 
rectangular supporting frame (18) to which the shadow mask is 

connected, and pins (19) which are connected to the upright edge of the display window 
and each of which has at least partly the form of a truncated 

cone (23) for suspending the supporting frame in the display 
window by suspension means (40), the said shadow mask being 

connected electrically to the conductive layer by at least 
one contact spring (15) a part of which engages one of the pins 

and another part of which engages the layer, characterized in 
that the pin comprises a gradually widening free end (25) and the 

at least one contact spring is connected to the pin in a 
clamping manner, at least a part of the contact spring 

engaging the gradually widening free end. 
2. A cathode ray tube as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that the part of the contact spring which 

engages the gradually widening free end of the pin comprises 
a recess (21) and two projections (22) situated on each side of the 

recess, said recess fitting in a clamping manner around the 
transition from the part in the form of a truncated cone (23) of 

the pin to the gradually widening free end (25) of the pin. 
3. A cathode ray tube as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in that the contact spring is a flat metal  

 
element having a flat portion (24) which comprises the recess (21), and 

the two projections (22) are at such an angle with the flat 
portion that the two projections engage a part of the cone. 
4. A cathode ray tube as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in that the contact spring is a metal wire (30) the 

ends of which engage the conductive layer, the wire 
comprising an arcuate portion (34) which surrounds the recess (31) and 

comprises the two projections (32) which engage a part of the 
cone.
