<ABSTRACT>
A process for operating a data processing system adapted for parallel execution of two or more redundant tasks (30) which receive identical data, in which messages (60), each incorporating such data and a time stamp (62), are transferred to the redundant tasks, the messages transferred to each redundant task being ordered in a chronological order so as to be processed by the redundant task in this order and a stability date is determined for each message with a view to defining the instant starting at which the redundant task can process the message, characterised in that the ordering of the messages transferred to a redundant task is based on the time stamps of the messages augmented respectively by first time constants (Ci) and the stability dates of the messages are determined on the basis of the time stamps of these messages augmented respectively by second time constants (Ri).

A method of operating a data processing system adapted for running
two or more identical-data-receiving replicated tasks (30) in

parallel, in which method messages (60) each including such data and
a time stamp (62) are transferred to the replicated tasks by

transmitter tasks to which different-level priorities are assigned,
the transmitter tasks comprising transmitter tasks T
1
, T
2
, ..., T
M

having high level priorities and transmitter tasks T
M+1
; ..., T
N

having lower level priorities, the messages transferred to each
replicated task being sequenced in chronological order so as to be

processed by the replicated task in that order, and a stability time
being determined for each message, which stability time defines the

instant from which the replicated task may process the message, said
method being characterized in that the sequencing of the messages

transferred to a replicated task is based on the message time stamps
plus respective first time constants C
j
, and the stability times of
the messages are determined on the basis of the message stamps plus

respective second time constants R
j
,

   and in that the first time constants C
j
 are calculated on the
basis of the following relationships:



   and


   where

av
k
= (m
k
+M
k
)/2 for k→1,N
diff
k
= (M
k
-m
k
)/2 for k→1,N
 
   and in that the second time constants R
j
 are calculated on the
basis of the following relationship, (the index 
j
 ranging from 1 to
N)
:

R
j
 = max (M
k
 - C
k
) + C
j
, for k≠j.

   where m
k
 and M
k
 respectively represent the minimum and the
maximum transfer time required for a pre-measured item of data to be

transferred from each transmitter task T
k
 to a replicated task.
The method according to claim 1, in which the first and second
time constants are calculated prior to the emitting tasks

transferring messages to the replicated tasks, and in which each
message includes a code (63) which identifies the emitting task of

the message so that the first and second time constants corresponding
to the emitting task can be recovered for the message on the basis of

said code.
