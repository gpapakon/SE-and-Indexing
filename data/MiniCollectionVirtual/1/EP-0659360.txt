<ABSTRACT>
Fastening device (1), particularly for fastening two 
flaps of a sports shoe, including an engagement element (7) 

for being rigidly coupled to a first flap, a traction 
element (16), and a lever arm (2) that is rotatably 

associated with a first pivot (3) interposed between a first 
pair of wings (4a,4b) that protrudes from a base (5) for 

being associated with a second flap to be fastened. The back 
(8) of the lever arm interacts with the traction element to 

allow to lock the traction element adjacent to the base and 
to subsequently place the lever arm, with no forces applied 

to it, in the direction of the engagement element. The lever 
arm has a very limited protrusion and a secondary lever (13) 

is provided to allow the rapid and easy release of the 
traction element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastening device
particularly for sports shoes and particularly for ski boots
or skates.Numerous levers used in ski boots are currently known;
for this purpose, Italian Patent no. 1039897 discloses a
lever constituted by an arm which is pivoted at one end, by
means of an appropriate pivot, to two shoulders which are
rigidly coupled to a flap of the boot; the arm has a toothed
region for interaction with the end of a hook that can be
associated, at its other end, with the other flap of the
boot to be closed.This known lever must have a surface finish that is
aesthetically adequate, because it is visible on the boot;
this accordingly entails the use of materials, such as
aluminum or plastics, that have an attractive outward
appearance for the skier, but such materials do not have the
high-level strength characteristics required to withstand
the stresses and impacts to which they are subjected during
sports practice.In any case, the protrusion of the levers with respect
to the lateral surface of the boot does not give said boot a
clean aesthetic appearance, as said levers tend to
accidentally open or break in case of impact with the snow-covered
piste or with the slalom pole or with the other
boot.The lever is furthermore subjected to loads when
closed, and this increases the possibility of breakage.As a partial solution to these drawbacks, Italian
Patent 1054289 discloses a closure assembly for ski boots 
which, despite using a simplified structure, has been found
to be difficult to close due to the limited hand resting
surface to which the closing effort must subsequently be
applied.Italian patent no. 1,082,434 is also known which
discloses a lever device for closing a ski boot; said device
comprises a toothed band, which is rigidly coupled to a flap
of the upper, and a lever, which is rigidly coupled to the
other flap of the upper and has a ratchet-like advancement
system which cooperates with the toothed band so as to close
the boot.This solution allows to increase the degree of tension
of the toothed band while maintaining the previously
achieved degree of fastening, but at the same time it has
other drawbacks which are due essentially to its structural
complexity and to the difficulty in operating it, because it
is necessary to place the tip of the lever, which is pivoted
at the end of the lever, at the interspace between two
adjacent teeth of the band, so that jamming does not occur
during the closure of the lever; in order to obviate this
drawback, it is necessary

(322) of said secondary lever (313) interact with said
second pivot (324) so further liftin
g towards said
engagement element allows to raise said head (310) of said

connecting element (309), moving the end of said traction
element (306) that is rotatably connected to said head

beyond said first pivot (303), so as to allow disengagement
from said engagement element.
Device according to claim 26, characterized in that
during closure said lever arm (302) is rotated towards said

base (305) so that said back (308) of said wings which are
adjacent to said seat (312) interacts with the wings of said

head (310) of said connecting element 309), making it rotate
