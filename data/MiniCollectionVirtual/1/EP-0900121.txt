<ABSTRACT>
Methods are provided for the selective removal of carbon dioxide from a multicomponent gaseous stream (16) to provide a carbon dioxide depleted gaseous stream (36) having at least a reduction in the concentration of carbon dioxide relative to the untreated multicomponent gaseous stream (16). In the subject methods, the multicomponent gaseous stream (16) is contacted with carbon dioxide nucleated water (14) under conditions of selective carbon dioxide clathrate formation, where the carbon dioxide nucleated water (14) serves as liquid solvent. The subject methods find use in a variety of applications where it is desired to selectively remove carbon dioxide from a multicomponent stream (16), including chemical feedstock processing applications and air emissions control applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is selective absorption of CO2
gas.In many applications where mixtures of two or more gaseous
components are present it is often desirable to selectively remove
one or more of the component gases from the gaseous stream. Of
increasing interest in a variety of industrial applications,
including power generation and chemical synthesis, is the selective
removal of CO2 from multicomponent gaseous streams.An example of where selective CO2 removal from a
multicomponent gaseous stream is desirable is the processing of
synthesis gas or syngas. Syngas is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon
monoxide and CO2 that is readily produced from fossil fuels and finds
use both as a fuel and as a chemical feedstock. In many applications
involving syngas, the carbon monoxide is converted to hydrogen and
additional CO2 via the water-gas shift process. It is then often
desirable to separate the CO2 from the hydrogen to obtain a pure H2
stream for subsequent use, e.g. as a fuel or feedstock.As man made CO2 is increasingly viewed as a pollutant,
another area in which it is desirable to separate CO2 from a
multicomponent gaseous stream is in the area of pollution control.
Emissions from industrial facilities, such as manufacturing and power
generation facilities, often comprise CO2. In such instances, it is
often desirable to at least reduce the CO2 concentration of the
emissions. The CO2 may be removed prior to combustion in some case
and post combustion in others.A variety of processes have been developed for removing or
isolating a particular gaseous component from a multicomponent
gaseous stream. These processes include cryogenic fractionation,
selective adsorption by solid adsorbents, gas absorption, and the
like. In gas absorption processes, solute gases are separated from 
gaseous mixtures by transport into a liquid solvent. In such
processes, the liquid solvent ideally offers specific or selective
solubility for the solute gas or gases to be separated.Gas absorption finds widespread use in the separation of CO2
from multicomponent gaseous streams. In CO2 gas absorption processes
that currently find use, the follow steps are employed: (1)
absorption of CO2 from the gaseous stream by a host solvent, e.g.
monoethanolamine; (2) removal of CO2 from the host solvent, e.g. by
steam stripping; and (3) compression of the stripped CO2 for
disposal, e.g. by sequestration through deposition in the deep ocean.Although these processes have proved successful for the
selective removal of CO2 from a multicomponent
