<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for a wheel for a wheelchair comprising a planetary gear (4) integrated with the aforementioned wheelchair wheel. A sun wheel, planet wheel and ring wheel incorporated in the gear are accommodated in a hub (5) comprising a hub inner part (6) and a hub outer part (7), which parts are rotatably supported relative to one another, are carried by a main shaft (13) capable of attachment to the wheelchair (3). The aforementioned hub parts (6, 7) are supported by means of bearing devices (17, 18, 19) acting around the periphery of the hub (5), which devices are so arranged on the one hand as to support the hub parts (6, 7) radially relative to one another, and are so arranged on the other hand as to provide axial locking of the hub parts (6, 7) relative to one another. In accordance with the invention, the bearing device (14) is formed from a number of grooves (17, 18) extending around the periphery of said hub parts (6, 7), inside which grooves rolling devices (19) or a plain bearing component are so arranged as to act. The aforementioned radial grooves (17, 18) are arranged directly in line with one another on the internal envelope surface of the outer part (7) of the hub and on the external envelope surface of the inner part (6) of the hub when the hub parts (6, 7) are assembled to form a wheelchair wheel hub (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
Device at a wheel for a wheel chairThe present invention relates to an arrangement for a wheel for a wheelchair, which comprises a planetary gear integrated with the aforementioned wheelchair wheel, and that a sun wheel, planet wheel and ring wheel incorporated in the gear are accommodated in a hub comprising a hub inner part and a hub outer part, which parts are rotatably supported relative to one another, and are carried by a main shaft capable of attachment to the wheelchair, in conjunction with which the aforementioned hub parts are supported by means of bearing devices acting around the periphery of the hub, which devices are so arranged on the one hand as to support the hub parts radially relative to one another, and on the other hand as to provide axial locking of the hub parts relative to one another .The arrangement of gears on wheelchairs, in particular planetary gears is not so commonly established.Previously disclosed solutions are complicated and are formed from a number of parts, each of which is difficult to produce, because several elements are included in each part, which also makes the gear expensive to produce. The support and locking of the constituent parts are thus also complicated.The arrangement for a wheel for a wheelchair previously disclosed through WO 94/20323 Al comprises a bearing formed from conventional roller bearings that are inserted between internal shafts and an external cage. The assembly and construction of this previously disclosed bearing is complicated and not so simple, effective and economical .The principal object of the present invention is thus, in the first instance, to identify an appropriate 

solution that is both simple to produce and apply and is not too costly to implement.Said object is achieved by means of an arrangement in accordance with the present invention, which is characterized essentially in that the bearing device is formed from a number of grooves extending around the periphery of said hub parts, inside which grooves rolling devices or a plain bearing component are so accommodated as to act, in conjunction with which the aforementioned radial grooves are arranged directly in line with one another on the internal envelope surface of the outer part of the hub and on the external envelope surface of the inner part of the hub when the hub parts are assembled to form a wheelchair wheel hub. The invention is described below as a preferred illustrative embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:Fig. 1 shows a

1. Arrangement (1) for a wheel (2) for a wheelchair
(3), which comprises a planetary gear (4) integrated with the aforementioned wheelchair wheel, and that a sun wheel (10), planet wheel and ring wheel (12) incorporated in the gear (4) are accommodated in a hub (5) comprising a hub inner part (6) and a hub outer part (7), which parts are rotatably supported relative to one another, and are carried by a main shaft (13) capable of attachment to the wheelchair (3), in conjunction with the aforementioned hub parts (6,7) are supported by means of supporting devices (14) acting around the periphery of the hub, which devices are so arranged on the one hand as to support the hub parts (6,7) radially relative to one another, and on the other hand as to provide axial (15) locking of the hub parts (6,7) relative to one another, characterized in that the bearing device (14) is formed from a number of grooves (17,18) extending around the periphery (16) of said hub parts (6,7), inside which grooves rolling devices (19) or a plain bearing component are so arranged as to act, in conjunction with which the aforementioned radial grooves (17,18) are arranged directly in line with one another on the internal envelope surface (20) of the outer part (7) of the hub and on the external envelope surface (8) of the inner part (6) of the hub when the hub parts (6,7) are assembled to form a wheelchair wheel hub (5) . 2. Arrangement as claimed in Patent Claim 1, characterized in that a large number of balls (19) is so arranged in the aforementioned grooves (17,18) as to be accommodated in order to roll in a long row and to functio.n as a bearing and locking device. 

3. Arrangement as claimed in Patent Claim 2, characterized in that pairs of grooves (17-17 ; 18-18) are arranged axially displaced from one another.
4. Arrangement as claimed in one or other of patent Claims 1-3, characterized in that a passage (22) is present in the hub (5) to permit the insertion of the aforementioned rolling devices (19) or plain bearing component externally from outside the hub.
5. Arrangement as claimed in Patent Claim 4, characterized in that a hole (22) extends through the material (23) of the outer part (7) of the hub as far as the area (24) directly in line with one of the aforementioned grooves (18) therein
6. Arrangement as claimed in Patent Claim 5, characterized in that the hole (22) is threaded (25) to enable it to accept a plug (26) therein, thereby closing the hole.
7. Arrangement as claimed in Patent Claim 6, characterized in that the hole (22) extends axially. 8. Arrangement as claimed in Patent Claim 1, characterized in that a flexible plastic rod is capable of being accommodated in the aforementioned grooves to form a sliding bearing between the parts of the hub.
