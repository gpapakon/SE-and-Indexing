<ABSTRACT>
To produce metal-free embossed inner liners in cigarette packs, a paper is used which consists of cellulose digested by the sulphite process, has preferably been oxygen-bleached, has a weight per unit area of about 39 to 45 g/m
<
2
>
, a filler content, preferably of calcium carbonate, of 9 to 17 % by weight, a Copp value of 20 +/- 4 g/m

 and AKD sizing. The embossing (2) is incorporated on line on the paper machine into the still wet paper (1). An at least one-sided coating (3) of a water vapour-impermeable, flexible and recyclable copolymer of neutral odour allows optimised protection of moisture and aroma for the packed cigarettes, in particular if the coating (3) is also heat-sealable.
