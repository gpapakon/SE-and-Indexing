<ABSTRACT>
An automatic plate feeding system for loading plates of various sizes into a
printing plate imaging device (25), which includes a plurality of trays (32A,32B,32C) staggered one on

top of the other, wherein at least two of said plurality of trays contain plates of
different sizes, the plates having separation papers (38) interposed there between and

an arm mechanism (36) for loading plates from the plurality of trays and feeding the
loaded plates to the imaging device (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a system for loading a
printing plate into a plate imaging device and specifically to a system for
automatic loading of plates of various sizes into a plate setter or a printing
plate imaging device.A variety of systems and applications use stacks of sheets or plates,
which may be made of metal, paper, plastic and the like. Printing plates
(hereinafter singly or collectively referred to as "plates") are typically stacked
in a cassette or similar container which houses the plates and facilitates their
protection, transportation and handling.A specific system will using plates generally use trays having specific
dimensions. Trays can usually be set to contain plates of various sizes, but all
plates in the same tray are of one size. Usually the plates are manually
removed from the cassette or the shipping container and inserted into the
trays for use by the system, for example, a plate imaging system.Plates are usually packed in the cassette with intermediate paper
sheets, hereinafter referred to as 'separation paper'. The separation papers
are disposed during loading into the imaging device by a mechanism such as
described in US-A-6164637 (published 26 December 2000) assigned to the
common assignee of the present invention.A typical conventional plate feeding system from a tray is shown
schematically in Fig. 1. Plates 12 are supplied, within a tray 14, stacked one
on top of the other with separation papers 16 between the plates.Various mechanisms have been developed for removing a single plate
12 from the tray 14 and loading it using loading arm 18 to the loading plane 23
of the imaging system 20. Usually the feeding system includes a mechanism
for disposing of the separation paper 16 into a paper bin 22 illustrated, for
example.One such system is described in US Patent No: 5,785,309 assigned to
the common assignee of the present invention. The loading method described
has. the disadvantage in that, if a different plate size needs to be loaded for a
subsequent operation, then the tray in use needs to be replaced by a tray
containing the required plate size, or the tray itself needs to be replenished 
with plates of the required size. Replacing cassettes is a costly procedure and
time consuming operation.U.S Patent No. 5,367,360 to Mcllwraith et al. describes a method for
loading plates from a single tray. In this case, the cardboard shipping
container is used as a tray and the plates are lifted and loaded vertically by a
vacuum system.The use of several trays

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (30) for automatically loading printing plates (34) into an
imaging device (25), the apparatus comprising:


a plurality of trays (32) for receiving printing plates (34) of at least two
different sizes and having separation paper (38) interposed therebetween;
an arm mechanism (36) for loading plates (34) from said plurality of
trays (32) and feeding said loaded plates to said imaging device (25);
a loading plane (54) positioned between the plurality of trays (32) and
the imaging device (25); and
a control unit (52) coupled to the arm mechanism (36) and the imaging
device (25),

   
characterized in that
 the arm mechanism (36) includes a motorized X-Y
arm (42, 44, 46) and is equipped with an array of suction cups (50) mounted

on a bar (48) attached to a Y arm (46), and

   at least one sensor for distinguishing between plates (34) and
separation papers (38), and at least one paper removal gripper for gripping

said separation papers (38), said sensor and said grippers being installed on the
bar (48) next to the suction cups
 (50), and

   said plurality of trays are staggered one on top of the other and each of
the plurality of staggered trays (32) and the loading plane (54) are equipped with

at least one row of rollers (64),

   and the apparatus is operative to load plates (34) from the trays (32) to
loading plane (54) by lifting and dragging the plate (34) over the rollers (64) through

an offset distance (W) between the trays (32).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the offset distance W
between the trays (32) is 70 mm.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the trays (32) are equipped with
adjustable pins (58) allowing for loading plates (34) of various sizes. 
A method for loading plates (34) in an apparatus according to any one
preceding claim, the method comprising:


a) positioning the motorized X-Y arm (36) over the selected tray
(32);
b) lowering the bar (48) to make contact with the upper plate (34)
stacked in the selected tray (32);
c) activating the paper sensor for determining the presence of the
separation paper (38);
d) removing the separation paper (38) with the at least one gripper;
e) activating the suction cups (50) and lifting a single plate (34) out of the
tray (32) through offset W;
f) dragging the lifted plate (34) over the rollers (64) to the loading plane
(54);
g) releasing the plate (34) and returning the X-Y arm (36) to its
default position.
The method of claim 4 wherein steps a-g are controlled by control unit
(52).
