<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color
image forming apparatus in which respective color
toner images formed on an image bearing member having
an electrophotographic photosensitive member are
sequentially transferred onto a transfer material to
provide a color image.In an example of a color image forming
apparatus in which a color image is formed on a
transfer material by superposing multiple color toner
images, a toner image is formed on an image bearing
member through charging, exposure and development, and
the toner image is transferred onto a transfer
material after each color toner image is formed, and
this is repeated for the respective colors, by which a
superposed color image is formed on the transfer
material. Examples of the color image forming
apparatus are disclosed in German Patent No. 2607727,
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 50-50935 or
the like. Figure 4 is a longitudinal sectional view
of an example of such a color image forming apparatus.
As shown, the apparatus is provided with an
electrophotographic photosensitive drum 1 as an image
bearing member. Around the photosensitive drum 1,
there are provided a primary charger 3 in the form of 
a roller electrode, rotary type developing device 4
having a plurality of developing units shown in Fig.5 a transfer
device 10A and a cleaning device 26. Above the
photosensitive drum 1, there is a laser diode 11
constituting an exposure device, a polygonal mirror 13
rotated by a high speed motor 12, and a lens 14 and a
reflection mirror 15.The photosensitive drum 1 comprises an
aluminum cylinder having a diameter of 40 mm and an
organic photoconductor (OPC) thereon. The
photoconductor may be an amorphous silicon, CdS, Se or
the like. The photosensitive drum 1 is rotated in a
direction indicated by an arrow at a peripheral speed
of 100 mm/sec by an unshown driving means.The developing device 4 is provided with a
supporting member 9 rotatable about a shaft 9a, the
supporting member 9 supports an yellow developing
device 4a, a magenta developing device 4b, a cyan
developing device 4c and a black developing device 4d.
The developing devices 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d contain one
component developers, more particularly, yellow toner,
magenta toner, cyan toner, black toner, respectively.In each of the developing devices 4a, 4b, 4c
and 4d, as shown in Figure 6, there is provided a
developing sleeve 8a, 8b, 8c and 8d as the developer
carrying member in the openings 5a, 5b, 5c and 5d. In
each of the developing devices 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d, 
there are
