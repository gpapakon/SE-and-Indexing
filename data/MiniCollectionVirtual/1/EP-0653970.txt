<ABSTRACT>
A chuck (10) for use with a manual or power driver having a rotatable drive shaft. The chuck includes a generally cylindrical body member (16) with a nose section (20) and a tail section (22). The tail section has an axial bore (26) formed therein to mate with the drive shaft of the driver, and the nose section has an axial bore (24) therein and a plurality of annularly disposed passageways (30) formed therethrough and intersecting the axial bore for receipt of a plurality of jaws (18) slidably positioned therein. The chuck further includes a generally cylindrical front sleeve member (12) overlaying the nose section and rotatable with respect thereto. The front sleeve member includes a threaded nut portion (36) integral therewith and in engagement with the threads on the jaws such that when the front sleeve member is rotated with respect to the body member, the jaws will be advanced or retracted, depending on the direction of rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to drill
chucks for use with hand drills or with electric or
pneumatic power drivers. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a chuck of the keyless
type which may be tightened or loosened by hand or by
actuation of the driver motor.Both hand and electric or pneumatic tool drivers
are well known. Although twist drills are the most
common tools used with such drivers, the tools may
also comprise screwdrivers, nut drivers, burrs,
mounted grinding stones and other cutting or abrading
tools. Since the tools may have shanks of varying
diameter or the cross-section of the tool shank may be
polygonal, the device is usually provided with a chuck
which is adjustable over a relatively wide range. The
chuck may be attached to the driver by a threaded or
tapered bore.A wide variety of chucks have been developed in
the art. In the simplest form of chuck, three jaws
spaced circumferentially approximately 120 degrees
apart from each other are constrained by angularly
disposed passageways in a body attached onto the drive
shaft and configured so that rotation of the body in
one direction relative to the shaft forces the jaws
into gripping relationship with respect to the
cylindrical shank of a tool, while rotation in the
opposite direction releases the gripping relationship.
Such a chuck may be keyless if it is rotated by hand.In this respect, GB-A-164,059
on which is based the preamble of claim 1 discloses a chuck of the
kind having a plurality of radially movable jaws slidable
in a grooved body and operated by a rotatable cover, the
endwise sliding movement being imparted to the jaws by
means of screw threads on an interior conical part of the
cover which engage corresponding teeth on the adjacent
outer faces of the jaws, said cover being arranged to rotate
without endwise movement on the body, substantially as
described.Another example of chuck is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 5,125,673 entitled "Non-Impact Keyless Chuck" commonly
assigned to the present 
assignee, and whose entire disclosure is incorporated
by reference herein.Despite the success of keyless chucks such as set
forth in U. S. Patent No. 5,125,673, varying
configurations of keyless chucks are desirable for a
variety of applications. For example, it would be
desirable to have a keyless chuck that requires fewer
components or lower manufacturing cost. In addition,
in particular environments such as, for example, use
in a surgical environment, fewer parts, and specific
preferred materials could be

<CLAIMS>
A chuck (10) for use with a manual or powered driver having
rotatable drive shaft, said chuck comprising:


a generally cylindrical body member (16) having a nose section (20)
and a tail section (22) said tail section having an axial bore formed therein to mate with

said drive shaft of said driver and said nose section having an axial bore formed therein
and a plurality of angularly disposed passageways formed therethrough and intersecting

said axial bore ;
a plurality of jaws (18) slidably positioned in said angularly disposed
passageways, each of said jaws having a jaw face (32) formed on one side thereof and

threads (34) formed on the opposite side thereof;
a generally cylindrical front sleeve member (12) overlaying said nose
section of said body member and rotatable with respect thereto, said front sleeve

member including a threaded nut portion (38) integral therewith and in engagement
with said threads on said jaws such that when said front sleeve member is rotated with

respect to said body member, said jaws will be moved thereby, and said body member
(16) further including a thrust ring (46) having a plurality of jaw guideways (50) to

permit retraction of the jaws therethrough, characterised in that said thrust ring (46) is
intermediate said nose section and said tail section.
A chuck as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said chuck further
comprises a generally cylindrical rear sleeve member (14) fixed on said tail section of said

body member.
A chuck as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that said chuck further includes
means for locking said front sleeve to prevent axial movement, said means for locking

including a portion (62) adapted to matingly engage said rear sleeve member.
A chuck as claimed in any preceding claim, characterised in that the front
sleeve member (12) includes means for preventing axial movement of said front sleeve 

with respect to said body, said means for preventing including protrusions (44) adapted
to contact said thrust ring.
