<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a single-ended through-flow frequency converter with a transformer (5) whose primary winding (51) is connected, via two electronic switches (41, 42) controlled in synchronism and two diodes (43, 44), to an input voltage source. In order to ensure optimum balancing of the switches (41, 42) with lowest-possible losses, the invention calls for a protective circuit consisting only of an inductance acting on the primary-coil side of the main circuit, a series-connected CD circuit (33, 34) and a series-connected LD circuit (31, 32). The throuhg-flow frequency converter is suitable for use in power-supply modules designed to power electrical communications system components and for use in combinatorial circuits.

Single-ended forward converter with a transformer 
(5), which has a primary winding (51) situated in a 

primary-side main circuit of the converter and at least 
one secondary winding (52, 53) situated in an output 

circuit, the primary winding (51) of the transformer (5) 
being switchable to the input voltage source (1) in a 

specified directional sense via two electronic switches 
(41, 42) which can be switched on and off synchronously 

with the aid of switch-on pulses and which are protected 
by a protective circuit, and the primary winding being 

connected to the direct voltage source (1) in the other 
directional sense via two diode current branches whose 

diodes (43, 44) are polarized in the reverse direction in 
relation to the input voltage (U
E
), and an output circuit 
containing a rectifier diode (61, 62), a free-wheeling 

diode (71, 72) and an inductor (81) being connected to at 
least one secondary winding (52, 53) of the transformer 

(5), characterized in that the protective circuit 
provided to protect the electronic switches (41, 42) 

comprises a series inductance (L35) effective on the 
primary side of the transformer and two series circuits, 

of which the one comprises a capacitor (33) and a diode

(51) of the transformer(s), and of which the other 
comprises a diode (32) and an inductor (31) and is 

situated between the junction of diode (34) and capacitor 
(33) of the one series circuit and the terminal, 

connected to the input voltage source (1), of the 
electronic switch (42 or 41, respectively) connected to  

 
the capacitor (33) of the one series circuit, and in that 

the diodes (32, 34) of the two series circuits are

circuit is formed at least in part by an inductor (15, 

35) situated in series with the primary winding (50) of 
the transformer (5). 
Single-ended forward converter according to Claim 
1 or 2, characterized in that the repetition rate of the 

switch-on pulses which render the electronic switches
