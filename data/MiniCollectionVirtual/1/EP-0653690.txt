<ABSTRACT>
A gas turbine engine with dual fuel controls is 
disclosed. The controls have individual sensors that 

monitor e.g. N2. Each control uses the average value of 
N2 from both sensors for providing fuel to the engine 

and performing other operations. The fuel controls 
contain signal processors capable of determining if 

their respective sensors are operating out of range, in 
which case the fuel control uses the value of N2 from 

the sensor associated with the other fuel control. If 
both sensors are out of range, the signal processors use 

a stored value for N2 or a value synthesized from 
another engine parameter. The signal processors are also 

capable of retesting the sensor over successive cycles 
to see if the sensor has corrected and is within a 

tighter range. If the difference between sensor values 
exceeds a range, the sensor with the best value for N2 

is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dual controls, such as
dual fuel controls used with gas turbine engines, and,
in particular, to the use of dual or redundant sensors
to control a common operation, for instance fuel flow.Some gas turbine engines are controlled by two
fuel control systems, each responding to one or more
sensors that provide signals indicating engine operating
conditions, such as high rotor speed N2. Each control is
sometimes called a "channel". Each control has a sensor
to sense the engine operating condition. Ideally, the
sensors are closely matched in their respective output
signal levels. While the outputs do not have to be
exactly the same, if one sensor is "out of the range",
the other controller will try to compensate. Internal,
diagnostic routines may cause the first channel to shut-down.
This takes place more often when the internal
filters in each controller (used to smooth response to
transients) are proportional-integral because the
difference between the sensor outputs increases with
time, producing errors so great that the two channels
would diverge, one being full on the other full off.US-4032757 discloses control apparatus for
controlling an aircraft gas turbine engine having two
control lanes operated in parallel with one another. The
control apparatus includes a computer and a monitor unit
associated with each lane which can determine in which
lane a detected fault lies.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a control system
comprising:
first and second controllers, each controller
comprising a signal processor;means for providing data communication between the
signal processors in each controller; and a sensor connected to the first controller and a
sensor connected to the second controller, each sensor
providing a signal representing the magnitude of a
common parameter to said respective controller, each
signal processor producing a controller output signal
based on the average of the values of the signals
provided by the sensors;
   characterised in that a signal processor produces
a fault signal if said respective sensor provides a
signal outside a first acceptable range, whereupon said
signal processor uses the signal provided by the sensor
connected to the other controller; and
   the signal processor removes the fault signal if
the sensor that caused the fault signal provides a
signal within a second acceptable range during a
plurality of successive tests of the sensor by the
respective signal processor.According to a second aspect of the
