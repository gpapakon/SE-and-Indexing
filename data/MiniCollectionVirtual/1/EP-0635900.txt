<ABSTRACT>
An improved system is disclosed for controlling the operation of a transmit/receive module 
(10) in a phased-array antenna system. The improved module control system of the 

invention is implemented in a simple integrated circuit chip and may be co-located with a 
transmit/receive module (10) positioned at an antenna array element. Either fully distributed 

or row/column distributed beam steering architecture may be implemented by the improved 
module control system with both speed of operation and cost advantages realized 

over prior art systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for controlling active array elements associated with 
phased array antenna systems. In response to increasingly complex antenna illumination requirements, particularly as to 
radar systems, much of the developmental work respecting antenna systems over the last 
two decades has been focused on phased array antenna systems. A phased array is 
essentially the special case of an antenna which, instead of having a continuous aperture, 
has an aperture composed of a number of individual radiating elements. The number of 
such radiating elements in the overall phased aperture may range from a few to many 
thousands, but typically will be at the upper end of that range. Although construction of 
an aperture out of many radiating elements involves a substantial increase in electronic 
and mechanical complexity, as compared to a single continuous aperture, such an array 
antenna system offers the very important advantage that the amplitude and phase of each 
radiating element may be controlled in such a way as to produce a desired aperture 
illumination distribution with substantial flexibility and accuracy. By varying the aperture 
illumination function a considerable variety of beam patterns may be realized from such 
a phased array antenna system and certain non-desirable effects, such as large sidelobe 
levels, may be minimized. For examples of such phased array antenna systems and 
descriptions of how they work, reference is made to the following sources: Radar Handbook, 
edited by Merrill Skolnik, 2d edition, published by McGraw Hill, Inc. (1990) (see 
Chapter 7 entitled "Phased Array Radar Antennas" by Theodore Cheston and Joe Frank.); 
Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design, by Constantine A. Balanis, published by Harper & 
Row, Inc. (1982) (see Chapter 6 entitled "Arrays: Linear, Planer, and Circular"); Antenna 
Theory and Design, by Warren Stutzman and Gary Thiele, published by John Wiley & 
Sons, Inc. (1981) (see Chapter 3 entitled "Arrays", especially section 3.7 entitled "Phased 
Arrays"). Additionally, the flexibility to control the aperture illumination distribution confers another 
important advantage to phased-array systems, in that the illumination function may be  
 
controlled electronically, and thus rapidly, by changing the phase and amplitude of signals 
to or from the individual array elements. This characteristic is significant in allowing such 
an antenna to operate in a multi-function way, such as the performance of interlaced 
surveillance while
