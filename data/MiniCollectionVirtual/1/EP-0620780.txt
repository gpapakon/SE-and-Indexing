<ABSTRACT>
When thin-walled molded bodies (3) made of thermoplastic materials are produced, the foil web (2) shrinks, so that molded bodies cannot be accurately punched out. Before the molded bodies are punched out, therefore, the foil web (2) is severed in at least one spot located between two molded bodies which extend in the perpendicular direction to the advance direction by punching out a foil strip (12) which extends in the advance direction. The now movable molded bodies (3) are then centered and punched out. The device has at least one strip punching tool (150) for punching out a foil strip (12). The strip punching tool (150) is operated in such a way that it severes the foil web (2) before the molded bodies are punched out.
