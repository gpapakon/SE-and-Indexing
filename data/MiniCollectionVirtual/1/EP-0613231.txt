<ABSTRACT>
Known step-up/step-down voltage converters have problems when starting up after switching on, which arise in that the full value of an input voltage (Uin) is applied as soon as it is switched on, whereas no output voltage (Uout) is yet present. Switching logic (UL) recognises the lack of output voltage (Uout) and switches in step-up voltage conversion operation, although step-down voltage conversion operation is correct in this case. In order to eliminate this problem, a decision criterion for forced switching on of step-down voltage conversion operation is introduced. According to the decision criterion, step-down voltage conversion operation is switched on if the input voltage (Uin) is greater than the output voltage (Uout).

Method for regulation of an output voltage (Uout) 
at a predetermined level from a variable input voltage 

(Uin) implemented by means of a step-up/step-down voltage 
converter which uses a regulating signal (Uerr) to derive 

an identification signal for switching over between a 
step-up and a step-down voltage conversion mode, a 

changeover signal (Us) which is at a hierarchically 
superior level than the identification signal, being 

determined from the input voltage (Uin) and a variable 
which at least represents the output voltage (Uout), 

which changeover signal (Us) necessarily causes the step-down 
voltage conversion mode of the step-up/step-down 

voltage converter to be selected when the input voltage 
(Uin) is greater than the output voltage (Uout), characterized 

in that the variable which at least represents 
the output voltage (Uout) is subjected to peak detection 

and subsequent time storage using a predetermined time 
constant of such a value that it is guaranteed that the 

peak value of the peak detection follows the course of 
the peak value of the variable which is subjected to peak 

detection, and in that the time constant is additionally 
set in such a manner that switching pulses of the step-up/step-down 

voltage converter are covered by this time 
constant to an order to magnitude of 10. 
Method according to Claim 1, in conjunction with 
a current-fed push-pull converter as the step-up/step-down 

voltage converter, which has a transformer with a 
primary winding to which a centre tap is assigned on 

which a transformer mean voltage (Um) can be picked off,  
 

characterized in that the transformer mean voltage (Um) 
of the transformer of the current-fed push-pull conve
rter 
is used for the variable, which at least represents the 

output voltage (Uout), for determining the hierarchically 
superior changeover signal. 
Circuit arrangement for regulation of an output 
voltage (Uout) at a predetermined level from a variable 

input voltage (Uin) implemented by means of a step-up/step-down 
voltage converter which has a changeover 

logic (UL) which uses a regulating signal (Uerr) to 
produce an identification signal for switching over 

between a step-up and a step-down voltage converter mode, 
and which has a comparator circuit (VGL) with an output 

for a changeover signal (Us) which is connected to 
circuit parts of the step-up/step-down voltage converter 

in such a manner that the changeover signal (Us) acts in 
a hierarchically superior manner with respect to the 

identification signal and necessarily causes the step-down 
voltage conversion mode to be selected if the input 

voltage (Uin) is greater than the output voltage (Uout), 
characterized in that the comparator circuit (VGL) is 

connected by means of a first input to the input voltage 
(Uin) and by means of a second input to a variable which 

at least represents the output voltage, in that a peak 
detector (D1) and a time store (C1, R3) having a predetermined 

time constant in the order of magnitude of a 
multiple of the switching pulses of the step-up/step-down 

voltage converter is connected to the second input of the 
comparator circuit (VGL) for the variable which at least 

represents the output voltage (Uout).
