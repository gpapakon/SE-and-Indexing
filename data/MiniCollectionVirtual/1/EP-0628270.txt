<ABSTRACT>
A bed wherein the height can be easily and reliably 
changed in several stages with a simplified construction. 

A base part (1) is rotatably provided with a 
supporting link (20) and a receiving link (28) slidably 

housing therein a slider (43). An engageable pin (22) is 
provided in the supporting link (20), the receiving link 

(28) is provided with a guide portion (39), in which a 
plurality of engageable portion (40) are formed at 

predetermined intervals in the longitudinal direction 
thereof, and said engageable pin (22) is slidably inserted 

into said guide portion (39). When said receiving 
link (28) is turned, said slider (43) prevents or permits 

engaging of said engageable pin (22) with said engageable 
portion (40) depending upon the turning direction 

of said receiving link (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bed apparatus according to
the preamble portion of claim 1, which is capable of changing its height.The height of a bed apparatus is normally predetermined.
That is, the height of the bed apparatus is set
to a predetermined height which allows convenient use
for a user having an average physical construction.For example, a user lies or sits on such a bed
apparatus every day. The user repeatedly gets on/off
the bed apparatus every time he lies or sits on the bed
apparatus.Various users such as tall, short, young, old, and
healthy persons and a patient use such bed apparatuses.Of these users, for example, a short person who
tries to sit on a bed apparatus whose mattress surface
is set high is difficult to do so.It is, similarly, to difficult for an old person or
patient to get on/off a bed apparatus whose mattress
surface is set high. In this manner, the optimal height
of a bed apparatus varies depending on users. Strong
demand has arisen for developing a bed apparatus capable
of changing the height depending on the need of a user.To solve this problem, a hospital bed apparatus 
used in a hospital is available. In a height-adjustable
hospital bed apparatus, a complicated link mechanism
mounted on the lower surface of a base is actuated by a
power source to vertically move the base.A conventional bed apparatus capable of changing
its height by means of the power source has a very
complicated structure. For this reason, this bed
apparatus is expensive and can hardly be afforded. Document BE-A-881 294 forming the preamble portion of
claim 1 shows a bed apparatus capable of changing a support
height of a base having an upper surface on which a mattress
is placed. The bed apparatus comprises a support link having
one end portion pivotally coupled to the base, and a reception
link pivotally receiving the other end portion of the support
link. Further, the reception link has one end portion
pivotally coupled to the one end portion of the support link
at a position spaced apart from the one end portion of the
support link by a predetermined distance.The object of the present invention is to provide a
simple, inexpensive bed apparatus capable of facilitating
height adjustment.This object is solved by the features indicated in claim
1. Advantageously developed embodiments of the invention are
subject-matter of the dependent claims 2 to 6.According to the invention, the reception link has a
storage portion surrounded by side walls along a longitudinal
direction, and pivotally

<CLAIMS>
A bed apparatus capable of changing a support height of a
base (1) having an upper surface on which a mattress (2) is

placed, comprising a support link (20) having one end portion
pivotally coupled to said base (1), and a reception link (28)

pivotally receiving the other end portion of said support link
(20), and having one end portion pivotally coupled to said one

end portion of said support link (20) at a position spaced
apart from said one end portion of said support link (20) by a

predetermined distance, 
characterized in that

   said reception link (28) has a storage portion (28b)
surrounded by side walls (29 - 32) along a longitudinal

direction, and pivotally receiving said other end portion of
said support link (20), and further comprising


a guide portion (39) having a plurality of engaging
portions (40) formed on at least one side wall (30) of said

reception link (28) from one longitudinal end to the other
longitudinal end,
an engaging pin (22) formed at the other end portion of
said support link (20), and slidably inserted in said guide

portion (39), and
a slider (43) disposed slidable when a force larger than
the weight of said slider (43) acts on said storage portion

(28b) of said reception link (28), said slider (43)

being slid upon engagement with said engaging pin
(22),
inhibiting to engage said engaging pin (22) with one
of said engaging portions (40) when said engaging pin (22) is

slid from one end to the other end of said guide portion (39),
and
allowing engagement of said engaging pin (22) with
one of said engaging portions (40) when said engaging pin (22)

is slid from said other end to said one end of said guide
portion (39).
A bed apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that
said slider (43) is formed such that a front stepped portion

(45) for preventing said engaging pin (22) from being engaged
with one of said engaging portions (40), and a rear stepped

portion (46) for allowing said engaging pin (22) to be engaged
with one of said engaging portions (40), are formed stepwise,

so that said front stepped portion (45) is directed toward
said other end of said reception link (28) and stored in sai
d
storage portion (28b).
A bed apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that
said slider (43) has a sliding resistance in said storage

portion (28b) in accordance with a spring body (48) disposed
between an end face of said slider (43) and an inner surface

of said storage portion (28b).
A bed apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that
the sliding resistance of said slider (43) which is set by

said spring body (48) is set to be smaller than a moment of
rotation produced during pivotal movement of said reception

link (28) by the weight of said reception link (28).
A bed apparatus according to claim 1, characterized by
comprising two sets of support links (20) at predetermined

intervals in the longitudinal direction of said base (1), each
set having two support links (20) each having one end portion

pivotally coupled to a corresponding position in the widthwise
direction of said base (1), said two support links (20) of

each of said two sets being coupled by a coupling member (42)
so as to pivot with respect to said base (1).
A bed apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that
said guide portion comprises an elongated groove (39) formed

in one side wall (30) of said reception link (28), and each of 
said engaging portions (40) comprises a recess formed in said

one side wall (30) to communicate with said elongated groove
