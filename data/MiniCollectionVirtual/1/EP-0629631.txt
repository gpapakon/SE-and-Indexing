<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel transition
metal compound, an olefin polymerization catalyst
comprising the transition metal compound,
and a process for olefin polymerization using the olefin
polymerization catalyst.A well known homogeneous catalyst is, for example, the so-called
Kaminsky catalyst. Use of this Kaminsky cacalyst
produces a polymer having an extremely high polymerization
activity and a narrow molecular weight distribution.Of the Kaminsky catalysts, ethylenebis(indenyl)-zirconium
dichloride and ethylenebis(4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium
dichloride are known as 
transition metal compounds for preparing isotactic
polyolefins, as described in
JP-A-130314/1986. However, polyolefins prepared
by the use of these catalysts generally have a low
stereoregularity and a low molecular weight.
To prepare polyolefins of high stereoregularity and high
molecular weight using these catalysts,
the polymerization may be conducted at a low
temperature, but this has a problem of low
polymerization activity.It is known that use of hafnium compounds in place of
the zirconium compounds makes it possible to prepare a
polymer having a high molecular weight, as described in
Journal of Molecular Catalysis, 56 (1989), pp. 237-247,
but this process also has a problem of low polymerization
activity. Dimethylsilyl bissubstituted
cyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride is also known and
described in
JP-A-301704/1989 and Polymer Preprints, Japan, vol. 39, No. 6,
pp. 1,614-1,616 (1990), but this compound is not
satisfactory in all of polymerization activity, and
stereoregularity and molecular weight of polymers obtained.In order to solve these problems, various proposals
have been made. For example,
JP-A- 268307/1993 describes an olefin polymerization
catalyst formed from a metallocene compound of
the following formula and an aluminoxane capable 
of preparing a high molecular weight polyolefin, but the molecular
weight of the resultant polyolefin is still insufficient.
Further, EP-A-530 648 describes an olefin
polymerization catalyst formed from a metallocene compound
of the following formula and an aluminoxane.

wherein A is a lower alkyl group.The molecular weight of the polyolefin obtained by the
use of this catalyst is high and industrially satisfactory.
In addition, since the melting point of the polyolefin
(e.g., polypropylene) having high stereoregularity becomes
high, the catalyst is suitably used for preparing a
stereoregular polyolefin having a high melting point.
However, it is unsuitable for
