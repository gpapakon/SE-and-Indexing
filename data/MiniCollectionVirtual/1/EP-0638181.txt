<ABSTRACT>
A data logger includes a housing (20, 22) containing at least one sensor (30, 46); programmable control means (24) including a pre-programmed Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) containing control instructions and sensor drivers for all sensors (30, 46); a Random Access Memory (RAM) (80) providing data storage means for storing data from the or each sensor (30, 46); power means (42); and electro-magnetic transfer means (36, 38) for accessing the logger and for recovering data from the data storage means from external to the casing; the RAM (80) being adapted to accept, from external to the housing and via the electro-magnetic transfer means (36, 38), instructions on the sensor drivers to evoke a desired sampling regime; the logger also including a power up coil (44) is provided within the housing (20, 22) to enable power from external to the housing to be supplied during programming and during recovery of data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data loggers, particularly, 
though not exclusively such tags for use on fish and other marine 
life. In order to develop conservationist fishing strategies fish 
stock management requires information on fish habits and their 
environment. For this many and varied data are required. Whilst it 
is possible to track fish shoals or individual fish fitted with 
suitable transmitters, monitoring positions and aspects of environment 
at the same time, there are clear difficulties involved in this. To 
do such monitoring in the open seas requires the expense of a ship. 
The cost of this is so high that it is usually only possible to afford 
it for a few days at a time. While tracking fish in this way there is 
every possibility that contact with the monitored fish will be lost. 
Thus, even if a continuous watch can be maintained on a fish the 
duration of the watch can only be a small interval in the seasonal or 
life cycle of the species under observation. There is much concern about the depletion of fish stocks. A 
prime requirement in preventing and reversing the depletion trend, 
whilst maintaining reasonable fishing hauls, is a knowledge of the 
behaviour of fish, which would enable conservationist fishing 
strategies to be developed. According to the present invention a data logger includes a 
housing containing at least one sensor; programmable control means 
including a pre-programmed Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory 
(EPROM); a Random Access Memory (RAM) providing data storage means 
for storing data from the or each sensor; power means; and 
electro-magnetic transfer means for accessing the logger and for 
recovering data from the data storage means from external to the 
housing; characterised in that; 
the EPROM contains control instructions, including an operating 
program, and sensor drivers for the or each sensor;  
  in that the RAM is adapted to accept, from external to the 
housing and via the electro-magnetic transfer means, a sensor table 
accessible to the operating program for commanding the appropriate 
sensor driver to operate the required sensor and a sample table 
accessible to the operating program containing instructions on the 
operation of the or each sensor to evoke a desired sampling regime; 
and in that  a power up coil is provided within the housing to enable power 
from external to the housing to be supplied during programming and 
during recovery of data.   The control instructions in the EPROM preferably also include a 
communications

A data logger including a housing (20, 22) containing at least one 
sensor (30, 46); programmable control means (24) including a 

pre-programmed Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM); a 
Random Access Memory (RAM) (80) providing data storage means for 

storing data from the or each sensor (30, 46); power means (42); and 
electro-magnetic transfer means (36, 38) for accessing the logger and 

for recovering data from the data storage means from external to the 
housing (20,22); characterised in that; 


the EPROM contains control instructions, including an operating 
program, and sensor drivers for the or each sensor (30, 46); 
in that the RAM (80) is adapted to accept, from external to the 
housing and via the electro-magnetic transfer means (36, 38), a sensor 

table accessible to the operating program for commanding the 
appropriate sensor driver to operate the required sensor and a sample 

table accessible to the operating program containing instructions on 
the operation of the or each sensor to evoke a desired sampling 

regime; and in that 
a power up coil (44) is provided within the housing (20, 22) to enable 
power from external to the housing to be supplied during programming 

and during recovery of data. 
A data logger as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that the 
instructions in the EPROM include a communications program. 
A data logger as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 characterised in 
that the control instructions in the EPROM include a test procedure 

program. 
A data logger as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 characterised 
in that the housing (20, 22) is waterproof. 
A data logger as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4 characterised 
in that the power means are in the form of electric cells (42). 
A data logger as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 characterised 
in that logger is designed to protect stored data by switching to a 

disabled state automatically once it has completed a sample table, 
when the mass data store is full, or when it detects that the power 

supply is low.
