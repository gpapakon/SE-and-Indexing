<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to industrial 
vehicle wheels having a rim and a tire with an inflation 
valve comprising a tubular body fixed at one end to the rim 
and extending substantially parallel to the rim axis and 
adjacent to an area of the inner wall thereof. More particularly, the invention refers to wheels of the 
above-mentioned type whose rim is intended, in use, to 
contain a disk brake unit. During operation of vehicles 
provided of such wheels, and in particular in case of travel 
along gravelly roads, the problem arises related to the 
risk, anything but infrequent, of damaging or sometimes 
shearing the tubular body of the valve. This risk is due to 
the fact that, when travelling on gravelly roads, the 
crushed stones penetrating within the rim through the 
ventilating holes of the wheel and/or from the inner side of 
the rim, accumulate on the lower part therof and, during 
rolling of the wheel, are trailed upwardly by the valve 
body. When the crushed stones reach the disk brake unit, 
they tend to get stuck for instance within the transverse 
spaces of the brake caliper and to deflect the tubular body 
of the valve. Since such body is cantilever secured at one 
and thereof to the wall of the rim, it can be easely sheared 
with the consequent need of replacing the tire. It is known in the art, from US-A-1.624.974 which shows a 
protection device according to the preamble of Claim 1, a protection 
system for the inflation valve of a tire, formed by a shield 
located at the inner side of the rim and extending 
transversely thereof. This shield is constituted by a sheet 
metal channel-shaped body permanently fixed to the rim by 
means of rivets.  
 Similar solutions are known also from GB-A-277.654 and DE-U-93 
02 971. The above known solutions are generally of a complicated 
construction and do not ensure the necessary protection of 
the valve in the aforesaid conditions. Moreover, these known 
devices are specific for a certain type of wheel and can not 
be readily adapted to wheels of different types, nor can be 
easily removed in case of need (for instance in case of 
inspection of the valve), nor can be conveniently applied to 
already existing wheels. The object of the present invention is to overcome the above 
drawbacks in a simple, functional and economic way. In order to achieve the above object, the present invention 
provides a protection device for inflation valves of 
industrial vehicle tires, in particular for wheels of the 
type set forth at the beginning,

<CLAIMS>
Protection device for inflation valves (V) of 
industrial vehicle tires, particularly of wheels (R) having 

a rim (C) intended to contain in use a disk brake unit, and 
wherein the inflation valve (V) comprises a tubular body (T) 

fixed at one end (E) to the rim (C) and extending 
substantially parallel to the axis of the rim (C) and 

adjacent to an area (S) of the inner wall (P) thereof, 

characterized in that
 it comprises a ring (1) adapted to be 
adjustably and releasably locked against the inner wall (P) 

of the rim (C) in axial correspondence of the area of the 
tubular body (T) of the inflation valve (V) and provided 

with a channel element (10) intended to be positioned 
astride of said tubular body (P). 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
ring (1) is constituted by a metal strap (2) and in that the 

said channel element (10) is formed by a bent portion of 
said strap (2). 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
said channel element (10) has a rounded profile. 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 said ring (1) is open and is provided 
with an adjustable closure device (5) for varying the 

diameter of the ring (1). 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein said area of the rim (C) adjacent to which the 

tubular body (T) of the inflation valve (V) extends, has an 
annular depression (S), 
characterized in that
 the ring (1) 
is provided with outer positioning blocks (11), angularly 

spaced from one another for engagement within said annular 
depression (S) of the rim (C).  

 
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that
 it further comprises a stiffening band 
(12) fixed to said ring (1) against the channel element 

(10). 
Device according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 said 
stiffening band (12) and said ring (1) are rigidly connected 

to each other by two pairs of lateral walls (13, 14) 
defining respective box-like structures placed on opposite 

sides of said channel element (10).
