Device for injection of liquid, consisting of a hand 
piece (1) containing on the one hand a pneumatic jack (15) 

designed to push a catapult (16) bearing an injection needle 
(21) against a return spring and on the other hand a removable 

syringe (23) containing the liquid and connected to the needle 
(21) and also with a pneumatic device (35) to push a piston 

(29) which is movable in the syringe (23), the jack (15) and 
the pneumatic device (35) being supplied by one and the same 

container (2) which is equipped on the one hand with a 
pressure reducer (11) which delivers a gas at constant 

pressure to the jack (15) and on the other hand with an 
orifice of variable cross-section which delivers gas under 

adjustable pressure to the pneumatic device (35), 
characterised in that the orifice of variable cross-section 

forms part of a second pressure reducer (30) which delivers 
gas at stable and adjustable pressure to the pneumatic device 

(35), and that the hand piece (1) contains the container (2), 
the pressure reducer at constant pressure (11) and the second 

pressure reducer (30). 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the 
said container (2) forms a handle of the hand piece (1). 
Device as claimed in one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the container (2) includes an autoclave non-return 

valve (8) which is pushed from the exterior by a spring (10) 
which raises the valve (8) and drains the container (2) for 

any internal pressure lower than a predetermined minimum 
pressure. 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the hand piece (1) includes a push-button 

manual valve (14), pushing of which ensures the supply 
of the jack (15) for pushing the catapult (16) and release of  

 
which ensures the exposure to the open air of the said jack 

(15). 
Device as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that the 
exposure of the pushing jack (15) to the open air is 

accomplished through a small orifice (28) in order to slow 
down the return of the needle (21). 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the catapult (16) is borne coaxiall
y by 
the pneumatic jack (15) and by an end guide (18) near the 

needle (21). 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it comprises a means for stopping the 

flow of liquid over the connection (22) between the syringe 
(23) and the needle (21). 
Device as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that the 
said connection is a flexible conduit (22), and that the 

stopping means include a gripping piece (25) with a spring 
(26) which brings about a flattening of the conduit (22), and 

that an opening pusher (27) parts the gripper (25), against 
the spring (26), at the end of the travel of the catapult (16) 

pushed by the jack (15). 
Device as claimed in Claim 8, characterised by a 
transverse slot (24) produced in a fixed tube (20) surrounding 

the catapult (16), the said fixed tube (20) containing the 
sliding gripping piece (25) which is pushed back at the end of 

the travel of the pneumatic jack (15) in order to release from 
gripping the flexible conduit (22) which was previously 

introduced into the slot (24). 
Device as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that the 
gripping piece (25) includes a narrow peripheral projection  

 
(25') in order to flatten the flexible conduit (22) over a 

weak surface. 
Device as claimed in Claim 8 or Claim 9, characterised 
in that the gripping piece (25) actuates a rod (40) passing 

with a small clearance through a fixed tube (20) in order to 
flatten the conduit (22) outside the said tube (20). 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised by a non-return valve (32) interposed between 

the first pressure reducer (11) and the pneumatic device (35). 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the pneumatic device is a pressure 

chamber (35) which co-operates in a sealed manner with the 
flange (34') of the syringe (23) for direct pushing of the 

piston (29) after the syringe (23) filled with liquid has been 
fixed on the said chamber. 
Device as claimed in Claim 13, characterised in that the 
syringe (23) includes a piston with a rod (36) for drawing in 

liquid which has weak necked areas (36') which allow it to be 
broken, in such a way that it is possible to throw away the 

part of the rod (36) which emerges from the syringe after it 
has been filled and before it is fixed on the pressure chamber 

(35). 
Device as claimed in Claim 13, characterised in that 
the syringe (23) includes a free piston (29'), and that 

filling thereof is effected by pulling of the rod (38') of a 
piston of the assembly (38) which is contiguous with the free 

piston (29') and is removed before the filled syringe is fixed 
on the pressure chamber (35). 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 15, 
characterised in that the syringe (23), the needle (21) and  

 
the connection (22) thereof form a disposable assembly which 

cannot be dismantled. 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 16, 
characterised by a tubular piece (37) surrounding and 

protecting the needle (21) when the catapult (16) is not in 
action, the said piece (37) being indented at one end and 

fitted by the other end around a guide (19) of the catapult 
(16). 
Device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 17, 
characterised in that the syringe (23) is borne by the 

catapult (16) to which the pressure chamber (35) is fixed.
