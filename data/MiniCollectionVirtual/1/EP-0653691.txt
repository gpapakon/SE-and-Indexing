<ABSTRACT>
A pressure regulator for fluids comprising a flexible 
measuring element; an interception element (17, 19) and 

a loading or reaction element (20) acting on the 
measuring element (17, 18). Said loading element is 

solidly connected to a part of said measuring element 
(17, 18) and has a configuration which renders it 

elastic, or is elastic-flexible in itself, whereas the 
body (10) of the regulator has a portion (22) resting 

against said elastic loading element (20) which may be 
deformed permanently by applying a pressure in order to 

vary the preload of said elastic element and therefore 
the force it exerts on the measuring element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pressure regulators
in general.The pressure regulators used in supplying gases or
other fluids have the fundamental task of automatically
keeping supply pressure constant for user appliances,
even if and when the pressure above the regulator
and/or user absorption vary.Pressure regulators, particularly those so-called
"self-acting", comprise the following components inside
a body provided with an inlet passage and an outlet
passage for the fluid:
a flexible measuring instrument designed to detect
any pressure variations inside the regulator, including 
a membrane supported by a plate and anchored
peripherally in the body of the regulator, an interception element for varying flow rate
according to any pressure variations as detected by the
membrane and stopping fluid supply through the
regulator, between the inlet and outlet passages,a loading or reaction element, usually a spring,
acting on said measuring flexible element for
calibration thereof.In traditional pressure regulators, the
interception element comprises a rocking lever which is
connected, at one end, to the measuring element
(membrane) and, at the other end, supports a stopper
associated with a hole provided in the body, between
the inlet and outlet passages for the fluid. The
loading or reaction spring acts perpendicularly on the
measuring element and its preload may be adjusted
through calibration means mounted on the body of the
regulator.Some more recent pressure regulators comprise
loading or reaction springs with fixed preloads, so as
to eliminate any calibration and adjustment means;
however, such springs require high precision in
construction and behaviour.In another embodiment of the pressure regulator,
the rocking stopper is eliminated and the measuring 
element itself functions as an interception element. In
this case, a portion of the membrane functions as a
stopper associated with a hole provided in the body,
between the inlet and outlet passages for the fluid, so
as to vary the opening thereof according to the
displacement of the membrane as a result of the
pressure exerted by the fluid supplied.Starting from such prior art, it is an object of
the present invention to provide a pressure regulator
which is particularly simple and functional, with
reasonable manufacturing costs and production times, in
which the number of components is even more reduced as
a result of certain improvements applied to the
measuring and loading or reaction elements and to the
preload adjusting means of the loading or

<CLAIMS>
A pressure regulator for fluids comprising the
following components inside a body (10) provided with

an inlet passage (14) and an outlet passage (15) for
the fluid to be supplied:


a flexible measuring instrument designed to detect
any pressure variation inside the regulator and

including a membrane (17) supported by a plate (18) and
anchored peripherally in said body,
an interception element (17, 19) for varying inlet
flow rate according to any pressure variations as

detected by the membrane and stopping fluid supply
between the inlet and outlet passages,
a loading or reaction element (20) acting on said
measuring flexible element (17, 18) for calibration

thereof, characterized in that said loading element
(20) is rigidly connected
 to a part of said measuring
element (17, 18) and has a configuration which renders

it elastic, or is elastic/flexible in itself, and in
that said body (10) has a portion (22) resting on said

elastic loading element (20) which may be deformed
permanently by applying a pressure in order to vary the

preload of said elastic element and consequently the
force it exerts on the measuring element.
A pressure regulator as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said loading element (20) comprises at least

one flexible band or tongue (21) connected to the
measuring element (17, 18) at one end, and resting

against the permanently deformable portion (22) of said
body at the other end.
A pressure regulator as claimed in claims 1 and
2, wherein said flexible band or tongue (21) is wavy or

pleated, so as to be elastic as a result of elastic
variation of angulation at its waves or pleats.
A pressure regulator as claimed in the previous
claims, wherein the flexible band or tongue (21) is

made from the same material as the plate and is
integral with the plate itself.
A pressure regulator as claimed in claims 1-3,
wherein the flexible band or tongue (21) and said plate

are from the same or from a different material, and the
flexible band or tongue (21) is fixed to the plate or

to the membrane.
A pressure regulator as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said elastic element (20) comprises an element

of variable length, elastically integral with the plate
or with the membrane.
A pressure regulator as claimed in claims 1 and
2, wherein the permanently deformable portion (22) of 

the body (10) is a wall having adequate thickness and
form located at the top of the body itself.
A pressure regulator as claimed in the previous
claims, wherein the measuring flexible element (17,18)

has a portion (19) which functions as a stopper and as
an interception element as well.
