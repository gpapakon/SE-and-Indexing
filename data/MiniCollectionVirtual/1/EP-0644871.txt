<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in a 
process for the preparation of p-aminophenol from 
nitrobenzene. The compound p-aminophenol (PAP) is an important 
chemical intermediate used in the preparation of the 
analgesic acetaminophen. A number of other derivatives 
having a wide variety of industrial applications may 
also be prepared from PAP. One method for preparing 
PAP involves the catalytic hydrogenation of 
nitrobenzene in an acid medium. In this process, 
phenylhydroxylamine is first formed, and this 
intermediate promptly rearranges in the acid reaction 
medium to form PAP. Henke, et al. (U.S. Patent No. 2,198,249) 
reportedly were the first to disclose a process for the 
preparation of PAP by the catalytic hydrogenation of 
nitrobenzene in an acid medium. A number of process variations have since been 
disclosed. For example, Spiegler (U.S. Patent No. 
2,765,342) studied the reaction extensively. Among the 
factors explored by Spiegler was the effect on 
reduction rate and p-aminophenol yield of including a 
surfactant selected from among quaternary ammonium 
compounds and several non-quaternary compounds. Among 
the quaternary ammonium compounds used was dodecyl  
 
trimethylammonium chloride. The non-quaternary 
compounds investigated include two simple tertiary 
amine salts: triethylamine sulfate and tributylamine 
sulfate, as well as dioctadecyl propyleneamine 
dioleate. From a plot of rate and yield data, Spiegler 
concluded that the rate/yield performance of all of the 
quaternary ammonium compounds examined was superior to 
that of the non-quaternary compounds. Later, Brown et al. (U.S. Patent No. 3,535,382) 
reported that certain nonionic polyether polyol 
surfactants could be substituted for Spiegler's 
quaternary ammonium compounds. R.G. Benner (U.S. Patent No. 3,383,416) used the 
Henke et al. approach of charging all the nitrobenzene 
at once, but used a carbon-supported platinum catalyst 
and quaternary ammonium surfactant, preferably dodecyl 
trimethylammonium chloride, as disclosed by Spiegler. 
Benner purposely interrupted the hydrogenation well 
before all the nitrobenzene had been consumed. In the 
presence of two liquid phases, aqueous and 
nitrobenzene, a carbon-supported platinum catalyst is 
preferentially wetted by the nitrobenzene, so most of 
the catalyst is suspended in the nitrobenzene layer, 
permitting the removal of the upper aqueous solution of 
PAP and aniline by decantation. The PAP is then 
recovered from the aqueous layer and purified. While Benner
