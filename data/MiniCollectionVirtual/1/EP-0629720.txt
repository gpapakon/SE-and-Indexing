<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spinning process for
the preparation of thermoweldable polyolefin fibers, in
particular polypropylene based fibers, suitable for the
preparation of nonwoven fabrics.Said nonwoven fabrics are particularly suitable for uses
requiring considerable softness and tear resistance, as is the
case with coverstock for diapers and sanitary wear, which are
made from low count fibers, generally ranging from 0.2 to 5
dtex, or with also membranes, made from fibers having a count
between 3 and 10 dtex. The fundamental requirement of
polyolefin fibers for nonwoven fabrics is that they must bond
to each other by means of the joint action of temperature and
pressure on which the hot calendering processes are based.
This characteristic, called "thermoweldability", is not always
present in polyolefin fibers, or at least not in the same
degree. In fact basically thermoweldability depends on the
type of polyolefin being span, the additives it contains, the
type of process and the spinning conditions used.Published European patent application 391438 describes
polyolefin compositions suitable for spinning and characterized
by the presence of stabilizers selected from organic phosphites
and/or phosphonites, HALS (Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers)
and optionally phenolic antioxidants.The same patent application describes thermoweldable
fibers obtained from the above mentioned stabilized polyolefin 
compositions by conventional spinning processes, in particular
processes for the production of staple fibers. In this case
the good levels of thermoweldability shown in the examples are
due to the selection of the stabilizers. In the above
mentioned examples fibers having a count ranging from 1.9 to
2.2 dtex are prepared by using a typical "long-spinning"
apparatus (characterized, among other things, by high fiber-winding
speed) equipped with a die having holes with 0.4 mm
diameter.Using a die whose holes have a small diameter (less than
or equal to 0.4 mm) to produce low count fibers is typical of
both the above mentioned long-spinning apparatus, as well as
the "short- spinning" apparatus both used for producing staple
fibers, and of the spun-bonding machines, because it enables
high production levels to be obtained.In fact, the smaller the diameter of the holes, the higher
the numbers of holes in the die, which means more fibers per
unit of time. This is the reason why in the art the use of
dies with diameters of the holes greater than 0.4 mm is limited
to the production of high-count fibers (higher
