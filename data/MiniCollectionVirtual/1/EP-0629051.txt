<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for
checking errors in digital information, for the
correction of single errors (SEC) detection of double
errors (DED) of single byte multiple errors (SBD) and
the correction of an odd number of single byte errors
(ODD SBC).To improve the reliability of computer memory
systems error-correcting codes (ECC) have been widely
used to ensure protection against intermittent,
permanent and transitory failures.SEC-DED codes have been proposed for use in memory
systems organised on the basis on one bit per chip.In this way any failure in a single memory
component can influence at most only a single bit of
the digital information, hereinafter defined as
acodeword.Standard memory device technology is moving
towards ever higher levels of integration and multiple-bit-per-chip
memory organisations are becoming common. In this case a failure in a memory component or
chip can generate different types of error:
a failure of a single cell can generate a single
error, but an overall chip failure can simultaneously
generate an error of several bits, up to a maximum of
b, where b is the number of bits simultaneously
extracted from the individual memory component.Therefore, in a memory organisation of b bits per
chip, a chip failure can generate a "byte error" that
is an error configuration consisting of from one up tob
error bits, in dependence on the type of failure: cell
failure, word line failure, bit line failure, or
partial or total chip failure.The SEC-DED codes are not suitable for memories
having b bits per chip since multiple errors are not
correctable and the uncorrectable error (UE) rate can
become high in the case of chip failure resulting in a
high number of multiple byte errors.Another serious problem is constituted by the loss
of data integrity due to the fact that a multiple
errorcould be wrongly corrected by a SEC-DED code.To reduce the uncorrectable error rate and
increase the data integrity there have been proposed
different codes with the ability to detect multiple
byte errors (or even correction of multiple byte 
errors).In this connection the following publications can
be cited:
