<ABSTRACT>
This invention includes methods for analyzing data generated by various solid-state NMR experiments, including rotational echo double resonance (REDOR), transferred echo double resonance (TEDOR), dipolar recoupling at the magic angle (DRAMA), dipolar recoupling with a windowless sequence (DRAWS), and melding of spin-locking and DRAMA (MELODRAMA). The methods are based alternately on a new analytical transform or the maximum entropy method and their multidimensional extensions. They permit simultaneous, multiple distance measurements of high accuracy and precision, even from nuclei with identical chemical shifts. By providing high quality easily obtained distance measurement from disordered solid state materials, this invention also improves drug discovery and design through fast determination of structures of pharmaceutical lead compounds, drug molecules, or their targets.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent disclosure, as it appears m the Patent and Trademark Office patent files and records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.This invention was made with United States Government support under award number 70NANB5H1066 awarded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.1. FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe field of the invention is the analysis of data generated by nuclear magnetic resonance ("NMR") spectroscopic measurements of molecules to produce data relating to mternuclear separations within the molecule. The invention has particular application to guick and accurate determinations of molecular structure in the field of drug design by use of the new NMR and signal processing techniques.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe search for new and better drugs motivates the need for faster and more accurate methods of molecular structure determination. Pharmaceutical companies need to discover and commercialize new pharmaceuticals quickly and efficiently.While the need for new drugs has increased in recent years, the productivity of drug discovery and development has not markedly improved. Despite a more that ten-fold increase in research and development spending by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries between 1976 and 1994, the number of new molecules approved by the FDA for pharmaceutical use remained relatively constant in the range of 12-30 per year 

throughout this period. The time spent on discovery, development, and commercialization of new pharmaceutical molecules has remained constant at 10-12 years per drug. There is a need to shorten the time and reduce the cost of drug discovery.To understand better the problems in the drug discovery, consider the current state of the art. Evidence from molecular biology points to the interaction of proteins with their targets as a fundamental biological mechanism underlying the normal state and numerous diseased states. For example, artheriosclerosis (the principal cause of heart attack and stroke) and cancer, responsible for greater than 50% of the mortality in the U.S., are triggered by the disordering of specific protein-protein recognition events. Early approaches to drug design depended on the
