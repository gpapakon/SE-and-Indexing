 HOSE COMPOSITIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a composition suitable for use in hoses, including automotive radiator coolant hoses, air conditioning hoses and steam hoses; and hoses comprising the composition.2. Description of Information DisclosuresHoses made from synthetic or natural rubbers and methods for producing the hoses are known. Hoses used to conduct fluids to and from automotive radiators are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,096,888; U.S. Patent 4,698,890; and U.S. Patent 4,158,033, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference.Although there are many commercially available types of automotive radiator hoses, there is still a need to improve the properties of these hoses, such as resistance to water or coolant diffusion, heat resistance and compression set.Rubber based steam hoses are also well known in the art. One problem with such hoses is that 

moisture often permeates the rubber portion of the hose. When the moisture is cooled and then reheated, the trapped moisture can cause the formation of blisters or partial blowouts. This effect is known as "popcorning".Because of its good impermeabilities, halogenated butyl rubber has been used for steam hoses in an effort to reduce this popcorning effect. There exists, however, a continuing need for hose compositions with improved impermeability and heat reistance.It has now been found that hoses that are made from a composition comprising certain halogen- containing copolymers of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene containing a critical amount of the para-alkylstyrene moiety and a critical amount of chemically bound halogen have improved properties.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with the invention, there is provided a hose composition comprising: (1) a halogen- containing copolymer of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene, said copolymer comprising at least about 5 weight percent of said para-alkylstyrene, and at least about 0.4 mole percent of said halogen; (2) a component selected from the group consisting of a filler, a rubber compounding additive and mixtures thereof; and (3) a curing agent.In accordance with the invention, there is also provided a vulcanized elastomeric hose comprising an inner tube, a reinforcing member and an outer 

cover, wherein at least a portion of said hose comprises a composition comprising: (1) a halogen- containing copolymer of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene, said copolymer comprising at

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A hose composition comprising:
(1) a halogen-containing copolymer of a
C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene, said copolymer comprising at least about 5 weight percent of said para-alkylstyrene, and at least about 0.4 mole percent of said halogen;
(2) a component selected from the group consisting of a filler,a rubber compounding additive, and mixtures thereof; and (3) a curing agent.
2. The vulcanized hose composition of claim 1.
3. The hose composition of claim 1, wherein said copolymer is present in an amount ranging from about 35 to about 65 weight percent; said component (2) is present in an amount ranging from about 35 to about 65 weight percent, and said curing agent is present in an amount ranging from about 0.5 to about 5 weight percent, based on the total hose composition.
4. The hose composition of claim 1, wherein said copolymer comprises from about 5 to about 20 weight percent of said para-alkylstyrene.
5. The hose composition of claim 1, wherein said copolymer comprises at least about 0.5 mole percent of said halogen. 


 6. The hose composition of claim 1, wherein said halogen comprises bromine, and wherein said bromine is chemically bound to said para-alkylÂ¬ styrene.
7. The hose composition of claim 1, wherein said isomonoolefin is isobutylene and said para- alkylstyrene is para-methylstyrene.
8. A vulcanized elastomeric hose comprising an inner tube and an outer cover, wherein at least a portion of said hose comprises a composition comprising:
(1) a halogen-containing copolymer of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-alkylstyrene, said copolymer comprising at least about 5 weight percent of said para-alkylstyrene, and at least about 0.4 mole percent of said halogen; and
(2) a component selected from the group consisting of a filler, a rubber compounding additive, and mixtures thereof.
