<ABSTRACT>
A fire-resistant glazing for avoiding fire and smoke from passing through, in the event of a fire, from one room into another uses at least one fire-resistant pane (1) which is constructed in a number of layers and exhibits protective layers (1d) which can be activated by the action of heat, and, furthermore, fastening means which retain and protect the fire-resistant pane (1) are provided. In order to reduce the number and the surface area of the heat bridges between the two sides of the fire-resistant glazing, the fire-resistant pane (1) is provided with a through-passage opening (9) which has a supporting part (8) of the fastening means passing through it. The through-passage opening (9) is slightly larger than the supporting part (8) arranged therein, and the interspace which is formed in this manner is filled completely with a composition (12) suitable for transmitting pressure, e.g. a synthetic-resin composition.

Fire resistant glazing to avoid flames and smoke 
passing from one room into another in the event of a 

fire, using at least one pane of fire resistant glass 
which is made up of many layers and has protective layers 

which can be activated by the effect of heat, and having 
a fastening which holds and supports the pane of fire 

resistant glass, characterized in that the pane (1) of 
fire resistant glass is provided with a passage opening 

(9) through which a supporting part (8) of the fastening 
passes, the passage opening (9) being slightly larger 

than the supporting part (8) arranged therein, and the 
gap formed in this way being completely filled with a 

substance (12) suitable for transmitting pressure. 
Fire resistant glazing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the supporting part (8) is 

connected on both sides to flat pieces (5, 7), the inner 
surfaces of which are supported on the flat sides of the 

pane (1) of fire resistant glass, preferably with interposition 
of a fireproof sealing layer (6). 
Fire resistant glazing according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that each fastening comprises at least 

three passage openings (9), each having a supporting part 
(8), the at least three supporting parts (8) being 

connected on both sides to flat pieces (5, 7) common to 
all supporting parts (8). 
Fire resistant glazing according to Claim 2 or 
Claim 3, characterized in that the length of the supporting 

part (8) exceeds the thickness of the pane (1) of 

fire resistant glass.  
 
Fire resistant glazing according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the passage opening (9) and 

the supporting part (8) are of cylindrical design. 
Fire resistant glazing according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized by a substance (12) based on 

synthetic resin.
