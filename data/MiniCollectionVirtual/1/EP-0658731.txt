<ABSTRACT>
In an absorption machine, some of the primary devices (absorbers or generators (1)), acting at higher pressure, are placed on a rotary system (29) which can be driven in rotation continuously or periodically; the solution reaches the devices placed on the rotary system (29) via feed conduits (45) partly or completely integral with the rotary system (29), the solution leaves the devices placed on the rotary system (29) via delivery conduits (49) partly or completely integral with the rotary system (29). This arrangement makes it possible to achieve the effect, when the rotary system (29) is kept in rotation, that some or all of the pressure rise in the solution reaching the primary devices, acting at higher pressure and placed on the rotary system (29), takes place in the conduits (45) integral with the rotary systems and for feeding these devices, without the use of traditional pumps, and to achieve the effect that some or all of the pressure reduction of the solution leaving the primary devices, which act at higher pressure and are placed on the rotary system, takes place, with recovery of the pressure energy of the fluid, in the conduits (49) integral with the rotary systems and for delivery from these devices, without the use of traditional turbines.

Thermal absorption machine which can be used as a
refrigerating machine or as a heat pump, comprising

primary appliances such as one or a plurality of
"generators" (1) and "condensers" (2) and "absorbers" (3)

and "evaporators" (4), circuits (8,58,61,65) by means of
which these appliances exchange heat with the exterior,

an appropriate quantity of refrigerant fluid, an
appropriate quantity of absorbent substance, conduits

(57) for passage of the vapour of the refrigerant fluid
from the generator to the condensers, conduits (5) for

passage of the rich solution from the absorbers to the
generators, conduits (59) for passage of the lean

solution from the generators to the absorbers, conduits
(56) for passage of the refrigerant liquid fluid from the

condensers to the evaporators, conduits (62) for passage
of the vapour of the refrigerant fluid from the

evaporators to the absorbers, which may also include one
or a plurality of heat exchangers, for example for

exchanging heat between the rich solution and the lean
solution (6), or between the refrigerant fluid in the

liquid state and the same in the vapour state (63),
hydraulic valves or motors for obtaining a reduction in

the pressure of the fluids which evolve in the machine
(54,60,64), separators (9) for rectifying the vapour

which emerges from the generators with the relative
cooling circuits (10), pumps in order to obtain an 

increase in pressure in the fluids which evolve in the
machine (7,36,52), one or a plurality of rotary systems

(29), drive systems (30) which can cause these rotary
systems to rotate, means (34,35) for the passage of one

or a plurality of fluids from the fixed conduits to the
conduits integral with the rotary systems and vice versa

in which certain of the absorbers, if these are absorbers
which operate at higher pressure, or certain of the

generators, if these are generators which operate at
higher pressure and a portion at least of the relative

supply and lift conduits (45,49) are placed on certain of
the rotary systems, characterised in that the primary

appliances acting at lower pressure are fixed, and in
that, when the rotary systems are kept in rotation, the

solution which passes from the fixed primary appliances
to other primary appliances operating at a higher

pressure and placed on these rotary systems, moves away
as a whole from the axis of rotation of the systems, and

increases as a whole its own pressure by the effect of
the mechanical work accomplished on the solution by the

conduits integral with these rotary systems through which
it 
passes, and in that, when the rotary systems are kept
in rotation, the solution which passes from the primary

appliance is placed on these rotary systems to other
fixed primary appliances operating at a lower pressure,

approaches as a whole the axis of rotation of these
systems and as a whole reduces its own pressure by the

effect of the mechanical work which the solution carries
out on the conduit integral with these rotary systems

through which it passes. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterised in that
all the primary appliances operating at higher pressure

are placed on rotary systems.
Machine according to claim 2, characterised in that
the primary appliances operating at higher pressure and

placed on rotary systems (29) are generators (1).

in certain of the generators among those placed on rotary

systems, thermal exchange is carried out principally in
zones (116) of the generator placed at a sufficiently

great distance from the axis of rotation of these r.otary
systems so that the pressure of the solution in these

zones does not permit evaporation of the refrigerant
fluid, and in that evaporation of the refrigerant fluid

occurs successively, in zones (117) of the generator in
which the solution approaches the axis of rotation of the

rotary system and consequently reduces its own pressure.
