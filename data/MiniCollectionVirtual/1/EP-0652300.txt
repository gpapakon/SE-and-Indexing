<CLAIMS>
A method of thermal treatment for forming an austenitic skin with ≥ 0.30 % by wt. of dissolved nitrogen in near to final shape components of X5 CrNiMo 17 12 2 or X2 CrNiMoN 22 5 3 in the form of stainless steel by nitriding at a temperature between 1000 and 1200°C in a nitrogen-containing gas atmosphere and subsequent cooling at such a speed that nitride deposition is prevented.
A method of thermal treatment as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the pressure in the gas atmosphere during the nitriding process differs from normal pressure.
A method of thermal treatment as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the skin is hardened by subsequent re-heating to a temperatures 650°C.
