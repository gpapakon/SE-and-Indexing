<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle seat (10) which carries a passenger restraint system, namely a lap belt (30) and a shoulder belt (28), with a tension load carrying member (64) being provided to resist forward rotation and bending of the backrest frame (14) during a frontal vehicle collision when the shoulder belt (28) is loaded in tension. The tension load carrying member (64) forms a truss structure with the frame back portion (42) and the frame base portion (36). However, during normal vehicle operation, the tension load carrying member (64) is detached from the frame back portion (42) eliminating the truss structure and the need for a more complex recliner mechanism for adjusting the position of the backrest (14). A grip mechanism (76, 80) is provided to attach the load carrying member (64) in response to a high shoulder belt (28) load to complete the truss. In an alternative embodiment, the load carrying member (130) is released from the backrest (14) only during adjustment of the backrest (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle seat of the type which carries a shoulder belt coupled
to the backrest and in particular to such a seat having a load carrying member which couples to the
backrest frame to form a truss structure to resist forward rotation of the backrest during a vehicle collision
and releases to enable adjustment of the backrest angle.Motor vehicles are typically provided with an occupant restraint system comprised of belts which,
for front seat occupants, includes a lap belt and a shoulder belt. These belts restrain an occupant within
a vehicle seat. Most often, the belt restraint system is mounted directly to the vehicle structure adjacent
to the vehicle seat. The position of the vehicle seat, relative to the vehicle body, is adjustable in at least
the fore and aft direction and may be adjustable in other directions as well. When the belt restrain system
is mounted to the vehicle, the seat is moved relative to the belt restraint system such that it can become
inconvenient or uncomfortable for a seat occupant to use the belt restraint system. For example, if the
vehicle seat is moved to its forward most position, it may be difficult to reach rearward to grasp the belt
mounted to the vehicle behind the seat. Furthermore, in this forward most position, the shoulder belt may
rub across the occupant's neck, creating discomfort.One example of a restraint which is mounted to the vehicle but which incorporates an improved
system over a conventional fixed mounting system is disclosed in the published European Patent
Application EP-A-0 154 883 (corresponding to the preamble of claim 1), which provides a device for preventing the forward displacement of seat
belted persons, including but not limited to motor vehicles, consisting of, an occupant seat slidable on a
carrier, a 3-point belt and a self-locking retractor fastened to a vehicular body component, it is supposed
to be prevented that, forward displacement endangering the body should occur to one of the seat belted
passengers during an accident because of belt slack present in the seat belt system and belt stretching
occurring under the influence of force, whereby an impact of the passenger on the vehicular mountings
in front of him/her is to be simultaneously excluded. It is proposed for this purpose, that the occupant
seat be coupled by a mechanism triggered during an accident by a sensor on the vehicle and slidable
backwards, and a clamping device movably directed toward a vehicular body component, for the belt
webbing.Accordin
