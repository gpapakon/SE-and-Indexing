<ABSTRACT>
A holder for elongate articles for secure holding of 
the articles, which may be produced inexpensively and 

installed easily and flexibly on a rod shaped part (1) is 
provided comprising at least one partially open collar (3, 

3') which may be closed by a closure member (2) for 
receiving the article, of which there is at least one; at 

least one strap-like elastic portion (4), wherein at least 
one portion has a free end (4) of which the surface has 

teeth (4') on at least one side in a partial region; and a 
lock region (5) which can engage with the textured surface 

of the free end (4) of the strap-like portion (4), wherein 
the lock region (5) is integrated into the collar (3, 3') of 

which there is at least one.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holder for elongate
articles, in particular for Bowden cables on a bicycle
wherein the holder may be mounted on a partially rod-shaped
part of the bicycle.An arrangement for installing Bowden cables on a
bicycle is known from the Gebrauchsmuster G 91 07 185.2, to
which reference will be made in this application and in
which T-studs are welded onto the frame by the known stud
welding process and holders are pushed onto these T-studs.
These holders are secured against radial and axial removal
and have recesses which extend longitudinally at the sides
and are designed such that Bowden cables of a specific
diameter may be pressed into the recesses. The holders have
a tab which is articulated longitudinally at the sides, is
pivotal for holding the Bowden cables over the recesses and
the anti-removal device and is held on the holder by means
of a detachable locking device.However, fastening by means of T-studs has various
drawbacks in bicycles. For example, bicycle frames are
increasingly produced from aluminium with which conventional
welds cannot be produced. Furthermore, the position of the
holder is determined by the T-stud during the process of
welding on the T-stud and cannot therefore be altered by the
user. The rigid T-stud does not allow positional alignment
in a subsequent assembly process. The mounting of a T-stud
is relatively time-consuming, demands complex machinery and
is therefore correspondingly expensive.An object of the invention is to provide a holder for
elongate articles which guarantees secure holding of the 
articles, may be produced inexpensively and may be installed
easily and flexibly.This object is achieved with a holder having the
features of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the holder
are described in the sub-claims.The holder is a connecting means between at least one
elongate article and a partially rod-shaped part. The
elongate articles are typically smaller in cross-section
than the rod-shaped part and may be arranged flexibly
relative to it. The holder is particularly well suited to
Bowden cables which are to be fixed on a frame part of a
bicycle. The portion of the Bowden cable held by the holder
and the frame part then typically extend substantially in
parallel at the fastening point.In an embodiment of the invention, the holder has at
least one partially open collar for receiving the article,
of which there is at least one, the collar being closable by
a closure member. The opening of the collar is sufficient
to enable the article
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A holder for at least one elongate article (17, 17'),
in particular for Bowden cables on a bicycle, which may be

mounted on a substantially rod-shaped part (1), wherein the
holder comprises:


at least one partially open collar (3, 3') for receiving the article end
a closure member (2),

   characterised in that the holder further comprises:

at least one strap-like elastic portion (4) having a
free end, the surface of said portion (4) having teeth (4') on at

least one side for part of its lenght;
a lock region (5) which can engage with the teeth (4')
of the strap-like portion (4),
said lock region (5) being integrated into at least one
collar (3,3') and having
a lead through (6) with an outlet orifice (6'), in
which lead through (6) an elastically movable locking head

(7) is arranged for guiding the free end of the strap-like
portion (4), said lock region (5) may be closed by the closure member (2).
A holder according to claim 1, characterised in that
the holder has two collars (3,3') and the lock region (5) is

integrated between these two collars.
A holder according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised
in that the lock region (5) has, in the vicinity of the 

outlet orifice (6') of the lead through (6), a surface (5')
which is substantially perpendicular to the lead through.
A holder according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the lead through (6) in the lock

region (5) extends substantially perpendicularly to a
surface with which the lock region (5) may be applied to the

rod-shaped part (1).
