<ABSTRACT>
The fuel injection pump has at least one cylinder (3) and a piston (4) axially movable therein. The piston has a first control edge (5), determining the start of delivery of the pump, and a second control edge (7), determining the end of delivery of the pump, the two control edges interacting with an orifice (6) situated in the wall of the cylinder (3), which orifice is connected to an intake port (12) and a transfer port (13). The cylinder (3) is arranged axially movable between two limit positions in a pump housing (1). For holding the cylinder in its one limit position, a hydraulic force (chamber 25) acts on it, which can be cancelled when the cylinder is to assume its other limit position.

A fuel injection pump for a reciprocating internal 
combustion engine, having a pump housing (1), which 

comprises an inlet chamber (11), an intake duct (12) and 
a outlet duct (13), having a cylinder (3) forming a 

delivery chamber (8), which is disposed between two end 
positions in an axially movable manner in the pump 

housing and in at least one wall comprises a radially 
directed through-bore (6), which is in communication with 

the intake duct and the outlet duct, and having a piston 
(4), which is disposed axially movably in the cylinder 

and also has a first control edge (5), which determines 
the commencement of delivery of the pump, and a second 

control edge (7), which determines the end of delivery of 
the pump, with both control edges interacting with the 

through-bore (6), and with the cylinder (3) being 
retained by pressurisation in one end position and being 

displaceable by pressure compensation into the second 
position,
characterised in that
 to retain the cylinder (3) in the 
second position pressurisation is also provided on the 

end face of the cylinder (3) on the side of the cylinder 
(3) faced towards the driving side of the piston (4), 

with this end face being smaller than the end face faced 
away from the driving side of the piston, in order to 

displace the cylinder (3) towards the driving side of the 
piston when there is equal pressurisation of the end 

faces. 
A pump according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a pressure chamber (25) is provided 
on the side of the cylinder (3) faced away from the 

driving side of the piston (4),
and in that
 a control circuit opens into the pressure 
chamber in order to supply the cylinder (3) with pressure 

medium. 
A pump according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a pressure chamber (15) is provided 
on the side of the cylinder (3) faced towards the driving 

side of the piston (4),
and in that
 a control circuit opens into the pressure 
chamber (15) in order to supply the cylinder (3) with 

pressure medium. 
A pump according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the cylinder (3) is disposed with 
the end face (18) faced towards the driving side inside 

the inlet chamber (11) in the housing (1). 
A pump according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a control circuit comprises a 
supply line (17) for the pressure medium,
and in that
 the supply line opens into the pressure 
chamber (15) in order to supply the pressure chamber 

continuously with pressure medium. 
A pump according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the control circuit is connected to 
a pressure-providing source, e.g. inlet chamber and pump 

respectively. 
A pump according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 a hydraulic control circuit having 
a reversing valve (21, 32, 38) is provided in order to 

control the cylinder (3) by the supply or removal of 
pressure medium or fuel.
