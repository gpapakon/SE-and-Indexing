<ABSTRACT>
A continuous packaging sleever assembly for wrapping 
packaging sleeves onto and about groupings of product 

containers in a packaging operation has a frame structure 
(11) having a generally horizontal working surface area; 

conveyance means (13) to move the product containers 
across said working surface; a horizontally movable flight 

bar assembly (15,45) having a plurality of flight bars 
connected to continuous means (19) and having a continuous 

conveyance path through the packaging operation, said 
flight bar assembly being constructed and arranged to be 

selectively movable in a generally perpendicular direction 
to said product conveyance means (13) and to separate 

product containers into predetermined groups (26); a 
packaging sleeve placement structure (27) in 

synchronisation with said flight bar assembly (15) and for 
depositing packaging sleeves (21) between and above said 

flight bars of said flight bar assembly and above the 
product groups (26); and means (29) to wrap and close said 

packaging sleeves above the product groups. The means to 
wrap and close include a side compression closing flight 

structure (29) having segmented chain support rails (74), 
a continuous lugged chain structure (78), and pressure 

control means (73) connected to said segmented chain 
support rails (74) and being operative on said packaging 

sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a machine assembly 
for wrapping packaging sleeves about product groups. 
Particularly, this invention relates to a packaging sleever 
assembly for packaging individual product groups 
from a continuous product stream. The assembly 
separates the product stream into product groups and wraps and 
secures packaging sleeves about the individual product groups. A continuous packaging sleever assembly according to the features 
of the preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-2 751 730. Various machines have been proposed and 
used to continuously package selected product groups. These 
machines have typically comprised packaging 
machinery components and structures which separate the product 
stream into product groups, which provide a packaging 
structure, such as a sleeve, to each product group and which 
secures the packaging structure about the group to form 
finished units. Each prior art machine and process, however, accomplishes 
the wrapping and securing of packaging structures about the 
product groups in its own particular manner and uses specific 
structures to preselect and separate the product groups. 
Particularly, the manner in which the packaging structures are 
placed with respect to the product groups and subsequently 
secured about them varies significantly. The machine 
structures and processes utilized, often are dictated by the 
size and configuration of the individual products, the desired 
product group size and, particularly, they depend upon the  
 
physical structure and configuration of the packaging 
structures to be utilized. Packaging speed, accuracy and 
economy being the hallmark for each machine structure and 
process. For example, Applicant's assignee, as disclosed in U.S. 
Patents 4,530,686, and 4,802,324, respectively, teach a Rotary 
Carton Placer and a Vertical Cartoning Assembly and Method for 
use in the packaging of product groups. Patent '686 discloses 
a carton placer which operates by driving one or more 
planetary gear driven article transfer mechanisms about a 
stationary gear and which causes the vacuum cups, for example, 
to travel in rotational paths having apex or outward positions 
of travel. At these apex positions various cooperating 
structures can be positioned, such as an article storage 
magazine or a moving conveyor. The '324 Patent discloses a vertical cartoner assembly 
and method for placing and assembling cartons over preselected 
product groups moved on a conveyor. In its operation, a 
rotary carton placer, as disclosed

<CLAIMS>
A continuous packaging sleever assembly for wrapping 
packaging sleeves onto and about groupings of product 

containers in a packaging operation comprising: 

a) a frame structure (11) having a generally horizontal 
working surface area; 
b) conveyance means (13) to move the product containers 
across said working surface; 
c) a horizontally movable flight bar assembly (15,45) 
having a plurality of flight bars connected to 

continuous means (19) and having a continuous 
conveyance path through the packaging operation, 

said flight bar assembly being constructed and 
arranged to be selectively movable in a generally 

perpendicular direction to said product conveyance 
means (13) and to separate product containers into 

predetermined groups (26); 
d) a packaging sleeve placement structure (27) in 
synchronization with said flight bar assembly (15) 

and for depositing packaging sleeves (21) between 
and above said flight bars of said flight bar 

assembly and above the product groups (26); and 
e) means (29) to wrap and close said packaging sleeves 
above the product groups, 
 
characterised in that said means to wrap and close include 

a side compression closing flight structure (29) having 
segmented chain support rails (74), a continuous lugged 

chain structure (78), and pressure control means (73) 
connected to said segmented chain support rails (74) and  

 
being operative on said packaging sleeves. 
The sleever assembly of Claim 1, wherein an infeed 
section is provided in alignment with said conveyan
ce 
means and wherein an outfeed section is provided in 

alignment with said conveyance means. 
The sleever assembly of Claim 1
,
 wherein said flight 
bar assembly (15,45) is comprised of a pair of continuous 

chains (19;50,51) having slidable flight bar structures 
mounted thereto and being constructed and arranged to 

engage between individual products to select product 
groups (53). 
The sleever assembly of Claim 1
,
 further comprising 
a product selector mechanism for providing selected 

product groups (53), and wherein said flight bar assembly
