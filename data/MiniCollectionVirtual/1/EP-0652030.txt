<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a guide (10, 10a, 16', 62) for 
the diagonal part (8) of a seat-belt running over the back of a 

seat of a vehicle or vessel, having a guide element which 
encloses the belt and is fitted on the top edge of the seat 

back at a distance from the upstanding outer edge thereof, by 
means of which a better lie for the diagonal part of the belt 

is obtained when said belt is being worn by a child, in 
particular when said child is sitting on a raised child's seat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a guide for the diagonal 
part of a seat-belt running over the back of the seat of a 
vehicle or vessel, comprising a guide element disposed near 
the top end of the belt and enclosing the belt. Such a guide is known per se and is used, for 
example, for seat-belts in which the end lying near the 
outside of the vehicle ends, at the floor of the vehicle, 
in an automatic blocking mechanism; the guide element is 
then fitted on a vehicle body column and may or may not be 
adjustable in height. Where diagonal belts are used by children, and in 
particular when the child is sitting on a raised child's 
seat, the problem with the conventional diagonal belts is 
that the centre of gravity of the upper part of the child's 
body lies above the contact zone where the diagonal belt 
part rests against the upper part of the body. This means 
that, when the vehicle reduces speed abruptly, the upper 
part of the child's body shoots out over the diagonal belt 
part and bents forwardly, so that the performance of the 
belt is very inadequate. The object of the invention is to overcome this 
drawback. This object is achieved according to the 
invention through the feature that the guide element is 
fitted on the top edge of the seat back and at a distance 
from the outside edge thereof. When the belt is being used by a child, and is then 
run through the guide element, the diagonal belt part will 
run higher over the upper part of the child's body, with 
the result that the contact zone is displaced upwards and 
will coincide with the centre of gravity of the upper part 
of the body. The abovementioned drawback is in this way 
overcome. Preferred embodiments of the invention are 
described in the sub-claims. The invention is explained with reference to the 
drawing. Herein shows: 
Figure 1 a perspective front view of a child 
sitting on a raised child's seat, in which by a solid line  
 
the diagonal part of the corresponding seat-belt combined 
with the guide according to the invention is indicated, and 
the conventional situation is indicated by a dashed line; Figure 2 partially in view, and partially in 
section, a first embodiment of the guide according to the 
invention; Figure 3 partially in view and partially in section 
a second embodiment of the guide according to the 
invention; Figure 4 partially in view and partially in section 
a third embodiment of the guide according to the invention. Figure 1 shows schematically a vehicle or vessel
