<ABSTRACT>
A method for synthesizing alkyl tertiary-alkyl ether which 
comprises reacting a C₄-C₁₀ tertiary alcohol with a C₁-C₆ 

primary alcohol in the presence of a catalyst comprising a 
pentasil zeolite having a silica/alumina ratio of 30-350, 

optionally in the presence of a binder consisting 
essentially of an oxide of an element from Group III or IV 

of the Periodic Table. A primary alcohol and tertiary 
alcohol are contacted in a molar amount of from 10:1 to 

1:10 over said pentasil zeolite catalyst at a temperature 
of 20°C to 250°C and a pressure of 0.1 to 7.0 MPa 
>
 B. The 
process is suited to the production of MTBE or ETBE.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the synthesis of alkyl t-alkyl 
ether using pentasil zeolite catalysts. In 
particular, this invention concerns an improved process 
for preparing 
ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE) in one step by the 
reaction of tertiary butanol and ethanol in 
the presence of a catalyst comprising a pentasil zeolite, 
specifically one having a Si/Al ratio in the range 
30-350 and preferably a Si/Al ratio in the range 50-150, 
optionally with a binder consisting essentially of an 
oxide from Group III or IV of the Periodic Table. The 
invention is especially advantageous in that the 
pentasil zeolites exhibit high activity during methyl 
t-butyl ether synthesis from methanol and t-butanol or 
ethyl t-butyl ether synthesis from ethanol plus 
t-butanol and, additionally, allow for the cosynthesis 
of isobutylene and diisobutylene. It is well-known that there is pressure to 
eliminate lead compounds from fuels for reasons of 
public health and environmental protection. Although 
the specifications for reformulated gasolines set by 
United States EPA will come into force in 1995, 
standards were brought into force in November 1992 
requiring gasoline to contain at least 2.7 wt% oxygen 
during the winter in nonattainment areas of the U.S. If 
the federal air quality standard for CO was not achieved 
by a specified attainment date, the minimum oxygen 
content would increase to 3.1%. Moreover, starting in  
 
the summer of 1992, the maximum blending Reid vapor 
pressure (BRvp) of all gasolines was set at 0.06 MPa 
(9.0 psi). Since oxygenates are not only used as 
gasoline blending components, extenders, octane boosters 
and as key ingredients for reducing the emissions of CO 
and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), it is expected 
that the demand for oxygenates will increase enormously 
in the coming years. See F. Cunill, et al., "Effect of 
Water Presence on Methyl tert-Butyl Ether and Ethyl 
tert-Butyl Ether Liquid-Phase Synthesis". IND. ENG. 
CHEM. RES. 1993, 32, 564-569. Of all oxygenates, the tertiary ethers, such as 
methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether 
(ETBE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) are preferred 
by refineries to lighter alcohols. They have lower 
blending Ried vapour pressure (BRvp), lower vaporization 
latent heats and low solubilities in water. The most 
common ether in use today is MTBE with a production of 
about 25 million metric tons. However, ETBE is becoming 
more attractive as the price of methanol goes up in 
relation to gasoline. It can be produced from
