<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dust bag, as well as to 
a method of producing a dust bag. In recent years, the suction performance of vacuum 
cleaners has increased constantly. As a result, the 
air flow sucked into the dust bag through the inlet 
opening thereof is so strong that the particles taken 
along in the air flow to be cleaned may damage the dust 
bag when impinging on the inner surface thereof. This 
risk of damage to the bag of the vacuum cleaner is 
particularly high at the inner surface of the dust bag 
opposite the inlet opening. Further, such dust bags 
are particularly prone to damages, in which the 
inflowing air impinges obliquely onto the inner surface 
of the dust bag opposite the inlet opening; in such 
dust bags, the inner surface portion opposite the inlet 
opening is blown clean by the inflowing air so that no 
dust or particles can gather there which could protect 
the inner surface from damage. From FR-A-1 167 874 a dust bag is known the wall of which 
consists of air-permeable portions as well as of impermeable 
portions. The impermeable portion prevents particles 
from penetrating into the wall of the dust bag when 
they hit it. Accordingly, the impermeable wall portion is 
arranged opposite to the inlet opening of the dust bag. 
The impermeable wall portion is connected with the air-permeable 
wall portion along its entire edge region.  
 From European Patent 0 161 760 A2, a dust bag is 
known having a filter bag consisting of a three-layered 
fiber material composite. An inner layer of 
polypropylene micro fiber is disposed between two outer 
supporting layers of high strength. The two outer 
layers consist of a nonwoven web of nylon fibers that 
are welded together. These outer layers are of a 
relatively high strength both in the machining 
direction and transversally thereto. However, since 
this known dust bag has two fiber layers of high  
 
strength, seen over its entire wall, it is 
comparatively expensive to produce. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a dust bag that is protected from damage by 
sucked particles and may be produced at low cost. The object is solved by a dust bag comprising the features of claim 1. 
The subclaims relate to preferred embodiments of the invention. The dust bag of the present invention has a filter bag provided with 
an 
air-permeable filter material and having two wall 
portions that are connected or closed at their 
respective opposite edges so as to form the filter bag.

<CLAIMS>
A dust bag comprising: 

a filter bag (28;60) having an air-permeable 
filter material, said filter bag having two wall 

portions (30, 32;52,54) that are connected at 
longitudinally opposing edges (36,51) so as to 

form said filter bag (28;60), 
an inlet opening (22;56) for allowing the air to 
be filtered to enter said filter bag (28;60), 

said inlet opening (22;56) being provided in one 
of said wall portions (30,32;52,54), and 
a protective layer (38;48) resistant to mechanical 
stresses caused by particles carried in 

the air flow and protecting said filter material, 
said protective layer (38;48) being arranged 

on the inner surface of the other of said 
wall portions (30,32;52,54) and extending at 

least over the surface area thereof opposite 
said inlet opening (22;56) between two interconnected 

edges (36,51) of said wall portions (30, 
32;52,54) between which it is held, said edges 

(36,51) defining the longitudinal dimension of 
said filter bag (28,60), 
characterized in that
said protective layer (38,48) is of an air-permeable 
material and 
said protective layer (38;48) is in the form of 
a protective strip being narrower than the wall 

portions (30,32;52,54), the longitudinal ends of 
said protective strip being positioned and held 

only at the longitudinally opposing interconnected 
edges (36,51) of said wall portions (30, 

32;52,54). 
The dust bag of claim 1, characterized in that said 
protective layer (38;48) is a non-woven web of 

firmly interconnected thermoplastic polymer fibers 
that are welded together and have a low weight and 

a high strength. 
The dust bag of claim 1, characterized in that said 
filter material is a filter paper material. 
The dust bag of claim 1, characterized in that said 
filter material is a single or multiple-layer composite 

with synthetic fiber material. 
The dust bag of claim 4, characterized in that said 
wall portions (30,32) are welded together at their 

edges (36) and that the melting temperature of the 
material of the protective layer (38) is higher 

than the melting temperature of the synthetic fiber 
filter material. 
A method for producing a dust bag according to 
claim 1, wherein 


a first web (42) of air-permeable filter material 
is supplied, 
a second layer (48) of an air-permeable material, 
resistant to mechanical stresses caused by 

particles carried in the air flow and protecting 
said first web (42) filter material, is supplied 

together with said first web (42), said second 
web being narrower than said first web, 
said first web (42) is formed such that its two 
longitudinal edges overlap and the first web
