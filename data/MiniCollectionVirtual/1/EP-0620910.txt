<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for launching projectiles, such as fireworks projectiles, which explode in the air into a pyrotechnic display. The projectile includes a shell constructed from a binding agent and an explosive additive which explodes the shell into small particles. The explosive additive, which may be nitrocellulose, causes the exploded particles to be rapidly burned and consumed to form lightweight, inert flakes that fall harmlessly to the ground. The projectile is aimed and launched by a launcher using a compressed gas to rapidly expel the projectile from a launching tube. Once in the air at a predetermined location in the sky, an electronic fuse inside the projectile operates to detonate the projectile into its intended pyrotechnic display. The fuse is extremely accurate and enables detonation of the pojectile at precise altitudes. An electronic control system controls launching and detonation of the projectiles in a precise and repeatable manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fireworks 
displays and, more particularly, to a new method and 
system of presenting precision fireworks displays with 
a decreased environmental impact. "Pyrotechnics" is the "science of fire." 
Pyrotechnic displays, commonly referred to as fireworks 
or fireworks displays, have been created and enjoyed for 
centuries by millions of people. Over the years, the 
systems and methods for creating the displays have 
remained substantially unchanged. The fireworks systems of the prior art are 
comprised essentially of two main components, namely a 
pyrotechnic projectile and a mortar for directing the 
pyrotechnic projectile into the air. The pyrotechnic 
projectile itself consists of two principal components, 
comprising an initial burst and a main burst. Black 
powder is one of the oldest pyrotechnic propulsion 
agents and it is typically used as the initial burst and 
main burst component. The main burst also includes 
pellets of color composition known as "stars." Igniting 
the stars during detonation of the main burst provides 
the light and color of the fireworks display. Common pyrotechnic projectiles comprise an 
inner shell and an outer shell. To preserve the main 
burst until aerial ignition, the main burst is enclosed 
within the inner shell, wh-ile the initial burst is 
enclosed within the outer shell. The pyrotechnic  
 
projectile also has two fuses in the form of an initial 
fuse and a main fuse. The main fuse extends from the 
initial burst in the outer shell to the main burst in 
the inner shell. The initial fuse extends from the 
initial burst to the exterior of the outer shell. By 
igniting the initial fuse, the initial burst is exploded 
and propels the pyrotechnic projectile from the mortar 
into the air. Contemporaneously, the main fuse is lit 
because the end of the main fuse protrudes into the 
initial burst. The main fuse then takes a specific time 
to burn into and ignite the main burst. The pyrotechnic projectile can take on various 
shapes. For cylindrical shells, the main burst includes 
stars which are randomly packed. Upon detonation of the 
main burst, the shell opens, and the stars are ignited 
in an irregular visual pattern. For round shells, the 
main burst consists of the stars arranged around a 
central core of black powder. When the main burst of 
the round shell is ignited, the stars are distributed in 
a round, symmetrical pattern. Sometimes the shell will 
contain a flash-and-sound powder, instead of stars, to 
produce a flash of
