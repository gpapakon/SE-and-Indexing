<ABSTRACT>
A method for concentrating a clay slurry by subjecting the slurry to indirect heat exchange within a heat exchanger to elevate the temperature of the slurry whilst specifically suppressing boiling of the liquid within the heat exchanger. The heated slurry is subsequently subjected to a rapid pressure reduction cause flash evaporation of part of the liquid. The rapid pressure reduction can occur in a separation vessel or a flash vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE: EVAPORATIVE CONCENTRATION OF CLAY SLURRIESField of the InventionThis invention relates to the evaporative concentration of clay slurries, and more particularly to an improved method and apparatus for concentrating beneficiated clay slurries by an evaporation process. Background of the InventionClay slurries, such as Kaolin, are beneficiated in an aqueous slurry having a low solids content. The most widely used method of dewatering such slurries after beneficiation involves initial processing in a vacuum or pressure filter to remove a first portion of the water from the slurry, typically to a level of about 50% to 70% solids. The resultant filter cake is then subjected to direct contact evaporation, usually by means of a spray dryer, to increase the solids content to about 95% to 99%. As has already been recognised in the disclosure of United States Patent 4,687,546 Willis, assigned to Georgia Kaolin Company Inc., the concentration of beneficiated clay slurries by spray drying is an inefficient method of evaporating the water from the slurry which requires the use of relatively clean hot gases to contact the slurry spray. This patent describes the use of non-contact or indirect evaporative heat exchangers to remove the water from the slurry. The specification of this patent claims that this method of processing the slurry avoids the problems of agglomeration which are prevalent with spray drying and results in a Kaolin product of improved brightness. As a result of test work conducted by the present applicant to evaluate the concentration of Kaolin slurries by evaporation using standard techniques of free boiling and natural circulation, it is believed that the use of evaporative heat exchange techniques in the concentration of Kaolin slurries will result in the formation of a thick skin on the surface of the Kaolin slurry and a build up or accretion of high solids slurry on the heat exchange 

 surfaces even at relatively low solids levels (40% to 45%) . When this technique of free evaporation was tested in a long tube vertical evaporator,, it was quickly found that plugging of the tubes rapidly occurred and concentration could not effectively be achieved as a continuous process even when low solids slurries were processed at high specific circulation rates. Summary of Invention and ObjectIt is an object of the first aspect of the present invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for the concentration of clay slurries in which the problems associated with the use of indirect
