<ABSTRACT>
The composition, which is for the skin, is stable. This composition contains retinol in the solubilised state in an organic solvent which is liquid at room temperature, chosen from the group consisting of:     i) branched-chain C16-C20 aliphatic fatty alcohols, ii) alkoxylated saturated unbranched- or branched-chain C16-C20 fatty alcohols,   iii) diesters of C6-C14 dicarboxylic acids and isopropyl alcohol  and mixtures of the abovementioned solvents. This composition is intended for the treatment of skin complaints, and especially acne.

<CLAIMS>
Anhydrous, stable, retinol-based cosmetic or
pharmaceutical composition for the skin, characterized

in that it contains retinol in dissolved form in an
organic solvent, which is liquid at room temperature,

chosen from the group consisting of:

i) branched-chain C
16
-C
20
 aliphatic fatty
alcohols,
ii) straight- or branched-chain alkoxylated C
16
-C
20

saturated fatty alcohols,
iii) diesters of C
6
-C
14
 dicarboxylic acids and of
isopropyl alcohol and mixtures of the said

solvents.
Composition according to Claim 1, characterized
in that it is free of any antioxidant.
Composition according to either of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the retinol is

present in a proportion of between 0.001 and 15% and
preferably between 0.01 and 10% by weight relative to

the total weight of the composition, the remainder
consisting essentially of the organic solvent.
Composition according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the branched-chain

C
16
-C
20
 aliphatic fatty alcohol is chosen from
isostearyl alcohol, 2-hexyldecanol and octyldodecanol.
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the straight- or branched-chain

alkoxylated C
16
-C
20
 saturated fatty alcohol is
stearyl alcohol oxypropylenated with 15 mol of

propylene oxide. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the diester of C
6
-C
14

dicarboxylic acid and of isopropyl alcohol is
diisopropyl adipate.
Packaging in two parts, characterized in that
the first part consists of a composition according to

any one of Claims 1 to 6 and in that the second part
consists of a conventional cosmetic or pharmaceutical

support, the two parts leading to the formation of a
milk on mixing together at the time of use.
