<ABSTRACT>
A socket for electrically connecting a circuit panel (14) 
to a substrate comprises an an insulative housing (10) 

defining an elongated slot (12) for receiving the circuit 
panel (14). A plurality of terminal receiving cavities (16) 

are spaced apart along a length of the slot, and each of the 
cavities is open to the slot on opposite sides (22, 24) 

thereof. The housing (10) includes a rib (20) extending 
beneath the slot along its length. A plurality of 

electrically-conductive terminals (30) are disposed in 
respective ones of the cavities (16). Each of the terminals (30) 

comprises an integral body including a housing engaging 
section (32) having opposed surfaces (34, 36) each gripping a 

respective opposite side (46, 48) of the rib (20). Each 
terminal has a lead (58) extending to an exterior of the 

housing (10) for electrically engaging a substrate, and a pair 
of resilient contact arms (52, 62) extending into the slot 

(12) from respective opposite sides of the slot (12) for 
electrically engaging opposite sides of the circuit panel 

(14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a socket for electrically 
interconnecting circuit panels, and more particularly, to a 
housing and terminals for a cam-in socket wherein the 
terminals are retained in the housing by gripping opposite 
sides of a rib of the housing, thereby providing a low profile 
socket. A single in-line memory module (SIMM) presents a high 
density, low profile single in-line package for electronic 
components such as dynamic random access memory integrated 
circuit components. Each module comprises a plurality of 
integrated circuit components mounted on a circuit panel card 
having contact surfaces adjacent one edge. A plurality of 
these circuit panels, or daughtercards, can then be mounted on 
a circuit board mothercard. Sockets known as SIMM sockets are well known to receive 
the edge of a circuit panel daughtercard and establish an 
electrical interconnection with a circuit board mothercard. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,946,403 discloses a SIMM socket which 
permits a circuit panel to be inserted into the socket with a 
low insertion force. This patent also discloses a right angle 
SIMM socket for mounting the daughtercard parallel to the 
mothercard in order to reduce overall height of a packaged 
daughtercard/mothercard assembly. A problem with right angle 
mounting is that the mothercard must have a relatively large 
surface area to accommodate a plurality of daughtercards. U.S. Patent No. 5,041,005 discloses a low profile SIMM 
socket which permits mounting a daughtercard at an angle such 
as twenty-five degrees relative to the mothercard. This 
socket permits a plurality of daughtercards to be mounted in 
parallel side by side relationship while still providing a 
relatively low overall height for the packaged assembly. In order to achieve a still denser array of daughtercards 
on a mothercard, it would be advantageous to narrow the SIMM 
sockets in order that they could be mounted on the mothercard 
in closer parallel relationship. Width of the sockets is 
primarily limited by the profile of the terminals which must  
 
be housed therein. Each of the above-reference patents 
discloses a socket housing having a central rib which 
extends beneath a panel receiving slot along a length of the 
housing. The patents disclose terminals which are retained 
in their respective socket housings by two separate and 
spaced apart retention elements, one of the elements 
engaging on the central rib, and the other of the elements 
engaging an inner surface of an outer wall of the housing.

<CLAIMS>
A low profile socket for electrically connecting a 
circuit panel (14) to a substrate (18), comprising an 

insulative housing (10) having an elongated slot (12) 
arranged for mounting the circuit panel in inclined relation 

to the substrate, a plurality of terminal receiving cavities 
(16) spaced apart along the slot, each of the cavities being 

open to the slot on opposite sides thereof, a plurality of 
electrically conductive terminals respectively disposed in 

the cavities, and a rib (20) extending beneath the slot 
along the length thereof, each of the terminals being an 

integral body including housing engaging means (32), a lead 
(58) extending to an exterior of the housing for 

electrically engaging the substrate, and a pair of resilient 
contact arms extending into the slot from opposite sides of 

the slot for electrically engaging opposite sides of the 
circuit panel, characterised in that the housing engaging 

means of each terminal is formed by a section (32) of the 
integral body defining a slot (40) having opposed surfaces 

(34,36) gripping opposite sides of the rib (20), and neither 
of the contact arms is preloaded against the rib 

(20),whereby contact portions of the contact arms avoid 
picking up smears of plastic from the rib (20) as the 

terminal is inserted into the housing. 
The socket according to claim 1, wherein the rib (20) 
is centrally disposed beneath the slot (12). 
The socket according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a 
surface of the rib (20) defines at least a portion of a 

boundary wall (26) of the slot (12). 
The socket according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein each 
of the contact arms (52,62) has a profile that extends from 

a fixed origin (53,63) upwardly to a highest portion and 
then downwardly to a circuit panel contact portion. 
The socket according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein 
each of the contact arms (52,62) has a profile that defines 

at least two bends.  
 
The socket according to claim 5, wherein each of the 
contact arms (52,62) is substantially C-shaped. 
The socket according to any preceding claim, wherein 
one of the opposed surfaces (34,36) of the housing engaging 

section includes a barb (42).
