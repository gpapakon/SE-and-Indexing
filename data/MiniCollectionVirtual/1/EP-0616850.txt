<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel design and arrangement of scraper elements for document shredders with cutting rollers arranged in pairs, the former being mounted on supporting rods. According to the invention, a variable number of scrapers are arranged at the bottom and top of the cutting mechanism, having special easy-assembly designs for mounting on the supporting rods and being arranged together with the supporting rods so as to reduce blockages and friction.

Document shredder with a cutting roller pair as well as 
individual strippers which are lined up on retaining rods and which 

extend, while engaging between the cutting discs, substantially from 
the lower and the upper cutting mechanism outer side up to the 

respective roller core and preferably have spherical stripping 
regions, characterised by the following features: 


a) A stripper (7) is arranged at the lower cutting mechanism side 
in each cutting roller gap (S) formed each time between two 

adjacent cutting discs (1 or 2) by the meshing-like engagement 
of a cutting discs (1 or 2) of the oppositely disposed cutting 

roller (3 or 4); whilst provided at the upper cutting mechanism 
side are individual auxiliary strippers (9), which however do 

not engage in each cutting roller gap (S) of the two cutting 
rollers (3, 4), but preferably only in each fourth to fifth gap 

(S); 
b) The holding rods (6) for the strippers (7) are arranged spaced 
at a spacing (L) from the respective outer diameter of the 

cutting discs (1 or 2) for the formation of gaps, wherein the 
spacing (L) preferably amounts to twice to ten times the width 

of the cutting roller gap: 
c) Each auxiliary stripper (9) is provided in the head region with 
forwardly directed claw-shaped protrusions (10 and 11), which 

are preferably mutually opposite at about the same height, for 
retention at the retaining rods (12, 13), wherein the two 

retaining rods (13) directly opposite one another determine the 
width of the material intake gap (E) and at the same time take 

over the function of a finger guard. 
Document shredder according to claim 1, characterised thereby 
that the inner side (7e), which bears against the respective cutting 

roller core (3 or 4), of the stripper (7) bears in the stripping 
region (7d) directly by a nose (7e') and subsequently lies free by an  

 
annular gap (a) which is set back by a small dimension and extends up 

to the end. 
Document shredder according to claim 2, characterised thereby 
that the size of the annular gap (a) is so selected that the stripper 

(7) in the case of possible bending through of the cutting rollers 

and/or of the retaining rods (6) does not rub by its inner region 
(7e) on the roller core (3 or 4). 
Document shredder according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised thereby that each stripper (7) comprises a stripper 

half shell (7c), followed by a stripper centre rest (7a) and a 
stripper claw (7b), which altogether are arranged in L-shape, wherein 

the stripper claw (7b) is preferably mounted to be directed upwardly. 
Document shredder according to claim 4, characterised thereby 
that the length (L1) between the inner side (7e) of the stripper (7) 

and the middle of the stripper centre rest (7a) is preferably smaller 
than or the same as the length (L2) between the centre of the 

stripper centre rest (7a) and the stripper claw (7b). 
Document shredder according to one of claims 4 and 5, 
characterised thereby that the stripper backs (7f) lie at an obtuse 

angle relative to the respective cutting roller core (3 or 4). 
Document shredder according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that the spherical stripper regions 

(7a), which bear in the direction of the cutting mechanism centre (M) 
against the respective cutting roller core (3 or 4), are constructed 

to extend curvilinearly outwardly from their tips in such a manner 
that at every place of said spherical section the cut particles 

adhering to the cutting discs (1 or 2) impinge at one and the same 
angle, wherein this curvilinear region extends at least up to the 

outer diameter of the cutting disc (1 or 2). 
Document shredder according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that the guide plate, which projects  

 
into the material intake gap E, of the cutting mechanism cover 'A' 

adjoins a respective one of the retaining rods (13) with formation of 
a small gap, wherein the retaining rods (13) protrude forwardly 

somewhat relative to the material intake gap E. 
Document shredder according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that the retaining rods (5 and 6) 

fixing the stripper (7) by way of the centre rests (7a) and the claws 
(7b) at the rear side thereof in the cutting mechanism lie on a 

common line of action (W) opposing or compensating for the force flow 
direction from the stripper pressure. 
Document shredder according to one of more of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that the tips of the stripper regions 

(7d) bear against the respective cutting mechanism cores (3 or 4) 
spaced at different widths (x
1
 or x
2
) from the cutting mechanism 
centre (M). 
Document shredder according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that the auxiliary strippers (9) are 

likewise curvilinearly formed at their stripper region (9a) in such a 
manner that at every place of the spherical section the cut particles 

adhering to the cutting discs (1 or 2) impinge at one and the same 
angle. 
Document shredder according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised thereby that due to the shape and the position 

of the strippers (7) inclusive of the retaining rods (5 and 6), which 
retain these (7), relative to the cutting mechanism (3, 4) and the 

housing walls the free spaces (8) lying at both sides above and 
laterally of the cutting mechanism (3, 4) are sufficiently screened 

relative to the cut stock collecting space, which is disposed below 
the cutting mechanism (3, 4), in such a manner that, of the cut-up 

cut stock getting into the free spaces (8) during reversing, only 
detached smaller particles can fall into the cut stock collecting 

space.
