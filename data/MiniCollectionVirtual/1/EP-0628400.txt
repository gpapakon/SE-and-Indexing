<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device (3) for mechanical connection between two elements. The device includes resin-coated fibres (4) wound around a principal axis and has a loop around at least one axis hole close to a direction orthogonal to the principal axis. The invention also relates to a method for manufacture of a mechanical component by filament winding around a mandrel (2) rotationally driven about an axis, some of the windings having as axis the axis of rotation and other windings having a winding axis different from the axis of rotation.

A mechanical linking device (31, 40) designed to 
connect two elements to one another, the said device 

having a main axis (zz', 44) and two means to provide a 
connection with each of the said elements comprising 

resin-coated reinforcing fibres, a first connecting means 
(35, 36; 42) having at least one bore (33, 34) designed 

to receive a rod (43) whose axis is essentially 
orthogonal to the said main axis and formed by loops of 

fibres, characterised in that the said device has 
circumferential windings combined with longitudinal 

windings so that it can be adjusted essentially to 
withstand tractional stress between the two elements, the 

second connecting means has a conical bore (32; 41) 

coaxial with the said main axis, the narrow neck of which 
is arranged at a greater distance from the said first 

connecting means relative to the base of the cone, the 
said conical bore is basically formed by the 

circumferential winding (12) around the main axis and the 
said first means is formed by loop windings around the 

said bore, the strands (13, 14; 13a, 14a) of which form 
the longitudinal windings. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the said loop windings around the bore consist of a 

predetermined number of loops whose strands surrounding 
the bore are essentially parallel with one another (13, 

14) and of loops whose strands cross one another (13a, 
14a). 
A device as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the said first connecting 

means is shaped as a fork, the two flanges (35, 36) of 
which have the said loop windings of reinforcing wires. 
A device as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it has inserts coated with 

the resin-impregnated wires.  
 
A method of manufacturing a device as claimed in 
one of the preceding claims, comprising the following 

steps: 

a spindle (3; 20) is rotated about an axis zz', 
a means (5) for guiding at least one fibre (4) is 
displaced in two directions xx' and yy', 
 
   in which the spindle has a male, conical part (21) 

with an axis zz' and at least one rod (11; 25) whose axis 
is essentially orthogonal to the axis zz', the 

displacements of the spindle and guiding means are 
controlled so as to form fibre windings in 

circumferential turns (12) about the axis zz' over the 
conical portion of the spindle and in longitudinal loops 

around the said rod. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the guiding means is displaced in a direction 

parallel with zz', the other direction of displacement 
being perpendicular thereto. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the spindle has several rods whose 

axes are essentially orthogonal to the axis zz'. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that the fibre is impregnated with 

resin. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 5 to 8, 
characterised in that the resin is polymerised on the 

spindle. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 5 to 9, 
characterised in that the spindle wound with the 

impregnated fibres is enclosed in shells to give the said 
work-piece a regular external contour. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that a digitally controlled machine programme controls 

and synchronises the said displacements of the guiding 
means and spindle and the mechanical resistance of the  

 
finished parts is pre-determined by certain parameters of 

the said programme.
