<ABSTRACT>
A porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) material which is improved in bondability and is free from the problem of the 
buckling resistance on bending and tearing in the axial direction of tubes. This material is composed of a fibril part mainly comprising 

PTFE and a node part comprising a heat-meltable resin with a melting point lower than that of PTFE. The fibril part 
scarcely comprises the meltable resin. The production process comprises subjecting powdery paste extrusion material comprising 

particles of tetrafluoroethylene emulsion polymer and the above meltable resin to paste extrusion molding, optionally followed by 
rolling, to give an unsintered material, stretching the same at a temperature lower than the melting point of the meltable resin, 

and heat setting the stretched material at a temperature above the melting point of PTFE.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
polytetrafluoroethylene (which is, hereinafter, also referred to
as "PTFE") porous material having improved properties,
especially buckling resistance on bending and adhesion, a
process for the production of such a material, and the use thereof.A PTFE porous material has been used as for a
member of medical treatments, especially for tubes of the
medical treatments such as an artificial blood vessel since it
has inherent properties such as excellent chemical resistance
and heat resistance, its friction factor is small and further it is
porous.However, the tube made of the PTFE material has
problems of buckling (collapse) on bending and also tearing along
its longitudinal axial direction. In order to solve such problems,
Japanese Patent Kokai Publication Nos. 49-22792, 50-102673
and 55-90347 disclose tape or fiber wrapping around the PTFE
porous tube.Alternatively, in order to overcome the above 
problems with respect to the PTFE porous tube, Japanese Patent
Kokai Publication No. 55-52754 discloses application of a porous
elastomer coating around the tube.Since any solution as described above should further
treat the PTFE tube, namely, it requires a further processing, it
is not an economically advantageous solution. In addition, since
such a solution does not change the properties of the PTFE tube
itself, it highly depends on properties of the tape and the fiber,
so that it is not always preferred.Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 61-143124
discloses a method in which PTFE tubes which have been heat set
are connected together by providing a separate heat fusible resin
layer between them. When the PTFE tubes are connected by such
a method, there occurs a problem that porosity of a portion
where the connection is formed is not available.The PTFE material is used as an insulation of an
electric cable since it has an excellent electric insulating
property in addition to the properties as described above. When
the PTFE porous material is used as the cable insulation
material, especially in the production of a flat cable, an
adhesive is used so as to bond together the PTFE porous
materials or an unsintered PTFE porous materials are heated to a
temperature above their melting points so as to fuse the PTFE
materials. However, the method using the adhesive is not
satisfactory in the electrical properties and the heat resistance. Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 56-149712
discloses a process for the production of a flat cable in which a
plurality of conductors are
