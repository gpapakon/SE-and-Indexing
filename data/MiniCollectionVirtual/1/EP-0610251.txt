<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to paints 
and paint bases, and, more specifically to a process 
for providing a stable, gel-free dispersion of zinc 
pyrithione plus cuprous oxide biocide in paint. Combinations of zinc pyrithione and cuprous oxide 
are known to be excellent antifouling agents when 
formulated into paints and paint bases (i.e., the 
paint before pigment addition) also containing rosin, 
as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 
5,057,153. Unfortunately, however, such paints have 
now been found to thicken or gel unacceptably within a 
few days, at best, or a few hours, at worst, when 
formulated with typical commercial grades of zinc 
pyrithione in combination with cuprous oxide. Heretofore, the only solutions to the problem of 
gellation of paints containing rosin and zinc 
pyrithione in combination with cuprous oxide, known to 
the present inventors, have been to use rigorously 
purified zinc pyrithione, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 
5,098,473, or to add amines or esterified rosin, as 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,112,397. Since these 
solutions may have drawbacks such as increased cost or 
lack of compatibility with some paints, a new, 
economical solution to the problem would be highly 
desired by the paint manufacturing community in order 
to maximize flexibility in using this combination of 
biocides in view of its excellent biocidal activity.  
 In one aspect, the present invention relates to a 
process for providing a gellation-inhibited 
solvent-based paint or paint base containing zinc 
pyrithione and cuprous oxide which comprises the steps 
of: 
(a) incorporating said zinc pyrithione and also 
incorporating cuprous oxide into a solvent-based paint 
or paint base to provide a biocide-containing paint or 
paint base, said zinc pyrithione being present in an 
amount of between 1% and 25% (preferably 
5-25%, more preferably 10- 25%), and said cuprous 
oxide being present in an amount of between 20% 
and 70%, the total amount of said pyrithione 
salt plus said cuprous oxide being between 20% 
and 80%, said weight percents being used based upon 
the total weight of the biocide-containing paint or 
paint base, and (b) incorporating a metal salt of rosin or a 
mixture of metal salt of rosin plus underivatized 
rosin into said biocide-containing paint or paint 
base, said metal salt being the reaction product of a 
carboxylic acid-containing rosin (also referred to 
herein as "underivatized" rosin) with a 
metal-containing base (preferably a metal oxide or 
metal hydroxide),
