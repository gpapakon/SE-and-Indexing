<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating a modular, recombinant lead-acid 
battery is provided for. The method includes 

providing a plurality of thermoplastic frames, including 
at least two frames which support electrochemically 

active plates. The frames are adapted to be stacked and 
welded together such that the plates are spaced apart 

from each other a predetermined distance. One or more 
separators also are provided. The separators have an 

uncompressed state in which their thickness is equal to 
or greater than the predetermined distance between plates 

and a compressed state. The frames and separators are 
stacked such that a separator is disposed between 

adjacent plates in its compressed state. The frames then 
are successively vibration welded together, again while 

the separator is in its compressed state. The separator 
has a predetermined thickness in its compressed state 

effective to reduce damage to the separator caused by 
abrasion of the separators by the plates during vibration 

welding. The separator also tends to assume its 
uncompressed state in the presence of electrolyte so that 

the separator contacts the plates upon completion of the 
battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for assembling 
lead-acid electric storage batteries, and especially, to 
methods for fabricating modular lead-acid storage 
batteries using vibrational welding to join the 
thermoplastic frames incorporated therein. Modular multi-cell batteries represent a total 
departure from traditional designs for SLI automotive 
lead-acid batteries. Traditional designs incorporate a 
premolded container divided into individual cell 
compartments. Battery plates and separators are 
separately formed and assembled and then are inserted 
into the cell compartments during assembly of the 
battery. Modular battery designs, such as those disclosed in 
U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 762,814, filed September 
17, 1991 (to be issued on October 26, 1993 as U.S. Pat. 
5,256,502), U.S. Pat. 5,068,160 to T. Clough et al., U.S. 
Pats. 4,239,839 and 4,209,579 to W. McDowell and U.S. 
Pats. 4,022,951 and 3,941,615 to W. McDowell, however, do 
not have a premolded container. Instead, the container, 
such as it is, is formed by joining together a collection 
of thermoplastic frames. More specifically, modular lead-acid batteries are 
fabricated from a plurality of relatively thin, generally 
rectangular, prefabricated thermoplastic frames. Some 
frames support electrochemically active battery plates 
and, in some designs, other frames support separator 
material. During assembly of the battery, the frames are 
stacked and joined together to create an assembly of 
alternating plate frames and separator frames sandwiched 
between two end frames. In their joined state, the 
collection of frames constitutes an electrolyte-tight 
container.  In some designs, the frames include a number of 
partition ribs which extend across the peripheral members 
of the frames. When a battery is assembled from the 
frames, the peripheral members of the frames are joined 
together to form the battery container. The partition 
ribs are joined together to form dividers which define a 
plurality of cells between adjacent plate-supporting 
frames. It is possible to join an entire stack of frames 
together at the same time in a single induction or 
conduction heat-sealing operation. Such methods, 
however, require that the frames incorporate a metallic 
conductor or inductor near the sealing area of the frame, 
a feature which makes the frame much more expensive. As 
a practical matter, therefore, modular frames having 
partition ribs and the like which will form cell dividers 
in a finished battery must be joined together
