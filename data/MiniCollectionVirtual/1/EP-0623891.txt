<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held computer with an input pen capable of 
handwriting recognition. Characters are inputted by a 

user's manual operation with the input pen on a 
transparent coordinate input plate in front of a display 

screen. The computer discriminates pen-input 
charact
eristic of the user, and selects a character-recognition 
dictionary based on the discrimination 

result.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to an electronic
apparatus and a control method for the apparatus and,
more particularly, to an information processing
apparatus having an input device such as an input pen
and a control method for the apparatus.Conventionally, various apparatuses, such as a
personal computer and a word processor have been
proposed as information processing apparatuses of this
type. These apparatuses display character data of
document and that of a program, and perform editing,
search and other processings.Further, various coordinate input devices
comprising an input pen and an input tablet are used for
inputting handwritten characters and figures into the
information processor. One of these input devices is
used with an apparatus which performs character
recognition based on an input character pattern using a
pattern matching method, as well as an apparatus which
stores an input locus and outputs the stored locus.The pattern matching apparatus has a pattern-matching
dictionary for comparison with an input
character pattern so as to have a high character 
recognition rate in recognition of various handwritten
characters to be inputted.However, the pattern-matching dictionary is not
complete, therefore it often makes erroneous
recognition. For this reason, the apparatus requires a
user to write legibly.One solution to this inconvenience is preparing a
plurality of pattern-matching dictionaries for various
handwritings and switching the dictionaries based upon
the user's handwriting feature.However, this requires that the pattern-matching
dictionaries are switched every time when another user
having a different handwriting feature makes character-input.
Further, the user has to know what dictionary is
currently being used. This also puts the user to
inconvenience.Recently, pen-input computer has attracted public
attention. One of the improvements in operability of
this apparatus is changing its display direction in
accordance with a direction from which a user accesses
the apparatus. This allows the user, who is not
necessarily in a position facing the front of the
apparatus, to see a displayed image in a proper
direction to the user.One possible means for switching the display
directions is a logical or physical switch to designate 
a direction as the top of an image to be displayed.
However, this requires the user to manipulate the switch
whenever an input direction (i.e., a direction in which
a user is located, and from which the user makes input)
changes.In addition, in a case where this type

<CLAIMS>
An electronic apparatus which performs handwriting
recognition by using character recognition means

comprising:

discrimination means (
9, 10; 22, 23
) for
discriminating between different users;
selection means (
1; S105-S108
) for selecting one of
dictionaries (
40, 41
) for character recognition, based on a
discrimination result from said discrimination means (
9,
10; 22, 23
); and
character recognition control means (
1; S110
) for
controlling said character recognition means to refer to

the dictionary (
40, 41
) selected by said selection means
(
1
; 
S105-S108
);

   
characterized in that

   said discrimination means (
9, 10; 22, 23
) comprises
detection means (
22, 23
) for detecting a position at which
a palm of the user is rested; and

   said discrimination means (
9, 10; 22, 23
) determines
whether a user who performs handwriting input is

right-handed or left-handed on the basis of the position of
the palm detected by said detection means (
22, 23
), and
wherein, if said discrimination means (
9, 10; 22, 23
)
discriminates that the user is right-handed, said selection

means selects a character recognition dictionary (
40
) for
right-handed input, while if said discrimination means

discriminates that the user is left-handed, said selection
means selects a character recognition dictionary (
41
) for
left-handed input. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the apparatus is a hand-held computer with an input
pen.
A method for performing handwriting recognition by
using character recognition means comprising the steps of:


discriminating between different users;
selecting one of dictionaries (
40, 41
) for character
recognition, based on a discrimination result from said

discrimination step; and
controlling said character recognition to refer to the
dictionary (
40, 41
) selected in said selection step;

   
characterized by
 the steps of:

detecting a position at which a palm of the user is
rested; and
determining whether a user who performs handwriting
input is right-handed or left-handed on the basis of the

position of the palm detected in said detection step, and
wherein, if it is discriminated in said discrimination step

that the user is right-handed, selecting in said selection
step a character recognition dictionary (
40
) for
right-handed input, while if it is discriminated in said

discrimination step that the user is left-handed, selecting
in said selection step a character recognition dictionary

(
41
) for left-handed input.
A method according to claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 the method is applicable to a hand-held computer with
an input pen.
A computer program product for a computer,
comprising software code portions for performing the steps

of claim 3 when said product is run on the computer. 
A computer program product according to claim 5,
wherein said computer program product comprises a computer-readable

medium on which said software code portions are
stored.
A computer program product according to claim 5,
wherein said computer program product is directly loadable

into the internal memory of the computer.
