Printing ink, characterized in that it comprises at
least one dyestuff which, in the form of the free

acid, corresponds to the formula


wherein

V and W
independently of one another represent CH
3

or C
2
H
5
,

or
V and W,
together with the C atom to which they
are bonded, represent a saturated

carbocyclic 5- or 6-membered ring,
X and X
1
independently of one another represent
SO
3
H or COOH, 
Y and Y
1
independently of one another represent NH
2

or OH and
Z and Z
1
independently of one another represent CH
3

or COOH,

and wherein the substituents X and X
1
 independently
of one another are each in the ortho-, meta- or

para-position relative to the nitrogen atom via
which the phenyl ring is bonded, and the -SO
2
O
groups are each independently of one another in the

ortho-, meta- or para-position relative to the azo
groups.
Printing ink according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises at least one dyestuff which, in

the form of the free acid, corresponds to the
formula (I)

wherein

V and W
represent CH
3
,
X and X
1
are identical and are both either SO
3
H or
COOH,
Y and Y
1
are identical and are both either NH
2
 or
OH and
Z and Z
1
are identical and are both either CH
3
 or
COOH.
Printing ink according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that it comprises a dyestuff which, in

the form of the free acid, corresponds to the
formula 


Printing ink according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that it comprises 0.1 to 20% by weight of

dyestuff.
Printing ink according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that it has a pH of between 5 and 12.

in that it comprises 2 to 30% by weight of

organic water-soluble solvent.
Printing ink according to Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the dyestuff of the formula

(I) has been purified, desalinated and if
appropriate concentrated beforehand by using a

membrane process.
Printing ink comprising a dyestuff according to
Claim 1 and Direct Yellow 86 or Acid Yellow 23.
Printing ink comprising a dyestuff according to
Claim 3 and Direct Yellow 86 or Acid Yellow 23.
Process for the preparation of a printing ink 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that at least

one dyestuff of the formula (I), which has been
purified, desalinated and if appropriate concentrated

beforehand, if appropriate, by using a membrane
process, is dissolved in water and/or one or more

organic solvents.
Process for printing carrier materials with a
recording liquid using an ink jet recording system,

characterized in that the recording liquid is a
printing ink according to Claims 1 to 7.
Process according to Claim 11, characterized in that
the carrier material is paper, wood, textiles,

plastic or metal.
