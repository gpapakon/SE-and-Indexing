<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the resolution of racemic 
mixtures of threo-alkyl-2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2-X-phenylthio) 
propionates. Optically pure (2S,3S)-threo-alkyl-2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2-X-phenylthio)propionates 
are valuable intermediates 
in the synthesis of diltiazem [3; absolute configuration 
(2S,3S)] which is one of the most promising calcium channel 
inhibitors in clinical use. 
The DE-A 33 37 176 and the US-A 4.908.469 describe the separation 
of (±)-2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2-aminophenylthio)propionic 
acid and propionates. Senuma et al. (Chem. 
Pharm. Bull. 37, 3204-3208; 1989) describe the separation of 
the corresponding enantiomers of (2-nitrophenylthio)propionic 
acid based on the formation of the diastereomeric salts with 
optically active aminoacids (L-lysine) or tartaric acid. The 
chemical resolution similar to the formation of diastereomers 
requires the availability of an optically pure compound, such 
as L-lysine, dismounting of the diastereomer and isolation of 
the liberated L-lysine, for example, and recycling it from one 
solution to another. So far the only biocatalytical method for the preparation of  
 
(2S,3S)-threo-alkyl-2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2-X-phenylthio)propionates 
describes the hydrolysis of racemic 
threo-methyl-2-acyloxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2-nitrophenyl-thio)propionate 
catalyzed by lipase (Chem. Pharm. Bull. 37, 
2876-2878; 1989). The enzymatic hydrolysis proceeds slowly 
because the starting material and the products dissolve poorly 
in water. This is why the reactions have to be performed in an 
organic solvent which is saturated with water. Additionally, 
the reaction is kinetically controlled. Thus, the yield of the 
optically active product remains low, if its highest possible 
optical purity is to be reached. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to 
provide a simple and highly enantiospecific enzymatic method 
for the resolution of racemic threo-alkyl-2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2-X-phenylthio)propionates 
in order to 
obtain the optical isomers with high purity. The present invention therefore concerns a method for the 
resolution of racemic mixtures of threo-alkyl-2-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2-X-phenylthio)propionates 
of formula 1 
wherein R₁ is an alkyl group and X is NO₂, NH₂ or an NH-R₂ 
group with R₂ representing an acyl group or an alkoxy carbonyl 
group, each optionally substituted with one or more halogen 
atoms, comprising subjecting said racemic mixtures to reaction
