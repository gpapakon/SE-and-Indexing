<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for dissolving zinc comprises a reception vessel (1) for the zinc particles to be dissolved and inflow and outflow devices by which fresh electrolytes are introduced into the vessel and are then discharged therefrom enriched with zinc, and also comprises collection and removal devices for the gases formed in the zinc dissolution. The reception vessel (1), in its lower region (1a) has an intermediate sieve plate (2, 3) to support the zinc particle charge and, beneath this intermediate sieve plate (2, 3), the inflow device (4, 5) for the fresh electrolyte. In its upper region there is provided an overflow (16) for the zinc-enriched electrolyte. A filter (15) and collection vessel (13) are arranged downstream of this overflow (16). Above the reception vessel (1) is arranged a gas collection space (17) having a take-off device (18).

Device for dissolving zinc by means of liquid electrolytes containing acid, with a
receiving container for the zinc particles to be dissolved and inflow and outflow devices for

continuous bringing in and taking out of fresh or zinc-enriched electrolytes as well as
catching and discharge devices for the gases, such as hydrogen, arising during the zinc

dissolution, characterised thereby that the receiving container (1) in the form of an
upwardly open pot has in its lower region (1a) a sieve intermediate base (2, 3) for support

of the zinc particle filling and below the sieve intermediate base (2, 3) the inflow device (4,
5) for the fresh electrolytes and at the upper opening rim an overflow (16) for the zinc-enriched

electrolytes and outside and below this overflow a filter container (15) and
catching container (13) surrounding the pot, as well as a gas collecting chamber (17),

which is arranged above those containers and the pot opening, with take-off equipment.
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the filters consist of
baskets (15, 29) with fillings of glass balls and/or plastics material balls.
Device according to claim 2 with a cylindrical receiving container, characterised
thereby that the catching container (13) and the baskets (15, 29) are arranged in segment

or ring shape around the outer circumference of the receiving container (1).
Device according to claims 2 and 3, characterised thereby that basket-shaped
annular chambers (29) with sieve bases (29a) are arranged on a carousel carrier (30) to

be rotationally driven and are fed in succession to an emptying station and then a filling
station for the ball filling.
Device according to one or more of claims 2 to 4, characterised by a cleaning
rinsing device, which is arranged between the emptying station and filling station, for the

ball filling.
Device according to claim 5, characterised by a rinsing device (32, 33, 34) acting
on the ball filling in the annular chambers (29) in a cleaning position.
Device according to claim 6, characterised by an overflow weir (32) arranged in the
region of the cleaning rinsing device at the overflow (16). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised by a nitrogen feed duct (38) associated
with the cleaning rinsing device (32, 33, 34).
Device according to claim 1, characterised by a measuring probe (27) which is
arranged in the gas collecting chamber (17), measures the concentration of the collected

gas and influences the feed of the fresh electrolytes by way of setting devices (4, 5).
Device according to claim 1, characterised by a nitrogen feed duct (25) inserted
into the gas collecting chamber.
Device according to claim 9, characterised by a fresh air feed entry, which is
associated with the gas collecting chamber (17), with a pendulating flap opening inwardly.
Device according to claim 1, characterised by a charging device (19, 20, 28), which
is arranged above the receiving container (1) at the gas collecting chamber (17), for a

movable filling container (21), which is placeable on the charging device, for zinc particle
fillings to be fed to the receiving container (1).
Device according to claim 1, characterised by a blast nozzle set (6), which is
arranged below the sieve intermediate base (2, 3) in the receiving container (1), for the

blowing-in of nitrogen.
Device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the receiving container (1)
is placed on pressure measuring cells, which influence checking and comparison devices

which monitor the size of the filing (F) of the receiving container (1).
