<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a tape-shaped superconducting 
wire is provided. The wire maintains a high critical 

temperature and a high critical current density along the 
overall length thereof. In this method, raw material 

powder for the oxide superconductor is first charged in a 
silver sheath and the sheath charged with the powder is 

subjected to plastic working to prepare a first flat type 
wire. On the other hand, a second wire consisting of a 

tape wire formed by coating a surface of a flat type wire 
having at least an outer surface consisting essentially of 

silver or a silver alloy with a metal oxide or ceramics, 
or a tape wire containing ceramics fibers
 and a binder 
dissipated by heat treatment is prepared. The first and 

second wires (1, 2) are layered with each other, and 
tightly wound in a pancake coil shape. The wires (1, 2) 

wound in the pancake coil shape are heat treated for 
sintering the oxide superconductor. After the heat 

treatment, the first wire (1) is separated from the second 
wire (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
preparing a high-temperature superconducting wire, and
more particularly, it relates to a method of preparing an
oxide superconducting wire, which is applied to a high-temperature
superconducting coil or the like, having a
high critical current density at the liquid nitrogen
temperature.With discovery of yttrium, bismuth and thallium oxide
superconducting materials respectively exhibiting critical
temperatures (Tc) of 90 K, 108 K and 125 K, which are
higher than the liquid nitrogen temperature (77.3 K),
application of oxide superconducting materials to the
fields of energy and electronics are now being expected.
In particular, preparation of a wire from an oxide high-temperature
superconductor has been positively developed
since the discovery of such a material, for the purpose of
application to the field of energy. Among various methods
which have been studied in relation to such preparation of
superconducting wires, there is a method of covering an 
oxide superconductor with a stabilizing metal for
preparing a wire. According to this method, a silver
sheath which is charged with an oxide superconductor is
subjected to plastic working such as wire drawing and
rolling, and thereafter sintered to provide a wire. In
this process, high orientation is supplied to the
superconductor which is covered with silver by the
combination of plastic working and sintering, thereby
implementing a high critical current. When a high-temperature
superconducting wire is applied to a coil for
a magnet, it is possible to take a process of heat
treating a long wire which is obtained by charging a
silver sheath with an oxide superconductor and performing
plastic working, further performing plastic working, and
coiling the same to heat treat the coil again. It has
been desired that the superconducting coil obtained
through such a process maintains a high critical current
density along its overall length, in addition to a high
critical temperature.In the aforementioned process, a tape wire which is
obtained after the first plastic working is generally
coiled and heat treated. In such heat treatment of the
wire, it is necessary to prevent adjacent turns of the
coiled wire from adhesion to each other, and from
diffusion of components therebetween. Japanese Patent 
Laying-Open No. 4-274115 (1992) discloses a method of heat
treating a superconducting wire of a high transition
temperature (high Tc) having a silver protective clad
layer, by bonding a layer consisting of ceramics onto the
sil
