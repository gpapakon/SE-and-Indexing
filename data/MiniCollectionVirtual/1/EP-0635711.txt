<ABSTRACT>
Known techniques for the filtration of 
biological liquids, such as centrifugation, are 

expensive as they require specialised apparatus to 
carry them out. Described herein is a simple 

apparatus and method which filters a biological 
liquid, such as whole blood, and then allows the 

filtered liquid to be applied to a diagnostic test 
element. The apparatus comprises a container (2) 

having contained filters (10, 12) and into which a 
quantity of biological liquid is added for separation 

and retention of a quantity of the sample. The 
container (2) has an exterior surface (14) wettable 

with the filtered sample to collect the same, and a 
cover (16) for preventing significant evaporation of 

the wetted filter surface (14), the cover (16, 18, 20, 
22, 24) including a movable transfer element for 

transferring filtered and collected liquid from the 
wetted surface (14) and delivering the liquid to a 

test element by contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filtration and
dispensing device and method of using such a device in
the field of clinical diagnostic analyzers and is more
particularly concerned with the filtering and
transferring of a patient sample on to a test element.In the field of testing of liquid analytes,
particularly those using the so-called dried chemistry
technology, a quantity of patient liquid is dispensed
on to a test slide element having at least one dried
reagent layer with which the liquid interacts to
produce a detectable signal for sensing the analyte of
interest.It has been required with clinical
diagnostic analyzers, such as those manufactured by
Eastman Kodak Company under the trademark
"EKTACHEMâ„¢", which use the dried chemistry assay
approach, that serum be separated from the whole blood
sample prior to testing of the sample. Techniques for
performing the separation are known and typically
require centrifugation of a liquid sample to separate
the heavier phase, (for example, that portion carrying
the red blood cells), from the lighter phase, (for
example, serum). These separation techniques are
expensive in that they require a centrifuge, or other
apparatus, to perform the separation. In addition,
these techniques are time consuming in that they are
usually performed off-line and separate from the
analyzer prior to testing of the filtered sample.Alternatively, there are known filtering
techniques in which a quantity of patient liquid is
added to one end of a filter and separated. The
filtered liquid then directly passes into a container
for holding the filtered liquid from whence the liquid
can be aspirated into a conventional pipette tip for 
metering on to a test element. Alternatively, the
separated liquid may be retained at one end of the
filter after being passed therethrough.There are associated problems with each
described technique. In the first described method,
additional processing steps are required to first
collect the filtered liquid and subsequently to
aspirate it into a tip for dispensing. In addition,
using multiple pipette tips and containers increases
the number of disposables.There are also a number of potential
problems associated with the metering of a sample,
filtered or otherwise, using conventional point source
deposition methods.In the most common point source method, the
pipette tip approach, a predetermined quantity of
liquid is dispensed from the orifice of a pipette tip
suspended a short distance above the test element.
The point source delivers the liquid in the form
