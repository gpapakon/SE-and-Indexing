<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drive without play for a table which rotates on a machine tool, which is characterised in that at least two parallel shafts with two spur gears each are connected between the pinion of the drive motor and the drive gear arranged on the table spindle. Of the spur gears, in each case one gear engages in the motor pinion and one gear engages with a helix angle differing from this in the table drive gear, the corresponding gears of both intermediate shafts having the same tooth number, and at least one intermediate shaft being mounted so as to be axially displaceable in such a way that the tooth systems of the intermediate shafts come to bear in different directions.
