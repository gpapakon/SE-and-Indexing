<ABSTRACT>
A high-silica zeolite is used as an adsorbent (1) for 
unburned hydrocarbons in automobile exhaust gas, 

especially at cold start. The adsorbent (1) may carry a 
catalyst and be carried on an electrical heater (2), for 

desorption and reaction of the adsorbed hydrocarbons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adsorbent for purification of automobile exhaust gas comprising a zeolite, an
adsorbent structure comprising a honeycomb structure and the adsorbent thereon, to a method of controlling emission
of unburnt hydrocarbons from an internal combustion engine and to apparatus for purifying automobile exhaust gas.Catalytic converters used for purification of automobile exhaust gas or the like must be heated to a certain temperature
or higher in order to exhibit their catalytic activities. Accordingly, when they are not sufficiently heated as in
the start-up of automobile, it is necessary to heat them.As the technique for heating a catalytic converter, there is known, for example, a technique proposed in Japanese
Utility Model Application Laid-Open No. 67609/1988. This document discloses a catalytic converter comprising (a) a
ceramic monolith catalyst and (b) an electrically heatable metal monolith catalyst provided upstream of the ceramic
monolith catalyst (a) in close vicinity thereto, consisting of a metal carrier and alumina coated thereon.Of the harmful compounds (HC's, CO and NOx) present in automobile exhaust gases, particularly HC's (hydrocarbons)
produce photochemical smog (oxidant); accordingly, regulation therefor has been tightened, and proposals
have been made to purify the HC's discharged in a large amount at the engine start-up, by the utilization of the adsorbability
of zeolite. For example, there has been proposed apparatuses for purification of automobile exhaust gas,
arranged in the exhaust gas system of automobile, which comprise (a) a purification catalyst and (b) an adsorbent (e.
g. zeolite) or a catalyst-supporting adsorbent provided upstream of the purification catalyst (a) [reference is made to,
for example, Japanese patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 75327/1990, 173312/1990 and 135126/1990].Further, an adsorbent comprising a metal carrier and zeolite coated thereon is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open No. 126937/1990.The above proposals, however, each have a problem. The catalytic converter disclosed in Japanese Utility Model
Application Laid-Open No. 67609/1988 consists of a metal monolith catalyst as a preheater and a main monolith catalyst;
with this catalytic converter, it is difficult to purify hydrocarbons in exhaust gas, at the start-up of engine.With the apparatus for purification of automobile exhaust gas arranged in the exhaust gas system of automobile
(disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 75327/1990),
