<DESCRIPTION>
 COMBUSTION ENHANCEMENT SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention;The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for increasing the efficiency of hydrocarbon combustion processes to thereby reduce the production of undesirable emissions. More particularly, the invention provides an apparatus and method for conveying, at a precisely controllable rate, minute quantities of a combustion enhancing substance directly to the site of combustion.Description of the Prior Art:A wide variety of methods and devices have been disclosed that are intended to enhance the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels by introducing various substances into the combustion process.The intent is to improve efficiency, i.e. to increase the amount of the fuel's inherent chemical energy that is converted into thermal energy, and simultaneously to decrease undesirable emissions including unburned or incompletely burned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. Bringing about a more complete oxidation of the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide has the simultaneous effect of increasing efficiency and decreasing the undesirable emissions. 

 A wide variety of substances have been relied upon to perform a variety of functions in the interests of enhancing combustion processes. Coreactants, catalysts, as well as compounds subject to operating mechanisms not fully understood have been introduced into combustion processes via the fuel supply, the oxidant supply or into the fuel and oxidant commixture just prior to or during actual combustion.The viability of a particular system depends not only on the efficacy of the substance utilized, but also on how easily the substance can be handled as well as how easily the substance can accurately be delivered into the combustion process in a highly dispersed form at the proper levels. Substances have been identified that are effective at ppb-range concentrations but systems attempting to deliver such small concentrations in highly dispersed form have suffered from complexity and fail to maintain proper concentration levels. Maintaining the proper concentration level is important not only in terms of the economic considerations involved, but also because the presence in the combustion process of too little as well as too much active substance may diminish its combustion enhancing effect.Platinum is an example of a substance known to promote combustion reactions at concentrations as low as 30 ppb of fuel. The extremely low concentration requirement precludes simply
