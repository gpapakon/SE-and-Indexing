<DESCRIPTION>
 AXIAL BEARING FOR RECIPROCATING HERMETIC COMPRESSORSField of the InventionThe present invention refers to an axial bearing for reciprocating hermetic compressors with a vertical shaft, of the type used in small refrigerating systems. Background of the InventionReciprocating hermetic compressors usually consist of a motor, mounted inside a hermetically sealed shell. These compressors comprise a cylinder block, supporting a main bearing, inside which rotates a vertical crankshaft, which is provided with a pump rotor at its bottom. During the compressor operation, the rotation of the crankshaft carries, through the pump rotor, lubricant oil from a sump, provided at a lower portion of the compressor shell, up to the bearing and other components. This lubrication of a hydrodynamic nature has the function of forming an oil film between the parts presenting a mutual relative movement, thereby avoiding the contact and, consequently, the wear therebetween. Nevertheless, in components that do not present a geometry that is favorable to the formation of an oil film, there occurs a marginal lubrication, the components being thus subjected to a higher friction, causing mechanical losses for the compressor. This type of marginal lubrication occurs mainly between the axial bearing and the crankshaft. This axial bearing is mounted to the cylinder block assembly, between the upper portion of the main bearing, in order not to present a relative movement between the latter and the supporting base or peripheral flange of the crankshaft eccentric. Said axial bearing is in the form of a supporting cylindrical ring, with its opposite end faces being parallel to each other. The loads exerted on said axial bearing refer to the weight of the electric motor and crankshaft. 

Theoretically, parallel bearings do not generate a hydrodynamic support. Nevertheless, manufacture imperfections, thermal deformations or inclinations of the crankshaft during its rotation may give rise to an oil film between the annular surface of the axial bearing and the adjacent surface of the crankshaft, said oil film being insufficient to guarantee a good bearing performance. The small inclinations of the crankshaft result from the temporary load accumulations over the eccentric of said shaft during rotation. This effect is mainly noted during compression, when the forces on the shaft are much higher than the forces to which said shaft is subjected during suction. In order to obtain a convenient hydrodynamic force in parallel face axial bearings, it is
