<ABSTRACT>
Optical fiber and cable performance are assured by a category of UV-cured
polyurethane acrylates. Low cost is the consequence of use of the

polycarbonate oligomer. Good performance and long life are ascribed to other
ingredients of the coatings. Dependence on the hindered phenols for antioxidant

protection assures sufficient protection for these inherently stable materials without
incurring fiber damage found to result from use of hindered amine antioxidants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to optical fiber and to optical fiber cable as well as to other
apparatus incorporating optical fiber.Optical fiber continues to be the focus for development of high capacity
communications systems. State-of-the-art fiber has sufficiently low insertion loss,
chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion to satisfy requirements for
multichannel 10 Gbit capability - soon to be extended to 20 Gbit/s. The erbium amplifier
permits repeaterless transoceanic operation in systems being installed. This capability,
together with contemplated upgrading, lead to expected useful fiber life of decades. This
has, in turn, drawn attention to long-life fiber packaging.Manufacturing, installation, and in-use needs include protection both from physical
damage and from chemical attack. Optical fiber coatings must be applied early in
manufacture to preserve strength and to resist microbending. UV-curing of coating
applied as the fiber is drawn protects it from damage by take-up equipment. Differing
coating requirements at the coating-to-fiber interface and at the outer surface are
satisfied by dual coatings. The inner or primary coating must be soft enough to buffer
externally applied stresses - must have low modulus (generally specified at 340 kPa (50
psi) to 3400 kPa (500 psi) at room temperature) corresponding with low glass transition
temperatures (generally specified at -20°C to -80°C) to assure continuance of this
property over the full range of anticipated operating conditions. The outer coating - the
"secondary" coating - must have physical and chemical toughness, and must distribute
externally applied stresses. This translates into specification requirements of high
modulus 140,000 kPa (20,000 psi) to 1.4 x 106 kPa (200,000 psi) at room temperature
and high glass transition temperatures (35°C - 125°C). Inherent or addition-dependent
properties often include solvent resistance and low surface friction.Glass transition temperature is the midpoint value of the temperature interval over
which the coating (primary or secondary) changes from a glassy solid to a rubbery solid.
Because of the viscoelastic character of polymers, the experimentally determined glass
transition temperature is dependent upon the time scale of the measurement used.
Glass transition temperature values may be determined by dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA) in which an approximately 125 µm thick film of the cured coating is subjected to a
small oscillatory mechanical 
deformation in tension at a frequency of 1
