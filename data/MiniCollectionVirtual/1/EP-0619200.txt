<ABSTRACT>
Since battery is convenient for mounting up, it is 
widely used for various kinds of appliances, such as electro 

vehicles, etc. But the kind of storage, or fuel, or thermal, 
or solar battery has physilcal basic voltage. Generally 

speaking, we shall choose its voltage and capacity by means 
of its multiple series and supply it in accordance with the 

need of load by means of stepped voltage, or control it by 
serial linear members, or operate it by chopped wave 

switches. This is an efficient circuit design mainly to 
provide a multi-output stepped compound voltage, and further 

to combine with a field intensity control to enable DC motor 
control circuit to provide continuous linear control among 

stepped voltages in relation to voltage output or the output 
by slow increase in speed or slow feedback reduction and 

further to control the motor by means of series with limited 
current of solid switch members or constant current output.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stepped compound voltage power 
supply and field control arrangement. Since batteries are convenient to install, they are widely 
used for a variety of appliances, such as electric vehicles 
etc. However, most batteries, whether powered by fuel or 
thermal energy, or solar energy, are physically limited to 
a single basic voltage. Generally speaking, one can make 
a battery's voltage and capacity selectable only by 
employing multiple, series-connected batteries, and 
supplying the output in accordance with the needs of the 
load by means of a stepped voltage, by controlling the 
output using serial linear members, or by operating the 
power supply using switches. G3-A-1 590 375 describes a known multi-cell battery system, 
and EP-A-0 456 345 describes known apparatus for optimising 
control of a dc motor. The present invention provides a stepped compound voltage 
power supply and field control arrangement for a DC motor 
having at least one field winding and an armature, the 
arrangement comprising a controller and a stepped compound 
voltage supply constituted by a plurality of DC power 
supply units arranged to be connected in series and/or 
parallel connections to provide a stepped output voltage, 
the controller including first and second independently-operable 
control means, wherein the first control means is 
provided to change the intensity of the field generated by 
the field winding, wherein the armature is connected to the 
stepped compound voltage power supply by means of a series-connected 
solid state switch for adjusting the output 
voltage, and wherein the second control means controls the  
 
solid state switch, thereby to control the motor speed more 
continuously than is provided solely by the variation in 
the supply of stepped voltage to the armature. This is an efficient circuit design which involves 
providing a multiple output stepped compound voltage, and 
which further includes a field intensity control for 
enabling a DC motor control circuit to provide continuous 
linear control among stepped voltages in relation to the 
voltage output by slowly increasing the speed of the motor 
or by slow feedback reduction, and further by controlling 
the motor by means or a series connection with limited 
current solid state switch members to provide constant 
current output. The invention will now be described in greater detail, by 
way of example, with reference to the drawings, in which:-
