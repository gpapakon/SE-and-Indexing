<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre 
with an improved belt structure capable of reducing 
the running noise. Recently, increase in running noise of the vehicles 
has become a social problem. Further, in a 
passenger car, especially in a high-grade car, 
quietness is required during running. Therefore, 
there is a great demand for a low noise tyre. The major source of noise from a tyre is the tread 
configuration or pattern. Therefore, in order to 
reduce such noise, a great effort to improve the 
tread pattern has been made, and good results have 
been obtained. However, as the noise from the tread pattern is 
decreased, the noise from other factors, i.e., then 
internal tyre structure is relatively increased. 
Accordingly, it is now necessary to reduce such 
noise. The inventors have discovered that 
vibrations of tyre sidewalls are the main cause of 
such noise. They found that the vibrations of the 
sidewalls are caused by the vibration of the breaker  
 
belt in the tread region, and thus, the vibration of 
the sidewalls can be reduced by reducing the 
vibration of the breaker belt. On the other hand, 
such a belt is important for the running performance 
factors of the tyre such as rolling resistance, 
cornering force and the like, and the running 
performances are liable to be decreased by changing 
the belt structure. EP-A-0280442 discloses a pneumatic tyre comprising a 
breaker belt and radially outer bandage layer 
separated by an intermediate rubber layer. The 
intermediate rubber layer is formed in a single 
piece and serves to reduce the rolling resistance of 
the tyre and improve the breaker durability. It is therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a pneumatic tyre in which the running 
noise is reduced by reducing the vibration of the 
tread reinforcing belt, without sacrificing the 
running performances of the tyre. According to one aspect of the present invention, a 
pneumatic tyre comprises a carcass extending between 
a pair of bead portions through a tread portion and 
sidewall portions, a breaker belt disposed radially  
 
outside the carcass in the tread portion, a bandage 
belt disposed radially outside the breaker belt, and 
a vibration damper layer disposed between the 
breaker belt and the bandage belt, the vibration 
damper layer having a thickness of from 0.02 to 0.3 
times the thickness of the tread portion measured 
from the tread surface at the tyre equatorial plane 
characterised in that the vibration damper layer is 
made of a plurality of
