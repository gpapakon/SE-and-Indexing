<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing
a material which is suitable for use as the top
sheet of an absorbent disposable article, such as a
sanitary napkin, an incontinence guard or a diaper, and
also to material manufactured in accordance with the
method.Absorbent disposable articles are often provided with a
top sheet on that side of the article which lies proximal
to the wearer in use. Consequently, the top sheet
shall be felt to be soft and dry by the wearer. In order
to provide a feeling of dryness to the wearer, perforated
hydrophobic plastic films are sometimes used closest
to the wearer's body. It is also known to provide in the
film holes of a conical or straight tubular configuration,
so as to obtain capillaries which reduce the risk
of re-wetting, i.e. to reduce the tendency of fluid that
has been absorbed in an underlying absorbent body
flowing back through the perforations in the plastic
film when the absorbent body is subjected to external
pressure forces. Another known method of alleviating
risk of re-wetting involves providing a spacing sheet
between the plastic sheet and the absorbent body and by
forming the top sheet from several different layers of
material.One example of a composite top sheet is comprised of a
perforated plastic film which has been laminated to a
layer of non-woven material by hot-calendaring, ultrasonic 
welding or gluing. Such top sheets have good
draining ability and relatively low re-wetting tendencies,
but are relatively stiff and often even rough.US-A-4 495 133 discloses a method and apparatus for making a pile-surfaced textile
structure. A laminate consisting of a textile web and a plastic film on one side thereof
is fed to a heating roll with the plastic film in contact therewith. After heating, by
moving with the heating roll for part of a revolution thereof, the laminate leaves the
roll and passes over an air injection tube with the textile layer side in contact
therewith. The air injection tube has apertures from which air jets are blown through
the textile layer of the laminate. When the air jets reach the plastic film, they cause
piles to form which extend from the outer surface of the film, away from the textile
layer. According to this disclosure, one example of the resulting laminate textile
structure has been found to be suitable for use in the facing material for diapers, and
soft to the touch, and since the materials were all composed of water repellant
materials, the textile structure has been found to show good spot

A method for manufacturing a material suitable for
use as the top sheet of an absorbent disposable article,

such as a sanitary napkin, an incontinence guard or a
diaper, comprising the steps of applying a

laminate (1, 1') comprised of a plastic film (2) and a
layer (3, 14) of non-woven material on at least one side

of the plastic film to a perforated supportive device
(6) with the non-woven layer or one of the non-woven

layers facing towards the supportive device; heating the
plastic film (2) to a temperature above its softening

temperature; and generating a pressure difference between the two sides
of the laminate;

characterized in that the pressure difference is created with
the lower pressure at the side of the laminate facing the supportive

device and has such a magnitude
as

to cause the plastic film to rupture within the regions
of the perforations in said supportive device, so as to

form openings (10) which lead to the associated non-woven
layer (3) or to the respective associated layers

of non-woven material (3, 14).
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized

by applying a molten plastic film (2) to
a moving non-woven material (3) and thereafter subjecting

the coated non-woven material to subpressure in a
stationary suction box (8) mounted beneath the perforated

supportive device (6).
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterized

by heating the plastic film (2) of the
moving laminate (1) immediately prior to the laminate

reaching the suction box (8).
A method according to one of Claims 1-3,


characterized
 by cooling the laminate (1)
subsequent to having applied said pressure thereto. 
A method according to one of Claims 2-4,

characterized
 by heating the plastic film
(2) immediately prior to reaching the suction box (8),

by blowing hot air (7) onto the plastic film.
Top sheet material for an absorbent disposable
article, such as a sanitary napkin, an incontinence

guard or a diaper, said material comprising a laminate
(1, 1') which consists in an impervious plastic film (2)

and a layer (3, 14 ) of non-woven material on at least
one side of the plastic film, said plastic film having

been made fluid-permeable,

characterized
 in
that said plastic film (2) is provided with a

plurality of holes (13),
and that the layer of non-woven material (3) on one side of

the plastic film contains depressions or hollows (12)
which are located beneath the holes (13) in the plastic

film and the bottom surfaces of which are covered with material
(11) that has broken away from the said film.
A material according to Claim 6, 
characterized

in that the laminate (1) is comprised of
an extrusion coated layer of non-woven material (3).
A material according to Claim 6, 
characterized

in that the laminate is comprised of an
extrusion laminate (1') which includes a plastic film

(2) extruded between two layers (3, 14) of non-woven
material.
A material according to Claim 7 or 8,

characterized
 in that the non-woven layer
(3) or the non-woven layers (3, 14) contains or contain

a large proportion of fibres whose softening temperature
is higher than the softening temperature of the plastic

film (2). 
A material according to claim 9, 
characterized

in that the plastic film (2) is comprised
of polyethylene and the layer (3) of non-woven material

or the layers (3, 14 ) of non-woven material is/are
comprised of a mixture of poly-propylene fibres and

bicomponent fibres which are comprised of a polypropylene
core encased in a polyethylene casing.
