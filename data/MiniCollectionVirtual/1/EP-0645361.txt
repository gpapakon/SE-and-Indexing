<ABSTRACT>
Alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic acid is produced by 
a process comprising the addition of 1,3-butadiene to 

alkoxyalkylbenzene to yield an adduct. The adduct is 
cyclized in the presence of an acid catalyst to alkoxyalkyltetralin. 

The tetralin derivative is then dehydrogenated 
to produce aloxyalkylnaphthalene, which is 

oxidized to alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method of producing 
alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic acid. Hydroxynaphthalenecarboxylic 
acid, which is either alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic acid or a 
reaction product formed during the dealkylation of alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic 
acid, has been used widely as an 
intermediate raw material in different fields of medicine, 
agricultural chemicals, resin materials, electronic materials 
and the like. As a production method of hydroxynaphthalenecarboxylic 
acid, the Kolbe-Schmitt process has been widely used for a long 
time. This is a well-known method by which the compound is 
synthesized by virtue of heating a naphtholates salt and carbon 
dioxide under pressure. However, the aforementioned method employed in producing 
hydroxynaphthalenecarboxylic acid by the Kolbe-Schmitt process 
applied to naphthol has disadvantages, among which is the fact 
that the number of synthesizable isomers is limited. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to 
provide a novel method for producing alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic 
acid which is a precursor of hydroxynaphthalenecarboxylic acid. 
Alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic acid is among the isomers that are 
very hard to synthesize using the Kolbe-Schmitt process with 
naphthol.  As a result of continuous and diligent efforts on 
research and experiments to synthesize alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic 
acid which is not feasibly synthesized by the 
Kolbe-Schmitt process using naphthol, the present inventors 
have found that the addition reaction of 1,3-butadiene to 
alkoxyalkylbenzene was not known, while on the other hand 
the addition reaction of 1,3-butadiene to alkylbenzene 
usually in the presence of alkaline metallic catalysts is 
known. The addition reaction of 1,3-butadiene to alkoxyalkylbenzene 
can be considered as a known addition reaction 
of olefin to the alkyl group of an alkylaromatic hydrocarbon 
having a benzylic hydrogen. Furhtermore, the present inventors 
had come to the findings that (1) alkoxylalkyltetralin can be 
prepared through the reactions of adding 1,3-butadiene to 
alkoxyalkylbenzene followed by cyclization, (2) alkoxyalkylnaphthalene 
can be produced by the dehydrogenation reaction 
of alkoxyalkyltetralin, and (3) alkoxynaphthalenecarboxylic 
acid can be obtained through the oxidation of the alkoxyalkylnaphthalene. The first aspect of the present invention relates to a 
production process for alkoxyalkyltetralin which comprises, in 
the presence of the alkali metal catalysts essential for the 
reaction to take
