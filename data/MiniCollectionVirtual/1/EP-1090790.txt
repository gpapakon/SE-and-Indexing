Convertible vehicle provided with a hardtop stowable in the luggage compartment, wherein the hardtop comprises at least one front roof part and one rear roof part which adjoins the luggage compartment, the front roof part can be pushed in under the rear roof part along first lateral guideways connected to the rear roof part, to form one roof part package, wherein with the rear flap open, the rear roof part with the front roof part pushed in thereunder can be displaced into the luggage compartment as a roof part package, along second lateral guideways mounted in the luggage compartment, 
characterised in that
 the second guideways which are each mounted laterally in the luggage compartment (2) comprise mutually opposed, parallel S-shaped guide rails (21), that connected to the rear roof part (5) at its rear, laterally lower regions are two guide members (22), spaced apart from one another, and each guided on the associated S-shaped guide rail (21), and that the S-shaped guide rails (21) are mounted such that the roof part package (19) can be stowed in a luggage compartment region immediately under the closed rear flap (13), so that a luggage compartment region lying thereunder between the luggage compartment floor (26) and the stowed roof part package (19) is usable.
Convertible vehicle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the S-shaped guide rails (21) each begin at the upper forward luggage compartment region with a flat first S-bend (23) directed rearwardly and downwardly, such that given a short displacing motion of the rear roof part (5), said rear roof part (5) tilts upwardly in the region of the front roof part (4) due to the forced guidance of the respectively spaced guide
 members (22), that in their further rearward course, the S-shaped guide rails (21) each have an approximately straight rearwardly downwardly directed straight guiding region (24) running to approximately half the luggage compartment height, and that in their rear end region, the S-shaped guide rails (21) each have a second similar rearwardly upwardly ending S-bend (25), that in the front region, the roof part package (19) is tiltable downwardly and is tiltable overall into an approximately horizontal stowing position (20).
Convertible vehicle according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the S-shaped guide rails (21) are constructed as U-profiles and the guide members (22) towards the roof part are constructed as guide rollers engaging therein.
Convertible vehicle according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the rear flap (13) laterally encompasses the rear region of the rear roof part (5) with forwardly facing rear flap side members (14), and that rear flap tilt bearings (15) are arranged in the front end region of the rear flap side members (14) for tilting up the rear flap (13), so that with the rear flap (13) open, a large passage region (16) is provided between the rear flap side members (14) for the passage of the stowable roof part package (19).
Convertible vehicle according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the first lateral guideways are parallel sliding guideways (7), each comprising a rearward guide rail member (8) and a forward, associated slide member (9), that the rearward guide rail members (8) are mounted pivotable on guide rail pivot bearings (11) at their end side about a transverse axis (10) at the rear region of the rear roof part (5) and can be supported
 downwardly by at least one stop (12), wherein the guide rail members (8) extend under the rear roof part (5) approximately over the length of the rear roof part, that the forward slide members (9) are connected to the front roof part (4), and that the rear roof part (5) can be lifted in its front region at the start of a stowing procedure, wherein the rearward guide rail members (8) are pivotable relative to the rear roof part (5) and downwardly supportable approximately according to their starting position, so that the front roof part (4) can be displaced under the rear roof part (5) along the sliding guideways (7) through the gap formed thereby between the rear roof part (5) and the front roof part (4).
Convertible vehicle according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the sliding guideways (7) are constructed as telescopic rail guides, preferably roller bearing telescopic rail guides and each rearward guide rail member (8) is a rearward telescopic rail member and the forward slide member (9) is an associated forward telescopic rail member.
Convertible vehicle according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the telescopic rail members (8) are bent, seen in side view, into the form of a circular arc segment.
Convertible vehicle according to one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 sealing profiles are arranged at all contact surfaces of the front roof part (4) and of the rear roof part (5) and/or at adjoining contact members.
Convertible vehicle according to one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 a helix cable drive is used for the displacement of the front roof part (4) under the rear roof part (5) and/or for the displacement of the roof part package (19) into the stowing position (20).
Convertible vehicle according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
, for automatic actuation of the arrangement, a control device (17) and at least one drive motor (18) are used, wherein for opening the hardtop (3), in a first control step the rear flap (13) is opened, in a second control step, the rear roof part (5) is moved somewhat rearwardly and is thereby tilted somewhat upwardly at the front, in a third control step the front roof part (4) is displaced under the rear roof part (5), forming the roof part package (19), in a fourth control step the roof part package (19) is displaced into its stowing position (20) and in a fifth control step the rear flap (13) is closed, and wherein, for closing the hardtop (3), the procedure can be carried out with the control steps reversed.
