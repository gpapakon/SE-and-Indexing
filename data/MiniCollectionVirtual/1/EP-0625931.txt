<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a starter bar used in 
continuous casting to plug the outlet of a mold containing 
molten metal and for leading the casting out of the mold through 
a curved casting train. In particular, this invention relates 
to an advantageous structure for the starter bar in which the 
leading end adjacent the casting is substantially rigid and the 
trailing end is flexible. Rigid starter bars are generally more desirable than 
flexible bars because they are inherently self-supporting and 
thus the support rolls and associated structure required for 
flexible bars can be omitted. Not only does this simplify the 
installation, it minimizes the equipment which would have to be 
maintained or replaced in the event of a catastrophic molten 
metal breakout from the mold. A disadvantage of rigid bars is that they occupy a lot 
of space during storage in locations already cramped with runout 
tables, platforms, overhead cranes and other equipment. This 
problem is addressed by flexible bars which may be stored in 
either a flat configuration, or a curved configuration having a 
smaller radius of curvature than the casting train. In U.S. 4,291,748 to Langner, it is proposed to combine 
the advantages of a rigid bar with those of a flexible bar by 
using a bar having a rigid portion disposed at the leading end 
adjacent the casting and a flexible portion at the tail end. 
The rigid portion is constructed from a single piece having a 
radius corresponding to that of the casting train and has a 
length roughly equal to one-half the distance between the mold 
and the straightener. The flexible end comprises a number of 
solid long links each having a tongue and groove to cooperate 
with adjacent blocks and secured by through pins which permit 
limited, relative pivotal movement between the links so that the 
tail may be stored in a curved configuration to a radius which  
 
is smaller than that of the casting train. While the proposal made in Langner to combine a rigid 
portion with a flexible portion is elegant, the structure 
described to achieve the claimed advantages has its own 
shortcomings. Because of its one piece construction, the rigid 
portion of the bar has to be manufactured within close 
tolerances in order for its shape to match the curvature of the 
casting arc. In use, the rigid portion is subjected to pinch roll 
forces in the straightener system and these tend to distort its 
geometry, and thus frequent reshaping or replacement of this 
component is required. Heat treatment to

A starter bar (20) for closing a mold (24) in a 
continuous casting machine and for guiding the leading end of a 

casting (28) from the mold (24) in a curved casting path, the 
starter bar (20) having a head (22) at one end of the bar (20) 

for attachment to the leading end of the casting (28), a tail 
(38) at the other end of the bar (20) for guiding the bar (20) 

between rollers (30) forming part of the continuous casting 
machine, and a body disposed between the head (22) and the tail 

(38) including a flexible first portion (40) adjacent the tail 
(38) and a substantially rigid second portion (36) adjacent the 

head (22), characterized in that the body comprises:
 
   a spine (61) disposed on an operatively inner side of 

the body and defining an inner radius of curvature for the 
starter bar (20) lying in said curved casting path;
 
   a series of blocks (60,62,63) disposed on an 

operatively outer side of the body arranged end to end and 
attached on one side thereof to the operatively outer surface of 

the spine (61,64,66), the blocks thereby defining an outer 
radius of curvature for the starter bar (20) lying in said 

curved casting path; and
 
   a plurality of spacing means (92) corresponding in 

number to the blocks (60,62,63) disposed between respective 
pairs of blocks, the spacing means (92) being arranged so that 

the blocks (60,62,63) will lie in a self-supporting abutting 
relationship when the starter bar (20) is in a curved 

configuration corresponding to said curved casting path and 
adapted to prevent the bar (20) from flexing in a direction away 

from the spine (61,64,66), the spine (66) in the flexible first 
portion (40) of the sta
rter bar (20) being substantially more 
flexible than the spine (64) in the rigid second portion (36) of 

the sorter bar (20), the associated blocks (62) in the flexible 
first portion (40) being adapted to allow the first portion (40) 

to be bent to a radius of curvature which is substantially less than 
the radius of curvature of said curved casting path. 
Starter bar (20) according to Claim 1 in which the  
 

spine (61,64,66) is segmented into a series of plates arranged 
end to end. 
Starter bar (20) according to claim 1 in which the 
spine (64) of the rigid second portion (36) is thicker than the 

spine (66) or, the flexible first portion (40). 
Starter bar (20) according to Claim 1 in which the 
blocks (60) of the rigid portion (36) are more massive than the 

blocks (62) in the flexible portion (40) and each block (60) in 
the rigid portion (36) occupies a greater segment of the arc 

than the blocks (62) in the flexible portion (40). 
Starter bar (20) according to Claim 1 in which the 
spine (66) of the flexible first portion (40) comprises a 

laminated structure of which an outer layer (85) comprises a 
metal sheet and an inner layer (83) comprises a synthetic 

plastic material and the associated blocks (62) have oppositely 
directed shoulders (86) extending along the length thereof for 

receiving the spine (66) therebetween and imparting lateral 
stability to the spine (66) in said flexible first portion (40).
