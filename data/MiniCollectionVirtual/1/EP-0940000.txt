<ABSTRACT>
This switched reluctance machine has at least six magnet yokes (11) on the stator side. The yokes are placed circularly and they carry windings (112). These yokes (11) can be placed at the inner side and/or the outer side of the rotor (12). These yokes which are magnetically insulated to each other interact with the salient poles (121) of the rotor (12). The two phases (X, Y) of this machine are push-pull controlled by a Hall sensor (31). This way the electronic circuitry becomes very simple.

this motor comprises two machines as two-phase machine halfs, operative independently
the one from the other, which are arranged with an offset angle in

the sense of rotation and that this motor comprises U-yokes (11), arranged on a
