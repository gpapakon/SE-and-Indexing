<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid type programmer comprising a microprocessor is 
described, for washing machines, in particular dish-washing 

machines; the main characteristic of the described programmer 
consists in that the microprocessor periodically receives 

amounts of information, concerning the state of a single 
electromechanical switch, commanded by a cam, activating a 

certain organ, and elaborates such information in order to 
control the advancement of the machine's operative program.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a hybrid type programmer comprising a 
microprocessor, for washing machines, in particular dish-washing 
machines. Normally dish-washing machines are equipped with a programmer, 
or timer, of an electromechanical type, wherein a series of cams 
are commanded by a micro-motor and determine, by way of the 
opening and closure of electric contacts, the functioning of the 
various organs of the machine, such as the washing pump, the 
drainage pump, the water charging solenoid valves, the heating 
resistor, etc; the electromechanical timers are very 
complicated; they require slow cams, fast cams and various 
ratchets. Dish-washing machines are also known equipped with fully 
electronic programmers, controlled by a microprocessor; the main 
drawback of electronic timers consists in the necessity of 
providing a non volatile memory, and the relative management of 
transients, for remembering without problems the advancement 
position reached, in the case of interruption of the power 
supply. So called hybrid programmers are also known, i.e. of a combined 
type, mechanical and electronic, in which appropriate 
codification contacts are used, in a sufficient number for 
supplying the electronic part (microprocessor) with information 
on the angular position reached by the mechanical timer; such 
contacts can for example be of 5 or 6 in number.  For example, it is known from the European patent application n. 
⊘ 252 816 a hybrid mechanical and electronic timer for a laundry 
washing machine; in such timer a microprocessor controls by 
means of a triac the step by step advancement of the micro-motor 
of the timer, which with its cams, normally provides to activate 
and deactivate the pumps, the heating resistor and the electro-valves; 
the microprocessor receives information, obtained by 
summing the voltage present at the ends of three suitable 
electromechanical codification contacts, so as to know the 
position reached; the microprocessor, by way of a second triac, 
controls the rotation motor of the laundry drum. Such timer however, besides requiring three codification 
contacts, does not appear to be able to manage a plurality of 
different programs. The aim of the present invention is that of illustrating how it 
is possible to realise a hybrid type programmer for a washing 
machine, in particular a dish-washing machine, that, without 
requiring codification contacts, allows the electronic 
management of the advancement of a sufficient number of 
different programs. For reaching
