<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of
converting partially purified taxane mixtures into
baccatin III or 10-deacetylbaccatin III. Specifically, the
present invention relates to a process using borohydride
reducing salts in the presence of Lewis acids to convert
10-deacetyltaxol, cephalomannine, taxol and other taxanes
into related baccatins.Taxol, (1)

is a diterpenoid found in the Western Yew, (Taxus
brevifolia). Taxol has shown excellent anticancer activity
in clinical trials. However, extensive testing of taxol
has been difficult because it is extracted from a natural
vegetation that is in short supply. To avoid depletion of
the plant life that contains taxanes total synthesis of
taxol has been attempted, but so far these attempts have
been unsuccessful. However, significant strides have been
made in the semi-synthesis of taxol from other naturally
occurring taxanes such as baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin 
III. At least three different methods of
converting baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin III into
taxol have been reported.The structure of Baccatin III

has the basic diterpenoid structure of taxol without the
side chain at the C-13 position and with R1 = COCH3. The
structure of 10-deacetylbaccatin III is similar to the
structure above except at the C-10 position R1 = H. Thus,
due to the basic diterpene structure, baccatin III and the
other related baccatins such as 10-deacetylbaccatin III are
important starting materials in taxol semi-synthesis. The
significance of baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin III is
expected to increase as more taxol cancer testing is
performed. Already it appears that water soluble taxol-like
compounds with slightly modified C-13 side chains may
be more desirable as cancer drugs than the natural
occurring, less soluble, taxol. This increases the
unresolved need for baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin
III as a starting material to synthesize taxol and second
and third generation taxol-like compounds.The present source of baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin
III is an extraction from natural
vegetation containing taxanes such as the English Yew
(Taxus baccatta). The supply of these raw materials is 
baccatin III. The conversion of 10- deacetyltaxol and
other taxanes into 10-deacetylbaccatin III is a viable
method of increasing the supply of 10-deacetylbaccatin III.Miller reported that cephalomannine was converted in
a 19% yield to baccatin III by methanolysis in the presence
of sodium bicarbonate. See, Journal of Organic Chemistry,
