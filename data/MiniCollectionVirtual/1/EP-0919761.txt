<ABSTRACT>
The total of the lengths (24,28) of the sections (22,26) either side of the heated section (12) is greater than the length (16) of the heated section. The total insertion length (34) is at least 1.4, preferably 1.7, times greater than the sleeve diameter (18). Other preferred proportions are also specified and there are correction factors for diameters other than 50 mm.

Welding sleeve with a continuous cylindrical sleeve
element (2) made of fusible plastics material and with a

heating spiral (6, 7) arranged in the interior face (5)
thereof, which spiral is arranged at a distance from the free

sleeve end (20) over a leading zone (22) and can be charged
with electric current, wherein a connection can be produced by

a pipe made of fusible plastics material which can be inserted
into the sleeve element (2), and furthermore with an interior

zone (26) with an axial length (28) adjoining the heating
spiral (6, 7), on which zone (26) the inserted pipe comes to

rest, the sum of the length (24) of the leading zone (22) and
the length (28) of the interior zone (26) being equal to or

greater than the length (16) of the heating spiral (6, 7),

characterised in that
 the ratio which is formed from the axial
length (28) of the interior zone (26), based on the internal

diameter (18), is in the range between 0.4 and 0.9, and

 the insertion depth (34) is greater by at least a factor
of 1.4 than the internal diameter (18) of the sleeve element

(2).
