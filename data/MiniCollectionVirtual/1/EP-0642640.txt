<ABSTRACT>
Device for high speed coupling of pressurized fluid pipes comprising: a female section (2), wherein is lodged the end of the pipe (1) to be coupled, said female section carrying a seal (16); two hooks each tilting about a pin (8) and mounted diametrically opposite on and adjacent to the end (1) to be coupled, the hooks being associated with a spring return device (9) which holds them in contact with said end; and a continuous peripheral rim (14) at the end of the female section (2) which cooperates with the hooks (7) that lock on the latter. The hooks (7) are made of an acetal resin, the peripheral rim (14) being fully made from a polypropylene-type homogenous plastic material containing glass fibres. On of the primary applications of the invention is in high speed coupling of non-rigid or semi-rigid pipes, such as those used for irrigation and watering of large surfaces.

<CLAIMS>
A quick coupling device for pipework for fluid under pressure, the 
device comprising a female portion (2) in which the end of the 

pipework (1) to be coupled is received and carrying a sealing ring 
(16), and including at its end a continuous peripheral ring (14) of a 

shape that co-operates with that of a hook (7) carried by the 
pipework (1) and capable of latching thereon by tilting about an axis 

(8) by means of an associated spring return system (9), the device 
being characterized in that it includes two hooks (7) mounted 

diametrically opposite each other close to the end (1) of the 
pipework to be coupled, on a collar (3) including at least one flange 

(6) for clamping the collar around the pipework (1) by an adjustable 
fastening (5) and internal serrations (4) which engage in the outside 

surface of the pipework (1), which hooks and said peripheral ring 
(14) are made entirely of homogeneous plastics material. 
A coupling device according to claim 1, characterized in that each 
hook (7) has a rounded front shape with the portion (11) thereof 

situated towards the outside surface of the pipework (1) being at 
least inclined running from the point of contact (20) with the end of 

the ring (14) when it presses against said hooks, thereby enabling 
them to be lifted, and also has a curved portion (12) which is 

engaged behind said ring (14) after the hooks (10) have tilted, by 
means of the spring return system (9). 
A coupling device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
contact points (20) are situated on a diameter D1 no greater than the 

diameter D2 corresponding to the positioning of the tilt axes (8) of 
the hooks (7). 
A coupling device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that said hooks (7), said collar (3), and the female 

portion (2) are all black in color. 
A coupling device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that said hooks (7) are made of acetal resin and the 

female portion (2) and the collar (3) are made of polyolefin  
 

reinforced with inorganic fibers, of the glass fiber reinforced 
polypropylene type. 
A coupling device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the gasket (16) is a lip gasket situated in a 

groove (17) formed in the ring (14) of the female portion (2). 
A coupling device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that it includes a metal insert (13) slid into the 

pipework (1) at least in register with the clamping collar (3) and 
the gasket (16).
