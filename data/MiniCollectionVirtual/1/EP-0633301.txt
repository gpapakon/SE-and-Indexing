<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive composition useful for bonding 
thermoplastic elastomers to substrates such as metal that 

contain a halogenated polyolefin that has been chemically 
modified to contain a sulfur-containing compound. The 

modified polyolefin is preferably prepared by first reacting 
the polyolefin with an acid anhydride and then reacting the 

anhydride-modified polyolefin with the sulfur-containing 
compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a novel, chemically modified 
polymeric material that can be used to provide excellent adhesion between 
injection molded polyolefinic thermoplastic elastomers and metal 
substrates onto which the thermoplastic elastomer is molded. More 
particularly, the invention relates to halogenated polyolefins, such as 
chlorinated polypropylene, which have been modified to contain certain 
polyhydroxylic aromatic compounds and/or certain sulfur-containing 
compounds. In general, polyolefinic thermoplastic elastomers, such as those 
where polypropylene is the matrix and cured rubber forms a discrete 
second phase (e.g., SANTOPRENE supplied by Monsanto), adhere poorly to 
metal, glass, and other substrates. When these types of elastomers are 
molded against a substrate, such as a metal insert in injection molding, an 
adhesive must first be applied to the substrate to ensure sufficient adhesion 
between the elastomer and the substrate. Chlorinated polyolefins and modified chlorinated polyolefins are well 
known to provide adhesion to polyolefinic materials, such as polyolefinic  
 
thermoplastic elastomers and polypropylene (Eastman Chemicals 
Publication No. GN-360-C, August, 1988; Eastman Chemicals Publication 
No. X-294, March, 1989). The influence of the amount of chlorine, the 
molecular weight of the polymer, its melting point, and other variables on 
the efficacy of adhesion between chlorinated polypropylene and polyolefinic 
substrates has been reported by Fujimoto (F. Fujimoto, Paint and Resin, 
February, 1986, p. 36.). Chlorinated polyolefins are, for example, the 
primary ingredient in primers used to bond to polyolefins (Renout, 
European Patent Application 0 187 171, July 1986). Chlorinated polyolefins do not, however, strongly adhere to other 
materials such as metal. Eckhardt (U. S. Patent No. 3,620,860) describes 
chlorinated polymers of ethylene that are claimed to be effective temporary 
bonding agents for metals, but the substrates bonded by those chlorinated 
polymers are readily separated from each other. In order to attain 
adhesion between compositions containing chlorinated polyolefins and 
other materials, the chlorinated polyolefins must typically be mixed with 
other ingredients. Van Meesche and Radar (A. Van Meesche and C. 
Radar, Elastomerics, September, 1987, p. 21) describe compositions that are 
mixtures of modified polyolefins (chlorinated polyolefins) and polyurethane 
resins. These compositions are reported to provide adhesion to a wide 
vari
