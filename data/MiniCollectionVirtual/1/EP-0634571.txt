<ABSTRACT>
An intake apparatus of a diesel engine includes a 
plurality of intake ports (3,4) provided in each of cylinders. The 

respective intake ports (3,4) have throat portions (3a,4a) which extend 
straightly to a cylinder bore (2) of each of the cylinders. The 

respective intake ports (3,4) are provided to be directed to the 
tangential line of the cylinder on the surface orthogonal to 

a cylinder axial line (V
R
,V
F
) and to be directed in the 
same swirl 

flow directions. The intake ports (3,4) includes a front intake 
port (4) located at the front side in the swirl flow direction 

and a rear intake port (3) located at the rear side in the swirl 
flow direction. The front intake port (4) and the rear intake 

port (3) are provided so that velocity distribution of the intake 
air from the front intake port (4) is more directed to the 

swirl direction than that from the rear intake port (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intake apparatus of
a diesel engine, and in particular, to an intake apparatus of
a diesel engine having a plurality of intake ports in each of
cylinders, all of the intake ports being straight ports and
the incidence angles of the intake ports on the surface
orthogonal to the cylinder axial line being provided in the
directions along the tangential lines of the cylinders.There is known a diesel engine in which two intake
ports are provided in each of the cylinders so as to improve
volumetric efficiency and the intake ports are arranged so
that the intake airs from the respective intake ports flow
into the cylinder bore in the same directions so as to
improve fuel combustion by causing swirl flow.In the conventional diesel engine having two intake
valves in each of the cylinders, one of the two intake ports
is a helical port whose throat portion communicating with the
cylinder bore is arranged to be spiral and the other of the
two intake ports is a straight port whose throat portion is
arranged to be straight and the incidence angle of the other 
intake port is provided in the direction along the tangential
line of the cylinder. In this conventional diesel engine,
the swirl ratio becomes high because of the one helical port
and the volumetric efficiency decreases because of large flow
resistance caused by the helical port.Recently, the diesel engine has obtained an improved
fuel combustion with a low swirl ratio since a fuel injection
system is improved. Therefore, the diesel engine having
high volumetric efficiency with a low swirl ratio has been
demanded. In order to obtain much higher volumetric
efficiency with the necessary low swirl ratio, a diesel
engine has been proposed in which both of the intake ports
are arranged to be straight and tangential.Such diesel engine is disclosed for example in Japanese
Utility Model Unexamined Publication No. 62-144. The diesel
engine includes two intake ports in each of the cylinders,
both of the intake ports being straight and tangential.
Further, the one port arranged in the rear direction of the
swirl flow is located near the intake edge surface of the
cylinder head and the other port arranged in the front
direction of the swirl flow is located far from the intake
edge surface of the cylinder head.However, though the diesel engine with two intake ports
being both straight and tangential has been proposed as
described above, the volumetric efficiency is not actually
improved so much and the emission characteristics becomes
