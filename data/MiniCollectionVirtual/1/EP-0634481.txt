<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a low temperature process for 
washing laundry in a domestic washing machine and detergent 

compositions suitable for use in such a process. In the 
process of the invention an effective amount of a laundry 

detergent composition is introduced into the wash liquor 
during the wash and the process is conducted at a 

temperature of no more than 50°C, the laundry preferably 
comprising hydrophobic materials such as polyester or 

polycotton. The detergent composition comprising an alkali 
metal percarbonate and one or more non-ionic cellulose 

derivatives. The washing process of the invention leads to 
improved whiteness benefits and reduced dispensing problems 

when compared with processes in which detergent 
compositions are used which contain perborate as a 

bleaching agent instead of percarbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low temperature process
for washing laundry in a domestic washing machine and to
detergent compositions suitable for use in such a process
which comprise alkali metal percarbonate and non-ionic
cellulose derivatives.Non-ionic cellulose derivatives, in particular
cellulose ethers, are known to be useful as anti-redeposition
agents. They are particularly useful in
preventing the redeposition of greasy stains on hydrophobic
fabrics such as polyester or polycotton. Redeposition is
believed to be prevented at least in part by the formation
of a release coating of the non-ionic cellulose derivatives
on the hydrophobic fabric.It is known to provide laundry detergent compositions
incorporating an inorganic perhydrate salt as a source of
oxygen bleach. The inorganic perhydrate bleach most widely
used in laundry detergent composition is sodium perborate
in the form of either the monohydrate or tetrahydrate.
Percarbonate is a known bleach for use in detergents, such as
for example disclosed in EP-A-508934, GB-A-1534641 and
US-A-4854333.It is believed that on dissolution in water, perborate
gives borate ions and that these borate ions are capable of
forming ionic complexes with α(vicinal) diols such as
cellulose derivatives. Such ionic complexes have increased
solubility over the non-complexed cellulose derivative and
their deposition onto hydrophobic fabrics is hampered.
Hence achievement of brightness by prevention of
redeposition of greasy stains is hindered and in order to
achieve adequate performance it is often found necessary to
increase the percentage of cellulose derivative in the
detergent composition.It is desirable to keep levels of cellulose derivative
to a minimum, both for cost reasons and because high levels
are can lead to dispensing and formulation problems.According to the invention there is provided a laundry
detergent composition comprising:
(a) an alkali metal percarbonate (b) one or more non-ionic cellulose derivatives
selected from hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and
methyl cellulose, one or more additional bleaching agents
selected from peroxy acid bleach percursors, organic peroxy acids
and mixtures thereof.According to the invention there is also provided a
process of washing laundry in a domestic
washing machine, in which an effective amount of a laundry
detergent composition of the invention is introduced into
the wash liquor during the wash, wherein the process is
conducted at a temperature of no more than 50°C. The non-ionic
