<ABSTRACT>
A shift lever apparatus for an automatic transmission 
includes first (41) and second levers (42), which are pivotally 

supported on the positioning plate (10) by a shaft (45), and a lock 
lever (43), which is pivotally supported by a shaft (47) which extends 

at right angles to the shaft (45) of the second lever (42). 
The apparatus also includes 

a spring (46) for energizing the first (41) and second levers (42) so as 
to draw the arms (41b,42b) of the first (41) and second levers (42) close 

together and to restrain the positioning pin (31) positioned at 
the parking position. Even though an actuator (44) is connected 

to and actuates the lock lever (43) so as to rotate it in 
predetermined directions, since the lock lever (43) of the arm 

is pressed by the first lever (41) when the positioning pin (31) is 
positioned at the parking position, the lock lever (43) can be 

stabilized under the positioning pin (31) to lock it at the 
parking position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shift lever apparatus 
provided for a vehicle, with the features cited in the preamble 
of claims 1 and 3 respectively. A shift lever apparatus of this type is known from 
US-A-4,880,092 wherein the first lever is integrally formed 
with a movable body which is slidable along the shift lever. 
The first lever is formed as one side of a recess in which the 
positioning pin may be inserted from the direction of the 
running position. After the positioning pin is inserted in a 
lower lock release position, the movable body is slit together 
with the positioning pin in an upper lock position. The 
locking lever is a rotatable lever which may be positioned 
under the movable body so that the front face of the lock lever 
abuts against the underside of the movable body for preventing 
sliding the movable body to the lower lock release position. 
This construction basically proved successful in practice, 
however, still needs improvements regarding accuracy of the 
movements of its elements and an easy, practical and reliable 
handling.  
 Another shift lever apparatus has been disclosed in the 
Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 60-135352. In 
this shift lever apparatus, as shown in Fig. 1, a base 
portion 1a of a shift lever 1 is pivotally supported on a 
machine casing 7 and a positioning pin 2 is arranged on the 
shift lever 1 so as to freely move upwards and downwards. 
The positioning pin 2 is energized upwards by energizing 
means (not shown) at all times and can be moved downwards 
when a knob button (not shown) provided on the upper part 
of the shift lever 1 is pressed. A bell-crank 4 with an 
engaging slot 4a is pivotally supported on a positioning 
plate 3 and is energized by a spring 8 at all times so as 
to rotate clockwise. The engaging slot 4a of the bell-crank 
4 engages with the positioning pin 2 when the 
positioning pin 2 is at the parking position (P) of an 
opening 3a formed in the positioning plate 3. Further, a 
key-lock-cable 6 which operates in conjunction with a key-interlock 
mechanism (not shown) is connected to the bell-crank 
4. When the above-described shift lever apparatus is in a 
steering-lock state in which the engine key is removed from 
the key-interlock mechanism, if a user tries, pressing the 
knob button, to move the positioning pin 2 downwards so 
that the positioning pin 2 moves from the parking position 
(P) toward a running position, the bell-crank 4 rotates  
 
clockwise. Consequently, a feeding force acts upon the 
key-lock
