<ABSTRACT>
In a connector for use in connection between a pair of 
connection objects opposite to each other, each having a number 

of contact holes arranged in rows and columns in a contact 
matrix, a plurality of flat and elastic multi-contact members 

are used for connecting contacts in the contact holes of one 
connection object with contacts in the contact holes of the 

other connection object. Each of the multi-contact members 
comprises a flexible and flat insulator sheet and conductive 

layers formed on opposite surfaces of the sheet. At least one 
of the conductive layers are separated into a plurality of 

conductive strips corresponding to contact holes in one row of 
the contact matrix. The conductive strips are fitted into 

contact holes in the corresponding row of contact matrix at 
opposite ends of each of the multi-contact members. When the 

connection objects are relatively moved in the direction 
perpendicular to the first direction and the rows, the opposite 

ends of the conductive strips are brought into press contact 
with contact elements in the contact holes due to elastic 

deformation of the multi-contact member. One of the conductive 
layers on the opposite surfaces of the sheet can be an integral 

film overlying the corresponding surface. In that case, one of 
two contact elements in each of contact holes is used as ground 

contact to be brought into contact with the integral film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connection system for
electrically connecting a pair of connection objects opposite
to each other in a first direction and, in particular, to a
connector which can carry out connection and disconnection
between the connection objects in accordance with a relative
movement of the connection objects in a second direction
perpendicular to the first direction.For example, a conventional connector of the type is
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 42309/1989
(JP(Y2) 1-42309). The connector is for electrically connecting
two pin contacts to each other and includes an
electroconductive socket contact. The socket contact has two
socket portions each having a size that allows the pin contact
to be loosely fitted or inserted thereinto, and a flexible
elastic portion connecting these socket portions to each other.Prior to electrical connection, the pin contacts are
inserted into the respective socket portions. In this event,
no special force is required for insertion of the contacts
since each socket portion has such the size to allow the pin 
contact to be loosely inserted thereinto. Accordingly, the
conventional connector will be called a zero-insertion force
connector.Then, two pin contacts are moved opposite to each other
in a radial direction. The socket portions are brought into
press contact with the pin contacts while the flexible elastic
portions being elastically bent. As a result, two pin contacts
are electrically connected to each other through the socket
contact.The above-mentioned connector uses the socket contact
including two socket portions formed at opposite ends of the
flexible elastic portion and, therefore, has a complicated
structure. The use of socket contacts makes it difficult to
assemble a high-density small-sized connector and reduces the
productivity thereof.In order to insure insertion of the pin contacts into
the socket portions, a positioning member may be necessary to
hold the socket portions at preselected positions. It is
generally difficult to install the positioning member because
of complicated structure of the socket portions. This will
readily be understood in view of the fact that the connector
disclosed in the above-mentioned publication comprises no
positioning member. Accordingly, the socket portions may
suffer from misalignment. In this event, the pin contacts fail
to be correctly inserted into the socket portions.From EP 0 571 879 A - which forms prior art under Art. 54 (3,4) EPC - an 
electrical connector can be taken where
