<ABSTRACT>
A monitor system with automatic recording control including a 
plurality of monitoring units (1) respectively installed in different 

monitoring spots, and a central processing unit (2) for controlling a 
video tape recorder to record images taken by either monitoring units, 

each monitoring unit including a detection trigger (11) connected to the 
signal input port of the microprocessor unit through a starting switch 

(13), the starting switching being connected to the reset contact legs 
of the microprocessor unit through an auto reset switch (5), and a video 

camera (12) being connected to the output port of the microprocessor 
unit through an electronic switch (14), the microprocessor unit having a 

first set of output control legs connected to a remote control circuit 
thereof, and a second set of output control legs for communication with 

the remote controller of a video tape recorder or for connecting to the 
control switch of the video tape recorder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic recording control 
and more particularly to a monitor system with automatic 
recording control for controlling a video tape recorder to record 
images taken by either monitoring unit installed in any of 
various monitoring spots. A variety of monitor systems are known, and widely used for 
monitoring elevators, exhibition centres, show rooms, storage 
places, etc. These monitor systems generally comprise a monitor 
and a video tape recorder. When a monitor system is turned on, 
the monitor and the video tape recorder keep operating 24 hours 
a day. Therefore, video tapes must be continuously supplied by 
operators. Because the monitor and the video tape recorder are 
continuously operated, their service life will be greatly 
shortened. Further, when several locations are to be monitored, 
the installation cost of the monitor system is very expensive 
because a video camera and a video tape recorder must be 
simultaneously installed at each monitoring location. The present invention provides a monitor system with automatic 
recording control which comprises a plurality of monitoring units 
respectively installed in different spots to be monitored, and 
a microprocessor unit for controlling a video tape recorder to 
record images taken by either monitoring units. Each monitoring 
unit comprises a detection trigger connected to the signal input 
legs of the microprocessor unit through a starting switch, and 
a video camera connected to the output legs of the microprocessor 
unit through an electronic switch. The starting switch is 
connected to the reset legs of the microprocessor unit through 
an auto reset switch and a manual reset switch respectively. The  
 
recording control output legs of the microprocessor unit may be 
directly connected to a video tape recorder or indirectly 
connected to the video tape recorder via a remote controller. 
When an intruder enters the detecting range of either monitoring 
unit or a respective push-button switch is pressed, the 
respective monitoring unit is triggered to start the video 
camera. At the same time, a signal is sent by the alerted 
monitoring unit to the microprocessor unit causing it to turn on 
the video tape recorder for recording the images taken by the 
video camera of the alerted monitoring unit. Therefore, the 
monitoring units and the video tape recorder do not work when no 
event is happened. An alarm system may be connected to the 
monitor system recording control. When either monitoring unit 
is
