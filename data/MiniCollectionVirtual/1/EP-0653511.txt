A process for treating a low-concentrated aqueous feed 
solution comprising at least one aqueous process stream from 

a pulp mill, which comprises concentrating the feed solution

at least a part of said concentrate to a first electrodialysis 
treatment, for forming a first electrodialysis

plant for carrying out the process according to any of the 
preceding claims which comprises an evaporator device (1) with

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for treating a 
low-concentrated aqueous feed solution comprising a salt 
solution in at least one aqueous process 
stream from a pulp mill. 
Said 
process comprises concentrating the solution by a treatment 
comprising evaporation, and subjecting at least a part 
the concentrated feed solution, also denoted evaporation 
concentrate, to a first electrodialysis treatment, for 
forming a first electrodialysis concentrate containing salt 
removed from the evaporation concentrate and at least one 
diluate depleted of said salt. The feed solution may prior to the evaporation treatment 
be subjected to a preliminary purification treatment, e.g. 
filtration, centrifugation, flotation or other mechanical 
and/or chemical separation treatments, for removing liquid and 
especially solid impurities. The feed solution may comprise at least one 
process stream, e.g. effluent, from a chlorine containing 
bleaching process. The evaporation concentrate produced in the evaporation 
treatment may have a residual volume of at most 50% of 
the volume of the feed solution. Preferably the evaporation concentrate is purified by a 
chemical and/or mechanical treatment prior to the 
electrodialysis. The invention is thus especially related to a process in 
which the feed solution comprises one or more aqueous process 
streams from a pulp mill, such as a wood pulp or other 
cellulosic pulp mill, and especially pulp bleach process 
streams, such as bleach effluent streams, formed e.g. in a 
chlorine containing bleach process or step, such as a chlorine 
or chlorine oxide bleach process, and containing e.g. chloride 
and/or chlorate, but optionally also streams formed in an 
oxygen, ozone or peroxy compound, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, 
bleach process or step, or other bleach processes or steps, or  
 
combinations of any two or more such bleach processes or 
steps. The process according to this invention may together 
with or as one or more mechanical and/or chemical purification 
step(s), especially as a first purification step after the 
evaporation step, comprise one or more of filtration, 
centrifugation, ultrafiltration, membrane filtration and 
flotation, for separating solid and/or liquid dispersed and 
especially precipitated materials from the solution, which 
forms a continuous phase. Generally, it is suitable to maintain the solids content 
in the concentrated solution in the evaporator below about 20 
% by weight, such as below 10 % or optionally below 5 %, by 
weight, e.g. by adding
