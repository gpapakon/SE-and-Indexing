<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to both thermal mass 
transfer processes and thermal dye transfer imaging. 
In particular the present invention relates to the use 
of a first thermal mass transfer coating on a substrate 
which may be mass transferred to essentially any 
receptor surface to provide an image-wise distributed 
background layer on the receptor surface having 
desirable dye receptivity to a subsequently thermally 
transferred dye. Non-imaged areas still retain the 
touch and appearance of the original, uncoated receptor 
surface. Thermal mass transfer and thermal dye transfer 
processes are technologies that bear some superficial 
similarities but which are distinct within the 
technical art. Both processes use a donor sheet and a 
receptor sheet. The thermal mass transfer donor sheet 
normally comprises a carrier layer with at least a 
thermally transferable colorant (a dye or preferably a 
pigment) in a heat softenable binder. The thermal dye 
transfer donor sheet comprises a carrier layer with at 
least a dye layer on the donor surface. The dye layer 
may consist of only dye or dye in a binder (the binder 
not transferring when the dye is thermally 
transferred). Both transfer sheets are used with the 
donor surface in intimate contact with a receptor 
material, and the donor sheet is heated in an imagewise 
manner (e.g., by thermal printheads, irradiation as by  
 
a laser or high intensity radiation transmitted through 
a mask or stencil) to transfer the image forming 
material. In the thermal mass transfer system, the 
donor layer is softened by the imagewise heating (and 
sometimes a receptor layer on the receptor sheet is 
contemporaneously softened), and the softened area is 
transferred to the receptor sheet. In thermal dye 
transfer, the dye is melted, sublimated, dissolved or 
vaporized to diffusively transfer to the receptor sheet 
and tends to be adsorbed and/or absorbed into the 
surface of the receptor element. The nature of the 
mechanism of adherence of the transferred image to the 
receptor sheet makes the nature of the surface of that 
receptor sheet important for each of the imaging 
processes. Surfaces which work well for receiving mass 
transfer images do not necessarily work well for 
thermal dye transfer. Furthermore, there are not many 
natural surfaces which can function as a high quality 
dye receptive surface. U.S. Patent No. 4,472,479 (Hayes et al.) describes 
a light barrier fluorescent ribbon for impact printing 
which comprises a carrier layer, and on one
