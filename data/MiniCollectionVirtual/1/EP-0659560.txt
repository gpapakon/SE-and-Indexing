<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for cleaning cylinders of printing machines, preferably offset printing machines. It serves to increase the service life of washing rollers and to improve the quality of cleaning. This is achieved in that the washing roller (4) is arranged in a housing (2) which has at least one movable housing part (3) for opening or closing the opening (9). The washing roller can thus be cleaned in a closed housing (2) in the thrown-off position and can be thrown on the cylinder (1) in a clean state.

<CLAIMS>
Cleaning unit for cylinders of printing presses, 
preferably offset printing presses, with at least 

one driven washing roller which can be set on and 
off from the cylinder or a driven washing cloth 

which could be set on and off, which is arranged in 
a housing provided with an opening turned towards 

the cylinder outer surface and which can be sprayed 
with liquid, characterised in that the housing (2) 

of the cleaning unit has at least one movable 
housing part (3) which, in the set on position, 

frees the opening (9) and/or in the set off position 
closes it. 
Cleaning unit according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that at least one contaminated washing roller (4) 

arranged in the housing (2) contaminated in the set 
on position with the cover surface of the cylinder 

(1) is cleaned in the set off position with the 
opening (9) in housing (2) closed by means of 

housing part (3). 
Cleaning unit according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the clean washing roller (4) in the set off 

position, with opening (9) in housing (2) closed via 
the housing portion (3), is in the rest position. 
Cleaning unit according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the washing roller (4) is an 

oscillating washing brush extending across the 
entire width of the cylinder (1). 
Cleaning unit according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the housing (2) receiving the washing roller 

(4) or the washing cloth is liftable off at a  
 

defined circular sector from the cylinder (1), e.g. 
in the region of the gripper bridge of an impression 

cylinder. 
Cleaning unit according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the washing roller (4) is 

coordinated with a mechanical or electrical sensor 
to detect the degree of contamination.
