<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a multi-layer laminate consisting of a metal plate, and layers of a reinforcing fiber-containing fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin and provided on the surface of the metal plate. This multi-layer laminate is free from rust and 

corrosion, and has excellent noise eliminating, soundproofing and vibration damping effects. Namely, this multi-layer laminate 
makes a direct use of the features of the fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin, and has the excellent mechanical strength of the metal 

plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a multilayer
laminate obtained by laminating a fiber-reinforced
thermoplastic resin layer containing reinforcing fiber,
on one or each side of an aluminum plate.Metal plates are characterized by having an
excellent mechanical strength and have heretofore been
used as various materials. But, they are not sufficiently
light in weight, are subject to rusting and
corrosion because of their low water resistance and
chemical resistance, and have been unsuitable for use as
vibration-damping boards,
acoustic insulation materials, etc. because of direct
reflection of vibrations, sounds, etc. from the
outside on the metal plates.As materials free from such defects of the
metal plates, there are known, for example, laminates
obtained by coating or plating one side or both sides of
a metal plate with a resin for preventing rusting and
corrosion.However, although such laminates possess
somewhat improved resistance to rusting and corrosion, 
they involve the following problem: because of their
very thin resin layer(s), pinholes are formed, or the
resin layer is injured by a slight impact, so that a
metal portion is exposed to be rusted. Therefore, they
cannot be said to be stable to rusting and corrosion for
a long period of time.Moreover, they have been unusable as impact-resistant
boards, vibration-damping boards, acoustic
insulation materials, etc. because impacts, vibrations,
sounds, etc. from the outside are reflected on the metal
plate without absorption and reduction.In view of such conditions, the present
inventors earnestly investigated for solving such
problems and developing a multilayer laminate whose
metal plate is not rusted or attacked by exposure of a
metal portion due to a pinhole or a scratch and which are
utilized as an
vibration-damping board and acoustic insulation material.
Consequently, the present invention has been
accomplished.The present invention relates to the use of a multilayer
laminate as claimed in claim 1 which it is obtained by
laminating a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin layer
containing reinforcing fiber, on one or each side of a
metal plate. Fig. 1(A) shows an impact and vibration
equipment, and Fig. 1(B) shows an outline of a method
for measuring vibration and noise by means of said
equipment.Fig. 2 is a chart showing the results of
measuring the noise level of the multilayer laminate
obtained in Example 4.Fig. 3 is a chart showing the results of
measuring the noise level of a steel plate alone in
