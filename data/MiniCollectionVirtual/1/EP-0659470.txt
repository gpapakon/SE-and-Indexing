<ABSTRACT>
A transmission is disclosed for trucks (10) of the type 
having a wheeled chassis that is towed or independently 

powered and supports a substantially inverted frustum-shaped 
container (13) which is upwardly open and contains a scroll 

(14) with a vertical axis for shredding and mixing fibrous 
products. The transmission comprises a tracked-type 

epicyclic reduction unit (21) which is mounted on the bottom 
of the container (13) and supports the scroll (14) in a 

cantilevered manner. The reduction unit (21) is coupled to a 
hydraulic motor (20) connected to a pump (17), which is in 

turn coupled to a drive unit (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission for
combined shredding and mixing trucks for fibrous
zootechnical products.Mixing trucks are known in the zootechnical field that
are constituted by a wheeled chassis which is towed or self-propelled
with an independent power plant and supports a
substantially inverted frustum-shaped container, which is
open at the top and contains a scroll or helix with a
vertical axis for shredding and mixing fibrous products for
feeding livestock.The scroll, which has a substantially conical profile,
lies along a shaft which is rotatably coupled to the chassis
in a downward region and, in an upward region, to a cross-member
which is fixed between two opposite parts of the edge
of the container.A mechanical transmission with a reduction unit, i.e.,
a bevel gear pair and gear-based couplings, is currently
used to transmit the motion from the driving motor to the
scroll shaft.Although this type of transmission has been used
extensively so far, it has been found to have some drawbacks
which are mainly due to the considerable stresses to which
it is subjected.The presence of the gears produces overheating and
considerable load losses that require high motor power
levels.Another drawback is due to the fact that the upper
supporting cross-member of the shaft that supports the 
scroll creates an obstacle, when feeding large bales into
the container, and consequently creates considerable
problems in operation.An upstanding, projecting scroll is disclosed in the prior
document EP-A-0 393 583, while the document FR-A-2.107 226
discloses an epicyclic gearbox coupled to a reduction unit, for a
mixer truck.
However no solution is available in the prior art for
coupling the upstanding scroll of the first document with
the reduction unit-epicyclic gearbox arrangement of the second,
in a reliable and functional manner. An aim of the present invention is to provide a
transmission for combined shredding and mixing trucks for
fibrous zootechnical products that allows to overcome the
drawbacks described above in known types.A consequent primary object is to provide a
transmission that allows to mount the scroll in a
cantilevered manner, i.e. without the upper supporting
cross-member.Another important object is to minimize the dimensions
of the part of the transmission that is coupled to the
scroll shaft.Another important object is to facilitate and quicken
the assembly of the scroll.Yet another object is to provide a transmission which
has a lower cost than current ones.Another object is to
