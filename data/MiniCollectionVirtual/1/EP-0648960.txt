A method of determining a parameter which is associated with the initial 
engagement of a power-shift transmission clutch or brake, which serves to shift the 

transmission, wherein the power-shift transmission clutch or brake includes a clutch 
pack with at least two clutch elements (12, 14) arranged on a shaft (18) and which can 

be brought into engagement with one another by axial displacement relative to the shaft 

(18), as well as a hydraulically actuated piston (16) movable axially relative to the 
shaft (18), through which at least one clutch element (12) is axially movable in 

dependence on a clutch control pressure, wherein the parameter is altered in steps, so 
that the one clutch element (12) is brought stepwise into the engaged position with the 

other clutch element (14), characterized in that, with a power-shift transmission clutch 
or brake 


with a lubricant system with a lubricant source (26) and a lubricant channel (30) 
extending through the shaft (18) and which serves to transmit lubricant to the 

clutch pack (10), and 
with a lubricant opening (34) in the piston (16), wherein the lubricant opening 
(34) cooperates with the lubricant channel (30) in order to prevent a lubricant 

connection to the clutch pack (10) when the clutch elements (12) are uncoupled 
and in order to open a lubricant connection to the clutch pack (10) when the 

clutch elements (12, 14) engage, 
 
the following method steps are carried out: 


periodically detecting the pressure in the lubricant channel (30) and comparing 
the lubricant pressure with a reference pressure value and 
storing the current parameter value as a calibration value when the detected 
lubricant pressure is equal to the reference pressure value. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the parameter is the 
control pressure which corresponds to the initial application of the clutch elements (12, 

14).
