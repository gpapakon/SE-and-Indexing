<ABSTRACT>
A method for the placement of nodes in a net diagram, by assigning a 
level to each of the nodes in the diagram, determining with respect to 

each node at a reference level a positional relationship in a direction 
orthogonal to the level in dependence on connecting relationships with a 

set of nodes whose positional relationships have already been 
determined, wherein this last step involves the formation and matching 

of a bipartite graph.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
automatically determining placements of nodes in graph based diagrams (net diagrams) of technical systems including a logic
diagram, a process diagram, a relational tree diagram, and a
layout of a printed circuit board.For a conventional schematic generator,
various proposals have been presented. For example,
articles of such proposals have been described in the
JP-A-61-204775, "A Method of Generating a Logic Diagram"
in the Technical Report CAS84-134 published in 1984 from
the Institute or Electronics and Communication Engineers
of Japan, an article entitled "A Visibility Oriented Construction
System for LOGIC Diagrams", in SYSTEMS & COMPUTERS IN JAPAN,
VOL 17 No. 7, July 86, pages 40-48, T. Hasegawa et al.,
the JP-A-60-205672, and the JP-A-60-176177.In an ordinary schematic generator, an entire
logic circuit is subdivided through a logic division such
that for each subdivided portion, arrangement of diagram
drawing symbols of respective circuit parts and the like
are determined in the subdivided constituent circuit 
through an automatic placement or placement. Routings
between the circuit parts are determined through an
automatic routing. In another ordinary schematic
generator, the circuit parts are arranged so as to be
thereafter divided, thereby generating a logic circuit
diagram. These methods produces a clear diagram primarily
by subdividing a logic circuit diagram in an effective
fashion, by employing a hierarchic representation of the
logic circuit diagram, or by using properties of
particular circuit parts other than the connective
relationships between the circuit parts.Moreover, conventionally, according to a method
of arranging circuit parts of a logical circuit diagram in
the schematic generating method, locations in which
drawing symbols are allocatable are limited to positions
defined by assuming a checkerboard or grid on the
objective diagram. The placements are then sequentially
determined beginning from an end of the diagram in a fixed
direction (for example, from an output side to an input
side or in a reverse direction thereto) according to the
connective relationships between the drawings symbols
(namely, between the circuit parts). In a procedure to
decide the placements, each drawing symbols are assigned
with a level (namely, a column for placement or placement)
based on the connective relationships with an input
terminal (or an input port) or an output terminal (or an
output port) set as a start point or an initial point.

A node placement method for automatically determining
placements of all nodes in a graph based diagram representing a technical system, including


a first step (11) of assigning a level to each
node in said diagram;
a second step (12) of determining with respect
to each node at a reference level a positional

relationship in a direction orthogonal to a direction of
the level; and 
a third step (13) of determining with respect to
each node at each level a positional relationship in a

direction orthogonal to a direction of the respective
