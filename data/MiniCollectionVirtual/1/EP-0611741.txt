<ABSTRACT>
Separate preforms are produced for different parts of an article, made of composite material to be manufactured, and are assembled in an undensified or incompletely densified state, by bonding between the corresponding contact surfaces of the preforms (13, 15, 36) by means of fibrils (17, 19) which project perpendicularly to the surface of a preform (13, 15) and into which the surface of another preform (36) fits. The assembled preforms are then densified together. The fibrils are formed at the surface of a fibrous preform by the fibre ends of the latter which are displaced by needling the preform. The process is suitable in particular for the manufacture of a sandwich panel made of composite material comprising two rigid skins between which is arranged a core made of partitions which are perpendicular to the skins.

A method of fabricating a composite material part, the method 
comprising: 


making distinct preforms for different portions of the part; 
assembling the preforms together while they are in a non-densified state 
or a state that is not completely densified, with two preforms being assembled 

together at least in part by bonding the respective surfaces in contact of the two 
preforms by means of fibrils that project from the surface of at least one of the 

preforms and in which the surface of the other preform engages ; and 
co-densifying the assembled-together preforms; 
 
characterised in that, before assembling the preforms together, at least one of 

the fiber preforms is needled to a substrate which is subsequently separated 
from the preform to reveal the ends of the fibers of the preform that have been 

entrained into the substrate during needling, thereby forming the fibrils that 
project substantially perpendicularly from the surface of the preform. 
The method according to claim 1, characterised in that two preforms are 
assembled together at least in part by mutual engagement of their surfaces in 

contact by means of fibrils projecting from each of said surfaces. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 and 2, in which at least one 
of the preforms is made up of superposed two-directional fiber plies that are 

needled together, characterised in that at least one of the surface plies of said 
preform is peeled off to reveal the ends of the fibers that have been entrained 

into said ply during needling, thereby forming the fibrils. 
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the fibrils are made rigid by consolidating the preform that carries them by partial 

densification, prior to assembling the preforms together. 
The method of fabricating a sandwich panel of composite material, the 
panel comprising two rigid skins between which a core is disposed, the core 

being constituted by partitions extending perpendicularly to the skins, the method 
comprising: 


making distinct preforms for the skins and for the core of the panel; 
assembling together the preforms in a non-densified state or in a state 
that is not completely densified; and 
co-densifying the assembled-together preforms; 
 
characterised in that the fiber preform of a skin is needled to a substrate which 

substrate is subsequently separated from the preform to reveal the ends of the  
 

fibers of the preform that have been entrained into the substrate during needling, 
thereby forming the fibrils that project perpendicularly from the surface of the 

skin preform, and then the skin preforms and the core preform are assembled 
together at least in part by bonding their contacting surfaces together by means 

of the fibrils in which the ends of the partition preforms are engaged. 
The method according to claim 5, in which the preform of a skin is made 
up of superposed two-dimensional fiber plies that are needled together, 

characterised in that at least one of the surface plies of the preform is peeled off 
to reveal the ends of the fibers that have been entrained into said ply during 

needling, thereby forming the fibrils. 
The method according to any one of claims 5 and 6, characterised in that 
the fibrils are made rigid by consolidating the fiber preforms of the skins by 

partial densification before assembling them together with the core preform. 
The method according to claim 7, characterised in that the skin preforms 
provided with rigid fibrils are assembled together with a core preform constituted 

by a foam. 
The method according to any one of claims 5 to 8, characterised in that 
the skin preforms and core preform are additionally assembled together by 

bonding the assembly together on a shaper.
