<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical
composition containing a benzoxa condensed ring compound,
and more specifically, it relates to a pharmaceutical
composition containing a benzoxazole or 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran
compound, which is useful for
inhibiting the action of Acyl-Coenzyme A: Cholesterol
Acyltransferase (i.e., "ACAT" herein below).
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process
for producing the above-mentioned compound and a novel
compound belonging to the category of the above-mentioned
compound.As is well known in the art, atherosclerosis is a
very important factor causative of various cardiovascular
diseases, and extensive and intensive studies have been
conducted with a view to suppression of the progress of
atherosclerosis or regression of atherosclerosis. In
particular, the efficacy of a drug for lowering
cholesterol in the serum or arterial wall is recognized.
However, an ideal drug having a significant clinical
effect and less liable to occurrence of an adverse effect
has not been realized in the art.In recent years, it has become apparent that the
accumulation of a cholesterol ester in an arterial wall
is an important factor causative of the progress of
atherosclerosis. Therefore, a lowering in the
cholesterol level in the blood is useful for suppression
of the progress of atherosclerosis and regression of the
atherosclerosis. Cholesterol in foods is esterified in tunica mucosa
intestini tenuis and then incorporated as chylomicron in
the blood. It is known that ACAT plays an important role
in the formation of a cholesterol ester in the tunica
mucosa intestini tenuis or arterial wall. Therefore, it
is considered that the inhibition of ACAT in the tunica
mucosa intestini tenuis and the prevention of the
esterification can prevent the absorption of the
cholesterol, and the cholesterol level of the blood can
be lowered.In the arterial wall, the cholesterol is accumulated
as a cholesterol ester. Therefore, it is expected that
the inhibition of ACAT in the arterial wall can
effectively prevent the accumulation of the cholesterol
ester.Thus, an ACAT inhibitor is considered likely to
become a drug useful for treating hyperlipidemia and
atherosclerosis through the prevention of the cholesterol
in intestinum tenue and the accumulation of the
cholesterol in the arterial wall.For example, urea derivatives (see, for example, J.
Med. Chem., vol. 29, 1131 (1986) and Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 63-316761 and 1-93569)
and amide derivatives (see, for example,
