<ABSTRACT>
The present invention involves an adaptive digital radio communications architecture which can
be reconfigured by reprogramming at least one programmable device, and thus more efficiently use the

available bandwidth of a time-varying RF channel and/or to provide a flexible and adaptive digital
communications system. In certain embodiments, the programmable device uses a Programmable Logic

Device (PLD) to perform the digital communications processing functions of the transmitter or the receiver
of a radio communications system. In this context, PLD is a general term representing a family of

programmable logic devices; examples of this family are a Programmable Array Logic (PAL), a Complex
PLD (CPLD), and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The architecture is reconfigurable in the

sense that any or all of the digital communications processing algorithms can be modified by
reprogramming the PLD. The architecture of the digital communications system can be characterized by

the following parameters; the channel symbol rate, the occupied bandwidth, the modulation technique, and
the multiple access technique. A reconfiguration is a modification of the architecture of the digital

communications system, and can occur by reprogramming the PLD through external control, for example
in the event a radio communications base station wishes to change the radio architecture being used for a

particular piece of radio spectrum. A reconfiguration can also occur, for example, by dynamically
reprogramming the digital communications system depending upon time-varying radio channel conditions,

such as the effect of the number of channel users, the offered load, quality of service measurements, or the
characteristics of the desired application(s), including voice, data, video and/or tracking. Methods to

measure the time varying radio channel conditions are disclosed, and further how those measurements can

impact a reconfiguration. This invention discloses how the architecture for the digital communications
system can be dynamically reprogrammed based upon current channel conditions and/or through external

control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wireless communications systems and, more particularly, to a
wireless communications system using adaptive reconfigurable communication techniques.Wireless communication systems are used for a variety of applications, such as identification,
tracking, radar, data communications, voice communications, and video communications. In radio
frequency (RF) digital radio systems, a terminal unit communicates with other terminal units using
modulated radio signals. The terminal units include digital receivers which demodulate the incoming
digitally modulated RF carrier to reproduce the data message being transmitted.A software radio receiver system is a baseband receiver architecture and implementation in
which all of the baseband receiver functions are performed digitally, typically utilizing a digital signal
processor or a general purpose processor, in which the processor executes program instructions to
perform the baseband processing functions. As such, software radio takes the received radio signal,
typically after having been demodulated to an intermediate frequency (IF), and recovers the channel
symbol bits. Current software radio technology is limited in terms of the channel symbol rates which
can be digitally demodulated. A digital signal processor or general purpose processor is basically a
serial computational device, thus limiting the processor's computational speed. Thus, wideband
technology, such as code division multiple access (CDMA) systems with symbol rates near to or
exceeding one megasymbol per second cannot currently be practically implemented in a traditional
software radio approach. In summary, software radio techniques are limited due to the processing
capabilities; they can either support narrowband technology, or must be coupled with other techniques
in order to support wideband technology.Current technology also supports multiple mode terminals. For example, cellular telephony
supports dual or triple mode terminal units, where each mode communicates at a different frequency
and utilizing a different protocol mode. As an example, a cellular telephone could support the analog
advanced mobile phone system (AMPS) 30 kHz bandwidth air interface standard, and could also
support a time division multiple access (TDMA) air interface standard based upon having multiple
time slots within the same 30 kHz channel. However, in technology used to build dual-mode radio
communication systems, the protocol mode is determined at call set-up time, and remains fixed for
