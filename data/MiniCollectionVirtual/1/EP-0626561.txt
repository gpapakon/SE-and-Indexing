<ABSTRACT>
The compensator is used for an equipment which requires verticality or horizontality. The compensator comprises a sealed 
liquid container (4) in which transparent liquid is sealed in such a way that the liquid has a free surface (1); a light projecting system 

(5 and 6) for projecting a light beam to the free surface at a given angle, the beam being totally reflected at the free surface; 
and an optical system arranged in a required position in the optical path of the totally reflected light beam outside the sealed liquid 

container so that the variation of the reflection angle to the optical axis corresponding to the variation of the incident angle 
to the optical axis is equalized in all the directions. When the sealed liquid container is inclined and consequently the incident 

angle of the light beam to the free surface varies relatively, the sensitivity depending on the variation of the reflection angle is optically 
compensated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic tilt 
angle compensator for use for example in a surveying 
instrument, a measuring instrument or the like; 
preferably for measuring tilt changes or for maintaining 
an optical axis of the instrument in a vertical 
direction. When a surveying instrument, a measuring instrument 
or the like is used for surveying purposes, it is 
necessary to make compensation for the reference plane of 
the surveying or measuring instrument or to compensate 
for the verticality of an optical axis. In the past, compensation has automatically been 
performed as follows: a pendulum comprising a lens or a 
prism is suspended by two or three suspension lines. 
When a main unit of the surveying or measuring instrument 
is tilted, the pendulum is damped by a damping device 
such as a magnetic damping mechanism to automatically 
compensate the optical path. As one of the methods to detect tilting of a 
reference plane of a main unit of the surveying or 
measuring instrument, reflection on a free liquid surface 
may be utilized. In this method, a light beam is shone onto the free 
liquid surface, and the change of an optical axis of the 
reflected light is detected by a photodetector. When 
mercury is used as the liquid with the free liquid 
surface, and the light beam is shone perpendicularly onto 
the surface, it is possible to obtain a reflection angle 
having the same sensitivity to tilting of the liquid 
surface in all two-dimensional directions. Tilting of 
the reference plane in any direction can accordingly be 
detected.  
 However, liquids such as mercury are not very 
practical to use, either in terms of cost or of safety, 
and a transparent liquid such as silicone oil is used in 
practical application. When a transparent liquid is 
used, total reflection is utilized for the purpose. 
Because of the critical angle between liquid and air, in 
order to achieve total reflection of the light beam on 
the liquid surface, it is necessary to shine the light 
beam onto the free liquid surface at an incident angle Óúç 
which matches this critical angle. In a conventional-type 
detecting device utilizing a free liquid surface, 
the light beam is shone onto the free liquid surface at 
a predetermined angle. When a light beam is shone onto the free liquid 
surface at a predetermined angle, the change of 
reflection angle relating to different biaxial tilting 
directions with respect to the liquid surface is not 
uniform. Therefore, in such a device, measures must be 
taken to deal with
