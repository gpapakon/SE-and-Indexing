<ABSTRACT>
An EHT power supply, for example for a cathode ray tube, having a voltage multiplier of a multi-stage Cockroft-Walton type, in which the  capacitors of each stage are formed by layers of conducting material (13a, 13b) juxtaposed on either side of a layer (12) of dielectric material, the layers of dielectric material forming an integral part of the mechanical structure of the multiplier and physically supporting the rectifier diodes of the multiplier. In one embodiment of the invention, the multiplier is formed as a closely-spaced stack in which each stage comprises a separate layer (12) of dielectric material, and in another embodiment the capacitors of the AC side of the multiplier are formed on one layer (8) of material and the capacitors of the DC side of the multiplier are formed on another layer (9), the two layers being disposable on opposite sides of the neck (10) of a cathode ray tube with the successive stages being longitudinally disposed along the neck.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to EHT power supplies suitable, for example, 
though not exclusively, for cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and in 
particular for miniature CRTs. Another potential application is for 
insulation testers and the like, in which small size and low stored 
charge are an advantage. Such a power supply conventionally includes 
an oscillator, running at a frequency between, typically, 20kHz and 
50kHz, a step-up transformer and a multiplier. One known type of 
multiplier suitable for this application consists of several 
rectifier stages cascaded together. Such a circuit is known as a 
Cockroft-Walton multiplier. Examples of this type of multiplier are 
described in US-A-3 872 370 and GB-A-1 368 226. For CRT applications where the size and weight of the CRT and its 
associated power supplies are to be kept to a minimum, for example in 
the case of helmet-mounted CRT displays for use by aircrew, there is 
an advantage to be gained by miniaturising the power supply enabling 
it to be mounted around the neck of the CRT itself. To achieve this, 
it is necessary to raise the operating frequency of the oscillator to 
around 1MHz so that smaller components (particularly for the 
capacitors in the Cockroft-Walton multiplier) may be used. However, 
operating at such high frequencies incurs certain problems. In particular, the environment in which aircrew are likely to make 
use of miniature CRTs, such as in fast jet operations, is highly 
sensitive to radiation and it is imperative that accessibility to 
high-voltage lines be minimised for safety reasons. Moreover, high voltage ceramic capacitors normally used in Cockroft-Walton 
multipliers are too lossy when operating in this frequency 
region and polyester capacitors of standard design have marginal 
performance with regard to their voltage rating. This invention aims to overcome these problems by utilising a low 
output impedance power supply feeding the immediate power supply for 
the CRT which consists of a step-up transformer comprising a 
multiplier of the Cockroft-Walton type having reduced size and weight 
and capable of operating without significant losses at frequencies of 
around 1MHz or more, and whose capacitors are formed on an integral 
part of its mechanical structure. The step-up transformer may then 
be mounted on the helmet of the aircrew on or in close proximity to 
the CRT whilst being connected to a remote low voltage power supply. Accordingly, this invention consists of an EHT power supply for a  
 
cathode ray tube consisting of

An EHT power supply for a cathode ray tube consisting of an 
oscillator (1), a power amplifier (2) and a step-up transformer (4) 

connected to the input of a voltage multiplier of a multi-stage 
Cockroft-Walton type operable at a frequency of at least 1MHz,

core driver circuit connected to the step-up transformer

areas of conducting material (13a, 13b) juxtaposed on either side of

stage of the multiplier comprising a separate layer (12) of 
dielectric material and consisting of two capacitors (13a, 13b) and 

two diodes (14a, 14b), one diode (14a) being connected between 
terminals of the two capacitors of the stage on the same side of the 

layer and the other diode (14b) being connected between terminals of 
the two capacitors on opposite sides of the layer. 
An EHT power supply as claimed in Claim 2 further characterised 
in that successive stages of the multiplier are interconnected by 

electrical contacts made between adjacent terminals of corresponding

dielectric material, said two layers being disposable along opposite 
sides of the neck (10) of the CRT with successive stages of the 

multiplier being disposable generally longitudinally to one another
