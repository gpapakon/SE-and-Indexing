<ABSTRACT>
Retaining device for a roof guard wall, comprising guard-wall retaining means (1) which can be fitted on roof rafters and have wall-post retaining means (4,31) arranged at an angle at one end. In said retaining device, the guard-wall retaining means (1) exhibits, on its upper side, a plate (7,35) with a transverse bore (8,35a) for freely rotatably receiving a fastening bolt (9) and, at the end remote from the wall-post retaining means, a stop (11,36) which projects beyond the guard-wall retaining means on one side. In this arrangement, the distance from the plate (7,35) to the stop (11,36) is smaller than the distance from the plate (7,35) to the wall-post retaining means (4,31). The wall-post retaining means (4,31) is advantageously defined as a tube portion, with the result that a wall post (5) can be plugged in. Furthermore, the wall-post retaining means (31) is arranged pivotably and arrestably on the guard-wall retaining means (1).
