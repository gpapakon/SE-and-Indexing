<ABSTRACT>
In a method of producing a condenser lens substrate (9), 
after a first clear substrate (1) and a second clear substrate (4') 

where a micro-lens (2) having a spherical surface or a 
lenticular lens is formed are stuck to each other, at 

least one of the clear substrates is ground. At this 
time, the clear substrate (4') is ground so as to have a 

thickness that a focus of the micro-lens or the lenticular 
lens is positioned in the vicinity of the outer surface of 

the first or the second clear substrate. This makes it 
possible to form a micro-lens or a lenticular lens having 

a short focus in a substrate of a liquid crystal display 
element. As a result, when a condenser lens substrate (9) is 

produced, a possibility of breakage of the clear substrate 
is eliminated, and handling and sticking of clear 

substrates become easy, thereby making it possible to 
improve mass-productivity of a condenser lens substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing a condenser lens substrate which is used for
high-precision liquid crystal display element, etc.Recently, demand for a liquid crystal panel has
gotten higher not only for the direct-view type but also
for projection type display elements such as projection TVs. In
the case where a liquid crystal display panel is used as
the projection type, display element, as an enlargement
ratio is raised while using a constant number of picture
elements, roughness of a picture becomes more noticeable.
In order to obtain a precise image even at a high 
magnification, it is necessary to increase the number of
picture elements.However, if the number of picture elements of a liquid
crystal panel is increased, especially in an active matrix
type liquid crystal, an area of parts other than picture
elements becomes relatively large, and an area of a black
matrix which covers the above portion is increased. As a
result, an area of the picture element which contributes
to display is decreased, so an aperture ratio of the
display element drops. If a drop in the aperture ratio
occurs, a picture becomes dark, thereby deteriorating
quality of an image.In order to prevent such a drop in an aperture ratio
due to increase in a number of picture elements, Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publications No. 60-165621, 165622,
165623, 165624, 262131/1985 (Tokukaisho 60-165621, 165622,
165623, 165624, 262131) disclose that a micro-lens array is
formed on one surface of a liquid crystal panel, for
example. The micro-lens array shown here has micro-lenses
corresponding to each picture element and condenses a
light, which is conventionally blocked off by a black
matrix into picture elements.In addition to the above application, the
micro-lenses are used in combination with the following 
means:
(1) condensing means of an optical pick-up, such as a
laser disk, compact disk, magneto-optical disk;(2) condensing means for combining an optical fiber
with a light emitting element or a light receiving
element;(3) condensing means or image forming means for
condensing an incident light to a photoelectric converting
area so as to improve sensitivity of a solid image pickup
element such as a CCD, or a one-dimensional image sensor
which is used for a facsimile (for example, Japanese

A method of producing a condenser lens substrate,
comprising:


a first step of forming a condenser lens having a
curved surface on a first transparent substrate;
a second step of adhering the first transparent substrate
