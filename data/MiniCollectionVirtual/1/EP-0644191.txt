<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel pyridine compound 
having antiulcer activity, gastrointestinal cytoprotective 
activity, ulcer recurrence or relapse-preventive activity, 
gastric acid secretion-suppressive activity and/or antibacterial 
activity against Helicobacter pylori, and a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof. Of the compounds recently developed as antiulcer 
preparations, 5-methoxy-2-[((4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridyl)methyl)sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole 
(generally called omeprazole) 
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 34956/1985 has 
been acknowledged of its clinical utility. Thereafter, a number of compounds have been reported and 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 181277/1984, 
6270/1989, 79177/1989 and International Publication No. 
WO89/00566 disclose compounds having gastric acid secretion-suppressive 
activity and useful as antiulcer drugs. In 
addition, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 
48680/1991, 52887/1991, 173817/1991 and International 
Publication No. WO92/12976 disclose a series of compounds 
having antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori (old 
name: Campylobacter pylori). While the treatment of patients with peptic ulcer has been  
 
making rapid progress ever since a gastric acid secretion 
suppressor was developed, problems of recurrence and relapse of 
ulcer have also arisen. For example, the percent relapse in 12 
months after the treatment with an H₂ antagonist is reportedly 
very high and is 70-90%. A high percentage in the detection of Helicobacter pylori 
in the patients with gastritis or peptic ulcer suggests 
involvement of Helicobacter pylori in gastritis and peptic 
ulcer [D.Y. Graham, Gastroenterology, 96, p. 615 (1989)]. 
Also, reports with regard to decreased recurrence and relapse 
ratio of ulcer by the eradication of Helicobacter pylori are 
increasing in number [The Lancet, 336, p. 755 (1990), ibid, 
337, p. 1614 (1991)]. For the eradication of Helicobacter pylori, antibiotics 
and bismuth preparations have been used. Antibiotics, however, 
exert influences on other bacteria as well and a long-term use 
of them is not desirable. On the other hand, bismuth 
preparations have low potency and cause side effects such as 
vomiting, diarrhea and central side effects. Accordingly, the treatment of bacterial infections with 
Helicobacter pylori requires selective and highly antibacterial 
drugs. For the prevention of recurrence and relapse of ulcer, a 
novel pharmaceutical preparation having, besides these
