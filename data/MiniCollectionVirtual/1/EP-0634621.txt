<ABSTRACT>
Firing mechanism for firearms, this mechanism comprising a hammer (5) pivoting between a "cocked" position and a "dropped" position in contact with the striker (4), a sear (8) capable of retaining the hammer (5) in the cocked position, an actual trigger (13) controlling the sear (8), means (20) for causing the hammer (5) to pivot from its cocked position towards the striker (4) of the firearm when this hammer (5) is released by the sear (8), and a safety device comprising a manually engageable locking element (27) capable of blocking the trigger (13), characterised in that, in the safety position, the locking element (27) cooperates not only with the trigger (13), but simultaneously with the means (20) for causing this hammer to pivot, in order to prevent the hammer (5) from knocking against the striker (4) as long as the locking element (27) is in its abovementioned position.

Firing mechanism for fire arms, comprising a hammer
(5) pivoting between a "cocked" position and a "tumbled"

position in contact with the striker (4), a tumbler (8)
which can retain the hammer (5) in the cocked postion, an

actual trigger (13) which controls the tumbler (8), means
(20) for having the hammer (5) pivoted from its cocked

position towards the striker (4) of the weapon when the
hammer (5) is released by the tumbler (8), and a safety

device containing a locking element (27) which can be
locked manually and which can block the trigger (13) and

the cocked hammer (5), characterized in that the locking
element (27), in safety position, not only cooperates

with the trigger (13), but simultaneously with the means
(20) for pivoting this hammer (5), whereby these means

comprise an actuation element (21), one extremity of
which is fixed pivotable to the hammer (5) at a distance

to its pivoting axis (6), whereby this actuation element
(21) is provided with a part (26) which is retained by a

part (29) of the locking element (27) when this latter is
in safety position and the hammer (5) is cocked, whereby

the locking element (27), in safety position as well as
in firing position, during cocking of the hammer (5),

allows the transition of the above-said part (26) of the
actuation element (21) into its position in which it is

retained by the locking element (27), whereby the part
(26) of the actuation element (21) does not prevent the

transition of this locking element (27) from its firing
position into its safety position and reverse, while it

is retained by the locking element (27).
Mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in that
the locking element (27) is movable in a direction

parallel to the pivoting axis (6) of the hammer (5) and 
comprises a part (28) which, in safety position,

cooperates with the trigger (13), and another part (29)
cooperating in the same position with the means (20) for

pivoting the hammer (5).
Mechanism according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the actuation element (21) of the means (20) for

pivoting the hammer (5) is a rod, whereby these means
(20), amongst others, comprise a pushing element (23)

pushing upon the extremity of the rod (21) which is
located away from the hammer (5).
Mechanism according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the portion (26) of the actuation

element (21) cooperating with the locking element (27) is
a hook.
Mechanism according to claims 3 and 4, characterized
in that the part (29) of the locking element (27)

cooperating with the hook (26) of the rod (21) has such a
shape that, when the hook (26) is engaged by this part,

it is impossible to move the locking element (27) out of
the safety position.
Mechanism according to any of the claims 4 and 5,
characterized in that the part (29) of the locking

element (27) cooperating with the hook (26) of the rod
(21), comprises a part in the shape of a detent portion

in which the hook (26) can engage.
Mechanism according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the part (28) of the locking

element (27) cooperating with the trigger (13) has a
triangular or similar cross-section.
Mechanism according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the trigger (13) actuates the

tumbler (8) by means of a separating lever (15) fixed
with one end in a pivotable manner to the trigger (13)

and with its other end coming into contact with an
extremity of the tumbler (8) in the active position in

which it retains the hammer (5), whereby the movement of
the separating lever (15), following the movement of the

trigger (13), causes the tumbler (8) to pivot against a
spring (10) into a position in which it releases the

hammer (5).
