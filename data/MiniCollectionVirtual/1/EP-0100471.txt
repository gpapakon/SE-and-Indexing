ALPHA TOCOPHEROL PROCESS
This invention relates to an improved process for manufacturing   d,1-alpha-tocopherol.   


The preparation of d,1-alpha-tocopherol by the condensation -of trimethylhydroquinone and a phytyl derivative in the presence of an inert solvent and acid condensing agents is well known in the art. The acid catalyst can be either or both a Lewis acid such as zinc chloride or a strong inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, sodium bisulfate or para-toluenesulfonic acid. In addition, it is known from U.S. 4,191,692 to pre-react isophytol with a small amount of ammonia or an amine prior to reaction with trimethylhydroquinone.


The use of zinc chloride, an inert solvent and gaseous hydrochloric acid in the process of producing d,1-alpha -tocopherol is disclosed by Karrer in U.S. 2,411,967;   U.S.    2,411,968; and U.S. 2,411,969. Greenbaum et al in   U.S.    3,708,505 also disclose the use of a combination of a
Lewis acid and a strong acid in a process for the preparation of d,1-alpha-tocopherol.


Improved process catalysts or combinations thereof are also disclosed in U.S. 4,208,334; 2,723,278; 3,789,086; 3,459,773; 3,444,213; and 4,217,285.


It has been unexpectedly discovered that by including a small amount of an amine salt of a non-oxidizing protic acid or a amine thus forming in situ the amine salt, in the reaction mixture for the preparation of d,1-alpha -tocopherol that an improved product is obtained, specifically a product having greater purity. Additionally, the percent yield is also increased. In the process of the  invention, trimethylhydroquinone and an inert organic solvent are charged into a reaction vessel together with a combination of at least one Lewis acid, at least one strong acid, and at least one of said amine or amine salt.


A phytyl derivative such as isophytol is then slowly added to the reaction mixture and when addition has been completed, the reaction mass is refluxed for a sufficient time to produce d,l-alpha-tocopherol. Optionally, acetic anhydride can be added to produce d,l-alpha-tocopherol acetate. It is a particular advantage of the present process that the synthesis is essentially a one-step process which produces a higher yield as well as a higher quality d,1-alpha-tocopherol.


The phytyl derivative useful as a reactant in the process of the invention has the formulas:
EMI2.1     
 wherein X is a leaving group. Useful leaving groups include hydroxy, halogen, lower alkylsulfonyloxy, arylsulfonyloxy, lower alkoxy, and lower alkanoyloxy. The
