<ABSTRACT>
A hydrophilic coating with improved retention of water on a surface, especially a surface of a medical device such as a urethra catheter, prepared by applying on to the surface in one or more process steps at least one solution of components that will combine to form the hydrophilic coating. During the final process step, the surface is coated with an osmolality promoting agent, which is dissolved or emulgated in the solution or in the last solution to be applied, forming the hydrophilic coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing a
hydrophilic coating as described in the introductory part
of claim 1.It is known to coat medical devices, e.g., catheters
for introduction into human cavities such as blood vessels,
digestive organs and the urinary system, with a hydrophilic
coating, as a minimum applied on that part of the surface
which gets into contact with the mucous membranes, etc.,
during introduction of the device. Whereas such coating in
dry condition is not particularly smooth, so that the
handling of the device does not become inconvenient, when
it is moistened with water immediately before introduction
into the human body it becomes extremely slippery, thereby
providing a substantially painless introduction.A large number of methods are known for the production
of hydrophilic surface coatings.These methods are mainly based on the fact that the
substrate to be provided with a hydrophilic surface
coating, in the course of one or more process stages with
intermediary drying and curing, is coated with one or more
(mostly two) layers, which are caused to react with one
another in different ways, e.g., by polymerization
initiated by irradiation, by graft polymerization, by the
formation of interpolymeric network structures, or by
direct chemical reactions. Regarding this subject, please
refer to DK-A-900 855, DK-B-159 018, EP-A-379 156, EP-A-454
293, EP-B2-93 093, GB-A-1 600 963, US-A-4 119 094, US-A-4
373 009, US-A-4 729 914, US-A-5 041 100, and US-A-5
120 816, and to WO-A-9005162 and WO-A-9119756.According to a method known from' US-A-5 001 009, a
hydrophilic surface coating is prepared on a substrate by
applying, in two stages or in one combined stage, on the
substrate a reactive or an adhesive primer layer and then
the actual hydrophilic surface layer, which in this case 
comprises polyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP] as the active constituent.
By this method, there is no chemical reaction
between the components of the two layers applied.Where a device of said type, e.g., a catheter, is to
remain inside the body only for a short period, there may
be a risk that water will be extracted from the hydrophilic
surface coating and into the body fluids in the surrounding
mucous membranes etc., owing to the higher osmotic
potential of said body fluids. As a result of the
extraction of water, the hydrophilic surface coating will
have a tendency to stick to the surrounding tissues, and
the removal of the medical device from the body may be
painful.EP-B-217 771 describes a method of said type for
