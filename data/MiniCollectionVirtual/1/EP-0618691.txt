<ABSTRACT>
This device for evaluation of the transmission quality of an optical amplifier includes:   - means (5) for picking off, upstream of the said amplifier equipment, with respect to the direction of propagation of the optical signal to be amplified by this amplifier equipment, a part of the power of an optical signal propagating in the opposite direction to the said direction of propagation, and corresponding to the part, sent in the opposite direction to the said direction of propagation, of the noise created by the said amplifier equipment, - means (6) for picking off, downstream of the said amplifier equipment, a part of the power of an optical signal propagating in the said direction of propagation, and corresponding to the superimposition of the optical signal amplified by the said amplifier equipment and of the part, sent in the said direction of propagation, of the noise created by this amplifier equipment, - means (8) for evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio of the said amplifier equipment, from the optical powers thus picked off.

<CLAIMS>
Device for assessing the transmission quality of an optical amplifier equipment
(1), comprising:


means (5) for sampling on the upstream side of said amplifier equipment
relative to the direction of propagation of the optical signal to be amplified by

said amplifier equipment part of the power of an optical signal propagating in
the direction opposite to said propagation direction and corresponding to that

part of the noise generated by said amplifier equipment transmitted in the
direction opposite to said propagation direction,
means (6) for sampling on the downstream side of said amplifier equipment
relative to said propagation direction part of the power of an optical signal

propagating in said propagation direction and corresponding to the optical
signal after amplification by said amplifier equipment superimposed on that part

of the noise generated by said amplifier equipment transmitted in said
propagation direction, and
means (8) for assessing the signal-to-noise ratio of said amplifier equipment
from the optical powers sampled as above.
Device according to claim 1 wherein said means for assessing the signal-to-noise
ratio allow for characteristics (C) inherent to said amplifier equipment and

enabling a relationship to be established between said parts of the noise
generated by said amplifier equipment transmitted in said propagation direction

and in the direction opposite to said propagation direction.
Device according to claim 1 wherein said means for assessing the signal-to-noise
ratio include:


means (10, 11, 12, 13) for converting into electrical signals the optical signals
from said sampling means, and
means (14) for assessing the signal-to-noise ratio operating on the resulting
electrical signals.
