<ABSTRACT>
Process for the treatment of tanned or non-tanned products comprising skins, leathers or other collagen-containing sheet materials, at different stages in their transformation. According to the process, the products are placed in contact at (1) with a pressurized dense fluid, for example pressurized CO2 in a supercritical or liquid state, which optionally contains one or more active substances and is brought to a pressure Pi at (5) and to a temperature Ti at (7), either for the removal of grease from said products if pure fluid is used, or for their impregnation with active substances such as tanning, reinforcing, dyeing or water-repellent agents. After impregnation or degreasing, the products are brought to ambient pressure for removal of the dense fluid. The process can be carried out at several stages in the transformation of skins into leathers or other sheet materials, fluid pressure and temperature characteristics being adapted to the purpose of the invention.

Process for the degreasing of skins with a view to their 
transformation into leather, characterized in that it comprises the following stages: 


a) contacting the skins with a dense fluid able to dissolve grease, 
under a pressure Pi and a temperature Ti, the pressure Pi being at least equal to the 

critical pressure Pc of the fluid and the temperature Ti being such that the fluid has an 
adequate density for ensuring the partial solubilization of the grease and 
b) returning the skins to atmospheric pressure in order to eliminate the 
dense fluid in gaseous form. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that in stage a), there 
is a continuous circulation of the dense fluid at the pressure Pi and the temperature Ti 

in a treatment enclosure containing the skins, the dense fluid is purified on leaving the 
treatment enclosure in order to separate therefrom the dissolved substances and the 

purified, dense fluid is recycled to the enclosure entrance. 
Process for the treatment of products constituted by skins, hides or 
sheet materials containing collagen with a view to their transformation into leather or 

their finishing, characterized in that it comprises the following stages: 

a) contacting the skins, hides or sheet materials with a dense fluid 
containing at least one active substance for the transformation or finishing of the 

skins, hides or sheet materials, under a pressure Pi at least equal to the critical 
pressure Pc of the fluid and at a temperature Ti such that the fluid has an adequate 

density for impregnating the skins, hides or sheet materials with the active substance 
or substances and 
b) returning the skins, hides or sheet materials to atmospheric 
pressure in order to eliminate the dense fluid in gaseous form. 
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that in stage a), there 
is a continuous circulation of the dense fluid containing the active substance or 

substances at the pressure Pi and the temperature Ti in a treatment enclosure 
containing the skins, hides or sheet materials, the dense fluid is treated on leaving the 

treatment enclosure in order to readjust to the desired value its active substance 
content and the thus treated, dense fluid is recycled to the treatment enclosure. 
Process according to either of the claims 3 and 4, characterized in 
that it also comprises a complementary rinsing stage of the skins, hides or sheet 

materials by means of a pure dense fluid, performed before stage a) and/or before 
stage b).  

 
Process according to either of the claims 2 and 4, characterized in 
that in stage b), the circulation of the dense, pressurized fluid is interrupted and the 

enclosure returned to atmospheric pressure. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that the dense fluid is chosen from among carbon dioxide, sulphur hexafluoride, 

nitrous oxide, ammonia and light alkanes. 
Process according to claim 7, characterized in that the dense fluid 
is carbon dioxide. 
Process according to either of the claims 7 and 8, characterized in 
that the dense fluid is in the supercritical state. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that the dense fluid also comprises an additive for modifying the solvent or 

dehydrating power of the dense fluid, or for facilitating the dissolving or transfer of 
the active substance or substances into the dense fluid. 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in that the additive is 
constituted by water or an alcohol. 
Process according to any one of the claims 3 to 11, characterized 
in that the active substance is chosen from among tannin agents, reinforcing agents, 

dyeing agents, waterproofing agents and precursors of said agents. 
Process according to any one of the claims 3 to 12, characterized 
in that the active substance reacts with the products to be treated. 
Process according to any one of the claims 3 to 12, characterized 
in that the active substance is such that it can be transformed by an appropriate 

treatment into a form retained by the products to be treated. 
Process according to claim 14, characterized in that the treatment 

is a chemical, physicochemical, photochemical, irradiation or thermal treatment. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that during the contacting of the products to be treated with the dense fluid, the 

pressure of the dense fluid is periodically varied by ΔP around Pi. 
Process according to claim 16, characterized in that the pressure 
variation ΔP represents 10% of Pi. 
Process according to either of the claims 1 and 3, characterized in 
that the pressure Pi is from 6 to 50 mPa and the temperature Ti from 10 to 300°C. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1, 3 and 18, 
characterized in that the pressure Pi and the temperature Ti are chosen so as to adjust 

the solvent power with respect to grease or the dissolving capacity of the active 
substance or substances by the dense fluid to the desired value.  

 
Process according to either of the claims 3 and 12, characterized in

polyethylene glycols and/or polytetraethylene (or methylene) glycols.
