<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for closing the stirrer lids of paint containers on mixing machines. This device, of the type known as the cam type, comprising a series of lower tabs (1) which are rotatably mounted on the lid (3) and positioned evenly around its circumference, each of which is actuated at the top by an operating lever (9) so as to bear, during use, on the underside of the rim (11) for opening the container in question (13), by means of a rod shank (5) which connects the tab (1) to the operating lever (9) and is mounted so that it can slide and rotate freely in a suitable bearing (7) formed on the body of the lid, is characterised in that a flexible elastic tube (15) or bearing bush is mounted with limited play around the rod shank (5) of each of the tabs (1), this tube being inserted between the operating lever (9) and the top of the bearing (7).

A closure device for a stirring cover of paint cans on paint 
stirring machines, of the type referred to as a cam device, comprising a 

series of lower lugs (1) mounted rotatably on the cover (3) and regularly 
disposed at its periphery and each actuated at the upper level by an 

operating lever (9) to come to bear in the operative condition under the 
opening rim (11) of the can (13) being treated, by means of a spindle (5) 

connecting the lug (1) to the operating lever (9) and mounted for sliding 
and rotational movement on a suitable bearing (7) formed on the body of 

the cover, characterised in that an elastic flexible tube (15) or pad is 
mounted with a slight clearance around the spindle (5) of each of the lugs 

(1), said tube being interposed between the operating lever (9) and the 
upper end of the bearing (7). 
A closure device according to claim 1 characterised in that said 
tube (15) is of elastomer material and has longitudinal elasticity which, 

by compression between the operating lever and the upper end of the 
bearing, provides for compensation for application under pressure of the 

lug against the rim of the can upon closure thereof by operation of the 
rotatable lever. 
A closure device according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised 
in that said tube (15) is also applied in its lower pert against a 

complementary flange (19) formed at the upper end of the bearing (7) so 
that, when it is compressed in the operative condition, it is sealingly 

applied against said bearing. 
A closure device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said tube (15) is mounted with a clearance of one to 

several tenths of a millimetre around the spindle (5) of the lug (1).  
 
A closure device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said tube (15) is enclosed with a lateral spacing in 

a cylindrical skirt (17) formed in the body of the lever (9). 
A closure device according to claim 5 characterised in that said 
tube (15) is applied by means of its top end in simple contact against the 

bottom (21) of the skirt (17) of the lever (9). 
A closure device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the length of the tube (15) is so determined that in 

the rest position the lug (1) is disposed substantially at the level of 
the edge (23) of the cover and that in the course of rotation of the lever 

(9) when the cover is fitted in the closure condition on to the can it can 
be compressed to apply the lug (1) at the level of the rim (11) of the 

can, namely at a position which is lower by one to several millimetres 
relative to the rest position. 
A stirring cover for paint cans on stirring machines 
characterised in that it comprises a closure device as defined in any one 

of the preceding claims.
