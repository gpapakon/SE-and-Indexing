<DESCRIPTION>
 ROUND BALER HAVING -AN I-WRAPPING CORE STARTERTechnical FieldThis invention relates to round balers and, more particularly, to mechanism for achieving more reliable starting of a bale core during each baling cycle while minimizing the tendency of crop materials to plug the machine and wrap around rotating components. Background In a variable volume or expandable chamber baler, the baling operation can proceed relatively smoothly once the initial start up phase has passed and it is only necessary for the bale core to continue wrapping itself with additional layers of material as such materials are picked up and introduced into the baling chamber. The start up or core forming stage, however, can be trouble¬ some, depending upon crop conditions, including the nature of the crop being baled and its moisture content. In some instances, the fresh crop material may not tumble properly within the empty chamber and may thus fail to form the coiled up core in the desired manner; in other instances, the crop material may plug up the infeed region of the baler and/or become wrapped around rotating parts so completely that the operation must be halted and the troublesome materials cleaned out of the machine.It has been a common practice for many years to utilize a rotating starter roller within the infeed region of the baler to help give the newly arriving materials an extra measure of rotational driving force, thus encouraging them to tumble and coil up in the desired manner for starting the core. However, the presence of the starter roller within the infeed region presents one additional moving part on which stringy, especially high-moisture materials can become wrapped and plugged. 

 ---Mmmi-i y of the InventionAccordingly, it is an important object of the present invention is to provide improvements in the infeed region of a rotary baler which retain the benefits of a bale starter roller without its drawbacks. In the process, it is an important object of the present invention to provide an improved baler having more reliable starting characteristics in a wider variety of crop conditions and types than has heretofore been possible.In carrying out the foregoing, the present invention contemplates providing the starter roller with a moving, essentially flat surface at the top of the roller where contact is normally made with the bale core so that, instead of having a complete cylindrical surface around which the loose crop materials can wrap, the materials are instead confronted with a platform-like surface that

CLAIHS
1. In a round baler having a crop infeed region and means for forming a bale core adjacent said region at the commencement of each bale forming cycle, said region having crop infeed mechanism at a lower extremity thereof and a transverse roll spaced generally above said mechanism, the improvement comprising: an elongated conveyor projecting into said region above said inf ed mechanism and below said roll for assisting in the formation of each bale core, said conveyor including a first transverse roller positioned to impart a rotary driving force to the core as crop material is coiled into a bale, said conveyor further including a second transverse roller spaced outwardly from said first roller in a direction away from said core forming means, an endless web entrained around said rollers, and means for driving the web in such a direction that an upper stretch thereof moves inwardly toward the first roller from the second roller.
2. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 1, said bale core forming means including means presenting an upwardly moving surface spaced inwardly from an inner end of said conveyor defined by said first transverse roller, and a downwardly moving surface located above said conveyor and directed toward said upper stretch of the conveyor web, said upwardly moving surface and said downwardly moving surface being adapted to impart a tumbling action to crop material being formed into a bale core. 


 3. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 2, said upwardly moving surface being presented by a first flexible belt run.
*
5 4. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 3, said downwardly moving surface being presented by a second flexible belt run.
5. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 4, 10 said first and second belt runs comprising different portions of a single set of endless belts.
6. In a round baler as claimed in Claim l, said infeed mechanism including a crop pickup for
15 lifting crop materials off the ground and feeding the same upwardly and rearwardly as the baler advances, said bale core forming means including a lower transverse guide roll rearwardly adjacent said
20 pickup and an upwardly moving stretch of a plurality of side-by-side, flexible belts looped under said lower roll and extending upwardly therefrom for receiving crop materials from the pickup and imparting a lifting and
25 coiling action thereto, said first roller of the conveyor being located above the pickup and spaced forwardly from said upwardly moving stretch of the flexible belts.
30 7. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 1, said web of the conveyor being comprised of a plurality of endless, side-by-side, flexible belts.
35 


 8. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 7, each of said belts having a series of transverse slats thereon.
9. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 1, said web having a lower stretch that moves outwardly away from the first roller toward the second roller, there being a shield between said lower stretch of the conveyor web and the crop infeed mechanism for preventing engagement of the infeeding crop with the lower stretch of the conveyor web.
10. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 1, said core forming means including endless flexible belts having portions looped under said transverse roll above the infeed mechanism and presenting a zone above the transverse roll in which stray crop materials may accumulate, said conveyor projecting outwardly beyond said transverse roll for such a distance that said upper stretch of the conveyor web may catch stray crop materials gravitating from said zone above the transverse roll and deliver the stray material to the forming bale core. 

11. In a round baler, the improvement comprising: means defining an expandable baling chamber including a plurality of transverse, parallel guide rolls and side-by-side lengths of endless, flexible belts looped around said guide rolls, said baling chamber at the beginning of a baling cycle including a generally upwardly moving rear run of the belts and a generally down¬ wardly moving front run of the belts for imparting a forward tumbling and coiling action to crop materials introduced into the baling chamber to produce a bale core, said front run of the belts being looped under a front one of said transverse guide rolls and said rear run of the belts being looped under a rear one of said transverse guide rolls, said front guide roll being spaced upwardly and forwardly from said rear guide roll to present an open infeed region between the front and rear rolls for accepting crop materials into the baling chamber; a pickup forwardly adjacent said rear guide roll in position for lifting crop materials off the ground as the baler is advanced and feeding the materials through the infeed region into the baling chamber; a transverse starter roller within said infeed region forwardly of said rear belt run and rearwardly of and below said front guide roll for assisting in the formation of a bale core within the chamber. 


 said starter roller being rotatable in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the core as it is formed within the baling chamber; and means defining a generally planar surface in generally tangential relationship with an upper extremity of the starter roller and extending forwardly therefrom beneath the front guide roll, said generally planar surface being movable toward the baling chamber for preventing wrapping of the starting roller with crop materials during formation of the bale core.
12. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 11, said .planar surface defining means including -an upper stretch of an endless web forming a part of a conveyor assembly, said web being looped around said starter roller at - an inner, rear end of the conveyor assembly and around a second transverse roller at an outer, forward end of the conveyor assembly.
13. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 12, said endless web comprising a series of endless belts disposed in side-by-side relationship on said starter roller and said second transverse roller. 


 14. In a round baler as claimed in Claim 12, said conveyor assembly having a lower belt stretch moving from the starter roller toward said second transverse roller, there being a shield beneath the lower belt stretch for preventing engagement of infeeding crop materials with the lower stretch of the conveyor assembly.
