<ABSTRACT>
An adjustment button (50) for altering the orientation, in particular of a headlight mirror, comprises a mounting part, with the possibility of rotation about an axis, on a fixed region and a manoeuvring part which can be accessed with the fingers or with a tool. According to the invention, the mounting part comprises a shaft having an internally tapped cavity for receiving a non-rotating threaded rod (150) which is connected to the mirror, the said shaft defining, in a free end region opposite the said manoeuvring part, at least two flexible teeth for attachment onto an inner end edge of a sleeve (11) formed in the said fixed region of the vehicle for permanent mounting of the said button by introducing the said shaft into the said sleeve so as to prevent translation of the button, and the said mounting and manoeuvring parts are formed in a single piece.

An adjustment knob for altering the orientation of a
moveable portion such as a mirror (20) of an automotive

vehicle headlamp, of the type comprising a mounting
portion (51, 52), with the possibility of rotation around

an axis, on a fixed region of the vehicle such as the
housing (10) of the headlamp, and a control portion (57,

58) accessible to the fingers of an operator or to a
tool,
characterised in that
 the mounting portion comprises a
shaft (51) having a cavity (54) threaded internally (55)

to receive a non-rotating threaded rod (150) connected to
the mirror, the said shaft defining in a free end region

opposite the said control portion at least two flexible
teeth (52) for hooking onto an interior end edge of a

sleeve (11) formed in the said fixed region of the
vehicle for the non-detachable mounting of the said knob

by the introduction of the said shaft into the said
sleeve so as to avoid the translational movement of the

knob,
and in that
 the said mounting and control portions are
formed in a single piece.
An adjustment knob according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 it comprises two hooking teeth (52)
separated from one another by two notches (53) formed in

diametrically opposite regions of the shaft from its free
end.
An adjustment knob according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 provided in the control portion is
a partition (59a) for sealing the threaded cavity (54) of

the shaft. 
An adjustment knob according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 it comprises, in an intermediate
region (56) between the control portion and the mounting

portion, a shoulder (56a) for the support of a resilient
seal (70) for tightness and clearance compensation.
An adjustment knob according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the control portion comprises a
generally discoidal portion (57) essentially concentric

with the axis of rotation of the knob, this discoidal
portion having, on a face turned towards the said

mounting portion, an annular cavity (68), and on the
opposite face, a generally convex annular surface (62b,

62c, 62c),
in that
 a plurality of ribs (60) protrude on the said
convex surface and extend in a generally radial

direction,
and in that
 a plurality of teeth (66) protrude towards
the interior of the said cavity (68) in a general radial

direction.
An adjustment knob according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the said control portion also
comprises, on the side of the discoidal portion opposite

the mounting portion, a portion (58) having a non-circular
section intended for the control of the knob by

means of a key.
An adjustment knob according to one of Claims 5 and 6,
characterised in that
 the said portion having a non-circular
section (58) has a polygonal exterior section

and a recess (59) with a polygonal interior section
opening onto an end face of the said portion. 
An adjustment knob according to one of Claims 5 to
7,
characterised in that
 the said teeth (66) are formed
on a peripheral region (57d) of the said discoidal

portion and extend radially towards the interior in
the said cavity (68).
An adjustment knob according to Claim 8,
characterised in that
 the said peripheral region
(57d) is flared towards the exterior of the cavity,
and in that
 the said teeth (66) have a height which
increases from the base of the cavity towards the

exterior and have a generally triangular section.
An adjustment knob according to one of Claims 5 to
9,
characterised in that
 the said ribs (60) protrude
radially towards the outside beyond the peripheral

edge of the discoidal portion (57).
An adjustment knob according to Claim 10,
characterised in that
 the said ribs (60) protrude
from the said convex annular portion (57b, 57c, 57d)

over the whole radial range of the latter, and end
in a free edge extending in a general direction at

right angles to the axis of rotation.
An adjustment knob according to Claim 11,
characterised in that
 the discoidal portion defines
on the side of the ribs (60) a second annular cavity

(69) extending radially towards the interior with
respect to the said ribs.
An adjustment knob according to Claim 12,
characterised in that
 certain (60') of the said ribs
are extended radially towards the interior so as to 

divide the said second annular cavity (69) into
several sectors.
An adjustment knob according to Claim 12 or 13,
characterised in that
 the said discoidal portion
(57) comprises, on the side of the first cavity (68)

and radially inside it, a series of second teeth
(64) oriented essentially radially.
An adjustment knob according to Claim 14,
characterised in that
 the said second teeth (64)
have a height which increases from the interior

towards the exterior and have a generally triangular
section.
A headlamp for an automotive vehicle, of the type
comprising a housing (10) sheltering a lamp and a

reflector (20) and closed by glass (30), and a
control rod (150) for the orientation of the

reflector resting on the rear thereof and capable of
translational motion,
characterised in that
 the said control rod is
displaced by an adjustment knob (50) according to

one of the preceding claims, mounted on the said
housing (10).
A headlamp according to Claim 16,
characterised in that
 the housing comprises an re-entrant
sleeve (11) intended to receive the mounting

portion (51) of the adjustment knob (50) in a non-detachable
manner.
A headlamp according to Claim 17,
characterised in that
 the housing comprises, in the
region where the said re-entrant sleeve opens onto

the exterior, an annular grove (12) for the 
positioning of a resilient seal (70) for tightness

and clearance compensation.
A headlamp according to Claim 16,
characterised in that
 its housing comprises on its
outer surface at least one fitting (13) for guiding

a tool intended to cooperate with the control
portion of the adjustment knob.
