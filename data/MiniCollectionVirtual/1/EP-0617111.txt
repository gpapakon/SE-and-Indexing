<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optically 
anisotropic film made of an oriented polymerized liquid 
crystal oligomer (or this can be said hereinafter 
"liquid crystal oligomer polymer") or a composition 
thereof useful as a material of retardation film used 
for liquid crystal display elements, a process 
for producing such a film, a laminate of an optically 
anisotropic film and a base, a composite retardation 
film consisting of said laminate and a uniaxially 
oriented retardation film, and a liquid crystal display 
device using them. The retardation film is a polymeric film 
having optical homogeneity and durability as well as 
uniaxial orientation, and commonly used as an optical 
compensator for improving displaying performance of 
liquid crystal display elements. Super twisted nematic 
(STN) type liquid crystal display elements using such 
retardation films, although having many advantages such 
as light weight, small thickness and low cost, also had 
serious disadvantages such as small viewing angle and 
poor black and white display quality. These disadvantages 
have been significantly alleviated by introduction 
of new techniques such as two-layer lamination of the 
retardation films. However, as regards the viewing  
 
angle, no satisfactory improvement has been made, and 
also no established industrial method is yet available 
for controlling the viewing angle in certain specific 
directions. The viewing angle characteristics of liquid 
crystal display elements are closely associated not only 
with angle dependency of birefringence of liquid crystal 
cell for display but also with angle dependency of 
retardation of retardation film, and it is known that in 
use of conventional retardation films, the smaller the 
angular change of retardation is, the better result is 
obtained. In view of this, it has been proposed to use 
homeotropically oriented liquid crystal material as a 
retardation film having a large refractive index in the 
direction normal to the film plane. Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (JP-A) 
2-73327 and JP-A-2-105111 disclose methods using a 
birefringent layer in which the in-plane refractive 
index is isotropic but the refractive index in the 
thickness direction is greater than the in-plane 
refractive index, for reducing the angular change of 
background color of the optically uniaxial birefringent 
body (liquid crystal cell for display) having positive 
anisotropy of refractive index. A typical example of 
material having such refractive index anisotropy is a
