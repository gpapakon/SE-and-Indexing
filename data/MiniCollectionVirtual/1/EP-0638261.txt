<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for determining the colour of a make-up foundation. This device comprises:   a) means (12) for measuring the skin colour on the inside of the arm or outside of the arm or on both the inside and outside of the arm, preferably in a mid-region of the forearm in which the colour of the veins is not substantially noticeable, thus excluding parts where there are blotches or noticeable veins, b) means (18) for the calculation and determination of the skin colour measured by the measuring means (12), these means of determination (18) comprising a database containing a range of reference make-up foundation colours substantially covering a representative sample of a population of individuals concerned, this database containing at least the following data:   - the skin colour on the inside of the arm or outside of the arm or on both the inside and outside of the arm, preferably in a mid-region of the forearm in which the colour of the veins is not substantially noticeable, thus excluding parts where there are blotches or noticeable veins, - a reference make-up foundation colour associated with one or more skin colours of the abovementioned database,   c) the abovementioned means of determination (18) comprising means of comparison of the measured skin colour of the person concerned with the skin colours appearing in the database, in order to determine which colour of the database is the identical or closely similar one, and consequently to determine in the abovementioned database the make-up foundation colour associated with this skin colour, and, advantageously, means (20) for displaying the make-up foundation colour which has been determined.   The invention enables the colour of a make-up foundation substantially reproducing a person's natural skin colour to be determined.
