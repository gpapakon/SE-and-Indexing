<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an optical waveguide 

module which is arranged to be free from a breakage of a 
coupling part of an optical waveguide and optical fibers which 

are housed in a housing and deviation of an optical axis at 
this coupling part even though a tensile force is applied to 

optical fibers. A waveguide board (14) having an optical 
waveguide (13) is housed in a housing (10) and an optical 

connector (15) to which bare optical fibers (16) are connected 
is bonded to an end face of the waveguide board to form a first 

holding part (17). An optical fiber conductor (11) and an 
optical fiber tape (12) are introduced into the housing (10) 

through a side wall (18) of the housing, and the covering parts 
of the optical fiber conductor and an optical fiber tape are 

bonded to the side wall of the housing with a bonding agent to 
form a second holding part (21). The bonding strength of the 

second holding part (21) ia determined to be larger than the 
bonding strength of the first holding part (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
waveguide module for use in optical fibers communications
network and the like.An optical waveguide module is generally formed with
a module unit which is provided to connect an end face of
an optical waveguide and end faces of optical fibers and
housed in a housing sealed with nitrogen gas or the like.
In this optical waveguide module, a covering member for
the optical fibers is fixed to a part of the housing to
stationarily stabilize the module unit.Various methods for increasing a strength of a
coupling part of the end faces of the optical waveguide
and the optical fibers have been studied. As regards the
coupling part of the optical waveguide and the optical
fibers, there have been many restrictions such as, for
example, necessities of centering of the optical axis and
use of synthetic resin material having a refractive index
of which matches those of the optical waveguide and the
optical fibers.The optical waveguide and the optical fibers may be
connected in an arrangement as shown in Fig. 1 to ensure 
complete connection. A block 3 is mounted on an upper
surface of a waveguide board 2 on which an optical
waveguide 1 is formed, a connector 5 connected to the end
faces of the optical fibers 4 is positioned to abut
against the end face of the waveguide board 2 and the end
face of the block 3 and fixed with a bonding agent.In the arrangement shown in Fig. 1, the block 3 is
mounted on the waveguide board 2 and the strength of the
coupling part of the waveguide board 2 and the optical
fibers 4 is increased by increasing a contact area with
the connector 5. However, this method requires a work
such as alignment with the block 3 for which attentions
should be exercised.EP 0 456 026 discloses a device having fibres
coupled to end faces of integrated waveguides.An object of the present invention is to provide an
optical waveguide module which is housed in a housing and
adapted so that, even when a tensile force acts on the
optical fibers and this tensile force is conducted to the
coupling part of the optical waveguide and the optical
fibers, the deviation of the optical axis and the destruction
of the coupling part may be prevented.To realize the above-described object, it is an
object of the present invention to provide an optical
waveguide module according to claims 1 and 5. Since the bonding strength of
the first fixing part is provided to be larger than that
of the second fixing part, even when an
external force acts on the optical fibers so as to pull
