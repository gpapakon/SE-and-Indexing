<ABSTRACT>
A fuel coal processing system is provided which consists of a centrifugal type pulverizer which consists of a pair of opposed multicup concentric ring rotors (5) and (6), a coal purifier (12) which consists of an annular ring nozzle surrounding the outer periphery of the pulverizer rotors and an optional fuel coal size classifier (13), all combined into one integral, cooperatively acting, fuel coal preparation device. Triboelectrostatic purification means may also be used alone or in conjunction with the aerodynamic means to more effectively handle different conditions and kinds of coal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE OF THE INVENTIONCoal Pulverizer Purifier ClassifierFIE ~~ OF THE INVENTION This invention lates generally to methods and apparatuses for proces.-. i coal for burning, with less environment contamination , steam generation boilers such as are used in electric power generation facilities, and more particularly to a coal pulverizer-purifier-classifier used in conjunction therewith.PRIOR ART AND BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONMore specifically, the purpose of this invention is to improve the technology of pulverizing coal for burning in electric power generation boilers. This is done with a machine that is basically a system of spinning counter rotating rotors uniquely combined with means for ι electrostatically and/or aerodynamically separating the fine pure coal from the pyritic and other impurities.As chunks of coal are fed in through an axial center mounted feed tube, they are caused to smash repeatedly, at high velocity, onto other coal chunks and particles which have accumulated on the rings. By having the coal particles themselves act as the primary abrasion and reduction agents, material wear is minimized. Reduced in size from the series of abrasive collisions, the particles finally exit as an evenly dispersed circumferential spray of very fine 

 material. At this point in the process, an in-stream aerodynamic and/or electrostatic separation action can readily be utilized to remove a high percentage of the sulfur and iron pyritic impurities contained therein.Currently used pulverizing technology uses direct crushing means such as hammer mills, ball mills or roll mills of various configurations. In these mills, air is swept through the mill and as the coal is reduced to a fine enough size to be airborne the dust particles are entrained in the air stream and carried out of -the mill to the combus or.For material to leave the mill it has to stay in the mill until it is reduced to dust fine enough to become airborne by repeated crushing actions of the rolling or flailing elements of the mill. Pure coal and impure coal both leave the mill when ground down fine enough to be swept up by the air currents blowing through the mill. Therefore, significant separation of pure and impure coal does not take place in these types of reduction mills.When coal is mined, it often carries impurities mixed in its seams in the form of streaks ranging from small fractions of an inch to several inches in thickness. These stratified streaks of impurities are chiefly composed of both iron pyrites and sulfur, and when

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A fuel coal processing system, comprising, a centrifugal type coal pulverizer means, a coal purifier means, said centrifugal type coal pulverize and said coal purifier being combined into one integral fuel coal preparation device.
2. A fuel coal processing system, comprising, a centrifugal type coal pulverizer means, a coal purifier means, and a fuel size classifier means with said centrifugal type coal pulverizer means, said coal purifier means, and said fuel size classifier means all being combined into one integral, cooperatively acting, fuel coal preparation device.
3. A fuel coal processing system as set forth in claim 1, wherein said coal pulverizer means consists of a pair of opposed multi-cup concentric ring rotors, said rotors being concentrically mounted on a common axis and counter rotating at relatively high speed, and an axially located feed tube, whereby when coarse material is fed into the center of the rotor system through said axially located feed tube and said material is centrifugally thrown tangentially, progressively and outwardly from cup to cup on each of said counter 


 rotating rotors, said material is reduced in size from mostly chunks to ractically all dust by the repeated high speed impacts an skidding abrasion associated with the process.
4. A fuel coal processin. system as set forth in claim 1, wherein said pulverizer »ans consists of a pair of opposed multiconcentric ring tors, mounted on a common axis, counter rotating at relatively high speed, with an axially located feed tube.
5. A fuel coal processing system as set forth in claim 1, wherein said pulverizer means consists of a ir of opposed multiconcentric ri. rotors, mounted on -. common axis, countei rotating at rel. vely high speed, with an axially located feed tube and means to ensure that the spray of said pulverizer material leaves the ro*v.r system in a flat, radiating, sheet spray pattern.
6. A fuel coal processing system as set forth in claim 3, wherein said counter rotating rotors are individually powered by separate variable speed motors, said variable speed motors being set at such a speed to turn said counter rotating rotors at an optimal crushing velocity whereby the softer pure coal material is completely reduced to dust size particles but the harder impure kernels and chucks receive a minimal amount of reduction. 


 7. A fuel coal processing machine as set forth in claim 3, a stratified flow splitter blade means, and an annular ring air nozzle means, wherein pulverized coal is aerodynamically purified by means in which the rotor system is concentrically surrounded by said annular ring air nozzle immediately adjacent to said rotor system and is itself surrounded by said stratified flow splitter blade means to deflect air-stratified, impure, relatively dense coal particles downwardly to a discharge chute and less dense pure coal particles upwardly to be passed onto a combustor, said stratification being caused by a high velocity air stream jetting upwardly and through the sheet of pulverized material leaving the rotor system and causing the less dense pure coal to accelerate to a different plane than that of the more dense impure particles.
8. A fuel coal processing machine as set forth in claim 7, and a size classifier means, and wherein the purified coal passing above said splitter blade means on the way to said combustor is carried through said size classifier means by the coal transporting air stream wherein on size coal is carried onto said combustor and oversize coal particles are recirculated back to the pulverizer for further reduction.

A fuel coal processor as set forth in claim 4, wherein the flat sheet of centrifugally flying pulverized coal leaving the ringed cup area of the rotors traverses a relatively close spare, between two rotor surrounding rings that are dielectricall;/ supported and carry charges of opposite polarity, the lower ring being positive and the upper ring being negative and by being so charged attract and repel upwardly the triboelectric positively charged pure coal material and downwardly the negatively charged pyritic material as the pulverized material leaves the electrostatic ring assembly to pass over a concentrically mounted scoop ring that is adjacent to said lower electrostatically charged ring and just high enough to scoop off the lower strata of negatively charged pyritic material to be rejected from the process as the remaining product passes onto said combustor.
10, A fuel coal processing machine as set forth in claim S, vherein the fuel coal product is passed on from the electrostatic purification stage to said size classifier means where the oversize coal is separated out and returned to said pulverizer for further reduction and the fuel grade coal is flown on through to said combustor. 


 11. A fuel coal processing machine as set forth in claim 9, wherein the pure coal and heavier pyrites pass on from said electrostatic purification stage to said aerodynamic purification stage wherein an upwardly moving jet of air causes pure coal to pass above said annular splitter blade means to be passed on through to said combustor while denser pyritic material is rejected.
12. A fuel coal processor as set forth in claim 2, wherein a pure coal portion is passed through said size classifier means to separate out oversize coal and send it back through for further reduction and the on size coal is passed on through to the combustor.
