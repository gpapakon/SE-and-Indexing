<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene efficiently by isomerizing 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene using at least 
one acid selected from the group consisting of sulfuric acid and sulfonic acids. This process allows the use of 

inexpensive catalysts such as sulfuric acid and sulfonic acids, and also the use of a mixture of propene dimerization 
products as such in the isomerization without necessity for removing the dimerization catalyst components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
2,3-dimethyl-2-butene (hereinafter referred to as "TMEN"). In
particular, the present invention relates to a process for preparing
TMEN by isomerizing 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene (hereinafter referred to
as "DMB-1").TMEN is an important compound as a basic intermediate
for agrochemicals, medicines, perfumes, cosmetic materials, and so
on. For the preparation thereof, there is known a process comprising
contacting DMB-1 which is synthesized by dimerization of propene
with a following solid or liquid isomerization catalyst to convert
DMB-1 to TMEN:
(1) A solid base catalyst such as Na-Al2O3 (cf. Japanese
Patent KOKAI Publication Nos. 196526/1988, 196527/1988, 8707/1973,
and the like),(2) Sulfonated divinylbenzene-styrene copolymer (cf.
German Patent No. 2,449,298, Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No.
280031/1988, and the like),(3) Molecular sieves 5A or 5-13A (cf. US Patent No.
3,636,124, German Patent No. 2,055,478, and the like),(4) AlEt3/1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol
catalyst (cf. Japanese Patent KOKAI Publication No. 209028/1987,
and the like).However, in a case where the above solid catalysts (1),
(2) and (3) are used as the isomerization catalysts, when DMB-1 is
isomerized without separating a dimerization catalyst from the 
dimerization reaction product, an isomerization activity and a life of
the catalyst are deteriorated because the solid catalyst may absorb
the dimerization catalyst. Therefore, the dimerization catalyst
should be removed from the dimerization reaction product.The process which uses the liquid isomerization catalyst
(4) has a drawback that an expensive alcohol is used as a catalyst
component.An object of the present invention is to provide a process
for preparing TMEN from DMB-1 using the reaction product from the
dimerization of propene in the isomerization process without
removing the dimerization catalyst from the dimerization reaction
product.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a process for preparing TMEN comprising isomerizing
DMB-1 at a temperature of -70°C to +150°C
in the presence of at least one acid selected from
sulfuric acid having a concentration of at least 70% and sulfonic acids
wherein the amount of the sulfuric acid or sulfonic acid is from 0.01
to 5.0 wt% based on DMB-1.According to a second aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a process for preparing 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene
comprising forming 2,3-dimethyl-1-butene from propene in the
presence of a
