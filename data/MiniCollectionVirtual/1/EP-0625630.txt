<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises (a) a mobile reservoir (1) of cryogenic liquid, (b) means (21, 22) secured to the reservoir for drawing off and vaporising successive fractions of the cryogenic liquid so as to bring the vapour obtained to a predetermined pressure for supplying the apparatus, and (c) means (9, 12) for selectively causing the feeding of this apparatus with the vapour thus obtained. Application especially to the feeding of a cryogenic freezing plant with pneumatic pump (7) incorporated into the reservoir, with cryogenic liquid.

Autonomous device for supplying energy to an 
apparatus (7) driven by a gas under pressure, comprising 

a transportable cryogenic liquid tank (1) and means 
associated with the tank for drawing off and vaporizing 

the liquid in the tank and sending it to the apparatus 
(7), characterized in that the drawing-off and vaporizing 

means include at least one circuit portion (2
1
, 2
2
) which 
incorporates a vaporizing means (5
1
, 5
2
) and is delimited 
between a non-return valve (4
1
, 4
2
) upstream and a 
controlled valve (6
1
, 6
2
) downstream. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the tank (1) is of the double-wall (1
1
, 1
2
) type, at 
least one upstream part of the circuit portion (2
1
, 2
2
) 
being arranged between the said walls (1
1
, 1
2
). 
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that it includes two circuit portions 

(2
1
, 2
2
) in parallel, the respective valves (6
1
, 6
2
) of 
which are sequentially controlled by a control device (9, 

12). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the control device (9, 12) is sensitive to the 

pressure (P
1
; P
2
) existing in the circuit portion (2
1
; 2
2
). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the apparatus (7) is a pump for delivering 

the cryogenic liquid contained in the tank (1). 
Application of a device according to Claim 5 to 
the supplying of cryogenic liquid to a plant for freezing 

foodstuffs.
