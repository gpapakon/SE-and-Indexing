<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine 
with exhaust control device having an exhaust gas control 

valve (57), which is driven by a servomechanism mounted directly on 
the cylinder block (22) at one end of the engine and, preferrably, 

adjacent the flywheel so as to provide a compact assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an internal combustion engine,
comprising a cylinder block and a cylinder head affixed
thereto, an exhaust port arrangement and exhaust gas control
valve assembly for controlling said exhaust port arrangement,
whereby a direct drive unit is provided at the cylinder block
to operate the exhaust gas control valve.In many types of engine applications, particularly those
employing two cycle engines, it has been proposed to employ
an exhaust control valve that controls the timing of opening
and closing of the exhaust port and/or the effective
compression ratio of the engine. By changing the position
of the exhaust control valve, it is possible to operate at
higher compression ratios under low and mid-range load and
to reduce the compression ratio to extend the engine life
under high loads. In addition, the variation in the timing
of the exhaust port opening and closing can be adjusted for
other purposes such as exhaust emission control or the like.This type of control is frequently used on vehicles such as
motorcycles that are very compact in nature and do not
afford significant room for external mounting of accessories
or controls directly on the engine. Therefore, it has been
the practice to provide a wire transmitter that is operated
by a remote operator and which controls the exhaust control
valve. However, the use of such motion transmitting
mechanisms can induce inaccuracies in the system.Moreover, an internal combustion engine as indicated above is
known from documents EP 0 482 662 or EP 0 382 063,
respectively.However, the driving means according to the embodiments
disclosed in these documents for driving or operating the
exhaust gas control valve is arranged so as to be relatively
close to the cylinder block so that they may be influenced by 
heat transfer which may lead to malfunctions of said driving
means.Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to
provide an improved internal combustion engine as indicated
above which facilitates with simple technical means an
enhancement of the longevity of the drive means for the exhaust
gas control valve.According to the invention, this objective is solved for an
internal combustion engine as indicated above in that the
crankshaft supports an accessory drive pulley on an exposed
forward end and a flywheel at the opposite end, said flywheel
being contained within a flywheel cover, said direct drive unit
being provided above the flywheel cover at the same side of the
cylinder block when the internal combustion engine
