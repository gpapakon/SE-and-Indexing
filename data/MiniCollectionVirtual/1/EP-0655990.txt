<ABSTRACT>
Process for baking gypsum under superheated steam conditions consisting in stirring the charge in a rotary horizontal cylindrical oven and independently adjusting oven chamber pressure and temperature according to the temperature of the gypsum, the ambient temperature and pressure in said chamber and the charge's mass. The baking process according to the invention provides a high quality beta semihydrate-type plaster with a treatment cycle of less than one hour, and also provides all types of plasters, especially a blend of beta semihydrate and anhydrite II. The oven for carrying out said process includes means for sealing off its ends so that treatment can be carried out under controlled pressure. It also includes at its outlet, a sealed housing (19) with facilities (43) for receiving temperature and pressure sensors and especially a pyrometer (42) inserted into the central part of the oven to monitor the charge's temperature. At the same time that they monitor temperature and pressure, the sensors (13) indicate the evolution of the mass of the charge to be treated. A computer analyzes and processes all this data, adjusting oven chamber pressure and temperature as required, especially according to the type of plaster desired.

A process for baking gypsum in a rotating horizontal cylindrical oven, fitted with means
to carry out an overheated steam pressure treatment, characterised in that consists in:

introducing in the oven, a determined mass of gypsum, heating the gypsum indirectly, stirring
this load in a continuous and homogeneous way and adjusting the following parameters

during the process, and independently, the temperature and pressure in the enclosure of the
oven according to the temperature of the load, the ambient temperature in the enclosure, the

pressure in the enclosure and the evolution of the mass of the load during calcining, in order
to obtain in less than one hour a high quality semihydrate betatype plaster as well as all types

of plaster desired, especially a mixture of semihydrate and anhydrite II. 
An oven for the implementation of the process according
to claim 1, of the type comprising a rotating

horizontal vessel whose cylindrical centre part is
heated by gases or other means, which oven is fitted

with crowns carried by supporting rollers, characterised
in that it contains:


stirring means which distribute the heat over
the load;
means for blanking off the ends of the oven;
means for weighing the load during the treatment:
means to control the surrounding temperatures
of the oven and of the load as well as means to

regulate the pressure inside the oven;
means to adjust the temperature and the pressure
according to the category of plaster requested.
A gypsum baking oven, according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the stirring means are made of helical

spirals (20) stretching between the inlet (7) and
the outlet (8), on the inside wall of the oven and,

mainly in the cylindrical centre part (2), with blades
(21) placed between the spirals in order to form with

the latter a kind of shovel or bucket which, according
to the rotation direction of the oven, will be actuated

to perform the stirring motion of the load or de-actuated
to enable the discharge of the product at the

end of the treatment cycle.
A gypsum baking oven according to claim 2, characterised
in that the blanking means are constituted,

at the oven outlet, of a tight and fixed box (19)
mounted via a rotary seal (27), at the outlet of the

oven, which box exhibits especially: an outlet orifice
fined with a plug enabling the discharge of the

product at the end of the treatment cycle.
A gypsum baking oven according to claim 4, characterised
in that the box (19) contains a support (43)

enabling to guide and to adjust a pyrometric stick
(42) plunging inside the oven, to be directly in contact

with the load.
A gypsum baking oven according to claim 5, characterised
in that the box (19) consists of a double

wall :

an inside cylindrical wall (26) fitted at one of its
ends, with the rotary seal (27) and at its other

end, with a cap (29) forming among others the
support (43) of the pyrometric stick :
a fixed outside wall (32) in the form of a cylindrical
envelope or of a ferrule, connected rigidly

to the inside wall (26) via a tight and spring-loaded
compensation system (33).
A gypsum baking oven according to claim 6, characterised
in that the outside wall (32) contains, at

its lower section, a cylindrical skirting (35) stretching
downwards, forming a kind of seat for a flap (36),

conical in shape and pointed upwards, which flap is
actuated by a jack (37) arranged, tightly, on the outside

wall (32).
A gypsum baking oven according to claim 6, characterised
in that the compensating system (33) is

made of two cores (34) of a material such as a flexible
composite elastomer, whose section is in the

shape of a U, which cores are arranged at the ends
of the outside cylindrical envelope (32) between the

latter and the inside cylindrical wall (26).
A gypsum baking oven according to claim 6, characterised
in that the box (19) contains at least one

orifice (45) enabling the discharge of steam and
mists to be controlled by a valve (46) and orifices 

for the positioning of sensors (40, 41) enabling to
control the surrounding temperature and pressure

within the oven.
A gypsum baking oven, according to claim 2, characterised
in that the weighing means are made of

sensors (13) arranged at the level of the supporting
rollers (10).
A gypsum baking oven according to claim 2, characterised
in that the inlet (7) comprises a protective

cover (18) that can be switched between an active
blanking position and a passive position, via a jack

(22), which protective cover contains means (23)
enabling to apply tightly the said protective cover

onto the end of the inlet (7).
