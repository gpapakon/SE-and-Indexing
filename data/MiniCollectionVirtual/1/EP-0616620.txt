<ABSTRACT>
A sprayable granular coating is disclosed which is useful for forming a simulated granite surface having high-impact strength, superior hardness, and an aesthetically-pleasing presentation. The composition includes a gel coat, granules and a filler which are all isopycnic in density. The composition, when combined with a hardener, may be sprayed into a mold and backed with fiberglass, plastic or other suitable resin to form a panel or similar structure, or may be directly sprayed to surfaces to provide a simulated-granite appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
composition of matter useful in forming a granite-like
coating and to a method for forming an article having a
granite-like coating.Processes currently exist for forming synthetic materials
and surfaces which give the appearance of or simulate various
natural substances such as stone, marble and the like. Such
materials are commonly used in the manufacture of floor and other
types of tiles, countertops, sinks, architectural facings,
ornamental objects, and generally for any other purpose that
marble, stone or the like are used.One example is a process utilizing a laminated sheet of
material marketed under the trademark FORMICA. Such material is
formed in large sheets and then cut and applied to the desired
surface by adhesive or the like. Such sheets can be manufactured
in solid colors or in various patterns, some of which simulate
various stone or other textured material. 
Another example is a process for preparing a material
which is commonly referred to as "cultured marble".
"Cultured marble" is formed by first creating a mould of
a desired shape, spraying the internal mould surface with
a gel coat and then filling the mould with a conventional
casting resin. Pigments are added to the resin to give
it the desired colour or pattern. After the resins have
set, the mould is removed with the surface facing the
mould forming the outer surface of the finished product.Although many of the prior art methods for creating
synthetic surfaces simulating stone and the like are
generally acceptable, there is a continuing effort to
develop new and more desirable or pleasing patterns as
well as patterns which more closely simulate the various
natural materials such as stone, granite and the like.
Accordingly, there is a continuing need and desire to
improve upon existing methods.For example, US patent specification no. 5 043 377
relates to an artificial stone composition comprising a
matrix and chips dispersed in that matrix. The matrix
resins are addition polymers of trimethylol propane
trimethacrylate. The chips are made from the same or a
different resin and, in the cured state, are of the same
or similar density as the cured matrix resin.PCT patent specification no. 89/1504 describes 
unspecified polyester resins encasing aluminium
trihydrate (as flame retardant), which are cured and
added, in the particulate form, to the matrix without
modifying the matrix by direct addition of the aluminium
trihydrate, so that a uniform mixture is maintained that
can be used to make

<CLAIMS>
A composition useful for forming a granite-like
coating, which composition comprises:


(a) a gel coat resin comprising an ethylenically
unsaturated polyester resin based on isophthalic

acid;
(b) granules of the polyester resin of (a) in premade
form; and
(c) aluminum trihydrate, said aluminium trihydrate being present in an amount not greater than
50 percent by weight of the total composition;

the polyester granules (b) having substantially the same
density as the gel coat resin (a) when admixed with

component (c).
A composition according to claim 1, wherein the
amount of aluminium trihydrate is from 25 to 50% w/w.
A composition according to claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein the granules contain a filler to achieve

substantially the same density as the gel coat containing
the aluminum trihydrate.
A composition according to any preceding claim,
wherein the unsaturated polyester resin is based on

isophthalic acid and neopentyl glycol. 
A method for forming an article having a granite-like
coating, which method comprises spraying onto the

article or onto a mould forming the article, a
composition according to any preceding claim and a

hardener, and curing or allowing the composition to cure.
