<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a colorless rosin characterized by dehydrogenating a pure hydrogenated rosin in 
the presence of a dehydrogenation catalyst. The obtained rosin is substantially colorless, odorless and excellent in 

stability, and is particularly excellent in various properties, such as odor, stability and compatibility, in a heated state. 
Therefore it can suitably be used not only as a modifier for soap detergent compositions, but also, in the form of an 

alkali metal salt thereof, as an emulsifier for emulsion polymerization of synthetic rubbers. Further it can suitably 
be used, when esterified, as a tackifier for hot-melt adhesives, a modifier for various rubbers and plastics, a starting 

material for traffic paints, a base for chewing gums, a modifier for inks and coating materials, a pigment coating agent 
and a solder flux, thus being capable of improving the sales appeal of the final products.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing colorless rosins which are colorless, odorless
and excellent in heat stability and weatherability.Conventionally, rosins and their derivatives,
i.e., rosin esters are used as tackifiers for adhesives or
pressure sensitive adhesives, modifiers for rubbers or
plastics, resins for traffic paints, sizes for paper
making, emulsifiers for synthetic rubbers, resin materials
for inks and resins for paints, and the like. The above-mentioned
rosin compounds are insufficient in views of
their yellow or yellowish brown color, odor, and heat
stability and weatherability (hereinafter both properties
may be sometimes referred to as "stabilities").In order to solve the defects of the rosin
compounds, there have been commercially available, for
example, disproportionated rosins which are improved in
heat stability by disproportionation of raw rosins,
hydrogenated rosins which are improved in the stabilities
to a certain extent by hydrogenating raw rosins, or
esterified rosins prepared by using the disproportionated
rosins or the hydrogenated rosins. Those are, however,
insufficient in views of color and stabilities.There is described in JP-B-33771/1970 and JP-B-20599/1974
a process for disproportionation of rosins or
rosin compounds with the particular organic sulfur
compounds. The disproportionated rosins obtained
according to that process are, however, insufficient in
views of color, odor and stabilities.As mentioned above, every conventional rosin,
disproportionated rosin and hydrogenated rosin cannot 
simultaneously satisfy all the properties, i.e., color,
odor and stabilities. Accordingly, it has been desired to
produce colorless and odorless rosins having good
stabilities.In JP-A-64 85 265 a process for the preparation of such colorless and odorless
rosin is described which uses the hydrogenation of purified disproportinated rosin.An object of the present invention is,
considering the above circumstances, to provide a novel
process for producing colorless rosins which are improved
in the properties of color, odor and stabilities of the
conventional rosins.As a result of studying to improve the above-mentioned
properties in views of various conditions such
as kind of rosins, purification operation and
dehydrogenation reaction, a novel process for preparing
colorless rosins which are in compliance with the object
of the present invention, i.e., colorless, odorless and
excellent in stabilities was found in which purified
hydrogenated rosins are used as starting
