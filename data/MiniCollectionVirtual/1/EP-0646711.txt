<ABSTRACT>
A system and method compensates for systematic 
irregularities in measured engine velocities caused by 

torsional flexing in the crankshaft during rotation to 
improve the accuracy of misfire detection. The present 

invention compensates for irregularities in 
"Profile-Ignition-Pick-Up interval" (PIP interval) timing. 

These irregularities are systematic with respect to 
different engine cylinders. The present invention is 

configured to function with a processor unit. Correction 
factors for each of the 
n
 PIP intervals of an engine cycle 
are generated for each of a multitude of engine operating 

conditions, where 
n
 is the number of cylinders in the 
engine. Each set of 
n
 generated correction factor is stored 
in a table (a "look-up table" located in a memory unit) 

having a corresponding unique address location. This table 
is typically determined empirically i
n the calibration of 
the engine type by a test engine. The correction factors 

are generated while the test engine is rotated at a fixed 
steady state operating point with combustion, where the 

operating point is typically a particular speed and load.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to misfire
detection in internal combustion engines, and more
specifically to a system and method that adjusts for
systematic irregularities in measured engine velocities
caused by torsional flexing of the crankshaft during
rotation.One way to detect misfires in internal combustion
engines is to measure crankshaft speed and observe
fluctuations in speed. Detection of deviations in
crankshaft velocities (as manifested by abnormal
acceleration values) from expected normal crankshaft
velocities is an indication of misfire. Deviations in
acceleration are determined over nominally equal successive
intervals of crankshaft rotation, referred to as
"Profile-Ignition-Pick-Up intervals" (PIP intervals). A PIP
signal is a digital signal received from a sensor, which
detects specified positions of rotation of a crankshaft
mounted wheel during engine rotation. PIP intervals are
also known as combustion intervals, which are equal in
length (but not necessarily phase) to the angular rotation
between top dead centres of adjacent cylinders in the firing
order.Ideally, during normal operation, an engine will produce
a series of PIP transition signals whose periods indicate
the average crankshaft velocity during a substantial portion
of the power stroke for each of the cylinders in the engine.
The crankshaft velocity will either remain constant (zero
acceleration), increase (positive acceleration) or decrease
(negative acceleration) depending on whether the engine is
operating at steady state, accelerating or decelerating,
respectively. For example, if a normal engine is operating
under steady-state operation (no acceleration), then it is
expected to produce an acceleration value of near zero over
successive PIP intervals. However, if a particular cylinder 
in an engine produces a sufficiently negative value during
steady-state operation, then this occurrence will be
interpreted as a misfire condition, since a zero value is
expected as an output for all cylinders in a normal engine
during steady state operation.Accordingly, misfire detectors in general look for
individual cylinders yielding acceleration values different
from the local norm of all cylinders, where the local norm
depends upon the operating condition (i.e., steady state,
acceleration, or deceleration, etc.). The problem is that
individual cylinders in normal engines tend to yield values
of velocity, which differ slightly from the local norm of
all cylinders in a systematic manner according to cylinder
number. In a
