<ABSTRACT>
For the extrusion of elongated articles, such as 
tubular articles or articles in sheet form made of plastic, 

the material delivered by the extruder (1) is forced by a 
positive-displacement pump (4) through an extrusion nozzle 

(3). The average absolute wall thickness of the extruded 
article (9) is calculated from the volumetric delivery of 

the positive-displacement pump, the line speed and the 
nominal dimensions in the transverse direction of the 

extruded article. A series of measurements is also carried 
out in a direction at right angles to the lengthwise direction 

of the extruded article and over the entire surface 
thereof, in each measurement the value of the variable 

measured by the measuring element being a measure of the 
relative wall thickness locally. Periodically, after a 

stationary state in the extrusion process has been reached, 
the calculated average absolute wall thickness and the 

average value of the variable measured by the measuring 
element (11), inter alia, are used to determine the current 

relation between the absolute wall thickness and the value 
of the variable measured by the measuring element. For the 

regulation of the wall thickness in the lengthwise 
direction of the extruded article, the line speed is 

adapted in such a way that the current value of the wall 
thickness is always essentially equal to the desired value 

of the wall thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for extruding 
elongated articles, such as tubular articles or articles in 
sheet form made of plastic, and regulating their wall 
thickness, in which method the material delivered by the 
extruder is forced through an extrusion nozzle, the average 
absolute wall thickness of an extruded article is 
calculated, a series of measurements is carried out in a 
direction at right angles to the lengthwise direction of 
the extruded article and over the entire surface thereof, 
in each measurement the value of the variable measured by 
the measuring element being a measure of the relative wall 
thickness locally, periodically, after a stationary state 
in the extrusion process has been reached, the calculated 
average absolute wall thickness and the average value of 
the variable measured by the measuring element, inter alia, 
are used to determine the current relation between the 
absolute wall thickness and the value of the variable 
measured by the measuring element, and for the regulation 
of the wall thickness in the lengthwise direction of the 
extruded article the line speed is adapted in such a way 
that the current value of the wall thickness is always 
essentially the same as the desired value of the wall 
thickness. Such a method is known from Dutch Patent Application 
No. 8801813 in the name of Applicant. In the case of this known method the average 
absolute wall thickness of the extruded article is 
calculated from the quantity by weight of material fed to 
the extruder per unit time, the line speed, the specific 
weight of the material and the nominal dimensions in the 
transverse direction of the extruded article. This 
calculation of the average absolute wall thickness is time-consuming 
and relatively inaccurate, since it is necessary 
to convert the weight of the quantity of material fed to 
the extruder per unit time and the volume of the quantity 
of material coming out of the extruder per unit time. The  
 
specific weight of the material has to be used for this 
conversion. There is no indication whatsoever of the 
accuracy of the calculation or its possible fluctuation. 
Besides, the known method is less suitable for use in the 
case of single-screw extruders, since such extruders do not 
produce any guaranteed output. The output of single-screw 
extruders depends on a large number of factors, including 
the counterpressure in the extrusion nozzle, the 
coefficient of friction between the plastic material and 
the housing of the extruder, on the one
