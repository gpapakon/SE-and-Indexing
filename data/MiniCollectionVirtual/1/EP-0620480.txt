<ABSTRACT>
The occurrence of pressure marks can be reduced by protective coatings containing suitable additives. However, this adversely affects other properties of the recording materials, such as sensitivity, contrast and clarity. Recording materials having protective coatings containing polyolefin oxidates are substantially insensitive to pressure marks and have low haze, high sensitivity and high contrast. The novel recording materials can be used in all areas of photographic and radiographic image production, in particular in the reproduction of colour images in the print precursor and in the recording of X-ray images in medical diagnostics.
