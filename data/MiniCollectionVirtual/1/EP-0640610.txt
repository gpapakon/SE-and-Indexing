<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method of providing a
uniform dosimetry of vapor phase trimethylindium for epitaxial
growth processes, such as metalorganic chemical vapor deposition
(MOCVD).The most commonly used indium compound for MOCVD or other
epitaxial deposition processes is trimethylindium. Materials
produced by epitaxial growth using trimethylindium as an indium
source include, for example InP, InGaAs, InGaAlP, InGaAsP,
InGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs, InAs, InSb and InAsBi.A well-known inherent disadvantage of trimethylindium as an
indium source is the fact that it is a solid at room temperature.
Liquid sources of organometallic vapors are preferred to solid
sources because a gas stream having a substantially constant
partial pressure of organometallic vapors can be produced merely
by bubbling carrier gas through the liquid at a constant rate.
With solids, on the other hand, the surface area is constantly
changing as the organometallic source is vaporized. Furthermore,
solids, such as trimethylindium, tend to recondense on surfaces
of the gas pathway, further increasing the difficulty of
providing a uniform partial pressure of the organometallic
compound.Trimethylindium, being a solid, is an anomaly relative to 
other trialkylindiums, as C2-C5 alkylindiums are liquids at room
temperature. This anomaly is the result of trimethylindium
existing as a tetramer at room temperature, whereas other
trialkylindiums are monomers. However, from the standpoint of
providing a sufficiently high vapor pressure for epitaxial growth
applications, trimethylindium, having a relatively high vapor
pressure, tends to be preferred.Several approaches have been taken to eliminate
complications due to uneven mass flow when using trimethylindium.
Some of these include reverse flow of carrier gas through the
bubbler; packing the trimethylindium in inert material, such as
Teflon beads, in the bubbler; use of two or more trimethylindium
bubblers in series; and "solution trimethylindium" where the
trimethylindium is dissolved and/or suspended in a high boiling
amine or high boiling hydrocarbon.Those approaches in which the trimethylindium remains in
solid phase, reduce, but do not eliminate, uneven mass flow.While trimethylindium may be dissolved in amine, its
solubility is low, typically about 20%, requiring a large volume
of trimethylindium source. Amines complex with trimethylindium,
advantageously breaking up the tetramer, but disadvantageously
tying up trimethylindium. Because epitaxial growth applications
require a source
