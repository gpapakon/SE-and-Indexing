<ABSTRACT>
A keyboardless-entry computer system includes a transparent input screen (18) that 
generates positional information when contacted by a stylus (16) and a display screen (20) 

mounted below the input screen so that a displayed symbol can be viewed through the input 
screen. Handwritten symbols can be entered using the stylus and the corresponding positional 

information is input to a processor to identify the symbol. When a predetermined command 
symbol is identified, a window area is displayed on the display screen in which a handwritten 

symbol or symbols can be entered. When the entry in the window is complete, a further 
command closes the window and, for example, inserts the contents of the window into a 

document displayed on the display screen at a position determined by the location of the 
window opening command in the document on the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
keyboardless input method and apparatus for a computer, and
when combined with a central processing unit, to a
keyboardless-entry computer system. More particularly, the
present invention may be implemented in an information
storage, manipulation and transfer device on which text,
data, computer commands and functions can be entered by
writing alphanumeric or any other characters and symbols by
hand with a pen-like stylus on an Input/Output (I/O) screen.
In a preferred embodiment the I/O screen includes a
transparent touch screen incorporated over a substantially
flat output display. The present invention in a preferred
embodiment may be implemented in a self-contained computer
system or in a peripheral to a host computer.Large amounts of information and sophisticated
applications software are now available on conventional
keyboard computers. We have appreciated that the utility of
this information and of applications software could be
greatly increased if text and data could be entered and
applications software manipulated by writing in a normal
fashion directly on a flat display. Thus, there is a need to
allow the utility of computer technology to be extended for
use by non-keyboard oriented individuals. One way this
problem has been approached is to employ a keyboardless
entry system, such as a touch screen. However, conventional
input devices of this type do not easily allow accurate
detailed input within a real time framework with high
resolution in a manner which is familiar and natural to the
user.A known type of keyboardless input system uses
handwriting recognition to enter handwritten text 
characters, as described, for example, in United States
Patent US-A-3,487,731 (Frank).US Patent No. 4,491,960 to Brown shows a handwritten
symbol recognition system in which an array of image Points,
in the form of a raster line sampling, is converted into
segment-oriented lists which are filtered and compressed to
obtain topologic features which are then analysed with a
logic tree decision mechanism.US Patent No 4,262,281 to Buckle et al. discloses a
handwriting recognition device. The disclosed embodiment is
for use with a host computer and does not employ coincident
display technology.US Patent No. 4,475,239 to Van Raamsdonk discloses
a text editing apparatus. The '239 patent calls for the use
of paper as a medium for the entering of editing functions
and requires a conventional keyboard for the inputting of
text.US Patent 4,521,909 to Wang shows a dual level

<CLAIMS>
A method for entering one or more handwritten symbol(s) into a computer
system, including the steps of;


creating, in response to a predetermined command, a window in at least a
portion of a display area (24) of a display screen (18, 20) for the entry of the one or

more handwritten symbol(s);
using a hand-held means (16) to write or draw the one or more handwritten
symbol(s) in the window ;
digitising signals representative of the one or more handwritten symbol(s); and
entering the digitised signals into the computer system (14).
A method according to claim 1, further including displaying the image of the
or each handwritten symbol on the screen as it is written.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, in which the one or more handwritten
symbol(s) comprise(s) a number, a letter, a Kanji symbol, a user-defined symbol, a

command or editing symbol, a graphic image or a drawing or the like.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, in which at least one of the one
or more handwritten symbol(s) is identified as corresponding to a font symbol, and the

corresponding font symbol is entered into the computer system.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 4, in which at least two handwritten
symbols are entered in the window.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 5, in which the predetermined
command in response to which the window is created is input as a handwritten symbol

by a user using the hand-held means.
A handwritten symbol recognition apparatus comprising:

a display screen (18,20); 
a hand-held means (16) for use by a user to write or draw a handwritten
symbol on or over at least a portion of the display screen;
a digitiser (18,64) for digitising the handwritten symbol;
a processor (14) coupled to the digitiser for determining the identity of the
handwritten symbol; and
a means coupled to the display screen for creating, in response to a
predetermined command, a window in at least a portion of a display area of the

display screen for the entry of one or more handwritten symbol(s) for recognition or
otherwise.
An apparatus according to claim 7, comprising a display means (14) coupled
to the digitiser and to the display screen for displaying on the display screen an image

of the or each handwritten symbol as it is written.
An apparatus according to claim 7 or 8, in which the window on the display

screen is usable as both:

(i) a window for entering one or more handwritten symbol(s)
during a first time period following execution of the predetermined command; and
(ii) a display area for displaying predetermined text during another
time period.
An apparatus according to any of claims 7 to 9, in which the window is
free of text and other information.
An apparatus according to any of claims 7 to 10, in which the window
can be of various sizes and shapes.
An apparatus according to any of claims 7 to 11, in which the one or
more handwritten symbol(s) comprise(s) a number, a letter, a Kanji symbol, a user-defined

symbol, a command or editing symbol, a graphic image or a drawing or the
like. 
An apparatus according to any of claims 7 to 12, in which a document
for editing by insertion of a symbol is displayed on the display screen, the window is

created near to the portion of the displayed document where the symbol is to be
inserted, and the symbol is entered by being written or drawn in the window by a user

using the hand-held means.

handwritten symbols are entered in the window area.
An apparatus according to any of claims 7 to 14, in which a soft key may
