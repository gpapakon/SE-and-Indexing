<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing an oxide thin film which has a crystalline, 
clean and smooth surface on a substrate. The process is conducted by 

using an apparatus comprising a vacuum chamber in which an oxidizing 
gas of O₂ including O₃ can be supplied near the substrate so that pressure 

around the substrate can be increased while maintaining high vacuum near 
an evaporation source and Knudsen cell evaporation sources arranged in 

the vacuum chamber wherein the substrate is heated, molecular beam of 
constituent atoms of the oxide excluding oxygen are supplied from the K 

cell evaporation sources and an oxidizing gas is locally supplied to the 
vicinity of the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing oxide thin
films having excellent flatness and high crystallinity, and more
specifically to an improved MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) process so
called a reactive co-evaporation process particularly for preparing thin
films of oxide insulator or dielectric materials, which have clean and
smooth surfaces, high crystallinity and excellent properties.Oxide thin films have been widely used as insulating layers and
protective layers for semiconductor devices. Oxide thin films are also
used as insulating layers and barrier layers of superconducting devices
utilizing oxide superconductor materials which have been recently
advanced in study, for example, Y-Ba-Cu-O type oxide superconductor
having a critical temperature higher than 80 K, Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O type oxide
superconductor and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O type oxide superconductor having
critical temperatures higher than 100 K.Since interactions among superconducting particles, such as Cooper
pairs, through insulating layers are necessary for operating the
superconducting devices and to high breakdown voltage is required for 
the insulating layers of control electrodes, the oxide thin films utilized in
the superconducting devices should be more homogeneous and should
have higher crystallinity and smoother surfaces than that of a
semiconductor device.In addition, the superconducting devices often include stacked
structures formed of oxide superconductor thin films and
nonsuperconductor thin films. For example, a tunnel type Josephson
junction comprises a stacked structure of a first oxide superconductor
layer, an thin insulator layer and a second oxide superconductor layer
stacked in the named order.A superconducting field effect device, a candidate of realistic
three-terminal superconducting devices, has a superconducting channel
and a gate electrode formed on the superconducting channel through a
gate insulating layer. If a superconducting field effect device consists of a
superconducting channel of an oxide superconductor, it is necessary to
stack an oxide superconductor thin film, an insulator thin film and a
conductor film.In order to fabricate a superconducting multi-layer wiring structure
by using an oxide superconductor, oxide superconductor thin films and
insulator thin films should be alternately stacked.All of above superconducting devices and elements require high
quality thin films. Namely, oxide superconductor thin films and other
thin films preferably should have excellent properties originated by high
