<ABSTRACT>
A single mask (30,56,64,70) is used to form a tapered 
nozzle (48) in a polymer nozzle member (46) using laser 

ablation. In one embodiment of the mask, clear portions 
of the mask, corresponding to the nozzle pattern to be 

formed, each incorporate a variable-density dot pattern 

(36), where the opaque dots (36) act to partially shield 
the underlying polymer nozzle member from the laser 

energy. This partial shielding of the nozzle member under 
the dot pattern results in the nozzle member being ablated 

to less of a depth than where there is no shielding. By 
selecting the proper density of opaque dots around the 

peripheral portions of the mask openings, the central 
portion of each nozzle formed in the polymer nozzle member 

will be completely ablated through, and the peripheral 
portions of the nozzle will be only partially ablated 

through. By increasing the density of dots toward the 
periphery of each mask opening, the resulting nozzle may 

be formed to have any tapered shape. Other mask patterns 
are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to inkjet
printers and, more particularly, to the formation of
nozzles in a nozzle member for use with an inkjet printer.Thermal inkjet printers operate by rapidly heating a
small volume of ink and causing the ink to vaporize,
thereby ejecting a droplet of ink through an orifice to
strike a recording medium, such as a sheet of paper. When
a number of orifices are arranged in a pattern, the
properly sequenced ejection of ink from each orifice
causes characters or other images to be printed upon the
paper as the printhead is moved relative to the paper.In these printers, print quality depends upon the
physical characteristics of the orifices, or nozzles, in
the printhead. For example, the geometry of the nozzles
affects the size, shape, trajectory, and speed of the ink
drop ejected.Fig. 1 is a cross-section of a desirable type of
thermal inkjet printhead 8. Printhead 8 includes a nozzle
member 10, having a tapered nozzle 12. Affixed to a back
surface of nozzle member 10 is a barrier layer 14, which
channels liquid ink into a vaporization chamber 16.
Liquid ink within vaporization chamber 16 is vaporized by 
the energization of a thin film resistor 18 formed on the
surface of a semiconductor substrate 20, which causes a
droplet of ink 22 to be ejected from nozzle 12.Preferably, nozzle member 10 is formed of a polymer
material, and nozzle 12 is formed in nozzle member 10
using laser ablation. Nozzle member 10 can also be formed
of a photoresist material, where nozzle 12 is formed using
photolithographic techniques or other techniques.Tapered nozzles have many advantages over straight-bore
nozzles. A tapered nozzle increases the velocity of
an ejected ink droplet. Also, the wider bottom opening in
the nozzle member 10 allows for a greater alignment
tolerance between the nozzle member 10 and the thin film
resistor 18, without affecting the quality of print.
Additionally, a finer ink droplet is ejected, enabling
more precise printing. Other advantages exist.If nozzle 12 is to be formed using a laser, a tapered
nozzle 12 may be formed by changing the angle of nozzle
member 10 with respect to a masked laser beam during the
orifice forming process. Another technique may be to use
two or more masks for forming a single array of nozzles 12
where each mask would have a pattern corresponding to a
different nozzle diameter. Still another technique is to
defocus the laser beam during the orifice forming process.
