<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic clamping device for the axial restraint of rotational parts to be clamped, such as workpieces, tools or the like. The clamping device has a mounting arbor (2) with a basic body (3) which can be put on the arbor and in which an annular piston (7) is mounted in a floating manner. The annular piston (7) can be extended relative to the basic body (3) towards the piece (1) to be clamped via a self-contained hydraulic system and in the process firmly restrains the piece (1) to be clamped by means of a pressure element. Known embodiments are technically complicated and are disadvantageous due to their relatively large overall length. The invention creates a clamping device of the above type which is of simple construction, has an optimally short overall axial length, is easy to operate and in particular can be adjusted precisely so that concentricity errors during the set-up can be easily corrected. This is achieved by several compensating wedges (11) being provided as pressure element. The compensating wedges (11) are held on the annular piston (7) and can be set relative to the longitudinal axis (X) of the hydraulic clamping device.

A hydraulic clamping device for axial clamping of disc-or 
wave-shaped rotary clamped items (1) on a support 

spindle (2) by means of a basic section (3), attachable 
to the spindle (2) in which an annular piston (7) is 

floating, extendible by a closed hydraulic system in 
relation to the basic section (3) against the clamped 

item (1), thus firmly clamping the clamped piece (1) in 
axial direction, with a compression device being 

provided, having a wedge-shaped area arranged 
symmetrically to the longitudinal axis of the clamping 

device, being axially displaceable by means of radially 
mobile compensating screws and lockable in a required 

clamping position, wherein the compression device is 
formed by several compensating wedges (11) supported by 

an annular piston (7), adjustable in relation to the 
longitudinal axis (X) of the hydraulic clamping device. 
A clamping device according to Claim 1,
 
wherein individual compensating wedges (11) are 

arranged radially on an annular piston (7) facing the 
clamped item and including one radially adjustable 

compensating screw (10) each.  
 
A clamping device according to Claims 1 or 2,
 
whereby compensating wedges (11), being rectangular or 

circular in section, are radially adjustable and 
arranged in groove-shaped or circular supports (18) of 

the annular piston (7), with the supports (18) being 
adjusted to the section of compensating wedges (11). 
A clamping device according to Claims 1 to 4,
 
wherein each compensating wedge (11) is formed as a 

sleeve, including a shoulder (11') preferably arranged 
at the top as a wedge allocated to a relative shoulder 

(11''') on the basic section (3) in such a way that the 
clamping pressure (S)is activated on radial adjustment 

of the compensating screw (10), preferably during its 
radial motion to the axis (X) of the clamped item, with 

the compensating wedge (11) being supported against the 
basic section (3) in the required setting position. 
A clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the compensating wedge (11) includes an 

internal thread (10a) for guiding a compensating screw 
(10), with the bottom (10') of which in turn being 

supported against part (8') of the sleeve (8) in its 
radial end position. 
A clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the shoulder (11''') of the basic section (3) 

and the corresponding shoulder (11'') of the 
compensating wedge (11) and the respective radial are 

forming an acute angle α of 15° to 30°, preferably of 
20°.  

 
A clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
wherein the shoulder (11'') of the compensating wedge 

(11) is provided on the side of a wedge (11), facing 
the basic section (3). 
A clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
wherein a basic section (3) may be attached to a spindle 

(2), including a sleeve (8) and a biased radial flange 
(13), providing a support area (15) for an annular 

piston (7) and a support area (14) for a clamped item 
(1). 
A clamping device according to Claim 8,
 
wherein the sleeve (8) includes an external thread (17) 

for connection of a basic section (3), in addition to 
an internal thread (16) for fastening a clamped item 

(1). 
A clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
wherein the supports (18) for the compensating wedges 

(11) is an integral part of an annular axial projection 
of an annular piston (7). 
A clamping device according to Claim 10,
 
wherein the external areas (11b) of the compensating 

wedges (11) are forming contact areas for a matching 
area (15) of a biased plate flange (13), with the said 

compensating wedges (11) being of rectangular shape. 
A clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
wherein the side of the annular piston (7) facing the 

rotary clamped piece (1) is in direct contact with the 
rotary clamped item in order to eliminate an adapter.  

 
A clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
wherein a biased unit, preferably a biased split washer 

(25) is provided in axial direction to a clamped item 
(1) prior to compensating wedges (11) for automatically 

resetting the said compensating wedges. 
A clamping device according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
wherein approximately four to ten, preferably eight 

compensating wedges (11) with integral compensating 
screws are evenly distributed over the circumference of 

an annular piston (7).
