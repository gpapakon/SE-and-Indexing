<ABSTRACT>
A subband adaptive filter is disclosed that retains the computational and 
convergence speed advantages of subband processing while eliminating delay in the 

signal path. The technique has applications in active noise control where delay 
seriously limits cancellation performance and in acoustic echo cancellation where 

transmission delay specifications may limit the use of conventional subband designs. 
A reference signal (x(t)) and a residual error signal (e(t)) are each decompased into a 

plurality of subband signals, (y
o
...y
m
, e
o
...e
m
), and a set of adaptive weighting 
coefficients (w
O
...w
M
) is generated for each of these subbands by a conventional 
complex LMS (least-mean-squared) technique (in 20-0...20-M). These sets of 

subband weighting coefficients are then transformed into the frequency domain, (in 
22-0,...22-M), appropriately stacked and inverse transformed (in 24) back into the 

time domain to obtain wideband filter coefficients for a programmable filter (12). 
The reference signal, (x(t)), which is correlated with the disturbance signal to be 

eliminated, is filtered by this programmable filter (12) to produce a disturbance 
estimate signal d and(t) which may be subtracted (14) from the signal d(t)) containing the 

disturbance. The process iterates in order to minimize the residual error signal (e(t)) 
and thereby reduce the disturbance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of adaptive filtering
techniques and specifically to the use of such techniques for adaptive noise
cancellation.Adaptive filtering techniques are now in widespread use for a number of
applications such as adaptive arrays, adaptive line enhancement, adaptive modeling
and system identification, adaptive equalization, and adaptive noise cancellation,
including acoustic echo cancellation and active noise control.In particular, the adaptive noise cancellation problem typically involves
the generation of a signal which reflects an estimate of a disturbance (i.e., noise)
which is to be reduced or eliminated (i.e., cancelled) from a primary source signal.
Once determined, this estimate signal may then be subtracted from this primary
source signal to reduce the effect of the disturbance. Active noise control in
particular involves the generation of a secondary signal (e.g., sound) for the purpose
of counteracting the effect of a preexisting noise disturbance. Adaptive filtering
techniques are advantageously employed in the context of adaptive noise
cancellation because a source signal from which a disturbance has been partially
removed may be iteratively tested and processed to further reduce (e.g., minimize)
the presence of the disturbance (see e.g. the document WO-A-88 03341).Certain adaptive filtering applications involve adaptive filter lengths
with hundreds of taps. Examples of such applications include wideband active noise
control for complex mechanical structures and acoustic echo cancellation, both of
which are characterized by long impulse responses. The computational burden
associated with these long adaptive filters precludes their use for many low-cost
applications. In addition to computational complexity, adaptive filters with many
taps may also suffer from long convergence times, especially if the reference signal
spectrum has a large dynamic range.A technique that involves the use of subbands has been recently
exploited to address the above problems (see e.g. the document 1990 Int. Symposium on Circuits and Systems; 1-3/5190; New Orleans (US); pp. 279-282; E. HÃ¤nsler: "Adaptive Echo Compensation Applied to the Hands-Free Telephone Problem"). Processing the signals in subbands has a
twofold advantage. First, the computational burden is reduced by approximately the
number of subbands, since both the tap length and weight update rate can be
decimated in each subband. Second, faster convergence is possible because the
