<ABSTRACT>
A medical adhesive tape and a tape preparation 
comprising the medical adhesive tape containing percutaneous 

absorption-type drugs in a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 
are disclosed. The medical adhesive tape comprises a flexible 

support having formed on at least one surface thereof a 
hydrophobic pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, wherein when the 

pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is adhered to a bakelite 
plate, an initial shear modulus at applying a load of 50 g/cm² 

to a shearing direction is 1×10⁵ dyn/cm² or less and the 
permanent shearing strain occurring in the pressure-sensitive 

adhesive layer at removing the load after adding the load for 
30 minutes is 30% or less of the shearing strain at removing 

the load.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical adhesive
tape used for protecting a skin surface by adhering the same
onto the skin surface and also to a tape preparation for
continuously administering percutaneous absorption-type drugs
into a living body through the skin by incorporating the
percutaneous absorption-type drugs in a pressure-sensitive
adhesive layer of the medical adhesive tape.Various types each comprising a nonwoven fabric or a
plastic film having formed on one surface thereof a pressure-sensitive
adhesive layer are proposed as a medical adhesive
tape for protecting an injured portion of a skin surface and a
tape preparation for percutaneous absorption for administering
drugs into a living body through the skin surface. Usually,
the medical adhesive tape, etc., using such a pressure-sensitive
adhesive is required to have a skin adhesive force in
a certain extent for preventing the adhesive from falling off
from the skin surface to which the adhesive tape is applied.
However, as the skin adhesive force becomes larger, a physical
stimulative property at releasing the adhesive tape from a skin
surface becomes larger to cause a pain or the release of a
keratin layer at releasing the adhesive tape, whereby there is 
a possibility to give a pain to a user by giving an unnecessary
stimulation or injury to the skin surface.Accordingly, in the case of developing the medical
adhesive tapes and tape preparations which are applied to a
skin surface, the development of a material which has a good
tackiness or adhesion to a skin surface and an excellent skin
adhesive force which does not give a physical stimulation at
releasing it from a skin surface and does not injure the skin
surface has been desired.Thus, as a result of various investigations to overcome
the above problems, the inventors previously found that the
skin stimulative property could be greatly reduced by using a
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer which causes a specific shear
deformation when a shearing stress is applied, and proposed the
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer as described in JP-A-5-64460
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published
Japanese patent application").Thereafter, as a result of further investigations, the
inventors have found that by designing the pressure-sensitive
adhesive layer such that the layer has the creep characteristics
that the permanent strain formed in the pressure-sensitive
adhesive layer and the initial shear modulus at
applying a shearing stress to the pressure-sensitive adhesive
laye
