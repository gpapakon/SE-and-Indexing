<ABSTRACT>
A hierarchical communication network, in particular a management network, with a communication component (2A to 4C) is described whose use enables, inter alia, the monitoring of a transmission network from two operating stations (1A, 1B). The communication components (2A to 4C) used in each case have two interfaces with the higher hierarchical level and one interface for connections with a lower hierarchical level. The two interfaces of a communication component (2A to 4C) each have one assigned port. In variants of the communication components, one common port is assigned to at least two interfaces. A connection with communication components of a lower hierarchical level can be set up via each of these interfaces. Structures of management networks, which are enabled for the first time by the indicated communication components, are explained.
