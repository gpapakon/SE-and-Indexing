<ABSTRACT>
Aramids, which in the drawn state have high tensile strengths, tensile elongations, and tensile moduli, are made from units derived from p-phenylenediamine, terephthalic acid, a substituted terephthalic acid, and 4,4'-bibenzoic acid or 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid. The aramids are useful for ropes and composites.

<DESCRIPTION>
Aramid polymers whose fibers and films are drawable 
and after drawing possess a combination of very high 
tensile strength, tensile elongation and modulus, are 
provided. It is well known in the art that the essence of 
high fiber tensile strength and modulus is the 
capability of macromolecules, of adequately high 
molecular weight, to adopt a fully extended (rod-like) 
conformation and good parallelization (orientation) with 
respect to the fiber axis. With fairly stiff-chain 
para-aramids, exemplified by poly(p-phenyleneterephthalamide) 
(PPD-T), good orientation is accomplished 
by virtue of the ability of precursor liquid crystalline 
spinning solutions to become well oriented on extrusion 
through a spinneret and prior to coagulation. Fibers 
thus formed are not capable of significant draw-orientation, 
although modulus, and sometimes, to a 
lesser extent, tenacity may be improved by heat-treatment 
under tension, which is in effect a 
crystallization process. A second route to oriented 
aramid fibers of high strength and modulus is by choice 
of a semi-flexible composition such that, while it 
cannot form ordered, liquid crystalline solutions, an 
initially amorphous as-spun fiber may be very highly 
stretched at elevated temperature to bring the chains 
into good alignment. These are typically random 
copolymers which are non-crystalline in the drawn state. 
Random copolymers based on the corresponding diacid, 
3,4'-oxydibenzoic acid have been disclosed in a general  
 
way, e.g., as part of a large number of possibilities 
for combining certain cited monomers (Japanese Patent 
Application 78-143726), or as within the description of 
a generalized formula (H. Sasaki et al., U.S. Patent 
4,507,467). Such drawable copolymers generally do not 
have the capability for substantial crystallization, 
which is known, as cited earlier, to enhance orientation 
which is a major prerequisite for maximization of fiber 
strength. Herein are disclosed random copolymers based on 
terephthalic acid, mono- or dichloroterephthalic acid, 
4,4'-bibenzoic acid or 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic 
acid, and p-phenylenediamine (PPD), which upon drawing 
as spun fibers at high temperatures, or just heating as 
spun fibers under tension yields fibers with a 
combination of high tensile strength, high modulus, and 
relatively high elongation to break. U.S. Patent 4,698,414 discloses copolymers derived 
from terephthalic acid, 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic 
acid, and PPD. U.S. Patent 5,003,036 discloses polymers 
containing
