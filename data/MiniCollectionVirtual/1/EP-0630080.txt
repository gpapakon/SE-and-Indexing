<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly (10) is provided 
for interconnecting a modular phone plug with a printed 

circuit board (12). The connector assembly includes a 
housing having a forward mating end (14) and a rearward end 

(16). A plug-receiving socket (26) is formed in the 
forward mating end and is adapted to receive a modular 

phone plug. The rearward end is configured so that an edge 
(38) of a printed circuit board (12) can be inserted at a 

first angular orientation relative to the housing and then 
rotated to a second angular orientation. A plurality of 

terminals (18) are mounted in the housing. Each terminal 
includes a contact portion (20) at one end, a tail portion 

(22) at an opposite end and an intermediate portion (24) 
therebetween. The intermediate portion is anchored in the 

housing. The contact portion projects into the socket for 
engaging a contact of the modular phone plug. The tail 

portion is configured for engaging a contact pad on the 
printed circuit board with minimal contact force in the 

first angular orientation of the board and with 
considerable contact force in the second angular 

orientation of the board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an electrical
connector assembly for interconnecting a modular phone plug
with a printed circuit board.Modular phone plugs and receptacles are well
known in the telephone industry. The receptacles commonly
are called "jacks". A jack includes an insulating housing
having a plug-receiving socket. A plurality of terminals
are mounted in the housing, the terminals including contact
portions or springs extending diagonally rearwardly into
the socket for engaging contacts of a modular phone plug.These modular phone plugs and jacks have been
widely adopted as standard components in the telephone
industry, and they are being used in ever-increasing
applications with equipment other than telephone apparatus.
For example, data processing equipment may be installed
adjacent a telephone exchange, as well as small computers
and similar equipment. The use of modular phone jacks in
such related equipment usually requires that the jacks be
mounted on printed circuit boards. An example of such an
application is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,221,458, dated
September 9, 1980. In that patent, a modular phone jack is
mounted to a printed circuit board by mounting pegs, along
with solder tails of the jack terminals inserted into holes
in the printed circuit board. These types of applications
require considerable mounting forces in the context of the 
ever-increasing miniaturization of such jacks and their
very delicate terminals; see also US-A-4 647 136, which discloses a connector comprising a connector housing provided with a plug inserting opening which accepts the insertion of a plug as the front surface of the connector housing and a slit which accepts the insertion of a printed circuit board as the rear surface of the connector housing.This invention is directed to an improved modular
phone jack for interconnecting a modular phone plug to a
printed circuit board, with substantially zero
interconnecting forces on the jack terminals when the board
is initially inserted or coupled to the jack.An object, therefore, of the invention is to
provide a new and improved electrical connector assembly
for interconnecting a modular phone jack with a printed
circuit board.In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the
connector assembly includes housing means having a forward
mating end and a rearward end. A plug-receiving socket is
formed in the forward mating end and is adapted to receive
a modular phone plug. The rearward end of the

An electrical connector assembly (10) for
interconnecting a modular phone plug with a printed circuit

board (12), comprising:

housing means having a forward mating end (14)
and a rearward end (16), a plug-receiving socket (26)

formed in the forward mating end and adapted to receive a
modular phone plug, and the rearward end being configured

so that an edge (38) of a printed circuit board (12) can be
fully inserted with the printed circuit board at a first

angular orientation relative to the housing means and then
rotated to a second angular orientation; and
a plurality of terminals (18) mounted in the
housing means, each terminal including a contact portion

(20) at one end, a tail portion (22) at an opposite end and
an intermediate portion (24) therebetween, the intermediate

portion (24) being anchored in the housing means, the
contact portion (20) projecting into the socket (26) for

engaging a contact of the modular phone plug when inserted
into the socket, and the tail portion (22) being configured

for engaging a contact pad on the printed circuit board
(12) with minimal contact force in said first angular

orientation of the board and with considerable contact
force in said second angular orientation of the board.
An electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 1 wherein said contact portions (20) of the

terminals (18) extend from the forward end of the housing
means diagonally rearwardly into the socket (26).
An electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 1 wherein said tail portions (22) of the terminals 

(18) extend diagonally across a rear face (34) of the

forward end (16) of the housing means.
An electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 1, including latch means (44a) operatively

associated between the housing means and the printed
circuit board for securing the board against rotation from

said second angular orientation.
An electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 4, including second latch means (42a) operatively

associated between the housing means and the printed
circuit board for securing the board against pulling away

from the housing means when in said second angular
orientation.
An electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 5 wherein said housing means, including both said

latch means (42a, 44a), are integrally molded of dielectric
material.
An electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 1, including latch means (42a) operatively

associated between the housing means and the printed
circuit board for securing the board against pulling away

from the housing means when in said second angular
orientation.
An electrical connector assembly as set forth
in claim 7 wherein said housing means, including said latch

means (42a), are integrally molded of dielectric material.
