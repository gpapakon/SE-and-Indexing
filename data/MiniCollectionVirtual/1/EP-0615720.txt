<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive hand cleaning article comprises 
a substrate presenting an abrasive surface and being 

capable of absorbing and retaining a fluid, and a 
nonabrasive aqueous hand cleanser absorbed in the 

substrate, the hand cleanser comprising one or both of a 
solvent and a surfactant whereby cleansing action is 

achieved by the solvent or surfactant, and abrasive 
cleansing action is achieved by the abrasive surface of 

the substrate. The substrate can comprise a cloth-like 
towel. A plurality of such towels are provided in a 

continuous rolled cylinder which are housed in a 
selectively sealable, essentially airtight container. An 

opening in the lid of the container allows the user to 
remove individual towels which contain the appropriate 

amount of cleanser thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to cleaning
compositions, and, more particularly, to waterless hand
cleaners.Hand cleansing formulations typically contain a
surfactant that solubilizes or emulsifies the soils
present on the individual's skin or hands. These
formulations inherently have soil-cleansing limitations
when soil-emulsifiability or solvency alone is used as a
cleaning mechanism. When only surfactants in combination
with nonaggressive solvent cleansers are used in the
cleansing compositions, the cleaning power of the
composition may be inadequate when stubborn or embedded
soils are present. If the chemical formula is too
aggressive in terms of its solubilizing or emulsifying
power, skin can be harmed due to defatting of the natural
oils thereof, particularly when the cleanser is used
repeatedly.Many cleansing formulations which are currently
available in the marketplace also contain abrasive
particulates which mildly scour the skin surface to aid
in the removal of embedded soils. Some examples of the
abrasive particulates utilized are pumice, silica, and
diatomaceous earth. These formulations can be of a
"waterless" nature, a term indicating that water does not
have to be added during the hand cleansing process.
However, because this abrasive particulate is generally
insoluble, it must be flushed away with water after the
cleansing process to achieve residue-free hands, i.e.,
free of the fine abrasive particulate which would remain
on the skin if not rinsed away.After cleansing and rinsing, hands are often
dried with a towel or cloth instead of air-drying for
purposes such as speed and convenience, as well as to aid 
in mechanically removing any stubborn soils which remain
on the skin. However, using a towel or cloth without
using water to first rinse skin which has been cleaned
with an abrasive hand cleanser will not effectively
remove all residual abrasive materials from the skin.Nonabrasive waterless hand cleansers which are
currently commercially available have a gelatinous or
paste-like high viscosity consistency. These cleansers
often have both polar and nonpolar ingredients which are
blended together to achieve removal of a wide variety of
soils from the surface of the skin. The gelatinous
surfactant which affords this type of waterless cleanser
its gelatinous form also acts as a substrate to
essentially permanently bind the emulsion of cleansing
ingredients together. This gelatinous consistency has
been essential for waterless hand cleansers in the past
in order for them to achieve the

<CLAIMS>
An abrasive hand cleaning article comprising:

a substrate presenting two opposed surfaces;
an abrasive ingredient permanently attached to or an
integral part of one or both of the opposed surfaces; and,
absorbed in the substrate, a waterless hand cleanser
emulsion comprising water, an organic solvent capable of

solubilising greasy, oily soils, and a surfactant;
whereby cleansing action is achieved by the emulsion
and the abrasive ingredient.
An article according to claim 1, wherein the emulsion
comprises 2-40% by weight of the organic solvent; 2-20% by

weight of the surfactant; 60-95% by weight water;
and 0-8% by weight of inert ingredients.
An article according to claim 1, wherein the emulsion
comprises 1-20% by weight d-limonene; 1-20% by weight

mineral spirits; and 60-95% by weight water.
An article according to claim 3, wherein the emulsion
comprises 1-20% of a non-ionic surfactant.
An article according to claim 4, wherein the emulsion
comprises 2-20% by weight non-ionic surfactant; 0.11-1.0% by

weight bactericide; 0.1-0.5% by weight fungicide/
mildewcide; 0.5-5% by weight skin emollient; and 0.01-1% by

weight antioxidant.
An article according to claim 5, wherein the emulsion
comprises 9.5% by weight d-limonene; 4.7% by weight mineral

spirits; 77.1% by weight water; 7% by weight non-ionic
surfactant; 0.4% by weight bactericide; 0.2% by weight

fungicide/mildewcide; 1% by weight skin emollient; and 0.05% by
weight antioxidant.
An article according to any preceding claim, wherein
the substrate comprises a towel.
An article according to claim 7, wherein the towel
presents two abrasive surfaces. 
A continuous roll comprising a plurality of towels
according to claim 7 or claim 8, adjacent towels being

separable at a line of perforation therebetween.
A selectively sealable, essentially airtight container
having a hollow interior in which is housed a roll

according to claim 9, and having a lid comprising an
opening therein for receiving the towels therethrough, the

opening having a selectively closeable cap associated
therewith, whereby an individual towel can be removed from

the interior of the container through the opening, and
separated from the roll by tearing along a line of

perforation.
A method for preparing a hand cleaning container
according to claim 10, the method comprising: placing in

the container a continuous rolled cylinder of towels
according to claim 9,

adjacent towels being separated by a line of perforation,
and the towels being capable of absorbing and retaining

liquid; adding the emulsion in order to appropriately
moisten
 the towels with a predetermined amount of the
emulsion; and sealing the lid.
