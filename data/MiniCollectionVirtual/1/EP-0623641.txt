<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of a polyarylene sulfone by oxidation of a polyarylene thioether using hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid, where the reaction is carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of concentrated sulfuric acid and/or with the addition of equilibrium peracids. The reaction products are suitable for the production of high-temperature-resistant and highly chemicals-resistant mouldings.
