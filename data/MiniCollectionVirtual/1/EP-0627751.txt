<ABSTRACT>
Circuit breaker with insulation and blowing by gas with good dielectric properties, comprising, for each pole, at least one sealed insulating casing filled with the said gas under pressure, and containing a fixed assembly comprising a contact for the permanent current to pass and an arc contact, and a movable assembly actuated by an insulating rod linkage passing in a sealed way through a wall of the said casing, the said moving assembly further comprising a contact for the permanent current to pass, an arc contact, a blowing cylinder including a blowing piston, and a blowing nozzle, characterised in that the fixed (50, 51) and movable (14, 57, 60) arc contacts are produced in such a way that at least a portion of the latter are traversed by the current in the opposite direction of the arc current.
