<ABSTRACT>
A crane machine having a carriage (1) and a crane (2), 
projecting from the carriage (1), with an arm (3) and a scoop 

(4, 5) carried by the arm (3) for scooping and delivering bulk 
goods (6). The crane machine is provided with a conveyor track 

(7) extending from one end to the other end of the carriage 
(1). 
By depositing scooped bulk goods on the conveyor track 
(7) each time, instead of on the location where said bulk 

goods are to be dumped, and conveying them over the conveyor 
track (7) to that location, a considerably greater capacity 

for transferring bulk goods (6) can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a crane machine comprising a 
carriage and a crane projecting from the carriage, with an arm 
and at least one scoop, carried by the arm, for scooping and 
delivering bulk goods. Such crane machines have been generally known from 
practice for a long time. Such crane machines are employed for instance for 
transferring bulk goods, such as beets, from a pile into a 
container, such as a loading body of a truck. An advantage of 
this manner of loading is that it is universally applicable 
and requires no special provisions for storing the bulk goods 
to be transferred. However, a drawback of loading bulk goods in this manner 
is that it consumes much time. In general, this is all the 
more objectionable as loading does not only take up working 
time of the crane operator and machine time of the crane 
machine, but also working time of the driver of the vehicle to 
be loaded and operating time of that vehicle. The object of the invention is to provide a crane machine 
by means of which bulk goods dumped in any manner, for 
instance on the ground, can be transferred more rapidly into 
any container, such as the loading body of a truck. According to the present invention, this object is 
realized by fitting a crane machine of the type indicated in 
the first paragraph with a conveyor track extending from one 
end to the other end of the carriage.  With this crane machine, the bulk goods scooped by means 
of the scoop suspended from the arm need not each time be 
conveyed to the loading body over the entire distance by means 
of the arm. Instead, the crane can be positioned relative to 
the pile of bulk goods such that a first end of the conveyor 
track is proximal to that pile. Subsequently, the loading body 
can be moved under the second, opposite end of the conveyor 
track For the transfer of the bulk goods to the loading body 
it is now only required that the bulk goods scooped from the 
pile be brought close to the first end above the conveyor 
track, after which they can be deposited on the conveyor 
track. The bulk goods deposited are then conveyed to the 
loading body by the conveyor track, while the arm of the crane 
and the scoop can be operated for scooping a next amount of 
bulk goods. In this manner, the crane is capable of transferring the 
bulk goods to the loading body at a higher speed, without the 
necessity of setting strict requirements with regard to the 
storage of the bulk goods to be transferred and the relative 
positions of the bulk goods to be transferred
