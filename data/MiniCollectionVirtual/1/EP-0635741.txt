<ABSTRACT>
An interconnect substrate (116) having a surface (105) 
with a plurality of electrical tracings (115) disposed 

thereon. A photonic device (114) having a working portion 
(118) and having a contact (106) electrically coupled to one 

of the plurality of electrical tracings (115) disposed on 
the interconnect substrate (116). A molded optical portion 

(112) that encapsulates the photonic device (114) is formed. 
The molded optical portion (112) forms a surface (120). The 

surface (120) passes light between the photonic device (114) 
and an optical fiber (103). Alignment of optical fiber 103 is 

achieved by an alignment apparatus (117) that is formed in 
the molded optical portion (112).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to fabrication of
an optical device and, more particularly, to the fabrication
of an optoelectronic interface.This application is related to U. S. Patent have U. S.
Patent No. 5,265,184 issued on November 23, 1932; that bears
serial number 07/889,335, entitled MOLDED WAVEGUIDE AND
METHOD OF MAKING SAME, and was filed on May 28, 1992.At present, coupling of an optical fiber having a core
region to a photonic device is a difficult task that
typically is achieved by either a manual method or a semi-automatic
method. Generally, both the manual and the semi-automated
methods are complex, inefficient, and are not
suitable for high volume manufacturing.A major problem associated with the coupling of the
optical fiber to the photonic device is alignment of a
working portion of the photonic device to the core region of
the optical fiber. Moreover, it should be pointed out that
the working portion of the optical fiber generally is
required to be not only perpendicular, but also to be within
an area described by the working portion of the photonic
device so as to allow light that is either transmitted or
received by the photonic device to be efficiently and
effectively coupled to the core region of the optical fiber,
thus necessitating extremely tight or restrictive alignment
tolerances between the working portion of the photonic
device and the core region of the optical fiber.Presently, coupling of the working portion of the
photonic device and the core region of the optical fiber
typically is achieved by actively aligning both the photonic
device and the optical fiber. For example, with the
photonic device being a laser and with the optical fiber
having an optical detector coupled to one end of the optical 
fiber having an optical detector coupled to one end of the
optical fiber, the laser is activated and the other end is
carefully moved or adjusted until the core region of the
optical fiber is aligned to the working portion of the
laser so that a maximum amount of light is captured by the
core region of the optical fiber as indicated by the
photodetector. However, many problems arise by aligning
the photonic device and the core region of the optical
fiber by active alignment, such as being extremely labor
intensive, being costly, having a potential of poor
accuracy of the alignment, and the like. Further, if the
misalignment is severe enough, unsuitable product is
manufactured, thus increasing costs and reducing
manufacturing capacity. It should be understood that
