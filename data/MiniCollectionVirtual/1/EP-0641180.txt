<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved
thin floss brush product.
In particular this
invention is directed to an improved floss brush
made of a textured, high tenacity nylon yarn
which provides the scraping functions of a floss
under high tension and the brushing functions of
a yarn under low tension.Tooth decay and dental disease can be
caused by bacterial action resulting from the
formation of plaque about the teeth and/or the
entrapment of food particles between the teeth
and interstices therebetween. The removal of
plaque and entrapped food particles reduces the
incidence of caries, gingivitis, and mouth odors
as well as generally improving oral hygiene.
Conventional brushing has been found to be
inadequate for removing all entrapped food
particles and plaque. To supplement brushing,
dental flosses and tapes have been recommended.
The term "dental floss", as used herein, is
defined to include both dental flosses, dental
tapes and any similar article.To improve the effectiveness and
convenience of dental flosses, dental flosses
combining a thin "floss" portion and a thickened
"brush" portion, together with a threader have 
been developed. The brush portion, when drawn
between tooth surfaces, has been found to
provide an improved cleaning action which
removes materials left by the floss portion,
when used alone. The combination provides a
substantially superior cleaning action. Such a
device is described in U.S. Patent 4,008,727,
for example. The complexity of this product
requires that each floss segment be individually
manufactured and that the product be packaged as
bundles of the individual, separate floss
articles.A continuous yarn having brush
segments separated by thinner segments is
disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,008,727 and
4,142,538. However, products formed using
conventional textured nylon yarns and previously
developed manufacturing processes were not
satisfactory. Manufacture of brush floss
products of this type involves applying a
polymer solution to the yarn. The solvent is
then selectively evaporated from the thinned
segment portion while avoiding solvent
evaporation from the brush portion, the yarn
being maintained under high tension during this
procedure. The solvent in the brush portion is
then removed while the yarn is relaxed, that is,
under low or no tension. Thin yarn products of
most texturizing processes were found to be too
weak to be placed under the high tension
required for forming the desired thin section.
Furthermore, the polymer impregnated brush
portion did not regain its

A dental floss brush (2) made from a reverse twisted high
tenacity nylon yarn having a floss brush section (4)integral

with and extending between two thread sections (6,8)
characterized in that the two thread sections (6,8) have

diameters, in their relaxed state, of less than 2.5 mm, in
that the floss brush section (4) has a diameter of up to 4 mm

in its relaxed state and a diameter of from 1.7 to 3.0 mm under a
tension of 0.05 N, and in that the floss brush (4) has a

breaking strength of not less than 5 N.
A dental floss brush according to claim 1, characterized
in that the reverse twisted high tenacity nylon yarn has a

breaking strength of not less than 20 N.
A dental floss brush according to claim 1, characterized
in that the thread sections have diameters, in their relaxed

state, of less than 50 percent of the diameter of relaxed,
uncoated yarn from which they were formed; and the floss brush

section has, in its relaxed state, at least 100 percent of the
original diameter of relaxed uncoated yarn from which it was

formed.
A dental floss brush according to claim 1, characterized
in that each floss brush section has a diameter under a

tension of 0.05 N of at least 60 percent of relaxed uncoated
yarn from which it was formed.
A dental floss brush according to claim 1, characterized
in that the floss brush is coated with a low melting wax

composition.
