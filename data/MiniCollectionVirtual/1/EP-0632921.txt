<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium, such as a tape or a floppy disc, is made using a substrate of high modulus polybenzazole polymer film. Suitable films can be coagulated from anisotropic polybenzazole dopes. A continuous layer of magnetizable material is deposited upon the substrate at high temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLEXIBLE MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM CONTAINING POLYBENZAZOLE POLYMERSThe present invention relates to the art of flexible magnetic recording media, such as floppy disks and magnetic tapes.Flexible magnetic recording media typically contain a flexible polymer substrate and a magnetizable surface layer. Examples of common substrates include poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) polymers and poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) polymers (commercially sold as Teonex™ film by Teijin). In recent years, the best magnetizable surface layers have been made of a continuous thin layer of magnetizable material. Examples of common magnetizable materials include oxides of iron and/or chromium, metallic particles and ferrite compounds of barium, lead and strontium.Unfortunately, it is difficult to apply the magnetizable material to the substrate. Common substrates can be destroyed by the process conditions needed to directly apply the magnetic material to the substrate. Typically, the magnetic material must be applied using complex techniques or using adhesives. What are needed are new recording media in which a continuous magnetizable layer is adhered directly to the substrate by simple and ordinary methods.One aspect of the present invention is a flexible magnetic recording medium comprising:(a) a substrate; and(b) a magnetizable surface layer, that contains a continuous thin film of magnetizable material, characterized in that the substrate contains a polybenzazole polymer and the magnetizable su rf ace ad heres d i rectl y to the su bstrate .A second aspect of the present invention is a process to make a flexible magnetic recording medium comprising the step of contacting a flexible recording medium substrate that contains a polybenzazole polymer film which is stable up to at least 300CC with vapor or 

ions that deposit a magnetizable material on the substrate at a temperature of at least 300°C under conditions such thatthe magnetizable material is deposited on the substrate.The stability of the polybenzazole polymer is high enough thatthe magnetizable material can be applied by ordinary sputtering and vapor deposition techniques. The polybenzazole polymer can be selected to provide further advantages, such as high tensile strength, high tensile modulus, etc- The magnetic media can be used in an ordinary manner to record electronic data.The present invention relates to magnetic recording media. Each magnetic recording medium contains a substrate that has a film containing a polybenzazole polymer. (For purposes of
