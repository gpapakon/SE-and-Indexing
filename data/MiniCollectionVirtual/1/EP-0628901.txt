<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a power control apparatus
and method for converting electric power from a
power source into a desired power system and to a power
generation system using such apparatus and method. The
invention also relates to a power control apparatus and
method for efficiently extracting electric power from a
power source and to a power generation system using
such apparatus and method.Since a consciousness to the recent earth
environment is rising, a power generation system using
a wind power generation, a solar battery, or the like
as a safety and clean energy source is largely
expected. However, an output of the solar battery or
the like extremely fluctuates in dependence on
parameters such as insolation amount, atmospheric
temperature, operation point voltage, and the like.
Therefore, it is demanded to adjust a load when it is
seen from the solar battery and to always take out the
maximum electric power. For this purpose, various
kinds of apparatuses and methods have conventionally
been proposed. For example, in case of the solar 
battery, a method whereby meteorological conditions
which momently change are grasped and the operation
voltage is determined by using a monitor comprising an
auxiliary solar battery or a sensor which is provided
separately from a solar battery array and is used to
detect a light amount or a temperature, namely, what is
called an indirect method has been disclosed in JP-B-61-2206
or the like. On the other hand, a method
whereby such an auxiliary sensor is not used but an
operation point voltage or current of a solar battery
array is finely fluctuated and an electric power
fluctuation at that time is checked and an operation
voltage is determined, namely, what is called a direct
method has also been disclosed in JP-B-63-57807 or the
like. Hitherto, a power converter or the like has been
controlled by extracting the maximum output from the
solar battery by using the method as mentioned above.The above methods, however, have the following
problems.According to the indirect method, it is necessary
to use the monitor which is used to detect an
insolation amount or the like and comprises the sensor
or solar battery that is provided separately from the
solar battery array, and it is also necessary to
perfectly grasp the relations between the
meteorological conditions which were measured by the
monitor or the parameters indicative of the 
meteorological conditions and the operation point
voltage and power of the solar battery array to be
controlled. In order to
