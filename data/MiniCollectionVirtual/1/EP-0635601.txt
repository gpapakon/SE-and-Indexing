<ABSTRACT>
The shake unit according to the invention is used in particular for shaking the breast roll in the sheet-forming region of a paper machine. This mass (3) to be displaced is displaced by means of an actuating device (2) into a desired, essentially horizontally one-dimensional forced movement. In this arrangement, the counterforces are supported via a countermass (4). The actuating device contains a connecting element (1), which is of variable length, in particular of elastically variable length. By means of the oscillating motor (5) belonging to the actuating device (2), the whole system is excited and kept in motion as desired. Both the shaking frequency and the shaking stroke can be set. By means of the design according to the invention, virtually no oscillations are transmitted to the environment, in particular to the foundation.
