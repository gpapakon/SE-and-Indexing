<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) that binds selectively to phosphorylated 

histone H1 and not to nonphosphorylated histone H1 and 
its use. In one embodiment, the mAb of the present 

invention binds selectively to histone H1 phosphorylated 
at the 12D11 epitope as defined herein. 
In a second aspect, the present invention relates to 
a cell producing a monoclonal antibody which binds 

selectively to phosphorylated histone H1 and has been 
shown to distinguish between histone H1 phosphorylated at 

the 12D11 epitope and histone H1 nonphosphorylated at 
thi
s epitope. 
In another aspect, the present invention relates to 
a method for evaluating cells or tissue obtained from an 

individual for the presence of dedifferentiated (or 
nondifferentiated) cells. 
Kits are also the subject of the present invention 
and are suitable for practicing the method discussed 

above.

<DESCRIPTION>
Cancer can arise in any of an individual's tissues, 
originating from practically any cell type. Cancer has, 
indeed, been said to be unique to the individual. This 
great diversity among human cancers has confounded 
efforts to develop widely applicable, reliable methods to 
detect cancer in its early stages, and to develop 
effective therapeutic agents for cancer, despite 
intensive research and development efforts over many 
years. With time, the general view has emerged that 
cancer is the manifestation of a loss, at the cellular or 
subcellular level, of identity as normal cells or tissue. 
The great physical and biochemical differences among all 
the tissue types found within an individual have, 
however, restricted the development of agents that can 
detect this change to reagents that can be used only for 
a single (or a closely related group) of tissue types. A 
need exists for a cancer-detection agent of wide 
applicablity to the many types of tissue found within an 
individual, from which cancer may arise.  The present invention relates to a monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) that binds selectively to phosphorylated 
histone H1 and not to nonphosphorylated histone H1 and 
its use. In a first aspect, the invention relates to a mAb 
that distinguishes between phosphorylated histone H1 and 
nonphosphorylated histone H1. This is accomplished by 
employing a mAb that binds selectively to histone H1 that 
is phosphorylated at a specific site. The invention may 
also be practiced with a monoclonal antibody that binds 
selectively to histone H1 that is nonphosphorylated at 
the specific site. Preferably, selective binding is to 
histone H1 of human origin. In one embodiment, the mAb of the present invention 
binds selectively to histone H1 phosphorylated at the 
12D11 epitope as defined herein. It has been discovered 
that phosphorylation of histone H1 at this epitope 
diminishes in cells as differentiation progresses, and 
reaches a minimum coincident with the onset of terminal 
differentiation. Cells are said to have become 
terminally differentiated when they have acquired their 
final identity as normal cells of a particular tissue 
type (e.g., muscle, nerve, superficial cervical 
epithelium). These cells can no longer form tissue of 
another type, nor can they return to a less 
differentiated state. Moreover, the capacity for further 
growth (proliferation) is lost upon terminal 
differentiation. Certain types of normal tissue, 
however, retain sufficient proliferative capacity to 
allow for tissue
