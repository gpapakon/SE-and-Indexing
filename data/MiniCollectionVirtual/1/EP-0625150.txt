<DESCRIPTION>
 1, 3-Oxathiolane Nucleoside AnaloguesThe present invention relates to nucleoside analogues and their use in medicine. More specifically the invention is concerned with 1, 3-oxathiolane nucleoside analogues, pharmaceutial formulations thereof and the use thereof in the treatment of viral infections.The compound of formula (I)NH,
 also known as BCH-189 or NGPB-21 has been described as having antiviral activity in particular against the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV's), the causative agents of AIDS (5th Anti-Aids Conference, Montreal, Canada 5th-9th June 1989: Abstracts T.C.0.1 and M.C.P. 63; European Patent Application Publication No. 0382562). The compound of formula (I) is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of formulae (1-1) and (1-2) :-
 and was described and tested in the form of its racemate . The only compound currently approved for the treatment of conditions caused by HIV is 3' -azido-3' -deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine, B 509U) . However, this compound has a significant side-effect liability and thus either cannot be employed or, once employed, may have to be withdrawn in a significant number of patients. There is inSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

consequence a continuing need to provide compounds which are effective against HIV but with a concommitant significantly better therapeutic index.We have now found that, surprisingly, enantiomers of the compound of formula (I) are e uipotent against HIV but that one of the enantiomers ( the (-) -enantiomer) has considerably lower cytotoxicity than the other enantiomer. There is thus provided in a first aspect of the invention the (-) (or laevorotatory) enantiomer of the compound of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.The (-) enantiomer has the chemical name ( - ) -cis-4-Amino-l- (2- hydroxymeth l-1 , 3-oxathiolan-5-yl) - (1H) - pyrimidin-2-one (hereinafter compound (A) ) . It has the absolute stereochemistry of the compound of formula (1-1) which has the name (2R, cis) ) -4-amino- 1- (2-hydroxymethyl-l, 3-oxathiolan-5-yl) - (1H) -pyrimidin-2-one.Preferably Compound A is provided substantially free of the corresponding (+) -enantiomer, that is to say no more than about 5% w/w of the (+) - enantiomer, preferably no more than about 2%, in particular less than about 1% w/w is present.By "a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" is meant any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, of compound (A) or any other compound which, upon administration to the recipient, is capable of providing (directly or
