<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for ejecting components from an injection mould comprises a crank drive in a frame consisting of a traverse and two bars running parallel to the ejector pins and conducting the traverse to the tool clamping platen. The crank drive comprises at least one rotating disc driven by a motor and carrying an eccentrically mounted lever connected to a slide holding the ejector pins and moving along the bars. Pref. the rotating disc is servo-motor driven and drive is transmitted to the disc via a gear box and a coupling.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the ejection of injection mouldings from injection moulds, which has at
least one ejector pin (34) which by means of a crank mechanism is axially displaceable in a

bore which penetrates both the mould mounting plate (5) and that half (8) of an injection
mould which is arranged on the latter mould mounting plate (5), with the crank mechanism

(16, 18) being arranged in a frame which substantially comprises a cross member (2) and two
profiles (3, 4) which run parallel to the at least single ejector pin (34) and connect the cross

member (2) to the mould mounting plate (5) which bears the mould half (8), and with the
crank mechanism comprising at least one crank disk (18) which is rotatably mounted in the

frame and has a lever (16) which is eccentrically mounted thereon and acts upon a slide (9)
which is displaceably guided on the profiles (3, 4) and bears the ejector pin (34), and with the

crank disk (18) having available its own motor drive (29),

characterised in that

the crank mechanism comprises two crank disks (18) which are arranged parallel to one
another and are drivable in synchronous manner, and between which the lever (16) is mounted

which displaces the slide (9).
Apparatus according to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the crank mechanism (16, 18) is accommodated in a housing, with the crank disks (18) being
mounted in the housing walls (21).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that

the motor drive is a servomotor (29).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that

the transmission of power from the motor (29) to the crank disks (18) takes place by means of
a gear and a clutch (28).
