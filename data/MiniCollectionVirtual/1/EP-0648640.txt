<ABSTRACT>
A constant current wire crossing apparatus for overhead 
eletrically operated vehicles, wherein wires of opposite polarity 

are connected by insulators to a crossing unit, consisting 
of a conducting strip disposed on each insulator and appropriate 

switching circuitry such that a continuous source of power 
of correct polarity is available to a passing vehicle in any 

direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus employed at the intersection 
of two wires of opposite polarity in overhead electrically 
operated vehicle systems and more particularly relates to devices 
designed to prevent loss of power at such crossings. Electric trolley buses and similar vehicles obtain power from 
a pair of overhead electrical conducting wires, one positive 
and the other negative usually at a nominal direct current 
voltage of 600 volts. When a pair of wires diverges from the 
main path, a switch is installed which changes the path of 
the vehicle current collectors. In this switch one of the 
wires of one polarity must cross the other wire which is at 
the opposite polarity. To prevent a short circuit, insulators 
are placed in one of the wires which cross. If the current 
collectors take the direction through the switch that does 
not have the insulation, no interruption to current occurs. 
If the direction through the switch is the one with insulators, 
an interruption to current occurs and this is usually associated  
 
with arcing and burning as the trolley bus loses power. In 
some instances a trolley bus with insufficient speed can stop 
under the conventional crossing device, lose power and stall. 
The same consequences for operation through crossings exists 
as at switches. A variety of inventions addressing the difficulties encountered 
at these junctions are found in the prior art. For example 
U. S. patents 2,500,826, Hoover, discloses the use of short 
segments of standard trolley wire as replacement parts for 
crossovers; 2,727,102, Sawyer, describes a system for guiding 
vehicle current collectors past such crossings; and 2,802,072, 
Matthes, reveals a novel mechanical crossing assembly. U. S. patent 2,794,867 Sawyer, details a crossing device in 
which power of the correct polarity is applied to the intersection 
coupling or pan upon the approach of the vehicle. However 
in this invention no provision is made for the loss of power 
at the insulators which connect the overhead wires to the crossing 
unit. The invention disclosed herein provides a means by which power 
or current is always available to the vehicle at any point 
in the crossing. This is accomplished by the addition of an 
additional conducting strip along a portion of the insulators, 
means for powering such strips, and an improved switch for 
supplying power of the correct polarity to the crossing unit.  
 The invention is specified in independent claims 1 and 3. It 
may be summarized as a device for supplying
