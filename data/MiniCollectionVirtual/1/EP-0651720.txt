<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a filled package which exhibits a substantially colorless transparent appearance. The package is made of a substantially transparent container (10) which exhibits the tint of a first color. A substantially transparent liquid (11) which exhibits the tint of a second color which is different than the first color is housed in the container (10). The tint of the first color of the container (10) and the tint of the second color of the liquid (11) cooperate with one another such that the tinted container exhibits a substantially colorless transparent appearance when filled with the tinted liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substantially 
transparent, tinted container being filled with a substantially 
transparent, tinted liquid, and more particularly, to such a 
substantially transparent, tinted container that when filled with a 
substantially transparent, tinted liquid exhibits a substantially 
colorless transparent appearance. Many liquid products, such as liquid soaps, exhibit a 
color that is not particularly pleasing to the consumer, e.g., a 
milky white or yellow color. In order to provide a liquid soap that 
is visually pleasing to the consumer manufacturers often alter the 
appearance of the liquid soap or the container or both. Liquid soaps exhibiting colors not particularly pleasing 
to the consumer are often packaged in tinted, opaque plastic 
containers. The tinted, opaque plastic container provides a 
visually pleasing appearance to the consumer by covering or masking 
the not so pleasing liquid soap. Other liquid soap products are packaged in transparent, 
plastic containers. The liquid soap is heavily tinted so that the 
filled packaged exhibits the tint of the liquid soap. The heavily 
tinted liquid soap housed within the transparent, plastic container 
provides a visually pleasing appearance to the consumer. Another packaging alternative for liquid soap products is 
to provide a filled package that exhibits a colorless, transparent 
appearance. A colorless, transparent package provides a 
particularly pleasing appearance to the consumer. However, because 
liquid soaps often exhibit a yellowish appearance the liquid soap 
must be bleached or bleached and aged over an extended period of 
time to remove the unpleasing yellowish appearance prior to placing 
the liquid soap in a transparent, colorless container. Bleaching  
 
and aging of the liquid soap increases the cost of handling and 
storage which results in an overall increased cost to the consumer. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a filled package that exhibits a substantially colorless, 
transparent appearance. It is further an object of the present invention to 
provide a filled package that exhibits a substantially colorless, 
transparent appearance without subjecting the tinted liquid to be 
placed within the package to extensive processing or aging. It is further an object of the present invention to 
provide a filled package that exhibits a substantially colorless, 
transparent appearance at minimal costs. The present invention provides a filled package that 
exhibits a
