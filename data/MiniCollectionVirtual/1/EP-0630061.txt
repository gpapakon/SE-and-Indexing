<ABSTRACT>
Method of making a sheathed high-critical-temperature superconducting wire by the "powder in tube" method. According to the invention, prior to the introduction of a slab of compressed powder of superconducting material into a silver tube, this slab is subjected to a heat treatment such that the parasitic grains are resorbed. This results in easier drawing of the tube, and results in strands with a regular geometry being obtained, free of defects and consisting of filaments (30) of thickness 15 to 20  mu m, having a form factor higher than 60.

Method for the manufacture of an encased high critical 
temperature superconducting wire, a "powder in tube" method, 

comprising the following operations: 

filling a first silver tube with a rod of compressed high 
critical temperature superconducting powder and sealing the first 

tube under vacuum; 
drawing said tube through a wire-draw die to produce a single 
strand; 
forming a billet by providing a second silver tube with 
sections of said single strand and sealing said second tube under 

vacuum; 
drawing and/or rolling the billet to the dimensions desired for 
said wire; and
