<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical cables, and in particular 
to a twisted pair data bus cable that has areas of shielding and 
areas of non-shielding; and to a process for making the cable. In electrical systems where signals are transferred from one 
instrument to another, a data transfer wiring system known as a 
data bus wiring system may be used. Those complex systems depend on electronic instruments to 
determine a condition or a set of conditions, and then transmit 
information or receive signals about the information over 
electronic wiring. Such a system is found in "fly-by-wire" 
aircraft systems where instruments detect various conditions of the 
aircraft and process the information to control the flight of the 
aircraft. To transfer the various signals from one instrument to 
another, a data bus wiring system is used. A twisted pair of insulated conductors can be used as the data 
bus. However, while some areas along the length of the data bus 
must be unshielded so that "stub" cables to and from the 
instruments can be coupled to the bus, other areas along the bus 
must be shielded to prevent electrical signals from being radiated 
or from being subjected to outside noise. However, shielding 
causes a change in the size, weight, flexibility and electrical 
properties of the twisted pair data bus. For example, shielding 
lowers the impedance in that area of the cable and adversely 
affects performance of the system.  
 In this invention, a twisted pair cable data bus is provided 
which is small, lightweight, flexible and has substantially the 
same impedance in shielded areas as in unshielded areas. 
More specifically, this invention is a continuous cable 
consisting of a pair of insulated conductors twisted about one 
another, which has sections of the cable surrounded by metallic 
shielding, in which the sections surrounded by metallic shielding 
having a thicker insulation cross section than the sections not 
surrounded by metallic shielding, the thickness of the thicker 
insulation being such that the impedance of the sections surrounded 
by metallic shielding is substantially the same as the section not 
surrounded by metallic shielding. Figure 1 depicts a cross section of a portion of the cable of 
the invention that contains shielding and added insulation. Figure 2 depicts a cross section of the cable of the invention 
that has no shielding or extra insulation. Figure 3 depicts a perspective view of a twisted pair that has 
had extra insulation and shielding added in selected

<CLAIMS>
A continuous electrical cable consisting of a pair of 

insulated conductors (1), twisted about one another, which has sections 
of the cable surrounded by metallic shielding (4), in which the 

sections surrounded by metallic shielding having a thicker 
insulation cross section than the sections not surrounded by 

metallic shielding, the thickness of the thicker insulation (3) being 
such that the impedance of the sections surrounded by metallic 

shielding is substantially the same as the section not surrounded 
by metallic shielding. 
Process for preparing the electrical cable of Claim 1 
which comprises, in sequence: 


a) applying insulation (2) to conductor wire (1), 
b) applying additional insulation (3) to selected areas of 
the insulated conductor wire, 
c) twisting two such insulated conductor wires around 
each other, 
d) applying metallic shielding (4) over said selected 
areas, 
e) applying protective jacketing (5) over said metallic 
shielding.
