<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for covering an
armature, such as a toilet seat, with a measured length of a
flexible sleeve.The prior art, exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 4,766,618 of
August 30, 1988 to the present inventor, discloses mechanisms by
which a toilet seat or similar armature-like structure may be
covered by a flexible sleeve or cover, such as to improve the
sanitary condition thereof. In particular, the prior art discloses
a variety of mechanisms for loading a length of protective sleeve
on a toilet seat from a first source and then collecting the used
section of sleeve in a collection box or mandrel, while
simultaneously dispensing a new length of sleeve onto the seat.
Such lengths are typically continuous elements of an extended
length roll of the sleeve material.Such prior art, however, suffers from deficiencies in
accurately monitoring the length of sleeve to be dispensed. Such
mechanisms also often twist the sleeve, which subjects the
mechanism to jamming.In addition, the prior art provides little protection against
misuse of the apparatus. For example, it is often possible to
cause subsequent lengths of sleeve to be dispensed without
intervening usage, thus leading to product waste. In addition,
devices of the prior art fail to include appropriate safeguards to
prevent operation of the drive mechanisms in the event of jamming,
loss of sleeve material and the like. Without proper protection
automated advance mechanisms may operate continuously.It is accordingly a purpose of the present invention to
provide a new and improved mechanism for the dispensation of a
tube-like sleeve material along an armature, such as a toilet seat,
in a manner which provides for precise control over the length of
sleeve dispensed.Yet another purpose of the present invention is to provide
such an apparatus having improved safeguards against malfunctions
and improper operation. Still another purpose of the present invention is to provide
such an apparatus which substantially eliminates jamming, and which
provides for a smooth feed of the sleeve material onto the seat. A further prior art, the US -A- 4,213,212 of July 22,
1980 issued to B. and A. Hefty, describes a tubular toilet
seat cover which is stored on a reel and pulled off from this
reel as it is replaced, and the used cover is taken up on
another reel. By actuating a drive mechanism, the cover is
moved through a predetermined distance determined by the size
of drive gears in such manner that when it is in the mounted
position, the toilet

<CLAIMS>
A toilet seat apparatus of the type having a horseshoe
configuration (16) having first and second ends (18, 20)

to be supplied with a length of a tubular cover material
forming a portion of a continuous length of such cover

material (28) mounted upon and supplied from a cover
supply reel assembly (38) and collected by a takeup reel

assembly (44) by drive means (58) operatively connected
to said cover supply and takeup reel assembly for

dispensing fresh cover material to be arranged along the
length of the seat and about its surface and for the

take-up of used cover material by the takeup assembly
characterized by:


said continuous length of tubular cover material
having a plurality of marks (50) thereon dividing the

length thereof into equal segments;
sensor means (52) for sensing the passage of said each
of said marks past a fixed point along said seat and

generating a sensor signal in response thereto; and
control means (46) operatively connected to said
sensor and drive means for operating said drive means

in response to a start signal generated by starting
switch means (56) for a period associated with the

provision of a length of fresh cover material along
the length of the seat as determined by a count of the

signals generated by said sensor means.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said control means
comprise means for operating said drive means until a

predertermined number of said sensor signals are
received.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein saids marks are
located upon said cover material a length substantially

equal to the length of said seat, said predetermined
number of sensor signals being one. 
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said control means
further comprise a first timer (72) to halt operation of

said drive means in the event said predetermined number
of sensor signals are not received within a

predetermined time period from said start signal.
The apparatus of claim 2 or 4, wherein said control
means further comprise a second timer (84) to inhibit

operation of said drive means for a predetermined time
interval from the receipt of the last of said

predetermined number of sensor signals.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said switch means (56)
is manually-operated.
The apparatus of claim 6, wherein said switch means is a
momentary-contact switch.
The apparatus of claim 2 further comprising means (42)
located at the first end of said seat for guiding said

cover material onto said seat.
The apparatus of claim 8, wherein said guide means
comprise a horn projecting from said first end towards

said cover source at an angle thereto, a portion of said
first end adjacent said horn being of decreased width

from that of a majority of said seat.
The apparatus of claim 2 or 3, wherein said marking
means comprise a plurality of spaced longitudinal marks

on a contrasting background.
The apparatus of claim 10, wherein said marks are placed
on a portion of said tubular material embracing a lower

portion of said seat.
The apparatus of claim 1 or 10, wherein said sensor
comprises a opti-transistor. 
The apparatus of claim 10, wherein said drive means
further comprise means to clear said marks from a

sensing zone of said sensor in conjunction with the
stopping of said drive means.
The apparatus of claim 13, wherein said clearing means
comprise a motor and gear train assembly having

rotational inertia effects after motor shutoff.
