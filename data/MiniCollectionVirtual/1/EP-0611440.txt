<ABSTRACT>
An angular displacement sensor for limited angle applications (e.g. for sensing automotive throttle positions) comprising first (14) and second (16) relatively rotatable components arranged to confront each other axially; the first said component (14) providing a plurality of poles (14A, B, C) which are angularly disposed about the rotation axis and extend towards the second component, said poles (14A, B, C) having axes which extend in the same direction as the rotation axis. Some poles have windings (14A, B) while others (14B) provide flux return paths. The second component comprises an inductance affecting component (16) which overlies only some of the wound poles at any given time, the relative rotation varying the poles which are overlaid. The sensor includes means for providing output signal data related to the inductances of the excitation poles and thus related to the rotary configuration of the components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices comprising angular 
displacement sensors. EP-A-0,460,417 (which is prior art only in terms of 
Article 54(3) EPC, not having been published until after 
the priority date of the present application) concerns a 
sensor device having a component with a pair of 
concentric walls whose height varies, so that the 
relative rotational position affects the inductance of 
two coils mounted on the other two of three radially-disposed 
poles of an E-shaped core. EP-A-0,049,987 concerns a sensor device employing a 
transformer having a primary winding wound on a central 
bobbin. Radially outwardly of this there are three 
secondary coils on cores. The flux circuit thus extends 
radially from a secondary coil to the central coil. DE-A-4,102,478 discloses a sensor device having only 
a single coil, which is wound on the central hub of a 
first component. A second component provides a sector-shaped 
element which rotates over the axial face of the 
first component. More complex devices with plural coils 
are basically produced by 'doubling up' the single coil 
embodiment. Inductive brushless angle sensing principles are 
described in our patent specifications WO88/06716 and 
WO90/04152. The present invention concerns their 
adaptation to provide angle sensing means suitable for 
use within a device such as a torque motor or vehicle 
throttle actuator, preferably requiring little or no  
 
extension to the housings of such mechanisms. There are many applications in motion control 
systems in which shaft angle must be accurately measured 
and electrically transmitted. Embodiments of the 
invention may enable one to achieve this with utmost 
economy in manufacturing cost and space envelope. WO-A-90/04152 discloses various homopolar devices, 
including some limited angle rotary sensors. One such 
device has a part-ferromagnetic rotor circumferentially 
surrounding a stator which is divided into poles by axial 
slots. Coils are wound on poles defined by pairs of 
slots. Thus such a device is an angular displacement 
sensor comprising first and second relatively rotatable 
components; the first said component providing a 
plurality of poles which are angularly disposed about the 
rotation axis and extend towards the second component, 
said poles constituting excitation poles and return path 
poles; said excitation poles carrying winding coils; said 
second component comprising an inductance affecting 
component which is constructed and arranged so as to 
overlie only some of the excitation
