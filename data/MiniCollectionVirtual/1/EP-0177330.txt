<ABSTRACT>
An endovascular stent formed of stainless steel wire of 
0.018 inches diameter and arranged in a closed zig-zag 

pattern. The stent is compressed into a reduced size shape of 
an outer diameter which is many times smaller than its 

expanded shape. The stent is positioned in a passageway in 
the vascular system by means of a sheath while the stent is 

retained in the compressed reduced size shape. A flat-ended 
catheter is used through the sheath to hold the stent in place 

in the passageway while the sheath is withdrawn from the 
passageway allowing the stent to expand in the passageway 

into its expanded shape to hold the passageway open and 
enlarged. Other possible applications of the stent are in the 

respiratory, biliary and urinary tracts to reinforce collapsing 
structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stents. 
It is desirable 
in various situations that means be provided for expanding 
a constricted vessel portion or for maintaining an open 
passageway through a vessel portion. Such situations 
arise, for example, in conjunction with the disease known 
as arteriosclerosis as well as the growth of a tumor so as 
to restrict or stop flow of blood through a blood vessel. 
Dr. Charles Dotter et al. reported in 1969 on the 
experimental use of coiled stainless steel wire stents 
placed in the popliteal arteries of dogs. Although the 
coils exhibited long-term patency, narrowing of the lumen 
occurred within them and only small coils could be passed 
percutaneously. See Dotter CT et al., Transluminally-Placed 
Coilspring Endoarterial Tube Grafts, Invest. 
Radiol., 1969; 4:329-332¹. Recently, two laboratories 
reported on the use of a prosthesis constructed of a 
thermal shape memory alloy, nitinol, which is passed 
through a catheter. See Dotter CT et al., TransluminalExpandable Nitinol Coil Stent Grafting, Radiology, April, 
1983; 147:259-260², and Cragg A. et al., Nonsurgical 
Placement of Arterial Endoprostheses, Radiology, April, 
1983; 147:261-263³. Such stents can be complicated to 
use, requiring ice water or heated saline for placement. 
Also they have been found to produce luminal narrowing due 
to fibrin deposition on the stent wires. Other references which may have relevance to the 
present invention are the following U.S. patents: Sakura 
4,214,587; Alfidi 3,868,956; and Simon 4,425,908; and the 
Russian patent 978,821; also the following publications: 
C. Gianturco et al., A new vena cava filter: experimental 
animal evaluation, Radiology, December, 1980; 137: 
835-837⁴; and M. Simon et al., A Vena Cava Filter Using 
Thermal Shape Memory Alloy, Diagnostic Radiology, 
125:89-94, October 1977⁵. Still another reference 
publication is D. Maass et al., Radiology Follow-up of 
Transluminally Inserted Vascular Endoprostheses: An 
Experimental Study Using Expanding Sprials, Radiology, 
September, 1984; 152: 659-663. US-A-1672591 relates to a resilient nostril dilator 
formed from a single length of wire bent into a configuration 
consisting of a number of bends joined by straight sections. DE-C-150127 describes a dilator for the uterus consisting 
of a plurality of rods hinged together in a closed zig-zag 
configuration and expandible by an external actuating means. Objects of the invention are to provide a stent which 
is easy to place and use and that reduces flow defects,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stent (9) comprising a single length of wire 
formed into a closed zig-zag configuration consisting of 

an endless series of straight sections (12) joined by a 
plurality of bends (13), wherein the stent is resiliently 

depressible into a smaller first shape in which all of 
the straight sections are arranged side-by-side and 

closely adjacent one another for insertion into a 
passageway with the bends having a stress therein, and 

wherein the stent is resiliently expandable by release of 
said stress into a second shape in which all of the 

straight sections define a generally circular or 
cylindrical configuration for pressing against the wall 

of the passageway to maintain it open. 
In combination, the stent of Claim 1 and a tubular 
cartridge (15) having said stent (9) therein, said stent 

being resiliently depressed into said smaller first 
shape. 
The combination of Claim 2 additionally comprising a 
sheath (20) having a lumen therethrough, said sheath 

having an adapter recess arranged coaxially with said 
lumen and enlarged in size relative to said lumen, and 

flexible member (21) having a closed end and having an 
outer size sufficiently small to fit within said sheath  

 
yet sufficiently large to push said stent (9) out of said 

sheath. 
The stent of Claim 1 wherein said wire is stainless 
steel of 0.046 cm (0.018 inches) O.D. 
The stent of Claim 4 wherein said stent in its 
second shape is 5.5 cm long and 4 cm in diameter. 
The stent of Claim 4 wherein said stent in its 
second shape is 3.0 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter. 
The stent of Claim 4 wherein said bends are 
relatively sharp and are at a radius of no more than 0.2 

cm.
