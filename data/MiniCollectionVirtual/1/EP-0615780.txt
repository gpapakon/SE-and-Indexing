<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for the separation 
of protein-bound substances (PBS) and, if present, water-soluble 

substances from a protein-containing liquid (A), 
e.g. blood or plasma, containing said substances, by 

dialysis using a special semipermeable membrane and a 
dialysate liquid (B) by means of a protein having an 

acceptor function for the PBS from liquid (A). The membrane 
useful for this method has to provide a tunnel-like porous 

structure on the liquid (A) side and a port- and adsorption-structure 
on the dialysate liquid (B) side. One or both 

sides of the membrane, i.e. the protein-containing liquid 
(A) side and the dialysate liquid (B) side of the membrane, 

are coated with a protein having an acceptor function the 
PBS.

 
The PBS-containing dialysate liquid (B) obtained after 

dialysis may then be purified by passing it through a 
conventional dialyzer in order to remove water-soluble 

substances and then through a charcoal- and a resin-adsorbent 
in order to remove PBS from the acceptor protein 

molecules. The purified dialysate liquid (B) obtained 
containing the free acceptor protein molecules is then used 

again as dialysate liquid (B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to membranes and membrane transport processes, and in particular to an
effective method for the separation of undesired or potentially harmful protein-bound substances (PBS) and.
if present, water-soluble substances (low-molecular weight and middle-molecular weight substances) and/or
lipophilic substances, from a protein-containing liquid such as plasma and blood by dialysis using said
membranes.The separation of substances which are strongly bound to a valuable protein from that protein by
dialysis is impossible or at least accompanied with a number of difficulties. This is especially relevant if the
protein is contained in a complex mixture such as blood or plasma.In medicine separation techniques are widely accepted for the separation of hydrophilic toxins from
blood e.g. in end stage renal disease (ESRD, uremia). Today, maintenanced hemodialysis (HD) is the live-saving
long-term treatment of choice in ESRD patients if no kidney transplantation is available. However, the
removal of protein-bound or lipophilic toxins remains, at present, an unsolved problem in medicine.
Especially albumin-bound toxins (ABT) have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of different
exogenous and endogenous intoxications in patients.Thus ABTs such as butyric, valeric, caproic and caprylic acid, thyroxine and tryptophane, unconjugated
bilirubin, mercaptans, digoxin- like immunoreactive substances, benzodiazepine- like substances, aromatic
amino acids and phenols seem to be responsible for the induction of hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral
edema in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF).These substances are assumed to be at least partially responsible for lethal cerebral alterations seen in
FHF. Moreover, FHF is typically accompanied by coagulopathy, defective ventilation, hypoxemia, pulmonary
edema, electrolyte imbalance, acid-base disturbances, renal dysfunction, hypoglycemia, cardiac dysfunction,
sepsis, hemorrhage leading to multiorgan failure and death. The mortality has been on an unchanged
high level between 60 and 100 % since years. depending on e.g. the age of the patient and the stage of
encephalopathy at hospital entry.In chronic liver insufficiency the same group of ABTs accumulates due to the insufficient metabolism of
the liver in the blood and brain although the primary toxins may be different (e.g. ethanol). Therefore,
symptoms such as encephalopathy normally seen in FHF may occur in these patients, too, and acute
exacerbations mimicking the picture of FHF are seen
