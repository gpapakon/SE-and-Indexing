<ABSTRACT>
A device for hydrolysing starch- and/or sugar-containing raw materials, in particular mash or the like, has an arrangement for supplying the crushed raw materials to successive heat exchangers and a discharge arrangement for the finished product. The heat exchangers are designed as chambers (14) arranged above each other in a vertical column. The chambers (14) are provided with respective bottoms (14) and communicate with each other through overflow openings (16) arranged in their respective bottoms (12) for the raw materials to be hydrolysed. They contain stirring members (32) for mixing the raw materials.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for hydrolysing starch- and/or sugar-containing raw materials, in
particular mash, having a device for supplying the raw material to heat

exchangers connected in series and a discharge device for the finished product,
characterised in that the heat exchangers are in the form of chambers (14) with

bases (12), the chambers being arranged one above the other in a vertical
column, and being connected by overflow openings (16) in the respective base

(12) for the raw material which is to be hydrolysed, and having stirring members
(32) for mixing the raw material.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the overflow openings (16)
discharge into tubular nozzles (18) which project downwards from the respective

base (12) into the chamber connected downstream (14).
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the base (12) of each
chamber (14) is concave.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
each chamber (14) has a stirring member (32) which is fixed to a vertical drive

shaft (24) common to all the stirring members (32), which runs through the
overflow openings (16).
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in that the drive shaft (24) is
hollow and has spray nozzles to direct a cleaning and disinfecting fluid into the

empty chambers (14) when operation is stopped.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the overflow opening (16) of the lowest chamber (14) with the highest 

temperature level, discharges into a funnel-shaped delaying space for the
hydrolysed product.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the delaying space and the lowest chamber (14) with the highest temperature

level respectively are connected to an extraction pump (46) for the hydrolysed
product, the force pipe (54) of which pump leads upwards as a heat dissipator

(56) in countercurrent through the chambers (14) arranged on top of each other
and to a discharge pipe (60) for the finished product.
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in that a heating coil (62) with
external energy supply is arranged in the lowest chamber (14).
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a
supply pipe for gas (74) leads into the lowest chamber (14) for the formation of

air cushions (22) in the chambers (14).
