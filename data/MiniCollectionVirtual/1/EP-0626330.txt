<ABSTRACT>
A stacker assembly receives signatures. A jogger 
assembly engages signatures supported by the stacker 

assembly to align edge portions of the signatures. A 
turntable receives the signatures from the stacker assembly 

and rotates the signatures to offset relatively thick 
folded edge portions of the signatures. A conveyor 

assembly pushes a stack of signatures from the turntable to 
a tying station in a strapper assembly. The conveyor 

assembly presses a leading end portion of a stack of 
signatures against registration surfaces in the strapper 

assembly to position the main stack of signatures relative 
to the tying station. A pusher element presses against a 

trailing end of the stack of signatures to press a leading 
end of the stack of signatures against the registration 

surfaces in the strapper assembly and to ensure that the 
trailing edge portions of the signatures are aligned. The 

strapper assembly is operable to tie a band around the 
stack of signatures. The conveyor assembly is then 

operated to push the bound stack of signatures away from 
the strapper assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new and improved
apparatus for use in handling signatures and more
specifically to an apparatus which conveys stacks of
signatures from a platform.An apparatus which receives signatures, forms groups
or intermediate stacks of signatures and deposits the
intermediate stacks of signatures on a main stack of
signatures is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,068,567,
issued January 17, 1978 and entitled "Combined Ejector-Gate
Means for Rotatable Table of an Article Counter-Stacker". 
The apparatus disclosed in this patent includes a stacker
which receives newspapers. The newspapers are stacked on
cooperating pairs of upwardly angled blades carried on
endless chains. A stack supporting table is disposed
beneath the stacker and receives stacks of newspapers from
the stacker.The stack supporting table disposed beneath the
stacker of the apparatus disclosed in the aforementioned
U.S. Patent No. 4,068,567, is rotatable to offset
relatively thick folded edge portions of newspapers
received from the stacker. A pair of combination gate and
ejector mechanisms have bars which are moved by a pair of
chains to engage the ends of stacks of newspapers on the
turntable. The bars push the stack of newspapers onto
roller conveyors. Apparatus for use in forming stacks of
signatures is also disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,532,230;
3,599,807; 4,183,704; and 4,678,387.An apparatus for tying loose stacks of signatures is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,611,533 issued September 16,
1986 and entitled "Tying Apparatus". This apparatus
includes an inlet conveyor which receives signatures in a
lapped stream. The lapped stream of signatures is formed
into a loose stack and deposited at a central station in
the apparatus. A shuttle assembly sequentially moves loose
stacks of signatures from the central station to either a
right tying station or a left tying station. The loose
stacks of signatures are bound or tied at the tying 
stations by strapping machines. The bound or tied stacks
of signatures are then delivered to a receiving station. An apparatus for automatically tying stacks of essentially
flat materials is disclosed in FR-A-1 498 021. This
apparatus comprises a platform for supporting a stack of
flat articles, strapper means for tying a band around a
stack of flat articles disposed at a tying station in the

second pusher element being movable between an extended 

position in which said second pusher element extends 
outward for a first distance from said second carriage and 

a retracted position in which said second pusher element 
extends outward from said second carriage for a second 

distance which is less than the first distance which said 
second pusher element extends outward from said second 

 
carriage, second drive means for moving said second pusher 

element and said second carriage along said second rail in 
the first direction with said second pusher element in the 

extended position to move a second stack of signatures 
relative to said platform along the stack discharge path, 

said second pusher element being spaced from the first 
stack during movement of the first stack along the stack 

discharge path, said first pusher element being spaced from 
the second stack during movement of the second stack along 

the stack discharge path, said second drive means being 
operable to move said second pusher element and said second 

carriage in the second direction along said second rail
