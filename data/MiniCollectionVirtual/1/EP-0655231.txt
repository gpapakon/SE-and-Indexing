<ABSTRACT>
The rests (7) are of the point- or surface-type, and there can be a horizontal hinge spindle (5) at the top end of the height-adjustable vertical support (2), for a holder (6) accommodating the longer arms (8) of the L-shaped rests, these arms being parallel to the spindle. The rests slide in relation to each other in the holder, so that the distance between the free ends of the shorter arms is adjustable. Supporting portions for the head and neck are mounted at these free ends.
