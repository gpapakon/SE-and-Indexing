<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical card lock is disclosed which allows for simple, reliable operation. User cards (221) are engaged by a set of plates (360), which upon operating the lock assume a configuration for mating with a previously inserted combination card (244). The lock can be rekeyed by replacing the combination card (244).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mechanical lock system using cards.Increasingly, electronic card systems using magnetic or otherwise coded cards and
slide type readers have been used to replace mechanical locks. These are relatively
expensive, both in capital costs and in frequency of maintenance.One problem associated with key operated locks is the difficulty of re-keying the
lock. If a key is lost or stolen, a locksmith is required to provide a set of new keys and
alter all the common-keyed locks. Mechanical card locking systems are known from e.g.
United States Patent Specification No. 4,149,394 (Sornes), which utilise a card having
round holes therein. The card can be inserted into the lock, whereby biased ball bearings
are displaced. If the ball bearings are displaced in a predetermined manner, the lock can
be opened. A similar ring-operated lock is disclosed in United States Patent Specification
No. 4,338,805 to Nygren. These arrangements all subject the card to considerable wear,
and allow for operation from one side only. Further, they cannot be readily re-keyed, nor
do they allow for the use of a magnetic strip in addition to the mechanical mechanism.
Such arrangements only allow for one possible position for each ball or ring, and do not
allow for master keying hierarchies.United States Patent Specification No. 4,627,252 (Lo) discloses a card operated
lock using a set of plates arranged to directly receive a card with notches selectively
removed in the end. This lock is only operable from one side, and re-keying involves
rearranging the plates. The user card directly engages the lock mechanism. This
arrangement only allows for one possible position for each ball or ring, and does not
allow for master keying hierarchies.French Patent Specification No. 1,163,526 (Beaudelet) discloses a simple
mechanical lock arrangement comprising a series of spring loaded locking tumblers
which are capable of being displaced independently of one another in a plane
perpendicular to that in which the slide bolt is displaced. The mechanism is operable by
use of a key featuring a series of grooves of varying depths, with one groove provided for
each tumbler. Upon insertion of the key the tumblers undergo varying displacements,
with the correct combination of displacements leading to the unlocking of the mechanism.
However this mechanical lock arrangement does not allow for the re-keying of the lock
mechanism. United States Patent Specification No. 4,587,815 (Gil)
describes a lock for use with a sheet key having a

<CLAIMS>
A lock mechanism (15;220;300) operable using a user card
(10;221), the user card having a pattern of openings (11,12;222)

therethrough, and the lock mechanism comprising a plurality of
generally parallel plates (20;242;360) slidable relative to each

other, with at least some of the plates having projections
(22;209;309) for insertion through the openings (11,12;222) in

the user card, and means (25;245) for enabling release of the
mechanism (15;220;300), characterised in that a combination card

(40;244) corresponding to the user card (10;221) is provided to
define a combination profile, the openings in the user card are

in the form of slots (11,12;222), the means for enabling release
comprise means (25;245) for engaging a combination profile, and

in that after the user card (10;221) and the combination card
(40;244) are inserted in the mechanism, the mechanism is operable

to slide the plates (20;242;360) towards the user card in a
direction perpendicular to its plane and insert projections

(22;209;309) into respective slots (11,12;222), the lock
mechanism being releasable only if the user card (10;221) enables

the plates to be moved such that the means (25;245) for engaging
a combination profile are correctly positioned to engage the

profile defined by the combination card (40;244), and the
combination card being replaceable to re-key the lock mechanism.
A lock mechanism (15;220;300) according to Claim 1,
wherein the means for engaging a combination profile comprises

lugs (25;245) extending from at least some of the plates. 
A lock mechanism (15;220;300) according to Claim 1 or
Claim 2, wherein the combination profile is defined by a

plurality of slots (41;265) in the combination card (40;244).
A lock mechanism (220;300) according to any preceding
Claim wherein the projections (209;309) are formed such that

their respective depth of insertion into the user card (221)
depend on the length of the slot (222) in the user card (221)

through which the respective projection passes.
A lock mechanism (200;300) according to any preceding
Claim wherein the projections (209;309) are provided on one edge

of the plates (242;360) and the lugs (245) are provided on a
different edge of the plates.
A lock mechanism (220;300) according to Claim 5 wherein
the respective projections (209;309) may be provided on the one

edge of the plates (242;360) at different positions.
A lock mechanism (220;300) according to Claim 6 wherein
the plates (242;360) including projections are arranged such that

alternate plates (361,362) have projections (209;309) provided
towards opposite ends thereof.
A lock mechanism (300) according to any preceding Claim
comprising a plate assembly (350) and a lock plate (340)

comprising a combination assembly (301) for receiving the

combination card (244), such that if a user card (221) and

mechanism, the mechanism is operable to move the lock plate (340)
which in turn moves the combination assembly (301) via a spring

(345) and the lock plate is able to move to its unlocked
