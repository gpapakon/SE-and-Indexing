<ABSTRACT>
What is described is a constructive detail of a binding device for packaging goods, in which a band (10) for forming a closed band loop is inserted into a band-guide channel which consists of individual portions and which forms at least one curve extending in one plane. In order to guide the band (10) through the curve, even though it is to lie essentially in the curve plane at the entry and exit of the curve, it is proposed that a rotatably mounted roller (1) having a circumferential groove (2) be provided in the region of the curve. The circumferential groove (2) is covered by a stationary covering bow (3) matched to the curvature of the curve and, in this portion, forms with the covering bow (3) the band-guide channel. The roller (1) can be driven and preferably has a low moment of inertia. The circumferential groove (2) has a trapezoidal cross-section widening inwards and is at least as deep as the band (10) is wide. The roller (1) can be mounted with an oblique roller-bearing axis, be tiltable or be axially movable.
