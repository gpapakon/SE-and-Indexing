<ABSTRACT>
A constant-rate deflator for constantly reducing air
pressure of a cuff-type sphygmomanometer is disclosed. The

constant-rate deflator comprises a ventilation-adjusting
shaft 2 with a truncate-cone recess 2a formed in one of the end

thereof and a leak valve 1 with a hole 1b formed in the center
thereof, the leak valve having a projection 1c opposing the

recess of the ventilation-adjusting shaft and has the same
truncated cone shape as the recess, wherein the rate of

deflation is kept constant by adjusting the clearance between
the projection of the leak valve and the recess of the

ventilation-adjusting shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a constant-rate
deflator for a sphygmomanometer which reduces the air pressure
in the pressurized chamber at a constant rate by gradually
exhausting the high pressure air in the chamber.In a cuff-type sphygmomanometer, the blood pressure is
measured by identifying the pulsation phenomena (changes in the
pulse pressure and the blood flow) caused during deflation of
an inflated cuff. Therefore, a constant-rate deflator which
gradually decreases the air pressure in the cuff depressing the
arm, wrist, finger, and the like at a constant rate is used in
the cuff-type sphygmomanometer.Typical constant-rate deflators are proposed by Japanese
Utility Model Application Laid-open No. 115507/1986, Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No.193634/1986, and Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No. 193031/1991. These deflators
are provided with a cylindrical tube of which the bottom is made
from a flexible material such as rubber, with a slit being
provided in a part thereof. To control the pressure decrease,
the amount of opening of the slit is adjusted by providing a
pressure from inside this cylindrical tube or from a side
thereof by an indenter which is a component independent from
the cylindrical tube. Specifically, as shown in Figure 6, a typical
sphygmomanometer which is provided with a conventional
constant-rate deflator has a high pressure chamber 50 directly
joining with a cuff which depresses the arm, wrist, finger, and
the like. This high pressure chamber 50 has a base plate 51
and an upper plate 52. Formed on a side of the base plate 51
is a lateral hole 51a, with steps, which is connected to an
evacuation hole 60. A cylindrical ventilation valve 53 made
of rubber is secured to this lateral hole 51a.One or more slits 53a are provided at the circumferential
surface on the bottom side of the cylindrical ventilation valve
53 along the longitudinal direction. These slits 53a are
located in the high pressure chamber 50. On the other hand,
an opening of the cylindrical ventilation valve 53 is positioned
on the side of the ventilation hole 60 and secured by a securing
ring 54.Provided around the external circumference of the
securing ring 54 is a male screw 54a which threadedly engages
a female screw 60a formed around the internal circumference of
the evacuation hole 60. The female screw 54b formed around the
internal circumference is structured so as to be threadedly
engaged by a male screw 55a which is formed around the external
circumference of a head portion of an adjusting
