<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (20, 120, 220) is provided for controlling discharge of fuel vapors from a vehicle fuel tank having a filler neck. The apparatus (20, 120, 220) comprises a housing (24, 124, 224) defining an interior region (26, 126, 226), the housing being formed to include first and second inlet ports (28, 30, 128, 130, 228, 230), a signal port (32, 132, 232), and an outlet port (34, 134, 234). The apparatus further comprises a first valve assembly (44, 144, 244) movable between a blocking position preventing fuel vapor received from the first inlet port from flowing through the interior region during vehicle refueling and a venting position allowing fuel vapor received from the first inlet port to flow through the interior region to the outlet port during vehicle operation. A signal passageway (40, 140, 240) extends between the filler neck and the signal port to expose the first valve assembly to fuel vapor pressure from the filler neck to move the first valve assembly toward its venting position during vehicle operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for
controlling venting of fuel vapors from a vehicle fuel
tank. More particularly, the present invention relates
to systems including control valve assemblies for venting
fuel vapor from the fuel tank via a first vent path
during vehicle operation and for venting fuel vapor from
the fuel tank via a second vent path during vehicle
refueling.It is well understood that significant quantities of
fuel vapor can escape from a fuel tank through the filler
neck to the atmosphere during the refueling of motor
vehicles. Early attempts to control the vapor escape
focused upon control devices fitted to the fuel
dispensing nozzle. Later, control devices mounted
directly on-board the vehicle (and thus referred to as
"on-board vapor recovery" systems or "OBVR" systems) were
developed. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,836,835,
relating to a vacuum-actuated vapor recovery system
mounted on the fuel tank filler neck. OBVR systems which
mount to the fuel tank have also been developed.In addition to controlling vapor escape, well-designed
OBVR systems also assist in controlling the
amount of liquid fuel which can be pumped into the fuel
tank during refueling. For safety reasons, fuel systems
are designed so that the fuel tank is never completely
filled with liquid fuel. Rather, at least a
predetermined portion of the fuel tank is left for liquid
fuel and fuel vapor expansion. Although fuel pump
nozzles typically include sensors for shutting off the
flow of liquid fuel into the fuel tank when the fuel tank
is nearly filled, fuel pump users may manually override
the sensors by continuing to pump fuel after the sensors 
have automatically shut the pump nozzle off. To assist
in preventing tank overfill under such conditions, the
OBVR system is usually provided with a fill-limit valve
which prevents the escape of vapor through the OBVR
system, and thus assists in triggering the nozzle shutoff
mechanism, when the level of liquid fuel in the fuel
tank has risen to a predetermined level.It has also long been recognized that fuel vapor is
generated in the fuel tank during operation of the
vehicle, for example, by evaporation or by sloshing of
the liquid fuel against the walls of the tank. Excessive
pressure can build up in the fuel tank as a result of the
newly-formed fuel vapor unless control devices are
provided to vent the fuel vapor from the fuel tank during
vehicle operation. Such valves have been referred to as
"run-loss" valves or tank venting rollover valves because
they handle
