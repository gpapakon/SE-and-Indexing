<ABSTRACT>
Light processing apparatus creates a number of visual effects which simulate movement with light from a light source. A multiplicity of flexible fibre optic light guides having optically finished input and output ends are grouped into groups, with each group being assigned to create a particular effect. The input ends of each group of light guides are placed in adjacent receptor zones of pre-selected geometry, and the output ends of each group of light guides are located on an effects surface in a pre-selected pattern. Light from the light source is filtered by a colour changer having a plurality of discrete moveable coloured filter zones shaped to correlate with the receptor zones, and is then received by the input ends of the light guides and distributed to the ouptut ends of the light guides. The colour changer may be a rotatable colour wheel filter, an endless band filter or a cylindrical filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
application Serial No. 079,585 filed on June 22, 1993. The present invention relates to light 
processing apparatus for creating visual effects with 
light from a light source, and to signs, display panels 
and other lighting products utilizing such processing 
apparatus. Various conventional decorative or display 
lighting devices utilize fibre optics or light guides. 
Typically, white light from a light source is passed 
through a colour wheel onto the circular common end of a 
harness of fibre optic light guides. The output ends or 
"tails" of the fibre optic light guides are then 
positioned on a display surface such as a sign in a pre-selected 
pattern to create a desired visual effect. The 
colour wheel may be rotated through a sequence of colours 
so as to create an end effect which simulates movement and 
flow. Existing decorative lighting devices suffer 
from a number of drawbacks, including uneven illumination. 
When the colour wheel is rotated, a colour front initially 
illuminates only a few of the light fibres situated at the 
edge of the common end. As the colour front moves across 
the surface of the common end, an increasing number of 
light fibres are illuminated, but as the colour wheel 
continues its movement, fewer light fibres are 
illuminated. The net result is disproportionate 
illumination and uneven colour flow. Another problem with 
conventional lighting systems is the risk of heat damage  
 
to colour wheels caused by high intensity focused light, 
including discoloration, distortion and disintegration. 
This problem can be avoided by using colour wheels made 
from relatively robust and expensive materials such as 
glass, but glass colour wheels are heavy and require 
larger drive motors. Standard colour wheels are also 
incapable of utilizing the full spectrum of colour 
combinations. Furthermore, conventional systems are 
inefficient in that they do not facilitate the sequencing 
of fibre optic strands into pre-determined positions to 
create a desired end effect. There is accordingly a need for a low cost 
light processing system which overcomes the problems 
associated with the prior art. GB-A-2073930 describes a light transmission system 
comprising, in sequence, a light source, a collection and 
distribution device composed of optic fibres, an electro-optical 
variable transmission device, a second collection 
and distribution device also composed of optic fibres and a 
display device. WO-A-8703408 describes an animated
