<ABSTRACT>
An object of the invention is to display target data in modes different from one another. Such an arrangement is adopted 
that a multi-color display section (1) capable of displaying in at least two colors is provided, and a color and a state (on/off) of a 

light are selected in accordance with examination and treatment data to be displayed. According to the present invention, by use 
of the combinations of a color and a state of the light, various data can be displayed in modes different from one another, so that 

displayed meanings and details can be identified at a glance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the improvement of a display device 
which displays data necessary for diagnosis and treatment in a medical 
diagnosis and treatment system. Various types of medical diagnosis and treatment systems are 
provided with a display unit which is composed of monochrome display 
elements such as LEDs; for example, in the case of the pulse oximeter, 
display is performed in different modes, so that if the measured oxygen 
saturation level of the patient is normal, the display element is 
continuously illuminated while the measured value is displayed, and if 
it deviates from the normal range, the measured value is displayed while 
the display element flashes. Also, when the settings of the normal 
range are changed, the inputted setting values are displayed, but since 
these values are either steadily illuminated or flash, it is difficult 
to distinguish them clearly from the display when the values are normal 
or abnormal, resulting in the problem that the possibility of mistaken 
reading is high. The present invention was developed in light of these problems, and 
has the purpose of offering a display device for a medical diagnosis and 
treatment system which allows the confirmation of contents or status to 
be displayed in accordance with these contents or status. The present invention offers a medical diagnosis and treatment 
system display device which is provided with a multicolor display unit 
by which display can be performed in at least 2 colors and a control 
unit which along with determining whether display is to be performed by 
continuous illumination or by flashing, in accordance with the 
diagnostic or therapeutic data to be displayed, displays the diagnostic 
or therapeutic data by driving the aforesaid multicolor display unit. By means of the present invention, multiple types of data can be 
displayed in accordance with the type of color used in a continuous 
illumination mode, and by adding flashing to this the amount of data 
which can be displayed is doubled, so that various types of data can be 
displayed in respectively differing modes. For example, when the 
multicolor display unit consists of 2 colors, by the combination of 
display color and steady illumination or flashing display can be 
performed in 4 modes, so that the 3 statuses of normal and abnormal 
diagnostic and therapeutic data and setting adjustment values can be 
easily displayed in differing display modes. Figure 1 is a block diagram of the medical diagnosis and treatment  
 
system provided
