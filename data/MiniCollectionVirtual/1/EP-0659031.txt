<ABSTRACT>
According to the prior art, it is known to connect diaphragms (11) of cone loudspeakers to the loudspeaker frame (10) by means of so-called beads (13). Such beads (13) are predominantly formed from plastic or rubber and are connected to the diaphragm (11) and to the loudspeaker frame (10) by using suitable adhesives. This type of connection restricts the free choice of material of the abovementioned components because not all elastic bead materials can be connected to the diaphragm (11) with the required mechanical stability. The selection of material is restricted further if the loudspeaker is exposed to environmental temperatures of greater than 100 DEG C because the adhesive connections lose their strength under these conditions. This is why the invention is based on the object of specifying a high-strength suspension for diaphragms of cone loudspeakers. This object is achieved by the fact that the beads (13) are formed from an injectable high-temperature-resistant elastomer (silicone or fluoroelastomer) and that the inner edge (18) of the bead (13) is connected to the upper edge (19) of the diaphragm (11) by being vulcanised. Especially strong connections of diaphragm (11) and bead (13) are given when the upper edge (19) of the diaphragm (11) has penetrations (20) and the areas of the inner edge (18) arranged on both sides of the diaphragm (11) are connected to the bead material through the penetrations (20) in the diaphragm (11).

Suspension for cone-type loudspeakers, having a diaphragm
(11), a loudspeaker frame (10) and a bead (13) formed

from an elastomer resistant to high temperatures, whose
outer edge (14) is joined to the loudspeaker frame (10)

and whose inner edge (18) is joined to the upper edge
(19) of the diaphragm (11), the upper edge (19) of the

diaphragm (11) being encapsulated with the bead material,

characterised in that
 the upper edge (19) of the
diaphragm (11) has a continuous perforation whose

openings (20) are filled with the bead material following
encapsulation, so that the areas of bead material coating

the upper edge (19) of the diaphragm (11) on both sides
are interconnected through the openings (20 in the

diaphragm (11).
Suspension according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the diaphragm (11) is formed from metal.
Suspension according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the upper edge (14) of the bead (13) is joined to the
loudspeaker frame (10), so that the outer edge (14) of

the bead (13) is clamped between a circular face (12) of
the loudspeaker frame (10) serving as a support for the

bead (13) on the loudspeaker frame (10), and a continuous
ring (15).
Suspension according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the outer edge (14) of the bead (13) has a continuous
ring (15'), at least one of whose circular faces is

encapsulated with bead material, and that in the bonded
state of the bead (13) and the loudspeaker frame (10),

the circular face of the continuous ring coated with bead
material is pressed against a circular face (12) of the

loudspeaker frame (10) serving as a support for the bead
(13) on the loudspeaker frame (10). 
Suspension according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the elastomer from which the bead
(13) is formed is a silicone rubber.
Suspension according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the elastomer from which the bead
(13) is formed is a fluoroelastomer.
Suspension according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the areas of the diaphragm (11) which are coated with the
bead material have a coupling agent between the bead

material and the diaphragm (11).
Suspension according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that

the areas of the continuous ring (15') which are coated
with the bead material have a coupling agent between the

bead material and the continuous ring (15').
