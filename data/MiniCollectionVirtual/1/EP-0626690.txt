<ABSTRACT>
A digital audio disk player having no space 
interface between two reproduced consecutive music 

numbers in a scan play. In a digital audio disk player 
capable of performing a scan player by reproducing a 

music number starting from a searched center thereof, a 
memory control unit constituted by a microprocessor 

controls a memory controller during the scan play so that 
digital audio data is written into a memory 8 at a speed 

equal to or higher than a speed corresponding to a normal 
reproducing speed, and read therefrom at a speed 

corresponding to the normal reproducing speed. The 
memory control unit controls to start the search of the 

center position of a succeeding music number before the 
completion of reproducing the preceding music number to 

that the search of the center position of the succeeding 
music number completes when the reproduction of the 

preceding music number completes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a digital audio
disk player, and more particularly to a digital audio
disk player capable of outputting audio data without
intermitting it in a scan play.In this specification, the term "scan play" means to
sequentially reproduce music numbers each being faded in
at the center position thereof and faded out after a
predetermined time period, e.g., after 20 seconds.In the scan play of a conventional digital audio
disk player, the center position of a music number is
detected from music number position information recorded
on a digital audio disk and the music number is
reproduced for 20 seconds starting from the center
thereof. Reproducing a music number continues during the
time period from a fade-in to a fade-out, and the next
music number is reproduced by searching the center
position thereof. Such reproduction is repeated while
the scan play is instructed. As shown in Fig.3A, in the scan play of a
conventional digital audio disk player, there is a space
interval of several seconds between the reproduced two
consecutive music numbers because it takes a time to
search the center position of the succeeding music
number. EP-A-0 419 009 discloses an example of such a disk player.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a digital audio disk player capable of removing the space
interval between reproduced two consecutive music numbers
in the scan play.According to one aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a digital audio disk player with a scan
play function for reproducing each music number during a
predetermined time period starting from a searched center
of the music number, the digital audio disk player
including: storage means for storing processed digital
audio data; read/write control means responsive to a scan
play instruction for writing the digital audio data of
each music number starting from a searched center into
the storage means at a speed higher than the
normal reproducing speed, and
for reading the digital audio data of the music number
starting from the searched center from the storage means 
at a speed corresponding to the normal reproducing speed, the
amount of the read digital audio data corresponding to
the digital audio data to be reproduced during the
predetermined time period; and search start timing
control means for controlling to start the search of the
center of a succeeding music number at the timing before
the completion of reproducing the preceding music number
so as to make the search of the succeeding music number
comp
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A digital audio disk player with a scan play
function for reproducing each music number during a

predetermined time period starting from a searched center
of the music number, comprising:


storage means (8) for storing processed digital audio
data;
read/write control means (10, 11) responsive to a scan play
instruction for writing the digital audio data of each

music number starting from a searched center into said
storage means at a speed higher than the

normal reproducing speed, and for
reading said digital audio data of said music number

starting from said searched center from said storage
means at a speed corresponding to the normal reproducing speed,

the amount of said read digital audio data corresponding
to the digital audio data to be reproduced during the

predetermined time period; and
search start timing control means (11-2) for controlling to
start the search of the center of a succeeding music

number at the timing before the completion of reproducing
the preceding music number so as to make the search of

said succeeding music number complete when the
reproduction of said preceding music number completes.
A digital audio disk player according to claim
1, wherein said read/write control means inhibits data

write when a predetermined amount of digital audio data
is written in said storage means during data read, and

starts data write when a predetermined amount of digital
audio data is read from said storage means.
