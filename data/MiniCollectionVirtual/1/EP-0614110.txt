<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a film-processing apparatus (100), in particular 
for X-ray sheet film, with a first feeding device (1) arranged in a daylight 

environment and serving for transporting film cassettes to a film 
loading and unloading station (4), a second feeding device (2) arranged 

in a darkroom environment and serving for transporting exposed film, and 
with a transport device (5) for moving the film sheets to a film-processing 

station (8), said apparatus being designed such that film can be fed to 
the film-processing station in a simple manner either in a daylight environment, 

in a darkroom environment or in both environments without the 
apparatus having to be modified in a complicated way. For this purpose, 

the apparatus comprises sealing means which connect the second feeding 
device (2) with the darkroom (10) in a light-tight manner and are releasably 

attachable by adhesive means, and the second feeding device (2) can 
be closed in light-tight manner by means of a lid (3b) pivotally mounted 

on a housing (12) of the film-processing apparatus (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a film-processing apparatus, in particular for
X-ray sheet film, with a first feeding device arranged in a daylight environment
and serving for transporting film cassettes to a film loading and
unloading station, a second feeding device arranged in a darkroom environment
and serving for transporting exposed film, and with a transport
device for moving the film sheets to a film-processing station.Apparatus for daylight handling of X-ray film loaded in cassettes are
known e.g. from prospectuses of the firm of Du Pont, said prospectuses
describing a cassette-handling system. A "Curix Compact Filmcenter" made
by Agfa-Gevaert and a "Multiloader 300" made by Kodak are also known. (*)
These apparatus allow film loaded in cassettes to be fed to a film-processing
unit via a loading and unloading station. Such a solution is also described by DE 37 05 851 A.The known apparatus are disadvantageous in that only such films can be
transported to the processing unit which have dimensions corresponding to
the cassette formats. Larger film sizes cannot be fed to such a processing
unit. On the one hand, this requires a separate processing unit and on
the other hand, loading of a cassette with the above dimensions is technically
complicated and cannot be realized in an economical manner.To avoid such disadvantages a modified "Capacity Plus-Filmcenter" of Agfa
is known which comprises a feeding device for transporting exposed films
in a darkroom environment. However, an apparatus of this type is disadvantageous
in that an installed feeding unit requires complicated and
extensive modifications in order that the film center be operated in daylight
and be thus independent of a darkroom. It is the object of the invention to design an apparatus of the generic
type such that by simple means film can be fed to the processing unit in
a daylight environment, in a darkroom environment or in both environments
without the apparatus having to be modified in a complicated
manner.In accordance with the present invention a film processing apparatus is provided as defined in claim 1. Essentially, the
problem is solved in that for connecting
the second feeding device with the darkroom in a light-tight manner, sealing
means are releasably attachable by adhesive means which allow the
processing unit to be removed from the darkroom quickly and easily.A lid pivotally mounted on the housing serves for sealing said feeding
device in a light-tight manner, and a film-guiding element hinged inside
the housing serves for

<CLAIMS>
Film-processing apparatus (100) for X-ray sheet film, comprising a
housing, a film loading and unloading station (4), a first

feeding device (1) located in the housing and being adapted for receiving a
film cassette loaded with an exposed film sheet and for transporting the film cassette to the film loading and unloading station, a second feeding

device (2) arranged to be connected to a darkroom environment outside the
housing of the apparatus for transporting film sheets not loaded in a cassette, and

a transport device (5) for moving the film sheets to a film-processing
station (8), characterized in that :


the film-processing station is located
inside the housing,
a seal (9) is releasably attachable by adhesive means to a wall (12) of the housing
of the apparatus for connecting the housing with the darkroom environment

(10) in a light-tight manner,
a lid (3b) is pivotally mounted on the housing wall (12) surrounded by said seal
for opening and closing inside said darkroom environment the second feeding device (2) in a light- tight manner so that

the film sheets can be processed by the film-processing station (8), and
a stationary path-guiding element (6) is arranged in the transport device (5) inside said housing for
joining film transport paths (4a, 3d) of the first and second feeding device.
Film-processing apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said lid (3b) can be
locked with the housing (12) by electromagnetic locking elements (3c) such

that transport rollers (1b) arranged in the first feeding device (1) are blocked
when the lid (3b) is in its released and open position and a driving motor (7)

of the transport device (5) can be switched on, and that the transport rollers
(1b) of the first feeding device (1) are released when the lid (3b) is in its

blocked and closed position and the driving motor (7) of the transport device
(5) can be switched on by an actuating member (1c) arranged in the feeding

path of the device (1). 
Film-processing apparatus according to claim 1 and 2, wherein said second
feeding device (2) includes a film-guiding element (3a) which is hinged to the

transport device (5) and serves for centrally guiding the film to a pair of
transport rollers (5a) of the transport device (5).
Film-processing apparatus according to claims 1 to 3, wherein a pair of film
transport rollers (5d) arranged in the film-processing station (8) is designed as

an actuating roller for switching off the driving motor (7).
