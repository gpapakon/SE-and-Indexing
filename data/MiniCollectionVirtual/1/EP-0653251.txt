<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for disintegrating, grading, separating and disposing of scrap appliances, essentially consisting of hollow products or parts thereof, in particular heating boilers, industrial water containers or the like. The object of providing a device for the purpose mentioned at the beginning, with which the treatment of scrap appliances can be carried out not only as efficiently as possible and broadly automatically, but also in an environmentally friendly manner, in conjunction with the provision that the operating medium for separating or disintegrating the metallic components can be used in circulation at least as far as possible, there are provided according to the invention a scrap-appliance base surface (1) with a water collector (2) arranged below its plane (E), and at least one water jet cutting device (3) which is arranged above the base surface (1) and can be controlled to be movable in several degrees of freedom, the base surface (1) being assigned a scrap-appliance feed device (4) and a separated-part removal device (6) leading to a grading device (5), and a waste-water treatment device (7) which is connected by lines to the water collector (2) and whose outlet (8) of clean water is connected to the water jet cutting device (3).

<CLAIMS>
A system for the decomposition and unadulterated separation of used devices to be 

discharged, in particular, boilers, process-water tanks or the like heating means, 
substantially consisting of hollow bodies or parts thereof, characterized by a bearing 

surface (1) for accommodating used devices with a water collecting tank (2) arranged 
underneath the plane (E) thereof, and at least one water-jet cutter (3) movably 

controllable in several degrees of freedom and arranged above the bearing surface (1), 
with a means for feeding the used devices (4) and a means for discharging the separated 

parts (6) leading to a sorting means (5) and a waste-water purifying means (7) 
connected through a conduit to the water collecting tank (2) being associated to the 

bearing surface (1), with the clear water discharge (8) of the said purifying means (7) 
being connected to the water-jet cutter (3). 
A system according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the bearing surface (1) for accommodating the used devices is 

designed as a bearing grid (1) upwardly closing the water collecting tank (2). 
A system according to claims 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that arranged in the area of the bearing surface (1) accommodating the 

used devices is at least one sensor (9) for positioning the used devices. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the drive(s) of 
the guiding mechanism (FM) of the at least one water-jet cutter (3) is (are) designed to 

be controllable by a program control. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
  
 

characterized in that the bearing face (1) at least from the plane thereof and the at least 
one water cutter (3) arranged above the bearing surface (1) are surrounded by an 

enclosure housing (12) provided with an inlet opening (10) for admitting the used 
devices and an outlet opening (11) for discharging the separated parts, with the said 

openings (10,11) on the housing (12) being provided with passage screens (13). 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the bearing grid 
(1') is in the form of an endless conveyor which, in turn, is part of the means (4,5) for 

supplying used device and/or discharging separated parts. 
A system according to claim 6, characterized in that the bearing grid (1') and the 
means (4) for supplying used devices and the means for discharging separated parts (5) 

are jointly designed as a rotating path (U). 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the waste-water 
purifying means (7) is formed of a water collecting and solids settling tank (14) provided 

with a solids discharge (15) and a feeder leading to an oil and grease separator (16) to 
which is connected a conduit (17) leading to at least one water-jet separator (13). 
A system according to claim 8,
 
characterized in that arranged behind the solids discharge (15) is a solids compressing 

means (18) provided with a water discharge (19).
