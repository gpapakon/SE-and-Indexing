<ABSTRACT>
A desulphurating agent is proposed for co-injection treatment of pig iron melts by injection of magnesium granulate and, separately, of the second injection component consisting of a magnesium granulate with a grain size of between 0.1 and 0.8 mm and containing 5-20 wt % calcium carbide with a grain size of 
<
/= 0.1 mm.

Desulfurizing agent for the coinjection treatment 
of pig iron melts by injecting magnesium granulate 

with a grain size between 0.1 and 0.8 mm and, 
separately, the second injection component,
wherein
 
the magnesium granulate contains 5 to 20 % by 

weight calcium carbide with a grain size of 
≤ 0.1 mm. 
Agent as claimed in claim 1,
wherein
 
the magnesium granulate contains 8 to 12 % by 

weight of the finely divided calcium carbide. 
Agent as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein
 
the particles of the granulate are in a coated 

form. 
Agent as claimed in claim 3,
wherein
 
the coating of the magnesium particles is composed 

of organic nitrogen compounds, in particular those 
of the NCN type. 
Process for desulfurizing pig iron by coinjection 
of magnesium granulate with a grain size of 0.1 to 

0.8 mm and a second component in which these two 
components are separately conveyed pneumatically 

and are only mixed immediately before introduction  
 

into the melt,
wherein
 
a magnesium granulate is used which contains 5 to 

20 % by weight calcium carbide with a grain size of 
≤ 0.1 mm. 
Process as claimed in claim 5,
wherein
 
a magnesium granulate is used which contains 8 to 

12 % by weight of the finely divided calcium 
carbide. 
Process as claimed in claim 5 or 6,
wherein
 
the magnesium granulate is used in a coated form. 
Process as claimed in claim 7,
wherein
 
a magnesium coated with organic nitrogen compounds 

especially those of the NCN type is used. 
Process as claimed in one of the claims 5 to 8,
wherein
 
the second coinjection component is composed of 

calcium carbide or lime.
