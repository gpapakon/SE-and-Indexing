<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device, fitted to an automotive or towed vehicle, for placing and optionally retrieving roadmarking cones 14, these cones being stored superposed by nesting in the form of a stack inside at least one magazine 8. The invention consists in that the device comprises a plate 4 arranged around a vertical axle 10 and located under the opening 28 of the said magazine 8, the said plate 4 comprising at least one opening 6 and a fork formed by two fingers 7 which penetrate between the bases 16 of the last cone 14 of the stack in the magazine 8, and the one immediately above, thus removing from the stack the last cone having to be placed on the roadway and retaining the cone immediately above. Application to placing roadmarking cones.

A device fitted to a self-propelled or towed vehicle (1) for placing and 
optionally retrieving road marker cones (14) formed by a hollow conical body (15) 

with a base (16), these cones being stored nested on top of each other in the form of a 
pile inside at least one magazine (8) in the form of a hollow vertical body open at least 

at its bottom (28) to allow the passage of a cone base (16), characterized in that it 
comprises a plate (4) arranged about a vertical axis (10) and disposed over the opening 

(28) of the said magazine (8), the said plate (4) having at least one opening (6) and a 
fork formed from two substantially horizontal tines (7) spaced apart in the radial 

direction to allow only the body (15) of a cone to pass, their free ends facing a radial 
edge of the said opening (6) a height (H) above the plate (4) at least equal to the 

thickness of the base (16) of a cone, in such a manner that, in the course of the 
displacement of the magazine (8) and/or of the plate (4) caused by relative rotation 

about the said vertical axis (10) in a sense such that the fork engages with its points the 
pile of cones contained in the magazine, the open base (28) of the magazine passes 

above the opening (6) formed in the plate (4), the tines (7) of the said fork penetrate 
between the bases (16) of the bottom cone (14) of the pile in the magazine and that 

immediately above, thus detaching from the pile, during the course of the 
displacement, the bottom cone before it is placed on the road and retaining the cone 

immediately above. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a plurality of 
magazines (8) in an arrangement radiating regularly around the axis of rotation (10) to 

form a carousel (9), and means for indexing the magazines step by step, each step 
corresponding to the angular spacing between two successive magazines. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the plate (4) is formed 
by at least one turn of a helical ramp of which the pitch is at least equal to the 

thickness of the base (16) of a cone (14).  
 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the bottom 
cone (14) detached from the pile of cones contained in the magazine (8) is 

accompanied as it leaves the opening (6) of the plate to be placed on the road, the 
means accompanying this bottom cone being formed by at least two vertical, parallel 

conveyor assemblies (17) located below the fork and spaced apart from one another by 
a distance sufficient to allow the passage of the base, the said conveyors (17) 

comprising dogs (18) which move in synchronism and on which the base rests in such 
a way that, when the said dogs (18) reach the vicinity of the road, they release the 

cone on to the road in a vertical position. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that each magazine 
(8) has a floating cap (11) or traveller near to its upper end, free to move along the 

inner walls of the said magazine between two limit positions defined by stops, so as to 
follow the cones both in the course of stacking them in the magazine and when needed 

of their removal, the cap (11) having at least one opening with a shape complementary 
to that of the body (15) of the cone so as to maintain axial movement of the cones 

inside the said magazine. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it comprises a 
cone retrieval device formed by overturning means (19) for the cone, for laying it 

down on the ground, vertical righting means (20) for the cone located downstream of 
the overturning means in the sense of advance of the vehicle and which penetrate, in 

the course of the advance of the vehicle, into the interior of the overturned cone for 
vertical righting by turning the said means, elevator means (17, 18) for the cone for 

bringing the base (16) of the cone above the top surface of the plate (4) substantially in 
contact with the lower plane of the tines (7) of the fork, between the tines (7) of which 

the body (15) of the cone passes freely to penetrate into the magazine (8) previously 
brought above the fork, in such a manner that each magazine (8) which has approached 

the fork at its root entrains on the plate the cone (14) thus fully introduced into the 
interior of the magazine as it continues its rotation.  

 
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that the righting means further 
comprises guide means for the cones which are spaced from the general alignment, 

these guide means being formed by arms (22) of convergent form between the cone 
overturning means (19) and the vertical righting means (20) for the cone, so as to 

delimit a guide path of substantially funnel form, the entrance to the guide path being 
adjacent to the overturning means (19) and corresponding to the largest opening of the 

funnel and being optionally fitted with a straightener (23) which enables, during the 
advance of the vehicle, rotation through 180Â° about their base (16) of cones (14) which 

present with the apex of their cone towards the interior of the guide path, in such a 
manner that the vertical righting means (20) by pivoting the cone, formed generally by 

a prong, can penetrate into the interior of the cone at the exit from the said guide path. 
A device according to claim 7, characterized in that the straightener (23) is 
formed by a generally horizontal shaft (25) movable parallel to itself and disposed 

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle on one side thereof, this shaft (25) 
carrying a dihedral (24) formed by two plates mounted to rotate freely at their common 

edge about the said shaft (25). 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the tines (7) of 
the fork are pivoted in the region of their root (26) for on the one hand maintaining the 

height (H) constant and on the other hand, in the case of a helical plate with a plurality 
of openings (6), to retract the upper surface of the tines flush with the upper surface of 

the plate when the opening (6) is not being used. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that it comprises 
an arm (27) pivoted on the vehicle or on the device, the said arm having an angle of 

attack which is variable as a function of the advance of the vehicle, so as to allow 
cones to be placed on the slant in such a manner as to form a slope on the road.
