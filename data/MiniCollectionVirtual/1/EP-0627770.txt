<ABSTRACT>
A tunable monolithic integrated photodetector (10) 
detects a selected wavelength of incident light within a 

wavelength range. The photodetector comprises a multiple 
quantum well (MQW) filter means (14) for receiving and filtering 

the incident light, and an MQW detector means (16) for receiving 
light from the MQW filter means and for detecting the selected 

wavelength. A fixed voltage bias V
Î”
 is disposed between 
the 

filter means and the detector means for causing the filter 
means to absorb light wavelengths around the selected 

wavelength to thereby enhance the detectability of the 
selected wavelength. Further, a variable voltage bias V
P
 is 
selectively and proportionally imposed on both the filter 

means and the detector means for permitting tuning of the 
photodetector. A fixed filter (27) may also be employed for 

filtering the incident light so that light wavelengths which 
are outside the range of the photodetector are eliminated. 

Finally, a plurality of the photodetectors may be arranged in 
a two dimensional array for image processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to monolithic
integrated circuit technology and electromagnetic
communication technology and, more particularly, to a tunable
monolithic integrated photodetector for detecting light at a
selected wavelength within a wavelength range.When light strikes a photosensitive material, light
energy, or photons, are absorbed by the material, and an
electrical current, often called a photocurrent because it
results from the absorption of photons, is generated in the
material. Photocurrent refers to the flow of electrons or
holes within the material. Moreover, a peak in the
photocurrent spectrum of the material which results from the
absorption of photons is oftentimes referred to as an exciton.In the prior art, it has been shown that a multiple
quantum well (MQW) diode can be used as a photodetector whose
voltage of maximum photocurrent, i.e., a large exciton, is
dependent upon the wavelength of incident light. In this
regard, see P.H. Wood et al., "Wavelength-Selective
Voltage-Tunable Photodetector Made from Multiple Quantum
Wells," Appl. Phys. Lett., vol. 47, no. 3, pp. 190-192, August
1, 1985. An MQW material is essentially a narrow bandgap
material which has a thickness substantially less than the
diameter of an exciton and which is sandwiched between wider
bandgap materials so as to enhance the exciton via confinement
of the energy potential well. The voltage of maximum
photocurrent within the MQW diode can be located and related
to the wavelength of the incident light, thereby allowing for
measurements of the wavelength. Identifying the wavelength of
incident light is beneficial in imaging and spectroscopy
applications. However, the light incident on a photosensitive material
can create multiple peaks in the photocurrent spectrum, that
is, more than one exciton. The photocurrent exhibits a
relatively large exciton, called a heavy hole (hh) exciton, at
the particular wavelength of incident light, as well as any
number of smaller excitons, called light hole (lh) excitons,
at other wavelengths of the photocurrent spectrum. Needless
to say, the occurrence of multiple excitons causes potential
ambiguity when one attempts to determine the wavelength of
incident light.More specifically, at room temperature (i.e.,
approximately 300 degrees Kelvin), the selectivity of an MQW
diode is step-like, producing photocurrent at all photon
wavelengths at and above the exciton wavelength. If no
electrical bias is applied to the MQW diode, the
peak-to-valley ratio of the hh exciton to
