<ABSTRACT>
Adjustable control cross-sections (15, 8) of a nozzlehead (1) are provided, separately or at a distance from the nozzle outlet (5) thereof, essentially completely encapsulated inside a housing (2), and the nozzle outlet (5) is divided into a ring of separate nozzle openings (6). As a result, in the case of favourable flow conditions, there is a very protected arrangement of the respective adjusting arrangement and in particular of the control edges or control surfaces.
