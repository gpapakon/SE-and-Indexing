<ABSTRACT>
Coating compositions including stable composite latex-pigment particles 
are prepared by dispersing titanium dioxide pigment particles in a dispersion of 

selected polymeric latex particles which have at least one dihydrogen phosphate 
functional group. The selected polymeric latex particles adsorb on to the titanium 

dioxide particles. Dibasic phosphate is then provided to the mixture to stop 
adsorption and stabilize the composite particles. The coating composition gives a 

coating with improved hiding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a process for preparing aqueous
compositions including polymeric latex and titanium dioxide pigment, and more
particularly to use of the aqueous compositions prepared as coating compositions.Aqueous dispersions of polymeric latex are used to prepare a tremendous
variety of commercially important products, including paints, coatings, primers,
mastics, caulks, binders for non-woven materials, and adhesives. Frequently, the
polymeric latex is included to form a continuous phase as the water is lost in
order to bind the product together, and to contribute important physical
properties.Titanium dioxide has been for many years the pigment of choice for
conferring opacity to plastic sheets and films, and particularly to coatings formed
from coating compositions and paints. In paints titanium dioxide is typically the
most expensive component of the formulation. It has been an ongoing objective
of the coatings industry to achieve the desired degree of opacity in a coating while
at the same time using as little titanium dioxide pigment as possible. One way in
which this is done is by employing titanium dioxide which has an optimal
average particle size and particle size distribution for scattering light. Another
way of making efficient use of the titanium dioxide employed is by dispersing
this pigment as well as possible.Agglomerated or aggregated titanium dioxide pigment particles make less
than their full potential contribution to the performance of the coatings, such as,
for example, with regard to coating opacity and colorant potential.The opacifying capability or hiding power of a paint or coating is a function
of the spacing of the titanium pigment particles in the dried coating. The light
scattering characteristics of titanium dioxide particles are well known. The
average size and size distribution of titanium dioxide particles used for opacifying
purposes has been highly optimized by the titanium dioxide manufacturers for
maximum scattering. Maximum light scattering occurs when the titanium
dioxide pigment particles have a diameter of from about 200 to about 250
nanometers and are spaced far apart from each other, on the order of a few
particle diameters, so that there is minimal interference between the light
scattering of neighboring particles.In practice, however, for example in the formulation of paints, it is widely
recognized that when enough titanium dioxide particles have been dispersed
into the polymeric coating vehicle to yield films of acceptable opacity, the
