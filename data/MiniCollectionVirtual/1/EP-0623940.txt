<ABSTRACT>
In a ceramic multilayer chip capacitor comprising 
alternately stacked internal electrodes of Ni or Ni alloy 

and dielectric layers, an oxide layer having a different 
composition from the dielectric layer is formed on the 

periphery of each internal electrode. The dielectric layer 
consists essentially of grains and a grain boundary phase, 

the percent area of the grain boundary phase being up to 2% 
of the area of a cross section of the dielectric layer. The 

capacitor is prepared by alternately stacking Ni or Ni alloy 
and a dielectric material in layer form, firing and then 

heat treating the stack under predetermined oxygen partial 
pressures. The dielectric material is a barium titanate 

base oxide material. The capacitor has a long effective 
life.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ceramic multilayer chip
capacitors and a method for preparing the same. More
particularly, it relates to an improvement in the dielectric
layer of ceramic multilayer chip capacitors.Multilayer ceramic chip capacitors are generally
manufactured by alternately applying an internal electrode-forming
paste and a dielectric paste in layers by
conventional green sheet, printing and other methods and
simultaneously firing the resulting layers as an integral
stack. Palladium (Pd) and palladium alloys have been widely
used as the internal electrodes although relatively
inexpensive nickel (Ni) and nickel alloys are now used as a
substitute for expensive palladium.Undesirably, internal electrodes of Ni or Ni alloy are
oxidized if fired in the ambient air. To prevent oxidation,
the stack after binder removal is fired under an oxygen
partial pressure lower than the equilibrium oxygen partial
pressure of Ni and NiO. The dielectric layer is oxidized
again by a further heat treatment. In this case, SiO2 is
added as a mineralizer for densification of the dielectric
material while Al2O3 is often added incidentally. The grain
boundary phase components including BaO and TiO2 as well as
these components are sources for a loss of insulation
resistance upon firing in a reducing atmosphere.Mn addition and Ca substitution are useful measures for
preventing a loss of insulation resistance due to reduction
of the dielectric layer. However, multilayer chip capacitors having internal
electrodes of Ni or Ni alloy have an extremely short life of
insulation resistance and are less reliable as compared with
multilayer chip capacitors having internal electrodes of Pd
fired in the atmospheric air.From EP-A-0187960 a low temperature sintered ceramic capacitor with high DC
breakdown voltage and a method of manufacture same is known wherein the solid
dielectric capacitor is built of a dielectric ceramic body comprising as a major
ingredient a compound {(Ba1-x-yCaxSry)O}k(Ti1-zZrz)O2, wherein the additive mixture must
fulfill specific requirements.Therefore, a primary object of the present invention is
to provide a reliable ceramic multilayer chip capacitor
having internal electrodes of Ni or Ni alloy in which the
effective life is extended by improving the dielectric layer
thereof.The present invention provides a ceramic multilayer
chip capacitor defined by the features of claim 1 and comprising internal electrodes of nickel or a
nickel alloy and dielectric layers stacked alternately with
the internal electrodes.
