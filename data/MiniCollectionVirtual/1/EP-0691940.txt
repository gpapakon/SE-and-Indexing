<ABSTRACT>
A control system is described for controlling the movement of a plunger for use in forming parisons in a glassware manufacturing machine in which the plunger is driven between first and second positions by a pneumatic piston and cylinder device in which pressure sensors sense the pressure on opposite sides of the piston. An electronic signal processing system incorporates a memory in which a motion profile and force limits are stored and which receives through each cycle a feedback signal relating to the transducer position of the plunger and from the pressure sensors the pressure on opposite sides of the piston and which produces control signals for a solenoid driven proportional pneumatic valve in accordance with a repetitive algorithm which takes account of (a) the displacement of the plunger from the motion profile, (b) the velocity of the plunger as derived from the rate of change of its position, and (c) the force exerted on the plunger as derived from the pressure difference across the piston. In this way the valve supplies air to the piston and cylinder device to cause the plunger to move from rest at a first position, for a first period of time in a manner limited by the motion profile. Thereafter a first force limit is applied to the plunger. Movement during a second period of time is controlled in a manner limited by the reduction from the first force limit to a second force limit and during a third period of time is limited by the second force limit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with plunger mechanisms for use in forming a gob of molten glass 
into a parison in a glassware forming machine. In a common type of glassware forming machine, the so-called I.S. machine, molten glass is 
formed into a parison and the parison is transferred to a mould in which it is blown into the 
shape of a container. Gobs of molten glass are formed into parisons either by a pressing 
operation alone (in the so called press and blow method) or by a pressing and blowing 
operation (in the so-called blow and blow method), both operations involving the use of a 
plunger mechanism. The operation of the plunger mechanism is crucial in the successful operation of the glassware 
forming machine. The time taken for the operation is often a significant factor in determining 
the cycle time of the machine, and to obtain consistent containers it is necessary that consistent 
operation of the plunger mechanism is provided. Small variations in the weight of a gob and 
in the size of the mould cavity make it difficult to determine when a pressing operation should 
terminate: it is essential that the pressure is sufficient to ensure that, when using the press and 
blow method, molten glass is forced down into a neck ring to form the eventual neck of the 
container, without being sufficient to force a two part blank mould apart and forming seams on 
the parison. In EP-A-165012, a plunger mechanism is described which is hydraulically operated, and 
comprises a piston and cylinder arrangement with the plunger being mounted for movement on 
the piston. A servo mechanism operates to control the rate at which hydraulic fluid enters 
and/or leaves the cylinder, and a position feed back device provides signals indicative of the 
position of the plunger to a control device which is arranged to control the movement of the 
piston during the first part of its stroke: towards the end of the stroke, when excessive pressure  
 
might cause opening of the parison mould, control is changed over from a position control to a 
pressure control - that is to say a limited pressure is exerted on the piston and its movement is 
determined to a large extent by a shrinkage of the glass in the mould which may take place. From the point of view of the movement achieved by the plunger, the arrangement in EP-A-165012 
is effective. However, in glass machines hydraulic mechanisms suffer from several 
disadvantages, and there is therefore a requirement for a pneumatically operated system. 
Hydraulic systems have an

A control system for controlling the movement of a plunger (12) for use in forming 
parisons in a glassware manufacturing machine which plunger is driven between first and 

second positions by a pneumatic piston and cylinder device (14,16) comprising: 

a solenoid driven proportional pneumatic valve (22) adapted to control the supply of air 
under pressure to the piston and cylinder device (14,16), 
a transducer (36) which senses the position of the plunger (12), 
pressure sensors (32,34) which sense the pressure on opposite sides of the piston of the 
piston and cylinder device (14,16), 
an electronic signal processing system (48) incorporating a memory (54,56) in which 
a motion profile and force limits are stored, which processing system through each cycle 

receives as a feedback from the transducer (36) the position of the plunger (12) and 
from the pressure sensors (32,34) the pressure on opposite sides of the piston (14) 

and which produces control signals for the valve (22) in accordance with a repetive 
algorithm which takes account of 


(a) the displacment of the plunger (12) from the motion profile, 
(b) the velocity of the plunger (12) as derived from the rate of change of its position, 
and; 
(c) the force exerted on the plunger (12) as derived from the pressure difference across 
the piston (14), 
 
so that the valve (22) supplies air to the piston and cylinder device (14,16) to cause the 

plunger (12) to move from rest at the first position for a first period of time in a manner 
limited by the motion profile and a first force limit applied to the plunger, for a second period of time in a manner limited 

by the reduction from the first force limit to a second 
force limit and for a third period of time limited by the second force limit. 
A system according to claim 1, wherein operation of the pneumatic valve (22) is 
controlled by a valve controller (26) connected to the valve (22) by two lines (28,30) one 

of which supplies a drive signal to the valve (22) to drive the valve spool and the other 
of which returns a spool-position indication signal.  

 
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the pressure sensors (32,34) sense 
the pressures in the cylinder (16) above and below the piston (14) and the position-sensing 

transducer (36) ceases movement of the piston (14). 
A system according to claim 3, wherein the three transducers (32,34,36) supply signals 
through analogue/digital converters (52) to a servo central card incorporating a 

microcontroller which instructs the valve controller (26) through a digital/analogue 
converter (50). 
A system according to claim 4, wherein the microcontroller (48) is connected to a 

memory (54,56) which stores a profile program for the movement of the plunger (12) and 
force limits for the plunger (12). 
A system according to claim 5, wherein a supervisory computer (58) for the machine 
is connected through an interface to the servo central card to pass algorithm information 

to the memory (54,56) which information is accessed by the valve controller (26) under 
the control of a synchronisation signal. 
A system according to claim 6, wherein means (66) are provided to enable the constant 
factors of the alogrithm information to be adjusted and adjustments stored in the memory 

(54,56). 
A system according to claim 7, wherein the microcontroller (48) repetitively accesses 
the memory (54,56) for the profile program, force limits, algorithm program and any 

factor adjustments and combines the accessed information to generate position demand 
signals fed to the valve controller (26). 
A system according to any of the claims 1 to 8, wherein the algorithm operates 
repetitively to generate the position signal signals subject to a valve demand limit, on the 

basis of a filtered force value subject to an error limit.
