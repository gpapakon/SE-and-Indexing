<ABSTRACT>
A novel protease which cleaves the C-terminus of the glutamic acid residue in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide 
originating in 
Streptomyces fradiae
, and a process for obtaining the protease from this bacterium. The invention has clarified the 
properties of this protease and also a DNA sequence coding for this protease and prepropeptides. The protease is specific for glutamic 

acid and is utilizable for various purposes, such as protein analysis and the cleavage of peptide chains at the desired site of 
a fused protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel protease for cleaving the carboxyl side
of a glutamic acid residue in an amino acid sequence of a polypeptide, and a
DNA sequence for encoding the protease.As an enzyme for acting on a protein (polypeptide) so as to specifically cleave
the carboxyl side of a glutamic acid (Glu) residue, V8 protease derived from
Staphylococcus aureus V8 strain is known (Gabriel R. Drapeau et al., J. Biol.
Chem. 247, 20, 6720-6726 (1972)). This enzyme is classified as a serine
protease. C. Carmona et al. (Nucl. Acids Res., 15, 6757 (1987)) cloned a DNA
sequence for encoding this enzyme.A similar enzyme, acidic amino acid specific endopeptidase derived from
Streptomyces griseus, which is an actinomyces, is also known (Norio Yoshida
et al., J. Biochem. 104, 3, 451-456 (1988)). Recently, I Svendsen et al. reported
an amino acid sequence of the acidic amino acid specific endopeptidase purified
from Streptomyces griseus (FEBS LETTERS 292 165-167 (1991)).
Furthermore, glutamic acid specific endopeptidase derived from Bacillus
subtilis is also known (Takuro Niidome et al., J. Biochem. 108, 965-970
(1990)). With respect to some of these proteases, the characteristics thereof
have been studied and inhibitors against them are known (K. Nagata et al., J.
Biochem. 110, 859-862 (1991) and T. Komiyama, J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17,
10727-10730 (1991)).The aforementioned enzymes are useful for specifically cleaving a protein at the
aforementioned site for the purpose of structural analysis of the protein; for
obtaining an objective protein through cleavage of a fusion protein in the case
where the objective protein is desired to be produced as the fusion protein by a
genetic recombination technique and the like. In the latter case, for example,
after producing the objective protein by coupling with another protein through a
Glu residue, the resultant is subjected to cleavage with one of the enzymes. Thus, the objective protein can be separated. Accordingly, there is a demand
for a protease having such an enzymatic activity other than the above-mentioned
enzymes.The objective of this invention is producing a novel polypeptide having protease
activity for cleaving the carboxyl side of a Glu reside, and a DNA sequence for
encoding the protease.The present inventors have made various studies to obtain a polypeptide having
the activity of an acidic amino acid specific endopeptidase (in particular, a
glutamic acid specific endopeptidase) from a strain of a microorganism other
than the above-mentioned
