<ABSTRACT>
A plaintext is enciphered using a plurality of 
stages in tandem via a plurality of iterations. Each of 

the stages is arranged to perform a complex key-dependent 
computation. The stage includes a memory for storing a 

key. A cipher function circuit transposes, using the 
key, one block applied to the stage from a preceding 

stage. An exclusive-or circuit implements an exclusive- 
or operation of the output of the cipher function and the 

other block applied to the stage from the preceding 
stage. A unique arrangement is provided for transposing 

the output of the cipher function circuit and then 
applying the output thereof to the memory. Therefore, 

the key is replaced with the output of the unique 
arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
arrangement for transforming plaintext into the
corresponding ciphertext in a digital data communications
system, and more specifically to an arrangement for
enciphering data blocks via iterated computations wherein
a key is renewed at each iteration. The arrangement
disclosed is also applicable to the reverse process of
transforming ciphertext into the original plaintext.In a data communications system, it is a common
practice to use cryptographic techniques in order to
prevent an unauthorized person(s) from obtaining data.
Plaintext to be transmitted is transformed into the
corresponding ciphertext. The plaintext can be
reproduced from the ciphertext by using exactly the
same key used to encipher it.A cipher is a secret method of writing whereby
plaintext (or cleartext) is transformed into the
corresponding ciphertext (sometimes called a cryptogram).
The process is called encipherment or encryption, while
the reverse process of transforming ciphertext into the
corresponding plaintext is called decipherment or
decryption. Both encipherment and decipherment are
controlled by a cryptographic key or keys.In 1977 the National Bureau of Standards of U.S.A.
announced a Data Encryption Standard (DES) to be used in
unclassified U.S. Government applications. DES enciphers
64-bit blocks of data with a 56-bit key.By way of example, known cryptographic techniques
utilizing DES are disclosed in 
JP-A-51-108701 and JP-A-51-108702 which were
respectively based on US-A-3 962 539
and US-A-3 958 081.Further, DES is disclosed in detail in a paper
entitled "Data Encryption Standard", Federal Information
Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 46-1,
Supersedes FIPS PUB 41, 1977 January 15, Reaffirmed 1988
January 22, published by U.S. Department of Commerce.DES enciphers 64-bit blocks of data with a 56-bit
key. The algorithm of DES, which is used both to
encipher and decipher, is such that an input block is
first transposed under an initial permutation IP. After
having passed through 16 iterations of a cipher function, it
is transposed under the inverse of the initial
permutation to give a ciphertext.The encipherment according to DES uses a common key
which is prepared before encipherment and is fixed
through encipherment. Accordingly, this algorithm has
encountered the problem that the cipher is somewhat
computationally vulnerable.It is an object of the present invention to provide
a hardware arrangement for enciphering blocks of data,
via a plurality of iterations, using
