<ABSTRACT>
In a process for on-line quality control in laser machining by means of electro-optical determination of the near-infrared radiation of the swarf ejected through the ''steam passage'' during laser machining of the material, the size of the cavities (pores, holes) produced in the workpiece is measured. The radiation of the swarf is measured in a wavelength range of 800 nm to approximately 1300 nm, preferably with simultaneous determination of the near-UV radiation of the plasma cloud in a preferred wavelength range of approximately 200 nm to approximately 450 nm. A process for evaluating the near-UV signals is also described.
