<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a multi-layer fuel and vapor tube with the features of the preamble of
claim 1.An alcohol resistant multi-layer tube for motor vehicles is known from DE 3827092 having an
inner layer of polyamide, an intermediate layer of polyvinyl-alcohol, a thick outer layer of
polyamide and a covering layer of polyester. The tubing is coextruded and resists mechanical
stress especially under high-temperature conditions. The tube does not provide a hydrocarbon
barrier.US 5 170 011 discloses a hose assembly for fuels having a tubular inner liner of polymeric
fluorocarbon material and an outer liner comprising an expanded polyamide material disposed
about the inner liner. Further, the assembly includes a conductive strip formed along the inner
liner for dissipating electrical charges. The polyamide material of the outer liner increases the
strength of the hose assembly but does not provide a hydrocarbon barrier.It is the object of the present invention to provide a tubing consisting of a material which can
be employed in motor vehicles, which is durable and prevents or reduces permeation of
organic materials therethrough. Additionally, the tubing should be essentially nonreactive with
components of the liquid being conveyed therein.These problems are solved by the features of the characterizing portion of claim 1. According
to the invention, the thermoplastic material employed in the intermediate bonding layer
includes as a major constituent an extrudable, melt-processible thermoplastic polyester
selected from the group consisting of polybutylene terephalate, polyethylene terephalate,
polytetramethylene terephalate and mixtures thereof, the thermoplastic polyester functioning in
combination with the inner and outer layers as a hydrocarbon barrier layer.Embodiments and preferred aspects of the present invention can be taken from the subclaims
making reference to the accompanying description and the drawing. The objects, features and advantages of the
present invention will become more readily apparent from
the following description, reference being made to the
following drawing in which:
Fig. 1 is a sectional view through a piece of
tubing of the first and second embodiments of the
present invention; andFig. 2 is a sectional view through a piece of
tubing of the third embodiment of the present invention.The present invention is a multi-layer fuel
line and vapor tube which contains at least one bonding
layer and at least an outer and an inner tubing layer.
