<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a smoke outlet window and its
opening and closing mechanism. The smoke outlet window

is arranged to open with respect to its vertical axis, so that
each window element (10a, 10b) is attached, at the top and

bottom sash, to the window frame by means of axle stubs
(11a, 11b). Advantageously the axle stubs (11a, 11b) are

arranged in an intermeshed fashion, so that the window unit
can be opened completely. The opening and closing

mechanism is based on a process where the power
generated by a manually operated actuator, such as a hand

crank (18), is transmitted to the lever arms (12, 14, 15) for
example by means of a wire rope (31) and a slide (17), said

lever arms (12, 14, 15) being arranged to move so that the
window can be opened and closed. The movements of the

window elements (10a, 10b) can be synchronized for
instance by interconnecting said window elements (10a,

10b) by means of a rod (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a smoke outlet window and a mechanism for opening and
closing the same. In particular, the invention relates to a window that opens with
respect to the vertical axis, and an opening mechanism meant for opening and
closing said window, which mechanism can be controlled by means of an actuator.The Finnish Ministry of Environment has issued regulations, according to which for
instance apartment houses and industrial properties must be provided with a system
for exhausting smoke accumulated in said facilities. The simplest way to remove
smoke is traditional airing through a hatch, advantageously a window. The size of
the smoke outlet window is proportional to the volume of the space to be aired. The
smoke outlet window can for example be a window hatch located somewhere in the
top area of an apartment house stairwell, or possibly a skylight or a trap door.Because the smoke outlet window is located, for instance in the case of apartment
houses, in the top area of the stairwell, it is fairly difficult for the user to find access
to the window so as to open it. This is the case with other high-positioned windows,
too. One solution for avoiding said problem is introduced in the GB patent
1,046,918. Said publication specifies a vertically fitted window and a system for
opening the same, which is controlled by means of a manual hand crank. The
opening system is a fairly complicated mechanism based on bevel gears and
composed of several elements, whereby the window is opened and closed.The object of the present invention is to realize a window suited for exhausting
smoke, which window can be opened and closed by remote control, by
intermediation of a simple actuator. Another object of the present invention is to
realize a mechanism for opening and closing the window.Said objects are achieved by means of a window structure, where the window is
attached to the frame by means of vertical axle stubs, around which stubs the
opening and closing procedure takes place. The objects of the opening and closing
mechanism are achieved by means of a system attached to the window frame and
sash and based on lever arms, which system can be can be operated by means of
remote control, for instance by means of a hand crank. The smoke outlet window according to the invention is characterized by what is
stated in the independent claim 1. Other preferred embodiments of the invention are
enlisted in the dependent claims.The operation of the invention is based on the fact that the lever arms attached to
the

<CLAIMS>
A smoke outlet window composed of two or more window elements (10a;
10b), being arranged to be opened and closed by means of an opening and closing

mechanism realized by lever arms (12, 14, 15), characterized in that
the axle stubs (11a; 11b) for attaching the window elements (10a; 10b) to the
window frame are attached to the top and bottom sashes of each window element

(10a; 10b), in an intermeshed fashion with respect to the axle stubs (11a, 11b) of the
rest of the window elements (10a; 10b), so that the window is made turnable around

said axle stubs (11a, 11b);
the opening and closing mechanism includes a slide (17) and a slide guide bar (16)
for transmitting power to the lever arms (12, 14, 15) and for focusing said power in

order to turn the window around the axle stubs (11a, 11b).
A smoke outlet window according to claim 1, characterized in that each
window element (10a, 10b) is arranged to be fastened by a rod (19) to the window

elements (10a, 10b) adjacent to said window element (10a, 10b) in order to
synchronize the opening and closing of the window unit formed by said window

elements.
A smoke outlet window according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that to the
slide (17) and the second lever arm (14), there is attached a third lever arm (15),

which turns said second lever arm (14) attached to the window frame, so that the
generated power effect is transmitted to the window frame and to the first lever arm

(12) fastened to the window sash and to said second lever arm (14), in order to open
or close the window.
A smoke outlet window according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the window opening and closing power is arranged to be

transmitted to the slide (17) by means of a hand crank (18).
A smoke outlet window according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the window opening and closing power is arranged to be

transmitted to the slide (17) by means of a wire rope (31).
