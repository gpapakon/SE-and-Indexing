<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image forming
method by which characters, figured patterns, pictures
or the like are recorded on recording mediums having a
plate, sheet or foil made of aluminum or aluminum
alloy (hereinafter often simply "aluminum sheet"), as
exemplified by nameplates, display boards,
construction wall materials, automobile panels and
parts, tableware, aluminum cans and interior
decorative panels. It also relates to a process for
producing a decorative aluminum plate, and an apparatus
used for carrying out such a process.As recording mediums for ink-jet recording,
paper is in general use. Those made of other than
paper are limited to plastic films provided on at 
least one side thereof a layer endowed with ink
absorption properties by a special treatment. This is
considered due to the fact that ink-jet recording
apparatus have been mainly used for office work and
hence records are mostly made on paper serving as an
information medium and also that recording mediums are
required to have ink absorption properties and fixing
properties on account of the ink-jet recording system
in which ink droplets are caused to fly and adhere to
recording mediums.Under such circumstances, as ink-jet recording
apparatus are made to have a higher speed and a higher
function, the application of ink-jet recording to
recording mediums made of materials other than paper
or plastic film is attracting notice. In particular,
ink-jet recording on metallic materials such as
aluminum or alloys thereof is expected not only to
make it possible to provide a simpler recording
process applicable on metallic materials, which can
substitute printing or the like, but also to promote
the expansion of use of articles made of metallic
materials and on which characters, patterns, pictures
or the like have been recorded.Metallic materials utilized in a variety of
fields and uses may include aluminum and alloys
thereof. In particular, aluminum materials on the 
surfaces of which anodic oxide layers, what is called
aluminum anodic oxide layers, are formed to improve
the corrosion resistance, surface strength and
decorativeness of aluminum have been hitherto used in
construction materials, tableware, panels for
electronic machinery, etc., and also in radiator
panels or the like utilizing good heat dissipation
properties of such layers. In particular, because the
aluminum anodic oxide layers can be colored with ease,
members having aluminum anodic oxide layers are also
used as decorated wallboard materials or door members,
as well as
