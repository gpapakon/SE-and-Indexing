<ABSTRACT>
A simple and compact pulse combustor realizes stable pulse 
combustion with reduced noise and vibration. The pulse 

combustor has a cylindrical combustion chamber (1) with a 
predetermined volume (V1) for receiving, separately, a rich 

mixture of primary air and gaseous fuel and secondary air, a 
tail pipe (10) connecting to the combustion chamber (1) for 

exhausting hot combustion byproducts from the combustion 
chamber (1), and a nozzle plate (4) with a plurality of gas 

nozzles (2) for supplying the rich air/fuel mixture to the 
combustion chamber (1) and a plurality of air nozzles (3) for 

supplying the secondary air to the combustion chamber (1). 
The pulse combustor further has a baffle plate (15) 

confronting the nozzle plate (4) with a predetermined gap (S) 
therebetween, for absorbing heat and reverse pressure 

generated by the hot combustion byproducts flowing back from 
the combustion chamber (1). An air chamber (11) of the 

combustor has a predetermined volume (V2) which is greater 
than the volume (V1), for supplying the secondary air to the 

combustion chamber (1) through the plurality of air nozzles 
(3) and for receiving hot combustion byproducts which flow 

back from the combustion chamber (1). A fan (12) 
continuously feeds the secondary air to the air chamber (11). 

A small portion of hot combustion byproducts flowing back  
 

from the combustion chamber (1) to the air chamber (11) is 
sufficiently mixed with the secondary air continuously 

supplied to the air chamber (11) by means of the fan (12) and 
is fed back to the combustion chamber (1) via the plurality 

of air nozzles (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pulse combustor, which 
separately supplies a rich mixture of primary air and gaseous 
fuel and secondary air to a combustion chamber thereof for 
continuous combustion. A typical example of a conventional pulse combustor for 
pulsative ignition and continuous combustion of an air/fuel 
mixture is disclosed in US Patent No. 4,891,003 (Japanese 
Patent Laying-Open Gazette No. Sho-64-23005). The prior art 
combustor, as shown in accompanying Fig. 5, has a cylindrical 
combustion chamber 1, a nozzle plate 4 with a plurality of 
gas nozzles 2 and a plurality of air nozzles 3 arranged in 
the combustion chamber 1, and a circular resistant plate 5 
disposed opposite to the nozzle plate 4 via a predetermined 
narrow space S. A jet of rich air/fuel mixture running 
through a gas conduit 6 is supplied from each of the gas 
nozzles 2 to the combustion chamber 1 while a jet of 
secondary air fed to an air chamber 8 by means of a fan 7 is 
supplied from each of the air nozzles 3 to the combustion 
chamber 1. The rich air/fuel mixture and the secondary air 
are sufficiently mixed between the resistant plate 5 and the 
nozzle plate 4, and ignited by a spark of an ignition plug 9 
in the combustion chamber 1 for pulse combustion. A large 
portion of hot combustion byproducts is exhausted through a 
tail pipe 10. Although the high explosion pressure in the  
 
combustion chamber 1 tends to cause a back flow of the 
combustion byproducts to the supply source, the resistant 
plate 5 in the combustion chamber 1 prevents such undesirable 
back flow. Exhaustion of the combustion byproducts makes the 
pressure in the combustion chamber 1 negative, so that 
another jet of the rich air/fuel mixture and that of the 
secondary air are successively fed into the combustion 
chamber 1 and spontaneously ignited and combusted by the 
residual hot exhausted gas in the combustion chamber 1. 
Ignition and combustion are periodically repeated in the 
above manner to heat an object like cooking oil in an oil 
tank. In the system of the prior art pulse combustor, however, 
combustion byproducts once flown back to the supply source 
are not effectively mixed with the rich air/fuel mixture and 
the secondary air nor returned to the combustion chamber 1. 
Relatively high supply pressures of the rich air/fuel mixture 
and the secondary air as well as the resistant plate 5 are 
required for efficiently preventing the back flow of 
combustion byproducts. More concretely, the pulse combustor 
of the prior art
