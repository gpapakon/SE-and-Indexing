<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radio transceiver for at least a first and a second frequency band with intermediate-frequency conversion by means of a mixing frequency. For multiband radio transceivers which are intended to be especially suitable for radio bands which are relatively far apart, the invention proposes that a common local oscillator is provided for transmitting and receiving section and that the intermediate frequency is the same for transmitting and receiving section.

<CLAIMS>
A radio transceiver for the GSM, DCS 1800 or DECT radio systems,
characterized in that only one common mixing oscillator (31) is provided whose

frequency lies approximately midway between the first GSM band and the second DCS
1800 and DECT band, in that by means of a respective separate integrated highly

symmetrical Gilbert cell mixer (30) for the sending and receiving portion for
minimiziation of the in-band spurious responses a conversion is made from/to IF

processing arrangements (40, 42) whose frequency is the same for sending and
receiving branch and is situated at 380 - 470 MHz, preferably at 400 MHz, while the IF

processing arrangements (40, 42) include intermediate frequency filters which are
arranged as a surface acoustic wave filter.
A radio transceiver as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the radio
transceiver can be switched between the GSM and/or DCS 1800 and/or DECT radio

systems.
A radio transceiver as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that a changeover
switch (32) is inserted between high-frequency input stages (12, 22), transmitter

output stages (13, 23) and the integrated mixers (30) which are separate for sending and
receiving branch.
A radio transceiver as claimed in one of the previous claims,
characterized in that when the same set of modules (30, 31, 40, 41, 42, 43) is used for

a multiband transceiver, the transceiver concept is applicable to at least two different
radio systems, or also only for a single band (e.g. GSM at 900 MHz. or DCS 1800 at

1.8 GHz).
