<ABSTRACT>
A bicycle hub dynamo for mounting in the hub of a bicycle wheel has two flanges for securing rim-holding spokes and is rotatively mounted on an axis of the wheel. The hub dynamo has a current generating rotor/stator induction system driven by a gear (21). The gear (21) rotates the rotor at a speed which corresponds to that of conventional bicycle dynamos. When the dynamo is disengaged, the gear (21) is completely separated from the hub body (1) and is completely at rest with respect to the axis (3). A hollow cylinder (6) with an internal toothing which surrounds the gear (21) covers all gear stages. The gear (21) is designed as a kind of planetary gear.

<CLAIMS>
Hub dynamo for installation in a hub of a bicycle
wheel, wherein said dynamo is rotatably installed on

an axle (3) of the bicycle wheel and contains two hub
flanges for mounting spokes in order to stabilize the

rim, wherein a rotor/stator induction system for
generating a current is driven by means of a gear (21)

and the generated current is delivered via a current
collector contact, wherein the rotor carries a pinion

that is functionally connected to the gear (21) that,
in turn, can be functionally connected to a clutch

disk that rotates synchronously with the hub body (1)
by means of a clutch (33) under the influence of a

spring pressure, wherein the clutch (33) is actuated
by pins (41) that can be axially displaced by means of

a cam plate, wherein the gear (21) is completely
disengaged from the hub body (1) in the deactivated

state and at a complete standstill referred to the
axle (3), wherein the pinion (26) of the first spur

wheel stage of the gear (21) is separably or rigidly
connected to the axle (3), wherein the hollow cylinder

(6) that surrounds the gear (21) contains an internal
toothing and overlaps all gear stages, and wherein the

gear stages that follow the first gear stage are
realized in the form of planetary gears, 
characterized
by
 the fact that the clutch (33) is realized in the
form of a friction clutch, wherein both sides of the

clutch disk (10) can be brought in contact with clutch
linings (34) that are secured from rotating under the

influence of a compression spring (37), wherein said
clutch disk is guided in longitudinal grooves of a

bushing-shaped adjusting ring (36) by means of tabs
arranged 
on the internally geared wheel, wherein said
adjusting ring is arranged on the axle (3) and can be

displaced coaxially to the axle (3) by means of the
pin (41), and wherein a toothing (39) that can be 

functionally engaged with a toothing (38) of the
pinion (26) in a separable fashion is arranged on the

adjusting ring (36).
Hub dynamo according to Claim 1, 
characterized by
 the
fact that the coil arrangement (16) is arranged on a

generally bushing-shaped clamping element (40) that is
pushed onto the axle (3) and screwed into the bearing

members (32b).
Hub dynamo according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized
by
 the fact that the magnetic rotor (15) respectively
adjoins one axial bearing (20) on both sides, wherein

the pressure of a spring (17) acts upon one of the
axial bearings (20).
Hub dynamo according to Claim 3, 
characterized by
 the
fact that the spring (17) adjoins the outer race of

the bearing (2) that is arranged on the bearing member
(32b).
