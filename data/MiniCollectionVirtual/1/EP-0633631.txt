<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) is provided for 
surface mounting along an edge (14) of a circuit board (16) 

in an edge straddling configuration. The circuit board has 
a plurality of contact pads (18, 38) spaced along opposite 

faces (16a, 16b) of the board near the edge thereof. The 
connector includes a dielectric housing (20) and a 

plurality of terminals mounted on the housing with solder 
tails (32, 34) projecting from the housing generally in two 

rows to define an elongate board-receiving mouth (36) for 
receiving the edge of the circuit board. The contact pads 

are adapted to receive soft solder paste (19, 39) thereon 
prior to insertion of the board into the mouth between the 

two rows of solder tails. The solder tails of the 
terminals are configured for receiving the circuit board at 

a first angular orientation wherein minimal contact force 
is effected between the solder tails and the contact pads 

to prevent any substantial wiping away of the solder paste 
from the contact pads and a second angular orientation 

wherein substantial contact force is effected between the 
solder tails and the contact pads in a direction generally 

normal to the faces of the circuit board. Therefore, the 
solder paste remains in an interface area at each contact 

pad and its respective solder tail.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a system for
surface mounting an electrical connector assembly along an
edge of a circuit board in an edge straddling
configuration.There are a wide variety of electrical connectors
adapted for surface mounting on a printed circuit board.
Some such connectors are mounted to one side of the circuit
board and include solder tails for surface mounting to
contact pads on the side of the board or for insertion into
holes in the circuit board for soldering to circuit traces
interconnected to the holes. Other such connectors are
adapted for mounting along an edge of the circuit board,
with solder tails of the terminals engageable with contact
pads on one or both sides of the board adjacent the edge.
The latter type of connectors commonly are called "edge
connectors" and, when the solder tails engage contacts on
both sides of the board along the edge, the connectors
commonly are called "straddle mount" connectors.One of the problems encountered with straddle
mount connectors is that soft solder paste or cream is
removed from vital portions of the board contact pads if
there is a sliding engagement between the tails and the
pads during positioning of the board and the connector in
such a straddle mount condition. In a straddle mount
connector system, the board must be inserted in a slot or
mouth defined between solder tails engageable with contact 
pads on both opposite sides of the board in a straddling
configuration. Soft solder paste is applied to the contact
pads on both sides of the board before the board is
inserted into the connector. It is desirable to have a
predetermined contact force between the solder tails and
the board contact pads, in a direction normal to the board,
to provide good electrical contact points. On the other
hand, it is desirable to have zero or minimal forces
between the solder tails and the contact pads while
positioning the solder tails on the contact pads to prevent
the soft solder paste from being wiped off of the contact
pads which can result in defective solder interfaces or
short circuiting between adjacent contact pads.Various approaches have been made in the
connector industry to solve the problems outlined above.
For instance, in U.S. Patent No. 5,160,275, dated November
3, 1992, a straddle mount electrical connector is provided
which will not cause removal of a cream solder that has
been applied to the circuit board, and which will not flaw
the surface of circuit portions on the
