<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for the
provision of an exercise regimen for users and, in
particular, to a system which facilitates semi-automated
monitoring of a user's progress in the exercise regimen.
The present invention also relates to a novel device for
monitoring heartbeat.The present invention further relates to a novel data
processing device for facilitating the provision and
monitoring of an exercise regimen for a user.One of the most important factors in maintaining good
health is physical exercise. A number of major studies in
recent years have demonstrated the health benefits of
regular physical exercise, particularly in respect to
maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.The beneficial effects of physical exercise can be
negated, however, if the physical exercise regimen is not
carefully designed, or if a carefully designed regimen is
not correctly followed. "Over-training" is an all too
common syndrome in athletes and others engaging in
physical training programmes, which can produce severe
physical effects such as skeletal and heart muscle
wasting, tiredness and degradation of the body's immune
system. When "unfit" people commence a programme of
physical exercise, the dangers of an ill designed
programme or the person incorrectly carrying out the
programme can be even greater. When the body is not used
to exercise, sudden physical stress can lead to stroke and
fatality.In order to gain the benefits of regular physical
exercise, therefore, it has become common for people to
attend gymnasiums where they can obtain some degree of
"coaching" from trainers employed by the gymnasium. A
problem with this is that, in order to obtain the benefits
of monitoring of exercise by the gymnasium staff, it is
necessary for the user to attend the gymnasium at frequent This can be inconvenient, particularly where the gymnasium is not
located near the user. Further, one gym instructor will usually have to
attend to the needs of many gym users. Each user does not really have the
benefit of personal coaching. It is, therefore, still possible for a user to
incorrectly exercise, possibly leading to some of the ill-effects discussed
above.An alternative to training in a public or private gymnasium is to hire
one's own personal trainer. Obviously, the expense of this is prohibitive for
most people.A system is described in patent specification WO 87/05727 in which
a portable exercise monitor is provided which may be carried by a user while
exercising, and the measured parameters later transferred to
