<ABSTRACT>
In the semiconductor integrated circuit device of 
the present invention which uses MOSFETs as its components, 

the gate electrode of the MOSFET is constructed by using 
a silicide gate, a polycide gate or a metal gate. The 

source-drain region of the MOSFET for the internal circuit 
which does not require connection to an external circuit 

has the salicide structure, and the source-drain region 
of the MOSFET for the buffer circuit which requires a 

direct connection to an external device has a region 
which is not of salicide structure at least in a portion 

adjacent to the gate electrode. The gate electrode and 
the source-drain region of the internal circuit become 

to have low resistances so that it is possible to realize 
an increase in the operating speed by using them as a 

part of the wirings. Further, in the source-drain 
region of the buffer circuit there is provided a region 

of high resistance in the vicinity of the gate electrode 
so that it is possible to enhance the ESD resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
integrated circuit device containing MOSFETs and a method 
of fabricating the same. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit 
device including MOSFETs having metal silicide films on 
the surface of source and drain regions and a method of 
fabricating the same. In semiconductor integrated circuit devices, reduction 
in the element dimension has been progressing rapidly due 
to increase in the device density and increase in the 
operating speed. Further, in semiconductor integrated 
circuit devices including MOSFETs, suppression of the 
short channel effect of the MOSFETs is also required. 
For this purpose, source and drain regions are made 
shallow. However, making the junction of the source-drain 
diffused layer shallow brings about an increase 
in the sheet resistance thereof. Since the source and 
drain diffused layers and the gate electrodes are used 
as a part of the wirings, the increase in the sheet 
resistance of the diffused layers and the reduction in  
 
the size of the gate electrodes causes increase in the 
wiring resistance to lower the operating speed of the 
circuit. The increase in the sheet resistance of the gate 
electrode due to the reduction in the size thereof can 
be prevented by using suitable material for the gate 
electrodes. In recent years, in place of a gate electrode 
only made of a polycrystalline silicon film (the so-called 
silicon gate electrode), a gate electrode having a 
structure of laminating a metal silicide film on a 
polycrystalline silicon film (the so-called polycide 
structure) or a gate electrode only made of a metal 
silicide film has been used. Further, a gate electrode 
made of a refractory metal has been employed. On the other hand, concerning the sheet resistance, 
a structure for reducing the sheet resistance of regions 
was disclosed in IEDM Tech. Dig., 1982, pp. 714-717 by 
C.K. Lau et al. According to this structure, a metal 
film is deposited on the surface of a diffused layer 
(or region) formed in the surface portion of a silicon 
substrate, silicification reaction is induced by heat 
treatment between silicon of the diffused layer and 
the metal film, the metal film left unreacted being 
thereafter removed. Thus, a metal silicide film is 
formed in self-aligned fashion with respect to the 
diffused layer. The structure of MOSFET obtained thus  
 
is called "salicide" (abbreviation for self-aligned 
silicide). The sheet resistance of the diffused
