<CLAIMS>
A mixture of oligomeric phosphoric acid esters
which carry hydroxyalkoxy groups, of the formula I



in which 
q
 denotes an average chain length of 0.5
to 10, R
1
 is a hydroxyl-containing radical of the
formula IIa, R
2
 is a radical of the formula III


R
3
 is a radical of the formula IIb, R
4
 is R
1
 or R
3
;
R
5
, R
6
 and R
7
 are an H atom or an alkyl radical
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, m is 0 to 4 and n is 1

to 4.
A process for the preparation of the mixture as
claimed in claim 1, 
which comprises
 reacting one or
more ortho-phosphoric acid esters of the formula IV 



with phosphorus pentoxide in a molar ratio of (2.1
to 3.5) : 1.0 in a first stage at a temperature of

20 to 180°C in the course of 0.5 to 72 hours in a
manner which is known per se, partly hydrolyzing or

glycolyzing the P-O-P bonds selectively in the
resulting polyphosphoric acid ester mixture of the

formula V,


in which 
p
 denotes an average chain length of 4
to 60, in a second stage by addition of water or a

glycol of the formula VI


in which R
5
, R
6
 and n have the abovementioned
meaning, at a temperature of 20 to 100°C, and

reacting the resulting mixture of polyphosphoric
acid partial esters of the formula VII


 
in which R
2
 has the abovementioned meaning or is
zero, 
q
 denotes a reduced average chain length of
only 0.5 to 10 and R
8
 has the meaning of R
3
 or is an
H atom, with an epoxide of the formula VIII in a

third stage at a temperature of 20 to 180°C.

The use of the mixture as claimed in claim 1 as a
reactive flameproofing agent in polyurethane foams.
