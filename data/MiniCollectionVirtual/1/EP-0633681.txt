<ABSTRACT>
A digital radio communication system (90, 110) achieves low 
envelope variations in a transmitted signal by encoding digital 

information as phase angle differences in a transmitted radio 
signal and by constraining the maximum possible phase angle 

difference. This reduction in envelope variation relaxes the 
linearity requirements for a desired level of distortion 

suppression of a radio frequency (RF) amplifier means (101) 
employed for transmitting the radio signal. In addition, lower 

envelope variations imply a higher average transmit power for a 
given maximum transmitted power, thereby extending range and 

battery life.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. Patent applications "A 
Trellis Coded Modulation Scheme with Low Envelope Variation 
for Mobile Radio" by Rajaram Ramesh (Docket No. RD-22,411) 
filed concurrently with this application; "Trellis Coding 
Technique to Improve ACIPR in Land Mobile Radio Systems 
Under Peak Power Constraints" by Sandeep Chennakeshu, 
Amer A Hassan and John B. Anderson Serial No. 07/898,670, 
filed 6/15/92; and "Improved Trellis Coding Technique to 
Increase Adjacent Channel Interference Protection Ratio in 
Land Mobile Radio Systems Under Peak Power Constraints" by 
Sandeep Chennakeshu, Rajaram Ramesh, Amer A. Hassan, 
John B. Anderson, Ser. No. 07/975,201, filed 6/12/92; all assigned 
to the present assignee and hereby incorporated by reference. This invention relates to land mobile radio systems and 
more specifically to a method and apparatus for minimizing 
adjacent channel interference by constraining transmitted power 
envelope variations for mobile radio systems. Conventional land mobile radio (LMR) channels employ 
narrow-band frequency division multiplexed (FDMA) systems for 
base stations to communicate with mobile radio units. Each base 
unit/mobile unit communicating pair employs a different 
frequency band.  Speech communication may be executed by digitizing the 
speech, and transmitting the encoded speech information. Other 
digital information may be desired to be communicated between a 
base and mobile radio unit. Currently, there is an immediate need for an increase in 
capacity of LMR systems in the U.S. for such applications as public 
safety trunking. The trend is to increase capacity by splitting each 
existing 25 KHz channel used in LMR systems into two 12.5 KHz 
channels. However, this causes adjacent channel interference 
(ACI). ACI is interference introduced at a receiver from a 
transmitter broadcasting at a frequency corresponding to an 
adjacent channel and this is sometimes called adjacent channel 
'splatter'. This interference is increased by intermodulation and 
harmonic distortions caused by non-linearities in a radio 
frequency (RF) amplifier in the transmitter. The need for capacity in land mobile radio (LMR) systems 
can be met by improving spectral efficiency (to values greater than 
1 bit/sec/Hz). However, the achievable spectral efficiency is limited 
by stringent adjacent-channel interference protection 
specifications. Continuous phase modulation (CPM) schemes such as 4-level 
digital FM can meet the adjacent channel interference 
protection ratio
