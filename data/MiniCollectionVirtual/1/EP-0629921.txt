<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatographic printing process is described for 
forming one or more colourless toner images in 

combination with at least one colour toner image produced 
in an electrostatographic way on a receptor element (12). 

The information for producing at least one electrostatic 
latent image corresponding with said colourless toner 

image(s) derives from a digital electrical signal 
representing (i) the spatial boundaries of said 

colourless toner image and (ii) the amount of deposited 
colourless toner per pixel. Said process comprises the 

step of conveying said receptor element (12) past one or 
more toner image-producing electrostatographic stations 

(A, B, C, D). At each image-producing station the 
following operations are carried out: 


forming each electrostatic latent image on a rotatable 
endless surface means (26); 
depositing toner on said electrostatic latent image to 
form a toner image on said rotatable surface means (26), 

and 
transferring each toner image from its corresponding 
rotatable surface means (26) onto said receptor element 

(12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrostatographic 
printing process for forming one or more colourless toner 
images in combination with at least one colour toner 
image and to an electrostatographic printer for carrying 
out said process. Electrostatographic printing operates according to the 
principles and embodiments of non-impact printing as 
described e.g. in " Principles of Non-impact Printing" by 
Jerome L. Johnson (1986) - Palatino Press - Irvine CA, 
92715 USA. Electrostatographic printing includes electrographic 
printing in which an electrostatic charge is deposited 
image-wise on a dielectric recording member as well as 
electrophotographic printing in which an overall 
electrostatically charged photoconductive dielectric 
recording member is image-wise exposed to conductivity 
increasing radiation producing thereby a "direct" or 
"reversal" toner-developable charge pattern on said 
recording member. Magnetic brush development is suited 
for "direct" as well as "reversal" development. "Direct" 
development is a positive-positive development, and is 
suited for producing pictures and text. "Reversal" development is a "positive-negative" or vice  
 
versa development process and is of particular interest 
when the exposure derives from an image in digital 
electrical form, wherein the electrical signals modulate 
a laser beam or the light output of light-emitting diodes 
(LEDs). It is advantageous with respect to a reduced 
load of the electrical signal modulated light source 
(laser or LEDs) to record graphic information (e.g. 
printed text) in such a way that the light information 
corresponds with the graphic characters so that by 
"reversal" development in the exposed area of a 
photoconductive recording layer, toner can be deposited 
to produce a positive reproduction of the electronically 
stored original. In high speed electrostatographic 
printing the exposure derives practically always from 
electronically stored, e.g. computer stored, information. As used herein, the term "electrostatographic" also 
includes the direct image-wise application of 
electrostatic charges on an insulating support, for 
example by ionography. In the electrophotographic art multi-colour printers are 
of two types. In multiple-pass single-station printers, 
image receiving material is passed repeatedly through a 
single image-producing station, each pass being used to 
print a different colour separation image. In single-pass 
multiple-station printers, image receiving material 
is passed once
