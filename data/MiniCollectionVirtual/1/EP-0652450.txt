<ABSTRACT>
It has been discovered that improved performance and reduced size can be 
realized in dual-mode fiber dispersion compensators by careful alignment of the mode 

pattern relative to the plane of the bend of the spooled fiber. In particular, minimum 
loss occurs when the null line of the LP₁₁ mode lies in the plane of the bend. 

Arrangements for insuring that the fiber assumes the correct orientation for minimum 
bending loss are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to optical transmission systems and, in particular, to 
arrangements for reducing the losses in dispersion compensators used in such systems. When optical waves of different wavelengths propagate along an optical fiber, 
they do so at different group velocities. This so-called chromatic, or group-velocity 
dispersion causes pulse broadening which limits the rate at which information can be 
carried through an optical fiber. Recently, there has been interest in dispersion 
compensators that use dual-mode fibers operated in the LP₁₁ spatial mode, close to 
their cutoff wavelength. Because higher-order spatial modes in optical fibers exhibit 
large, negative chromatic dispersion, such an arrangement provides a means for 
compensating for the positive dispersion in conventional single-mode fiber spans. See, 
for example, U.S. patent 5,185,827, issued February 9, 1993. The attractiveness of using a dual-mode fiber for dispersion compensation stems 
from the ability to achieve large negative waveguide dispersion by operating close to 
the cutoff wavelength of the LP₁₁ mode, thereby minimizing the amount of fiber 
required to compensate a given amount of positive dispersion. However, operation 
close to cutoff greatly increases sensitivity to bending losses, and it is these losses that 
place a practical limit on how much dispersion compensation can be realized. It is, accordingly, the object of the present invention to minimize bending 
losses in dual-mode fiber dispersion compensators. The present invention is based on the discovery that the anti-symmetric LP₁₁ 
mode has the interesting property that the loss induced by a fiber bend depends 
strongly on the orientation of the spatial mode pattern relative to the plane in which 
the fiber is bent. In particular, minimum loss occurs when the mode null lies in the  
 
plane of the bend. Thus, improved performance and reduced size can be realized in 
fiber dispersion compensators in accordance with the present invention. Arrangements for insuring that the fibers maintain the correct mode 
orientation are disclosed. FIG. 1 shows an illustrative optical fiber communication link to which the 
invention relates; FIG. 2 shows a bent fiber and the critical distance dc; FIGS. 3 and 4 show the effect mode orientation has upon fiber bending loss; FIG. 5 shows an illustrative arrangement for spooling a dispersion compensating 
fiber so as to minimize bending losses; FIG. 6 shows an optical fiber with an elliptical core; FIGS. 7 and 8 show the mode
