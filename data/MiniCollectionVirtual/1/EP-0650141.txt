<ABSTRACT>
The parking card comprising a circular flat plastic disc (1), with an embedded electronic chip for storage and processing of entered parking data. At the peripheral edge of the disc is a ring (2) of a different material, exhibiting a different stiffness and/or wear resistance to that of the central disc. Pref. the ring has a U-shaped cross-section for fitting around the complementary edge of the central disc. The opposing arms of the U lie flush with the surface of the disc, and project from this surface, or taper along their length between a point above the adjacent surface of the disc and a point in the plane of the disc surface.

<CLAIMS>
Parking token for operating a car park barrier requiring payment of a fee, in
the form of a round, flat plastics member having an integrated electronic component

for the user-related storage and optionally processing of parking data, 
characterized
in that
 the plastics member (1) has around its rim a circumferential ring (2)
of a material having a higher resistance to wear than the round plastics member

(1), the rim region undergoing, as a result of the ring (2), a change in its contours
which provides contact and/or slide surfaces for a separating operation.
Parking token according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the ring (2) has a
U-shaped cross-section having front face and rear face extensions (4, 5) that cover

a rim portion of the plastics member (1).
Parking token according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the front face and
rear face extensions (4, 5) of the ring (2) are flush with the front face and rear face

of the plastics member (1).
Parking token according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the front face
extension (4) and/or the rear face extension (5) of the ring (2) have or has a

wedge-shaped sectional shape, which increases or decreases in thickness radially.
Parking token according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

the ring (2) consists of sheet metal which forms a bead around the circumference
of the plastics member (1).
Parking token according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

the ring (2) consists of a resilient, shock-absorbing material which covers the
plastics member (1) around its circumference. 
Parking token according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that

the round plastics member (1) consists of a fibre-reinforced plastics material.
Parking token according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that

the plastics member (1), by means of the ring (2), tapers away radially to the
circumference.
