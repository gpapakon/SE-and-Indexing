<ABSTRACT>
A method for generating cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in cells containing mutant CFTR and methods for treating cystic fibrosis are described. The method for generating CFTR function in cells containing mutant CFTR involves contacting the cell with an agent which increases the level of mutant CFTR at cellular locations where wild-type CFTR normally functions such that the mutant CFTR generates functional ion channels or mediates ion transport at the cellular locations where wild-type CFTR normally functions. The methods for treating cystic fibrosis involve administering to a subject the above-described agent. Other aspects described include therapeutic compositions and packaged drugs.

 METHODS AND THERAPEUTIC COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING CYSTIC FIBROSISRelated Applications This application is a continuation-in-part application of USSN 08/072, 708, filed June 7, 1993, which is a continuation-in-part of USSN 07/935,603, filed August 26, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of USSN 07/613,592, filed November 15, 1990, which is in turn a continuation-in-part application of USSN 07/589,295, filed September 27, 1990, which is a continuation-in-part application of USSN 07/488,307, filed March 5, 1990. This application is also related to the subject matter described in co-pending application USSN 07/985,478 filed December 2, 1992. The contents of all of the above co-pending patent applications are incorporated herein by reference. Definitions of language or terms not provided in the present application are the same as those set forth in the copending applications. Any reagents or materials used in the examples of the present application whose source is not expressly identified also is the same as those described in the copending application, e.g., Î”F508 CFTR gene and CFTR antibodies.Background of the InventionCystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease in humans (Boat, T. et al. Cystic fibrosis. In: The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. C. Scriver, A. Beaudet, W. Sly, and D. Valle, eds. (McGraw Hill, New York, 1989), 2649-2860). Based on both genetic and molecular analysis, a gene associated with CF was isolated as part of 21 individual cDNA clones and its protein product predicted (Kerem, B-S. et al. Science 245:1073-1080 (1989); Riordan, J. et al. Science 245:1066-1073 (1989); Rommens, J.H. et al. Science 245:1059-1065 (1989).USSN 488,307 describes the construction of the gene into a continuous strand, expression of the gene as a functional protein and confirmation that mutations of the gene are responsible for CF. (See also Gregory, R.J. et al. Nature 347:382-386 (1990); Rich, D.P. et al. Nature 347:358-363 (1990)). The copending patent application also discloses experiments which showed that proteins expressed from wild type but not a mutant version of the cDNA complemented the defect in the cAMP regulated chloride channel shown previously to be characteristic of CF.The protein product of the CF associated gene is called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (Riordan, J. et al. Science 245:1066-1073 (1989)). CFTR is a protein of approximately 1480 amino acids made up of two repeated elements, each having six transmembrane segments and a
