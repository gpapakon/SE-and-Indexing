<ABSTRACT>
A coupling device for pipes such as staircase banisters, comprising two chuck devices (1, 2) expandable away from one another by means of screws (3) and which are disposed interiorly in those pipes which are to be coupled, and bridging the joint. The chuck devices (1, 2) have clamping surfaces (4) which are complementary to the interior surfaces of the pipes, and the pipes have aperturess for access of the screws (3). The clamping surfaces (4) are band-shaped and transversely directed in relation to the longitudinal direction of the coupling device and are spaced apart by recessed surface portions (5). The chuck devices (1, 2) are in the form of semicylindrical shell-shaped bodies with partly exteriorly transversely directed rigidifying beads whose peaks have the clamping surfaces, and partly interiorly longitudinal rigidifying beads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pipe coupling arrangement including two
chuck devices expandable away from one another by means of screws and
disposed interiorly in and bridging the joint between those pipes to be
coupled said chuck devices being substantially rigid and in the form of
substantially semi-cylindrical or part cylindrical shell shaped bodies, said
pipes having openings for access to the screws, said chuck devices having, on
the outside, projecting circumferentially extending rigidifying ribs the outer
surfaces thereof forming clamping surfaces substantially complementary to
the interior surfaces of the pipes, recessed surfaces being provided between
adjacent clamping surfaces.In the erection of pipe constructions such as staircase banisters,
balustrades and the like, the level of precision in mutually meeting pipe
ends is often so poor that there may be relatively large tension forces
inherent in the construction, for which reason the pipe ends must be forced
into correct connection or coupling positions. Furthermore, the tolerances
on mutually meeting pipe ends and their surface smoothness - in particular
interiorly - may be dubious in quality because of longitudinal weld seams,
hot galvanizing and the like. This places additional requirements that the
coupling device, against tension forces and despite the above-mentioned
configuration and dimension tolerances, must be capable of aligning
mutually meeting pipe ends so that the couplings or joints will exteriorly be
as smooth as possible, and also be capable, despite tensions in the
construction, of keeping mutually meeting pipes in place.In prior art designs and constructions, pipe couplings have often been
effected in such a manner that a plug is inserted in the one pipe end, the
plug being welded in place, whereafter the plug is inserted in the opposing
pipe end. Once the plug has been inserted in this manner in the pipe end,
one or more transverse bores are made through the pipe end and the plug
inserted therein is removed and closure pins driven into the thus formed
openings or bores. Such a connection does not realize sufficiently hard positional fixing and
centering of mutually meeting pipe ends. The result has rather tended to be
cracks and unevenness in the pipe coupling so that the coupling and the
plug ends inserted therein must often be filled or masked to conceal these
defects in precision.Nor does the above-described prior art coupling possess sufficient
mechanical strength but shows a tendency to become loose when the

on their mutually facing sides, with a longitudinal rigidifying rib (6) and that

the shell-shaped bodies are provided, on their mutually facing sides along
their longitudinal edges, with inwardly projecting rigidifying ribs (7) which

are substantially parallel with a longitudinal diameter plane to the coupling
device when this is located in clamping position in the pipes and that opposing

ends are connected via approximately circle-segment shaped end walls
(8).

rigidifying ribs are provided circumferentially and substantially transversely

in relation to the longitudinal direction of the chuck devices (1, 2).
The arrangement as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
rigidifying ribs are provided with a pitch in relation to the circumferential

direction or that they are waved or zigzag-shaped.
The arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1-3, 
characterized
 in that the radial thickness of the chuck devices (1, 2) at the clamping
surfaces (4) is approximately twice as large as therebetween.

characterized
 in that the coupling device has, when this is located in the clamping
position in the pipes, a substantially straight centre line. 
The arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1-4,

longitudinal axes in a longitudinal diameter plane to the coupling device.
The arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized

ends, when the coupling device is located in the clamping position in the

pipes, lie flush with or slightly inside the outer defining surface of the pipe.
