Device usable for combating insects, comprising:

- a transparent plastic container (1) in the form of a dish whose open face has a flat flange,
- a plastic sheet (3) impervious to liquids and permeable to the vapours of essential oils at ambient temperature, this sheet being attached to the flat flange of the transparent container and adhering to this transparent container so as not to be capable of being grasped manually or detached from the flat flange by pulling manually,
- a protective cover sheet (4) made of adhesive plastic, also arranged on the face of the transparent container which is provided with flat flanges, this sheet adhering to the above permeable sheet by adhesive bonding and being capable of being grasped manually or being detached from the flat flange by pulling manually,
- an insecticidal and/or insect-repellent composition (2), this composition being liquid capable of evaporating completely at ambient temperature and having an insecticidal and/or repellent activity in the vapour state and comprising an essential oil as well as a diffusion adjuvant, the amount of essential oil being from 20 to 85% and the amount of diffusion adjuvant being from 15% to 80%,
- optionally means for attaching and/or hanging the device and/or the transparent container,
- a cardboard package (5) folded in two, so as to contain within it the flat edges and the two, permeable and protective, sheets, the transparent dish being visible and transparent outside this cardboard package.
