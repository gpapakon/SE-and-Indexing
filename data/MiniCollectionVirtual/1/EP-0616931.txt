<ABSTRACT>
In an air brake system (10) of a commercial motor vehicle it is proposed by simple means to reduce the brake pressure on the wheel brake (22) when a sensor (54) detects excessive wear on the brake lining (55). In a control line (28), running between a brake valve (13) and the control chamber (30) of a relay valve (19) for controlling the brake pressure, a shut-off valve (32) is arranged. The latter is bypassed by a pressure-reducing valve device (39) and a non-return valve (37). When braking, the shut-off valve (32), in the presence of a wear-dependent signal, is switched into the closed position so that control air can pass into the control chamber (30) of the relay valve (19) only by way of the pressure-reducing valve device (39). As the shut-off valve (32) closes the control pressure is reduced by way of the non-return valve (37).
