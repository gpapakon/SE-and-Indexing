<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a packaging container having a 
tray (1) with a cover (2). The cover is sealed to the upper 

edge of the tray along a first seal (8) in the flange 
region (6) of said tray (1), the first seal (8) lying 

outside a line of weakening (7) formed in the cover. A 
second, peelable seal (9), either continuous with or 

separate from the first seal (8), is also provided between 
the cover (2) and the tray flange (6) and is positioned 

inwardly of the line of weakening (7). In this manner a 
tamper-evident yet efficient seal is provided in the 

container such that no additional membrane is required. The 
invention also relates to a method of manufacturing the 

container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a packaging container as defined
in the first part of claim 1 and to a method of producing
a packaging container as defined in the first part of claim
11.In US-A-3 483 964. a container is disclosed which
is essentially a blister package having a
cover sealed to a tray portion by a single strong seal. In
order to provide a sealed yet openable package, the single
seal is spaced outwardly of a score line running around the
package. The seal in this disclosure must not cross the
score line since this would, as stated in the document, re-strengthen
the score line and thus not readily permit
rupture thereof for opening the package.The problem of providing tamper evidence is present in many
packaging fields nowadays and has now also been seen as an
area of concern in for example margarine type packs,
commonly known as table packs. In these packs, a
replaceable cover or lid is provided on top of the tray
holding the product contents. Since easy access as well as
a gas-tight seal is required, a separate inner membrane
(e.g. made from a laminate of some type) is fitted in a
gas-tight manner to the top of the tray below the cover.
After removing the lid, the membrane is either pierced or
removed, whereupon the contents are accessible and the lid
merely needs to be replaced to provide a lightly re-closed
configuration. For the consumer it is thus impossible, 
without opening the lid before purchasing the container, to
detect whether the container has been opened. This is
similarly the case for those working at the check-out
counters who should warn purchasers in cases of visible
tampering. Skilful replacement of the membrane by a
tamperer would anyway normally avoid detection. A further document, US-A-2998158
corresponding to the first part of claim 1 and claim 11
discloses a tamper evident
structure having an outer permanent seal between a flange
of the cover and the lid thereof. Inside this seal there is
a line of weakening such that the outer seal can be removed
as a security band. When the band is removed a further
frictional seal connection is still maintained between the cover
and the container allowing the container to be opened and
reclosed.In US-A-4006839 a similar arrangement to that in
US-A-2998158 is disclosed, whereby a frictional engagement
is provided between the cover and the container when the
outer seal is removed. The frictional engagement between
the cover and the container is arranged as a snap-fit
closure allowing snap-fit reclosure of the container. The main problem

<CLAIMS>
Packaging container comprising a tray (1) and a cover
(2), said cover (2) being sealed to an upper edge (6) of

said tray along a first seal (8) in the flange region (6)
of said tray, wherein said first seal (8) lies outside a

line of weakening (7) in said cover (2), wherein
a second seal (9) is provided between the cover (2)

and the tray flange (6), 
characterized in that
 said second seal (9) is a
peelable, yet gas-tight seal positioned inside said line of

weakening (7).
Packaging container according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 said first seal (8) is a peelable seal.
Packaging container according to either of claims 1 or
2, 
characterized in that
 the line of weakening (7) lies in
an area of the cover which is not attached to the tray

flange (30) beneath it.
Packaging container according to either of claims 2 or
3, 
characterized in that
 said first seal (8) and said
second seal (9) are separated and in that said first seal

has a greater peel strength than said second seal.
Packaging container according to either of claims 1 or
2, 
characterized in that
 said first (8) and said second (9)
seals are formed by one continuous seal without a gap

therebetween, said line of weakening (7) thus forming the
delimitation between said first and second seals.
Packaging container according to any preceding claim,


characterized in that
 said line of weakening (7) has a 
starting point (A) and a finishing point (B) at the

outermost edge of the cover (2) and which extends first
inwardly to be located between said first (8) and second

seals (9).
Packaging container according to any preceding claim,

characterized in that
 said line of weakening (7) is a
perforation line (7, 7') extending through both said cover

(2) and said tray flange (6).
Packaging container according to any preceding claim,

characterized in that
 said line of weakening (7) is a
perforation line, and in that the finishing point (B) of

said perforated line (7) is separated from the starting
point (A) thereof so as to form a grip flap (17) for said cover for

opening of the second seal (9).
Packaging container according to any preceding claim,

characterized in that
 said cover has a lowered portion (20,
25) located inwardly of said second seal (9), and in that

said lowered portion allows reclosure of the container by
cooperation with corresponding means (26) on the tray

inside thereof.
Packaging container according to claim 9, 
characterized
in that
 said lowered portion (20) is at least one wall
portion of said cover, extending in a direction downwardly

and outwardly towards the periphery of the cover and which
cooperates with at least one similarly angled surface (26)

at the upper edge of the tray, said similarly angled
surface being a de-stacking protrusion.
Method of producing a packaging container comprising a
tray (1) and a corresponding cover (2), whereby said cover

is applied onto said tray and sealed to a flange portion
(6) thereof by a first seal (8) lying outside a line of 

weakening (7) formed in said cover close to its periphery,

characterized in that
 said cover (2) is sealed to said tray
(1) on the inner side of said line of weakening by an

inner, gas-tight and peelable second seal (9).
Method according to claim 11, 
characterized in that

said seals (8, 9) are formed by the use of one or more
sealing tools for forming said

seals (8, 9), said sealing tools having inner and outer
sealing tool portions separated by a distance so as to form

a gap therebetween for forming separated first and second
seals respectively, and in that the flange part (30) of the

tray that lies in said gap is not sealed to said cover (2).
Method according to either of claims 11 or 12,

characterized in that
 said cover (2) is formed of a
thermoformable material having heat sealable

characteristics at least in the regions of said first (8)
and second (9) seals.
