<DESCRIPTION>
 Thermostable xylanases from ThermotogaTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to novel enzymes. More specifically, the invention provides novel xylanases obtainable from microorganisms of the genus Thermotoga. The invention also relates to a process the for preparation of these xylanases, an agent containing these xylanases, and the use of these xylanases for treatment of lignocelluiosic pulp.BACKGROUND ARTXylan, a major component of plant hemicellulose, is a polymer of D- xylose linked by β-Λ ,4-xylosidic bonds. Xylan can be degraded to xylose and xylo- oligomers by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan produces free sugars without the by-products formed with acid (e.g. furans).The pulp and paper industry is using xylanase compositions in the bleaching process to enhance the brightness of bleached pulps, to decrease the amount of bleaching chemicals, e.g. chlorine, used in the bleaching stages, and to increase the freeness of pulps in the recycled paper process [Eriksson K.E.L. (1990), Wood Science and Technology 2479 -101.; Paice M.G., BernierR., and Jurasek L (1988), Biotechnol. and Bioeng., 32 235 - 239.; Pommier J.C., Fuentes J.L., and Goma G. (1989), Tappi Journal, 187 - 191.] Kraft pulping, a process widely used in the pulp and paper industry, involves the alkaline sulfate cooking of pulp to remove most of the lignin. The remaining pulp contains 2 - 5% of lignin, which gives the pulp a dark brown colour that has the tendency to darken in UV light or by oxidation. In order to obtain a white pulp for high quality paper, the brown colour is removed by a multi-stage bleaching process using bleaching chemicals, e.g. oxygen, ozone, hydrogenperoxide, chlorine and/or chlorine dioxide.Presently, there is much concern about the environmental impact of the toxic compounds generated from the bleaching process. Enzymes can aid in the removal 

 of lignin from the pulp without any harmful side products. Reports show that lignin in wood is linked to xylan [Eriksson 0. et al. (1980), Wood Sci. Technol., 14 267.; TakashiN., and Koshijiima T. (1988), Wood Sci. Technol., 22177 - 189]. By a limited hydrolysis of the xylan a greater release of lignin occurs during bleaching. Thus, by5 enzymatic treatment of the pulp prior to bleaching the amount of chemicals needed would in turn decrease [Viikari L et al. (1986), Proceedings of the 3rd International Symposium on Biotechnology in the Pulp and Paper Industry, 67].Characteristic of the above processes is the need for xylanases capable of exerting
