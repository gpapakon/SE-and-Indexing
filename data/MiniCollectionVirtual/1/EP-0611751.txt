<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 1-amino-1-cyanamido-2,2-dicyanoethylene, 
sodium salt of the formula 
U.S. Patent No. 4,783,468 discloses that 2-chloro-4,6-diamino-5-cyanopyrimidine is a 
valuable intermediate in the preparation of certain substituted 2,4-diamino-5-cyanopyrimidines 
that are useful as pesticides. Chem. Ber. 101, 1968, 1244-1249, teaches that 
this intermediate may be synthesized in high yield by treating a slurry of 1-amino-1-cyanamido-2,2-dicyanoethylene, 
sodium salt with excess hydrogen chloride in absolute 
ether. However this sodium salt precursor is only obtained in a modest yield of 28% by 
reaction of sodium cyanamide with 1-amino-1-ethoxy-2,2-dicyanoethylene (Chem. Ber. 
101, 1968, 1232-1241), and this latter compound itself is several steps removed from 
readily available starting materials. The number of steps and the low overall yield make the above process for the preparation 
of 1-amino-1-cyanamido-2,2-dicyanoethylene , sodium salt expensive and commercially 
unattractive. Thus there is a need for an improved process for the preparation of 
1-amino-1-cyanamido-2,2-dicyanoethylene, sodium salt from readily available starting 
materials which would have fewer steps and afford a higher overall yield. There has now been found a novel process by which 1-amino-1-cyanamido-2,2-dicyanoethylene, 
sodium salt can be prepared in good quality and yield in a single step from  
 
readily available starting materials. The present invention thus comprises a process for the 
preparation of 1-amino-1-cyanamido-2,2-dicyanoethylene, sodium salt which comprises 
reacting malononitrile with sodium dicyanamide at an elevated temperature and in the 
presence of an aprotic, dipolar solvent. The reaction of malononitrile with sodium dicyanamide to give the title compound is 
preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of 120-200° C, especially in the range 
of 130-180° C and most especially in the range of 140-155° C. Conveniently the reaction 
is carried out at the reflux temperature of the mixture at atmospheric pressure. However it 
may be carried out at reduced or elevated pressure if desired. Depending on the 
temperature, the reaction will be complete in from 10 minutes to 4 hours. The reaction 
time is not critical since the product has good stability under the reaction conditions. Preferred solvents for the reaction are N,N-di(C1-C4alkyl)amides such as dimethylformamide 
and dimethylacetamide, N-(C1-C4alkyl)C4-C5cyclic amides such as
