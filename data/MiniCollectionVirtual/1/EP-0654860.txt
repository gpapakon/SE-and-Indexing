<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a waterproofing assembly for 
a connector a housing of which is completely waterproofed. 

A rear rubber plug 39 is press-fitted in a rear cylindrical 
portion 28 of a housing 20 in which a female terminal 

metal fixture 30 connected to an electrical wire 38 is 
accommodated. A cap 50 is mounted on a front cylindrical 

portion 21 of the housing 20 while a front rubber plug 40 
is press-fitted in the front cylindrical portion 21. The 

front rubber plug 40 has first and second cylindrical 
portions 41 and 44 and a uniting portion 45 for sealingly 

coupling the portions 41 and 44. A rib 53 formed in the 
cap 50 is press-fitted in a clearance 43 in the front rubber 

plug 40 so that the cap 50 covers the front cylindrical 
portion 21.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a waterproofing assembly 
which waterproofs a cylindrical body such as a connector 
housing and the like. For convenience of explanation, a conventional 
connector will be described below by referring to FIGS. 
7 and 8. FIG. 7 is an exploded perspective view of 
a conventional connector and FIG. 8 is a longitudinal 
sectional view of the connector shown in FIG. 7, 
illustrating a process of fitting the connector. In FIG. 7, a connector 1 includes a box like 
housing 2 and a female terminal metal fixture 6 which is 
accommodated in the housing 2 and connected to an electrical 
cable 7. More particularly, the housing 2 is provided on its 
front and rear sides (left and right sides in the drawing) 
with an insertion port 3 for a male terminal metal fixture 
100 (FIG. 8) and an insertion port 4 for the female terminal 
metal fixture 6. The housing 2 is also provided in its 
interior with a terminal accommodating chamber 5. The 
female terminal metal fixture 6 is inserted through the 
insertion port 4 into the chamber 5. As shown in FIG. 8, the male terminal metal fixture 
100 electrically connected to a device 101 is inserted 
through the insertion port 3 into the housing 2 so that 
the fixture 100 is fitted to the fixture 6. In the conventional connector 1 described above, 
since the insertion port 3 which communicates with the 
chamber 5 in the housing 2 is exposed outwardly, water 
may enter the chamber 5 through the port 3 to corrode the 
fixture 6 in the chamber 5. It will be possible to waterproof the connector 1 by 
attaching a cap to the front end of the housing 2 when the 
connector 1 is not used. However, the cap must be detached 
from the housing when the connector 1 is used. This will  
 
make handling of the connector troublesome. We are aware of US Patent 4 932 875 which discloses a connector 
assembly which has been used to form the characterising part of our 
claim 1. The connector disclosed in the prior citation serves to provide a 
waterproof function when the terminal metal fixture is inserted into the 
insertion part in the cap, but does not provide this function when the 
terminal fixture is not so inserted. An object of the present invention is to provide a waterproofing 
assembly for a connector, which can completely and easily waterproof a 
connector housing and the like. In order to achieve the above object, we provide a waterproofing 
assembly for a connector which has a cylindrical housing accommodating 
a first thin plate like terminal metal fixture and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A waterproofing assembly (10) for a connector which has a 
cylindrical housing (20) accommodating a first thin plate like terminal metal 

fixture (100) and a second terminal metal fixture (30) adapted to be 
detachably coupled to said first terminal metal fixture (100), comprising: 


a front rubber plug (40) adapted to be sealingly press-fitted in a front 
opening end portion (21) of said housing (20), said plug (40) including a first 

cylindrical portion (41) having a slit (42) to allow said first terminal metal 
fixture (100) to pass through, a second cylindrical portion (44) provided 

around said first cylindrical portion, and a uniting portion (45) for sealingly 
interconnecting said first (41) and second (44) cylindrical portions; 
a cap (50) including an insertion port (51) adapted to receive said first 
terminal metal fixture (100) and a rib (53) projecting from an outer periphery 

of said insertion port (51) to an interior of said cap (50), and 
a rear rubber plug (39) adapted to be sealingly press-fitted in a rear 
opening end portion (28) of said housing (20), said rear rubber plug (39) 

holding an electrical wire (38) connected to said second terminal metal 
fixture (30); 
 
   characterised in that said cap (50) is adapted to cover said front 

opening end portion (21) of said housing (20) when said rib (53) is inserted 
into a clearance (43) between said first and second cylindrical 

portions (41,44) to sealingly close said slot even if the first terminal metal 
fixture is not inserted into the insertion port in the cap. 
A waterproofing assembly according to claim 1, wherein said first 
terminal metal fixture (100) is a male terminal metal fixture and said second 

terminal metal fixture (30) is a female terminal metal fixture. 
A waterproofing assembly according to claim 1, wherein said 
housing (20) consists of a cylindrical united body and is provided on its  

 
front side with a front cylindrical portion (21), on its middle position with a 

base portion (24) contiguous to said front cylindrical portion (21), and on its 
rear side with a rear cylindrical portion (28) contiguous to said base 

portion (24), wherein said front cylindrical portion (21) has an opening (22) 
being large enough to receive said front rubber plug (40) compressively and 

is provided on its upper and lower faces with a projection (23) for locking 
said cap (50), wherein said base portion (24) has a terminal accommodating 

chamber (25) for said second terminal metal fixture (30) in communication to 
said opening (22) in said front cylindrical portion (21), wherein said rear 

cylindrical portion (28) has a diameter being larger than that of said base 
portion (24), receives said second terminal metal fixture (30) through an 

insertion port (29) for said second terminal metal fixture (30) and then 
receives said rear rubber plug (39) compressively. 
A waterproofing assembly according to claim 1, wherein said front 
rubber plug (40) includes a first cylindrical portion (41) with a slit (4
2) and a

clearance around said first cylindrical portion (41), wherein said first and 
second cylindrical portions (41,44) have the same length and are sealingly 

interconnected at their rear ends by a uniting portion (45), wherein an 
exterior configuration of said second cylindrical portion (44) coincides with 

an interior configuration of said opening (22) in said front cylindrical

cylindrical portion (44) is slightly larger than an inner diameter of said 
opening (22) so that said front rubber plug (40) is compressively inserted into 

said front cylindrical portion (21). 
A waterproofing assembly according to claim 1, wherein said 
cap (50) is formed into a cylindrical body to cover said front cylindrical 

portion (21) of said housing (20), wherein said cap (50) is provided at a center
