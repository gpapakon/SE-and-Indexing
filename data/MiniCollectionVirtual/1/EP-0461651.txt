<ABSTRACT>
A recording medium which comprises a support having 
thereon a layer containing an electron-donating achromatic 

dye incorporated in microcapsules and an electron-accepting 
compound, wherein said electron-accepting compound is a 3-halo-4-hydroxybenzoic 

acid ester having a polymerizable 
ethylene group. The recording medium provides a high color 

density at image part, a low fog density at non-image part 
and markedly high stability of the non-image part.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording medium which 
can be applied to recording paper for use in facsimile, 
printer paper and the like, film for presentation use, 
recording film for medical use, proof for print proofing and 
the like. More particularly, it relates to a light- and 
heat-sensitive recording medium in which the stability of 
non-image portions is improved. Recording media which employ an electron-donating 
achromatic dye and an electron-accepting compound include 
pressure-sensitive paper, thermosensitive paper, light- and 
pressure-sensitive paper, electric heat-sensitive paper, 
thermosensitive transfer paper, and the like, and are 
disclosed in detail, for example, in GB-A-2140449, US-A-4480052 
and 4436920, JP-B-60-123556 and JP-A-57-179836, 
60-123556 and 60-123557. JP-A-61-14981 discloses the use 
of 2-alkoxy-hydroxybenzoic acid esters having an alkenyl 
substituent as electron-accepting compounds. Such prior art recording media in which an electron-donating 
leuco dye and an electron-accepting compound are 
used have a disadvantage in that non-image portions 
inadvertently develop color caused by heating and the like 
after image recording. Consequently, intensive studies have  
 
been and continue to be conducted in the field with the aim 
of solving this problem. As an attempt to improve stability of recording 
media, a recording medium in which an electron-donating 
achromatic dye is encapsulated in microcapsules has been 
proposed to insulate an electron-accepting compound from the 
achromatic dye as disclosed in JP-A-2-81671. However, 
satisfactory shelf life of images cannot be obtained even by 
the use of this method. As a method for the development of image by uniform 
heating of a recording medium after image exposure, a process 
has been proposed in which a photo-polymerizable composition 
and heat-sensitive coloring medium are used and a visible 
image is formed by heat developing treatment. According to 
this process, the photo-polymerizable composition is 
encapsulated in microcapsules, and as a result, the cured 
portions of the photo-polymerizable composition after image 
exposure are insulated from contact with the heat-sensitive 
coloring material so as to prevent color development in the 
cured portions. By this process, however, development of 
color on the photo-cured portions cannot be prevented 
satisfactorily at the time of the heat developing treatment, 
and, consequently, development of fog occurs on non-image 
portions. In addition, another method has
