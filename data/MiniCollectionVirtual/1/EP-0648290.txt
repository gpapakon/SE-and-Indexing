<CLAIMS>
Rail fastening with a securing bolt passing through a 
resilient member made of plastics, forming a span 

between a rail foot and a support on a support sleeper, 
and anchored in support sleeper, characterised in that 

the resilient member is in the form of a resilient 
plate (5, 15, 25), and has a nose (26, 28) projecting 

downwards from the underside of said resilient plate, 
and clampable on the rail foot (1), and the support (8, 

16, 23) is in the form of a raised portion on the 
support sleeper (6, 17, 21), the underside of the 

resilient plate and the upper side of the support being 
spaced apart by a certain distance (a, b) when the 

securing bolt is not clamped, but the nose is in 
contact. 
Rail fastening according to claim 1, characterised in 
that at the resilient plate (5, 15), the height of the 

nose (26, 28) and the size of its support surface on 
the surface of the rail foot (1) may be determined in 

dependence on a predefined clamping force of the 
securing bolt (3, 11). 
Rail fastening according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the resilient plate (5, 15, 25) consists of 

thermoplastic polyurethane. 
Rail fastening according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a metal member distributing the 

clamping forces is located between the resilient plate 
(5, 15, 25) and the securing bolt (3, 11).  

 
Rail fastening according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that there is located laterally of the 

rail foot (1) a plastic strip (14) projecting upwards 
beyond said rail foot (1), and which if necessary can 

be left open in the region of a plug anchorage (7). 
Rail fastening according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the resilient plate (5) is 

provided with a slot (9) extending transversely to the 
rail foot, allowing the securing bolt (3) to pass 

through. 
Rail fastening according to claim 6, characterised in 
that, in a pre-assembly position (Figure 2), the 

resilient plate (5) is rotated with the nose (26) to 
the support sleeper (6), and is blocked in a position 

leaving the rail foot (1) free. 
Rail fastening according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that a rib (16) located on the support 

sleeper (6, 17), or the surface (8) of the sleeper 
support, serves as a support for the resilient plate 

(5, 15, 25) on the sleeper support (6, 17). 
Utilisation of a resilient plate according to claim 1 
for a rail fastening with increased resistance to 

transverse displacement and simultaneous securing 
against rotation of the resilient plate (25) by 

positive fixing of the nose (22) on an abutment (23) 
spaced apart from the rail foot (1), said abutment 

being designed as a raised portion on the sleeper 
support (21) .
