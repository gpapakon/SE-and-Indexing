<ABSTRACT>
A method for performing intrastromal photorefractive 
keratectomy in the cornea (12) of an eye, using a pulsed laser 

beam, includes the initial step of focusing the beam to a 
spot size at a start point (42) in the stroma (22). The start point 

is located in the stroma and at a predetermined distance 
behind the epithelium (18) of the cornea. Beginning with the 

start point, a volume of stromal tissue which is 
substantially equal to the volume of the spot size is 

disrupted by the laser beam. Importantly, the 
photodisruption is accomplished using an irradiance for the 

beam which is less than ten times greater the threshold for 
optical breakdown of the stromal tissue. Subsequently, the 

beam is focused in a patterned sequence to spot sizes at 
other discrete points in the stroma. At each point the 

stromal tissue is photodisrupted. With this progressive 
pattern of photodisruption, each spot is placed 

substantially adjacent a volume of previously disrupted 
tissue. The resultant photodisrupted tissue creates a 

layer (52) which is substantially centro-symmetrical around the 
optical axis and in which all points in the layer are 

substantially equidistant from the epithelium. A plurality 
of layers (52,54,56) can be created.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of using a pulsed laser to 
alter visually transparent matter. It is known that the cornea of an eye can, in certain instances, be 
surgically reshaped to correct and improve vision. Indeed, as more fully 
set forth below, there are several different types of ophthalmic surgical 
procedures which can be employed for this purpose. Although the types 
of procedures may vary, the ultimate object is the same. Namely, the 
object is to reduce the thickness of the cornea so that it properly refracts 
light entering the eye for subsequent focusing on the retina of the eye. A well known surgical operation for reshaping the cornea of an eye 
is the procedure known as radial keratotomy. This procedure, which is 
used primarily to correct myopia, is performed by making a series of 
radial incisions on the surface of the cornea. These incisions extend from 
the outer edge of the cornea toward its center in spoke-like fashion to 
weaken selected sections of the cornea. With these weakened sections, the 
fluid pressure of the aqueous humor inside the eye will cause the cornea 
to deform. As intended for this procedure, the desired deformation is a 
flattening of the cornea to provide proper light refraction for improved 
vision. In recent years, the use of cutting tools to make incisions into the 
cornea for vision corrections is  
 
gradually being replaced or supplemented by the use of new 
surgical procedures using laser beams. Rather than making 
incisions, laser beams which reshape the cornea do so by 
actually removing corneal tissue. This is accomplished by 
a process which is generally known as photoablation. 
Heretofore, the photoablation of corneal tissue has been 
accomplished primarily by focussing laser beams onto the 
exposed anterior surface of the eye. The result which can 
be achieved is dependent on two interrelated factors. 
First, the particular laser system which is employed to 
generate a laser beam will significantly affect how the 
photoablation process can be accomplished. Second, the 
method by which the laser beam is manipulated to accomplish 
photoablation will effectively determine the efficacy of 
the procedure. For ophthalmic laser systems, several different types 
of laser beams have been suggested. For example, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,665,913 which issued to L'Esperance, Jr. for 
an invention entitled "Method for ophthalmological Surgery" 
discloses a corneal reshaping procedure using an excimer 
laser. As another example, U.S. Patent No. 4,907,586
