<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use, for the salting and preservation of meat products, of a composition comprising sodium chloride and at least two salts chosen from magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and potassium chloride, sodium chloride representing at least 50% by weight of the composition, whereas the magnesium chloride represents at most 30% by weight of this composition and the calcium chloride represents at most 10% by weight thereof, the balance for 100% consisting essentially of potassium chloride.

<CLAIMS>
Use, for salting and preserving prepared pork
products, of a composition comprising, in the crystallised

state, sodium chloride and at least two salts selected from

among magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and potassium
chloride, sodium chloride representing at least 50 wt.% of

the composition, while magnesium chloride represents at most
30 wt.% of this composition and calcium chloride represents

at most 10 wt.% thereof, the total being made up to 100 %
substantially by potassium chloride.
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that said
salting composition comprises at most 15 wt.% of magnesium

chloride.
