<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the treatment of fly ash of a refuse incineration plant, in which the fly ash is brought into contact with an acid in an amount such that a pH of 2 to 5 is established, heavy metals contained in the fly ash are dissolved out by the acid and the remaining solid residue is separated off. The object of the invention is to propose a measure using which on the one hand the proportion of dissolved fly ash is reduced and on the other hand the proportion of heavy metals leached out is increased. The object is achieved according to the invention by the acid used being sulphuric acid.

<CLAIMS>
Method of treating flue ash of a refuse
incinerator, wherein


the flue ash is brought into contact with such a
quantity of an acid that a pH value of between 2 and 5 is

set,
heavy metals contained in the flue ash are
eliminated with the acid, and
the remaining solid residue is separated-out,
characterized in that sulphuric acid is used as the acid.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
flue gas of a refuse incinerator


is subjected to a first wet wash, in which the
hydrochloric acid portion of the flue gas is removed,

then
is subjected to a second wet wash, in which, by the
addition of a metal hydroxide solution, the sulphur dioxide

portion of the flue gas is removed, a metal sulphate
solution being produced from the metal hydroxide solution

and the sulphur dioxide under oxidation conditions,
the metal sulphate solution is subjected to an
electrodialysis with a bipolar diaphragm, the metal

sulphate solution being separated into the metal hydroxide
solution and sulphuric acid, and
the sulphuric acid being used to treat the flue
ash.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that
the metal hydroxide is sodium hydroxide.
Method according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in
that the metal hydroxide solution is recycled into the

second wet wash.
