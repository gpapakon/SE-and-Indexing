<ABSTRACT>
The vacuum chamber has at least one ceramic isolating cylinder whose ends are closed with covers, movable and fixed contact parts on movable and fixed contact stems passing through the covers sand a vacuum-tight sealing element permitting movement of the movable contact stem. The covers (16) are bowl-shaped with their thinner free edges (19) soldered to the isolating cylinders with supporting rings (20) between. The sealing element has at least one and pref. two layers joined vacuum-tight at their free ends both together and to the cover or contact stem (15).

<CLAIMS>
A vacuum chamber with at least one insulating cylinder (11) made of ceramic
material, whose face ends are closed off by means of a cover (16, 40) each, 
with
a movable contact element attached to a movable contact stem (15) and with a

fixed contact element attached to a fixed contact stem, which each penetrate the
cover (16, 40), and with a vacuum-tight sealing element (34, 50, 60, 70) which is

fastened between the one cover (16, 40) and the movable contact stem (15) and
which permits a movement of the contact stem (15), with the covers (16, 40)

being tightly soldered to the respective face end of the adjacent insulating
cylinder (11) by interposing at least one supporting ring (20) and with the sealing

element (34, 50, 60, 70) being fastened to the cover (16) and the contact stem
(15), 
characterized in that
 the covers (16, 40) are provided with a cup-like
arrangement and comprise an edge (19, 45) which is thinner relative to the

remainder of the area, and that the sealing element (34, 50, 60, 70) comprises
two or more layers which are connected, and especially welded, with their free

ends in a vacuum-tight manner with each other and with the cover (16, 40) and
the contact stem (15), respectively.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the sealing
element is an at least two-layer bellows (50).
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the sealing
element is an at least two-layer membrane (70).
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the sealing
element is composed of at least two membranes (64, 65, 66; 67, 68, 69) which

have the shape of a truncated cone, are arranged relative to each other in the
manner of a disk spring, are each of two or more layers and are mutually welded

in a vacuum-tight manner at locations where the individual membranes touch
each other.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

the supporting ring comprises a section 820) which extends at a small distance
parallel to the inside surface of the edge, so that a cylindrical gap is formed 

between the two which is filled with solder.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the length (I) of
the section (19) of the edge having the thinner wall thickness is dimensioned in

such a way that it absorbs axial collapsing or buckling forces, but that it
comprises sufficient elasticity for compensating different thermal expansions of

the cover (16, 40) and the ceramic material (11).
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the supporting
ring has an L-shaped cross section whose radial web (21) extends between the

free edge of the cover (16) and the face surface of the insulating cylinder (11)
and its axial web (22) extends parallel and adjacent to the inside surface of the

edge section (19).
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized in that
 a screen (26) is
attached to the supporting ring (20), which screen extends parallel to the sealing

element (34).
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the supporting
ring and the screen are of an integral arrangement.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

the supporting ring is arranged and configured by means of a groove-like
arranged solder (43, 44) between the inside and outside surface of the edge of

the cover (40) and the face side of the insulating cylinder, with the solder
covering a region of the outside and inside surface of the wall section (19) which

is sufficient to absorb pressure forces.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the free edge of
the cover is soldered via the supporting ring directly on the face edge of the

insulating cylinder (11).
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the free edge of
the cover is fastened by interposing a ring plate made of copper which extends 

radially in addition to the supporting ring.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the ring plate
projects into the interior of the vacuum chamber and is used for holding further

components, e.g. a screen.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the cover consists of steel.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that

the supporting ring consists of copper.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 a
cover is provided which is partly formed of ceramic material to which a cup-like

cover part made of steel is connected.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 16, 
characterized in that
 the ceramic
cover section is provided with the shape of a truncated cone or arch, to whose

edge of lower diameter there is adjacently disposed a radial section to which the
cover section made of metal is fastened.
A vacuum chamber as claimed in claim 17, 
characterized in that
 the ceramic
cover section is shaped on the insulating cylinder.
