<ABSTRACT>
Oligonucleotide which can be used as a promoter non-template strand in the transcription of a sequence of a nucleotide target, in the presence of a phage RNA polymerase chosen from those of phages whose RNA polymerases have specific promoters comprising a concensus sequence at least from position -17 to position -1, wherein:   - the oligonucleotide comprises a core sequence flanked, at one of its ends at least, by a nucleotide sequence capable of hybridisation with a sequence of the target, - the abovementioned core sequence consists of a sequence of 6 to 9 consecutive nucleotides chosen from within the region -12 to -4 of the non-template strand of the abovementioned specific promoter, or a sufficiently homologous sequence enabling the functionality of the abovementioned RNA polymerase to be preserved, - one flanking sequence is complementary to a first region of the target, and the other flanking sequence, when it is present, is complementary to a second region of the target, the aforementioned first and second regions being separated on the target by a sequence having a number of nucleotides equal to the number of nucleotides in the core sequence, - and the number of nucleotides in the flanking region, or the sum of the number of nucleotides in the flanking regions, is at least sufficiently high for the abovementioned oligonucleotide to be able to hybridise with the target at the temperature of use of the RNA polymerase.   Such an oligonucleotide enables transcription to be initiated at a site of the target which is not normally a transcription initiation site for the abovementioned RNA polymerase.
