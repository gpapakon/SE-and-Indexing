<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for heating or cooling of flat glass sheets or strips, in which the glass is blown on both sides with a treatment gas, with a treatment zone for the glass surface moved longitudinally approximately in its plane, with nozzle ribs (5), arranged on both sides of the glass surface and running transversely to the direction of movement of the glass surface, for blowing out the treatment gas, and with a number of fans (6) for generating the treatment gas stream supplied to the nozzle ribs, with the special feature that, as fans (6), at least two cross-flow fans are provided per treatment zone, which are arranged in the vicinity of one or both longitudinal edges of the treatment zone and/or close to the longitudinal central axis (8) of the treatment zone, with the fan axis (7) running approximately parallel to the direction of movement of the glass surface (10).

<CLAIMS>
Device for heating or for cooling plate-shaped or
strip-shaped flat glass in which the glass is jet-blown

on both sides with a treatment gas, having at
least one treatment zone for the glass surface

moved along approximately in its plane, having
nozzle ribs (5) for blowing out the treatment gas

arranged on both sides of the glass surface and
extending transversely with respect to the

direction of motion of the glass surface and having
a plurality of fans (6) for producing the stream of

treatment gas fed to the nozzle ribs, characterised
in that for the fans (6) per each treatment zone at

least two cross-flow fans are provided which are
arranged in the vicinity (Figs 1, 2) of one or both

longitudinal edges of the treatment zone and/or
close to the central longitudinal axis (8) of the

treatment zone with the fan axis (7) extending
approximately parallel to the direction of motion

(9) of the glass surface (10, Fig 5).
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
for each treatment zone a cross-flow fan (6 o) is

provided for one side of the flat glass and a
cross-flow fan (6 u) is provided for the other side

of the flat glass (Fig 1).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the width (L) of each cross-flow fan (6)

occupies the greatest part of the length (Z) of a
treatment zone (Figs 2, 3, 4).
Device according to at least one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the direction of

motion (9) of the glass surface is horizontal or
approximately horizontal. 
Device according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the treatment zone or

an adjoining of such zones is constructed as a
closed treatment space (11, Fig 1).
Device according to Claim 5, characterised in that
a closed treatment gas circuit is provided.
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following
claims, characterised in that the cross-flow fans

(6) are oriented in such a way that their blowout
connecting piece (12) is directed substantially

towards the glass surface (10) and their intake
connecting piece (13) is directed approximately

perpendicularly thereto into the treatment space
(11).
Device according to Claim 7, characterised in that
a diffuser-shaped, widening blowout channel (14)

links the blowout connecting piece (12) to the
nozzle ribs (5).
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following
claims, characterised in that connected ahead of

the intake connecting piece (13) of the cross-flow
fan (6) is an intake channel (15) in which a

heating or cooling element (16) is arranged.
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following
claims, characterised in that rollers (17),

preferably driven ones, are provided for guiding
the glass surfac
e(s) (10) (Fig 5).
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following
claims, characterised in that inside a treatment

zone or a single-chamber device, cross-flow fans
(6) together with blowout channels (14) with

associated nozzle ribs (5l, 5r) are provided at 
both longitudinal edges of the treatment zone (11)

(Figs 3, 4).
Device according to Claim 11, characterised in that
nozzle ribs (5) proceeding from opposite (Fig 3)

blowout channels (14) are aligned in pairs with one
another and terminate in the vicinity of the

central longitudinal axis (4) of the device (Fig
3).
Device according to Claim 11, characterised in that
the nozzle ribs (5) of blowout channels (14)

situated opposite one another are arranged
interleaved with one another and terminate at the

respective opposite longitudinal edge of the
treatment region (Fig 4).
Device according to Claim 10 with reference to
Claim 1 or one of the following claims,

characterised in that the nozzle ribs (5) in
association with the respective spacings and

diameters of the rollers (17) as well as the wall
on the nozzle rib side of the intake channel (15)

are designed in such a way and are of such a size
that no direct radiation exchange can take place

between the heating or cooling elements (16) and
the glass surface (10) (lower half of Fig 5).
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following
claims, characterised in that the nozzle ribs (5)

are provided with slit nozzles, preferably one
single continuous slit.
Device according to Claim 1 or one of the following
claims, characterised by the use for ceramic goods

to be treated.
