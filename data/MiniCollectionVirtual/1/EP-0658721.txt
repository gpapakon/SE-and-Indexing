<CLAIMS>
Illuminating device, in particular for use in 
visual quality inspections, having at least one light 

source (2), and at least one deflecting reflector (3) and 
at least one reflecting surface (4), the light which 

radiates from the light source (2) onto the deflecting 
reflectors being deflected onto the reflecting surface, 

from which it as well as the light radiating from the 
light source (2) directly onto the reflecting surface (4) 

is reflected onto the surface to be illuminated, which is 
situated outside the device, characterized in that the at 

least one light source (2), the at least one deflecting 
reflector (3) and the at least one reflecting surface (4) 

are connected to one another to form an assembly. 
Illuminating device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the light source is a luminaire (2) with 

an essentially rectangular front surface. 
Illuminating device according to one of Claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that the deflecting reflector (3) 

is fastened to the light source. 
Illuminating device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the reflecting 

surface (4) is arranged in the deflecting reflector (3). 
Illuminating device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the reflecting 

surface (4) is a light sail. 
Illuminating device according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the light sail comprises individual 

reflecting vanes (7). 
Illuminating device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the reflecting  

 
surface (4) can be adjusted relative to the beam path of 

the light. 
Illuminating device according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the individual reflecting vanes (7) can 

be adjusted relative to the beam path of the light. 
Illuminating device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a dim-out cap (8) 

is arranged in the deflecting reflector (3). 
Illuminating device according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the dim-out cap (8) is adjustable. 
Illuminating device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the assembly is 

fastened to a supporting structure (10). 
Illuminating device according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that the supporting structure is produced 

from lightweight sections. 
Illuminating device according to one of Claims 11 
or 12, characterized in that a switch gear cabinet (13) 

for the illuminating device is fastened to the supporting 
structure.
