<ABSTRACT>
A clamp rod (20) is inserted into a through hole (2) of 
a base (1). The rod (20) is provided with a first external 

thread (21) adapted to engage with a clamping internal 
thread (11a) of a metal mold (11) and a second external 

thread (22) adapted to engage with a raising and lowering 
internal thread (12a). When the metal mold (11) is fixedly 

secured to the base (1), the rod (20) is rotated by an 
impact wrench (28). Thereupon, the rod (20) is screwed 

downward along the raising and lowering internal thread 
(12a) and then along the clamping internal thread (11a). 

Thereby, the base (1) is pressed downward by a pressing 
portion (23) of the rod (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamping apparatus of the 
screw engaging type, and more specifically to a clamping 
apparatus of the type adapted to fixedly secure a metal mold 
and the like to a base by screwing and threadably engaging 
an external thread of a clamp rod with an internal thread 
formed in the metal mold and the like. The state of the art is indicated by DE-U-8100622, which 
discloses a clamping apparatus which includes a base provided 
with a through hole and is suitable for clamping a first internally 
threaded member arranged to face one end side of the through 
hole, the apparatus further comprising a second member 
resiliently supported by the base on the other end side of 
the through hole and a clamp rod inserted into the through 
hole with an alignment clearance provided therebetween, the 
clamp rod comprising a first external thread adapted to 
engage with the first internally threaded member. The invention is characterised relative to that state of the 
art by an internal threading on the second member, a second 
external thread adapted to engage with the second, 
internally threaded, member, a pressing portion adapted to 
press the base from the other end side of the through hole 
and a portion adapted to be rotated by a rotating means 
supported by the base, whereby when a screw thrust not less 
than a predetermined value is imposed from the second 
external thread to the second internally threaded member, 
this thread and member can be disengaged from each other.  
 It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
clamping apparatus which is capable of exerting a large 
clamping force. It is another object of the present invention to prevent 
a damage of a clamping apparatus which might be caused by an 
axis misalignment. For accomplishing the above-mentioned objects, a 
clamping apparatus of the screw engaging type is constituted 
as follows, for example as illustrated in Figs. 1 through 4, 
in Figs. 5 and 6, in Figs. 7 through 9, in Figs. 10 through 
13, in Fig. 14, in Fig. 15 or in Fig. 16 respectively. A through hole 2 is formed in a base 1, a first 
internally threaded member 11 is arranged to face one end 
side of the through hole 2, a second internally threaded 
member 12 is supported on the other end side of the through 
hole 2 by the base 1, and a clamp rod 20 is inserted into 
the hole 2 with an alignment clearance C provided 
therebetween. The clamp rod 20 is provided with a first 
external thread 21 adapted to engage with the first 
internally threaded

<CLAIMS>
A clamping apparatus which includes a base (1) provided with 
a through hole (2) and is suitable for clamping a first internally 

threaded member (11) arranged to face one end side of the 
through hole (2), the apparatus further compris
ing a second 
member (12) resiliently supported by the base (1) on the 

other end side of the through hole (2) and a clamp rod (20) 
inserted into the through hole (2) with an alignment 

clearance (C) provided therebetween, the clamp rod (20) 
comprising a first external thread (21) adapted to engage 

with the first internally threaded member (11) characterised 
by: an internal threading (12a) on the second member (12), a second 

external thread (22) adapted to engage with the second 
internally threaded member (12), a pressing portion (23) 

adapted to press the base (1) from the other end side of the 
through hole (2) and a portion (24) adapted to be rotated by 

a rotating means (28) supported by the base (1), whereby 
when a screw thrust not less than a predetermined value is 

imposed from the second external thread (22) to the second 
internally threaded member (12), this thread (22) and member 

(12) can be disengaged from each other. 
A clamping apparatus according to claim 1, wherein there 
is provided a spring (13) for resiliently urging the second 

internally threaded member (12) radially inward. 
A clamping apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein a transmission cylinder (31) is disposed between an 

output portion (30) of the rotating means (28) and the 
rotated portion (24) so that the rotated portion (24) can be 

engaged with a hole (33) of the transmission cylinder (31) 
to be rotated and to be vertically movable.  

 
A clamping apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein a tapered lead portion (26) is provided at a leading 

end of the first external thread (21), and an outer diameter 
(d) of the lead portion (26) is set to a smaller value than 

a minor diameter (D) of a clamping internal thread (11a) of 
the first internally threaded member (11). 
A clamping apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein a clamping housing (3) is mounted to the base (1) on 

the other end side thereof, the rotating means (28) and the 
second internally threaded member (12) being supported by 

the housing (3), a resilient member (4,71,76) being disposed 
at least either between the base (1) and the housing (3) or 

between the housing (3) and the rotating means (28).
