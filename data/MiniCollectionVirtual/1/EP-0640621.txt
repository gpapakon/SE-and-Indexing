<ABSTRACT>
A novel anti-thrombin monoclonal antibody is 
prepared by using thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) 

as an antigen; by using the monoclonal antibody, rapid, 
exact and simpl
e immunoassay for not only TAT but also 
thrombin itself is possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-thrombin 
monoclonal antibody, which is useful as a reagent for 
immunoassay, for example, for quantitative determination 
of thrombin-antithrombin III complex or thrombin in plasma 
or serum. Thrombin plays an important role in the system of 
blood coagulation, and its measurement is considered 
important in diagnosis and remedy of various diseases. To 
measure components in living organisms, 
immunoassay is employed in many cases.
 
In order to attain exact measurement of the component, 
preparation of an anti-thrombin monoclonal antibody is 
indispensable. However, since thrombin has a weak immunogenicity 
and is unstable, it is impossible to prepare the 
monoclonal antibody, using it as an antigen. Nobody has 
succeeded in immunoassay for thrombin and thrombin-anti-thrombin 
III complex using the monoclonal antiboby, 
though desired by many people in this technical field.  The present invention has been attained on such a 
technical level. As described above, a hybridoma capable 
of producing an anti-thrombin monoclonal antibody that may 
be used in immunoassay for thrombin-antithrombin III 
complex and for thrombin has heretofore been unknown, and 
the present invention is the first that has obtained the 
hybridoma. A small amount of circulating prothrombin is 
converted into thrombin after the start and the activation 
of the blood coagulation mechanism, in which, however, 
thrombin immediately forms a 1/1 (by mol) complex with 
antithrombin III (hereinafter referred to as ATIII). It is presumed that some behavior 
of coagulation of circulating blood may be known by 
measuring the amount of the thrombin-antithrombin complex 
(hereinafter referred to as TAT) in blood. Therefore, it 
is possible to clarify the condition of the disease of a 
patient from the side of blood coagulation and to foresee 
the formation of thrombus or the disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC) in its early 
stages. In ordinary immunoassay kits for TAT, an 
thrombin specific polyclonal antibody is applied to the 
antibody fixed to a solid phase so as to evade the cross  
 
reaction with prothrombin in plasma. However, the 
polyclonal antibody used therein have various problems in 
that the specificity and the reactivity of the antibody 
are not always constant, the necessary amount of the 
antibody cannot always be ensured, and the absorbing 
operation is necessary so as to evade the cross reaction 
with prothrombin. We, the present inventors have 
attempted to produce a
