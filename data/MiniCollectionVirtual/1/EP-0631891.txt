<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to suspension 
systems for motor vehicles. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to an adjustable attachment for securing a 
stabiliser bar to a vehicle. Torsional stabiliser bars have proven useful in 
vehicles for many years. Such stabiliser bars commonly 
incorporate a transverse torsion bar segment pivotably 
attached and interconnecting the vehicle chassis and 
suspension components. Stabiliser bars generally operate to 
increase the roll stiffness of the vehicle and improve the 
steering stability of the vehicle by resisting differential 
movement of laterally opposed wheels relative to the vehicle 
chassis. One example of a stabiliser bar is shown in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,648,620, which is assigned to the assignee of 
the present invention. Ford Motor Company Shop Manual for a 
1991 model Mustang automobile shows a stabiliser bar mounted 
at the front suspension at p.14-05-5, and a stabiliser bar 
mounted at the rear suspension at p.14-05-5. One of the drawbacks inherent in any suspension 
system is friction between moving suspension components 
connecting the wheel to the chassis. A particularly 
undesirable ride and noise characteristic can be related to 
the "static" friction of the suspension system. Static 
friction is best characterised by the amount of force 
necessary to initiate suspension movement on a stationary 
vehicle under curb load. Curb load defines the standard 
design payload for the vehicle, including a predetermined 
amount of fuel, passengers, and cargo. Stabiliser bars may contribute to the static friction 
component in the suspension. Engineers typically design 
stabiliser bars so there is no load on the stabiliser bar 
when the vehicle is stationery at curb load. This is 
referred to as the neutral position. If there is any load in 
the stabiliser bar under this condition, it is referred to  
 
as pre-load. Pre-load reacts throughout the suspension, 
possibly causing binding in the suspension joints or 
increasing the static friction and tilting the vehicle from 
side-to-side. Fig. 1 shows a motor vehicle 10 with a front 
suspension 12 utilising a stabiliser bar 14 attached in a 
conventional fashion. Brackets 16 support the central 
portion of the stabiliser bar 14 from the chassis 18 while 
fixed length links 20 connect the ends of the stabiliser bar 
14 to suspension members 22. However, the chassis 18, 
suspension members 22, and stabiliser bar 14 and the 
respective attachment points are built to specified design 
tolerances.

<CLAIMS>
A stabiliser bar and attachment apparatus 
comprising attachment means for attaching the stabiliser bar (14) to a motor vehicle 

chassis (18), said stabiliser bar (14) being interposed and connecting the chassis (18) 
and 

a suspension member (22) depending pivotally from the chassis 
(18), 

the stabiliser bar (14) including a torsional reaction segment (28) running 
generally transversely across the vehicle and left and right crank arms (34), each having a 

first end attached to the torsional segment (28) of the stabiliser bar (14) and a second end 
adapted for attachment to the vehicle, 

characterised in that 
said suspension attachment apparatus 

comprises 
slidable positioning 

means for self-adjusting the stabiliser bar (14) to a neutral load position at a predetermined 
vehicle load condition, said positioning means further adapted to be secured in said neutral 

position. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said positioning means comprises 
a first elongate member (40); a second elongate member (46); and adjustable interconnecting 

means (50) for connecting the first elongate member (40) with the second elongate member 
(46), said first and second elongate members (40, 46) being operative to slidably engage one 

another along an axis parallel to the elongate axes of said members (40,46), said slidable 
interconnecting means (50) being further operative to create a single rigid link upon fastening 

said first (40) and second (46) members together and to interconnect the stabiliser bar (14) to 
the vehicle to prevent a pre-loaded condition in the stabiliser bar (14). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said positioning means 
comprises: an elastomeric body (30) having an aperture adapted to receive the combination 

torsional reaction segment (28) therethrough; a bracket (84) for securing the stabiliser bar 
within the elastomeric body (30); and adjustable interconnecting means (86,88,90,92) for 

connecting the bracket (84) to the vehicle, said interconnecting means being configured to be 
adjustable in a plane generally parallel to the vertical axis of the vehicle, to prevent a 

pre-loaded condition in the stabiliser bar.  
 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein said interconnecting means (50) 
comprises a guide dowel (60) and a groove (62) adapted to engage said dowel (60). 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein said interconnecting means (50) 
comprises a threaded shank (56) fastener (58) and a threaded aperture (54) adapted to engage 

said threaded shank fastener (58) being operative to fasten said first and second members 
together. 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein said interconnecting means 
comprises a ferrule joint (68)(70)(72) adapted to fasten said first and second members 

together. 
An apparatus according to Claim 3 wherein said interconnecting means 
comprises a slidably adjustable platform (82) disposed between conventional bracket (84) 

and the chassis (18), said platform (82) having a substantially vertical leg (86) for attachment 
to the chassis (18) and a substantially horizontal leg (88) for attachment of the bracket 84, 

which supports the said torsional reaction segment (28) of the stabiliser bar (14), said vertical 
leg (86) having elongate apertures (90) having their elongate axes substantially parallel to 

each other and to the vertical plane of the vertical leg (86), and threaded shank fasteners (92) 
passing through each of the apertures (90) to securely attach the platform (82) to the chassis 

(18) but allowing vertical sliding motion of the platform (82) in relation to the chassis (18).
