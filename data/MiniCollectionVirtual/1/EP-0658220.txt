<DESCRIPTION>
Environmentally acceptable etching of metals.The art of etching metal plates in order to produce a reproducible image is centuries old. The
basic principle involves putting a resist coating on the surface of a clean smooth metal plate, removing a
portion of this resist with a suitable tool such as a needle and then immersing the metal plate for a
predetermined time in an acid bath in order to bite or remove a portion of the metal which is exposed
thereby. The resist is then dissolved off, usually by means of a solvent, and a printing ink rubbed into the
surface of the plate. The plate is then rubbed with a cloth to remove all or substantially all of the ink that
does not reside within the grooves caused by the etching process. The plate is then laid face up on a
suitable surface, covered with a suitably prepared, usually moist paper sheet and pressure applied thereto,
usually by means of roller press. This procedure causes the ink to be transferred from the grooves in the
metal plate on to the paper to give the printed image.These techniques have been used to create deep and wide cuts in the plate to provide an effect
on the paper known as embossing.In a well known variation of the acid etching process, known as aquatinting, the resist does not
totally and completely cover the metal plate. There are various methods for producing aquatint. The most
common of these is to deposit a thin dust film of rosin on the plate and heating the plate just enough to
make a major portion of the rosin adhere to the plate but not enough to produce a uniform coating. When
this plate is placed in an acid bath the acid will attack those portions of the metal to which the rosin does
not adhere. Other methods of aquatinting are well known to those skilled in the art of graphic printing.
The metals generally speaking, used to produce etchings are zinc or copper, brass and steel have also been
used, bronze and iron can also be employed but are not as favored.A further embodiment of aquatinting is known as sugar lift wherein a mixture of syrup, tempera
paint and soap flakes is painted onto a rosined plate, the painted plate placed first in water, to achieve the
lift, and then in acid to provide a very "soft" printable image. Whatever metal is used the general principle is the same. In order to achieve the etching or
removal of metal rather strong acid media are employed. These can be either nitric acid or a medium
generally known as "Dutch mordant" which comprises hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate as its main
constituents.

<CLAIMS>
A process of etching a roughened surface directly onto a metallic object,
the original surface whereof is partially covered by a resist surface and

causing the thus exposed portions of said metallic object to be subjected to
the action of an etchant force in an electrolytic bath containing an aqueous

electrolyte, an electrode and a source of direct current voltage having a
positive pole and a negative pole, comprising the steps of


a) immersing said metallic object to be etched in said bath proximate
to but spaced from said electrode,
b) connecting the negative pole of said direct current voltage source to
said electrode and the positive pole to said metal object whereby

said electrode becomes the cathode and said metal object becomes
the anode, and
c) applying direct current voltage,
characterized in that
the applied voltage is adjusted so that it shall be at least that of the
ionisation potential of the metal of the object in the electrolyte chosen and

shall not substantially exceed the sum of the decomposition voltage of the
aqueous electrolyte and the over-voltage of the cathode selected, whereby

hydrogen evolution is avoided,
said electrolyte is adjusted to a pH above 3 and below 7, and
said selected voltage is applied until the desired depth of metal has been
removed from the exposed portions of the anode and the desired degree of

roughness attained thereon.
The process of claim 1, characterized in that said electrolyte contains
initially cations of at least one of the metals constituting the anode.
The process of one of the preceeding claims, characterized in that said
voltage is applied between 0.3 and 2.5 volts.
The process of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the voltage of said
direct current voltage source is controlled.
The process of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the metallic object is a
plate.
The process of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the voltage is applied at
between 0.4 and 1 volt.
The process of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a stream of electrolyte
is directed initially substantially parallely between the cathode and the

surface of the metal object facing said cathode.
