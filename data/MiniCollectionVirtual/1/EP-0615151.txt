<ABSTRACT>
A backlit liquid crystal display device having 
improved nighttime operational characteristics includes a 

fluorescent lamp (300) for daytime operation and a separate 
light source (398) for nighttime operation which emits a low-intensity 

light. Preferably, the nighttime light source (398) 
is an electroluminescent panel which also acts as a 

daytime reflector of light. An integral image-splitting 
and collimating lens (302) is provided to increase the 

uniformity of the light emitted and to provide wide angle 
viewability. A sharp cut-off IR filter may also be 

included in the device to provide NVIS-B night vision 
goggle compatibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to backlit liquid crystal 
display devices (LCDs) having a first light source for 
operation during the day, and a separate and independent 
second light source for operation at night. LCDs are gaining in popularity for use in systems 
such as television receivers, computer monitors, avionic 
displays, aerospace displays, and other military-related 
displays, where the elimination of cathode ray tube 
technology is desirable for several reasons. In 
particular, cathode ray tubes are characterized by large 
depth dimensions, inordinately high weight and extreme 
fragility. Additionally, cathode ray tubes require a 
relatively high voltage power supply in order to 
sufficiently accelerate the electron beam, and thus 
sustain the displayed image. The aforementioned shortcomings of cathode ray tubes 
(CRTs) are overcome by the flat panel liquid crystal 
display in which a matrix array of liquid crystal picture 
elements or pixels are arranged in a plurality of rows 
and columns. Patterns of information are thereby defined 
by the two-dimensional array of pixels which, because of 
differences in the orientation of the liquid crystal  
 
material within each pixel, are caused to appear either 
darkened or transparent. Liquid crystal displays may be either transflective 
or transmissive. Transflective displays depend upon 
ambient light conditions in order to be viewed, i.e. 
light from the surrounding environment, incident upon the 
side of the display facing the viewer, is reflected back 
to the viewer. Transflective liquid crystal displays 
cannot, therefore, be used in a dark or low light 
environment, since there is no light available for 
reflection off the viewing surface of the display. Conversely, transmissive liquid crystal displays 
require the use of illuminating means, such as a tubular 
fluorescent lamp array operatively disposed on the side 
of the matrix array of pixels opposite the viewer. This 
illumination means, or backlight, may also include a back 
reflector adapted to efficiently redirect any stray 
illumination towards the matrix array of rows and columns 
of picture elements, thus ensuring that the displayed 
image is as bright as possible (given the characteristics 
of the lighting scheme employed). In the past, a great deal of research in the field 
of flat panel liquid crystal display devices has been 
dedicated to the design of backlighting schemes which 
optimize viewing and structural parameters of those 
displays. Particularly, uniformity and intensity of

picture elements, said matrix array having a viewing side 
and a rear side, and wherein said display further 

includes means for generating light to be passed through 
said matrix array which includes a first light source and 

a second light source, said first and second light 
sources being located rearward of said rear side of said 

matrix array thereby to create a pair of backlit light

apart light emitting members of substantially the same 
size so as to define a gap therebetween, said two spaced 

apart light emitting members each having an inner 
diameter defining an inner periphery and an outer 

diameter defining an outer periphery thereof, wherein 
said gap is defined as the distance between said inner 

peripheries of said two spaced apart light emitting 
members, said gap being of substantially the same width 

as each of said inner diameters of said spaced apart 
light emitting members;

projects into and through said gap between the inner 
peripheries of said two spaced apart light emitting 

members of said first light source;

such that when said first light source emits light the 

split, similar images thereof formed by said image-splitting 
means are cojoined to create a substantially

side of the matrix array, and such that when said second 

light source emits light, the split-images thereof formed 
by said image-splitting means are cojoined to create a 

substantially uniform generation of light for impingement
