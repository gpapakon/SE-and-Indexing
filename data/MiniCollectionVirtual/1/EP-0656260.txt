<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing roll
and a thin-film forming elastic plate which can be easily
fixed to a printing roll barrel by pressing an elastic
plate holder mounted on the thin-film forming elastic plate
against the printing roll barrel and which can be easily
pulled over the printing roll barrel without wrinkling the
thin-film forming elastic plate in fixing the thin-film
forming elastic plate to the printing roll barrel.Describing more specifically, as an apparatus for
forming a macromolecular thin-film pattern used for
electronic parts such as liquid crystal orientation films,
a thin-film forming apparatus shown in Fig. 29 comprising
the following components is known: an intaglio roll (A)
having a plurality of ink cells; an ink supply means (B)
having a doctor blade B2 for filling ink into the ink
cells; a printing roll (C) having a thin-film forming
elastic plate (E), installed on a barrel, to which the ink
of an intaglio roll (A) is transferred; a printing table
(D) for fixing thereto a to-be-printed material D2, to
which the ink of the printing roll (C) is transferred. The 
present invention relates to a printing roll preferably
used in such the thin-film forming apparatus and a thin-film
forming elastic plate to be installed on the printing
roll.A device, for fixing the thin-film forming
elastic plate to the printing roll, to be used in such the
thin-film forming apparatus is proposed by the present
applicant and disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No.
3-348683. In the device, the thin-film forming elastic
plate is installed on and removed from the surface of the
printing roll barrel comprising a hooking portion having
rotary type fixing screws and a pulling portion having
rotary type pulling screws, with elastic plate holders
having the printing roll-chucking holes for receiving the
rotary type screws installed on both ends of an elastic
portion of the thin-film forming elastic plate.That is, the thin-film forming elastic plate is
installed on the printing roll barrel as follows: The
fixing screws of the hooking portion of the printing roll
barrel are manually inserted into the printing roll-chucking
holes of one of the elastic plate holders
installed on the elastic portion; the fixing screws are
manually tightened to fix the elastic plate holder to the
printing roll barrel; the pulling screws of the pulling 
portion of the printing roll are manually inserted into the
printing roll-chucking holes of the other elastic plate
holder; and the pulling portion is moved by
