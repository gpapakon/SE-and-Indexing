<ABSTRACT>
In a vehicle having a voltage regulated 
electric alternator (14') driven by an engine (31) for 

supplying power to drive electrical loads (18') and to 
charge a vehicle battery (10'), a method of 

maintaining state of charge of the battery includes 
adaptively learning a system voltage set-point during 

a first mode of engine operation resulting in an 
electrical system operative in set-point regulation. 

The method determines from the learned system voltage 
set-point and a current system voltage during a second 

mode of engine operation that the electrical system is 
operating in an auto-regulation mode. Idle speed is 

controlled in response to the regulation state of the 
electrical system to maintain the system in set-point 

regulation so as to ensure adequate battery charge or 
minimal battery discharge during the second mode of 

engine operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
maintaining the state of charge of a vehicle battery
and to battery charge control apparatus.A typical motor vehicle electrical system
has a voltage regulated alternator connected to the
vehicle engine to provide power for vehicle electrical
loads such as lighting, instrumentation, climate
controls and other power accessories during operation
of the vehicle. Ideally, sufficient generated
electrical power remains available during all periods
of vehicle operation to maintain the state of charge
of the battery. However, it is well recognised that
there are periods of vehicle operation during which
the state of charge of the battery is actually reduced
due to net vehicle load power consumption exceeding
that generated by the alternator.These periods of operation, in which the
battery experiences a reduced state of charge, may be
short in duration, and caused by periods of
insufficient engine speed or of low engine speed, both
of which may result in a net electrical power draw
from the battery. Battery discharge is exacerbated
during such periods when the electrical load is
relatively high, such as is typically experienced
during inclement weather when accessories such as rear
defogger, heated windshield, heated seats, windshield
wipers, headlights and so on are used significantly.
It is also well known that cold temperature reduces
the charge acceptance rate of a battery, thereby
requiring even longer periods of high engine speed to
recharge the battery. Additionally, a battery which
is at least partially discharged and immediately
recharged has a much greater rate of charge acceptance 
than an equivalently discharged battery which is
allowed to sit for a period of 16 hours, roughly
equivalent to what is known in the automotive field as
"an overnight cold soak", representative of actual
expected periods of overnight inactivity.Automotive electrical loads continue to grow
as customer demand for more creature comfort options
such as heated seats, heated windshields and so on,
continues to rise. Expansion of electronic controls
on powertrain and suspension systems, evolution of
navigation, intelligent highway and obstacle detection
systems as well as numerous other accessories require
increased demands for electric power in an automobile.
Additionally, rising parasitic loads during periods in
which the vehicle is not used make maintaining a high
state of charge of the battery under all driving
conditions very desirable.It is well known that alternator output
increases with
