<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mass spectrometer having mass separation as a function of the time of flight with the aid of ejection electrodes, in which, when the ejection potential is switched off, all ions fly straight ahead and in which deflection electrodes are arranged in the flight path of the ion stream, which electrodes are loaded with deflection voltages which are variable with time so that the local resolution of each mass window results independently of the mass area to be resolved according to the equation  Mwindow x Udeflect = constant.

Mass spectrometer with transit time-dependent mass separation, comprising 
a channel plate in the form of a plurality of individual detectors disposed 

in the detector plane, as well as deflecting electrodes which deflecting 
voltages variable in terms of time are applied to, wherein when 

the deflecting potential is switched off all ions follow a straight flight 
path,
characterized in
 that deflecting voltages increasing and/or decreasing with 
a continuous time function are applied to said deflecting electrodes (3, 4), 

which voltages are adjustable with optionally selectable gradients between 
two variable limit values so that the ions are deflectable in correspondence 

with their mass-to-charge ratio to different flight paths and 
permit a determination of the mass on the basis of their locally different 

impingement on said channel plate (2). 
Mass spectrometer according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that said deflecting 
voltages at said electrodes (3, 4) are composed by a static and a 

dynamic fraction. 
Mass spectrometer according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
 that said deflecting 
voltages variable in terms of time satisfy the equation

Mass spectrometer according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
 that

characterized in
 that said potentials 
variable in terms of time and of different signs are applied to said 

deflecting electrodes (3, 4). 
Mass spectrometer according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
 that 
said dynamic fraction of said deflecting voltages is proportional to time.  

 
Mass spectrometer according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
 that

characterized 
in
 that an energy filter is provided in a direction orthogonal on the 
sense of the diverged ion beam.

in said flight path. 
Mass spectrometer according to Claim 11, 
characterized in
 that several 
units of fragmenting means (8) and separating electrodes (9, 10) are 

disposed in said flight path.
