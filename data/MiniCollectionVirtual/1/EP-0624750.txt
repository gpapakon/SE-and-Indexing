<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a device for connection and logic synthesis for a plurality of pairs of switching elements. Device, characterised in that it has two outputs (3, 3') for signals each positively indicating a general state of the whole in question, when the switching elements (2, 2') positively indicate the achievement of a first state, on the one hand, and negatively indicate the non-achievement of a second state, on the other hand, or vice-versa, for each of the parts or each of the elements which together contribute to the said general state of the whole, signals on the said outputs (3, 3') being valid only after the complementary states of the switching elements (2, 2') of each pair have been checked, and identical signals on the said outputs (3, 3') indicating an indeterminate general state of the complex whole.

Device (1) for the branching and logical combination of a 
plurality of pairs of switching elements (2', 2) with two 

states, the switching elements of each pair normally 
indicating in a complementary and opposing manner, one the 

production of a first state and the other the production of a 
second state distinct from the first state of a respective 

part or of a respective element of a complex assembly, which 
complex assembly can be located in a first or second general 

state of two distinct predetermined general states, 
characterised in that the device has two binary signal outputs 

(3', 3), the first general state of the complex assembly being 
indicated by a first output (3') of said outputs (3', 3) 

assuming a predetermined value and the second output (3) of 
the said outputs assuming the complementary state of the first 

output when, for each of the parts or each of the elements of 
the complex assembly, the switching element (2') contributing 

concomitantly to said first general state of the complex 
assembly positively indicates the production of the first 

state, on the one hand, and the switching element (2) 
contributing concomitantly to the second general state of the 

complex assembly negatively indicates the non-production of 
the second state, on the other hand, or, conversely, the 

second general state of the complex assembly being indicated 
by the second output (3) assuming said predetermined value and 

the first output (3') assuming the complementary state of the 
second output when, for each of the parts or each of the 

elements of the complex assembly, the switching element (2') 
contributing concomitantly to said first general state of the 

complex assembly negatively indicates the non-production of 
the first state, on the one hand, and the switching element 

(2) contributing concomitantly to the second general state of 
the complex assembly positively indicates the production of 

the second state, on the other hand, the signals from said 
outputs (3', 3) only being validated after verification of the 

complementary states of the switching elements (2', 2) of each 
pair and the signals from said outputs (3', 3) being identical  

 
when the complex assembly is in a general state other than 

said first and second general states. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
switching elements (2, 2') consist of proximity switches, 

preferably of the inductive, contact or passage type. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that it is arranged in a casing (8) of cuboid 

or cylindrical shape carrying, on one of its faces or on its 
cover, a plurality of connectors (9), for example with four or 

five pins (10, 10') advantageously arranged two by two while 
being aligned in two rows and intended for the branching of 

wires for joining the various pairs of complementary switching 
elements (2, 2') by means of connecting plugs with 

complementary pin configurations, an output connector (11) 
similar to the connectors (9) and mounted on one of the other 

faces or on the base of said casing (8) carrying the signal 
outputs (3, 3') of said device (1). 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
connectors of the switching elements have four or five pins 

(10, 10') allowing the branching of switching elements (2, 2') 
produced by two wire or three wire technology, one pin (10), 

the so-called output pin, being assigned to the signal output 
of the switching element (2, 2') under consideration of which 

the input is connected to the supply potential, and at least 
one pin (10') of said connectors (9) not being used for the 

link to the corresponding switching element (2, 2'). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that it comprises one or more circuits (12) 

for replacing and simulating the presence of a switching 
element (2 or 2') systematically indicating a state opposed or 

reversed with respect to that of the complementary switching 
element (2 or 2') associated with said switching element (2' 

or 2) replaced by said circuit (12) and with which it forms a 
pair.

simulation is arranged in a casing (14) with connectors of 
small size and in the form of a stopper which can be removably

joining the switching element (2 or 2') to be replaced.

(9) are linked to one another so as to form a continuous 
looped chain, the output pin (10) of each connector (9) being
