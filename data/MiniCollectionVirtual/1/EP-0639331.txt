<ABSTRACT>
An insecticidal and acaricidal smoke fumigant 
formulation is obtained by mixing granules A having a 

bulk specific gravity of 0.3 to 0.9 and containing a 
pyrethroid compound as an active ingredient, an 

inflammable substance and an organic blowing agent, with 
granules B having a bulk specific gravity of 0.5 to 1.1 

and containing potassium perchlorate, potassium nitrate 
and/or potassium chlorate, burning agent, heat 

generation-regulating agent, perchlorate-decomposing aid 
and inorganic filler, the mixing ratio (weight ratio) of 

the granules A and the granules being 1 to 0.5-4.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
insecticidal and acaricidal smoke fumigant formulation,
which is particularly useful for indoor uses.For many years, mosquito coils and electric
mosquito mats have widely been used to exterminate
mosquitos, but they are not effective against bedbugs,
house ticks (Ornithonyssusbacoti), cockroaches.For extermination of bedbugs, house ticks,
cockroaches, etc., jet-type smoke fumigant formulations
have been developed.In conventional jet-type smoke fumigant
formulations, an active ingredient -- which is mixed
with a smoking agent -- is jetted by the ignition of
the smoking agent. The conventional jet-type smoke
fumigant formulations do not exert sufficient insecticidal
effects of the active ingredient because a
considerable amount of the active ingredient contained
in the jet-type smoke fumigant formulations is
decomposed by the heat generated from the combustion of
the smoking agent, and because the combustion temperature
of the formulations is controlled to rather low
from the standpoint of safety, and, hence, so is the
vaporizing rate of the active ingredient.Accordingly, there has been a strong demand
for the development of smoke fumigant formulations, 
which can safely be burned to release the active
ingredient at a high vaporizing rate, thereby exerting
a potent insecticidal and acaricidal effects against
bedbugs, house ticks, cockroaches, etc.JP-A-04054102 discloses a flammable composition
containing potassium chlorate as an oxidant, an oxidant
decomposition stimulant and an organic flammable material.
The composition is for use in fumigating against harmful
organisms.JP-A-58140002 describes an insecticidal smoking
composition containing a pyrethroid insecticide,
azodicarbonamide as a smoking agent, dinitropentamethylene
tetramine as a foaming agent and nitrocellulose as a
heating agent.US-A-4228124 describes the thermal decomposition of a
mixture of an active ingredient, such as an insecticide,
and a blowing agent such as azodicarbonamide, in order to
vaporise and diffuse the active ingredient.In order to develop much more effective and
safe insecticidal and acaricidal smoke fumigant
formulations, the present inventors have extensively
studied, and, as a result, invented an insecticidal and
acaricidal smoke fumigant formulation, which comprises:
(A) 1 part by weight of granules A comprising 5 to 20
parts by weight of at least one pyrethroid compound as
an active ingredient;
10 to 20 parts by weight of at least one inflammable
substance selected from the group
