<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for supporting a glass sheet (14) during 
a tempering process is provided in which a truss ring 

structure (12) having a hot/cold ring (16) and a plurality 
of shaped fingers (18) having converging diagonal sides (19) 

extending from the hot/cold ring (16) supports the glass 
sheet (14). The apparatus further includes cushioning means 

which may include at least one layer of a composite mesh 
cloth (24), a fibreglass scrim (30), or both. In a 

preferred arrangement, the composite mesh cloth (24) is 
folded around the fibreglass scrim (30) and the shaped 

fingers (18) to provide optimum cushion and quench air flow 
to the glass.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
supporting a glass sheet during a tempering process, and 
more particularly, to an apparatus which supports and 
cushions the glass sheet during a tempering process without 
adversely affecting the optical qualities of the resulting 
tempered glass. Various apparatus and devices for supporting hot 
glass sheets during a tempering process are known in the 
art. One such device comprises a ring-type mould made of 
rigid metal that includes an outline upper surface shaped to 
conform to the shape desired slightly inward of the outline 
of the glass sheet. Typically, a glass sheet is heated in a 
furnace to its softening point, and then either pressed to 
shape between complementary moulds and transferred to the 
ring-type mould, or sagged by heat and gravity to the shape 
provided by the shaping surface of the mould. After the glass sheet is shaped, it is transferred 
while supported on the ring to a quenching station where it 
is quenched rapidly by applying cold air blasts against the 
upper and lower surfaces of the glass sheet. Such a 
tempering process greatly increases the mechanical strength 
of the glass and its resistance to breakage. Further, when 
fractured, tempered glass tends to break into relatively 
small, smooth pieces rather than large, jagged fragments. However, the ring-type mould that supports the glass 
sheet as it is transferred between the shaping station and 
the quenching station is alternately exposed to the hot 
temperature of the furnace and to the lower temperature 
provided by cold blasts of air at the quenching station. 
When a shaped glass sheet contacts the hot, heavy metal ring 
during this rapid cooling, glass breakage can result at the 
glass-metal contact areas due to the difference in heat 
conductivity between the glass sheet and the metal ring.  Further, when the heat-softened glass comes into 
direct contact with the rigid ring, slight blemishes or 
variations from the shape desired become obvious on the 
surface of the shaped glass. These blemishes disrupt the 
optical properties of the shaped glass. Accordingly, there have been attempts to eliminate 
these problems by avoiding direct contact of the glass sheet 
with the metal ring, thus preventing excessive heat transfer 
which may cause cracking. For example, McMaster, U.S. 
Patent No. 3,586,492, and Seymour, U.S. Patent No. 3,741,743 
disclose an endless ring frame for supporting a glass sheet 
having a plurality of teeth around the frame which are 
covered
