The present invention relates to a coil type high-voltage
or high-tension resistive cable for preventing noise which is
used, for example, as an ignition cable in an internal combustion
engine and is particularly designed to obtain a satisfactory

fibers such as aramid fibers, and a resistance wire 3
is wound around the outer circumferential surface of the rubber
layer 2 in a direction normal to the longitudinal axis of the
core 1, thereby forming a conductor 4. An insulator layer 5, a
net 6 made of glass fibers and a sheath 7 are formed around the
outer circumferential surface of the conductor 4, i.e., over the
