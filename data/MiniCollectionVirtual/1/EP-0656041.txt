<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to C14 to C20 alkoxy monophenyl sulfonium salt initiators having formula (I), wherein R is C14 to C20 alkyl; R1 and R2 are each independently C4 to C20 alkyl and X- is a non-basic, non-nucleophilic anion, which initiators are employed in the polymerization of mono- and poly- functional glycidyl ethers, alpha-olefin oxides and vinyl monomers or oligomers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DIA KYL ALKOXY PHENYL SULFONIUM SALT CATIONIC INITIATORSIn one aspect this invention relates to certain cationic initiators which have markedly improved solubility in hydrocarbons and ethers.In another aspect, the invention relates to a cationic polymerization initiator which is prepared by a simple process and to the use of these certain cationic initiators in the polymerization of alpha-olefins, epoxides and other monomers or oligomers containing long chain hydrocarbon groups.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPhotoinitiated cationic polymerization has received considerable attention in recent years as way to prepare 100% reactive coatings, inks, and adhesives. Accordingly, various cationic initiators have been developed, many of which are based on sulfonium and iodonium organic salts. However, most iodonium organic salts have been found to be unstable in the presence of highly reactive monomers. Of the sulfonium salts, those found to be useful include the triaryl sulfonium salts described in U.S. Patent No. 4,374,066, dialkyl phenacyl sulfonium salts described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,058,401 and dialkyl hydroxyaryl sulfonium salts described in U.S. Patent No. 4,230,814. Although useful for initiating the polymerization of a number of cationically polymerizable resins including epoxides, cyclic ethers and vinyl ethers, these highly polar, crystalline initiators are not readily soluble in non-polar solvents. Therefore, they are unsuitable for initiating the polymerization of long chain resins such as long chain alpha-olefin oxides and alkyl vinyl ethers. 

 Recently, the preparation and use of triphenyl alkoxy sulfonium salt photoinitiators has been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,882,201. Since it is now determined that hydrocarbon solubility improves with increasing length of an alkoxy chain group, these salts may be more suitable for initiating the cationic polymerizations of non-polar monomers and oligomers; however, increasing the alkyl chain length also increases crystallinity as indicated by a correspondingly increasing melting point. Hence, it is found that patentees' photoinitiators with long alkoxy chains must be heated to relatively high temperatures in order to effect their dissolution; thus, they are unsuitable for formulations involving volatile resins. A further drawback is that, since these initiators are only soluble in hydrocarbon resins at elevated temperatures, they tend to recrystallize out of solution at room temperature. The multicyclic alkaryl sulfonium salts of U.S. Patent 4,319,974 also
