<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reference potential generating
circuit, and more specifically to a reference potential generating circuit
utilizing a difference in threshold between MOS transistors having
different threshold voltages.Characteristics generally required in reference potential generating
circuits is that (1) a reference potential is ceaselessly at a constant
independently of a voltage supply voltage, and (2) the reference potential
is always at a constant regardless of temperature variation.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a band-gap reference type
reference potential generating circuit which can meet with the above
mentioned demands and which have been widely used. The shown circuit
is composed of bipolar transistors, and has an advantage in that a
generated reference potential has an extremely small variation
independently of a temperature variation and of a very large voltage
supply voltage ranging from several volts to several tens volts. However,
in the case that this reference potential generating circuit is incorporated 
into a CMOS semiconductor integrated circuit such as a memory, new
problems are encountered in that a process for manufacturing the bipolar
transistors must be newly added into the manufacturing process for the
CMOS integrated circuit, and several hundred microamperes are
additionally required for a consumed current of this reference potential
generating circuit.Under this circumstance, a reference potential generating circuit
composed of COMS transistors as shown in Figure 2 has been proposed
and actually used. The shown COMS reference potential generating
circuit was proposed by M. Horiguchi, et al in "1990 Symposium on VLSI
Circuits", pp75-76. This proposed reference potential generating circuit
is configured to generate a reference potential for a step-down voltage
supply which is used to internally step down an external voltage supply
voltage.In a threshold voltage difference generating circuit 10, a PMOS
(P-channel MOS) transistor Q1 is manufactured to include a channel
region having an impurity diffusion concentration which is different from
that of a PMOS transistor Q2, so that the PMOS transistor Q1 has a
threshold in absolute value larger than that of the PMOS transistor Q2.Each of PMOS transistors Q1 and Q2 have its gate and its drain
connected to each other, so that the threshold of each transistor appears
between a source and the drain. Therefore, a voltage, which is a
difference in threshold between the transistors Q1 and Q2, will appear on
a
