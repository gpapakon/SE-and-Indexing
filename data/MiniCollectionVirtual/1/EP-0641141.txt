<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for transmitting information between 
telecommunications devices. In particular, the invention allows users to send and 
display customized video images. Rapid technological advances in the communications industry have led 
to the introduction of new products and services which utilize digital information 
signals representing data, text and video in addition to voice information signals. 
The ability to transmit data or information signals as well as voice signals through 
one such telecommunications system, in particular through the telephone network, is 
typically accomplished via "in-band" signaling. In-band signaling is a transmission 
technique in which digital information or data signals are transmitted, in addition to 
voice signals, through the 3.3 kHz analog bandwidth of a traditional telephone. In-band signaling is typically performed in one of several ways. For 
example, Signaling System 7 is used in implementing a caller identification signal to 
the receiver of an incoming call between the first and second rings. Similarly, the 
Integrated Services Data Network (ISDN) allows data transmission at any point 
during a conversation on the D channel. Other methods for in-band use of voice and 
data signals include the ADSI standard TR-NWT-001273 which inserts data between 
voice and the "data under voice." In-band signaling has been employed in a number of 
telecommunications services. For example, caller identification schemes have 
become popular. See, Doughty, U.S. Patent No. 4,582,956, issued April 15, 1986; 
Doughty, U.S. Patent No. 4,551,581, issued November 5, 1985; Jones, et al. U.S. 
Patent No. 5,033,076, issued July 16, 1991; Lottes et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,567,323, 
issued January 28, 1986; Foster, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,591,665, issued May 27, 
1986; Hashimoto, U. S. Patent No. Re. 31,789 reissued January 1, 1985. Likewise, 
methods to provide more information to the calling party have also been developed. 
See, Demlow, et al., "Information Display Provided to a Calling Party," Serial No. 
07/953,437, filed September 29, 1992, and assigned to the assignee of this invention. However, the in-band transmission methods developed thus far are not 
"rich" in that they fail to more fully exploit the advantages of telecommunications 
systems. For example, the AT&T Videophone allows users to conduct in-band, 
private conversations and to send video information. Videophone operation is  
 
similar to conventional telephone operation. Person A initiates a
