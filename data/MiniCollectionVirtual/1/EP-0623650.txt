<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tire having a rubber 
tread which is reinforced with silica. In one aspect, 
the tread is comprised of a specified multiple component 
rubber blend reinforced with a quantitative amount of 
silica or a combination of silica and carbon black. Pneumatic rubber tires are conventionally prepared 
with a rubber tread which can be a blend of various 
rubbers which is typically reinforced with carbon black. In one aspect, rubbers are evaluated, selected and 
blended for a purpose of achieving desired tire tread 
properties and particularly a balance of tire tread 
characteristic properties, mainly, rolling resistance, 
traction and wear. For various applications utilizing rubber including 
applications such as tires and particularly tire treads, 
sulfur cured rubber is utilized which contains 
substantial amounts of reinforcing filler(s). Carbon 
black is commonly used for such purpose and normally 
provides or enhances good physical properties for the 
sulfur cured rubber. Particulate silica is also 
sometimes used for such purpose, particularly when the 
silica is used in conjunction with a coupling agent. In 
some cases, a combination of silica and carbon black is 
utilized for reinforcing fillers for various rubber 
products, including treads for tires. It is important to appreciate that, conventionally, 
carbon black is considered to be a more effective 
reinforcing filler for rubber tire treads than silica if 
the silica is used without a coupling agent. Indeed, at least as compared to carbon black, there 
tends to be a lack of, or at least an insufficient degree 
of, physical and/or chemical bonding between the silica  
 
particles and the rubber elastomers to enable the silica 
to become a reinforcing filler for the rubber for most 
purposes, including tire treads, if the silica is used 
without a coupler. While various treatments and 
procedures have been devised to overcome such 
deficiencies, compounds capable of reacting with both the 
silica surface and the rubber elastomer molecule, 
generally known to those skilled in such art as coupling 
agents, or couplers, are often used. Such coupling 
agents, for example, may be premixed, or pre-reacted, 
with the silica particles or added to the rubber mix 
during the rubber/silica processing, or mixing, stage. 
If the coupling agent and silica are added separately to 
the rubber mix during the rubber/silica mixing, or 
processing stage, it is considered that the coupling 
agent then combines in situ with the silica. In
