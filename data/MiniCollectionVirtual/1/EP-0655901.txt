<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a whirlpool bathtub with one or more intake devices for the intake, conveyance and feed of water out of or into the tub, in which the water can be taken in at one or more points on the tub via intake valves with intake apertures and supplied to the tub at several points via nozzles with outlet apertures and supplies to the tub at several points via nozzles with outlet apertures or via the intake valves with outlet apertures themselves. The likelihood of the device's sucking in a bather's hair is prevented in that, in the direction of flow of the water taken in there is, at a distance behind the intake valve(s) there is a protective filter with a plurality of apertures which are so small that hair cannot be sucked into the protective filter.

Whirlpool bathtub having one or more suction devices for sucking,
conveying and feeding water from or into the inside space of the

tub, the water being able to be sucked at one or more points of the
bathtub via a suction plate comprising suction openings and to be

fed again into the inside space of the tub at several points by means
of nozzles comprising outlet openings or via the suction plates

themselves comprising outlet openings, in the flowing direction of
the sucked in water behind the suction plate or plates (20) and at a

distance therefrom, there is arranged a protecting screen (10) in
each case which comprises a plurality of punctures (13) the aperture

widths of which are so small that a sucking in of hair into the
protecting screen (10) is prevented, characterised in that the punctures

are designed as bores with a maximum diameter of 1.5 mm.
Whirlpool bathtub as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
protecting screen (10) comprises in addition punctures formed as

slots (12) which have a maximum width of 1.5 mm.
Whirlpool bathtub as claimed in one of claims 1 or 2, characterised
in that in the marginal region of the back side of the protecting

screen (10), as seen in the flowing direction, staggered extensions
(11) are arranged on the circumference, said extensions (11) being

supported by a shoulder (51) in such a manner that slots are formed
between the extensions (11) the maximum widths of which amounts

to 1.5 mm.
Whirlpool bathtub as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in


that it comprises a ring (50),
that the suction plate (20) is supported on the ring (50) by means of
a rim (22),
that the ring (50) comprises a shoulder (51) on which the extensions
(11) of the protecting screen (10) are supported in such a

manner that the suction plate (20) is arranged at a distance from the
protecting screen (10), and 
that pressing means are provided which hold the protecting screen

(10) at the ring (50).
Whirlpool bathtub as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the pressing means are designed as a jet guide (30).
Whirlpool bathtub as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in


that four slots (12) are provided in the protecting screen, said slots
having the shape of quadrants in the circumferential direction, and

that the maximum width of the slots amounts to 1.5 mm .
Whirlpool bathtub as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the distance between the suction plate (20) and the

protecting screen (10) amounts to a maximum of 1.5 mm.
Whirlpool bathtub having several suction plates which are associated
with individual suction devices as claimed in any one of

claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that each suction device comprises a traveling
wheel (63) driven by electromotive force which is positioned directly

behind the protecting screen (10) in a pump housing, and

that the suction plate (20) and the protecting screen (10) are annular
metal sheets which are bulged so as to be tulip-shaped so that

they cover the traveling wheel (63) towards the inside space of the
bathtub in lying one behind the other.
Whirlpool bathtub as claim in claim 8, characterised in that the
protecting screen (10) comprises a geometrical shape different

from that of the suction plate (20) so that between the suction plate
(20) and the protecting screen (10) automatically a space is provided

which forms a zone of turbulences.
Whirlpool bathtub as claimed in claims 8 or 9 when referring to
claims 5 to 7, characterised in


that the suction plate (20) and the protecting screen (10) each comprise
a central recess forming the outlet opening,
that the suction plate (20) comprises a rim (23) on which the jet
guide (30) is supported by means of a flange (31), 
and that the jet guide (30) may be fastened to the suction plate by
means of a fastening ring (40).
