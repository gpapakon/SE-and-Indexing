<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic recovery 
device with which, when driving working members such as a 
boom, arm and bucket of a hydraulic excavator, for example, 
hydraulic force of a hydraulic fluid returned from a hydraulic 
actuator to a reservoir is reused to increase a 
speed of the working member, and more particularly to a 
hydraulic recovery device with which hydraulic force can be 
efficiently reused even upon, e.g., abrupt variations in 
pressure. One of prior art hydraulic recovery devices equipped 
in hydraulic drive systems is described in JP-B-4-57881, 
for example. This hydraulic recovery device is equipped in 
a hydraulic drive system comprising a plurality of actuators 
operated by a hydraulic fluid supplied from a variable 
displacement type hydraulic pump, and a plurality of directional 
control valves disposed between the hydraulic pump 
and the plurality of actuators for controlling respective 
flows of the hydraulic fluid supplied to the associated 
actuators. The hydraulic recovery device comprises varia-disposed  
 
in a first line communicating a reservoir port of 
at least one of the plurality of directional control valves 
and a reservoir, a third line communicating a portion of 
the first line upstream of the recovery control valve and a 
second line connected to a pump port of the directional 
control valve, and a check valve disposed in the third line 
for allowing the hydraulic fluid to flow only in a direction 
from the first line toward the second line. The recovery control valve comprises a spool formed 
with a variable throttle, a hydraulic driving sector to 
which the pressure in the second line is introduced as a 
condition variable related to the operation of a hydraulic 
cylinder for driving the spool in the valve opening direction, 
and a set spring for urging the spool in the valve 
closing direction. An opening area (an amount of restriction) 
of the variable throttle is set at the position where 
the pressure introduced to the hydraulic driving sector and 
the urging force of the set spring are balanced. When the directional control valve is operated in a 
direction to extend a rod of the hydraulic cylinder as the 
associated actuator, the hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic 
pump is introduced to a bottom side hydraulic chamber of 
the hydraulic cylinder via the first line and the directional 
control valve. On the other hand, the hydraulic 
fluid delivered from a rod side hydraulic chamber with the 
operation of the hydraulic cylinder flows into
