<ABSTRACT>
The reciprocating-piston internal combustion engine has a cylinder (1) in which a combustion chamber (4) is formed between a piston (2) and a cylinder head (3). At least two fuel valves (10, 12) are provided, each having at least one nozzle hole via which the fuel is injected cyclically into the combustion chamber (4). As seen in the direction of the cylinder axis (6), the fuel valves (10, 12) have a facing (A). Each fuel valve is assigned a disc-shaped zone of the combustion chamber (4), extending transversely to the cylinder axis (6), in which the fuel jet emerging from the nozzle hole spreads out.

Reciprocating internal combustion engine of the diesel type with at least one
cylinder containing piston (2), with a cylinder cover (3) covering the cylinder,

which together with the piston (2) defines a combustion chamber (4), and with
several fuel valves (20, 22) which each have at least one nozzle outlet via which

the fuel is injected periodically into a zone of the combustion chamber (4)
assigned to the particular fuel valve (20, 22), in which zone the jet of fuel

emerging from the nozzle outlet spreads out, wherein the fuel valves (20, 22),
looked at from the direction of the cylinder axis (6), are arranged in 
at least two
different axial positions, characterised in that the zones assigned to the fuel

valves (20, 22) comprise at least two disc-shaped zones each of which extend
transverse to the cylinder axis (6) and are adjacent to each other in the direction

of the cylinder axis (6), and that change-over devices (26) are provided which
are arranged in such a way that they transmit fuel, as desired, either to each fuel

valve (20, 22) in the different zones or only to each fuel valve (22) in one zone
or only to each fuel valve (20) in the other zone.
Internal combustion engine according to Claim 1, characterised in that fuel
valves (20; 22) which are assigned the same zone are peripherally displaced

from each other.
Internal combustion engine according to one of Claims 1 or 2 with at least two
fuel valves per zone and in which the air in the combustion chamber (4) exhibits

a twisting motion (B) around the cylinder axis (6), characterised in that the fuel
valves (20, 22) are arranged in all zones in such a way that at least some of the

jets of fuel emerge from the nozzle openings in the same direction as the
twisting motion (B).
Internal combustion engine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that it is designed as two-stroke engine.
Internal combustion engine according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that an outlet valve (5) for the exhaust gas is located in the centre of the cylinder

cover (3).
Internal combustion engine according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that all the fuel valves (20, 22) located in a given radial plane are connected to a

common fuel supply pipe (24). 
Internal combustion engine according to one of Claims 1-6, with two fuel valves
(20, 22) per fuel supply pipe, characterised in that the common fuel supply pipe

(24) has a fork in which is arranged a swivellable changeover device (26),
which, depending on the position, transmits fuel from the supply pipe to both

fuel valves (20, 22) or to one of the fuel valves (20) or to the other fuel valve
(22).
Internal combustion engine according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the ratio of the piston stroke to the internal diameter of the cylinder is at

least 3.5.
Internal combustion engine according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that the axial spacing (A) between the two different axial positions at which the

fuel valves (20, 22) are located is at least 2% of the piston stroke.
