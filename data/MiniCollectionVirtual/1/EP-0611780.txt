<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention
relates to an olefin polymer having a high melt tension and
capable of being molded by blow molding, vacuum molding or
the like.Olefin polymers such as polypropylene, high-density
polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and
the like are excellent in not only transparency but also
mechanical strength such as rigidity and impact strength,
and have been conventionally molded into films by means of
inflation molding, injection molding, extrusion molding,
etc.Such olefin polymers as mentioned above generally are
low in the melt tension (MT), so that they are difficultly
molded into large capacity containers (e.g., bottles) for
example by a blow molding or difficultly molded into liners
of electrical appliances for example by a vacuum molding. 
By those restrictions in the molding processes, the
resulting molded products are also restricted. That is,
the use applications of the olefin polymers are restricted
in spite that they have various excellent properties.Further, as for polypropylene, there are such problems
that a phenomenon of drawdown occurs and molding conditions
are restricted when propylene is molded into a film by an
inflation molding, because of its low melt tension. For
coping with those problems, a method of adding a high-pressure
low-density polyethylene or the like to
polypropylene is carried out in the conventional inflation
molding process to increase the melt tension thereby to
stabilize bubbles. However, this method sometimes induces
decrease of the film strength and decrease of a film.
transparency.Accordingly, if olefin polymers (e.g., polypropylene)
having a high melt tension are developed, it becomes
possible to form large capacity containers such as bottles
by a blow molding and to form liners of electrical
appliances by a vacuum molding from those polymers, and
hence the use applications of the olefin polymers can be
much more extended.Further, when the olefin polymers having a high melt
tension are molded into films by means of an inflation
molding, the bubbles can be stabilized and the molding
speed can be made higher. For these reasons, an advent of olefin polymers such
as polypropylene, high-density polyethylene and linear low-density
polyethylene having high melt tension has been
eagerly desired.US-A-5 021 382 discloses a transition metal-containing
solid prepolymerized catalyst component comprising the
