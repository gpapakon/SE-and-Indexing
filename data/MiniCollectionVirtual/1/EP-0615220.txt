<ABSTRACT>
A rotary display unit of the type having rotatably 
mounted, parallel vanes or louvres of triangular cross-section, 

is arranged to provide a back lit display 
without an internal light fitting within each vane (120). 

The vanes (120) are of transparent or translucent 
material. One end of each vane (120) is rotatably 

mounted by means of an axially apertured bearing (182). 
An external dichroic lamp (192) axially aligned with the 

bearing (182) directs light axially into the vane (120). 
The vane (120) is lined internally with a material (200) 

having a structured surface, as by axially extending 
microprisms (202), which provides a tunnel along which 

the light is subject to a combination of multiple 
reflections internally while a proportion of the light is 

emitted. A particular material disclosed is that 
manufactured by 3M under the name SOLF. The assembly of 

vanes may be rotated by a cam drive arrangement at the 
other end of the vanes remote from the lamps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary display unit of 
the kind having a plurality of parallel multi-sided vanes 
or louvres that are rotatable to provide a number of 
display surfaces. The vanes of such display units are usually of a 
triangular cross-section so that each vane or louvre has 
three display facets and the display unit provides three 
display surfaces. The vanes are intermittently driven, 
by 120° per step in the case of triangular cross-section 
vanes so that the three display surfaces are sequentially 
presented with a dwell period for each surface. An 
example of this kind of rotary display unit is disclosed 
in patent specification EP-A1-0 249 396, the disclosure 
of which is incorporated herein by reference. The vanes 
used in the unit described in that specification are 
hollow aluminium extrusions. They rely on external 
lighting for viewing. There has been a general development of back lit 
poster displays of various kinds and it is desirable to 
be able to offer a back lit display in a rotary display 
unit. Prior proposals have involved using transparent 
hollow vanes with a light source, such as a fluorescent 
tube, axially mounted in the vane and extending the 
length of the vane. Such arrangements pose considerable 
practical problems and are costly. Each vane must be 
provided with an internal lamp and the necessary support  
 
and electrical fittings while at the same time 
maintaining the necessary provision to rotatably mount 
the vanes. Fluorescent tubes are unsatisfactory in 
display units having smaller cross-section vanes because 
the external surface of the tube too closely approaches 
the surfaces of the vane in which it is mounted. This 
leads to non-uniform illumination of the surface and may 
give rise to undue local heating. There will be described hereinafter an embodiment of 
the present invention which is believed to offer 
advantages over the prior art by having each vane back 
lit by a light source that is external to the vane. Broadly stated the present invention provides a 
rotary display unit of the kind having a plurality of 
essentially parallel, multifaceted vanes and means for 
rotating said vanes to provide a plurality of display 
surfaces in succession, wherein
 
   at least one vane is of a light transmissive 
material,
 
   the vane has an interior hollow extending lengthwise 
along the vane,
 
   a layer of an optical lighting material having at 
least one structured surface is disposed in said hollow,
 
   means are provided at one end of the vane

<CLAIMS>
A rotary display unit of the kind having a plurality 
of essentially parallel, multifaceted vanes and means for 

rotating said vanes to provide a plurality of display 
surfaces in succession, wherein 

   at least one vane is of a light transmissive 
material, 

   the vane has an interior hollow extending lengthwise 
along the vane, 

   a layer of an optical lighting material having at 
least one structured surface is disposed in said hollow, 

   means are provided at one end of the vane to allow 
light to be introduced into the hollow interior, and 

   said layer of optical material has its structural 
surface arranged to provide a controlled emission of the 

introduced light along the length of the vane to back 
light the facets of the vane. 
A display apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 in which 
said optical film is formed to provide a hollow interior 

and said light introduction means comprises a light 
source directed into said hollow. 
A rotary display apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or 
2 in which said light introduction means comprises a lamp 

exterior to the vane and an opening at the end of vane 
leading to said interior hollow. 
A rotary display apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 2 
or 3 in which said vane has a triangular cross-section. 
A rotary display apparatus as claimed in any 
preceding claim in which the other end portion of vane 

comprises means for rotatably driving the vane. 
A rotary display apparatus as claimed in Claim 5 in 
which said means for rotatably driving the vane comprises 

cam surfaces engageable by a cam drive means mounted in 
the apparatus. 
A rotary display unit as claimed in any preceding 
claim in which said means at one end of the vane 

comprises an annular bearing member, and further 
comprising a source of light arranged to direct light 

into the opening provided by said annular bearing member. 
A rotary display unit as claimed in Claim 7 in which 
said opening in the bearing member is about the same size 

as the inscribed diameter of the internal cross-section 
of the vane. 
A rotary display unit as claimed in Claim 7 in which 
said bearing member rotates within and forms a plain 

bearing with an annular fixed bearing member.
