<ABSTRACT>
An auditorium has a domed roof formed by a first part spherical portion (8) covering, without intermediate support, most of an amphitheatre accommodating an audience, and a second part spherical portion (10) covering a stage adjacent the amphitheatre, the first portion being supported only at its periphery, and the second portion consisting of segmental leaves which can open about a common pivot (24) supported by the first portion to uncover the stage, the common pivot (24) being at a vertical axis of the second portion of the roof and above the amphitheatre and the vertical axis of the first portion (8) being above the stage. Wall panels behind the stage can be moved apart to open the rear or the stage to the exterior.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to auditoriums of the
amphitheatre type as used for concerts, theatrical,
cinematograph and other public presentations.A problem in the presentation of such performances
is that, where they are presented in different cities,
available facilities may vary greatly in physical layout
and capacity. This may require modification of the
performance or alter the artistic impression provided. The
available facilities may be ill suited to the size of the
expected audience, and usually do not combine facilities
for all-season usage with the potential for an outdoor
ambience.An object of the invention is to provide an
amphitheatre type auditorium providing standardized but
widely adaptable facilities, suitable for all-season, all
weather use, and capable of providing the ambience of an
outdoor performance.It has previously been proposed to provide
auditoriums of this type having roof portions in the form
of rotatable segmental leaves over a stage area, as shown
for example in British Published Patent Application No.
2225360A, particularly Figures 13 to 15 showing prior art 
structures. All such structures have required a central
pillar, which is highly undesirable if an audience is to
have an unobstructed view of the stage.In an article in Volume 147 of Schweizerische Bauzeitung,
81(1963.12.5),49, 873-876 "Le dome de l'auditorium de Pittsburgh",
there is described an auditorium in which the auditorium is formed
by a segmental dome having multiple segmentai leaves movable about
a centre pivot over an enclosed area. In this structure the
opening leaves which form the roof are supported at the vertical
axis of the roof by a cantilever structure extending over the roof
from outside its periphery, which structure is subject to very
heavy stresses. A spheroid containing such a supporting structure
must have a vertical axis coincident with that of the roof, and the
arrangement is only really suitable for an auditorium such as that
described in which the seating surrounds a stage area as opposed to
an auditorium in which an amphitheatre only partially surrounds a
stage. According to the invention, there is provided an
auditorium, comprising an amphitheatre having a seating
area only partially surrounding a stage, a first fixed roof
structure covering a majority of the amphitheatre area
except for a segmental area above the stage, and second
movable roof structure of segmental form movable between a
first position in which it closes said segmental area, and
a second position lapping the first roof
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An auditorium, comprising an amphitheatre having a
seating area only partially surrounding a stage, a first

fixed roof structure covering a majority of the
amphitheatre area except for a segmental area above the

stage, and second movable roof structure of segmental form
movable between a first position in which it closes said

segmental area, and a second position lapping the first
roof structure and leaving said segmental area open, said

movable roof structure comprising segmental leaves
rotatable in opposite directions about a common pivotal

axis 24 between a first closed position in which the leaves
abut and a second open position in which they underlay the

fixed room structure, the first and second roof structures
both being part-spherical shells, characterized in that the

fixed roof structure (8) is supported only at its
periphery, and the movable roof structure (10) is supported

at its periphery and by a connection to the fixed roof
structure on said common pivotal axis 24, in that a

vertical axis (7) of a first virtual sphere containing the
shell forming the fixed roof structure (8) passes through

the stage (6), and in that a vertical axis of a second
virtual sphere containing the shell forming the movable

roof structure (10) coincides with said common pivotal axis
(24) and is located horizontally spaced from the stage

above the seating area (2) of the amphitheatre,
intermediate between the axis (7) and the periphery of the

fixed roof structure.
An auditorium according to claim 1, characterized in
that a retractable curtain wall (12) is provided behind

that portion of the stage not surrounded by the seating
area.
