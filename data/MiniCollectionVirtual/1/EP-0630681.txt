<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for removing undesired impurities from a gas by heterogeneous catalysis. In order to achieve high efficiency and low energy consumption even at varying pollutant concentrations in a regenerable manner and without extension of the filter element, it is provided that the gas flows past an element which is constructed to be adsorptive and is furnished with catalyst material and the gaseous impurities are taken up, that heating then takes place to the process temperature required for oxidation and then catalytic combustion is performed to give environmentally tolerable gaseous reaction products. The heating is performed by a heating element integrated into the element and a gas is intermittently fed as oxygen carrier further after reaching the process temperature.

A method of removing undesirable impurities from a gas 
by heterogeneous catalysis, in which the gas is brought, at a 

temperature ranging from approximately room temperature to 
less than 200째C, by pressure or suction action to flow past a 

non-combustible solid element constructed as an adsorbent 
heatable to the process temperature and provided with finely 

distributed catalyst material, the gaseous impurities firstly 
being adsorptively attached and the element, at the latest 

after loading of the element with the theoretically maximum 
possible loading capacity, being heated to the process 

temperature necessary for oxidation of the impurities, the 
process temperature being maintained over a fixed time period 

and, when the process temperature has been reached, the 
impurities being catalytically burned at the attachment point 

to form environmentally compatible gaseous reaction products, 
renewed adsorptive attachment occurring after the heating has 

been switched off and cooling of the element to the operating 
temperature, characterised in that the gas is strongly 

deflected in the element constructed as a knitted fabric and 
the element, after maximum loading has been achieved, is 

heated directly by application of an electrical voltage to a 
heating element integral with the element to a process 

temperature of at least 200째C upon interruption of the supply 
of the gas to be cleaned and, after the process temperature 

has been reached, a gas is intermittently supplied as an 
oxygen carrier with a minimum content of 12 % by volume O
2
 
and the interval for the supply is such that the temperature 

on the feed side of the element does not drop below the 
process temperature and the temperature on the outlet side of 

the element does not exceed a fixed maximum value.

A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the concentration of the impurities and 

the amount of gas arising to be cleaned are measured 
continuously and set in relation to the loading capacity of 

the element and a control signal for switching on the heating 
is formed from this relationship taking into account a fixed 

safety margin. 
A method according to any one of preceding claims 1 to

resistance of the heatable element is used as a measuring 

signal for control of the heating. 
A method according to any one of preceding claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the maximum temperature on the 

outlet side of the element lies below 600째C. 
A method according to any one of preceding claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that, before the gas to be cleaned enters 

the element, the solid particles which may be contained in 
the gas as well as the liquid and fat droplets are separated 

off.
