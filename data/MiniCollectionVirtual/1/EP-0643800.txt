<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catalytic combustion engine exhaust gas purifier with additional air supply. The exhaust gas purifier comprises a housing structure (1) accommodating an exhaust gas inlet (2), at least one catalyst element (3), means (4) for laminarizing the exhaust gas flow, means (5 and 6) for dividing the housing structure (1) into several chambers (7-9), an exhaust gas outlet (10) and, additionally, means (11) for supplying additional air (17 and 18) into the exhaust gas flow (14 and 15) in the housing structure (1). One or more suction plates (19 and 20) are provided in the chamber (8) after the means (4) laminarizing the exhaust gas flow and at the same time in the vicinity of the means (11) supplying additional air. The suction plates (19 and 20) comprise exhaust gas ports and additional air (17 and 18) ports, and the suction plates (19 and 20) are arranged against the exhaust gas flow (14 and 15) and the additional air flow (17 and 18) so that the additional air is arranged to be sucked through the additional air ports and from the suction plates (19 and 20) into the exhaust gas flow (15) passing through the exhaust gas ports of the suction plates (19 and 20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a catalytic combustion 
engine exhaust gas purifier with additional air supply, 
comprising a housing structure accommodating an exhaust 
gas inlet, at least one catalyst element, means for 
laminarizing the exhaust gas flow, means for dividing 
the housing structure into several chambers, an exhaust 
gas outlet and, additionally, means for supplying additional 
air into the exhaust gas flow in the housing 
structure. An exhaust gas purifier according to the present 
invention is used in connection with combustion 
engines. The exhaust gas purifier of the invention is 
particularly suitable for small two-stroke engines, such 
as chain saws, lawn mowers, motor sledges, mopeds or 
motor cycles, in which there is only a very small and 
limited space for an exhaust gas purifier. Catalytic exhaust gas purification is based on 
the purification of the exhaust gas by feeding it 
through one or more catalyst elements. The catalyst 
elements contain a catalytic agent which accelerates 
the combustion of harmful impurities, i.e. in practice 
it makes combustion possible at a temperature lower than 
normal. Today purification of exhaust gases is important 
especially for preventing environmental pollution. Conventional 
catalytic purifiers have problems with sufficiency 
of oxygen, because, if there is not enough oxygen, 
carbon monoxide produced as a combustion product 
of hydrocarbon is not further oxidized into carbon dioxide 
owing to the lack of oxygen. As carbon monoxide 
has no smell and is colourless, it is hazardous to its 
environment and especially to people. In order to improve 
the efficiency of catalytic purification it is  
 
previously known to use exhaust gas purifiers into which 
additional air is supplied from the outside, and thus 
the oxygen contained in the additional air accelerates 
the combustion reactions by means of which a faster and 
more complete combustion of the principal pollutant 
components of exhaust gas, i.e. carbon monoxide (CO) and 
hydrocarbons (HC), is achieved. Catalytic exhaust gas 
purifiers provided with additional air supply are called 
oxidizing purifiers. GB Patent 2 048 706 discloses a catalytic purifier 
provided with additional air supply. In this construction 
additional air supply has been improved so 
that the tube supplying additional air extends inside 
the purifier from one edge of the purifier to the other, 
said tube comprising several holes for mixing the additional 
air with the exhaust gas. This construction does 
not, however,
