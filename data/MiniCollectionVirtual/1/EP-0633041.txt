<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical appliance for the
treatment of a portion of blood vessel by means of
ionizing radiation, comprising a catheter for
percutaneous transluminal treatment of the blood vessel,
an inflatable dilatation balloon surrounding a portion
of the catheter, a radioactive radiation emitter
fitting in said portion of the catheter and being
radially centered inside the balloon, and means for
advancing, resp. removing, the radioactive radiation
emitter into, resp. from, the portion of the blood vessel.Atherosclerosis causes thickening and hardening of
arteries and formation of deposits of plaque or plaque-ridden
tissue within the arterial lumen. Such a disease
is commonly treated by means of percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty techniques involving, i.a., the non-surgical
widening of a passage through an artery by means of
a balloon inflated to dilate the area of obstruction
or the abrasion of the deposits by means of atherectomy.
Unfortunately, the major limitation of these angioplasty
or atherectomy techniques is the relatively important
rate of restenosis. As it has been shown, the balloon
angioplasty produces intimal and medial injury leading
to excessive platelet aggregation and cell mediators
activation followed by an elevated production of myocital
growth factors. The cascade of these events, regulated
by arterial wall cells nuclei, results in hyperproliferation
of smooth muscle cells and migration of myocites
and macrophages from the media layer towards the intima
and further accelerates excessive neo-intimal formation
leading to lumen narrowing. Many approaches to prevent 
this phenomenon have been tested, among which regimes
of anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, vasodilators,
and serum cholesterol level reducers, however, without
appreciable therapeutic effect. As a further approach
to this problem, it has been found that ionizing radiation
could prove helpful in the treatment of unwanted
cell proliferation which causes recurrent stenoses
or occlusions after angioplasty.The document International Journal of Radiation Oncology
Biology Physics, Vol. 24 Suppl. 1, page 171, which
reports Proceedings of the 34th Annual ASTRO Meeting
of November 1992, refers to a study on the prophylaxis
of intimal hyperplasia after stent implantation in
peripheral arteries using endovascular irradiation.
This study was directed to the frequency of recurrent
stenoses or occlusions following stent implantation
in peripheral arteries due to rapid intimal hyperplasia.
To stop the proliferation of
