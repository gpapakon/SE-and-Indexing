<ABSTRACT>
This distributor includes a reservoir (2) of powdered material, the bottom of which opens out into a chamber (7) opening over a tube (12) which, over its entire length, encloses a helical conveyor member (16) connected to means (17) for driving in rotation and capable, by turning, of entraining the powdered material flowing from the reservoir towards a discharge orifice (14) made downstream in the tube. According to the invention, at least one rotary mixing member (19) is provided in the bottom of the reservoir (2) by being coupled mechanically to the helical conveyor member (16) by means of a rotary coupling device (20) adapted so as to be driven in rotation directly by the said helical conveyor member (16). The invention applies particularly to automatic distributors of ground coffee for automatic coffee-making machines.
