<ABSTRACT>
A graphical method is devised whereby the local relationships called hereafter 
"correlations" in a data set are represented in two, three or n dimensional space. The two 

dimensional first order diagrams correlate three successive events. The difference between 
the second and the first event is the x coordinate and the difference between the third and 

the second is the y cartesian coordinate. The two dimensional second order diagrams are 
obtained by considering four events. The y coordinate is the sum of the fourth and the 

second minus two times the third event whereas the x coordinates is the sum of the third 
and the first minus two times the second event. The diagrams could be generalized to n 

order and m spatial dimensions in any system of coordinate thus extending the local domain 
under consideration. If local correlations exist in the data set, the diagrams of all orders show 

well defined structures. Each part of a structure can be related to well defined events 
characterizing the processes under investigation. This invention is particularly important in 

cardiology. It detects in a single glance, quantitatively and qualitatively, the arrhythmias and 
the fluctuations of cardiac activity thus in general probes cardiac dynamics. This invention is 

a powerful tool for detection of existing pathological activity, monitoring the effect of drugs, 
assessing the change in cardiac dynamics, due to aging and detecting the onset of states 

leading to heart failure before the catastrophic event. The conceptual simplicity of the 
method, which could be implemented on a personal computer makes this invention a 

valuable tool for cardiologists and also for the general practitioners. The invention could be 
applied to any situation where correlations are present in a long succession of sequential 

events or measured quantities, such as for example in electrophysiology.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to sequence analysis and, more particularly, is 
designed to assess local relationships, hereafter conveniently called "correlations", in an 
ordered sequence of events and in a geometrical representation. The geometrical 
representations of local correlations are of common use for assessing the presence of 
chaotic dynamics in physical, chemical and biological systems as well as cardiac activity. 
Reference is hereby made for examples to J. Guckenheimer and P. Holmes (in Nonlinear 
oscillations, dynamical systems and bifurcations of vector fields. Springer-Verlag) So called " return maps " display, in a two dimensional system, an element of the 
sequence as a function of the preceding element. A well defined structure in this display 
indicates the existence of local correlations. However in most systems of practical 
importance these short range correlations do not furnish structured, i.e. exploitable 
patterns. The elaboration of a method for assessing local correlations over several 
consecutive events may furnish valuable information about the underlying mechanism which 
generates the correlations. A geometrical display of such correlations may become a 
powerful tool in such fields as cardiology and neurophysiology. An attempt has been made by Woo , Stevenson , Moser, Trelease and Harper 
(Patterns of beat-to-beat heart rate variability in advanced heart failure. American Heart 
Journal Vol 123 No 3 704-710 March 1992) to parallel by visual inspection, the shape of 
return maps with cardiac pathologies. Such an endeavour does not furnish any qualitative or 
quantitative conclusions about the underlying pathologies. With the present invention we 
extend the assessment of local correlations between elements of a data set to three, four , 
five or n consecutive elements. Whenever such correlations exist, geometrical 
representations in two, three and m dimensions show well defined structures. The latter 
could be given precise meaning and quantitative assessment with regard to the underlying 
process that generated the data set. The field of cardiology is one of the most suitable domains of application of our 
invention. The automatic assessment over periods up to 24 hour of cardiac activity can be 
performed and the result displayed in a simple graph. Arrhythmias of all nature appear as 
well defined structures that in some cases can be cast into mathematical equations. The analysis of the graph does not require advanced mathematical knowledge. A
