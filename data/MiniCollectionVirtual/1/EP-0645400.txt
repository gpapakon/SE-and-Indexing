<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ethylene polymer
and a fuel tank using the same. More particularly, it
relates to an ethylene polymer which exhibits high melt
tension and excellent molding properties such as uniform
stretchability in blow molding, especially for production of
large-sized articles, to provide molded articles having
excellent mechanical characteristics, such as high stiffness
and high impact resistance, and excellent fire resistance.
It also relates to a fuel tank having excellent impact
resistance and fire resistance even with a smaller thickness
than was used conventionally.In the field of automobile industry, replacement of
metallic materials with plastics in various automobile parts
has been promoted recently for the purpose of weight
reduction and energy saving. Polyolefin resins are generally
used for this purpose from the standpoint of cost,
environmental conservation as well as product performance
such as strength, weather resistance and chemical resistance.Of polyolefin resins, polyethylene is particularly
suited to blow molding. Polyethylene having a relatively
broad molecular weight distribution, high melt tension, and
uniform stretchability is generally employed. In particular, 
large-sized blown polyethylene containers, such as fuel tanks
or drums, have been attracting attention.Fuel tanks made of high-molecular-weight and high-density
polyethylene have large freedom of shape as compared
with conventional steel-made fuel tanks and are mounted on
such types of automobiles as 4-wheel-drive cars or 4-wheel-steering
cars.Ethylene polymers suitable for such use proposed to
date include ethylene copolymers with excellent molding
properties and environmental stress cracking resistance
(hereinafter abbreviated as ESCR) as disclosed in
JP-A-2-53811(1990). EP-B-0 273 284 
relates to a polyethylene
composition which is formed by blending polyethylene obtained according to a two-step polymerization
process using a Ziegler catalyst with high-molecular-weight polyethylene,
which has excellent environmental stress cracking resistance
and gives molded articles with good surface properties, and which is suitable for use
in blow molding and extrusion molding.However, when high-density polyethylene is molded
into fuel tanks of complicated shape, the wall of the
resulting tank becomes thinner and weaker at bends so that
the wall thickness of the whole tank must be increased, which
leads to disadvantages for economy and weight reduction.Where ethylene is copolymerized with an α-olefin
