<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydro-store with a storage casing (10) in which two partial chambers for media to be separated from each other are formed by a separating diaphragm. Because there is at least one other separating diaphragm (22, 24) in the storage casing (10) arranged in such a way that the number of partial chambers (30, 32, 34) formed is at least one greater than that of the separating diaphragms (22, 24) and/or these partial chambers (30, 32, 34) are formed by at least one storage bubble which is sealed to the storage casing (10) along its outer periphery, the hydro-store has a wider field of application than prior-art types. It is in particular possible with the multi-chamber hydro-store of the invention to store energy more favourably for the same size than in a conventional store with only one separating diaphragm.

WC-flush system for reducing the freshwater requirement 
in toilets (40), with a freshwater supply (44) able to be shut 

off by means of a valve arrangement (48; 52, 54; 66, 70), which 
freshwater supply (44) is connected to a hydraulic accumulator, 

which can be filled with freshwater, which can be delivered to 
the toilet (40) by way of a supply line (42) able to be shut off 

by means of the valve arrangement (48; 52, 54; 66, 70) and which 
comprises an accumulator housing (10), in which by means of a 

separating diaphragm (24) two partial chambers (30, 34) are 
formed for receiving gas and freshwater to be separated from each 

other, characterised in that a further separating diaphragm (22) 
is located in the accumulator housing (10), which defines a 

further partial chamber (32) for receiving at least one medium, 
that the partial chamber (30) enclosed by the two separating 

diaphragms (22, 24) serves to receive gas and that in one 
switching position of the valve arrangement (48; 52, 54; 66, 70), 

a partial chamber (34) may be filled with freshwater, which can 
be delivered to the toilet (40) in another switching position, 

in which the further partial chamber (32) simultaneously receives 
the respective medium. 
WC-flush system according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the medium able to be received respectively in the other 

partial chamber (32) is freshwater from the freshwater supply 
(44), compressed air from a compressed air device (60) or fluid, 

in particular hydraulic oil, conveyed by a fluid pump (64). 
WC-flush system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the respective separating diaphragm (22, 24) is 

constructed in the manner of a shell and is connected in a 
sealing manner by its longitudinal edge (26) peripherally to the 

accumulator housing (10). 
WC-flush system according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that fluid-carrying lines (74) open at one end  

 
of the accumulator housing (10) into the fluid-carrying partial 

chambers (32, 34), which at the other end of the accumulator 
housing (10) are connected by way of respectively one vent line 

(76) once again to their fluid-carrying lines (74). 
WC-flush system according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that provided between the respective separating 

diaphragms (22, 24) and the accumulator housing (10) is a rigid 
boundary wall (90) or separating layer with passages.
