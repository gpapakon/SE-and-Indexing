<ABSTRACT>
The data-transmission line (DS) has a digital test-sequence (a) fed into it at the input end. An output sequence received is correlated, by means of a cyclically bitwise shifted exclusive-OR function (EXOR) followed by check-sum formation to form a dual cross-correlation (KKFd), with a reference sequence (R) corresponding to the test sequence. The number of defective bits (BF) is immediately apparent from the low-order positions of the extreme value (EX) of the cross-correlation function (KKFd).

Method for ascertaining the number of items of 
digital data which are transmitted erroneously by way 

of a data transmission link which is to be examined 
(number of bit errors BF), wherein a test sequence (A) 

consisting of digital data (bits) is transmitted on the 
link-input side, wherein an output sequence (AS), which 

is received thereupon on the link-output side, is 
cross-correlated with a reference sequence (R; 
R
), 
which corresponds to the test sequence (A) or the 

inverted test sequence (
A
), and wherein by means of 
evaluation of the extreme value (EX) of the cross-correlation 

function (KKF) thus formed the number of 
bit errors (BF) is determined, characterised in that 

the output sequence (AS) is cross-correlated with the 
reference sequence (R) by means of a respective 

exclusive-OR operation (EXOR) with subsequent cross-summation 
whilst forming a dual cross-correlation 

function (KKF
d
(n)) in accordance with the standard 
specification: 


 
where
 
O ≤ n ≤ N-1 


with: 
 :
exclusive-OR operation 
f(m):
reference sequence R; 
R
h(n+m):
output sequence AS 
N:
number of the bits in the test sequence A 
n:
number of the bit positions by which the 
output sequence is shifted relative to the 

original output sequence, 
 
and in that the number of bit errors (BF) is indicated  

 
immediately by means of indication of the low-order 

positions of the extreme value (EX) of the dual cross-correlation 
function (KKF). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the exclusive-OR operation (EXOR) is executed 

inversely as an exclusive-NOR operation (EXNOR) when 
the dual cross-correlation function (KKF
d
) is formed 
and in that when the test sequence (A) is used as the 

reference sequence (R), the low-order positions of the 
inverted extreme value (EX) are used to indicate the 

number of bit errors, whilst when the inverted test 
sequence (
A
) is used as the reference sequence (
R
) the 
low-order positions of the extreme value (EX) are used 

to indicate the number of bit errors (BF) directly. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a 2
n
-m-sequence, a Barker-code, a 
Gordon-Mills-Welch (GMW)-sequence or a Gold-Code is 

used as the test sequence. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that on the link-input side 

besides the test sequence (A) there is additionally 
transmitted an inverse test sequence (
A
) which is 
formed by inversion of the test sequence (A), and in 

that in addition the relative type (maximum; minimum) 
of the extreme value (EX) of the dual cross-correlation 

function (KKF
d
) is also evaluated. 
Arrangement for carrying out the method 
according to one of the claims 1 to 4, having a 

transmitter (SE) to output a test sequence (A) of 
digital data or an inverse test sequence (
A
), which is 
formed by inversion of the digital data, to a data 

transmission link (DS) which is to be examined, having 
a receiver (EM) for reception of an output sequence 

(AS) on the link-output side and having a correlator 
(K) to which on the input side the output sequence (AS) 

and a reference sequence (R) are applied in order to  
 

form a cross-correlation function (KKF), characterised 
in that the correlator (K) contains an exclusive-OR 

logic circuit (EXOR) or an exclusive-NOR logic circuit 
(EXNOR), downstream of which an adder is arranged for 

cross-summation, in that a comparator compares the 
cross-sum (Q) with an upper threshold value (OS) and a 

lower threshold value (US), in which case the threshold 
values (OS, US) are set at given intervals with respect 

to value-range limits which are typical of the test 
sequence, and in that a selection circuit arrangement 

(S), as a function of an instance in which it is 
established that a threshold value has been exceeded, 

supplies at least the low-order positions of the 
supplied cross-sum (Q) to a further-processing device 

or to a display (AZ).
