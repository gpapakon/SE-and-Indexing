<ABSTRACT>
Push-down (depressible) valve for dispensing in vaporised (atomised) form a liquid contained in a flexible pouch (2) itself located inside a container under the pressure of a gas, including a valve body (9) designed to be fixed into a dished part with the interposition of a sealing washer (13) between an open frontal end of the valve body and the dished part, an operating shank (14) able to slide between a position of rest and an open position, the valve body forming a chamber (C) which is isolated from the outside when the shank is at rest, the shank being kept in this position by an elastic return means, an additional gas intake orifice (31) provided in the lateral wall of the valve body, valve means (p, 28) able to place the flexible pouch in communication with the chamber (C) when the shank (14) is pushed in, and to isolate the said pouch (2) from the said chamber (C) when the valve is in the state of rest, these valve means being controlled by the displacement of the shank, and being able to establish the said communication between the pouch (2) and the chamber (C) only after the operating shank (14) has covered a given distance (D).

Pushbutton valve for dispensing, in the form of 
a spray, a liquid contained in a flexible pocket (502) 

itself located inside a container under pressure from a 
gas, this valve being arranged so that it operates 

regardless of the position of the container, and including 

a valve body (509) intended to be fixed into a dished 
part with the interposition of a sealing washer (513) 

between an open front end of the valve body and the 
dished part, a control stem (514) able to slide in the 

valve body between a position of rest and an open position, 
the valve body forming a chamber (C) which is 

isolated from the outside when the stem is at rest and 
interacts with the sealing washer so as to close the said 

chamber, the stem being held in this position of rest by 
elastic return means (520), an additional gas inlet 

orifice (531) being provided in the lateral wall of the 
valve body, the body being equipped, at its lower part, 

with a means (523) for fastening the flexible pocket 
containing the liquid, valve means (p, 528) being able to 

place the flexible pocket in communication with the 
chamber (C) when the stem (514) is pushed in, and to 

isolate the said pocket (502) from the said chamber (C) 
when the valve is in the state of rest, these valve means 

being controlled by the movement of the stem, and being 
able to establish the said communication between the 

pocket (502) and the chamber (C) only after the control 
stem (514) has travelled a given distance, so that before 

and after a dose of a liquid/gas mixture is dispensed, 
the chamber (C) is purged each time by a blast of gas 

alone, the valve stem (514) projecting through an opening 
in the dished part and being capable of sliding in a 

sealed fashion in the sealing washer (513), this stem 
including a blind bore (518) opening at its end remote 

from the valve body, whereas a transverse orifice (519) 
is provided in the wall of the stem to emerge in the 

blind bore and, to the outside, in the region of the 
sealing washer (513) when the stem is in the position of 

rest, the said transverse orifice (519) then being closed  
 

by this sealing washer (513) and the end of the stem 
situated in the valve body (509) being equipped with an 

extension (528) capable of interacting with a passage (p) 
between the chamber (C) of the valve body and the flexible 

pocket (502) so that in the position of rest of the 
valve stem, the passage (p) is closed by the extension, 

whereas when the valve stem is pushed in, a communication 
is set up between the chamber (C) of the valve body and 

the flexible pocket (502), characterized in that the 
passage (p) for communication between the chamber (C) of 

the valve body and the flexible pocket (502) is provided 
in the valve body (509), whereas the extension (528) of 

the valve stem includes an intermediate zone (528
a
) with 
a diameter which is smaller than that of the passage (p) 

and a cylindrical end zone (528
b
) with a sufficient 
diameter to close the passage (p), the unit being such 

that when the valve stem is pushed in, the intermediate 
zone (528
a
) finds itself in the region of the passage (p) 
and establishes a communication between the flexible 

pocket (502) and the chamber (C) of the valve, whereas 
when the valve stem (514) is in the position of rest, the 

end zone (528
b
) finds itself in the region of the passage 
(p) and cuts any communication. 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the extension (528) consists of a coaxial cylindrical 

element fixed to the end of the valve stem (514), and of 
which the end pointing towards the flexible pocket (502) 

is equipped with an overmoulding (38) made of an elastomeric 
material constituting the abovementioned end zone 

(528
b
). 
Valve according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
it includes a sleeve (39) forcibly engaged in the bore of 

the means (523) for fastening the pocket (502) and coming 
into abutment against the shoulder marking the bottom of 

this bore and serving to guide the extension (528) in 
terms of sliding, the sleeve (39) including an annular 

cavity (40) into which there emerges a cylindrical 
passageway (41) which is radially offset relative to the 

axis of the sleeve and which causes the cavity (40) to  
 

communicate with the flexible pocket (502). 
Valve according to either of Claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in that the chamber (C) is equipped at its 

lower part with radial ribs against which the lower end 
of the return means (520) bears. 
Container containing a flexible pocket (502) in 
which there is a liquid to be sprayed, the pocket being 

kept under pressure by the gas contained in the container, 
characterized in that it includes a dispensing 

valve according to one of Claims 1 to 4. 
Container according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the bottom of the container has a hole equipped with 

a valve allowing the container to be filled and refilled 
with pressurized gas.
