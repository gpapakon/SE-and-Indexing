<ABSTRACT>
The glazing seal (7), which can be used on windows, doors or façades, exhibits an outer sealing lip (8), whose projection surface onto the glass pane (10) is small. Its press-on force onto the glass pane is influenced essentially by the abutment web (2). The fastening foot (6) of the glazing seal is anchored in an undercut groove (3) of the abutment web (2). The sealing lip (8), provided on the outer side of the abutment web (2), exhibits a base surface (11) which can be supported on the outer border moulding (5) of the groove (3) and runs parallel to the glass pane (10). The base surface is delimited towards the outside by a sealing lug (16) which has a low thickness and is intended for covering the gap between the base surface and the border moulding of the abutment web (2). The sealing lug (16) is supported on a floor-like surface of a pane-side border edge of the abutment web. There is a uniform, neat transition from the outer surface of the sealing lip (8) to the bordering delimiting surface of the abutment web (2), depositing of dirt particles being avoided by the step-free transition.

Shaped frame member of a window, a door or a facade, and glazing sealing arrangement having a main body provided at the pane side with sealing lips (8, 9), and an associated fitting limb (2) of said shaped frame member (1) which fitting limb (2) has a groove (3) which is of an undercut configuration and which is delimited by edge bar portions (4, 5) and in which a securing base (6) of the glazing sealing arrangement (7) can be anchored, 
characterised in that
 the outer sealing lip (8) which projects beyond the other sealing lips (9) is arranged in the region of the outer edge bar portion (5), the other sealing lips (9) lie beneath the edge bar portion (5) and the sealing lip (8) is composed of a compact sealing lip root (13) and a tip (15) which deforms when bearing against the pane, the sealing lip root (13) has as its support area at the edge bar portion (5) has a base surface (11) which is supported against the outer edge bar portion (5) and which extends parallel to the pane of glass, the base surface (11) is delimited outwardly by a sealing nose (16) for covering the gap between the base surface and the edge bar portion (5) of the fitting limb, the upper edge, which is towards the pane, of the fitting limb (2) is provided with a rounded configuration of the radius R, and the sealing nose (16) is supported against the rounded configuration and is of a length in the range of R to 1.5 R and a thickness X which corresponds to the radius R.
Shaped frame member and a glazing sealing arrangement according to claim 1 
characterised in that
 the sealing nose (16) applies to the associated arcuate surface of the edge bar portion (5) a contact pressure which is given by dimensional overlap.
Shaped frame member and a glazing sealing arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that
 the transition from the outside surface of the sealing lip (8) to the adjoining boundary surface of the fitting limb (2) is stepless.
