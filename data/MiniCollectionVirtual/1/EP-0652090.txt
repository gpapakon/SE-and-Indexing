<ABSTRACT>
Processed coconut outer husk chops, including 
coconut outer husk chops produced by compressing coconut 

outer husk at substantially right angle to the directions of 
coirs and chopping the compressed coconut outer husk. A 

reference sample of a resulting coconut outer husk chop 
which was left at 20 °C at 50 % relative humidity for three 

days contains 0.01-2 wt% tannin and 0.15-0.6 wt% Fe₂O₃. 
Each processed coconut outer husk chop is 
sufficiently porous, and has a shape holding power, a good 

drainage, a low tannincontent and a high iron content. A 
process for producing processed coconut outer husk chops is 

disclosed. 
The processed coconut outer husk chops are suited 
to a plantingmaterial, an inert medium for hydroponics and 

a microorganism propagating bed for propagating a 
decontaminating microorganism nurtured with a malodorous 

substance and trace pollutant in air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processed 
coconut outer husk chops. Conventionally, a sphagnum, pumice, hydroculture 
and a peat moss have been used as a planting material for 
use in cultures of flowering plants such as an orchid, a 
chrysanthemum, a carnation, a cyclamen and a Turkey broad 
beliflower, of foliage plants, of high grade vegetables 
such as a celery, a melon and a strawberry, and of fruit 
trees. These materials are easy to rot or serve to poorly 
grow plants. In particular, they cause plants to poorly 
spread their roots. Recently, in culture of vegetables such as a 
celery, a melon, a lettuce, a tomato and a strawberry, 
hydroponics has become popular in which their seeds are 
implanted in an inert medium containing no nutrient, and 
properly prepared nutrients are fed to the vegetables to 
forcibly culture them without a pollution by various germs  
 
to secure high quality and yield of the vegetables. Requirements of an inert medium for hydroponics 
are that it must have a hardness sufficient to hold a plant 
to be cultured, and pores to hold air and a nutrient 
solution, drain well, cause the root of the plant to well 
spread, and be clean. Now, rock wool is widely used as the 
inert medium for hydroponics in view of the root spread and 
the porosity. While it is not preferable that a planting 
material has a high tannin content because tannin shrinks 
the plant root to suppress growth of the plant, the ligneous 
part of the plant has a high tannin content, and coconut 
outer husk also has a high tannin content. Thus, when 
coconut outer husk is used as the culture medium, a plant 
cannot sufficiently grow on account of the influence of 
tannin. Even if coconut outer husk is repeatedly subjected 
to a water soaking in order to previously remove tannin, 
tannin seeps little by little for a long time. Thus, a 
sufficient amount of tannin cannot be removed from coconut 
outer husk. The present inventor provided in Japanese 
examined patent application publication SHO.63-52848 a 
planting material suited to a culture medium in a flowerpot 
and in a soil amelioration. This planting material 
comprises coconut outer husk chops which were compressed at 
substantially right angle to the directions of coirs and 
subsequently chopped. The compression facilitated tannin 
to seep into water during water soaking of the coconut  
 
outer husk, so that a cycle of the water soaking and the 
dehydration of the coconut outer husk is repeated twice or 
three times to sufficiently reduce the tannin

<CLAIMS>
Processed coconut outer husk chops, consisting 
essentially of coconut outer husk chops produced by 

compressing raw coconut outer husk at substantially right 
angle to the directions of coirs of the raw coconut outer 

husk and chopping the compressed coconut outer husk, wherein 
the resulting coconut outer husk chops

days and the coconut outer husk chops contain 0.1-2 wt% tannin. 
The processed coconut outer husk chops as recited 
in claim 1, further comprising: 


the coconut outer husk chops contain 0.1-1.0 wt% tannin. 
The processed coconut outer husk chops as recited 
in claim 1 or 2, further comprising: 


coirs and powder derived from the processed 
coconut outer husk chops. 
Use of the processed coconut outer husk chops as recited 
in one of claims 1 to 3 

as a planting material for 
use in a flowerpot. 
Use of the processed coconut outer husk chops as recited  
 

in one of claims 1 to 3 
as a soil conditioner. 
Use of the processed coconut outer husk chops as 
recited in one of claims 1 to 3 

as an inert medium for 
hydroponics. 
Use of the processed coconut outer husk chops as recited 
in one of claims 1 to 3 

as a microorganism propagating bed for a 
microorganism absorbing a malodorous substance in air. 
A process for producing processed coconut outer 
husk chops, comprising the steps of: 


compressing raw coconut outer husk at 
substantially right angle to the directions of coirs in the 

raw coconut outer husk; 
water soaking the compressed coconut outer husk 
together with an iron in order to swell the coconut outer husk; 
compressing the swollen coconut outer husk to be 
dehydrated; 
drying the dehydrated coconut outer husk; 
compressing the dried coconut outer husk; and 
chopping the compressed dried coconut outer husk. 
The process for producing processed coconut outer 
husk chops as recited in claim 8,  

 
wherein a cycle of said steps 

of water soaking the compressed coconut outer husk together 
with an iron in order to swell the coconut outer husk and compressing 

the swollen coconut outer husk to be dehydrated is repeated at least twice.
