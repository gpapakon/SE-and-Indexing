<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to a composition of additives for animal feed 
which includes a solution of volatile and/or irritating products in a 

liquid coagulating agent which is absorbed on a vegetable and/or mineral 
carrier in particles. 
This carrier is, at least partially, coated with coagulated protein 
particles bound to this same carrier in order to diminish the free 

contact area of the carrier. The additive composition can be advantageously 
blended with premixes or with animal feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to additives for animal nutrition and process
for preparation, as well as for animal feed containing these additives.For various reasons (improvement of digestibility, taste, etc.),
animal feed often contain additives with a volatile compound base, such
as alcohols, aldehydes, cetones and aliphatic or aromatic esters, etc.,
and/or stingy and "hot" flavours contained for example in capsicum,
peppers, mustards, horseradish, ginger, etc.Due to their volatile nature, however, these compounds evaporate
easily when the packaging is opened or when the additives are mixed with
other feed. For example, a loss of approx. 20 % is noticed when proceeding
to a dilution of 1 % in a mineral feed premix.On the other hand, these compounds often smell very strongly and
are aggressive to human skin, and then present an important inconvenience
to employees manipulating these additives when preparing animal feed.It is also known from FR-A-1 516 055 to protect aroma in food products from
degradation for example due to oxidation with an external fatty coating.
Protection coating for liquid powder is also known from US-A-4 921 705. The purpose of this invention is thus to provide a
composition of additives for animal nutrition which comprises volatile and/or
irritating products absorbed on a vegetable and/or mineral carrier, which is
not aggressive to human skin. This composition is characterized in
that the volatile and/or irritating products are absorbed as a solution thereof
together with a coagulating agent, said coagulating agent being a subsituted
phenol, on a carrier which is in particles and which is at least partially coated with
coagulated protein particles bound to this carrier so as to diminish its free contact
area. As second objective of this invention is the process for the
preparation of this composition of feed additives, characterized by
the following:
The volatile and/or aggressive products are dissolved in a first
coagulating agent composed of at least one substituted phenol,The solution obtained is absorbed on particles of a mineral and/or
vegetable carrier,A coagulable protein is blended by mixing with the mass obtained,Water is then sprayed onto this mass in the presence of a second
coagulating agent.The third objective of this invention is the animal feed containing
the above mentioned feed additives.All types of volatile products and/or hot and irritating flavours
can be used in this invention as far as they are authorized for animal
feed.As an example of volatile compounds, we

Composition of additives for animal nutrition which comprises volatile and/or
irritating products absorbed on a vegetable and/or mineral carrier, c
haracterized in
that the volatile and/or irritating products are absorbed as a solution thereof

together with a coagulating agent, said coagulating agent being a subsituted
phenol, on a carrier which is in particles and which is at least partially coated with

coagulated protein particles bound to this carrier so as to diminish its free contact
area.
Composition according to claim 1, in which the substituted phenol is chosen
among cresols, guaïacol, benzenediols, thymol, creosol, and eugenol.
Composition according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which the coagulated protein
particles are approximately spherical, with a diameter of about 50 to 200 µm, and

bound to the surface of the carrier as an agglomerate.

chosen among carboxymethylcellulose and sawdust, and the mineral carrier is

chosen among expanded silica, vermiculite and kaolin.
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 4, in which the particle size of the
carrier is between 0,1 and 1,5 mm. 
Composition according to one of claims 1 to 5, in which the protein is chosen
among animal proteins, such as milk powder, casein, lactalbumin, egg albumin

and blood meal, and vegetable proteins, such as soybean protein.

40% vegetable carrier, 0 to 20% mineral carrier, 20 to 30% volatile and/or irritating

products, 10 to 30% coagulated proteins, 2 to 5% coagulating agent and 5 to 15%
water.
Process for the preparation of a composition of additives according to one fo
claim 1 to 7, characterized by the fact that the volatile and/or irritating products are

dissolved in a first coagulating agent constituted by a substituted phenol, the
solution obtained is absorbed on particles of a mineral and/or vegetable carrier, a

coagulable protein is blended with the mass obtained by mixing and, water is
sprayed onto this mass in the presence of a second coagulating agent.
Process according to claim 8, characterized by the fact that the substituted
phenol is chosen among cresols, guaïacol, benzenediols, thymol, creosol and

eugenol.
Process according to claim 8 or claim 9, characterized by the fact that the
second coagulating agent is blended with the mass before spraying with water or

added to the water used for spraying.
Process according to claim 10, characterized by the fact that the second
coagulating agent is a tannin or oak bark when added to the mass, and is a

double aluminium potassium sulfate when added to the water used for spraying. 
Process according to one of claims 8 to 11, characterized by the fact that the
composition obtained is stored in waterproof packaging for at least two days, and

is then, if necessary, rehomogenized by mixing before use.
Premix for the preparation of animal feed, which contains a composition of
additives according to one of claims 1 to 7.
Animal feed containing a composition of additives according to one of claims 1
to 7, or a premix according to claim 13.
