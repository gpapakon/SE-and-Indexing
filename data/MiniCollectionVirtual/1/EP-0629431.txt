<ABSTRACT>
A method for extracting gaseous contaminants in the form of 
mercury and toxic, organic compounds, such as dioxins, 

furans and the like, from a gas. The method is characterized 
by first passing the gas through a first filter 

substance having selenium as an active ingredient, so as to 
take-up essentially all mercury. The essentially mercury-free 

gas is then passed through a second filter substance 
which is able to take-up toxic organic compounds and which 

can be destroyed or regenerated by combustion. The inventive 
filter arrangement includes a first filter substance 

having selenium as its active ingredient. This first filter 
substance is disposed upstream of a second filter substance 

which is capable of adsorbing or absorbing toxic, gaseous 
organic compounds, such as dioxins and furans.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for extracting 
gaseous contaminants in the form of mercury and toxic, 
organic compounds, such as dioxins, furans and the like, 
from a gas, and also to a filter arrangement for carrying 
out the method. It is known to extract gaseous mercury with the aid of a 
filter substance that contains or consists of selenium, 
selenium sulphide or other selenium compounds or mixtures 
thereof as the active ingredient. A filter which is based 
on this filter substance is normally referred to in 
practice as a "selenium filter". A selenium filter and a 
method for its manufacture are described, for instance, in 
US-A-3,786,619, and degrees of extraction or separation 
close to 100% can be achieved. A filter of this kind can be 
used generally and is particularly suitable for use when 
the mercury concentrations in the gases to be purified 
are relatively low to extremely low. One of the most 
important advantages obtained with such a filter is that 
when mercury binds to the selenium, there is formed a 
particularly stable compound, mercury selenide, HgSe, which 
can be dumped without risk of mercury being released either 
to atmosphere or into aqueous solutions. By way of an 
example of the stability of HgSe, it can be mentioned that 
about 300,000 m³ water, corresponding to the water content 
of about seventy-five 50-metre swimming pools, is required 
to release one single atom of mercury from one spoonful of 
solid HgSe. It has long been known that gaseous mercury can be taken-up 
with a filter substance comprised of active carbon with 
different additives (so-called carbon filters), for 
instance alkali sulphide and sulphur, wherein the sulphur 
can be supplied dissolved in carbosulphide, or by treating  
 
the carbon with SO₂ or H₂S, so as to form intercapillary 
precipitated sulphur, as described in DE-B-2,150,592. One 
serious drawback with carbon filters, however, resides in 
the handling of the mercury-full filters. One method of 
handling such filters is described in the aforesaid 
publication DE-B-2,150,592, in which the mercury is 
recovered by thermal distillation. This handling process, 
however, presents serious environmental problems, particularly 
with regard to the present-day strict requirements 
regarding mercury emissions. It is therefore necessary in 
practice to dump the carbon filters in the form of environ-mentally 
harmful mercury waste. As distinct from selenium 
filters, however, the mercury is not bound equally as 
effectively in carbon
