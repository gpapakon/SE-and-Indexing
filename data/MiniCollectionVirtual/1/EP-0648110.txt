<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns liquid tooth-cleaning agents which keep their flow properties over a long period. These properties are ensured by the use of xanthane as a consistency regulator in conjunction with (a) a hydroxypropyl-substituted hydrocolloid or (b) a cationic nitrogen-containing surfactant or (c) an ampholytic surfactant or (d) an N-acyl-sarcosinate or (e) an N-acyl-tauride or (f) a poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(propylene glycol) copolymer with an average molecular weight of 1,000 to 5,000 or a combination of the compounds listed in (a) to (f).

<CLAIMS>
Water- and humectant-containing tooth-cleaning 
formulations in the form of a liquid preparation with 

long-term fluidity and a viscosity of 2,000 to 10,000 and 
preferably 5,000 to 8,000 mPa·s at 25°C, xanthan in a 

quantity of 0.02 to 3.0% by weight being present as 
consistency regulator and a nitrogen-containing cationic 

or ampholytic surfactant in a quantity of 0.01 to 5.0% by 
weight being present as viscosity stabilizer (all the 

percentages by weight mentioned being based on the tooth-cleaning 
formulation as a whole). 
Tooth-cleaning formulations as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that a betaine in a quantity of 0.01 to 

1.5% by weight is present as the nitrogen-containing 
surfactant. 
Tooth-cleaning formulations as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that the betaine is lauramido- or 

cocoamidopropyl dimethyl betaine. 
Tooth-cleaning formulations as claimed in claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that xanthan is present in a 

quantity of 0.1 to 0.8% by weight. 
Tooth-cleaning formulations as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that a combination of the nitrogen-containing 

cationic or ampholytic surfactant with a 
compound from the group consisting of 


a) hydroxypropyl-substituted hydrocolloids 
b) N-acyl sarcosides 
c) N-acyl taurides or 
d) polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol copolymers 
with an average molecular weight of 1,000 to 5,000 
 
is present as the viscosity stabilizer in a quantity of 

0.1 to 10% by weight. 
Tooth-cleaning formulations as claimed in claim 5,  
 

characterized in that a hydroxypropyl-substituted hydrocolloid 
is present in a quantity of 0.01 to 0.5% by 

weight and is selected from the group consisting of 
carboxyethyl or carboxymethyl cellulose propylene glycol 

ester, alginic acid propylene glycol ester, hydroxypropyl 
cellulose or hydroxypropyl guar. 
Tooth-cleaning formulations as claimed in claim 5 or 
6, characterized in that a hydroxypropyl-substituted 

hydrocolloid is present in a quantity of 0.01 to 0.5% by 
weight and is selected from hydroxypropyl guar or alginic 

acid propylene glycol ester.
