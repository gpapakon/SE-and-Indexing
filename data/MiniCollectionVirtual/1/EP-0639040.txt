<ABSTRACT>
A static electricity dissipation system and method 
for computers includes a display/CRT antenna console 

that rests on top of the computer screen housing and 
grounds the computer screen housing by means of a carbon 

foam member attached to the underside of the display/CRT 
antenna console, a grounded metal antenna extending from 

the front of the display/CRT console and having a carbon 
fibre brush that is in physical and electrical contact 

with the computer screen, a grounded conductor that is 
connected directly to the computer CPU housing, and a 

strip of conductive carbon foam material that is 
attached to the space bar or any other primary key of 

the computer keyboard to continuously drain static 
charge away from the user. The display/CRT antenna 

console includes an LCD display chip to provide a visual 
indication each time an electrostatic charge on the user 

is dissipated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices for 
dissipating static electricity and more particularly to 
an electrostatic dissipation system and method for 
protecting apparatus comprising a cathode ray tube 
(CRT), especially computer apparatus, from harmful 
electrostatic discharges by simultaneously dissipating 
static electricity from both the user and the apparatus 
itself. Recent studies show that more than 60% of computer 
downtime is caused by static electricity. Consequently, 
one-fourth of all micro-computers are retired due to 
electrostatic discharge. It has been learned that as 
little as 250 volts of static electricity can cause data 
and memory loss, resets, erroneous commands, and damage 
to sensitive microcircuitry. In addition, harmful 
ELF/VLF radiation emanating from the computer screen is 
an unwanted byproduct of static produced by the screen 
itself and produces an unhealthy work environment. Several techniques are known in the prior art to 
prevent electrostatic discharges that may prove harmful 
to computers or other electronic equipment. US Patent 
No. 4,602,310 to Fenster teaches dissipating 
electrostatic charge under the influence of a magnetic 
field in a conductive foam body and then discharging the 
electrostatic charge to ground potential. However, 
since electrostatic charge cannot be obediently routed, 
the magnets taught in this reference serve no useful 
purpose.  US Patent No. 4,586,106 to Frazier teaches placing 
a static dissipative touch strip in a position in which 
it may be touched by the user before he or she touches 
the electronic equipment sought to be protected. 
However, since static electricity continuously builds as 
the result of such simple user movements as rolling back 
and forth in a chair, crossing the legs, or actuating a 
keyboard, the electronic equipment is likewise 
continuously in jeopardy. Similarly, US Patent No. 
4,654,746 to Lewis, Jr. et al. teaches a static 
dissipator button adapted for actuation by the user of 
equipment whenever it is desired to dissipate any 
electrostatic charge. Both the "TOUCH ME FIRST STRIP" 
of Frazier and the button of Lewis, Jr. et al. are 
ineffective since they do not continuously guard against 
electrostatic charge. It is impractical for the user to 
interrupt operation of a computer, for example, every 
few seconds in order to touch the strip of Frazier or 
actuate the button of Lewis, Jr. et al. to periodically 
dissipate any electrostatic charge. US Patent No. 4,303,960 to Sherwood et al. teaches
