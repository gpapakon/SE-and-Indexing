<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new oxazolidinedione derivative
possessing hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities and a therapeutic
agent for diabetes mellitus containing it, which are used in the
pharmaceutical field.Traditionally, various biguanide compounds and sulfonylurea
compounds have been used to treat diabetes mellitus. However, biguanide
compounds are now hardly used, since they cause lactic acid acidosis;
sulfonylurea compounds often cause severe hypoglycemia, necessitating
careful use, although they possess potent hypoglycemic activity. Various
oxazolidinedione derivatives are known to possess hypoglycemic activity
without such drawbacks.Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 170478/1991 (corresponding
to EP-A-428312) discloses a hypoglycemic compound represented by the
formula:

wherein X1 represents O or C=O. WO92/02520 discloses a hypoglycemic
compound represented by the formula:

wherein A2 represents a substitutional benzene. Japanese Patent Examined
Publication No 30993/1987 (corresponding to USP 4430337) discloses a
hypoglycemic 2,4-oxazolidinedione derivative represented by the formula:

wherein R4 represents an alicyclic hydrocarbon having a substituent.The present inventors extensively investigated the number of carbon
atoms between the oxazolidinedione ring and benzene ring in a 2,4-oxazolidinedione 
derivative and the 4-position substituent on the benzene
ring, and discovered a new derivative possessing excellent hypoglycemic and
hypolipidemic activities.Accordingly, the present invention relates to:
(1) a 2,4-oxazolidinedione derivative represented by the general
formula:

wherein X represents -CH2-, -CH(OH)- or -CH=CH-; R represents a hydrocarbon
residue or heterocyclic group each of which may have 1 to 3 sulbstituents selected
from:
(1) aliphatic chain hydrocarbon group;(2) alicyclic hydrocarbon group;(3) aryl group;(4) aromatic heterocyclic group;(5) non-aromatic heterocyclic group;(6) halogen atoms;(7) nitro group;(8) amino group which may have 1 or 2 substituents selected from alkyl groups having
1 to 10 carbon atoms, alkenyl groups having up to 10 carbon atoms, aromatic group
and acyl groups having 2 to 10 carbon atoms;(9) acyl group selected from the group consisting of formyl and groups resulting from
binding of carbonyl group with alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, alkenyl
group having up to 10 carbon atoms or aromatic group;(10) hydroxyl group, alkoxy group, alkenyloxy group, aralkyloxy group, acyloxy
group, aryloxy group;(11) thiol group, alkylthio
