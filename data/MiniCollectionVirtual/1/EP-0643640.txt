<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is related to a method for preserving wood against undesirable reactions caused by microorganisms. The invention also concerns wood preserved against molds, blue-stain fungi and rot fungi. According to the method, the wood being preserved is treated with a substance capable of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms, whereby said substance is penetrated into the wood at least essentially deeper than superficially. According to the invention, such a substance used in the method is a complexing agent, e.g., EDTA, which is capable of binding transition metals contained in the wood, whereby the complexing agent is first impregnated into the wood in a water-based solution, and subsequent to the impregnation step, the complexing agent impregnated into the wood is precipitated from the aqueous phase. The complexing agent can be precipitated by, e.g. lowering the pH of the wood, or alternatively, altering the temperature of the wood after the impregnation step. According to the invention, the complexing agent precipitated into the wood forms a reserve depot, whereby the substance re-dissolving from the depot is capable of binding transition metals entering the wood via rainwater or contamination.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method for preserving wood against undesirable reactions caused by microorganismsThe invention is a method according to the preamble of claim 1 for preserving wood against undesirable reactions caused by microorganisms.According to such a method, wood is treated with a substance capable of preventing the growth of microorganisms, whereby wood is impregnated at least essentially deeper than superficially with said substance.The invention also concerns a wood according to the preamble of claim 17, said wood being preserved against undesirable reactions caused by microorganisms.To preserve wood against decay and damage caused by microorganisms, different types of methods and preserving substances have been developed. The most common method is to impregnate wood as deep as possible with substances capable of pre¬ venting growth of microorganisms in wood. Such preserving substances typically are so-called creosote oils which provide at least a satisfactory degree of preservation. A disadvantage of such materials is, however, their general toxicity necessitating the handling of such preservative residues and wood blocks treated with them as hazardous waste.The prior art also knows approaches in which organic complexing agents or their salts are used to preserve samples of cellulose derivatives against fungal damages caused by Fungi imperfecti fungi. For instance, Rao and Kumar [J. Archaelogical Chem. 4 (1986), pp. 11-15] have investigated the inhibitory power of such complex¬ ing agents as 8-acetyl-4-methyl umbelliferone (AMU) and dehydroacetate-(3-acetyl-6- methyl-12H-pyran-2,4-(3H)dione (DHA) and copper salts thereof on the hydrolytic effect of enzymes isolated from the Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma viride mold strains on a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose substrate. The results indicate that in small concentrations the chelating agents have a relatively weak effect as such, while 

 their copper salts achieved 15 - 25 % inhibition effect at concentrations as low as 50 ppm. According to Rao and Kumar, the inhibitory effect exhibited by the chelat- ing agents and particularly their metal salts is based on their reactions with the active groups of enzymes.It is an object of the present invention to provide an entirely novel method for pre¬ serving wood such as sawn wood against undesirable reactions caused by microorga¬ nisms.The invention is based on two basic principles. Firsdy, a complexing agent is used as a substance preventing the growth of microorganisms, said agent being capable of binding
