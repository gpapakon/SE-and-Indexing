<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention consists in a new non-therapeutic
use of L-carnitine, alkanoyl L-carnitines and their pharmacologically
acceptable salts as preservative agents for
blood for transfusions.The present invention also consists in new stabilizing
solutions for the storage of blood containing L-carnitine,
alkanoyl L-carnitines or their pharmacologically acceptable
salts.What is meant by alkanoyl L-carnitines are acetyl,
propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, valeryl and isovaleryl L-carnitine.
Hereinafter, for reasons of simplicity, we shall
refer only to L-carnitine, in the understanding, however,
that the description also applies to the above-mentioned 
alkanoyl L-carnitines and their pharmacologically acceptable
salts.As is well known, L-carnitine is necessary for the
translocation of fatty acids within the mitichondria where
beta-oxidation takes place.Various uses of L-carnitine are known, but all of these
are of a therapeutic nature. For instance, L-carnitine is
used in the cardiovascular field for the treatment of acute
and chronic myocardial ischaemia, angina pectoris, heart
failure and cardiac arrhythmias.In the nephrological field, L-carnitine is administered
to chronic uraemics undergoing regular haemodialytic treatment
to combat myasthenia and the onset of muscular cramps.Other therapeutic uses have to do with the normalization
of the HDL:LDL+VLDL ratio and total parenteral nutrition.
There is, however, no relationship between the known therapeutic
uses of L-carnitine mentioned previously and the use
envisaged in the present invention.It is well known that the essential factors for good
storage of blood in the liquid state are the temperature
and the composition of the stabilizing solution.The temperature must be such as to allow a reduction of
the metabolic activity of the erythrocytes without damaging
them. The optimal temperature is 4°C ± 2°C.The stabilizing solutions must be able to make the blood
unclottable, to reduce the glycolytic activity of the red 
blood cells and, at the same time, permit such activity by
providing an adequate substrate.The efficacy of a stabilizing solution is assessed by
observing both the alterations arising in the erythgrocytes
in vitro and their survival in vivo, after variable periods
of storage at optimal temperature.The alterations to the erythrocytes in vitro can be
checked by evaluating the amount of haemoglobin released by
the erythrocytes, their osomotic and mechanical fragility,
the changes in their shape and volume and the chemical
changes they undergo.The
