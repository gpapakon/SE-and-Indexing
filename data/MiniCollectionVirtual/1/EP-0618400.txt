<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a metal vessel (1) intended to contain at least one pressurised fluid, of the type including an opening (5). The vessel (1) is equipped, over at least some (2c) of its external surface (2) with a reinforcing jacket (10) including, on the one hand, a coating (8) formed of at least one rubbery layer (7) and, on the other hand, a metal reinforcement (11, 12) embedded in the said coating (8) and formed of at least one cylindrical element (9) wound contiguously around the part (2c) of the external surface (2) of the metal vessel (1) from one of the ends of the said part (2c). The subject of the invention is also a method for reinforcing such a vessel.

Metallic vessel intended to contain at least one 
pressurized fluid, such as, for example, a pressurized-gas 

container, of the type including an opening (5), the 
said vessel (1) being provided, on at least a part (2c) 

of its external surface (2), with a reinforcing jacket 
(10) which includes, on the one hand, a covering (8) 

formed by at least one rubber layer (7) and, on the other 
hand, a metallic reinforcement (11, 12) embedded in the 

said covering (8), the metallic reinforcemont being 
formed by a metallic cylindrical element (9) wound in a 

contiguous manner around the part (2c) of the external 
surface (2) of the metallic vessel (1) starting from one 

of the ends (2a, 2b) of the said part (2c), characterized 
in that the said vessel (1) is provided with at least one 

brass layer (6), interposed between the part (2c) of the 
external surface (2) of the said metallic vessel (1) and 

the reinforcing jacket (10), and the cylindrical element 
(9) is brass-plated. 
Vessel according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the brass layer (6) has a thickness of between 0.1 

and 1 µm. 
Vessel according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the rubber layer (7) has a thickness of between 0.05 

and 5 mm and preferably between 0.1 and 1 mm. 
Vessel according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the contiguously wound metallic cylindrical element 

(9) forms an even number, greater than or equal to two, 
of superposed plies (11, 12) and includes two opposite 

ends connected together and fastened by brazing.  
 
Vessel according to Claims 1 and 4, characterized 
in that the metallic cylindrical element (9) is composed 

of at least one steel wire of diameter between 100 and 
300 µm and preferably between 150 and 250 µm. 
Vessel according to Claims 1, 4 and 5, characterized 
in that the metallic cylindrical element (9) 

constitutes a woven fabric, a braid, a cable strand or a 
wire bundle. 
Vessel according to any one of Claims 1 and 4 to 
6, characterized in that the metallic cylindrical element 

(9) is coated with a vulcanizable rubber sheath. 
Process for the mechanical reinforcement of a 
metallic vessel (1) intended to contain at least one 

pressurized fluid, such as, for example, a pressurized-gas 
container, of the type including an opening (5), in 

which process: 

at least a part (2c) of the external surface 
(2) of the said metallic vessel (1) is covered with a 

reinforcing jacket (10) which includes, on the one hand, 
a covering (8) formed by at least one rubber layer (7) 

and, on the other hand, a metallic reinforcement (11, 12) 
embedded in the said covering (8) and formed by at least 

one metallic cylindrical element (9); 
the said covering (8) is vulcanized; 
and a pressurized incompressible liquid ins 
injected via the opening (5) into the empty metallic 

vessel (1) in order to plastically deform the part (2c) 
of the external surface (2) of the said metallic vessel 

(1), 
 
characterized in that: 


at least one brass layer (6) is arranged 
between the part (2c) of the external surface (2) of the 

said metallic vessel (1) and the reinforcing jacket (10); 
the metallic cylindrical element (9) is wound 
contiguously around the coated surface, starting from one 

of the ends of the said coated surface, so as to form an 
even number, greater than or equal to two, of superposed 

plies (11, 12), the said cylindrical element (9) being 
brass-plated;  

 
the ends of the metallic cylindrical element 
(9) are connected together and fastened by brazing; and 
the reinforcing jacket (10) is vulcanized using 
the Joule effect and/or electr
omagnetic induction by 
applying an electrical voltage between the ends of the 

cylindrical element (9). 
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the metallic reinforcement (11, 12) is formed from 

a cylindrical element (9) composed of at least one steel 
wire. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the metallic reinforcement (11, 12) is formed from
