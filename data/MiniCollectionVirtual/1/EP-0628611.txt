<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a paint film with fewer craters and indentations, while 
maintaining performance as an electrodeposition paint. The electrodeposition paint 

composition contains an aqueous dispersing system containing an electrodepositable resin and 
a block polymer containing polysiloxane units and polyalkylene oxide units.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrodeposition paint composition which provides a film with 
fewer craters and indentations compared with conventional products, while maintaining 
performance as an electrodeposition paint. When coating is conducted using an electrodeposition paint, the obtained film sometimes has 
craters and indentations. One of the causes for this may be, for example, residual rust preventive 
oil which had been applied on the steel plate substrate. A possible scenario follows: when the 
film is formed by means of electrodeposition on the steel plate with some rust preventive oil still 
remaining on it and baking is conducted, residual oil drops and moisture in the electrodeposition 
paint or from a chemical conversion coating process, come together as a result of heating, and 
resulting oil drops thus splash and fall on the film surface. To prevent such a phenomenon, various additives are known to be added to electrodeposition 
paint compositions. For example, Japanese unexamined patent publication (Tokkai) Sho 58-25326 
and Tokkai Hei 2-4826 discloses process(es) in which a resin containing a polyepoxide and a 
polyoxyalkylene is added. However, electrodeposition paint compositions to which conventional additives are added 
can deteriorate the appearance of the electrodeposition paint compositions because the added resin 
has a high molecular weight. The object of this invention is to provide an electrodeposition paint composition which gives  
 
a film with fewer craters and indentations, while maintaining performance 
as an electrodeposition paint. The electrodeposition paint composition of this invention contains an 
aqueous dispersing system comprising an electrodepositable resin and a 
block polymer containing polysiloxane units and polyalkylene oxide units, 
wherein the number average molecular weight of said block polymer is 
from 1000-30000, the number average molecular weight of said polysiloxane 
units is from 100-5000, and the number average molecular 
weight of said polyalkylene oxide units is from 100-10000. The aqueous dispersing system used in this invention contains as an essential 
component an electrodepositable resin. This aqueous dispersing 
system itself can be used as an electrodeposition paint. For the electrodepositable resin, which is an essential component of the 
aqueous dispersing system, there are the anion types and the cation types, 
of which the cation types are preferable. Examples of suitable cation type 
resins are amine modified resins, resins
