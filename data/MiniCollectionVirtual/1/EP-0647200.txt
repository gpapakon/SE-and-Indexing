<ABSTRACT>
A package has a base body (1) made of a flat material which consists of a 0.05 to 0.3 mm thick aluminium strip provided on the inner side of the package with a sealable 0.001 to 0.03 mm thick plastic layer. The base body (1) has depressions (3) produced by deep-drawing for receiving the packaged goods, for example tablets (4). An aluminium closing foil (5) provided with a heat-seal lacquer coating (6) is sealed on the non-shaped area of the base body (1). The proportion of aluminium in the empty package exceeds 80 % by weight, but preferably 90 % by weight, so that the package may be easily disposed of.
