<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) serves to grind the sole (2) and the edges of skis. For this purpose, it has a working station (6) with a rotating grindstone along which skis to be ground are guided with the aid of a feeding and transporting device. The feeding and transporting device (5) has a rigid guide (10) for a ski mount (11). Located on the mount are resilient holding and pressing-on elements for connection to the respective ski. The rigid guide is arranged parallel to a predetermined working plane, and the grindstone (8) can be set at a distance from the rigid guide. As a result of this setting capability, the working plane can be fixedly predetermined and an exact assignment of a plurality of successively arranged working tools is thus possible.

A device to grind the sole and the edges of skis and 
the like, including a grinding station, said device 

having a guide for a ski holder (11) with holding and 
pressing elements (26) for skis to be ground, further 

having a feeding and conveying device (5) and a 
rotating grindstone (8), wherein the guide for the ski 

holder (11) holding the ski (4) to be ground is 
designed so as to be rigid and wherein the grindstone 

(8) with its grinding point bearing against the sole 
(2) of the ski (4) to be ground is adjustable in a 

predeterminable working plane (B) at constant distance 
to the conveyor guide (10), 
characterized in that
 the 
holding and pressing elements (26) for connecting to 

the respective ski (4) to be ground are designed so as 
to be springily yielding while the ski is ground, and 

that said springy holding and pressing elements (26) 
have a spring travel corresponding to at least 

generally the height (h) of the shovel of a ski (4) to 
be ground. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the grindstone (8) is adjustable to the predetermined 

working plane (B) according to wear and reduction of 
grindstone diameter. 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the grindstone (8) is connected 

to a positionally adjustable, particularly vertically  
 

adjustable, support (12) acted upon by an adjusting 
drive, preferably an elevating screw drive (14). 
A device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the support (12) of the grindstone has a rocker (13) 

which is pivotally mounted laterally spaced from the 
grindstone (8) and is connected to the adjusting drive 

substantially beneath the grindstone and is supported 
by said adjusting drive. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a dressing device (15) is 

arranged at the grindstone (8) and is connected to a 
positioning drive for the predeterminable profiling of 

the grindstone face. 
A device as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that 
the dressing device (15) is mounted on the grindstone 

support (12). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that, in the unloaded initial 

position, the plane of the sole of a ski to be ground 
is situated offset from the working plane (B) by at 

least the height of the shovel so as to be closer to 
the grindstone (8). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the ski holder (11) is mounted on 

a rail (30) which is adapted to be angled in relation 
to the guide plane so as to depart from a parallel 

position towards the working plane (B), that the ski 
can be placed to have its shovel end or front end at 

the rail (30) end capable of being angled, and that the 
angle of traverse is dimensioned such that when the  

 
rail is angled the ski shovel is situated offset from 

the working plane by at least the shovel height so as 
to be closer to the grindstone (8). 
A device as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that 
one end of the rail (30) capable of being angled is 

connected via a swivel bearing (31) to a carriage (23) 
belonging to the conveyor guide, and that an adjusting 

element, preferably a lift cylinder (32), particularly 
a pneumatic one, acts upon the rail in spaced 

relationship to said swivel bearing (31). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the springy holding and pressing 

elements (26) between the ski holder (11) and the ski 
(4) to be ground are constituted by in particular 

pneumatic pressing cylinders (28). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the holding and pressing elements 

(26) are positionable in their travel. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the springy holding and pressing 

elements (26) consist of elements for adjustment of 
travel and spring elements. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that a plurality of pressing cylinders 

(28) or the like, preferably six, are provided over the 
longitudinal expanse of the ski to be ground and are 

adjustable in their position and mutual spacing. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the pressing cylinders or the  

 
like are pressure controllable individually or in 

groups and are adjustable in their elastic force. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that grippers, preferably vacuum 

suction means (27) for holding the skis to be ground 
are mounted at the free ends at least of some of the 

holding and pressing elements (26) preferably 
constituted by pressing cylinders. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that the conveyor guide (10) has a 

rigid guide rail (20) for the carriage (23) adapted to 
be traversed and positioned preferably by means of a 

toothed belt (24), a chain or similar pulling element 
connected to a motor (25). 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 16, 
characterized in that at least one further grinding 

station (7), particularly with edge grinding units (17, 

17a), is associated to the station (6) for grinding the 
sole and edges of the skis, wherein the working planes 

of said edge grinding units are in alignment with and 
oriented to the station for grinding the soles. 
A device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 17, 
characterized in that the conveyor guide (10) for the 

skis (4) to be ground extends continuously over all the 
grinding stations so as to be parallel to the working
