<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hybrid magnetic
structure and a method for producing the same. In
particular, the present invention relates to a hybrid
magnetic structure in which a magnetic layer is
bonded to a supporting substrate through direct bonding and
a method for producing the same.As devices utilizing a magnetic, there are
optical isolators allowing light to pass only in a
predetermined direction by using a magneto-optic effect
and various kinds of magnetostatic wave devices using a
magnetostatic wave propagating through a magnetic. In
most cases, these devices utilize a magnetic as a magnetic
layer on another substrate or as a thin
film formed on another substrate. In the present specification,
an entire structure composed of a substrate and
a magnetic layer or magnetic film layered on the
substrate is referred to as a hybrid magnetic structure.For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 2-232606 discloses a thin film wave guiding type
optical isolator having, on a garnet single crystalline
substrate, a garnet type thin film as an intermediate
layer and another garnet type thin film as a waveguide
layer made of a magneto-optic material. This construction
is formed by a liquid phase epitaxial method.Figure 1 shows a construction of a conventional
optical isolator 201. In this figure, a substrate 101 is 
made of, for example, a gadolinium-gallium-garnet (GGG)
single crystal. The intermediate layer 104 is formed by
a liquid phase epitaxial method. As the intermediate
layer 104, yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) type materials are
used. An optical waveguide layer 102 is formed on the
intermediate layer 104 by a liquid phase epitaxial
method. As the optical waveguide layer 102, YIG type
materials are also used. On the optical waveguide
layer 102, an upper layer 103 is formed. As a material
for the upper layer 103, ZnO is used, for example. The
upper layer 103 is not indispensable. Instead of forming
the upper layer 103, the upper face of the optical
waveguide layer 102 may be exposed.Light is confined in the optical waveguide
layer 102 by providing the intermediate layer 104 having
a refractive index smaller than that of the optical
waveguide layer 102. Furthermore, the optical waveguide
layer 102 is made of a YIG type material having a magneto-optic
effect, so that it works as an optical isolator.Regarding magnetostatic wave devices, for example,
J. Castera (Journal of Applied Physics, 55(6),
pp. 2506-2511, 1984) discloses a method for producing a
magnetostatic wave device and various
