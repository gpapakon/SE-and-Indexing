<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relats to a method for processing a 
signal, and a signal processing circuit according to the 

method, in which circuit one or two transistors (T1, T2) 
switched according to the switches are used as the active 

member of the entire circuit, the charge passing through 
said transistors being controlled, in addition to the 

switches, by the transferrable charge itself so that on 
concluded transfer of charge, all current flow in the 

circuit stops by itself. By means of the present 
invention, the signal processing is, irrespective of the 

polarity of the signal (positive or negative) and of the 
threshold voltages (Uth1, Uth2) of the transistors, linear 

because the signal voltage (U
S
) is produced, as taught by 
the invention, relative to a reference voltage (U
Ref
) of 
predetermined magnitude in that a sum of the signal 

voltage (U
S
) and said reference voltage (U
Ref
) is produced 
and the polarity of said sum is every time the same as the 

polarity of the reference voltage (U
Ref
), irrespective of 
the variation of the signal voltage (U
S
), and when charge 
samples proportional to the signal voltage (U
S
) are taken, 
a quantity thereof is taken which is proportional to the 

sum (U
S
 + U
Ref
) of the signal voltage (U
S
) and the reference 
voltage (U
Ref
), whereby the charge samples pro-portional to 
said sum (U
S
 + U
Ref
) are transferred to the integrating 
capacitance (C
0
) included in the circuit, and thereafter, 
a quantity of charge samples proportional to the reference 

voltage (U
Ref
) is added into the integrating capacitance 
(C
0
) with an opposite polarity relative to the polarity of 
the charge samples proportional to said sum (U
S
 + U
Ref
).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
processing signals. In the present context, signal
processing refers to addition, difference, integration and
derivation of the voltage representing the signal, or equally,
charge or current.The voltage integrator is an ordinary circuit, implemented for
instance in filter structures using the CMOS technique. This
is demonstrated by a prior art circuit shown in Fig. 1a, being
conventionally implemented by means of an operational
amplifier. Fig. 1b shows an alternative implementation of the
state of art based on the use of capacitors switched in
discrete time. The output signal Uo of the integrator shown
in Fig. 1a is the time integral of the input voltage Ui
derived according to the following formula:
Uo(t) = -(1/RC) 0∫t Ui(t) dtSimilarly, the output signal Uo of the integrator shown in
Fig. 1b is formed by formula
Uo(t) = fs (Ci/Co)0∫t Ui(t) dt
where fs is the sampling frequency. In the sampling
capacitor Ci a charge sample of the input signal is stored
when the switches s1 and s4 are closed and the switches s2 and
s3 are open. The sample charge (Qi = Ci x Ui) is discharged in
the integrating capacitor Co by closing the switches s2 and
s3, and the switches s1 and s4 are now open. There may be
pauses between the sample storing and sample discharge stages
when all four switches s1 to s4 are open.A drawback related to state of art circuits is that the
amplifier consumes continuously current, this being of the
order of magnitude from 50 µA to several 100 µA. Moreover, the 
amplifier contains a limited bandwidth which is in general
proportional to the current consumption, and in a CMOS
implementation, harmful 1/f noise. The function of the
amplifiers such as those shown in Fig. 2 is to transfer a
signal charge taken in the sampling capacitor Ci into the
integrating capacitor Co. This is implemented when the gain of
the amplifier is infinite (in practice thousands or even
millions), for which purpose a continuous current flows in the
amplifier.The publication DE-29 33 667 shows a lossy integrator, not
consuming static current and corresponding to the passive RC
integrator. With said integrator, merely passive terminals
(i.e. those located on the real axis) can be implemented so
that the design disclosed in DE-29 33 667 is not an
appropriate element for filters in the transfer function of
which no complex terminals are contained. In publications DE-29
