Flooring component which is destined to act as 
a load support plane for a utility vehicle, 

characterised in that its body is a wave (2) of plate 
folded in a transverse succession of flat upper areas 

(3) and grooves (4) which are delimited longitudinally 
by lateral walls (22, 23), which wave (2) is formed 

from plate shaped in parallel longitudinal folds (10, 
11, 12 and 13) and has recessed transverse areas (14) 

obtained from controlled local compression of the 
lateral walls (22, 23) of the grooves (4), the bases 

(5) of the grooves (4) being drawn closer to the upper 
plane of the upper areas (3) without deformation of 

the latter, the recessed areas (14) extending on 
transverse areas of the plate in order to act as 

support surfaces for the flooring component on the 
side members (15 and 25) of a bearing structure (16).

out on transverse strips.

of two planes which intersect according to an 
intermediate folding-compression line (29 or 30). 
Component according to claim 13, 
characterised in that the straight cross-section 

profile of the grooves consists of two opposite 
adjacent trapeziums.
