<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ophthalmic
compositions and methods for preserving and using
such compositions. More particularly, the present
invention relates to ophthalmic compositions, e.g.,
useful in caring for contact lenses, which include
grapefruit seed extract as a preservative or
disinfectant, and to methods for disinfecting contact
lenses using such compositions.Various compositions, e.g., solutions, are used
in association with contact lenses to ensure that the
lenses may be safely, comfortably and conveniently
worn. Contact lens care compositions, for example,
disinfecting compositions, preserving compositions,
cleaning compositions, wetting compositions,
conditioning compositions and the like, often utilize
at least one disinfectant or at least one
preservative, depending on the type of composition,
for disinfecting or preserving contact lenses after
wear or preserving the lens care composition itself.
A contact lens disinfecting composition generally has
sufficient antimicrobial activity so that when the
composition is contacted with a lens to be
disinfected, microorganisms associated with the lens
are killed or otherwise removed and the contact lens
is effectively disinfected within a reasonable time,
e.g., in the range of about 0.1 hour to about 12
hours. A contact lens disinfecting composition may
be termed a microbio-cidal composition. In contrast,
a preserved contact lens care composition has
sufficient antimicrobial activity, often less of such 
activity than is present in a contact lens
disinfecting composition,so that when the composition
is contacted with a contact lens substantially no
increase in the microorganism population on the lens
or in the composition is obtained. A preserved
contact lens care composition may be termed a
microbio-static composition. Contact lens care
compositions are preserved to prevent any substantial
increase in the population of contaminating
microorganisms in the compositions and, thereby, to
extend their shelf life. Some preservatives used in
preserved compositions may also be used as
disinfecting agents in lens disinfecting
compositions.Various synthetic compounds are known for use as
preserving agents in preserved contact lens care
compositions. Examples include thimerosal,
benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine. However,
these synthetic preserving agents are known to
exhibit ocular toxicity which may result in
irritation or sensitivity to the eye. The degree of
ocular toxicity increases when these agents are
utilized as disinfecting agents. Further,

<CLAIMS>
A method for disinfecting a contact lens
comprising:


contacting a contact lens with a
composition including an effective disinfecting

amount of grapefruit seed extract at conditions
effective to disinfect said contact lens.
The method of claim 1 wherein said
composition includes a liquid aqueous medium.
The method of claim 2 wherein said
grapefruit seed extract is present during said

contacting in an amount in the range of about 0.001%
to about 5% by weight per volume of said liquid

aqueous medium.
The method of claim 2 wherein said contact
lens after being disinfected is contacted with a

second liquid aqueous medium prior to being placed in
the eye of the wearer of said contact lens.
The method of claim 1 which further
comprises contacting said contact lens in a liquid

medium with at least one enzyme capable of removing
debris from a contact lens in an amount effective to

remove debris from said contact lens.
A composition useful for disinfecting a
contact lens comprising a liquid aqueous medium and,

included therein, an effective contact lens
disinfecting amount of grapefruit seed extract and an

effective pH buffering amount of a buffer component. 
The composition of claim 6 which further
comprises an effective amount of a tonicity adjustor

component.
The composition of claim 6 which further
comprises an effective amount of a wetting component.
The composition of claim 6 wherein said
grapefruit seed extract is present in an amount in

the range of about 0.001% to about 5% by weight per
volume of said composition.
The composition of claim 6 which further
comprises at least one enzyme capable of removing

debris from a contact lens in an amount effective to
remove debris from a debris laden contact lens.
