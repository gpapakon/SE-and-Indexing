<ABSTRACT>
A device for thermal printing on paper (26), comprising a thermal printing head (2) engaging a paper feed roller (15). The printing head is resiliently supported by a fixed frame portion (1) whereas the feed roller (15) is supported by a movable frame portion (13) hinged to the fixed portion (1) and forming an access cover for the device compartment housing the paper roll (12). The contact region between the line (4) of heating elements on the printing head (2) and the feed roller (15) for the paper (26) is located above a roller diameter (14) that passes through the hinge between the movable frame portion (13) and the fixed frame portion (1) when the cover is closed.

A thermal printing device for printing on
a paper (26) comprising on a chassis a thermal print head

(2) having row (4) of heating points and a paper drive
roll (15), the chassis including a fixed portion (1)

carrying the print head (2) and a cover (13) carrying the
roll (15) hinged to the fixed portion between a position

in which the head (2) and the roll (15) are spaced apart
and a position in which the head (2) bears against the

roll (15) while, downstream from the print head (2) in
the paper travel direction, the fixed portion (1) of the

chassis is provided with the movable blade (20) of a
cutting member, the stationary blade (21) of this member

being carried by the cover (13) characterized in that the
contact zone of the row (4) of heating prints of the

print head (2) on the paper drive roll (15) is located
behind the plane including the diameter (14) of said roll

that passes through the hinge of the cover (13) to the
fixed portion of the chassis in the closeness direction

of the cover in order to form a resilient retaining latch
of the cover when closed.
A device according to claim 1, characterized
in that the portion (2a) of the print head (2) situated

in front of the row (4) of heating points is shaped to
offer a cam-forming surface for displ
acing the head (2)
against the force of a resilient member (9) when the roll

(15) goes past in the closeness direction of the cover.
A device according to claim 2, characterized
in that the stationary blade (21) is carried by a support

(22) resiliently attached to the cover (13), and in that
said support (22) of the stationary blade presents,

upstream from a cutting edge, in the paper travel
direction, a surface (25) for deflecting the path of the

paper (26), which surface forms an obtuse angle with a
tangent to the paper drive roll (15) at the row (4) of

heating points.
