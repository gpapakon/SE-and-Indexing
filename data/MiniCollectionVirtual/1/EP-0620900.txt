<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to torque control shutoff clutches for power 
tools and the like as disclosed e.g. in GB-A-1 213 948 and more particularly to a controlled fluid shutoff and reset 
mechanism for a fluid operated tool. Fluid operated tools for driving fasteners and the like typically incorporate a 
rotary vane air motor to drive a rotary shaft connected to a tool bit. Such tools are 
often equipped with a clutch mechanism that responds to the torque imparted by the 
tool to the fastener. When a specific torque is reached, the clutch mechanism 
automatically decouples the motor from the tool bit and terminates further tool output 
to the fastener. It is desirable that the decoupling and shutoff occur as cleanly and as closely as 
possible to a desired applied torque. If the motor is not decoupled there occurs 
substantial inertial followup which may overtighten the fastener and lead to greater 
torque reaction on the operator. If the motor is not shut off upon clutch release it will 
continue to run without accomplishing useful work until the operator shuts it off.  
 In addition, an automatic reset of the mechanism is a 
desirable feature. A particular problem of prior art 
devices has been the inability to achieve clean clutch jaw 
disengagement and lockout near the point of shutoff thereby 
producing damage to the clutch face components and a 
ratcheting impact effect as the device coasts to a stop. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a torque control clutch of the type comprising a rotary 
driven clutch shaft element having a stepped axial bore 
adapted to be driven at one end of a motor; an output 
clutch spindle mounted for rotation within said stepped 
axial bore; a cam shaft mounted in said axial bore for both 
rotation and reciprocation along the axis of said axial 
bore; said cam shaft being capable of axially reciprocating 
in response to the rotational position of said cam shaft in 
said bore; and a means is provided for selectively coupling 
said cam shaft to said output clutch spindle for rotation 
of said output clutch spindle in response to the axial 
position of said cam shaft relative to said clutch shaft, 
and characterised in that a cylindrical cam block is 
rotatably disposed within said axial bore of said clutch 
shaft for selectively rotatably engaging said cam shaft to 
resist relative rotation of said cam shaft in said axial 
bore during a selected torque rise and thereafter assisting 
rotation of said cam shaft once a selected torque level is 
ac
