<ABSTRACT>
The procedure consists of passing a hydrodynamic flow of components through a channel (5) contg. a non-streamlined body (7) which ensures a localised convergence of the flow and a hydrodynamic cavitation field after it. The localised convergence can be carried out at two or more points along the flow channel, shaped and spaced to maintain a flow speed in each section relative to the outlet flow speed of at least 2:1, and a level of cavitation of at least 0.5. The localised convergence sections are located one after another or parallel to one another in a single cross-sectional zone of the flow channel. The procedure is carried out in a claimed appts. comprising a housing (1) with an inlet and outlet (2,3) linked to its central section by convergent (4) and divergent (6) sections. The non-streamlined body (7) is made from at least two components, the shape of which are the distance between them ensures the formation of a hydrodynamic field behind each.
