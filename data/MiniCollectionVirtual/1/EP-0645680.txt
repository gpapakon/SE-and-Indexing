<ABSTRACT>
Electrophotographic elements including near-infrared radiation absorbing 

sensitizers and selected near-infrared radiation absorbing additives exhibit a reduced 
tendency toward the formation of laser interference patterns. These elements can be 

utilized in electrophotographic imaging processes including the steps of 
electrostatically charging the element, imagewise exposing the charged element to 

near-infrared radiation to form an electrostatic latent image, developing the 
electrostatic latent image by applying charged toner particles to the element to produce 

a toned image, and transferring the toned image to a suitable receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrophotographic elements and a method of 
exposing such elements with near-infrared radiation. Photoconductive elements for use in electrophotographic imaging are well 
known. Photoconductive elements are used for conventional optical exposures such as 
those commonly utilized in photocopies and photoduplicators. Photoconductive 
elements are also known which can be imaged either by an array of light emitting 
diodes (LEDs) or by scanning laser exposure. With either LED or laser exposure, the 
image to be reproduced has been converted by a variety of means into a stream of 
digital information. Machines which employ digitally imaged photoconductive 
elements are generally referred to as printers, sometimes laser printers. The lasers or LEDs which are used to carry out digital imaging generally emit 
light in the near-infrared (near-IR) region of the spectrum, defined for the purposes of 
this invention as light having a wavelength in the range of 650 to 900 nm. 
Accordingly, the photoconductive elements must be capable of absorbing light in this 
wavelength range. Many near-IR sensitive photoconductive elements exhibit problems 
affecting their performance. For example, when such elements are imaged with 
relatively high power near-IR lasers, the near-IR absorbing dye or pigment present in 
the photoconductive element may fail to absorb all of the incident light emitted by the 
laser. As a result, the excess, unabsorbed light generates an image artifact generally 
known as a laser interference pattern (also known as "plywood" or "wood grain" 
effect). Other solutions to this problem have included use of a conductive support 
having a roughened surface as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Serial Nos. 
162975/83, 171057/83, 112049/85. Another potential solution is the use of a support 
having a light scattering layer, on the side opposite the photosensitive layer, which 
prevents laser radiation from being reflected back to the photosensitive layer thereby 
causing the laser interference pattern as disclosed in US-A-4,756,993 and US-A-5,051,328. 
However, these solutions for the problem of laser interference patterns are 
not without disadvantages. They introduce further complexity into the formation of 
the element, lessen the versatility of the element, and decrease the performance of the 
electrophotographic element. From the foregoing it can be seen that there is a need for 
the provision of easily manufactured photoconductive elements which largely eliminate 
laser
