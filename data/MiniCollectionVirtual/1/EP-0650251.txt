<ABSTRACT>
Current flow in an inductor (7) from an unstabilised DC-voltage 
source (4,5) is switched on and off by a series-connected 

FET (8) under control of a latch circuit (10). 
The circuit (10) switches the FET (8) off in response to 

the attainment of a predetermined voltage across a 
resistance (9) in the series circuit, and switches the 

FET (8) on again in response to individual pulses of a 
constant-frequency pulse generator (14). Constant power 

output of the circuit to power a xenon tube (1) for a 
flashing-beacon is derived from a capacitor (6) that is 

charged via a diode (13) from the current-backswing of 
the inductor (7). The latch circuit (10) may 

alternatively (Figure 3) be switched off from the voltage 
across a capacitor (24) in a resistance-capacitance 

circuit connected in parallel with the series FET (8) and 
inductor (7), a switch device (26) that shunts the 

capacitor (24) being operated in unison with the 
switching of the latch circuit (10), to discharge the 

capacitor (24) in the intervals between conduction of the 
FET (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inverter circuits of the kind 
in which switching means is connected in series with 
inductance across the DC-voltage input terminals of the 
circuit. Inverter circuits of this specified kind for converting 
DC input voltage to higher-voltage AC (or pulse) output 
are known and find application, for example, in the 
powering of discharge tubes such as xenon flash-discharge 
tubes. Xenon flash-discharge tubes are used to produce 
repetitive short-duration flashes of light for beacon 
purposes in giving visual alarm or warning of hazard, and 
in this respect may be used on burglar and fire alarm 
boxes and may take the place of rotating-mirror beacon 
devices as used on police, ambulance and fire-service 
vehicles. In many applications and potential applications of xenon 
tubes in this way, the voltage of the available power 
supply to the inverter circuit is liable to fluctuate 
significantly. For example, in the case of use on a 
vehicle having a nominally 12-volt battery, the power 
supply may well vary from 11 volts under load while the 
engine is not running, to as much as 16 volts when the 
engine is running with the battery fully charged. Using 
an inverter circuit of known form to power a xenon tube 
in such conditions is generally unsatisfactory since for 
optimum operation the energising power to the tube is 
required to be maintained at a particular value, and this 
cannot be readily achieved with known circuits in those 
conditions.  It is one of the objects of the present invention to 
provide a form of inverter circuit of the specified kind, 
for providing a power output which, within a range of 
variation of DC-voltage input, is substantially 
independent of such variation. According to the present invention an inverter circuit of 
the specified kind is characterised in that the switching 
means is arranged to be switched on and off sequentially 
in accordance with the switching of latching means back 
and forth between two states, that the latching means is 
arranged to be switched from a first to a second of its 
two states in accordance with attainment of a 
predetermined current flow within the series circuit and 
then back from its second state to its first state by 
individual pulses of a pulse train of substantially 
constant pulse recurrence frequency supplied to the 
latching means, and that the power output of the circuit 
is derived from the backswing of current flow in the 
inductance when the switching means is switched off such 
that the power output
