<ABSTRACT>
A plate removal apparatus in a rotary printing
press, which removes outside a printing unit (4A-4D) a plate (P1)

unfixed from a plate fixing unit (25) of a plate cylinder (20) in
the printing unit, includes a first guide member (55) and a

regulating member (68). The first guide member falls inside
the printing unit in removing the plate from the plate

cylinder to guide the plate removed from the plate
cylinder outside the printing unit. The regulating

member is interlocked with falling operation of the
first guide member to prevent the plate guided by the

first guide member from entering into the printing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a plate removal
apparatus in a rotary printing press, which removes an
old plate set on a plate cylinder from the plate
cylinder.A plate removal apparatus of this type
generally employs a structure for preventing a removed
old plate from entering into the printing press and
contacting an inking device in the printing press. A
plate removal guide mechanism is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 11-77968. The plate removal guide
structure disclosed in this reference has a cassette
swingably supported by frames and having an old plate
storage unit for storing an old plate and an actuator
for moving the cassette between a plate mounting
position and a retreat position.In this arrangement, the cassette is moved to
the plate mounting position upon operating the actuator,
and the distal end of the cassette is opposed to the
plate fixing unit of the plate cylinder. In this state,
when the plate cylinder is rotated almost one revolution,
an old plate whose leading and trailing edges are
unfixed from the plate fixing unit of the plate cylinder 
is stored in the old plate storage unit. In this manner,
since the removed old plate is stored in the old plate
storage unit, the old plate will not fluctuate or enter
into contact with the inking device in the printing
press.The conventional plate removal apparatus
described above requires the old plate storage unit for
storing an old plate, a large cassette is required. The
large cassette narrows the work space between printing
units to degrade workability in maintenance and
inspection. A large actuator is required to move the
large cassette, resulting in a large, complicated
apparatus.EP-A-0 933 206 discloses a plate removal apparatus
according to the preamble of independent claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a plate removal apparatus in a rotary printing
press, in which workability in maintenance and
inspection is improved.It is another object of the present invention
to provide a compact, simple plate removal apparatus in
a rotary printing press.In order to achieve the above objects of the
present invention, there is provided a plate removal
apparatus in a rotary printing press, which removes
outside a printing unit a plate unfixed from a plate
fixing unit of a plate cylinder in the printing unit,
comprising a first guide member falling inside the 
printing unit in removing the plate from the plate
cylinder to guide the plate removed from the plate
cylinder outside the printing unit, and a regulating
member
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A plate removal apparatus in a rotary printing press,
which removes outside a printing unit (4A-4D) a plate

(P1) unfixed from a plate fixing unit (25) of a plate
cylinder (20) in said printing unit, comprising


a first guide member (55) falling inside said printing
unit in removing said plate from said plate cylinder to

guide said plate removed from said plate cylinder
outside said printing unit; 
characterised in that
a regulating member (68) is provided, interlocked with
the falling operation of said first guide member (55)

to prevent said plate guided by said first guide member
from entering into said printing unit.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein

said apparatus further comprises a link
mechanism (66) for coupling said first guide member and

said regulating member, and
said regulating member is interlocked with the
falling operation of said first guide member through

said link mechanism.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein

said printing unit has an opening (58a) open
in a horizontal direction, 
said first guide member comprises a guide
plate pivotally supported at a lower end thereof and

always held substantially vertically,
said regulating member comprises a regulating
plate pivotally supported at an upper end thereof and

always held substantially horizontally in said printing
unit, and
when said guide plate is inclined at a
predetermined angle, said regulating plate pivots

through substantially 90Â° in a vertical state, thereby
closing the opening through said link mechanism.
An apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising:


a plate catch member (75) for holding a
trailing edge of said plate removed from said plate

cylinder through said first guide member; and
a second guide member (63) for guiding to said
plate catch member said trailing edge of said plate

guided by said first guide member.
An apparatus according to claim 4, wherein

said second guide member comprises
a guide portion (63a) horizontally extending
from an end portion to a central portion of a plate

removal path surface of said printing unit at a
predetermined interval, and 
a leg (63b) for supporting said guide portion
in a cantilevered manner, and
said plate held by said plate catch member and
said second guide member is removed from an open end side

of said guide portion.
An apparatus according to claim 5, further
comprising a photoelectric sensor (77a) for detecting

said trailing edge of said plate held by said plate
catch member and confirming removal of said plate from

said plate cylinder.
An apparatus according to claim 5, further
comprising a plate pushout member (70) for pushing a

leading edge of said plate held by said plate catch
member and second guide member outside said printing

unit.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein

said printing unit has an opening (58a) on a
plate removal path side,
said first guide member is disposed in the
plate removal path from said plate cylinder to be

declinable regarding lower end axis, and
said second guide member is disposed in the
plate removal path downstream of said first guide member 

and interlocked with falling operation of said first
guide member to close the opening.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein

when said regulating member is in a horizontal
state, maintenance of said printing unit is allowed, and
when said regulating member is in a vertical
state, said plate is prevented from entering into said

printing unit.
