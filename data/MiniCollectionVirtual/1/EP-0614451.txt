<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing cement is described, by which gypsum is added to the clinker in the clinker cooler (3). Hereby it is obtained that the gypsum is dried in a safe, simple and inexpensive manner without substantial additional costs for establishment and operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing 
cement. Hitherto, in manufacturing cement it has been common 
practice that the finish-burnt and cooled clinker material 
is mixed with gypsum and possibly other additives and 
subsequently finish-ground in a grinding plant. The added gypsum usually contains water which is required 
to be removed to avoid setting of the cement, and in 
grinding plants comprising a tube mill, the dehydration and 
drying of the gypsum often take place in the mill, in which 
the temperature is relatively high. Tube mills are, however, relatively much energy-demanding, 
and in fact the tendency today is that roller mills are 
used instead for finish-grinding of cement due to their 
higher efficiency. However, the temperature in roller mills is rarely so high 
that a sufficient drying of the added gypsum is obtained, 
which has an adverse influence on the cement properties. This problem have been solved by adding gypsum which, 
before the addition, is dehydrated and dried in a separate 
drying installation, but this increases the preliminary 
expenses as well as the operating costs. Another proposed solution to the problem consists of 
heating the material during the grinding by means of gas 
from a heat generator or by means of excess air from a 
clinker cooler, but as the retention time in, e.g., a 
roller mill is very short, the possibilities of obtaining 
a sufficient drying of the gypsum are very small.  
 From e.g. DD-201137, SU-011735 and GB-1551269 it is known 
to introduce material components containing gypsum or the 
like into the zone between the kiln and the clinker cooler 
or into the first part of the clinker cooler, where the 
temperature typically is in the range from 800 to 1400Â°C. The disadvantage by introducing the gypsum into or before 
the first and thereby the hottest part of the clinker 
cooler is that the gypsum is converted into insoluble 
anhydride which when the finish-ground cement is used for 
making cement paste, mortar or concrete has lost its 
desired effect which is to delay the setting of the cement. The object of the invention is therefore to provide for a 
method for manufacturing cement, by which method the 
abovementioned disadvantages by the known methods are 
avoided. According to the invention, this object is obtained by a 
method of the kind mentioned in the introduction, and which 
is characterized in that at least a part of the gypsum 
required for the cement manufacturing is added to the 
clinker in the last section of
