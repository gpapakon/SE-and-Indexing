<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for retarding hair loss and for 
stimulating its regrowth. Devices of the aforesaid type are known comprising one or more 
moving members for mechanically massaging the scalp and in 
particular those parts of the head where hair loss is greatest. Satisfactory retarding of hair loss cannot be obtained with known 
devices. Moreover these devices are uncomfortable to handle, they are 
relatively heavy and are tiring to use as they have to be held in 
contact with the head for relatively long periods. Apparatus have recently been proposed which have proved of some 
interest in retarding hair loss and stimulating its growth, such 
apparatus using pulsating electrostatic fields (see for example 
the articles by W. Stuart Maddin published in the International 
Journal of Dermatology, July-August '90, vol. 29 No 12, and 
December '92, vol. 31, No. 12). These apparatus comprise a helmet 
provided with electrically conducting plates connected to large 
pulsating electrostatic field generators. Although the impedance of the output circuit of this apparatus is 
so high as to limit the delivered current to a value which is 
completely harmless even if the scalp makes direct contact with 
the plates, this does not eliminate the unpleasant and dangerous 
effect deriving therefrom. It is also difficult to adjust the  
 
depth of action of the electrostatic field, consequently requiring 
a relatively complicated and costly regulator circuit. The 
electrostatic apparatus of the aforesaid type also has a very low 
maximum energy efficiency when powered by 12 volt batteries or the 
like, this voltage being converted into a much higher voltage to 
achieve the desired results. An object of the present invention is to provide a device of the 
aforesaid type which is easy and comfortable to use without risk, 
is of small overall size, is easily adjustable by a normal user, 
and in particular is effective in retarding hair loss and 
stimulating its regrowth. A further object is to provide a low-cost device of simple 
construction. These and further objects which will be apparent to an expert of 
the art are attained by a device in accordance with the 
accompanying claims. The present invention will be more apparent from the accompanying 
figures, which are provided by way of non-limiting example and in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic view of a first embodiment of the device; 
and Figure 2 is a schematic view of a second embodiment. Figure 1 shows a support element 1 with which there are

<CLAIMS>
A device for retarding hair loss and for stimulating its 
regrowth, characterised by comprising an electrical puls
e 
generator (3, 4) connected to at least one electrically conducting 

cable (2, 20) extending within a shaped structure to be applied to 
a person's skull, said pulses being such as to generate about said 

cable a pulsating electromagnetic field having an intensity of at 
least 1 gauss in proximity to the conductor. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
electromagnetic field is exhausted at about 5 mm from the surface 

of the cable (20). 
A device as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that said electrical pulses have a duration of about 2 

milliseconds and are repeated with a frequency of about fifty 
pulses per second. 
A device as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that said conducting cable (20) is distributed in the form of 

nooses or loops within said shaped structure. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that that 
surface of said conducting cable (20) which is to face the user's 

skull is protected by a plastic film. 
A device as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that said 
conducting cable (20) is enclosed within a sealed plastic bag. 
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that said 
bag can be inflated by the user by means of a pump connected to 

said bag.
