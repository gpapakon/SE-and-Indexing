<ABSTRACT>
To improve testability of analog or mixed analog/digital circuit modules 
mounted on a carrier, three-way switches (301-307) are 

placed at input and output ports (IN1-IN3,OUT1-OUT3) of the 
circuit modules. The switches can operate to establish signal connections between a test 

bus (ATB1,ATB0) and core circuits (304) inside the modules. 
The switches can also establish signal 

connections between the test bus and glue circuits disposed between the modules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to testing analog circuit modules and in particular
analog circuit modules on a carrier or printed circuit board.The invention is an improvement on U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,208.
This prior art scheme is particularly suited to dividing
integrated circuits into submodules for testing.The invention is also related to the field of boundary scan of digital
circuits. A general scheme for testing digital circuits on a carrier has been proposed in
IEEE Std 1149.1-1990, "IEEE Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan
Architecture". This scheme allows digital circuits to be designed for testability.Another digital testing scheme, which uses a divide and conquer
approach, is found in E. J. McCluskey and S. Boaorgui-Nesbat, "Design for
Autonomous Test", IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol. C-30, No. 11, pp. 886-875,
11/81.Analog circuits also need to be designed for testability. The typical analog
circuit is more difficult to test than the typical digital circuit, for reasons including the
following. Analog modules are tightly coupled, with everything depending on
everything else. Design margins are tight for analog circuits, as compared with large
safety margins built into digital circuits. Analog circuits have complex signal types,
which mean that direct access is usually required in order to observe or control analog
signals, unlike digital signals which can be easily observed/controlled using shift
registers. There is no ability to freeze internal states, such as charge on capacitors, of
analog circuits, while the digital circuits have enable signals or clocks. Analog circuits
are sensitive to input noise and output loading effects. Analog circuits do not have well-defined
I/O port types. A single port may serve multiple purposes, such as
charging/discharging of a capacitor, plus detection of threshold voltages, so that
classification into either "input" or "output" may be obscured. There is no formal
specification for analog functions, unlike the simple boolean equations or hardware 
description languages used in the digital world. There are no elementary and universal
fault models for marginal failures in analog circuits, unlike the "stuck-at-0/1" models
which were highly successful in digital circuits, but are not sufficient in the analog
world.Some design for testability schemes for analog/mixed signal circuits have
been presented.Known schemes suffer from some or all of the following drawbacks.
They are not hierarchical, i.e. they do not apply uniformly to both chip and
board
