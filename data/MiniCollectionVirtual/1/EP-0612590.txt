<ABSTRACT>
Trestle comprising a horizontal beam and two 
pairs of legs which are connected at their top end to the 

beam, the legs of each pair extending on either side of 
the beam and diverging at their lower end, the trestle 

being provided with a saw attachment which is preferably 
removable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a trestle comprising a 
horizontal beam and two pairs of legs which are connected 
at their top end to the beam, the legs of each pair 
extending on either side of the beam and diverging at 
their lower end, and provided with a saw attachment. 
A trestle of this kind is disclosed in US-A-3.225.865. 
Said patent specification describes a trestle of the kind 
indicated, in which the saw attachment consists of a 
conventional mitre box screwed onto the beam. Said construction has all the limitations of the 
conventional mitre box. Thus, the dimensions of the 
workpieces to be mitred using said mitre box are 
restricted by the internal dimensions of the mitre box 
used. In addition, the mitre box has to be screwed off 
every time the trestle is to be used per se. The object of the invention is to provide a 
trestle which does not have these disadvantages, or has 
these disadvantages to a far lesser degree, and can 
readily be adjusted to the various uses. This object is achieved according to the invention 
in that the saw attachment is formed by a transverse 
groove, one flank of which lies at right angles to the 
longitudinal axis of the beam, and by two transverse 
grooves which extend at an angle of 45° relative to the 
longitudinal axis of the beam and which mutually enclose 
an angle of 90°, one flank of each of the three grooves 
being at least partially extended to above the face of the 
beam by means of a common thickening. The trestle according to the invention imposes 
substantially fewer restrictions on the workpieces to be  
 
mitred than the known trestle. An added advantage of the 
construction of the saw attachment is that the underside 
of the workpiece to be sawn does not rest on the bottom of 
the saw attachment, as a result of which damage to this 
bottom during sawing is prevented. In contrast, when using 
the conventional mitre box, the teeth of the saw 
inevitably come into contact with the bottom of the box 
and the guiding slots for the saw, so that these will 
become damaged even during normal use. Preferably, the top side of the beam, viewed in 
the longitudinal direction, consists of two mutually 
parallel flat sections, divided by a central section which 
runs parallel to and protrudes above the parallel 
sections. The central section is preferably provided with 
edges running parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 
beam and protruding above the top face of the beam. Said 
edges serve as stop for elongated pieces to be processed, 
such as boards and

Trestle comprising a horizontal beam and two pairs of 
legs which are connected at their top end to the 

beam, the legs of each pair extending on either side 
of the beam and diverging at their lower end, and 

provided with a saw attachment, characterized in that 
the saw attachment is formed by a transverse groove, 

one flank of which lies at right angles to the 
longitudinal axis of the beam, and by two transverse 

grooves which extend at an angle of 45° relative to 
the longitudinal axis of the beam and which mutually 

enclose an angle of 90°, one flank of each of the 
three grooves being at least partially extended to 

above the face of the beam by means of a common 
thickening. 
Trestle according to Claim 1, in which the top side 
of the beam, viewed in the longitudinal direction, 

consists of two mutually parallel flat sections, 
divided by a central section which runs parallel to 

and protrudes above the parallel sections. 
Trestle according to Claim 2, in which the saw 
attachment and the central section form one separate 

entity that can be attached to the remaining part of 
the trestle by means of a releasable connection. 
Trestle according to Claim 3, in which the beam is 
provided with (a) a recess comprising at least two 

grooves which mutually enclose an angle of 90° and 

run at an angle of 45° relative to the longitudinal 
axis of the beam and extend from a transverse side of 

the beam to one of the longitudinal sides of the 
beam; and a transverse groove extending across the 

width of the beam and running at right angles to the 
longitudinal axis of the beam, which transverse 

groove intersects the two grooves mentioned; and in 
which the external dimensions of the saw attachment 

are essentially identical with the internal 
 

dimensions of the recess (a) so that it can be accommodated 
therein so as to fit; and the saw attachment 

is provided with a thickening in the shape of a 
straight prism whose side faces are at right angles 

to the face defined by grooves, of which sides at 
least one runs at a right angle to the longitudinal 

axis of the beam and two other sides mutually enclose 
an angle of 90° and run at an angle of 45° to the 

longitudinal axis of the beam; and which thickening 
protrudes above the top face of the beam, and with 

(b) a longitudinal groove which runs in the 
longitudinal direction of the beam, which longitudinal 

groove can accommodate the central section so 
that it can be detached. 
Trestle according to Claim 4, in which the central 
section is provided with edges running parallel to 

the longitudinal axis of the beam and protruding 
above the top face of the beam. 
Trestle according to one of Claims 2-5, wherein the 
central section is formed, at least partly, in the 

shape of a cavity, in which small objects can be 
accommodated. 
Trestle according to one of Claims 1-6, wherein the 
beam is provided with a V-shaped slot in its 

transverse direction. 
Trestle according to one of Claims 1-7, wherein at 
least one of the legs is provided with a means for 

adjusting the length of the leg. 
Trestle according to one of Claims 1-8, wherein at 
least one pair of legs is additionally connected to 

each other by means of a flange plate or one or more 
transverse connections.
