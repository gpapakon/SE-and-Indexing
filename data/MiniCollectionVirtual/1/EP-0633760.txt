<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tape tab fastener
systems for disposable absorbent articles, more
particularly to tape tab fastener systems combining
mechanical and adhesive tape tab fastener means in a design
with improved handling characteristics, improved
construction stability and which is compatible with
compression packaging. The use of tape tab fastener systems for securing the
corners of disposable absorbent articles such as diapers or
incontinents briefs is well known in the art. Examples of
adhesive tape tab fastener systems are disclosed in US
Patent RE 26,151, US Patent 3,848,594 and many other
publications. While adhesive tape tab fastener systems did
provide secure means for fixing a disposable absorbent
article around a user's waist during use they were not
totally satisfactory.Adhesive tape tab fastener systems were often only
usable upon initial fixation of the disposable absorbent
article while refastening was not possible. They also
displayed unsatisfactory resistance against contamination.Hence the prior art discloses many alternative
fastener systems trying to solve these problems. For
example mechanical fastener systems of the hook/loop type
(random entanglement) have been contemplated and disclosed
in many publications. In general mechanical fastener
systems have the advantage of reduced or no sensitivity
versus contamination for example by oils or powders.
Mechanical hook/loop fastener systems also have the
advantage of being reclosable after opening for example to
check the soiling of absorbent articles or to correct the
fitting of absorbent articles on the wearer. However,
mechanical fasteners require a two part fastening system
e.g. tape tabs with hooks and a landing surface with loops.Mechanical tape tab fasteners of the hook/loop type
have been disclosed for use in diapers for example in US
Patent 3,110,312 and for disposable diapers in US Patent
4,259,957 or European Patent Application EP-A-235014. After establishing the principal advantages of
mechanical fasteners over adhesive tape tab fasteners, it
was found that mechanical fasteners lack the ease of
disposability which the adhesive tape tab fasteners
provided for disposable absorbent articles. Before
disposing a used disposable absorbent article the article
is often rolled up upon itself. This pack is then closed
by applying the adhesive tape tab onto the outside surface
of the rolled up disposable absorbent article.The advantage of disposability is supplied by adhesive
tape tabs which can be attached anywhere to the

A disposable absorbent article having an inside surface (44) and an outside
surface (46), longitudinal side edges (40) in the longitudinal direction, a first and a

second lateral end edge (42) in the lateral direction, a first end region (48) and a second
end region (50), said absorbent article comprising:


a body portion (22) defined by said longitudinal side edges (40) and said first and
second lateral end edges (42);
an adhesive-mechanical fastening tape tab (60) having a manufacturer's region (74)
and a user's region (75); said tape tab (60) being disposed in said lateral first end region

(48) such that said manufacturer's region (74) is joined to said absorbent article (20) and
said user's region (75) extends beyond said longitudinal side edge (40) of said

absorbent article (20); said user's region (75) having a proximal region to said
longitudinal side edge (40) and a distal region to said longitudinal side edge (40); said

proximal region comprising an adhesive fastening member (63) and said distal region
comprising a mechanical fastening member (62) and a grip tab (61), said adhesive

fastening member (63) and said mechanical fastening member (62) each having their
fastening surface oriented in the same direction as said i
nside surface (44); said grip tab

a mechanical fastening landing member (64) for co-operation with said mechanical
fastening member (62) of said adhesive-mechanical fastening tape tab (60), said landing

member (64) being disposed in said lateral second end region (50) and joined to said
outside surface (46) of said absorbent article (20); and
said grip tab (61) extending over part of distal region of said user's region (75) and
provided by folding said laterally outward edge (72) of user's region (75) back onto itself,

characterised in that

said grip tab (61) extends over part of said mechanical fastening member (62).
Disposable absorbent article (20) according to claim 1 wherein said grip tab (61)
is continuous with said proximal region of said user's region (75).
Disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of the preceding claims
wherein said absorbent article (20) further comprises a release tape (65), said release

tape (65) being disposed on said inside surface (44) of said absorbent article (20) to cooperate 
with said adhesive-mechanical fastening tape tab (60) during storage and

transport of said absorbent article (20).
Disposable absorbent article (20) according to claim 3 wherein said release tape
(65) is joined to said inside surface (44) of said absorbent article (20) by an adhesive.
Disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of the preceding claims
wherein said proximal region and said distal region of said user's region (75) are

continuous and have a continuous adhesive layer to form said adhesive fastening
member (63) in said proximal region, and said mechanical fastening member (62) being

joined to said adhesive-mechanical fastening tape tab (60) by said continuous adhesive
layer.
Disposable absorbent article (20) according to claim 5 wherein said user's region
(75) and said manufacturer's region (74) are continuous, said user's region (75) and said

manufacturer's region (74) being continuous and having a continuous adhesive layer,
said manufacturer's region (74) being secured to said outside surface (46) of said

absorbent article (20) by said continuous adhesive layer.
Disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of the preceding claims
wherein said mechanical fastening member (62) comprises hook type engaging means

and said mechanical fastening landing member comprises loop type engaging means to
engage with said hook type engaging means during use of said absorbent article (20).
Disposable absorbent article (20) according to any of the preceding claims
wherein said mechanical fastening landing member (64) is joined to said outside surface

(46) of said absorbent article (20) by an adhesive and said mechanical fastening landing
member (64) is provided as a unitary piece.
