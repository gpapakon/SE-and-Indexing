<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical overload relays and more
specifically, to a solid state, multiple phase overload relay.Overload relays are electrical switches typically employed in
industrial settings to protect electrical equipment from damage due to
overheating in turn caused by excessive current flow, In a typical case, the
electoical equipment is a three-phase motor which is connected to a power
source through another relay commonly referred to as a contactor. The
contactor is controlled by another switch which is typically remotely located.In a conventional setup, an overload relay is connected in series with
the control switch for, in turn, control of the contactor. When an overload
condition is detected by the overload relay, the overload relay operates the
switch which, in turn, de-energizes the contactor which cuts the source of
power to the electrical equipment, thereby preventing damage to the
equipment.In the past, overload relays have utilized resistive heaters for each
phase which are in heat transfer relation with a bimetal element, which in
turn controls a switch. When an overload is sensed, as, for example, when
there is sufficient heat input from the resistive heater to the bimetal element,
the bimetal element opens its associated switch to de-energize the contactor
coil and disconnect the associated piece of electrical equipment from the
source of power.US-A-4 876 622 discloses a circuit breaker warning and control relay
device which provides a visual indication of an impending overcurrent 
condition. Sufficient time is allotted for manual intervention to prevent
damage to equipment connected to the device prior to the activation of the
circuit breaker. The relay can be arranged to automatically shut-down
selected equipment in a predetermined order to implement load-shedding.More recently, the resistive heater-bimetal element type of relay has
been supplanted by electrical overload relays. One such relay is disclosed in
commonly assigned US-A-5 179 495 (EP-A-0 469 207). A self-powered
multiple phase circuit protection device including a plurality of current
transformers connected to and parallel with one another are adapted to be
individually associated with one phase of a multiple phase load. The current
transformers provide signals representing the current flowing in its associated
phase. A switch is actuated to interrupt power to the load in response a fault
signal generated by a fault determining circuit when a predetermined
condition, for example, loss of phase, is detected.
