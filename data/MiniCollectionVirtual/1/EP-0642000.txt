<ABSTRACT>
A method is described which enables drift elimination in sensors, whose sensitivity 
to a quantity 
S
 depends on their relative orientation to the medium 
in which 
S
 is measured. The method obtains each drift-free measurement as 
the difference of the results of two successive measurements, said two successive 

measurements being obtained with two different relative orientations 
between sensor and medium, said relative orientations being associated with 

two distinct sensitivities to 
S
. This 
Alternating Direction Method
 applies in 
particular to flow sensors, and enables accurate long-time volume measurement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention provides a method for the elimination of drift in vector
sensors. To set notation, a vector sensor is understood to be measuring a
physical vectorial quantity S in an input energy domain Di by converting S
into a signal in an output energy domain Do. In particular, we think here
of electric or electronic sensors for the measurement of gas flow or pressure.
Thus, sensors are seen to simultaneously possess a state A in the input energy
domain Di and a state B in the output energy domain Do.The new method of operation concerns the real-world application of sensors
in the presence of imperfections. Imperfections are generally present in
both the sensor itself and, in the case of active sensors, in the biasing of
the sensor and its output amplifiers. While ideal sensors as abstract devices
possess zero sensitivity for physical quantities other than S, sensors in the
real-world possess imperfections due to technological limitations and, consequently,
possess finite sensitivity for quantities other than S. Errors in the
measurement of S due to finite sensitivity to quantities other than S are
manifested in the form of offset with unpredictable behavior. The resulting
drift in offset persists additively as drift in the output signal, when the input
signal, S, is kept constant. Typically, the resulting offset is predominant
over noise, i.e., S/offset << S/noise, so that offset defines the lowest limit at
which S can be reliably measured. In other words, offset typically determines
the dynamic range of the sensor at hand, rather than noise. We remark that 
drift in the sensitivity of a sensor to its measurand S does not influence the
dynamic range of the sensor. For this reason, only the forementioned drift
in offset, i.e., additive drift is considered here.The current approach towards elimination of drift is taken by a continuous
effort towards ever more precise manufacturing processes. In particular,
modern manufacturing processes involve special correction techniques such as
laser trimming, with which imperfections resulting from the basic production
process are greatly reduced. In such approach, the final performance of the
sensor is determined by the quality of the overall production process. With
our new method, proposed below, technological limitations are of secondary
importance.The new method is proposed for elimination of drift. The method applies
to sensors with directional sensitivity, i.e., anisotropic sensitivity in two
or more directions. Sensors of this type are also known as vector
