Mixer and compressed-air conveyor, in particular for 
mortar or concrete by way of material to be mixed and 

conveyed, with a mixing vessel that is capable of being 
charged with the material to be mixed and conveyed, said 

mixing vessel being connected to a conveyor line (12), 
including a motor-driven stirring mechanism (14) and 

being capable of being pressurised with compressed air 
(16,46), further with a drive motor (20) and a screw 

compressor (32) that is capable of being driven by the 
drive motor for generating the compressed air, wherein 

the stirring mechanism (14) is capable of being driven by 
means of a hydraulic motor (30) that is capable of being 

pressurised with pressure oil by way of at least one 
hydraulic pump (24,26) driven by the drive motor (20) and 

is arranged together with said drive motor in a hydraulic 
circuit including an oil tank (38), an oil cooler (50) 

and an oil filter (52), and wherein the screw compressor 
(32) is arranged in a lubricating and cooling-oil circuit 

including an oil/air container (34) with air separator 
(36) and oil sump (38), an oil cooler (50) and an oil 

filter (52)
, characterised in that
 the hydraulic circuit 
(24,26,28,30) of the drive of the stirring mechanism and 

the lubricating and cooling-oil circuit of the screw 
compressor (32) have a common oil tank constituted by the 

oil sump (38) of the oil/air container (34). 
Mixer and compressed-air conveyor according to Claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the hydraulic circuit (24,26,28,30) 
of the drive of the stirring mechanism and the 

lubricating and cooling-oil circuit of the screw 
compressor (32) have a common oil cooler (50) and/or oil 

filter (52).  
 
Mixer and compressed-air conveyor according to Claim 1 or 
2, 
characterised in that
 the hydraulic pump (24,26) of 
the drive of the stirring mechanism is capable of being 

pressurised on the suction side, directly or via a 
precompressor pump (56), with oil from the oil sump (38) 

of the oil/air container of the screw compressor (32). 
Mixer and compressed-air conveyor according to Claim 3, 

characterised in that
 the precompressor pump (56) 
comprises a
n air separator with a compressed-air line 
(58) that is recirculated into the oil/air container 

(34). 
Mixer and compressed-air conveyor according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the hydraulic motor 
(30) of the drive of the stirring mechanism is connected 

on the reflux side to the lubricating and cooling-oil 
inlet of the screw compressor (32) via the oil cooler 

(50) and the oil filter (52). 
Mixer and compressed-air conveyor according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the hydraulic motor 
(30) of the drive of the stirring mechanism leads on the 

reflux side, directly or indirectly via the oil cooler 
(50) and/or the oil filter (52), into the oil/air 

container (34) and in that the screw compressor (32) is 
capable of being pressurised, directly or indirectly via 

an additional oil cooler and/or oil filter, with 
lubricating and cooling oil from the oil sump (38) of the 

oil/air container (34). 
Mixer and conveyor according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the oil sump (38) of the oil/air 
container (34) is partitioned into an input zone (60) 

with gas-laden oil and an output zone (62) with degassed 
oil.  

 
Mixer and conveyor according to Claim 7, 
characterised in 
that
 the input zone (60) and the output zone (62) are 
separated from one another, in a manner so as to allow 

liquid to pass, by an air-separation screen (64) immersed 
in the oil sump or by an appropriate bulkhead.
