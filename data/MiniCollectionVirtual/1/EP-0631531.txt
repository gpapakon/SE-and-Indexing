<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flexible abrasive products having a 
resinous binder which bonds abrasive grains to a substrate which has improved 
performance under dry and wet grinding conditions and at high temperatures. Flexible abrasive articles include coated abrasives, lapping 
abrasives, and nonwoven abrasives. In the case of a coated abrasive the 
substrate is a backing sheet. In the case of a nonwoven abrasive the substrate is 
a flexible open lofty porous web. In the case of lapping abrasives, the substrate 
is a backing. Coated abrasives generally comprise a flexible backing sheet 
upon which a binder holds and supports a coating of abrasive grains. The 
coated abrasive may employ a "make" coat of resinous binder material in order 
to secure the abrasive grains to the backing as the grains are oriented, and a 
"size" coat of resinous binder material which can be applied over the make coat 
and abrasive grains in order to firmly bond the abrasive grains to the backing. 
The binder material of the size coat can be the same material as the binder 
material of the make coat or a different material. In the manufacture of coated abrasives, the make coat and 
abrasive grains are first applied to the backing, then the size coat is applied, 
and finally, the construction is fully cured. Generally thermally curable binders 
provide coated abrasives with excellent properties, e.g., heat resistance. 
Thermally curable binders include phenolic resins, urea-formaldehyde resins, 
urethane resins, melamine-formaldehyde resins, epoxy resins, and alkyd resins. 
The most widely used binder is a resol phenolic resin. In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for 
superabrasives both in the flexible and bonded abrasive markets. 
Superabrasives are abrasive articles that employ abrasive grains that are 
superior in performance, i.e., greater than 20 times that of conventional 
abrasive grains in abrading difficult to grind materials such as tool steels or 
ceramics. Superabrasive grains are typically diamond or cubic boron nitride 
and these abrasive grains typically cost in excess of one thousand dollars per 
pound. Conventional abrasive grains include garnet, silicon carbide, silica,  
 
aluminum oxide, alumina zirconia, boron carbide, and ceramic aluminum 
oxide. Conventional abrasive grains are typically less than ten dollars per 
pound. For bonded abrasives, if superabrasive grains are employed, the 
binders can be vitreous, organic, or metallic (plated or sintered). While each 
binder type has a
