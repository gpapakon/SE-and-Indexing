<ABSTRACT>
A synchronizing system 
accomplishes synchronous reproduction 

for video and audio signals 
The number of unit audio data blocks to be 

put in one pack is set in such a way that the difference 
between the presentation start times for the stream of 

video data and the stream of audio data in one pack in a 
predetermined pack period becomes a predetermined value, 

and the pack carries positional information of the pack in 
the predetermined pack period to the pack. In a reproducing 

apparatus, the difference between presentation start times 
for video signals and audio signals in each pack is 

acquired by referring to positional information (AAU 
sequence number) in a stream of packs, transferred by the 

above transmission method, and at least one of the 
presentation start times for video signals and audio 

signals in the stream of packs is controlled so that the 
difference between the presentation start times coincides 

with the difference between the presentation start times 
corresponding to the positional information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synchronizing
system which reproduces a video signal and an audio signal
synchronously in a system that transfers coded video and
audio signals in time-division multiplexing.As a method of recording, reproducing or transferring
compressed and coded video and audio signals and other data
in time-division multiplexing, there is MPEG (Motion
Picture coding Experts Group) which conforms to ISO 11172.The compressive coding of video signals in this scheme
employs predictive coding in combination with motion
compensation, and discrete cosine transform (DCT).The method described in the ISO 11172 requires that a
counter having many bits should be provided in the
reproducing apparatus, and that decoding timing should be
so controlled as to start the presentation of decoded data
as a video image or voices and sound when the value of the
counter coincides with the presentation time stamp (PTS).
The control circuit therefore becomes complicated.In EP-A-0,598,295 there is described a video and audio
signal multiplexing and separating apparatus including a
buffer memory for time axis adjustment of the audio signal. The number of audio signals in a buffer memory is kept
constant by detection of samples different from a specified
value. This allows effective use of the buffer memory
capacity.In Signal Processing Image Communication, vol 4, No.2,
April 92, pp 153-159, there is described a specification for
MPEG systems coding for compressed digital video and audio
signals.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a synchronizing system with a simple structure,
which can accomplish synchronous reproduction without
complicating a control circuit for synchronizing video and
audio signals with each other.To achieve the above object, according to one aspect
of this invention, there is provided a method of
transmitting time-divided video and audio signals,
comprising the steps of;
coding a predetermined time slot (GOP) of video signals
to form a stream of video data:coding a predetermined number of samples of audio
signals to form a unit audio data block and forming a stream
of audio data consisting of an integer number of unit audio
data blocks whose aggregate time slot approximately
corresponds to said predetermined time slot;performing time-division multiplexing on said stream of
video data (GOP) and said stream of audio data, storing
resultant data in a pack (VD,AP) having said predetermined
time slot (GOP) and transferring the video signals and audio 
signals in pack
