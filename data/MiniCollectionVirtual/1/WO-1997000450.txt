<ABSTRACT>
To interrupt the current to the drive motor (3) of a motor-driven arm (1) which carries a pipette (2) when something or someone unintentionally contacts the pipette (2) during its movement, the arm (1) has a lower, rigid part (5), and an upper, flexible part (6) which, at its one end, carries the pipette (2) and, at its other end, is rigidly connected to the lower arm part (5). The upper, flexible part (6) is in releasable contact with the lower, rigid part (5) at the end that carries the pipette (2), and is adapted to, at least partially, the released from that contact when something or someone unintentionally contacts the pipette (2) during its movement. A detecting means (9) is adapted to detect when the upper, flexible part (6), at least partially, is released from the contact with the lower, rigid part (5) and in response hereto cause a switch to brake the current to the drive motor (3) for the arm (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
 SAFETY DEVICE FOR A PIPETTE ARMTECHNICAL FIELDThe invention relates to a safety device for a motor-driven arm which carries a pipette.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn e.g. automatic medical analysis instruments where a pipette arm moves a pipette at great speed between a large number of test tubes, requirements have been set up stating that the pipette must not to cause personal injuries upon an unintentional contact with the pipette during operation.One way of accomplishing this is to completely protect the area within which the pipette moves from contact by enclosing it in a protective housing.Since there is a need of inserting or removing test tubes during operation of the pipette, the solution with a protective housing is not satisfactory.BRIEF DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONTherefore, the object of the invention is to bring about a safety device which automatically interrupts the operation of the pipette arm as soon as something or someone unintentionally contacts the pipette during its movement.This is attained by means of the safety device mentioned in the introduction in that the arm has a lower, rigid part, and an upper, flexible part which, at its one end, carries the pipette and, at its other end, is rigidly connected to the lower arm part, that the upper, flexible part is in releasable contact with the lower, rigid part at the end that carries the pipette, and is adapted to, at least partially, be released from that contact when something or someone unintentionally contacts the pipette during its movement, and that detecting means are provided to detect when the upper, flexible part, at least partially, is released from the contact with the lower, rigid part and in response hereto 

cause a switch to break the current to the drive motor for the arm.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The invention will be described more in detail below with reference to the appended drawing on which the single figure schematically shows a longitudinal section of an embodiment of a pipette arm according to the invention.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS1 generally denotes an arm which carries a pipette 2 and which, in the embodiment shown, is driven by a motor 3 on whose shaft 4 the pipette arm 1 is fixed in a manner not shown in any greater detail.In the embodiment shown, the pipette 2 will thus be moved around the shaft 4. However, the invention is not restricted to the embodiment shown, but is applicable also to pipette arms which are driven in another manner than around a driving shaft.In accordance with the

CLAIMS
1. Safety device for a motor-driven arm (1) which carries a pipette (2) , characterized in - that the arm (1) has a lower, rigid part (5) , and an upper, flexible part (6) , which, at its one end, carries the pipette (2) and, at its other end, is rigidly connected to the lower arm part (5) , - that the upper, flexible part (6) is in releasable contact with the lower, rigid part (5) at the end that carries the pipette (2) , and is adapted to, at least partially, be released from that contact when something or someone unintentionally contacts the pipette (2) during its movement, and - that a detecting means (9) is provided to detect when the upper, flexible part (6) is, at least partially, released from the contact with the lower, rigid part (5) and in response hereto cause a switch to break the current to the drive motor (3) for the arm (1) .
2. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the upper, flexible part (6) is a leaf spring.
3. Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the upper, flexible part (6) and the lower, rigid part (5) are magnetically interconnected to accomplish said releasable contact between those parts.
4. Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the lower, rigid part (5) and the upper, flexible part (6) are magnetic.
5. Device according to claim 4, characterized in that a permanent magnet (8) is affixed to the lower, rigid part (5) of non-magnetic material, while the upper, flexible part (6) is of magnetic material.
6. Device according to any of claims 1-5, characterized in that the detecting means (9) comprises a light source which 


is adapted to illuminate a light reflective lug (10) on the upper, flexible part (6) , and a light sensor which is adapted to detect light reflected by the lug (10) and on its output emit a signal upon a change of the strength of the reflected light in connection with a movement of the lug (10) when the upper, flexible part (6) , at least partially, is released from the contact with the lower, rigid part (5) , the output of the light sensor being connected to a control input of said switch to interrupt the current to the drive motor (3) for the arm (1) .
7. Device according to claim 6, characterized in that said light source and said light sensor are provided on said lower, rigid part (5) , and that said lug (10) extends from the upper, flexible part (6) through an opening in the lower, rigid part (5) .
