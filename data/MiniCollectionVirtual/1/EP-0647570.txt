<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a dispensing container (1) which is easy to produce, is environmentally friendly and is made of cardboard for a roll (2) of a film material and for separating and delivering an unwound piece of film (14) by means of a tearing-off strip (3), which container also makes easy handling possible. The tearing-off strip (3) of the dispensing container (1) according to the invention consists of cardboard material, the tearing-off edge of the tearing-off strip consists of a multiplicity of adjacently arranged teeth (8) in the plane of the tearing-off strip, which are arranged within or outside the tearing-off edge. The tearing-off strip is attached to the dispensing container as a separate part or is bonded thereto. In this case, the tearing-off strip has a decreasing thickness and an increasing density towards the tearing-off edge. The dispensing container can also comprise a counter-strip with counter-teeth so that, when the dispensing container is closed, teeth and counter-teeth engage in one another, and a smooth, continuous outer side is thus provided in the region of the tearing-off strip.
