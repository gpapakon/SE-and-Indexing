<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for public switched networks, preferably public telephone 
networks, in which mobile subscribers (MT1-MTw) and stationary subscribers 

(STa-STn) have access to at least one exchange (SC), with both the mobile and 
also the stationary subscribers (MT1-MTw; STa-STn) each being assigned an 

individual identification, with which identification the subscriber answers 
(identification signal) and is thus identified and located by the exchange (SC), 

whereafter, in the event of a call request, for the establishment of a connection 
from the subscriber to the exchange (SC) or vice versa, a communication-channel 

pair is assigned to the subscriber (MT1-MTw) by the exchange (SC), with the 
access of the stationary subscribers (STa-STn) being by means of at least one 

broad-band cable (K1), preferably a fibre-optic cable, said broad-band cable (K1) 
extending directly to the subscribers and extending from the exchange (SC) to the 

stationary-subscriber terminals (STa-STn) without call-processing function and 
without the intermediate connection of subscriber-specific wires and through 

which cables there is the same signalling (identification signal), channel 
assignment (communication-channel pair) and message transmission such that 

each subscriber, irrespective of whether mobile or stationary, is reached 
functionally in identical manner by the exchange (SC) through a communication-channel 

pair, characterized in that
 
additionally connected to the broad-band cable (K1), apart from the stationary 

subscribers (STa-STn), are radio base stations (BSF1-BSFn,BSFx-BSFz) of the 
mobile subscribers (MT1-MTw), said radio base stations (BSF1-BSFn,BSFx-BSFz) 

likewise having access, functionally in identical manner to the stationary 
subscribers (STa-STn), to all communication-channel pairs made available by the 

exchange (SC) through the broad-band cable (K1), with the radio base stations 
(BSF1-BSFz) each being connected to the broad-band cable (K1) through the 

intermediary of radio-base-station terminals (FE1-FEz), said radio-base-station 
terminals (FE1-FEz) converting the respective communication-channel pair to the 

radio-frequency range (FS1-FSz) of the radio base station (BSF1-BSFz) in 
question, with a common transmission element (BSK1) with a frequency 

coverage being connected before the broad-band cable (K1), said common 
transmission element (BSK1) converting the communication-channel pairs made 

available in the exchange (SC) to cable-frequency spectrum (KFS)  
 

encompassing all communication-channel pairs both of the stationary (STa-STn) 
and also of the mobile subscribers (MT1-MTw), and vice versa. 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that a plurality of 
groups of radio base stations (BSF1-BSFn, BSFx-BSFz) is connected to the 

broad-band cable (K1), the radio channels of said radio base stations (BSF1-BSFn, 
BSFx-BSFz) each being situated in different frequency bands (radio-frequency 

layers Fa-Fd). 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the exchange 
(SC) is assigned a control apparatus (S), with - out of the radio channels available 

to a group of radio base stations (e.g. BSF1-BSFn), said radio channels being 
transmitted through the intermediary of transmitting/receiving apparatuses (S/E) 

provided in said radio base stations (BSF1-BSFn) - selected radio channels each 
being assigned by said control apparatus (S) to a radio base station (BSF1-BSn), 

with said control apparatus (S) storing said assignment with regard to the number 
and respective frequency position of the individual radio channels and fixing said 

assignment in optionally variable manner in each radio base station (BSF1-BSFn) 
by activation of the relevant transmitting/receiving apparatuses (S/E). 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 3, characterized in that the control 
apparatus (S) comprises a traffic-measuring apparatus (VM), said traffic-measuring 

apparatus (VM) determining the instantaneous traffic load on a group 
of radio base stations (e.g. BSF1-BSFn) and communicating to the control 

apparatus (S) the load signals representing the traffic load, with the control 
apparatus (S), in assigning the individual radio channels, taking account of the 

geographical location of said radio base stations (BSF1-BSFn) by logically 
combining the load signals with interference indicators, said interference 

indicators indicating mutually interfering radio channels. 
Circuit arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
the mobile subscribers (MT1-MTw) and the stationary subscribers (STa-STn) are 

provided with uniform subscriber terminals.
