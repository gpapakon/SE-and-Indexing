feature vector extractor to extract a feature vector of 

an input pattern; a converting unit to convert the 
feature vector extracted by the feature vector 

extractor into the feature vector which is effective 
for selection between categories; a classification 

processing unit for calculating an inner product with a 
predetermined basic vector for the converted vector 

after the conversion was performed by the converting 
unit; and a category selecting unit for selecting and 

outputting a category group to which the input pattern 
belongs with reference to a predetermined category 

table on the basis of the result of the calculation by 
the classification processing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pattern
recognition apparatus and method having a
function such that for an unknown input vector, by
outputting a group of categories to which the input
vector belongs, the number of candidate categories to
which the input vector belongs can be reduced.In a conventional pattern recognition apparatus,
in the case where the number of categories as targets
for recognition is very large, for an input vector, it
is not compared with all of the standard patterns as
candidates but there are executed processes such that a
predetermined arithmetic operation of a small amount of
calculations is executed first and a group of
categories which can be determined such that the input
vector belongs to such a category group are selected
with reference to a table in accordance with the values
of the results of the arithmetic operations and the
categories included in the category group are output as
candidates. Such processes are generally called a
narrow-down or classification of the candidates. Since 
the number of candidate categories is reduced by such a
classification process, the whole processing time can
be reduced. Examples of such a classification will now
be described in detail hereinbelow. Fig. 8 shows a
construction of a conventional apparatus for
recognizing characters. In the diagram, reference
numeral 71 denotes an input unit for converting a
document image as a target for recognition into an
electric signal; 72 a feature extractor for extracting
a feature that is peculiar to a character from an input
signal from the input unit 71 every character and for
producing a feature vector; 75 to 78 portions to
execute a classification process; 76 a parameter memory
in which parameters for the classification process have
been stored; 75 a classification processing unit; 78 a
category table; 77 a category table reference unit for
referring to the category table 78 from the result of
the classification process; 80 a dictionary in which
standard patterns of all of the candidate categories as
targets for recognition have been stored as mean
vectors; 79 a comparator for selecting the category, as
a recognition result, which gives the smallest distance
between the standard vector in the dictionary 80 and
the input vector; and 81 an output unit for outputting
the candidate category which was finally selected by
the comparator 79.It is an object of the classification to reduce 
the number of categories which can become the
candidates by a small calculation amount as small as
possible.
