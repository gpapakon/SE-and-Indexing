<ABSTRACT>
A system (30) for packing data into a video processor is provided. 
System (30) comprises demultiplexer (32), first and second first in-first out 

buffer memories (34) and (36), and multiplexer (38). Demultiplexer (32) 
divides a field of video data into first and second parts (42) and (44). First 

and second parts (42) and (44) are stored in first first in-first out buffer 
memories (34) and (36), respectively. Multiplexer (38) combines one line 

from first first in-first out buffer memory (34) with one line from second first 
in-first out buffer memory (36) to form a single line for processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of electronic devices.
More particularly, this invention relates to a system and method for packing
data into a video processor.Video signals may be processed using known devices. The video
signals may be processed for various different applications. One known video
processor is the Scanline Video Processor produced by TEXAS
INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED. This video processor operates on one
line of video signal at a time. The video processor has a plurality of
processing elements. The number of pixels that may be processed at one time
is limited by the number of processing elements.A recursive video signal processor for estimating motion
vectors, which demultiplexes an incoming high definition
video signal into four adjacent quadrants, which are each
processed by four separate motion estimators, is known from
EP-A-0 554 586. The division of a high definition television
field into four quadrants allows use of normal definition
television systems. This document reports that adjacent
quadrants preferably show a partial overlap.A method for packing data in a processor, wherein parallel
reading is performed to shorten processing time, is known
from Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 14, No. 574 (P-1145),
December 20, 1990 and JP-A-02247637. A stimulable phosphor
sheet arranged at equal intervals with three pairs of a
reading unit is fixed on an X stage and shifted in one
direction. The reading unit scans each divided stimulable
phosphor sheet region, and read image data are stored in
frame memories. An image processor reads the image data from
the frame memories sequentially through a multiplexer,
receives the data as the read image data by one piece of the
stimulable phosphor sheet and processing is performed.In a typical processing application, the number of pixels in one line of
video signal is less than the number of processing elements of the video
processor. Therefore, the video processor is not efficiently used.In accordance with the present invention, a system for packing data
into a video processor is disclosed that substantially eliminates or reduces
disadvantages and problems associated with prior systems.More specifically, the present invention provides a system for packing
data in a video processor. The system comprises
the features defined in claim 1.  The present invention further provides a method for packing video data
in a video processor comprising the steps defined in claim 4.It is a technical advantage of the present invention to provide a system

<CLAIMS>
A system for packing data in a video processor, said
processor being capable of performing operations

simultaneously on N pixels of data, said system comprising:

a line slicer (14) for separating an image field into
overlapping M-pixel-wide vertical strips of pixels, wherein

M is less than or equal to N/2;
first and second memories (34, 36), each operable to
store multiple segments of video data, each segment

comprising one line of video data from one of said vertical
strips;
a demultiplexer (32) receiving said segments, said
demultiplexer (32) being operable to store a first contiguous

group of said segments in said first memory (34), a second
contiguous group of said segments in said second memory

(36), and a third contiguous group adjacent to said first
and second contiguous groups in both said first and said

second memories (34, 36);
a multiplexer (38) receiving said segments of video
data from said memories (34, 36) and operable to combine one

segment of video data from each memory (34, 36) into a
single segment of video data for processing by said video

processor (40), wherein said single combined segment
contains data for no more than N pixels.
The system of claim 1, wherein said first and said second
memories (34, 36) are first and second buffer memories.
The system of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said first and
said second memories (34, 36) are first and second first in-first

out memories.
A method for packing video data in a video processor,
comprising the steps of:


storing a plurality of video data segments in a
plurality of memories (34, 36), each video data segment

representing a horizontal group of video pixels, the step of
storing comprising the step of storing video data segments

from a first image region in a first said memory (34), video
data segments from a second image region abutting said first

image region in said first memory (34) and a second memory
(36), and video data segments from a third region abutting

said second region in said second memory;
combining one video data segment stored in each memory
(34, 36) to form a data word for processing by the video

processor (40); and
communicating the combined data word to the video
processor (40).
The method of claim 4, wherein the step of storing a
plurality of video data segments comprises the step of

storing a first plurality of video data segments comprising

approximately the top half of a video field and storing a
second plurality of video data segments comprising

approximately the bottom half of a video field.
