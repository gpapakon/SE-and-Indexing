<ABSTRACT>
A tubing management system (10) is provided for use with surgical instrumentation requiring irrigation and aspiration of fluids and a peristaltic pump (14). The tubing management system includes a housing (42) and a manifold (66) for connecting a transfer tube with aspiration (24) and irrigation (22) lines from the surgical instrumentation (16) and with waste (38) and supply (32) lines. An opening in the housing (42) enables access to the transfer tube in order to control fluid flow therein. A diaphragm (74) mounted to the housing and in fluid communication with the aspiration tube (58) enables pressure measurement in the tubing when the housing (42) is inserted into a drawer (44) in the console (12) and in operative engagement with a peristaltic pump head (14) disposed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
irrigation/aspiration apparatus for surgical procedures
and more particularly relates to the tubing
management system for use with a surgical instrument
for endophthalmic surgery.The removal of cataracts, for example, involves
surgery on a normally pressurized eye in which instruments
are passed through a small incision at the edge
of the cornea in order to access and remove opaque
cataract material.The cataracts may be fragmentized by cutting
apparatus, vibratory apparatus, or the like, and the
fragments are aspirated from the eye.In order to maintain normal pressure within the
eye, a balanced salt solution is supplied from an
elevated chamber, the chamber being elevated to a
position to provide proper head, or pressure.The irrigation and aspiration of fluid through
the eye must be carefully monitored in order to
maintain normal pressure within the eye during
surgical procedures. An underpressure may cause
distortion of the eye which often may interfere with
surgical procedures. Over pressure may cause damage to
the eye and in extreme cases, rupture thereof.As it has been hereinabove noted, pressure in the
eye may be controlled by the physical elevation of the
chamber of balanced salt solution, which is connected
to the surgical instrument. Aspiration fluid, on the 
other hand, is controlled in the eye with a peristaltic
pump.Typical apparatus includes an instrument console for
controlling the flow of fluids.
One such apparatus is disclosed in US-A-4 168 707. Various devices have
been developed for the coordinated flow of fluids and
some include a phacocassette tubing and management
system, which may be disposable or autoclavable, for
interconnecting from the various tubes and lines for
proper irrigation and aspiration.A general discussion of the advantages of this
type of cassette is set forth in U.S. Patent No.
4,713,051.Cassettes, such as those described in U.S. Patent
No. 4,713,051, provide means for housing a portion of
each of the irrigation and aspiration tubing, together
with a drain bag structured so that all fluid
connections are precisely made to the eguipment by
insertion of the cassette into a console. Thus, the
reliability of the fluid connections is enhanced.While the prior art devices, such as the one
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,713,051, provide a
significant step forward in the art of tube management,
these devices do not provide full cooperation with a
surgical instrument utilizing irrigation and aspiraton
lines.For example, during

<CLAIMS>
A tubing management system (10) for use with surgical
instrumentation (16) requiring irrigation and aspiration of

fluids and a peristaltic pump (14), said management system
comprising:


a housing (42) comprising means for both supporting an
aspiration tube (58) and enabling access thereto for

contact with a peristaltic pump head and or connecting
said aspiration tube (58) with an aspiration line (24) of

a surgical device (16);
means (66,92,94) for connecting a sane solution line
(32) to both the aspiration line (24) and an irrigation

line (22) of the surgical device;
means (100,104,114,116,120,122) or enabling the
regulation of irrigation fluid flow in said saline solution

line (32) into both said irrigation (22) and said
aspiration (24) lines of the surgical device (16);
diaphragm means (74), disposed in said housing
(42), and in fluid communication with said aspiration tube (58),

for enabling pressure measurement in said aspiration tube
(58); and
ferromagnetic means (154) for removably coupling said
diaphragm means (74) to an external transducer.
The tubing management system according to claim 1 wherein 
said means for enabling the regulation of irrigation fluid

flow comprises transfer tubes 100, 104 interconnecting said
saline solution line (32) with both said irrigation (22)

and aspiration (24) lines and means, defining openings
(114, 116) in said housing, for enabling access to the

transfer tubes (100,104)
The tubing management system according to claim 2 wherein
said means for enabling access to the transfer tubes (100,104)

further comprises bridge means (120,122), spanning each
opening (114,116), for enabling the transfer tubes (100,104) to be

compressed thereagainst in order to regulate fluid flow
therein.
A tubing management system according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein the housing (42) comprises manifold

means (66), removably attached to the housing (42), for
connecting transfer tubes (100,104) with the aspiration

(24) and irrigation (22) lines.
The tubing management system according to claim 4 wherein
the manifold connects the transfer tubes (100,104) with the

aspiration (24) and irrigation (22) lines and with waste
(38) and saline solution (32) lines.
The tubing management system according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein the housing (42) is adapted for

insertion into a drawer (44) in an instrument console 
(12), the instrument console (12) having a peristaltic pump

head (14), the housing (42) enabling operational contact
between the peristaltic pump head (14) and the aspiration

tube (58) when the housing (42) is inserted into the
instrument console opening (44).
