<ABSTRACT>
A non-volatile semiconductor memory device includes NAND 
type memory cells arranged in a matrix pattern over a 

semiconductor substrate and channel stopper layers, provided 
on the substrate, for separating adjacent NAND type memory 

cells. Each NAND type memory cell includes memory cell 
transistors having drains and sources mutually connected in 

series, a source side select transistor connected to a source 
of one end transistor of the memory cell transistors, and a 

drain side select transistor connected to a drain of the other 
end transistor of the memory cell transistors. Each channel 

stopper layer has a first layer portion for separating the 
source side select transistors and a second layer portion for 

separating the memory cell transistors. Impurity 
concentration of the first layer portion is lower than that 

of the second layer portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-volatile 
semiconductor memory device, and more specifically to a NAND 
type non-volatile semiconductor memory device having a memory 
cell array in which NAND type memory cells are arranged in a 
matrix pattern. Recently, there is a great demand for non-volatile 
semiconductor memory devices, because data are not erased even 
if the voltage supply is turned off. In the case of flash 
memory as a simultaneous erasable non-volatile semiconductor 
memory device, it is possible to construct the memory cell by 
a single transistor, being different from two-transistor bite-type 
non-volatile semiconductor memory device in which data 
can be erased per bite. Among these, in the NAND type EEPROM 
(electrically erasable and programmable read only memory), 
since the number of bit line contacts per unit cell can be 
reduced markedly, it is possible to realize a high density 
memory cell array. As a result, since the memory cell size 
can be reduced effectively, the NAND type EEPROM is expected 
as a use of a substitute for a large capacity magnetic disk. In the NAND type EEPROM, the memory cell array is 
constructed by arranging NAND type memory cells in a matrix 
pattern. Here, the memory cells are composed of series cells 
formed by connecting memory cell transistors (MOS transistors 
each having a floating gate) in series, source side select 
transistors each having a gate connected to a source side 
select line provided between one end of the series-connected 
memory cells and a common source line, and drain side select 
transistors provided between the other end of the series 
connected memory cells and the bit lines. Such a NAND type EEPROM is known from DE-A-4 005 645, for example. In operation, when charges are accumulated at the  
 
floating gates of the respective memory cell transistors, 
since the threshold values of the MOS transistors change, 
information data can be stored on the basis of change in the 
threshold value. Further, information data can be written 
and erased in and from the memory cells by flowing a tunnel 
current through an insulating film. In the NAND type EEPROM as described above, however, 
since a relatively high voltage (e.g., 20 V) is used to write 
and erase data, it is necessary to suppress leak current from 
flowing between the adjacent memory cells as much as possible, 
so that the impurity concentration is determined to be 
relatively high in a channel stopper layer under a field 
insulating film used as the element separating
