<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of certain
halogenated hydrocarbon solvents.US-A 3 381 042 discloses a process for preparing 1,1-dichloro-2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropane
(R225ca).US-A 2 462 402 discloses a reaction which is believed to
produce 1,3-dichloro-1,2,2,3,3-pentafluoropropane (R225cb).Research disclosure No. 146, June 1976, pages 13 to 14
discloses the use of 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane as
displacement drying fluid for spot-free drying of water-wet
manufactured items.1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (hereinafter
referred to simply as R113) is non-flammable, non-explosive
and stable with low toxicity and as such, is
widely used as a cleaning agent for a flux employed in
the assembling process of electronic parts or precision
machine parts or for cutting oils, or as a cleaning agent
for clothings such as fur coats or suits. Further, R113
is widely used for removing deposited water after the
washing treatment with water of liquid crystal display
device parts, electronic parts or precision machine
parts. On the other hand, a rinsing agent such as
trichloroethylene is used to remove a resist-removing
agent deposited on a wafer. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane is
used as a cleaning agent to remove a buffing agent
deposited on precision metal parts or decorative parts 
after the buffing treatment thereof. Further, 1,1,1-trichloroethane
is used for developing a resist in the
preparation of a printed circuit board or a semiconductor
circuit, and methylene chloride or perchloroethylene is
used for removing the resist after etching treatment. In spite of its various merits, R113 has been found
to destroy ozone in the stratosphere, which in turn
brings about a skin cancer. On the other hand, methylene
chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane
are likely to bring about a pollution of
underground water, and it is required to minimize the
amount of their use.Under these circumstances, it is an object of the
present invention to solve such problems and to provide a use of a
halogenated hydrocarbon solvent as a substitute for
the conventional solvents.The present invention provides a use of a compound of CF3 CF2 CHCl2 or CClF2 CF2 CHClF for removing deposited water.Now, the present invention will be described in
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. The compounds of the present invention
may be used alone or in combination as a
mixture. They are useful as a solvent for removing
deposited water.When the compounds of the present invention are
employed for the
