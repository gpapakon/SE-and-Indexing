<ABSTRACT>
A toy character comprising a main body section (1) 
mounted on 3 wheels (2,3,4). The axle (5) joining the rear 

wheels (2,3) is mounted to at least one of the wheels at a 
position radially offset from the centre of the wheel. 

This causes the toy the roll from side to side as it is 
pulled along. Head (11) and tail (12) members are 

rotatably mounted to the body (1), and fins (23-25) loosely 
fit into slots (29-31) in the top of the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toy character, 
mounted on wheels, which may be pulled along by a child. In accordance with the present invention, a toy 
character comprises a main body section, two circular 
wheels joined by an axle journaled to the main body 
section, wherein the axle is attached to at least one wheel 
at a position radially offset from the centre of the wheel. As a toy character according to the invention is 
pulled along by a child, the main body section will 
oscillate from side to side. One or preferably both wheels 
may be radially offset from the axle. Where both wheels 
are offset, the centres of the wheels may be offset by 
different amounts. The wheels may be offset in the same 
direction or may be angularly displaced. Preferably, the 
centres of each wheel are offset from the axle at an equal 
distance from the other wheel, and are angularly displaced 
by 180°, i.e. each wheel is offset from the axle an equal 
distance and in an opposite direction from the other wheel. 
This ensures that the main body section tilts evenly on 
each side. The character may be pulled along and supported on 
only two wheels with a third point of support being lifted 
in the air during movement, and supporting the character 
when it is at rest. Alternatively, the third point of 
support may slide along a surface as the character is 
pulled along. Preferably, the main body section includes 
a front wheel which allows the character to roll along a 
surface unsupported. The character may have a head, tail, fins or other 
projections integrally formed with the main body section. 
Preferably, the character further comprises head, tail and 
fin sections which are pivotally mounted to the main body 
section and oscillate with respect to the main body section 
as it rolls along. In a preferable embodiment the head and tail are 
prevented from rotating by more than 90°. Typically, the  
 
head and tail are also biassed towards a rest position by 
a spring, or by a weight placed at the bottom of the head 
or tail. A toy character according to the invention will now be 
described with reference to the accompanying Figures, in 
which:- 
Figure 1 is a side view, partly in section, of the toy 
character; Figure 2 is a rear view, partly in section; Figure 3 is a side view of the two rear wheels joined 
by an offset axle; Figure 4 is an end view of the two rear wheels; Figure 5 is a bottom view, partly in section, of the 
toy character; Figure 6 is a cross-section showing the tail hinges in 
detail; Figure 7

<CLAIMS>
A toy character comprising a main body section (1), 
two circular wheels (2,3) joined by an axle (5) journaled 

to the main body section (1), characterised in that the 
axle (5) is attached to at least one of the wheels at a 

position radially offset from the centre of the wheel. 
A character according to claim 1, wherein the axle (5) 
is attached to both wheels at a position radially offset 

from the centre of each wheel. 
A character according to claim 2, wherein the centre 
of each wheel is offset from the axle at an equal distance 

and an opposite direction from the other wheel. 
A character according to any of the preceding claims, 
further comprising a third wheel (4) mounted on a second 

axle joined to the main body section, whereby the third 
wheel comprises a third point of support of the main body 

section. 
A character according to any of the preceding claims, 
wherein the wheels (3,4,5) are curved in the axial 

direction. 
A character according to any of the preceding claims, 
further comprising a head member (11) rotatably mounted to 

the main body section (1). 
A character according to any of the preceding claims, 
further comprising a tail member rotatably mounted to the 

main body section (1). 
A character according to claim 6 or claim 7, further 
comprising limiting means (46,47) which limits the extent 

of rotation by the head and/or tail member. 
A character according to any of claims 6 to 8, further 
comprising biassing means (48,49) which biasses the head 

and/or tail to a rest position. 
A character according to any of the preceding claims, 
further comprising a fin or fins (23-25) slotted along and 

extending above the top of the main body section (1), 
wherein the or each fin includes flexible members (23'-25') 

which pass through slots (29-31) in the top of the main 
 

body section, and weights (26-28) attached to the other end 
of the or each flexible member, whereby the or each fin 

oscillates from side to side as the character moves along.
