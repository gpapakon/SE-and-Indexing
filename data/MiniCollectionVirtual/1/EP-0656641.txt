<ABSTRACT>
A trip unit (release unit) for a power circuit breaker or a protective switch, in particular as an undervoltage trip device which interacts with the switch drive mechanism in such a manner that, if the voltage is not sufficient, the trip unit unlatches the switch drive mechanism immediately, the trip unit having a trip coil 21, which is designed as a plunger-type armature coil and has a trip plunger 20 which is prestressed in the trip direction 30 by means of a compression spring and is inserted in a magnetic store housing, the end 2 of an arm 1b of a clamping lever 1, which is designed as a rocker, being pressed (during opening of the switch or when the locking mechanism is open) by a compression spring 5 into a cutout 32 which is located in a control cam 31 of the switch, such that the other arm 1a of the clamping lever 1 rotates the trip lever 12 in such a manner that the trip lever 12 is pivoted about its shaft 13 and, in consequence, presses the trip plunger 20 into the magnetic store housing 21.

<CLAIMS>
A trip unit for a circuit breaker or protected
switchgear, more particularly taking the form of an

undervoltage release, which so co-operates with the switch
drive mechanism that in case of inadequate voltage, the trip

unit immediately unlatches the switch drive mechanism, the
trip unit having a trip coil (21) which takes the form of a

sucking coil and has a trip tappet (20) loaded by a
compression spring in the trip direction (30) and

accommodated in a magnetic memory casing,
characterised in that
 during the opening of the switch or
when the switch latch is opened, the end (2) of one arm (1b)

of a clamping lever (1) constructed in the form of a rocker
is forced by a compression spring (5) into a recess (32) in

a control cam (31) of the switch, the other arm (la) of the
clamping lever (1) so rotating a trip lever (12) that said

trip lever (12) is pivoted around its pivot (13), thereby
forcing the trip tappet (20) into the magnetic memory

casing (21).
A trip unit according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the control cam (31) is so designed
that during the switching on operation the end (2) of one

arm (1b) of the spring-loaded clamping lever (1) is forced
against the force of the compression spring (5) into a

recess (27) in the casing cover (8) and pivots the clamping
lever (2) so far around its pivot (13) that the trip

lever (12) is released from the clamping lever (2). 
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 that the control cam (31) is attached
to the operating element (34).
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the control cam (31) is an arcuate
flat member which has an opening in the centre of the flat

side, the opening so enclosing the operating element (34)
that during the switching on and off of the switch the

operating element entrains the control cam (31), at the same
time moving around the axis of rotation of the operating

element (34).
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the recess (32) of the control cam
(31) is situated on the side (35) adjacent the trip unit.
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the recess (32) of the control
cam (31) has a ramp-shaped side (33) along which during the

switching on of the switch the end (2) of the arm (1b) of
the clamping lever (1) slides and can thereby be forced into

a recess (27) in the casing cover (8).
A trip unit according to claims 6 and 7,
characterised in that
 when the switch is switched on, the
narrow side (35) of the control cam (31) adjacent the trip

unit has rotated the clamping level (1) so far that said
clamping lever (1) releases the trip lever (12).
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the arm (1b) of the clamping lever (1)
co-operating with the control cam (31) has at its end a

tappet (2) which engages in the recess (32) of the control
cam (31). 
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the arm (1b) of the clamping lever (1)
co-operating with the control cam (31) is so subjected to

the pressure of a spring (5) that the arm (1b) of the
clamping lever (1) is forced out of the casing cover (8).
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the arm (1b) of the clamping lever (1)
co-operating with the control cam (31) has at its end on the

side adjacent the casing cover (8) a retaining means (4),
more particularly a cam, for receiving the compression

spring (5).
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the arm (1a) of the clamping lever (1)
is constructed arcuate and has on the inside of the arc an

operative surface (3) which co-operates with the trip
lever (12).
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the operative surface (3) of the
arm (1a) of the clamping lever (1) is so shaped that during

the rotary movement in the switching off of the switch the
trip lever (12) is so acted upon by pressure that the trip

lever (12) is pivoted around its pivot (13) in the direction
of the trip tappet (20) and forces the trip tappet (20)

completely into the magnetic memory casing (21).
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the trip lever (12) is a double lever
arm, the connecting web (13) of the two lever arms (14, 18)

being the pivot (13) of the trip lever (12). 
A trip unit according to claim 13,
characterised in that
 the arm (18) of the trip lever (12)
has at its end remote from the connecting web (13) a

cam (17) which co-operates with the operative surface (3) of
the clamping lever arm (1a).
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the arm (14) of the trip lever (12)
has a surface which preferably takes the form of a cam and

which co-operates with the trip tappet (20).

characterised in that
 the arm (14) of the trip lever (12)

surface (15) which co-operates with the switch-off
protective mechanism of the switch.
A trip unit according to one of the preceding claims,

and the longitudinal axis of the magnetic memory system (20,
