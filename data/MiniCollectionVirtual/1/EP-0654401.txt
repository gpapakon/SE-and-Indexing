<ABSTRACT>
A method of protecting a ship (2, 2') against an attacker (4) comprising a first release, from said attacked ship (2), of an automotive submarine device (1), moreover comprises at least one second release, from said automotive submarine device (1), of at least one decoy and/or scrambler (9) capable of emitting an acoustic decoy and/or scrambling signal. An automotive submarine device (1) capable of implementing said method comprises an electronic control unit (12), an automotive element (6) and moreover at least one element (8) towed by said automotive element (6), at least one towing cable (10) interposed between said elements (6, 8), said towed element comprising at least one releasable decoy and/or scrambler (9), which decoy and/or scrambler (9) comprises a transmitter (24) of an acoustic decoy and/or scrambling signal. Application to the protection of submarines against torpedoes.

<CLAIMS>
A process for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an attacker 4, comprising a first
dropping from the said attacked ship 2, a self-propelled submarine device 1

characterised in that in addition the said process comprises at least a second
dropping from the said self-propelled submarine device 1 of at least one decoy

and/or jammer 9 likely to emit a luring and/or jamming acoustic signal, each decoy
and/or jammer being deconnected from the self-propelled submarine device 1

during the dropping.
A process for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an attacker 4 according to claim 1,
characterised in that in addition the said process consists in listening an acoustic

signal of detection emitted by the said attacker 4 and emitting a luring echo in
response to the said acoustic sign
al of detection.
A process for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an attacker 4, according to any of
claims 1 and 2, characterised in that in addition the said process consists in

emitting a jammer prior to the said dropping of the self-propelled submarine
device 1.
A process for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an attacker 4 according to any of
claims 2 to 3, characterised in that in addition the said process comprises the

emission of an acoustic signal or luring and/or jamming noise emitted by the said
self-propelled submarine device 1, the said emission being simultaneous or

deferred in relation to the said emission of a luring echo in response to the said
acoustic signal of detection.
A process for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an attacker 4 according to any of
claims 1 to 4 characterised in that in addition the said process consists in

determining the parameters of the said dropping operation, the parameters of
emission of the said luring and/or jamming acoustic signal and the piloting

parameters of the attacked ship 2 and the self-propelled submarine device 1, so
that the attacked ship 2' and the submarine device 1 move sufficiently away from

each other to achieve a mask effect.
A process for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an attacker 4 according to claim 5
characterised in that the said determination of the parameters is programmed

prior to the said dropping of the self-propelled submarine 1 so that the said self-propelled
device 1 is autonomous.
A self-propelled submarine device 1 for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an
attacker 4, the said device comprising an electronic control unit 12 and a self-propelled

element 6, characterised in that the said self-propelled submarine
device 1 comprises in addition at least one element 8 towed by the self-propelled 

element 6, at least one towing cable 10 interposed between the said elements 6,
8, the said towed element comprising at least one decoy and/or jammer (9), the

said decoy and/or jammer 9 comprises one emitter 24 of luring and/or jamming
acoustic signal and can possibly be disconnected by dropping towed element 8.
A self-propelled submarine device 1 for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an
attacker 4,, according to claim 7, characterised in that in addition the said device

comprises at least one listening hydrophone 26 which can receive an acoustic
signal of detection emitted by the said attacker 4, and at least one active acoustic

signal 20, capable of emitting a luring echo in response to the said acoustic signal
of detection, and capable of emitting a luring and/or jamming acoustic signal.
A self-propelled submarine device 1 for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an
attacker 4, according to claims 8, characterised in that the said self-propelled

element 6 comprises the said active acoustic emitter 20.
A self-propelled submarine device 1 for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an
attacker 4, according to any of claims 8 and 9, characterised in that the said

towed element 8 comprises the said listening hydrophone 26.
A self-propelled submarine device 1 for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an
attacker 4, according to any of claims 7 to 10, characterised in that the said

towing cable 10 comprises a means of data transmission and a power supply
means.
A self-propelled submarine device 1 for protecting a ship 2, 2' against an
attacker 4, according to any of claim 7 to 11, characterised in that the said towed

element 8 comprises at least one fastening means 30 of the said decoy and/or
jammer 9, the said fastening means being releasable during the dropping

operation of the said decoy and/or jammer.
A device according to any of claims 7 to 12, characterised in that the length of
the said towing cable 10 is approximately included between 10 and 80 meters.
