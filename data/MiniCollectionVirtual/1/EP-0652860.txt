<ABSTRACT>
Use of hydrofluorocarbon-containing compounds of formula (I): RF-(CH2)n-X-[C3H5(OH)]-Y-(CH2)m-R'F, in which C3H5(OH) denotes the structures (Ia) or (Ib) or (Ic), RF and RF', which are the same or different, are a perfluorinated linear or branched C4-C20 alkyl radical or a mixture of perfluorinated, linear or branched C4-C20 alkyl radicals; m and n, which are the same or different, are 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4; X and Y, which are the same or different, are O or S. The invention also concerns some of these compounds and cosmetic compositions comprising same.
