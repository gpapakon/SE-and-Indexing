<ABSTRACT>
The opening-out device, according to the invention, for a sash (leaf) which can pivot and tilt comprises an opening-out arm (1) and a scissors housing (2), to which the opening-out arm (1) is connected in an articulated manner and - within a slot (3) - such that it can be displaced longitudinally. A guide part (4) is connected to the opening-out arm (1) via a rivot (5), which guide part (4) is guided displaceably within the slot (3). Connected to said guide part (4) is a resilient latching part (6) which, when the opening-out arm (1) is pivoted to the maximum extent, engages behind a latching protrusion of the scissors housing (2). Consequently, unintentional pivoting-back is prevented. In the exemplary embodiment represented, the latching protrusion is formed by the head (7) of an adjustment screw (8) which, running in the longitudinal direction of the scissors housing (2), is screwed into a fastening part (9) of the scissors housing (2). In addition to the otherwise necessary components, the anti-slamming safeguard for the opening-out device thus merely requires the additional latching part (6) which can be produced in one piece with the guide part (4).

<CLAIMS>
A stay arrangement for a turn-and-tilt movable portion of a 
window or a door, comprising a stay arm (1) which on the one hand can be 

pivotably connected by one end to a fixed frame of a window or a door and 
which on the other hand is mounted with another end pivotably and 

displaceably within a slot (3) of a scissor-type housing (2) which can be 
fixed at the movable portion of the window or door, wherein a guide 

portion (4) which is longitudinally displaceably mounted in the slot (3) 
of the scissor-type housing is connected to said other end of the stay 

arm and upon maximum possible pivotal movement as between the stay arm 
(1) and the scissor-type housing (2) unintentional return pivotal 

movement is prevented by a force-locking securing means and the securing 
means comprises a resilient retaining portion (6) which is connected to 

the guide portion (4) and which when the stay arm is pivoted out to the 
maximum extent engages behind at least one retaining projection arranged 

on the scissor-type housing (2), characterised in that for securing the 
extended position of the movable portion of the window or door the 

resilient movement of the retaining portion (6) extends transversely to 
the plane of the slot and the retaining projection is the head (7) of an 

adjusting screw (8) which extends in the longitudinal direction of the 
scissor-type housing (2) and which is screwed into a fixing portion (9) 

arranged in the scissor-type housing (2) and the head (7) is axially 
secured in an opening (10) provided in the adjoining region to the slot 

(3) or the retaining projection comprises a transverse web portion (12) 
of the scissor-type housing (2), said transverse web portion delimiting 

the slot (3) at one end thereof. 
A stay arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the retaining portion (6) and the guide portion (4) are in the form of 

separate members but are connected together jointly with a rivet (5) 
which also connects the guide portion (4) to the stay arm (1).
