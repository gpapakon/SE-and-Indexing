<ABSTRACT>
A system to be installed on a sail-boat for furling a spinnaker (1) and for remote fitting of the spinnaker (1) to a boom (2) swivel-mounted on the mast (3) of the sail-boat comprises a stay (4) offset with respect to the stay for the jib (5), a furling device (6) secured to the offset stay (4), at least one boom swivel-mounted on the mast (3), a spinnaker (1) fitted in the central part of its belly with at least one supple link (17) which can be attached to the furling device (6), a circular sheet (11) knotted at the end (9) of the boom (2) and passing through the tack of the spinnaker (1), the foot (13) of the mast (3) and a point (14) on the mast (3) at a predetermined height to serve as a topping lift for the articulated boom (2), said circular sheet (11) being passed through a cleat (12) and manoeuvered from the sail-boat cockpit to lower and raise said articulated boom (2) and bring the far end (9) of said boom into contact with said spinnaker (1).

Device for handling a spinnaker,
 
characterized in that the spinnaker (1) is provided with a 

becket (30) located substantially at a point on the median 
line (31) of the spinnaker (1),
 
and in that said handling device comprises: 


on the one hand, a furling element (32) comprising a furling 
core (33) extending over at least part of the height of the 

spinnaker (1), on the same side as the concave inner face (34) 
of said spinnaker; and, 
on the other hand, a flattening sheet (36) that can be 
secured at a point of attachment of said spinnaker (1) and 

that passes through said becket (30) towards a passing-on 
point (37) located on said furling element (32). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said 
becket (30) is located in the proximity of the median part of 

the base of said spinnaker (1). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the perforation for said becket (30) is 

made in a reinforced region (38) of said spinnaker (1). 
Handling device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that said passing-on point (37) for said 

flattening sheet is constituted by a shackle or equivalent 
device. 
Device according to any one claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that said flattening sheet (36) is provided with at least one 

locking knot (38) intended to abut, during handling, against 
the inner face or the outer face of said becket (30). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that said flattening sheet (36) is extended, on the same 

side as the convex outer face (35) of the spinnaker (1), 
towards the upper part of the spinnaker (1) so as to force the 

flattening of said unfurled spinnaker (1) towards said furling  
 

core (33) when a tensile force is exerted on said flattening 
sheet (36). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that said 
flattening sheet (36) is fixed substantially at the level of 

the halyard point (40) of said spinnaker (1). 
Device according to any one of claims 6 and 7,
 
characterized in that said flattening sheet is guided along 

the convex outer face (35) of said spinnaker by guide loops 
(41) attached to said spinnaker (1). 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that said 
guide loops (41) extend substantially along the median line of 

said spinnaker. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
 
characterized in that the handling end (42) of the flattening 

sheet (36) is frapped in a cleat (43). 
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that said 
cleat (43) works in conjunction with a twin cleat (44) 

intended to frap a sheet (45) for controlling the rotation of 
said furling core (33). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
 
characterized in that said flattening sheet (36) extends into 

the lower part of the spinnaker (1), on the same sides as the 
inner concave face (34) and outer convex face (35) of the 

spinnaker (1) alternately, and comes up again to the level of 
said becket (30), in such a way as to cause the concertina-like 

folding-up of said lower part of the spinnaker (1) when 
the flattening sheet (36) is tautened. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that said furling element (32) is equipped with an 

essentially cylindrical part (60) intended to be positioned  
 

around said furling core (33) in such a way as to be integral 
with it and to abut against the upper flange of the winding 

drum (52) of said furling element (32), said part being 
provided with at least one pulley (63) mounted essentially 

radially with respect to the longitudinal axis of said part 
(60) and constituting said passing-on point for said 

flattening sheet (36). 
Device according to claim 13, characterized in that said 
pulley (63) is provided in the upper part of said essentially 

cylindrical part (60). 
Device according to one of claims 13 or 14, characterized 
in that said pulley (63) is flush with the surface of said 

part (60) in such a way as to pass slightly beyond it. 
Device according to one of claims 13 to 15, characterized 
in that it comprises two pulleys (63, 64) positioned in one 

and the same vertical plane, said flattening sheet (36) 
arriving between the two pulleys. 
Device according to claim 16, characterized in that the 
upper pulley (64) preferably passes further beyond said 

cylindrical part (60) than the lower pulley (63) does. 
Device according to one of claims 13 to 17, characterized 
in that said essentially cylindrical part (60) is provided 

with means (65) for anchoring the furling element (32) to the 
drum (52). 
Device according to one of claims 13 to 18, characterized 
in that said essentially cylindrical part (60) is integrated 

into said furling element (32). 
Device according to one of claims 13 to 19, characterized 
in that said essentially cylindrical part (60) is constituted  

 
by at least two complementary elements (66, 67) that can be 

fitted around the furling core (33). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterized 
in that said furling element comprises a dual drum, the drums 

of which are provided with a cage (80) facilitating the 
winding of the fastening sheet. 
Device according to claim 21, characterized in that the 
entry hole (82) in the upper flange is provided with an 

element (81) that facilitates the sliding of the flattening 
sheet (36). 
Device according to claim 22, characterized in that said 
element is a pulley.
