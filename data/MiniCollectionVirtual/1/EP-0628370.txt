<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a soldering method and an 
apparatus employed therefor, more particularly to a method 
of carrying out soldering in an active atmosphere and an 
apparatus employed therefor. In order to carry out soldering neatly, it is important 
that the surface of the base-metal (material to be 
soldered) is clean at the time that the solder is fused. 
For such reason, the surface of the base-metal is generally 
purified (activated) using a flux. The soldering methods 
employing such flux are roughly divided into a step of 
applying a flux onto the base-metal at the portions to be 
soldered, a step of covering the to-be-soldered portions 
with the flux under activation of the surface of the base-metal 
with heating, so as to maintain said portions in the 
activated state, a step of fusing the solder to wet and 
spread the solder onto the activated base-metal surface, 
and a step of cooling the solder to be solidified and 
adhere the solder onto the base-metal. Some of the flux employed in the above method vaporizes 
because of the heat of soldering applied thereto, but some 
remains at the soldered portions. If the residual flux is 
left as such, it reacts with the moisture (humidity) in air 
to cause corrosion of the soldered portions or decrease in 
the insulation resistance thereof, leading to troubles such 
as deterioration in the functions of electronic appliances. Accordingly, in the electronic appliances etc. where 
reliability is of great account, cleaning for removing the  
 
flux is carried out after soldering. Meanwhile, the flux 
typically includes, for example, a rosin incorporated with 
an activating agent such as an amine halide, and Freon and 
trichlene exhibit excellent effects as the solvents for 
removing it. However, use of these solvents are more and 
more regulated, since they destroy the ozone layer 
surrounding the earth or contaminate the underground water. Under such circumstances, cleaning method not using such 
solvent is recently studied in the soldering factory of 
electronic appliances, and substitute cleaners such as 
water-soluble detergents and alcohols have been developed. 
However, these substitute cleaners involve a disadvantage 
in that the treatment of the substitute detergents after 
cleaning of the flux requires a tremendous cost. Thus, a 
soldering method not using such flux which must be washed 
off and an apparatus therefor have been desired to be 
developed. Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to 
provide a soldering method
