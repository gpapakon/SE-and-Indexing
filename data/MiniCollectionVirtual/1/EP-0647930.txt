<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an information slide or disc 
provided with a pop-up, and a method for manufacturing 
such an information slide or disc. Information slide cards provided with a pop-up are 
generally known. These are comprised of an envelope 
formed by a back cover sheet and a front cover sheet in 
which the pop-up is included, which pop-up is formed by 
two side edges and an upper and a lower edge and is 
connected to the cover sheet along the upper edge, 
while an inner sheet is disposed between the front 
cover sheet and the back cover sheet, which is formed 
by two side edges and an upper and a lower edge, which 
inner sheet between its two side edges has a width 
greater than the width between the side edges of the 
pop-up included in the cover sheet, such, that the 
material of the cover sheet adjacent to the side edges 
of the pop-up covers the side edges of the inner sheet, 
which inner sheet is slidable or rotatable in the 
envelope, while further the inner sheet is connected to 
the pop-up, such, that when the inner sheet is slided 
in the envelope the pop-up is folded up and elevates 
from the envelope. With the known pop-up card the pop-up and the inner 
sheet are glued to each other, and the pop-up at the 
side opposite of the direction of sliding out is adjoined 
by a flat section formed by the connection of the 
pop-up and the inner sheet, which detracts from an 
attractive appearance of the pop-up card. The invention aims to obviate this drawback of the 
known pop-up card. Further, the invention aims to  
 
provide a card, which allows the inner sheet to slide 
smoothly in the envelope, and which allows a smooth 
pop-up movement. The invention further aims to provide 
a method for manufacturing the pop-up card according to 
the invention in a simple and efficient manner. The information slide or disc according to the 
invention to that end is characterized in that the 
connection between the inner sheet and the pop-up is 
formed by a folding line. When the inner sheet is slided out, the pop-up at the 
side opposite of the direction of sliding out is not 
adjoined by a flat portion. A further advantage of this 
is that information which is printed on the inner side 
of the back cover sheet is covered up to a lesser 
extent by the material of the pop-up. According to a further characteristic of the invention, 
the side edges of the inner sheet and the side edges of 
the parts of the envelope which enclose the inner 
sheet, extend conically, such, that seen in the direction 
of

<CLAIMS>
Information slide provided with a pop-up 
[7]
, comprised of an envelope formed by a back cover 
sheet [1]
 and a front cover sheet [2] in which the pop-up 

[7] is included, which pop-up [7]
 is formed by two 
side edges [23, 24]
 and an upper edge [25] and a lower 

edge [26] and is connected to the cover sheet [2]
 along 
the upper edge [25]
, while an inner sheet [11] is 

disposed between the front cover sheet [2] and the back 

cover sheet [1], which is formed by two side edges [27, 

28] and an upper and a lower edge [29, 30]
, which inner 
sheet [11]
 between its two side edges [27, 28] has a 

width greater than the width between the side edges 
[23, 24]
 of the pop-up [7] included in the cover sheet 

[2], such that the material of the cover sheet [2]
 
adjacent to the side edges [23, 24]
 of the pop-up [7] 

covers the side edges [27, 28] of the inner sheet [11]
, 
which inner sheet [11]
 is slidable in the 
envelope, while further the inner sheet [11]
 is connected 
to the pop-up [7]
, such, that when the inner 
sheet is slid in the envelope the pop-up [7]
 is 
folded up and elevates from the envelope, characterized 

in that the connection between the inner sheet and the 
pop-up is formed by a fold line [6]
. 
Information slide according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the side edges [27, 28]
 of the inner sheet 
[11]
 and/or the side edges of the parts of the envelope 
which enclose the inner sheet [11]
, are formed conically, 
such, that seen in the direction of sliding out 

the side edges and/or the parts widen. 
Method for manufacturing an information slide card 
provided with a pop-up according to one of the

planar material [4]
 is divided according to two  
 

fold lines [5, 6] into at least one set of three sections, 

of which the first [1] and the second section [2]

cover sheet, respectively of an envelope, while in the front cover 
sheet the pop-up [7]
 is included, and which pop-up [7] 

is divided off from the material of the front cover 
sheet by at least one slit [8, 9]
 and one pop-up fold 
line [10]

an inner sheet [11] which is partially slidable in the 

envelope, which inner sheet [11] partially is cut 

loose from the material of the third section [3] by at 

least one slit [12, 13] terminating close to an edge 

[14] of the piece of planar material, and wherein the 

inner sheet [11] and the pop-up [7]

 is folded over the 
second section [2]
, after which the first section [1] 

is folded over the second section [2], and wherein the

section [2], after which from the accordingly folded 

set of the three sections a strip of the planar material 
is cut off at the connection [22]

sheet [11]
 and the third section [3], so that the inner 

sheet [11] becomes freely slidable from the material of 

the third section [3]. 
Method according to claim 3, characterized in that
