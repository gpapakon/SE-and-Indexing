<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hot melt inks for 
ink jet printers and, more particularly, to a hot melt ink 
that is solid at normal temperatures and used for printing 
after being thermally melted at temperatures higher than 
normal temperatures. Ink jet printers have many advantages in printing 
techniques, such as noiselessness, high speed, high 
quality and coloration. However, ink droplets jetted from 
an ink jet nozzle are directly deposited onto recording 
paper, causing the print quality and print drying time to 
be influenced depending on the type of recording paper. 
If low-quality paper is used for recording, a considerable 
deterioration in quality of the resultant print has been 
experienced. It is known that to solve this problem, hot melt 
ink having a melting point higher than room temperature is 
used, achieving print of a uniform dot size irrespective 
of the type of recording paper. Ink compositions for this 
purpose have been proposed including ink containing 
natural wax as disclosed in United States Patent No. 
4,390,369, ink containing stearic acid as disclosed in 
European Unexamined Patent Publication No. 99,682, and ink 
containing a C₂₀-C₂₄ acid or alcohol along with a ketone 
having a relatively high melting point, in which all the 
inks make use of dyes as a coloring material. Moreover, 
in United States Patent Nos. 4,659,383 and 4,822,418 hot 
melt inks are proposed in which solid pigments are 
dispersed in waxes or C₁₈-C₂₄ fatty acids having a melting 
point higher than 65°C. However, the known hot melt inks for ink jet 
printers described above have problems such as the degree 
of dye solubility when dyes are used as the coloring 
material. This limits the types of dyes that can be used. 
In addition, the ink cannot necessarily be kept stabilized  
 
when heated over a long time or on repetition of heating 
and cooling cycles. Poor color fastness to light is 
another problem. On the other hand, when pigments are 
used as the coloring material, good color fastness to 
light is attained but the dispersability of the pigments 
and the stability of the dispersed pigments are not always 
satisfactory. As a result, the ink's storage stability 
under heating conditions is not good. The invention provides hot melt inks having good 
dispersability, good dispersion stability and coloring 
material fusibility, and excellent heat stability and 
color fastness to light. In particular, the invention provides a hot melt 
ink for an ink jet printer, comprising a solid wax that is 
soli
