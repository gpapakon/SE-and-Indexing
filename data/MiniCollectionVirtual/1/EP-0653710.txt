<ABSTRACT>
A speech information processor includes a first execution device (CPU (1)) and 
a second execution device (DSP (6)) for executing operations at respective different 

execution cycles, and a first memory (2) for reading and recording speech information. 
The CPU (1) and the DSP (6) exploit the first memory (2) in common for processing 

the speech information. The processor further includes a second memory (FIFO (3)) 
for storage of speech information from the CPU (1) or speech information read out 

from the first memory (2). The CPU (1) records the speech information on or reads 
the speech information from the second memory (3) during the execution cycle of the 

CPU. The DSP (6) accesses the first memory (2) during the execution cycle of the 
DSP for outputting the speech information to outside. The speech information 

recorded in the second memory (3) is read out and recorded in the first memory (2), 
or the speech information recorded in the first memory is read out and recorded in the 

second memory during the time of not accessing the first memory. Data transfer 
between the CPU (1) and the second memory (3) can be performed during the 

execution cycle of the CPU, while that between the second memory and the first 
memory (2) can be performed during the execution cycle of the DSP (6), so that it is 

possible for the CPU to perform data transfer independently, such that sound source 
data can be transferred at a higher speed by employing a high-speed device as the 

CPU.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a speech information processor which may, for
example, advantageously be employed in an electronic musical instrument or a
television game device.The sound sources employed in general in an electronic musical instrument or
a television game may be roughly classified into analog sound sources, comprising a
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), a voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA), a voltage-controlled
filter (VCF) etc., and digital sound sources, such as a programmable sound
generator (PSG) or a zigzag readout type ROM.As an example of a digital sound source, Japanese Patent Applications
Publications No. JP-A-62264099 (1987) or JP-A-62267798 (1987) disclose a
sampler sound source in which sound source data sampled from live instrument sound
and digitally processed is stored in a memory for use as a sound source.The above-mentioned sound source (sampler sound source) stores only sound
source data of a pre-set pitch (interval) after compression by, for example, non-linear
quantization. Each sound source data is stored in two parts, that is in a formant
portion (FR) and a one-period portion (LP) of plural repeated waveforms of the
fundamental period following the formant portion, as shown in Fig.4. The formant
portion is a signal waveform at the initial stage of sound production proper to each
musical instrument, such as a sound produced from when a key of a keyboard is
struck until a hammer hits the string in the case of a piano. 
During readout of the sound source data, the formant portion is
read out first and the one-period portion is read out a plurality
of times.Since the above sound source data is compressed, and only
the required portions, that is the above formant portion and the
one-cycle repetitive portion, are extracted and stored, a large
quantity of sound source data may be stored in a smaller storage
space.As a general speech information processor for data
processing of the sampler sound source, an audio
processing unit (APU) 107 consisting of a digital signal
processing unit (DSP) 101, a memory 102 and a central processing
unit (CPU) 103, as shown in Fig.10, has been proposed.In this figure, the APU 107 is connected to a host computer
104, provided in a customary personal computer, a digital
electronic musical instrument or a TV game machine.The host computer 104 includes a ROM cassette storing the
above-mentioned sound source data, control programs, etc. The
control program stored in the ROM cassette is read out by the CPU
103 so as to be stored in a working memory
