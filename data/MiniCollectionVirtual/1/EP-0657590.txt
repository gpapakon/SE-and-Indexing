<ABSTRACT>
An excavator control apparatus for a shovel type 
construction equipment is so constructed as to allow 

correction of the operation commands generated to each 
of the cylinders 11, 12, and 13 by operating lever 22L 

or operating lever 22R is an automatic digging control 
mode where the digging load serves as standard. 
The control apparatus allows operations to be 
carried out easily with high precision and efficiency 

by facilitating corrections during automatic digging 
control mode in which the digging load serves as a 

datum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an excavator control
apparatus for construction equipment of the type having a shovel such as a
hydraulically operated shovel.In general, in some such shovel type construction
equipment, the boom, arm, and bucket, which comprise the
operation section, are successively rotatably connected to the
equipment body, with the boom, arm and bucket each having
connected thereto cylinders which expand and contract by lever
operation. Digging with such equipment must be carried out by a
very experienced operator because each of the cylinders must be
operated separately. Since there are not enough experienced
operators today, a shovel type construction equipment has been
proposed in which each of the cylinders are automatically
controlled to perform automatic digging. However, in such an
equipment which carries out automatic digging so that the
digging load remains constant, a large variation in digging
depth may occur due to changes in the hardness of the ground to
be dug or the presence of obstacles. This gives rise to the
problem that digging with high precision cannot be achieved. In
particular, when the ground is excavated beyond an intended
depth, earth must be returned to ground, so that digging
efficiency is considerably reduced. In addition, in correcting 
the variations in digging depth, the automatic digging
control mode must be cancelled every time to operate
the lever, which results in increased number of
digging steps, thereby reducing digging efficiency.WO-A-9102853 discloses an automatic excavation
control system in which a number of different modes of
operation are possible, for example: modes in which a
particular part of the excavation equipment can be
kept at a fixed orientation, modes in which excavation
is limited to certain defined areas, a mode which
monitors the forces on the driving cylinders and an
automatic mode which in principle requires no human
intervention once initiated. However, there is no
disclosure of automatically switching between modes in
accordance with pre-determined conditions.In view of the above-described problems, the
present invention is aimed at providing an excavator
control apparatus for a shovel type construction
equipment. According to the present invention, there
is provided an excavator control apparatus for
construction equipment of the type which has a movable
boom, an arm pivotably coupled to the boom, a bucket
carried by the arm, an operating section rotatably
coupled to the equipment body, and operating cylinders
for

<CLAIMS>
An excavator control apparatus for construction
equipment of the type which has a movable boom (8), an

arm (9) pivotably coupled to the boom, a bucket (10)
carried by the arm, an operating section (3, 4) rotatably

coupled to the equipment body, and operating cylinders
(11, 12, 13) for operating the boom, arm and bucket, said

operating section comprising an automatic digging control
section (7) which allows automatic digging by controlling

the operation of each of said cylinders, and being
characterised by


digging load control means (7, 23, 27) for detecting
a digging load when a digging depth is shallower than a

set digging depth during automatic digging and for
generating operating commands for each of the cylinders

(11, 12 13) so that the cylinders are operable to
maintain said detected digging load at a set load;
bucket path control means (7, 14, 15, 16) for
generating operating commands to each of the cylinders

so that the cylinders are operated in such a way that the
bucket is caused to follow a path, during automatic

digging, which corresponds to a set path; and
control automatic switching means (7) for
automatically switching between a digging load control

mode and a bucket path control mode in accordance with
predetermined conditions.
An excavator control apparatus according to claim
1, wherein automatic switching from a digging load

control mode to a bucket path control mode is arranged to
be done by detecting that a digging depth has reached a

set digging depth.
An excavator control apparatus according to claim
1, wherein automatic switching from a bucket path control

mode to a digging load control mode is arranged to be
done when a digging overload has been detected.
An excavator control apparatus according to claim
1, wherein the control automatic switching means (7)

includes first control automatic switching means (7) for
automatically switching the mode from a digging load

control mode to a bucket path control mode when a digging
depth has reached a set digging depth, and second control

automatic switching means (7) for automatically switching
the mode from a bucket path control mode to a digging

load control mode when a digging overload has been
detected.
An excavator control apparatus according to any one
of claims 1, 2 and 4 wherein said automatic digging

control section further includes operation command
correcting means (7) for correcting the operating

commands for each of the cylinders based on the operation 
of a lever (22L, 22R) during automatic digging; and


depth limiting means for correcting the operating
commands for each of the cylinders (11, 12, 13) so as to

prevent a digging depth during automatic digging from
becoming greater than a set digging depth.
