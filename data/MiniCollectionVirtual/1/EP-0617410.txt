<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing a magnetoresistive magnetic head in which a 
first insulation layer (5) of a non-magnetic material is formed on a support face (3a), on 

which insulation layer a soft-magnetic layer having an upper face remote from the first 
insulation layer is formed by deposition of a soft-magnetic material. Subsequently a 

layer portion is removed for forming the flux-guiding elements (17a, 17b) and an 
aperture extending between said elements, and non-magnetic material for forming a 

second insulation layer (18) having an upper face remote from the soft-magnetic layer is 
deposited on the soft-magnetic layer and in the aperture formed therein, which second 

insulation layer has such a thickness that, viewed in a direction transverse to the support 
face, the smallest distance between the support face and the upper face of the second 

insulation layer is larger than the largest distance between the support face and the 
upper face of the soft-magnetic layer. Subsequently, a mechanochemical polishing 

treatment is performed as from the upper face of the second insulation layer for forming 
a main surface (19) at which magnetoresistive material is subsequently deposited for 

forming a magnetoresistive element (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic
head comprising a magnetoresistive element and at least one flux-guiding element,
which method starts from a support.Methods of manufacturing thin-film magnetic heads are known, inter alia
from EP-A 0 516 022. The magnetic heads obtained by means of the methods described
in EP-A 0 516 022 are integrated magnetic heads having a contact face and comprising
an inductive part and a magnetoresistive part.In accordance with a first method known from EP-A 0 516 022 a first
structured insulation layer of SiO2 is formed on a magnetic substrate of a ferrite by
means of a lithographic method, which layer is subsequently provided with a layer of
Au for forming a write coil. Subsequently, a second structured insulation layer is
provided on which a core layer of an amorphous material based on Co is deposited.
This core layer is in contact with the magnetic substrate via apertures in the insulation
layers. The parts of the second insulation layer not coated by the core layer are filled up
by means of a filling layer of Al2O3. After the filling layer has been formed. the core
layer and the filling layer are planed by means of lapping. A third structured insulation
layer of SiO2 is deposited on the surface thus obtained on which subsequently a bias
winding of Au is formed. A fourth structured insulation layer of SiO2 is provided on
this winding. Subsequently, a magnetoresistive element of permalloy is formed on this
insulation layer. Then a fifth structured insulation layer of SiO2 is provided and
subsequently a yoke of an amorphous material which is based on Co and is in contact
with the core layer via apertures in the three last-mentioned insulation layers.In accordance with a second method known from EP-A 0 516 022 two
flux guides of a Co-based amorphous material are provided on a non-magnetic
substrate, while an aperture between the two flux guides is filled with a first insulation
layer of SiO2. The surface formed by the flux guides and the first insulation layer is
provided with a second structured insulation layer on which subsequently a
magnetoresistive (MR) element is formed. The MR element is then coated with a third
structured insulation layer on which subsequently a bias winding is formed. A fourth 
structured insulation layer is provided for the purpose of coating the bias winding.
Subsequently, a magnetic core layer of a Co-based material is formed which is in
contact with one of the flux guides via apertures in the three
