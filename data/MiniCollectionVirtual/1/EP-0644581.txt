<ABSTRACT>
In a wafer stepper for fabricating semiconductor ICs 
(Integrated Circuits), a glass substrate (31) carries thereon a 

plurality of octagonal patterns (36) formed of a transmissive 
material. With such a glass substrate (31), the stepper diffracts 

light not only in X and Y directions but also in 45° directions 
and 135° directions. A mask pattern (7,8) is transferred to a wafer 

(40) with enhanced resolution and depth of focus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wafer stepper for
fabricating semiconductor ICs (Integrated Circuits) and, more
particularly, to a wafer stepper for forming a fine pattern on
a semiconductor substrate accurately.In the semiconductor ICs art, the degree of integration
is quadrupling every three years, thanks to fine circuit
pattern technologies. For example, to form a fine VLSI (Very
Large Scale Integrated circuit) pattern on a semiconductor
substrate, use is made of reduced-scale projection exposure
capable of forming the fine pattern on the substrate
accurately. A device for effecting the reduced-scale
projection exposure is usually referred to as a wafer stepper,
or simply stepper, and basically comprised of a mercury lamp
or similar light source, reflector, first convex lens, fly's eye
lens, aperture, second convex lens, a mask having a fine
pattern, and a projection lens.In the wafer stepper, light issuing from the light source
is condensed by the reflector, uniformalized by the first
convex lens and fly's eye lens, restricted by the aperture to a 
suitable size, and then incident to the mask via the second
convex lens. The light incident to the mask is diffracted by a
fine pattern, i.e., chromium pattern. As a result, zero order
light, + first order light and - first order light are incident to
the projection lens. Diffracted lights of second order and
above advance in a direction angled more than the zero order
diffracted light and are, therefore, usually not incident to the
projection lens. The diffracted lights are focused onto a
wafer or substrate and forms an aerial image identical with
the chromium pattern in a reduced scale.To meet the increasing demand for fine IC patterns, the
stepper should be provided with an ability to expose finer
patterns, i.e., resolution. The resolution R of a stepper is
expressed by using the Rayleigh's equation, as follows:
R = K1 λ/NA
where λ is the wavelength of exposing light, NA is the
aperture number of the projection lens, and K1 is a constant
determined by resist performance. The above equation
indicates that for higher resolution, it is necessary that the
wavelength of the exposing light be reduced, or that the
aperture number NA of the projection lens be increased. When
the wavelength λ is reduced, only excimer laser beams,
including KrF excimer laser beam (249 nm) or ArF excimer 
laser beam (193 nm), are available which have wavelengths
shorter than that of the conventional g beam (463 nm) and i
beam of a mercury lamp and have illumination necessary
