<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a modular device (1) for 
access to electrical and/or optical signals transiting in a 

distribution frame (4) of power stations or telephone 
exchanges (3) of the type comprising a plurality of basic 

modules (2) associated with each other in such a manner as 
to provide plural configurations for exchange and/or 

rerouting of said electrical signals and each module having 
at least one input terminal (IN) connected to an output 

terminal (OUT) for transit of the electrical signals. 
Each module (2) comprises: 

an access terminal (P), 
switching means (SW) inserted in the connection between 
the input and output terminals (IN, OUT), 
a decoupler (D) inserted between the output terminal 
(OUT) and the access terminal (P), and 
a command circuit (C) for the switching means (SW) 
actuated by an electrical signal applied to the access 

terminal (P). 
The command necessary for choice of the type of access 
made, monitor or isolated, is normally sent to the device 

through the access terminal (P). This interface (P) is 
also used for sending the command for optional choice of 

the side to which to accede in isolation, the IN side or 
the OUT side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modular device for 
access to high frequency electrical signals transiting in a 
distribution frame for telephone exchanges. More specifically the present invention relates to a 
modular device for access to electrical signals transiting 
in a distribution frame for power stations or telephone 
exchanges of the type comprising a plurality of basic 
modules associated with each other in such a manner as to 
provide plural configurations for switchover and/or 
rerouting of said electrical signals and each module having 
at least one input terminal connected to an output terminal 
for transit of said electrical signals. The field of application of the invention concerns in 
particular but not exclusively access to and supervision of 
the connections to the channels in transit and the 
description given below is made for this field of 
application with the only purpose of simplifying the 
exposition thereof. As known, in the specific field of application of the 
present invention operators of communications networks 
require: 
improvement of the quality of the services offered to 
users, and automation of the location of malfunctions in TLC 
networks and rationalisation of maintenance of  
 
communications systems to reduce management costs. To satisfy these requirements it is necessary to accede to 
the signals transiting in the distribution frames AF 
through diagnostic devices which allow monitoring of 
transiting signals and, under failure conditions, sending 
of test signals for corrective maintenance of the 
connections. Insertion in the network of a diagnostic device has however 
some drawbacks described below. On one hand there would be a decrease in the overall 
reliability of the communications network since electronics 
is added in series with the signal. On the other hand there 
would be a considerable financial burden for wiring of the 
connections between the distribution frame and the 
diagnostic device. A known prior art solution is disclosed in the internation 
application No. WO-A-91/02423 which relates to a cable pair 
tester for accessing transiting signals in a distribution 
frame of telephone systems/exchanges. Said device comprises 
a plurality of connectors inserted in the cable pairs. Each connector comprises one portion which is removably 
connected to the cable pairs and another portion which 
consists of a cable for connecting the cable pairs to a 
cable pair tester. The first portion is a removable plug. This prior art solution doesn't provide
