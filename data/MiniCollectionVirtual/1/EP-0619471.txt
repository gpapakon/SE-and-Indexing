<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a motion sensor. The method 
comprises the steps of providing a substrate wafer (10); 

depositing a first layer of resist (12) upon said substrate 
wafer (10); removing selected areas of said first resist layer 

(12), thereby to provide first etch windows; forming first 
cavities (16) in the substrate wafer (10) by a first etching 

process through said first windows; bonding a relatively thick 
membrane wafer (24) to the substrate wafer (10), thereby 

covering said cavities (16); polishing the surface of the 
relatively thick membrane wafer (24) thereby to produce a 

relatively thin membrane (24a); depositing a second layer of 
resist (33) on said relatively thin membrane (24a); removing 

selected areas of said second deposited resist layer, thereby 
to provide second etch windows (40); etching away the 

relatively thin membrane (24a) in the region of the second 
etch windows (40) until the first cavities (16) are exposed, 

thereby to form in said relatively thin membrane (24a) a free 
standing resonator structure (18) suspended on a plurality of 

compliant beam mounts (38) extending from a fixed portion 
(50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a motion sensor and relates particularly but 
not exclusively to the manufacture of a motion sensor of 
the type used to detect rotation about a central axis. British patent application number 9105060.9 discloses 
an example of a vibrating rate sensor which employs a 
bonded stack of three plates with excitation and pickoff 
transducing achieved by electrostatic techniques. 
Unfortunately, the form of construction used in this 
arrangement results in a relatively bulky sensor which is 
expensive to make. Microfabricated silicon sensors are finding 
application in a variety of applications; these 
commercially available sensors employ thin membranes (eg 
pressure sensors) and occasionally have resonators of 
free-standing cantilever or beam form [Greenwood et al.]. 
These membranes are typically restricted to only 15 Âµm 
thickness or less on account of technical problems of film 
stresses when depositing layers in a CVD furnace (chemical 
vapour deposition) or diffusing sufficient boron into the 
silicon wafer surface to form an effective etch-stop to 
anisotropic etches. Moreover, recent research [1] has 
shown that the heavy boron doping ( > 1 atom of boron to 
1000 atoms of silicon) causes instabilities, manifested as 
ageing effects, in the elasticity of the silicon membranes 
produced by subsequent anisotropic etching; although  
 
compensation can be applied to stabilise elasticity by 
applying simultaneous germanium diffusion with the boron, this 
does not avoid additional further microcracking problems in 
the membrane. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
method of manufacturing a motion sensor of very compact 
construction, avoids the problem of having to align substrates 
accurately with another during assembly and attempts to retain 
the near perfect mechanical qualities of the single crystal 
silicon wafer used to form the resonator or vibrating portion 
of the sensor. In addition to this, the proposed method does 
not compromise the ability of a resonator, of hoop-like or 
ring form suspended on a compliant mount, from permitting 
multi-axial inertial sensing to be achieved. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of 
manufacturing a motion sensor, characterised by the steps of 
providing a substrate wafer; depositing a first layer of resit 
upon said substrate wafer, removing selected areas of said 
first resist layer, thereby to provide first etch windows; 
forming first cavities in the substrate
