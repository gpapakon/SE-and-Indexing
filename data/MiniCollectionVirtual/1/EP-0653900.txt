<ABSTRACT>
An oven with a humidity conditioner is capable of cooking food by 
appropriately humidifying or dehumidifying it while the amount of steam 

contained in an oven cavity is being regulated. The oven includes a heater or 
magnetron for heating the food accommodated in the oven cavity, a humidity 

regulator for regulating the humidity inside the oven cavity, a cooking method 
selector for selecting a cooking method, and a controller for controlling the 

humidity regulator in response to a signal from the cooking method selector to 
selectively humidify and dehumidify the interior of the oven cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an oven such as a microwave oven, a
cooking range or the like and, more particularly, to an oven with a humidity conditioner
capable of cooking food by appropriately humidifying or dehumidifying it,
i. e., by appropriately regulating the amount of moisture.US-A-4 924 072 representing the closest prior art from which the invention
proceeds discloses a combination steam and dry oven having an integral boiler
which is located inside the oven cavity. The combination oven can be operated as
a forced-air convection oven, a force convection oven circulating superheated
steam, or a steamer near the boiling temperature of water. Sensors in the oven
supply information to a microprocessor which controls heating elements to maintain
an oven temperature within a predetermined temperature range. The oven
functions by circulating superheated steam by blowing its circulating gas over the
surface of the internal boiler which is protected from contamination by a baffle.
Sensors of the level of water in the boiler assure that the water level either stays
within predetermined limits or else shuts down the oven if the water level is out of
limits. Tray stops keep foods and the trays containing them away from the walls 
of the oven to permit free circulation of air or superheated steam. Sensors of water
temperature in the boiler and gas temperature in the circulating gas permit the
control of relative humidity when the oven is used to proof dough or hold cooked
food at a relatively low temperature. Control of the temperature of water in the
boiler is aided by blow-down and replacement of the temperature becomes excessive.
Accordingly, in this conventional oven the regulating of humidity is performed
by means of the boiler which evaporates steam (humidifying) or by draining water
(dehumidifying).From US-A-4 835 351, it is known an oven comprising a cabinet having a plurality
of cooking cavities, air recirculating units for circulating air through each cooking
cavity, and a humidity control apparatus for controlling humidity of air circulated
through the cavity. Programmable controls regulate air flow through the
recirculating units to provide controlled pulses of air of controlled temperature and
humidity to provide a desired surface moisture content. The humidifying is caused
by means of air flowing along a water tray, whereas the dehumidifying is brought
about by venting air.EP-A-0 000 957 discloses a microwave oven sensing system having a humidity
sensor and a temperature sensor
