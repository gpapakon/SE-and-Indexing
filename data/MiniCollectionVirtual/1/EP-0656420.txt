<ABSTRACT>
A test device is disclosed which has at least one independent sample retaining portion on a substrate, and which is used for 
a chemical test or a microbial test. It can be used for various kinds of chemical experiments and microbial tests which require a 

lot of reactions and cultures, and which were conducted in the past by using a plastic microplate. The test device can be manufactured 
at a very low cost owing to its simple construction. This device can also be precharged with a required reagent, and enables 

a test to be conducted very easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a test kit usable for a 
chemical or microbiological test, particularly for the determination of 
antimicrobial susceptibility by a microdilution broth method. A plastic microplate having wells is usually used as a reaction 
or culture vessel in a chemical test comprising a step of reacting a 
chemical sample with a reagent or in a microbiological test comprising 
a step of culturing a microorganism in a sample, particularly in a test 
wherein many samples are treated, the sample is reacted with various 
reagents or the culture must be conducted in various systems. For example, a plastic plate having many small wells is 
generally used in an immunological test such as ELISA. In the 
determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility, namely determination 
of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), by the microdilution 
broth method, a conventional single disc method comprising an agar 
plate dilution or agar diffusion is further improved by saving lavor and 
also by automation. The MIC determination method by the microdilution 
broth method was standardized by Nippon Kagaku Ryoho Gakkai (Japan 
Chemotherapy Society) in 1989. In this method, the use of the same 
microplate having U-shaped wells as that used in an immunological test  
 
is suggested. In a test wherein such a microplate is used, each reaction or 
culture of a microorganism is conducted in a different well of the plate. 
For example, in the MIC determination by the microdilution broth method 
wherein such a microplate is used, an antibacterial drug of varied 
concentrations is fed into each well, and the growth of the bacteria in 
each well is observed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration. 
For such a test, a microplate prepared by pouring given amounts of the 
antibacterial drug into the wells thereof and drying the plate or 
freeze-storing thereof has been put on the market. However, 
inexpensive microplates is not available on the market, since the cost 
of the microplates perse is high. Under these circumstances, it is 
eagerly demanded by users to lower the cost. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an 
inexpensive test kit usable for a chemical test or microbiological test 
in which the reaction or culture in various ways with a relatively small 
amount of a sample is necessitated as described above. The inventors have noticed that the concept of the test kit is 
not to be restricted to that of conventional test kits such as the 
above-described microplates, that
