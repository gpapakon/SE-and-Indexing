Method for fastening on the frame (1) of an apparatus, such as a 
facsimile device, a support plate (2) of an optical detector with a 

charge couple circuit, characterised in that it comprises the step of 
applying the said plate to an abutment surface (3) of the said frame 

with the aid of an abutment member (4) which can move substantially 
perpendicular to the plane of the said plate and has no freedom of 

movement parallel to the said plane. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the abutment member is 
displaced substantially perpendicular to the plane of the plate by 

actuation of a rotational tightening member (6) without contact with 
the said plate. 
Device for fastening on the frame (1) of an apparatus, such as a 
facsimile device, a support plate (2) of an optical detector with a 

charge couple circuit, characterised in that it comprises an abutment 
surface (3) formed on the said frame, and an abutment member (4) 

which can move substantially perpendicular to the said abutment 
surface and has no freedom of movement parallel to the said abutment 

surface. 
Device according to claim 3, wherein the said abutment member 
comprises an elastic tongue produced as one piece with the said 

frame. 
Device according to either of claims 3 and 4, comprising 
rotational tightening means (6) to displace the said abutment member 

substantially perpendicular to the said abutment surface. 
Device according to claim 5, wherein the said rotational 
tightening means are arranged to pass through the said plate without 

friction.  
 
Device according to either of claims 5 and 6, wherein the said 
rotational tightening means comprise a screw passing through the said 

abutment member and cooperating with a nut which is rotationally 
fixed in a recess formed in the frame.
