<ABSTRACT>
A circuit is utilized to reject false edges from a 
digital input signal to be provided to a digital circuit 

from a transmission line. The circuit includes circuitry 
for sensing the rising and falling edges of the signal 

and programmably filtering those edges such that the 
proper signal is transmitted to the digital circuit. The 

circuit also can be utilized at a plurality of power 
supply voltage ranges to remove such false edges without 

appreciably affecting the performance thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital integrated
circuits and more particularly, the present invention
relates to an apparatus for minimizing false edges at the
input thereof.Integrated circuits often receive digital
signals from transmission lines. It is known that even
though the ideal input signal is a rectangular signal
which has straight edges it is known that transmission
line signals are noisy. This noise creates complicated
shapes of the signal on the transmission line such that
there are reflections thereon. Many of these types of
transmission signals are so complicated and noisy that
glitches can be received at the integrated circuit input.
These noisy signals produce false edges which can cause
improper circuit operation.As is generally well known, in order to provide
smaller and faster devices in CMOS process technology
circuits have a reduced scaling or a shrinking of the
geometries thereof. For example, the gate length of the
devices, which have been around 1.6 microns, are further
reduced to under 1 micron so as to achieve higher speeds
of operation. In particular, when the effective length
of the gate decreases the gate delay will be reduced so 
as to yield faster devices. However, the shrinking of
the sizes of the integrated semiconductor devices to a
smaller size has not been accomplished without any
resulting problems. Such semiconductor devices of
reduced dimensions fail generally from being more noise
sensitive (i.e., lower noise immunity) and being not
capable of providing reliable data transfer.One application where noise immunity and reliable
data transfer becomes important is in the field of data
transmission on a fully loaded Small Computer System
Interface (SCSI) bus line which is coupled from a
transmission line for communication with small computers.
The basic problem encountered when transferring data on
the SCSI bus line is due to noise and glitches which may
cause double strobing of the data. The glitches are more
hazardous when they appear on the request (REQB) and
acknowledge (ACKB) lines.The control signals REQB and ACKB are used to
perform a "handshake" so as to transfer the data back and
forth between a target (i.e., disc drive) and an
initiator (i.e., host computer). A glitch occurring in
the control signal REQB can cause one or more extra bytes
to be counted during long data transfers at the transfer
rate of between 1.0-10 Mbytes/sec. On the other hand,
the incorrect or wrong data could be transferred such as
when an early control signal REQB occurs and the
