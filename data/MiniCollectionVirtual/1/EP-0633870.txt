<ABSTRACT>
A body of carbonaceous or other material for use in corrosive environments such as oxidizing media or gaseous or liquid corrosive agents at elevated temperatures, in particular in molten salts such as cryolite, is coated with a protective surface coating which improves the resistance of the body to oxidation or corrosion and which may also enhance the bodies electrical conductivity and/or its electrochemical activity. The protective coating is applied in one or more layers from a colloidal slurry containing reactant or non-reactant substances, or a mixture of reactant and non-reactant substances, in particular mixtures containing silicon carbide and molybdenum silicide or silicon carbide and silicon nitride, which when the body is heated to a sufficient elevated temperature reaction sinter as a result of micropyretic reaction and/or sinter without reaction to form the protective coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to bodies of materials such
as, for example, carbonaceous materials, for use in
corrosive environments such as oxidising media or gaseous
or liquid corrosive agents at elevated temperatures,
coated with a protective surface coating which improves
the resistance of the bodies to oxidation or corrosion and
which may also enhance the electrical conductivity and/or
electrochemical activity of the body.Carbonaceous materials are important engineering
materials used in diverse applications such as aircraft
bodies, electrodes, heating elements, structural
materials, rocket nozzles, metallurgical crucibles, pump
shafts, furnace fixtures, sintering trays, induction
furnace susceptors, continuous casting dies, ingot molds,
extrusion canisters and dies, heat exchangers, anodes,
high temperature insulation (porous graphite), gas
diffusers, aerospace structural materials, bearings,
substrates in electronics industry, brazing and joining
fixtures, diamond wheel molds, nozzles, glass molds etc.
Although carbonaceous materials have properties which make
them useful for the applications mentioned above, the
resistance to oxidation is one property which has limited
the use of these materials. Much effort is therefore 
underway to improve the resistance to oxidation of such
materials.US patent 4,921,731 discloses a substrate coated
with a ceramic coating. The coating is applied from a
colloidal slurry and may contain reactant or non-reactant,
non-colloidal particulate.Traditional methods of preventing oxidation of
carbonaceous materials have involved the deposition of
adherent and highly continuous layers of materials such as
silicon carbide or metals such as aluminum. The deposit of
such materials has normally been carried out by techniques
such as vapor deposition (both PVD and CVD) or by
electrochemical methods. Vapor deposition is an extremely
slow and costly process and additionally may not be
carried out for large parts such as electrodes. It is also
known to plasma spray alumina/aluminium onto the sides of
carbon anodes used as anodes for aluminium electrowinning,
but this coating method is expensive. Other techniques
such as electrochemical methods are limited in the type of
materials that may be applied as coatings and size
limitations again may be present. Sol-gel techniques are
known for the application of coatings. However, it is well
known that these techniques are not adequate for oxidation
protection, because they produce extremely thin films,
usually of the order of 1 micrometer
