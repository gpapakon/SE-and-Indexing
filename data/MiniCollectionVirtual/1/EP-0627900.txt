<ABSTRACT>
This invention discloses methods of repairing structurally defective or inadequately functioning muscles of the anal sphincter and methods of improving the competency of incompetent anal sphincters by administering an effective amount of an injectable biomaterial into the defect or into the anal sinuses. Preferred biomaterials to be used in this invention are collagen formulations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of medical
implants and prostheses. More particularly, it
concerns use of a collagen biomaterial in the
manufacture of a product for repairing structurally
defective or inadequately functioning anal sphincters
and for improving the competency of anal sphincters.Anal sphincters are muscular structures that assist
in controlling the flow of body wastes (feces and flatus) from
the colon. The internal anal sphincter (IAS) and the external
anal sphincter (EAS) encircle the anal canal and comprise the
anorectal ring. The IAS is a thickening of the
gastrointestinal smooth muscle; it maintains continence at
rest. The EAS is composed of striated, voluntary muscle. The
EAS, the puborectalis, and the levator ant muscles work in
concert to prevent leakage of flatus and feces when there is an
increase in abdominal pressure or when the internal anal
sphincter relaxes after rectal distention.When one or both sphincters become defective or
incompetent, the control of feces and/or flatus is impaired.
Incontinence of the feces and flatus is socially and
psychologically disabling for the afflicted patient. It is a
major factor prejudicing the rehabilitation and placement
prospects of the elderly and disabled, preventing many of them
from being cared for at home.The normal mechanisms of anorectal continence
include the motor function of the anal sphincters and pelvic
floor muscles, the role of the rectum and sigmoid colon as a
fecal reservoir with capacitance and compliance and as a 
propulsive force with intrinsic motor activity, the effects of
stool consistency, volume and delivery rate, the anorectal
angle, and anorectal sensation. It is the coordinated
integration of these factors that confers continence.There are two distinct etiologies for anorectal
incontinence. The most common cause of anorectal incontinence
is a structural deformity due to anatomic disruption of the
sphincter mechanism, which may be caused by obstetric injuries
(perineal laceration and improperly performed median
episiotomies), complications of fistula or fissure surgery
(keyhole deformities), traumatic injuries (e.g., impalement
injuries), or cancer. Alternatively, anorectal incontinence
may result from deterioration of the sphincter muscles due to
age, congenital disorders, systemic and metabolic diseases,
acquired neurological defects, and diseases of the colon and
rectum.Present treatment modalities for anorectal
incontinence include nonsurgical and surgical therapy.
Nonsurgical therapy for incontinence must be
