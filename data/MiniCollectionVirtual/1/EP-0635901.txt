<ABSTRACT>
In order to connect an electrical cable (12) electrically and in a sealed manner to a terminal element (10), such as an electrical contact, it is proposed to insert the partially stripped end of the cable into a stepped blind bore (26) formed in a rear connecting part (10b) of the element (10). More specifically, the stripped end of the cable is received in two cylindrical portions (26a, 26b) of the bore (26), into which portions have been inserted beforehand a transparent sleeve (30) closing off an inspection hole (32), and a metal interface ring (34). The non-stripped part of the cable is received in a cylindrical entrance portion (26c) of the bore (26). Next, the partially frustoconical external surface of the part (10b) is deformed, by wire-type drawing, in order to give it a cylindrical shape.

Process for the connection of an electric cable (12) to an 
end member (10), whose rear connection portion (10b) has a blind 

hole (26) and an outer surface having at least one truncated 
cone-shaped portion (24), whose diameter increases towards an 

open end of the hole, in which: the cable (12) is introduced 
into the blind hole (26) and the rear connection portion (10b) 

is radially compacted to give the outer surface a cylindrical 
shape, characterized in that: 


use is made of a cable (12) having a core (14) covered with an 
insulating sheath (16), 
the cable is bared over a length smaller than that of 
the blind hole (26), 
the cable is introduced into a stepped blind hole (26) formed 
from at least two cylindrical sections (26a, 26b, 26c), each 

having a chamfered entrance end (28a, 28b, 28c), so that an 
unbared portion of the cable is received in an entrance section 

(26e) of the hole, the truncated cone-shaped portion (24) of the 
outer surface being located around the entrance section (26c) 

and at least one other section of the hole (26) and 
radial compaction takes place of the rear connection portion 
of the end member (10) by wiredrawing, whilst exerting a 

tension on said member, so as to pass the rear connection portion 
into a calibrated die (40). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that use is made 
of an end member (10) having at least one inspection hole (32) 

issuing into a bottom section (26a) of the blind hole and, before 
introducing the cable (12) into said blind hole, a transparent sealling 

sleeve (30) is placed in the bottom section. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that use is made 
of the inspection hole (32) for facilitating the treatment of the  

 
interior of the blind hole (26), prior to the positioning there of 

the transparent sealing sleeve (30). 
Process according to either of the claims 2 and 3, characterized 
in that, after placing the transparent sealing sleeve (30) 

in the bottom section (26a) and before introducing the cable (12) 
into the blind hole (26), an interface ring (34) made from an 

electrically conductive material is placed in an intermediate 
section (26b) of the blind hole. 
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that use is made 
of an interface ring (34), chamfered towards the inside at its ends. 
End member fitted, by radial compacting, onto the end of an 
electric cable (12), said member having a front portion (10a) 

and a rear connection portion (10b), the latter having a blind hole 
(26) receiving one end of the cable, and an outer surface having 

at least one truncated cone-shaped portion (24), whose diameter 
increases towards an open end of the blind hole, characterized in 

that the end member is to be fitted onto the end of a cable (12) 
having a core (14) covered with an insulating sheath (16) and bared 

over a length smaller than that of the blind hole (26), the latter 
being stepped and formed from at least two cylindrical sections 

(26a, 26b, 26e) of the hole receiving an unbared portion of the 
cable, the truncated cone-shaped portion (24) of the outer surface 

being located around the entrance section and at least one other 
section of the hole, and the front portion (10a) has a shoulder 

(20) turned towards the rear connection portion (10b) and able to 
serve as an anchoring means for the tension device for the radial 

compacting of the rear connection portion by wiredrawing. 
End member according to claim 6, characterized in that at least 
one inspection hole (32) issues into a bottom section (26a) of the 

blind hole and a transparent sealing sleeve (30) is placed in said 
bottom section.  

 
End member according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
blind hole also has an intermediate section (26b) in which is 

placed an interface ring (34) made from an electrically conductive 
material. 
End member according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
ends of the interface ring (34) are chamfered towards the inside 

and the internal diameter of said ring is slightly smaller than 
the internal diameter of the transparent sealing sleeve (30). 
End member according to either of the claims 8 and 9, 
characterized in that the outer surface has a cylindrical portion 

(22) mainly surrounding the bottom section (26a) of the hole and 
a truncated cone-shaped portion (24) mainly surrounding the 

intermediate section and entrance section of the hole.
