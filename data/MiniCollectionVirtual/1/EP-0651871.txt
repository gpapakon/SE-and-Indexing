<DESCRIPTION>
 PNEUMATIC LIGHTING APPARATUSBackground of the Invention1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to lighting devices and, more particularly, to a pneumatic lighting apparatus for use with a pneumatic tool, or to a tool constructed with a pneumatic lighting apparatus for illuminating a work area in which the tool is to be used.2. Discussion of the Prior ArtIn many manufacturing and industrial maintenance settings, pneumatic tools are used to construct and repair products. In these settings, frequently a worker is required to access a small, hard to reach place that is out of the line of normal illumination of conventional manufacturing area lighting. It is common for the worker to carry a DC or AC powered, hand-held light in order to provide additional lighting of the iÏ€imediate work area.However, because conventional lighting devices typically must be hand-held, the worker may quickly become tied up between handling the tool and the light while also positioning himself and the work piece in a proper orientation. Further, because pneumatic power is already commonly available in the work place for use in powering the tools typically used, the provision of a separate DC or AC power source in addition to the pneumatic lines already present represents unnecessary duplication of power lines in the work area which inhibits movement of workers and reduces their efficiency.Another disadvantage to using most presently available DC powered lighting devices is environmental in nature, and relates to the problem of disposal of batteries and the like which are used to supply the 

power for such devices. It would be desirable to provide a lighting apparatus that does not adversely effect the environment and that is powered by already available pneumatic means typically present in a manufacturing or maintenance environment. Objects and Summary of the InventionIt is an object of the present invention to provide a lighting apparatus which can be used in association with pneumatic tools in order to provide focused light onto the immediate area surrounding the point at which work is being done or at which a tool is directed, wherein the lighting apparatus is powered by the same pneumatic energy used to power the tools.It is another object of the invention to provide a lighting apparatus that is pneumatically driven, and which includes ventilation means for selectively directing exhausted air from the apparatus into a desired region in which a worker is disposed.Yet another object of the invention
