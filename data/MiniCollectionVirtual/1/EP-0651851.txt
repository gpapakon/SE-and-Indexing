<ABSTRACT>
A three dimensional cellular shade (20) attached to a roller (21). The cells (28) of the shade (20) expand outward as the shade (20) is unrolled. The shade (20) is made from two sheets of fabric (22, 24). One of the fabrics (24) is decorative. The other fabric (22) is more functional. The decorative fabric (24) is longer in length than the functional fabric (22). The two fabrics (22, 24) are joined together along a plurality of joints (26) extending down the length of the shade (20). These joints (26) are uniformly displaced from one another. The ratio of decorative fabric (24) to functional fabric (22) between any two joints (26) is greater than one. This ratio is important for ensuring that the cells will expand outward as the shade (20) is unrolled.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CELLULAR SHADEField of the Invention This invention relates to the field of window coverings - more specifically, window coverings with a cellular structure.Discussion of the Related Art Cellular shades are well known in the art. A cellular shade, is a shade that, when expanded, has air pockets trapped within its body. This type of shade construction offers several advantages. A cellular shade can be made to insulate windows. The cells of honeycomb cellular shades hide the strings that operate the shade, an improvement over pleated shades. Cellular shades also have enhanced depth of color. The most popular cellular shade is a honeycomb cellular shade. This type of shade is raised and lowered by strings attached to a bottom rail. Another, cellular shade is rolled up on a roller. This type of shade is flat on both its front and back faces. A typical honeycomb cellular shade is constructed of a plurality of hollow slats or tubes, stacked and then adhered to one another, to form a three-dimensional cellular structure when expanded. In its unexpanded state, the slats or tubes flatten to form a rectangular stack. The height of the stack is dependent on the length of the shade and the material it is made from. An example of this 

type of cellular shade is shown in U.S. Patent 4,019,554 to Rasmussen.A typical cellular shade that is rolled up has a structure that includes two or more sheets that are separated from one another by a vane. The vanes define the top and the bottom of each cell and the sheets define the sidewalls. The vane is attached to one or both of the sheets. As mentioned, the shade is generally rolled up on a roller. The roller raises, lowers and operates the vanes of the shade if the vane is attached to both sheets. The two sheets are flat. To roll up the shade, first the vanes are slanted to bring the flat sheets together, then once together, the shade rolls up like a typical roller shade. An example of this type of shade is shown in U.S. Patent 3,384,519 to Froget. Another example of this shade is sold under the trademark SILHOUETTEÂ® by Hunter-Douglas Inc. of Broomfield, Co.Cellular roman shades are known in the art. The advantages of a cellular roman shade are the soft, luxurious appearance of the roman shade, combined with the functional attributes of a cellular shade. All cellular roman shades made to date have used cellular honeycomb technology. Instead of creasing both edges of the cell as is done in a typical honeycomb cellular shade, only one edge is creased and the other is left to

[received by the International Bureau on 3 October 1994 (03.10.94); original claims 1 and 2 cancelled; new claims 1-30 added; (5 pages)]
1. An article for light and vision control comprising: a first sheet of material that has a first length and a first width, a second sheet of material that has a second length and a second width, said second length being greater than said first length, said second sheet being secured to said first sheet along narrow joints extending across the width of said first sheet to form a plurality of spaced apart joints along said first length of said first sheet, the ratio of spacing between any two adjacent joints on said second sheet to the spacing between any two adjacent joints on said first sheet being greater than one, and a roller to which said first and second sheets are operatively coupled, said roller being adapted to rotatably collect said covering from a lowered to a raised position and vice versa.
2. An article according to claim 1, wherein the spacing between any two of said joints on said first sheet is unequal to any one of the following values: a. an even number divisor of its roll circumference, b. its exact roll circumference, and c. an even number multiple of its roll circumference.
3. An article according to claim 1, wherein the relationship of the spacing between adjacent joints on said first sheet and the circumference of the roller is such that any accumulated integer of spacing intervals of said first material between joints on said roller differs from any integer multiple of said roll circumference. 


 4. An article according to claim 1, wherein said first sheet is made of a substantailly translucent material.
5. An article according to claim 1, wherein said first sheet is made of a polyester material.
6. An article according to claim 1, wherein said second sheet is made of hydrophobic material.
7. An article according to claim 1, wherein said second sheet is made of polyester fabric. 8. An article according to claim 1, wherein said second sheet is resistant to permanent creases when rolled on said roller.
9. An article according to claim 1, wherein said narrow joints are lines of adhesive. 10. An article according to claim 1, wherein the first and second sheets are wrapped around said roller with the second sheet outermost on the roll.
11. An article according to claim 1, wherein the second width is smaller than the first width and the article has a plurality of individual second sheets across the first width of said first sheet and attached side by side to said first sheet (Fig. 13).
