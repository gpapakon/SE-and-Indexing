A process for preparing 3-(p-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-propionic
acid and derivatives thereof of the

formula (I),


in which R is a hydroxy group, a linear or branched
(C
1
-C
8
)-alkoxy group, an aryloxy group, an amino
group or a (C
1
-C
8
) -alkylamino group or a (C
1
-C
8
)-dialkylamino
group, which process comprises


a) converting p-fluoroaniline into the p-fluorophenyldiasonium
salt of the formula (II)



in which X is the equivalent of an anion of an
organic or inorganic acid having a pKa value of

less than 7,
b) reacting the diazonium salt of the formula (II)
with a methacrylic acid derivative of the formula

(III) 


in which R is as defined above in the presence of
a palladium catalyst, if desired in the presence

of a base and/or a solvent, disclaiming the use
of a carboxylic acid, to give the compounds of

the formulae (IV) and (V) in which R is as
defined above,



and
c) hydrogenating the resulting compounds of the
formulae (IV) and (V) in the presence of a

palladium catalyst with hydrogen.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein step a)
and step b) are carried out as a one-pot reaction.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
reaction with the methacrylic acid derivative of the

formula (III) is carried out at temperatures of 0 to
120°C, in particular 20 to 100°C, preferably 30 to

80°C.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 3, wherein for step b) the palladium catalyst is

used in heterogeneous form. 
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
palladium catalyst is used on a support, in particular

activated carbon, calcium carbonate, barium
sulfate, pumice, clay, kieselguhr, silica gel,

graphite, magnesium oxide and/or alumina, preferably
activated carbon.
The process as claimed in claim 4, wherein palladium
bis(benzylidene)acetone compounds are used in

heterogeneous form.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 6, wherein in step b) 0.001 to 1 mol%, in particular

0.01 to 0.8 mol%, of palladium, relative to
the diazonium salt, is used.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 7, wherein in step b) 1 mol of diazonium salt is

reacted with 0.8 to 20 mol, in particular 1 to
5 mol, of methacrylic acid derivative.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 8, wherein in step b) the solvent used is water,

methanol, ethanol or mixtures thereof.
