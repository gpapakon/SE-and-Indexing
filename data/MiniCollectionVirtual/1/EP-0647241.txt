<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a process for preparing a procatalyst composition suitable for the polymerization of ethene and other (alpha)-olefins, which comprises the steps of: (a) contacting an inorganic oxide carrier, having a low content of surface hydroxyls, with an impregnation solution containing a magnesium compound, an alcohol, and a tetravalent titanium compound, (b) chlorinating the contacted inorganic oxide carrier with a chlorinating agent, and (c) recovering the chlorination product to yield the procatalyst composition. Prior similar processes have the disadvantage of using polar solvents of low volatility and titanium tetrachloride as the source of active centers. Both materials make the process more difficult and contaminate its product. These problems have now been solved in such a manner that the impregnation solution comprises a magnesium alkoxide, a titanium alkoxide and a lower alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to process for preparing a procatalyst
composition suitable for the polymerization of ethene and
other α-olefins, which comprises the steps of:
a) contacting an inorganic oxide carrier, having its surface hydroxyl content
lowered by calcination at 600 - 1000°C or by reaction
with a hydroxyl removing agent, with an impregnation solution
consisting of a magnesium compound, an alcohol, a tetravalent
titanium compound and optionally a hydrocarbon solvent,b) chlorinating the contacted inorganic oxide carrier with a
chlorinating agent, andc) recovering the chlorination product to yield the procatalyst
composition, 
characterized in that the magnesium compound is a magnesium alkoxide of the
formula Mg(OR)2 wherein the groups can be different or similar alkyl groups, the
tetravalent titanium compound is a titanium alkoxide and the alcohol is an alcohol
of the formula R2OH wherein R2 is a C1-C8 alkyl group.In one aspect the invention relates to a procatalyst composition
made by such a process and in another aspect the invention
relates to the use of such a procatalyst composition
for the polymerization of ethene and other α-olefins.Olefins are traditionally polymerized (i.e. homo- and copolymerized)
by a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system, which consists
of a so-called procatalyst and a so-called cocatalyst.
The procatalyst is based on a compound of a transition metal
belonging to any of groups IVA-VIII (Hubbard) of the periodic
table of the elements and the cocatalyst is based on an
organometallic compound of a metal belonging to any of
groups I(A)-III (Hubbard) of the periodic table of the elements.
The catalyst system often also includes a solid procatalyst
carrier as well as electron donors which improve
and modify the catalytic properties of the system.The catalytic activity of the procatalyst is greatly enhanced
by carriers like the magnesium halides, alkoxides,
hydroxides and oxides, titanium dioxide, aluminium oxide and 
silica. In the case of silica, the carrier is usually first
treated thermically and/or chemically to remove at least a
part of its surface hydroxyl groups. Then the pretreated
solid carrier is often treated with one or more liquids
which contain a surface modifying magnesium compound, an
electron donor/solvent like tetrahydrofuran or butanol, a
titanium compound, and, finally, a chlorinating agent.Such procatalysts and their preparation processes are disclosed,
among others, in FI patents 70417, 70418 and 78113,
