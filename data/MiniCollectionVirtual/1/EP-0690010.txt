<ABSTRACT>
A collapsible container of a kind used as an 
intermediate bulk container, particularly for carriage of 

hazardous materials. The container has a base (10) on which 
are placed sides (12) and a front gate (11) and a rear gate 

(not shown in Figure 1). The lid of the container sits 
flush between the top edges of the frameworks which 

constitute the sides and front and rear gates. A feature 
of the invention is that the front and rear gates are 

attached to the sides by means of U-shaped brackets (40) 

which are welded to the vertical members (41) of the side 
frames (12). A bolt (47) passes through aligned holes in the 

two ends of the U-shaped brackets and in the vertical side 
members of the gates and sides of the container. Further 

features include a strengthened base, upstanding lugs to 
support a second container stacked on the first, and 

modifications to prevent the nozzles for filling and 
emptying a plastic bag, to be placed in the container, from 

splitting from the bag when the container is mishandled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a collapsible container
particularly of the kind which may be used as an
intermediate bulk container and particularly adapted for
the carriage of hazardous materials.While the container of this invention may be used for
hazardous materials, it is not so limited and may also be
used for non-hazardous materials.When hazardous materials, such as acids in liquid
form, caustic materials and dangerous chemicals in liquid
form, are carried in intermediate bulk containers in
plastic bags, the containers have to be capable or meeting
the requirements of the test for hazardous materials set
out in B.S. 6939. One test, applied to the type of intermediate bulk
container which has a liner within which is placed a
plastic bag containing hazardous liquids, is that the
contents have to be reduced to -18Â°C and held at that
temperature, but kept liquid if necessary by the use of
anti-freeze, and then the intermediate bulk container has
to be dropped from a height of 1.2 metres fully loaded with
minimal spillage of the liquid within the plastic bag. The
container in accordance with the present invention is
designed to pass that test even when the container is
dropped onto its face which normally includes the gate
through which liquid is emptied from the plastic bag.In accordance with the present invention, there is
provided a collapsible container comprising:
a base,two side panels,a front panel,a rear panel, anda top panel, or lid,the panels being easily attachable to and detachable
from the base, each panel comprising a braced metal
framework,in which the upper surface of the framework of the top
panel is arranged to lie flush with the upper surfaces of
the framework of the side, front and rear panels whereby
the top panel or lid is located within the interior of the
container, the top panel being located in position by 
brackets which engage the upper framework members of the
side, front and rear panels and being retained in position
by bolts.In the accompanying drawings:-

container constructed in accordance with the present
invention;Figure 2 is an isometric view of the lid when removed
from the box and stood on one side;Figure 3 is an isometric view of the base of the
container;Figures 3a, b and c show base details;Figure 4 is an isometric view of the front panel or
