<ABSTRACT>
A valve device comprises a vertical, tubular housing 1, a 
vertical valve member 2 in the housing 1, and a coil-form 

compression spring 7 encircling the member 2 and urging it 
upwardly against a valve seat 9 in the housing lower end. The 

member 2 includes an upper, obturating portion 5 and a lower, 
closure portion 3 and its internal surface includes an upper 

annular part which diverges downwardly at a gradually increasing 
angle away from the location of the obturating portion 5 in the 

valve closed condition. The internal surface includes a lower 
annular part 13 converging downwardly at a substantial angle to 

the housing axis and situated directed radially outwards of the 
spring 7. Below the seat 9 is an outlet mouth encirculed by a 

rim 20, the closure part 3 having a bottom lip 19 at such 
clearance relative to the rim 20 that, shortly before the closure 

part 3 seals against the seat 9, the rim 20 and the lip 19 act 
shearingly upon liquid therebetween. The member 2 includes three 

guiding fins 6 in sliding contact with the internal surface. The 
seat 9 may consist of moulded-in elastomeric material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve device for controlling liquid 
flow, in particular for use in filling a carton. Various valve devices for filling containers are known. French 
Patent Application Publication No. 2299628 and United States 
Patents 3949791 and 4079762 disclose a variety of possible 
constructions of such devices. Published British Patent Specification 2043604A discloses a 
filling valve device for pressurized fluids which comprises a 
nozzle containing a stem axially displaceable downwardly under 
the thrust of the fluid against the bias of a helical spring 
closely encircling the stem. The stem carries an obturating dish 
at the top and a valve closure head at the bottom, the dish 
dividing the nozzle interior into two spaces, one communicating 
with a source of pressurized fluid, the other communicating with 
the interior of the container to be filled whenever the valve 
closure head is depressed. Contact of the fluid with air exterior to the nozzle is prevented 
and possible foam formation is discharged through an axial 
passageway formed through the stem and through an elbow conduit 
coaxial with the stem axis and aligned with the central bore of 
the stem. The spring acts between the underside of the dish and 
the top of a horizontal spider mounted in the interior of the 
nozzle, the spider being composed of a central, stem-guiding ring 
having radial spokes which rest against a step formed in the 
internal surface of the nozzle. Below the spider, the internal 
surface of the nozzle converges downwardly at a substantial angle 
to the nozzle axis. In the open condition of the valve device, 
the liquid flows down through between the obturating dish and the  
 
internal surface, past the outside of the spring, and through the 
spokes of the spider. The valve head, which protrudes downwardly 
from the outlet end of the nozzle, carries a gasket for bearing 
upwardly against that outlet end to seal the same. A problem with this device is that the close encircling of the 
stem by the spring and the use of a spider and a sealing gasket 
provide crevices where solids content can accumulate and be very 
difficult to remove by flushing of the device. Published European Patent Application 0090664 discloses a valve 
device for use in filling cartons, which includes a metal tubular 
housing containing a metal valve member comprising a closure part 
co-operating with a metal valve seat at the lower extremity of 
the housing, and a driving part movably received with clearance 
in the housing. In

<CLAIMS>
A valve device for controlling liquid flow, comprising 
a tubular housing (1), an annular valve seat (9) on said 

housing (1) and substantially co-axial therewith and 
bounding an internal surface of said housing (1), and a 

valve member (2) including a valve closure portion (3) and 
extending substantially co-axially in said housing (1) and 

movable relative to said housing (1) downwardly axially 
thereof from a closed condition in which said closure 

portion (3) acts sealingly against said valve seat (9) round 
an annulus of sealing to an open condition in which said 

closure portion (3) is spaced from said valve seat (9), said 
housing (1) having a bottom outlet mouth encircled by an 

annular rim (20), and said closure portion (3) having an 
annular bottom lip (19) characterized in that said annular 

bottom lip (19) is arranged with such clearance relative to 
said annular rim (20) that, shortly before said closure 

portion (3) acts sealingly against said valve seat (9) 
during the closing movement of said valve member (2), said 

annular rim (20) and said bottom lip (19) act shearingly 
upon liquid between said annular rim (20) and said bottom 

lip (19). 
A valve device according to claim 1, wherein said 
clearance is less than 0.5mm, particularly is less than 

0.3mm, preferably between 0.1 and 0.2mm. 
A valve device for controlling liquid flow, comprising 
a tubular housing (1), a valve member (2) extending 

substantially co-axially in said housing (1) and movable 
relative to said housing (1) and axially thereof between an 

open condition in which liquid can flow between said valve 
member (2) and said housing (1) and a closed condition, and 

a coil-form compression spring (7) disposed substantially 
co-axially in said housing (1) and urging said valve member 

(2) in said closed condition, said valve member (2) 
including an obturating portion (5) which, in said closed 

condition, substantially obturates said tubular housing (1) 
at a first location and which substantially closes a nearer

location at a substantial angle to the axis of the housing 

(1), characterized in that said annular surface zone (13) is 
situated directly radially outwards of said spring (7), and 

said internal surface extends to the further end of said 
spring (7) and there bears said further end. 
A valve device according to claim 3, wherein said 
substantial angle is between 40° and 60°. 
A valve device for controlling liquid flow, comprising a 
tubular housing (1), an annular valve seat (9) on said 

housing (1) and substantially co-axial therewith and

seat (9), characterized in that one of said valve seat (9) 
and said closure portion (3) comprises elastomeric material 

(21) moulded into a recess (22) in metal and arranged to
