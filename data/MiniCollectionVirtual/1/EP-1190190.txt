<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shifting device for an automobile gearbox, comprising the following: a selector lever (1) for selecting different shifting positions (P, R, N, D, 3, 2,  ), said lever being mounted in a housing (3) in such a way that it can pivot about at least one pin (2);  a first blocking member (4) and at least one other blocking member (5) which block the movement of the selector lever (1) in different shifting positions; an actuator (6); and a blocking element (7) which is provided on the selector lever (1) and in which one of the blocking members (4, 5) engages in the shifting positions of the selector lever to be blocked, respectively, in accordance with predetermined parameters. The blocking members (4, 5) are configured in the form of elbow levers which are mounted on a housing (3) in such way that they can each pivot about a pivot pin (8, 9).

Gear shift apparatus for a motor vehicle transmission,
comprising:


a selector lever (1) for selecting different shift
positions (P, R, N, D, 3, 2, ...), which is mounted in a

housing (3) pivotally about at least one axle (2),
a first blocking member (4) and at least one further
blocking member (5), which block the movement of the

selector lever (1) in different shift positions and
which are mounted on the housing (3) in each case

pivotally about a swivelling axle (8, 9),
an actuator (6), as well as
a blocking element (7), which is provided on the
selector lever (1) and into which in dependence upon

preset parameters in the shift positions of the
selector lever that are to be blocked in each case one

of the blocking members (4, 5) engages,
characterized in that

the blocking members (4, 5) are designed as angle
levers, which each have two arms (14, 15), which

between them include an opening angle α, wherein
0° 
<
 α 
<
 180°, and in the connecting portion of which
a pivot bearing (16) is provided, and that the

actuator (6) is coupled to the blocking members (4,
5).
Gear shift apparatus according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the blocking members (4, 5) on their side facing the
blocking element (7) have a raised engagement contour 

(10), which is engageable into an approximately
complementary recess (11) of the blocking element (7).
Gear shift apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

the blocking element (7) has sliding faces (12, 13)
for facilitating the insertion and/or removal

movements of the blocking members (4, 5).
Gear shift apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

the selector lever (1) has a bow-shaped portion (17),
on the external contour of which at least at one end

at least one blocking element (7) is fastened.
Gear shift apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

the blocking members (4, 5) are identical components.
Gear shift apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

the actuator (6) is an electromagnet having an
armature (6.3), which is extendable in axial direction

from both ends of its housing (6.1) and biased by
means of a spring (6.2).
Gear shift apparatus according to claim 6,
characterized in that

the electromagnet (6) in the non-energized state has a
unilaterally extended armature (6.3), so that in the 

shift position "P" of the gear shift apparatus the
blocking member (5) and the blocking element (7) are

in mutual engagement.
Gear shift apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that

the gear shift apparatus is of an entirely modular
construction in the manner of a unitized construction

system.
