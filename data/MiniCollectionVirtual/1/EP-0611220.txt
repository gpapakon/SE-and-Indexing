<ABSTRACT>
A transport installation on a separate road bed includes track sections 21, 22 of different length or different throughput rate, each being equipped with a hauling cable 23, 24, 25 for moving the vehicles 18 over the corresponding section of track. The vehicle is coupled in succession to different cables and each cable accelerates it, moves it, slows it down and brings it to rest at a station where the change of cable takes place. The longest track sections or section 22 are equipped with two or several hauling cables for simultaneously moving several vehicles over this track section.

Transport installation with passive vehicles (18) comprising 
a track (10) whereon the vehicles run, stations (11,12,13) 

spaced apart along the track and defining successive track 
sections (21,22), traction cables (23,24,25) for hauling the 

vehicles (18) coupled at the cables, each track section (21,22) 
having at least one traction cable for driving the vehicles 

along said track section and for stopping them at the station, 
where they are uncoupled from the traction cable, for coupling 

to the traction cable of the successive track section and a 
motor group (31) associated to each traction cable, 

characterized in that only one vehicle (18) or train of 
vehicles is, at the same time, coupled to a traction cable 

(23,24,25), that the stopping of the vehicle at the station is 
provided by stopping the associated traction cable and that one 

track section (22) is equipped with two or more independent 
traction cables (24,25) to double or to multiply the transport 

capacity of that track section. 
Installation of claim 1, characterized in that the stations 
(11,12,13) are spaced apart along the track (10) and that the 

track section (22) of the greatest length or of the smallest 
capacity is equipped with at least two traction cables (24,25) 

so as to increase the capacity of the installation. 
Installation of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that each 
traction cable (23,24,25) is constituted by a cable loop which 

passes over end wheels (26) at the two stations (11,12,13) 
delimiting the corresponding track section. 
Installation of claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the 
track section (22) with two or more traction cables (24,25) 

comprises means (33) for measuring and for providing signals 
representative of the position of the vehicle (18) on the track 

and a central unit (30) receiving said signals and providing an 
alarm or stopping signal when two vehicles risk to collide.  

 
Installation of claim 4, characterized in that the central 
unit (30) associates to each vehicle (18) a theoretical 

protective zone which moves together with the vehicle and 
provides said alarm or stopping signal when the successive 

vehicle enters within said protective zone. 
Installation of claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the size 
of said protective zone depends from the speed of the 

successive vehicle and corresponds to the braking distance of 
that vehicle. 
Installation of claim 4, 5 or 6, characterized in that the 
central unit (30) controls the motor groups (31) of the other 

traction cables (23,24,25) so that the entrance of a vehicle 
and stopping at the station substantially corresponds with the 

stopping of the traction cable of the successive section. 
Installation of claim 1, characterized in that at the 
station (11,12,13) the traction cable (23,24,25) ends overlap 

and are laterally spaced one with respect to the other and that 
each vehicle (18) comprises a grip device (27,28,29) for 

coupling to any one of the traction cables. 
Installation of claim 8, characterized in that the vehicle 
(18) comprises at least two laterally spaced grips having a 

locking device preventing the closing of the two grips at the 
same time. 
Installation of claim 8, characterized in that the vehicle 
(18) comprises one grip being movable laterally to cooperate 

with any one of the traction cables (23,24,25) at the staion.
