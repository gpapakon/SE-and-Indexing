in the manufacturing industry, especially from polymerization operations 

and thermoplastic polymer processing operations which has a 
plurality of ducts, an entrance for collecting air, containing the 

emissions and an exit for exiting exhaust air, a first heat 
exchanger (15) which has a hot side with an entrance (16) 

and an exit (17) and a 
cold side with an entrance (18) and an exit (19), a second heat exchanger 

(23), which has a hot side with an entrance (24) 
and an exit (25) and a cold side, 

a liquid removal system, and a fan (34), whereby the first heat 
exchanger is connected with the entrance of the hot side to the 

entrance of the duct system and with the exit of the hot side to 
the entrance of the hot side of the second heat exchanger by a 

duct; the exit of the hot side of the second heat exchanger is 
connected to the entrance of the cool side (18) of the first heat 

exchanger (15) by a duct; the precipitator (30) 
is connected to the exit of 

the cool side of the first heat exchanger by a duct and to the fan (34) 
by a duct, the fan is connected to the exit of the duct system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and a process for 
removing emissions, originated in the manufacturing industry like 
the chemical, pharmaceutical, coatings, recycling and oil industry. 
Especially, it relates to a process which is suitable for removing 
monomer, oligomer, additives and water emissions before, during and 
after the polymerization reaction for the manufacture of 
thermoplastic polymers and during thermoplastic polymer processing 
operations like extrusion, injection molding and fiber spinning 
operations. In the manufacturing industry, like the chemical, pharmaceutical, 
coating, recycling and oil industry, there exists a broad variety 
of sources for emissions which are released in the environment, 
which is not desirable. For example, in chemical reactions, 
emissions of reaction components, additives and solvents may be 
released. During coating of cars, vapors of coatings, additives 
and solvents may be released. During recycling of polymers , 
monomers or oligomers of the hydrolyzed polymer may be released. 
During cleaning of reactors, chemicals and solvents may be 
released. Before, during and after the polymerization reaction for the  
 
manufacture of thermoplastic polymers like polyamides, polyester, 
polyolefins, polycarbonates, polystyrenes, polyacrylonitriles, 
polyurethanes, polysulfones, polyethysulfones, polyvinylchloride, 
copolymers and mixtures thereof, monomer vapors may be released in 
the environment from transportation tanks, storage tanks, 
pipelines, ducts, polymerization reactors, polymer melts, polymer 
strands, water bath, cutters, dryers and the like. During 
thermoplastic polymer processing like injection molding or 
extrusion, the thermoplastic polymers are for example extruded 
through an extruder into strands for chip production or into films, 
fibers, profiles, tubes and the like. During the extrusion at a 
temperature of from about 180 to about 350Â°C, monomer or oligomer 
vapors, compounds formed by thermal evaporation, thermal 
decomposition, or vapors of additives are released from the surface 
of the extruded polymers, which are leaving the nozzle of the 
extruder. These vapors evaporate immediately into an aerosol that 
would form deposits in the neighborhood of the extruder and 
therefore, must be removed, which is usually done by the quench air 
removal. The exhaust air is usually released in the environment, 
which is not desirable. During the manufacture of synthetic yarns, a heat setting step is 
applied to the yarn for
