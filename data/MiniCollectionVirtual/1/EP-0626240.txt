<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the hardening of wood 
material by impregnating it with a polymerizable substance and 

by polymerizing the polymerizable substance by means of heat. 
Heat transfer and cleaning in the polymerization have been 

improved through the impregnated wood material being in contact 
with water during the polymerization. The water is preferably 

hot and pressurized and serves at the beginning of the polymerization 
as a heating medium and during the polymerization as a 

cooling and cleaning medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for hardening wood material
by impregnating it with a polymerizable substance and by polymerizing
the polymerizable substance by means of heat.The technological use of a number of species of timber is limited
by their inherent softness. The softness of wood, as well
as its other mechanical strength properties, is derived from
the microstructure of the wood, which is different in different
species of timber. All species of timber are composed mainly of
hollow cells parallel to the direction of the trunk, i.e. of
wood fibers, of which both the size and the structure vary.
Roughly it can be said that the larger the cell lumens in proportion
to the cell size, the softer and weaker the wood.Without dealing in greater detail with the formation of the
inherent properties of wood it can, however, be stated that the
growth of the cell tissue is affected by, for example, the
hereditary factors of the wood, the water and nutritional situation
in the soil, and the climate during the growth period. A
major proportion of the wood available globally consists of
these so-called soft species of timber, and in most cases they
have only lower-value use. This is, of course, seen in the
commercial uses and prices of species of timber.Uses in which especially the hardness of wood is important
include various surface materials in buildings, such as floor
and table surfaces. Among the Finnish species of timber, only
the birch competes in terms of its hardness on a par with
foreign species, such as oak, beech, elm, etc.The hardness of wood can best be affected by filling the empty
spaces in the cell tissue with a solid. The filling can be done
by impregnating the wood in a closed space with a liquid which 
can be hardened inside the wood, for example by polymerization.
One problem is how to cause the liquid to penetrate evenly into
the cell tissue of the wood, since the permeability of most
species of timber is poor and may vary significantly in various
parts of the timber. For this reason, poorly impregnable wood
is treated with an impregnation liquid in a closed space by
using vacuum and/or pressure. Another problem is to cause the
impregnating substances to polymerize inside the wood so that
the wood is not burned or split, or does not lose properties
important for its technological uses, such as its capability of
being sanded, machined, glued or its surface being treated.Substances intended for the impregnation of wood are often
polymerized by using heat. The reaction is exothermal and
usual
