<ABSTRACT>
A multiple layer printed circuit board (60) and a method of manufacturing multiple layer printed circuit boards (60) which incorporate integral edge shielding in combination with top and bottom shielding to effectively provide a sandwich arrangement within a Faraday Cage. Electromagnetic emissions radiating from an outside surface of either the top or bottom shielding layer are substantially reduced. In one structure, a multiple layer printed circuit board having a sandwich arrangement which includes at least one inner conductive layer (70) for providing a ground plane disposed between the outer shielding layers, the inner conductive layer (70) being electrically connected directly to the edge shielding means and hence to the outer conductive layers (20, 22). The larger and more continuous surface area provided by the direct connection to the edge shielding effectively provides an electrical connection having a low inductance and hence in operation results in all ground planes having a more constant non-varying potential.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multiple layer printed 
circuit boards. Printed circuit boards have evolved from having 
signal layers as top and/or bottom layers to structures 
having a plurality of signal layers sandwiched with 
insulating layers interleaved between the signal layers. 
Printed circuit board manufacturers often provide a 
plurality of metal layers internally disposed within the 
structure and insulated from signal layers for connection 
to power or ground. The signal and metal layers do not 
extend out to the edge of the finished printed circuit 
board but fall short by a predetermined distance. Thus a 
small three dimensional unobstructed space around the 
perimeter of the finished printed circuit board is made 
available for mechanical fasteners to fasten faceplates and 
printed circuit board stiffeners to the printed circuit 
board. In operation, when the metal layers are connected 
to power or ground they are referred to as power or ground 
planes respectively. Power and ground planes provide a 
convenient way for designers using this technology to 
connect, where required power and/or ground to electronic 
components mounted on an outermost surface of the multiple 
layer printed circuit board and which have leads which are 
soldered within Plated-through holes extending through the 
structure. Signal layers which are disposed next to but 
insulated from a ground plane layer can also take advantage 
of well known microstrip or stripline techniques which 
permit engineers to control the impedance characteristics 
of critical signal tracks located on the signal layer. 
Multiple layer printed circuit boards having in the order 
of ten layers are now common place within the 
telecommunication industry. Along with this advancement in printed circuit 
board technology, logic families have been developed which 
are orders of magnitude faster in operation than their  
 
predecessors. Integrated circuits which operate at these 
higher speeds, take less time to switch from a logic zero 
to a logic one (rise time) and from a logic one to a logic 
zero (fall time). It is well known within the electronic 
industry that there is a direct correlation between the 
time taken by integrated circuits to switch from one logic 
state to the other and the magnitude of electromagnetic 
emissions radiated from the associated signal tracking 
layer. Simply stated, faster switching times inherently 
mean greater radiated electromagnetic emissions from the 
signal layers of printed circuit boards having integrated
