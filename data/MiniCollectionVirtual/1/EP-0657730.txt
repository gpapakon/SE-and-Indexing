<ABSTRACT>
Method for maceral analysis of coal on a sample consisting of ground coal coated in a resin, by exploring the surface of the sample using a microscope and by measuring the reflectance (reflective power) of vitrinite, characterised by the following steps:   - for each field of the microscope, a digitised image with grey levels is produced; - the fields with high resin content are eliminated by thresholding;     - for each field not eliminated:     a) the grey level distributions and the gradients are determined; b) a binary image is produced by thresholding the grey gradients so as to determine the vitrinite zones; c) the distribution of the grey levels or densitometry of the vitrinite zones obtained is determined; and   d) the reflectance of the vitrinite is calculated.

Process for the maceral analysis of coal with a
view to determining its vitrinite content, wherein a

sample is used consisting of ground coal coated in
resin, the surface of the sample is scanned using a

microscope by displacing the sample to obtain successive
fields in the microscope and the reflectance of the

vitrinite is measured, characterised by the following
steps:


for each field of the microscope, an image is
produced which is digitized in levels of grey;
on each image, a threshold measurement is taken
to eliminate fields containing a quantity of resin

exceeding a given threshold;
for each field which is not eliminated, the
following analysis is carried out:


a) the distribution of the levels of grey is
determined;
b) the gradients of the levels of grey are
determined;
c) a binary image is obtained by thresholding the
gradients of grey so as to determine the vitrinite

zones;
d) the distribution of the levels of grey or the
densitometry of the vitrinite zones obtained is

determined; and
e) the reflectance of the vitrinite is calculated.
Process for the maceral analysis of coal according
to claim 1, characterised in that the reflectan
ce of the
vitrinite is calculated by determining the mean level of

grey for all the vitrinite zones in the sample.
Process for the maceral analysis of coal according
to claim 1, characterised in that the reflectance of the

vitrinite is calculated by determining the mean level of 
grey of each vitrinite zone.
Process for the maceral analysis of coal according
to claim 1, characterised in that morphological

filtering by size is carried out to eliminate small-size
vitrinite zones before the step of measuring the

distribution of the levels of grey.
Process for the maceral analysis of coal according
to claim 1, characterised in that the reflectance values

of the vitrinite are obtained from the densitometry
values.
Process for the maceral analysis of coal according
to claim 1, characterised in that, for each field which

is not eliminated, a correction is made for each image
point using a reference image uniform in levels of grey.
Process for the maceral analysis of coal according
to claim 1, characterised in that the lighting of the

microscope is adjusted beforehand by means of a
calibrating surface of known reflectance.
Process for the maceral analysis of coal according
to claim 1, characterised in that after the reflectance

of the vitrinite has been calculated, the vitrinite
content is calculated and the content of the other

components is estimated by analysis of the densitometry
without vitrinite.
