<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radial-flow blower known per se which consists of a casing having a scroll-like (spiral-shaped, volute) inner profile and a closed blower rotor (impeller). The diameter of the blower rotor is very much larger than its flow outlet width, and the closed blower rotor consists of a supporting disc (1), a back disc (2) and recurved blades (vanes) (3) arranged between these. To make the known radial-flow blower suitable for use with low back pressures and large volume flows it is proposed that the outer blade edges be designed so as to run obliquely.

A radial fan, comprising a housing with a spiral-shaped
inner contour and a closed impeller, the diameter of

which is much greater than its flow outlet width (c) and
which consists of a supporting disk (1), a cover disk (2)

and rearwardly curved blades (3) arranged therebetween, the
blades (3) being constructed so as to taper from the inside

to the outside and the length thereof being greater at the
supporting disk (1) than at the cover disk (2),

characterised in that at least part of the outer blade edge
forms an acute angle with a line parallel to the axis of

rotation.
A radial fan according to claim 1,

characterised in that the outer blade edge takes the form
of an obtuse-angled triangle.
A radial fan according to claim 1,

characterised in that the outer blade edge takes the form
of a trapezium.
A radial fan according to claim 1,

characterised in that the outer blade edge takes the form
of a curve (8, 9).
A radial fan according to claim 1,

characterised in that the outer blade edge comprises an
oblique line (10, 11) extending between the ends of the

supporting disk (1) and the cover disk (2).
A radial fan according to claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that the obtuse-angled vertex of the
triangle takes the form of a rounded vertex (7).
A radial fan according to claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that the supporting disk (7) and the cover
disk (2) have different diameters. 
A radial fan according to claim 4,

characterised in that the curve (8,9) is of symmetrical
construction.
A radial fan according to claim 4,

characterised in that the curve (8,9) is of asymmetrical
construction.
