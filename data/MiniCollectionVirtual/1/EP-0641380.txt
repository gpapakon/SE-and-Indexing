A process for the production of detergents containing anionic
surfactants by granulation in a mixer, a solid being initially introduced into

the mixer, characterized by

(a) separate preparation of a mixture containing anionic surfactants,
which is flowable and pumpable up to at least 20°C, by partial

neutralization of one or more anionic surfactants in their acid form
with a basic inorganic or organic neutralization medium,
(b) addition of the mixture containing anionic surfactants to a solid or
solid mixture previously introduced into a mixer and
(c) granulation of the constituents to form pourable and free-flowing
granules,

an inorganic or organic neutralization medium being used in step (a) and
the solid initially introduced in step (b) being a basic solid or the solid

mixture in step (b) containing one or more basic solids and the basic solid
or basic solids being present in at least such quantities that complete

neutralization of the anionic surfactants in their acid form is guaranteed.
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the mixture
containing anionic surfactants is prepared in step (a) by neutralization of

one or more anionic surfactants in their acid form with a liquid, basic
organic neutralization medium, preferably an amine, more particularly

dimethylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine or
mixtures thereof.
A process as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the mixture
containing anionic surfactants is prepared in step (a) by the neutralization

of a natural C
8-18
 fatty acid mixture with monoethanolamine or triethanolamine,
the mixing ratio of anionic surfactant in acid form to mono- or

triethanolamine having to be determined in such a way that a liquid phase
which is still flowable and pumpable between 5 and 20°C and preferably

between 8 and 15°C is obtained after neutralization of the anionic
surfactant in its acid form. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that, in
the preparation of the mixture containing anionic surfactants in step (a), a

mixture of ethoxylated nonionic surfactants and anionic surfactants in their
acid form is initially prepared, the ethoxylated nonionic surfactants

preferably being introduced first and the anionic surfactants in their acid
form being added thereafter.
A process as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that the mixture of
anionic surfactants in their acid form and the ethoxylated nonionic

surfactants is prepared in a ratio by weight of 1:0.5 to 1:30 and preferably
in a ratio by weight of up to 1:20.
A process as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the
mixture containing anionic surfactants is pre
pared in step (a) by partial
neutralization of a mixture of one or more anionic surfactants in acid form

and ethoxylated nonionic surfactants with a solid or liquid, basic inorganic
neutralization medium.
A process as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that a mixture
containing anionic surfactants, i.e. 60 to 95% by weight of anionic

surfactant in acid form and 5 to 40% by weight of anionic surfactant, based
on the quantity of the anionic surfactant in acid form originally used, is

prepared in step (a), the mixture containing anionic surfactants being
flowable and pumpable at temperatures of 5 to 20°C and preferably at

temperatures of 8 to 15°C.
A process as claimed in claim 6 or 7, characterized in that solid
sodium hydroxide or an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, preferably a

concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, is used as the inorganic
neutralization medium.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that at
least one alkaline inorganic salt from the group consisting of alkali metal

carbonate, alkali metal bicarbonate and alkali metal silicate with a molar
ratio of M
2
O to SiO
2
 (M is preferably sodium or potassium) of 1:1 to 1:4.0 is
used as the solid or as part of the solid mixture in step (b). 
A process as claimed in claim 9, characterized in that an inorganic
solid mixture is initially introduced in step (b), the mixture containing alkali

metal carbonate or a mixture of alkali metal carbonate and alkali metal
silicate in a molar ratio of 1:1 to 1:3.5 and optionally at least one other

solid, for example a solid from the group of builders, such as phosphates,
preferably sodium tripolyphosphates, and zeolite, or sulfate, preferably

solids of the type which do not undergo any chemical change after the
addition of a partly neutralized mixture containing anionic surfactants

obtained in step (a).
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that
only part, i.e. around 30 to 70% by weight and preferably around 35 to 60%

by weight, of the total solids present is initially introduced in step (b), the
remainder of the solids being added, preferably in portions, in step (c) after

the complete neutralization of the anionic surfactants in acid form still
present in step (b).
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that
the granules are impregnated with nonionic surfactants.
A process as claimed in claim 12, characterized in that the granules
are impregnated with the quantity of nonionic surfactants corresponding to

the theoretical absorption capacity of the granules without any adverse
effect on the processability of the granules.
A process claimed in any of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that a
detergent is produced which contains up to 30% by weight and preferably

10 to 25% by weight of anionic and nonionic surfactants and 50 to 80% by
weight of the solids initially introduced or added in steps b) and c), the

percentage content of ethoxylated nonionic surfactants being up to about
20% by weight, preferably 5 to 18% by weight and, more preferably, above

10% by weight.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 14, characterized in that a
detergent containing up to 30% by weight and preferably from 0 to 25% by

weight of zeolite, based on water-free substance, is produced.
