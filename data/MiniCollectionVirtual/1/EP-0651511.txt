<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and
more particularly, to a semiconductor device where MOS logic
circuits and bipolar logic circuits are mixed.Recently, in a high speed logic large scale integrated (LSI)
circuit, particularly, in a communication LSI circuit, bipolar
circuits such as emitter coupled logic (ECL) circuits having
high speed characteristics and high load characteristics and
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits (or
bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS)) having a low power consumption and a
high manufacturing yield are constructed on the same chip to
thereby improve the performance of a system.In a first prior art semiconductor device where a CMOS circuit
and an ECL circuit are mixed, the CMOS circuit is operated
between a positive power supply voltage VDD and a ground
voltage GND, and the ECL circuit is operated between the
ground voltage GND and a negative power supply voltage VEE.
This will be explained later in detail.In the first prior art semiconductor device such as known from
"Proceedings of the IEEE 1998 Custom Integrated Circuits Conference",
A. Denda et al., "A 270 ps/24000 gate BiCMOS gate
array", pages 8.4.1 - 8.4.4, however, since the difference
between CMOS logic signals and ECL logic signals is large, the
number of elements of level conversion circuits is increased,
and also, a time required for such a level conversion is
increased. In a second prior art semiconductor device where a CMOS
circuit and an ECL circuit are mixed, the CMOS circuit is also
operated between the ground voltage GND and the negative power
supply voltage VEE. in the same way as the ECL circuit (see JP-A-SH062-214655).
This will be also explained later in detail.Another example for the second prior art semiconductor device
can be taken from US-A-4,453,095. This semiconductor device
however requires 2 reference voltages. Also, the CMOS circuit
of this reference operates at a reduced voltage swing such
that the signal to noise ratio is deteriorated. In the second prior art semiconductor device,
however, since the CMOS circuit is operated based upon the
power supply voltage VEE (precisely, -5.2 V or -4.5 V),
the elements of the CMOS circuit are deteriorated in
reliability, and the duration of gate insulating layers
thereof is also deteriorated.Therefore, in a semiconductor device where
bipolar circuits and CMOS circuits (or BiCMOS circuits)
are mixed, it is an object of the present invention to
simplify level conversion circuits between CMOS logic
signals and bipolar logic signals
