<ABSTRACT>
A stator of a motor of this invention includes a ring-like yoke (2), tooth-shaped iron cores equidistantly disposed on the inner 
periphery of the yoke (2), slots (4) defined between adjacent tooth-shaped iron cores (3), stator coils (5) fitted into the slots (4), 

and bridge portions (31) connecting the inner peripheral side of the adjacent tooth-shaped cores (3). A rotor (6) is so disposed as 
to oppose the iron cores (3) through a gap, and the proportion of a length s of the bridge portion (31) in the circumferential direction 

to the tooth pitch p in the circumferential direction is within the range of 0.01 to 0.20. Accordingly, a cogging torque of the 
motor can be reduced without lowering EMF.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stator for a motor comprised
of laminated iron cores.Hitherto, there is known a stator for a motor, which
is constituted with a ring-shaped yoke portion iron core,
tooth portion iron cores arranged at an equal interval on
the inner circumferential side of the yoke portion iron
core, and stator coils fitted into slots formed between
respective adjacent tooth portion iron cores, wherein a
rotor is oppositely disposed through a gap on the inner
circumferential side of the tooth portion iron cores. In
this case, there is disclosed a stator core in which the
inner circumferential sides of respective adjacent tooth
portion iron cores are connected by portions serving as
a bridge between magnetic poles (hereinafter simply referred
to as bridging portions) having a small cross section
in order not to take the stator assembly to pieces at
the time of punching or assembling of tooth portion iron
cores and yoke portion iron core, and to reduce leakage
reactance (e.g., the Japanese Patent Application Laid
Open No. 196034/1987 (Tokkaisho No. 62-196034), the
Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No.
174531/1988 (Tokkaisho No. 63-174531).However, with the above-described configuration,
there were
the drawbacks that the cogging torque cannot be sufficiently
small and/or unevenness of the cogging torque becomes greater in
dependency upon the dimensions of tooth portion iron cores
employed.German patent DE-A-3,907,516 discloses a stator for a motor wherein a ratio of the
length s in a circumferential direction of the bridging portion connecting adjacent to the
portion iron cores to the pitch p in the circumferential direction of the tooth portion iron core
is equal to approximately 0.125. However, the ratio of the thickness b in a radial direction of
the bridging portion to the thickness t of a lamented steel plate of the tooth portion iron core
is not disclosed or mentioned. This ratio is of importance in the present invention and
therefore this document fails to disclose sufficient details for the purposes of the present
invention.An object of this invention is to provide a stator for a
motor, which has small cogging torque.This invention is directed to a stator for a motor, comprising a ring-shaped yoke
portion iron core, tooth portion iron cores arranged at an equal interval on the inner
circumferential side of the yoke portion iron core, stator coils fitted into slots formed between
respective adjacent tooth portion iron cores, and bridging portions for connecting the inner
circumferential

circumferential side of the tooth portion iron cores (3),

   characterized in that the ratio (α) of the length (s) in a circumferential direction
of the bridging portion (31) to a pitch (p) in the circumferential direction of the tooth

portion iron cores (3) falls within a range of 0.01 to 0.20, and in that the ratio (β) of the
thickness (b) in a radial direction of the bridging portion (31) 
to the thickness (t) of
laminated steel plates of the tooth portion iron core (3) falls within a range of 0.2 to 1.0.
