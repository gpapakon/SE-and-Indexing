<ABSTRACT>
In order to ensure that the screening effect of HF cable screening remains effective and constant over a wide frequency range, the invention calls for the screening to consist of aluminium foil (4) shaped to form a tube concentric with the cable and a series of electrically conducting wires (3) which are in electrical contact with the foil (4) and are also concentric with it. An HF cable designed in this way is safe from interfering radiation over a wide frequency band and exhibits a high degree of electromagnetic compatibility. The characteristics of an HF line of this kind make it extremely suitable for use as an antenna line, particularly in vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
High frequency cable or lead, especially coaxial
cable, comprising a high frequency screen and an outer

conductor of a lengthwise extending, electrically conductive
foil (4) and of a series of electrically conductive screen

wires connected in electrically conductive manner to the foil,
extending parallel to one another, and arranged around the

periphery of the foil (4) which is formed into a tube,
characterised in that
the screen wires (3) extending parallel to one another
run substantially parallel to the axis, with the

deviation from the axis being no more than 5Â°,
the screen wires (3) are distributed with at least
approximately equidistant spacing around the periphery

of the foil (4),
the screen wires (3) are arranged within the foil (4),
the optical covering due to the screen wires (3) is 10
to 80%, preferably 20 to 40%,
the foil (4) is a metallised plastics foil,
the plastics layer of the foil (4) is arranged on the
outside, over which is extruded a sleeve (5) of the same

or similar plastics material and the foil (4) is
connected intimately to the sleeve (5) by extrusion heat.
Cable according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
metal is aluminium, an aluminium alloy, copper or a copper

alloy.
Cable according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 the screen wires (3) are of copper, a copper alloy or
silvered copper.
