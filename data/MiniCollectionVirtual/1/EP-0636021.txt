<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
pharmacologically active derivatives of
propargylamine and their use in the treatment of
anxiety, psychotic states and aggressive behavior in
affected animals.Aggressive behavior as well as anxiety
appear to be adaptation factors. However, when they
become excessive or pathologic, they disable the
normal interaction of an individual within society.
It then becomes necessary to inhibit these
behaviors.Antipsychotic and axiolytic agents such as
chlorpromazine and diazepam are widely used to treat
such pathologic anxiety and/or aggressivity.
However, when used in the appropriate doses, these
agents cause undesirable side effects such as
sedation and ataxia. Buspirone, a well-known
anxiolytic agent, causes markedly less sedation than
diazepam, but its anxiolytic activity is initiated
only several days after administration. The
discovery of new anxiolytic agents that do not
induce undesirable side effects and have a more
rapid onset of action would be a valuable addition
to the present psychotherapeutic agents available to
the physician.British Patent No. 1,055,548 discloses
N,N-disubstituted 1-aryl-3-aminopropynes having
pharmacological activity, in particular an anti-ulceration
effect sedative effects, an anti-spasmodic
effect of the papaverine type on smooth
muscle and an analgesic-anti-inflammatory effect.Psychopharmacology, Vol. 62, No. 2, 1979,
pages 123-128 relates to propynylamines which have
an unsubstituted propargyl group and which are 
useful as monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Martin et
al, on the other hand, have studied and reported in
J. Med. Chem., Vol. 18, No. 9, 1975, pages 883-888,
the requirements for a good monoamine oxidase
inhibitory activity in propargylamines; the authors
conclude that mono- or disubstitution of methyl
groups for the α-hydrogen atoms of the propynyl
group abolishes all inhibitory activity.The present invention is directed to the
use of a propargylamine derivative having the
general formula:

wherein:
R is a hydrogen atom, an unsubstituted
phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted with
halogen, trifluoromethyl loweralkoxy, nitro, cyano,
amido or N,N-diloweralkylamido;R1, R2 or R3 are the same or different and
each represent a hydrogen atom or a loweralkyl
group; andR4 is a hydrogen atom or a loweralkyl,
benzyl, phenethyl or furyl group; orR3 and R4 together with the nitrogen atom
to which they are attached form a piperidinyl group;
with the proviso that when R is a hydrogen atom, R1
represents a hydrogen atom or a loweralkyl group and
R2
