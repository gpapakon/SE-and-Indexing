<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a processing module (1) for a modular automation system, for example a modular programmable controller, the automation system comprising a central unit (15) and peripheral units (16, 17) subordinate to the central unit (15), for example input/output subassemblies (16, 17), the peripheral units (16, 17) being able to be coupled to each other via a device bus (11). The processing module (1) has a processor (2), a memory (3, 4), a blockable bus coupling element (5), which can be coupled to the device bus (11), and a blockable central unit coupling element (6), which can be coupled to the central unit (15), all of which can be connected to one another via a module bus (10) which is internal to the processing module. According to the invention, the processing module (1) has a communications interface (8) which is connected to the processor (2). As a result, the central unit (15) can be relieved to a considerable extent of communications activity.

Processing module (1) for a modular automation
system, for example a modular memory-programmable

control, whereby the automation system comprises a
central unit (15) and peripheral units (16, 17)

subordinate to the central unit (15), for example
input/output modules (16, 17), whereby the peripheral

units (16, 17) can be coupled to each other by way of a
device bus (11), whereby the processing module (1) has

a processor (2), a memory (3, 4), a blockable bus
coupling element (5) which can be coupled to the device

bus (11) and a blockable central unit coupling element
(6) which can be coupled to the central unit (15),

which are connected to each other by way of a module
bus (10) inside the processing module, whereby the

processing module (1) has at least one communication
interface connected by way of the module bus (10) to

the processor (2), and whereby accesses of the central
unit (15) to the peripheral units (16, 17) take place

indirectly by way of the processing module (1).
Processing module (1) according to claim 1,
characterized in that the processing module (1) of the

automation system can be communicatively connected by
way of its communication interface (8) to a

communication interface (8') of a processing module
(1') of another automation system.
Processing module (1) according to claim 1 or
2, characterized in that it has a programming interface

(7) connected to the processor (2).
Processing module (1) according to claim 1, 2
or 3, characterized in that it has an alarm interface

(9) connected to the processor (2).
Redundant automation system, comprising at
least two modular automation systems for controlling a

technical system (25) or a technical process by way of
process sensor elements and process ac
tuators (19), 
comprising a central unit (15), a processing module (1)

according to one of the above claims and peripheral
units (16, 17), whereby the peripheral units (16, 17)

are coupled to each other by way of a device bus,
whereby the processing module is coupled by way of its

bus coupling element (5) to the device bus (11) and by
way of its central unit coupling element (6) to the

central unit, whereby the communication interfaces (8,
8') of the processing modules (1, 1') of the modular

automation systems are connected to each other by way
of a communication system (26).
Redundant automation system according to claim
5, characterized in that the modular automation systems

synchronize themselves by way of the processing modules
(1, 1').
Redundant automation system according to claim
5 or 6, characterized in that all the communication

between the modular automation systems, for example the
updating of one of the modular automation systems by

the other modular automation system takes place by way
of the processing modules (1, 1').
