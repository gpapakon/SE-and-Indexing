<ABSTRACT>
Sports shoe has a quarter (3) associated with a shell 
(2) and has improved lateral rigidity. The shoe includes at 

least one rigid element (4) which affects the metatarsal 
region, the heel region (8) and the malleolar region (11) at 

least at the inner side of the foot. This allows to obtain a 
rigid structure that, for example in the case of ski boots, 

allows optimum transmission of efforts from the leg to the 
binding and thus to the ski.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved sports
shoe.Sports shoes, such as ski boots, are currently usually
produced by injecting plastics at suitable molds in order to
obtain a shell and at least one quarter.For example, French patent no. 2,119,653 discloses a
method for manufacturing a ski shoe, comprising a shell and
a quarter joined in a single element, which is composed of
an outer element and an inner element which are made of two
materials and are mutually associated.The inner element, made of generally rigid plastics,
forms at least part of the sole and part of the covering of
the ankle and is also open along its front part.The outer element, made of generally flexible plastics,
forms the sole, the front part of the foot, the upper, the
heel, a rear part, a covering for the ankle, the foot instep
and the part that surrounds the ankle.This manufacturing method has the drawback that it
requires the insertion of the inner element in the outer
element.Furthermore, the inner element has a uniform degree of
rigidity in practically all the regions that surround the
foot, except for the upper part, so that optimum fit cannot
be achieved.The execution of the inner element by using rigid
material furthermore leads to a shoe having a considerable
overall weight.Furthermore, the sole of this shoe which is in contact
with the ski is entirely made of rigid plastics, and this 
further increases the weight of the shoe.US patent 3,545,103 discloses a closure device for ski
boots comprising a metal side plate that laterally surrounds
the outer part of the foot and with which a cuff is
rotatably associated.Although said plate stiffens the boot to a certain
extent, it nonetheless does not allow optimum transmission
of efforts since it is affected by the tension applied to
the lever and affects only the lateral region of the foot.This allows the leg to move without transmitting the
movements to the ski in an optimum manner.Furthermore, this solution in any case does not allow
optimum transmission of efforts from the foot to the ski due
to the limited region of the foot affected by the plate.US patent 3,067,531 discloses a ski boot composed of a
sole to which an inner quarter and an outer quarter are
connected; two engagement elements are interposed between
said quarters and are arranged longitudinally with respect
to them.The inner and outer quarters are in turn associated, by
means of a pivot, to a curved fixed element which is located
approximately below the malleolar region, again in the
interspace between
