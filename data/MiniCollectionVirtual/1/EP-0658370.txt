<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an exhaust-gases-purifying 
catalyst includes the steps of loading an NO
x
 adsorbent on a 
porous support, carbonating the porous support with the NO
x
 
adsorbent loaded, thereby converting the NO
x
 adsorbent into 
carbonate, and loading a noble metal catalyst ingredient on the 

porous support with the carbonate loaded. The process can 
produce an exhaust-gases-purifying catalyst on which the NO
x
 
adsorbent and the noble metal catalyst ingredient are loaded in 

large amounts and which can stably and efficiently purify NO
x
 
during the fuel-lean side (i.e., in the oxygen-rich 

atmospheres) driving.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing
an exhaust-gases-purifying catalyst. More particularly, it
relates to a process for producing an exhaust-gases-purifying
catalyst which can efficiently purify nitrogen oxides (NOX) in
exhaust gases whose oxygen concentrations are at the
stoichiometric point or more than required for oxidizing carbon
monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) therein.As catalysts for purifying automotive exhaust gases, there
have been employed 3-way catalysts so far which oxidize CO and
RC and reduce NOX to purify the exhaust gases. For example,
the 3-way catalysts have been known widely which comprise a
heat resistant support formed of cordierite, a catalyst carrier
layer formed of gamma-alumina and disposed on the support, and
a noble metal catalyst ingredient selected from the group
consisting of Pt, Pd and Rh and loaded on the catalyst carrier
layer.The purifying performance of the 3-way catalysts for 
purifying exhaust gases depends greatly on the air-fuel ratio
A/F of automotive engine. For instance, when the air-fuel
weight ratio is larger than 14.6, i.e., when the fuel
concentration is low (or on the fuel-lean side), the oxygen
concentration is high in exhaust gases. Accordingly, the
oxidation reactions purifying CO and HC are active, but the
reduction reactions purifying NOX are inactive. On the other
hand, when the air-fuel ratio is smaller than 14.6, i.e., when
the fuel concentration is higher (or on the fuel-rich side),
the oxygen concentration is low in exhaust gases. Accordingly,
the oxidation reactions are inactive, but the reduction
reactions are active. From document DE 38 32 268 a process for manufacturing a catalyst is
known, wherein gold as the noble metal compound is loaded on the surface of
alkaline-earth metal compounds. In this respect, it has been suggested to
contact carbonate particles carried on a support with a gold solution. Thus, the
alkaline-earth metal compounds act as a carrier for the gold particles.
Moreover, the alkaline-earth metal compounds should have a low solubility in
water.From document JP-A-60 206 448 it has become known to deposit a
carbonated NOx-adsorbing compound on a support and to subsequently
deposit a noble metal from a solution. The noble metal is loaded on a support
comprising NO2-interstitial lanthanum oxide (La2O3•CO2) and alumina,
wherein the NO2-interstitial lanthanum oxide (La2O3.CO2) is a powder. When
the noble metal is loaded in an aqueous solution condition on the support
comprising NO2-interstitial lanthanum
