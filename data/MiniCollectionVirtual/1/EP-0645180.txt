<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a method for mixing feedstock 
with fluidized catalyst in a fluid catalytic cracking 

(FCC) riser reactor. A dispersed catalyst suspension is 
passed upwardly at a velocity of 0.15 to 1.22 m/sec (0.5 

to 4 ft/sec). Atomized feedstock is injected downwardly 
at a velocity relative to the catalyst velocity 

of -9 to -305 m/sec (-30 to -1000 ft./sec) 
to produce a turbulently mixed reaction suspension. 

Vaporizing feedstock rapidly accelerates the reaction 
suspension in approximately plug flow. The slip factor 

between catalyst and hydrocarbon in the reaction 
suspension defining the departure from ideal plug flow is 

thereby reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid catalytic cracking 
(FCC) process for converting petroleum derived hydrocarbon 
feedstocks to liquid boiling range products. The invention more 
particularly relates to a method of combining feedstock with 
catalyst to improve flow characteristics in a fluid catalytic 
cracking (FCC) riser reactor. Fluid catalytic cracking processes are well known in 
the art. In the catalytic cracking process, liquid hydrocarbon 
feedstocks such as diesel oil, gas oil, vacuum gas oil, atmospheric 
residuum, deasphalted oil and combinations thereof are contacted 
with active cracking catalysts such as a crystalline aluminum 
silicate at temperatures of from 420°C to 760°C, 
preferably 450°C to 565°C, at pressures of 0.13 to 0.31 
MPa, for a period of time in the order of about 10 seconds or 
less, preferably about 0.5 seconds to convert the feedstock. The 
process utilizes pelleted catalyst in a moving bed, or powdered 
or microspherical catalyst in a fluidized reaction zone. There 
are many types of cracking catalysts. One group referred to as 
zeolite catalysts, are commercially preferred. Higher boiling  
 
hydrocarbons such as vacuum gas oil are cracked using zeolite 
catalyst to produce lower boiling hydrocarbons with the relative 
product mix, including C₄ olefins, gasoline and solid 
carbonaceous deposits determined by catalyst contact time, 
reactor conditions and feedstock composition. The vaporization rate of liquid hydrocarbon feedstock 
is significant in a fluidized catalytic cracking reaction zone. 
With liquid feedstock, the time required for vaporization of 
atomized liquid droplets reduces the time available for the 
desired catalytic reactions thus tending to reduce feed 
conversion per pass with a consequent adverse influence on yield. 
The process can be carried out and good product yields achieved 
with an all vapor feedstock because the desired reactions occur 
in the vapor phase. Vapor phase also provides rapid transport of 
reactants to and from active catalytic sites which favors a high 
reaction rate. However, preheating the feedstock for complete 
vaporization prior to injection into the reactor adversely 
affects process economics. Thus, it has been found that vaporization of the 
feedstock is critical. Essentially complete vaporization of 
atomized feedstock must be effected in the injection zone. It has also been found advantageous to vaporize all 
feedstock in about one second or less by atomizing the liquid to 
form a fine dispersion of droplets of about

A fluid catalytic cracking process carried out 
between a hydrocarbon and a particulate catalyst in a 

vertically elongated riser reactor zone comprising an 
initial catalyst fluidization zone, a hydrocarbon 

injection zone and a reaction zone comprising the steps 
of: 

   fluidizing the particulate catalyst in the 
catalyst fluidization zone, and passing the particulate 

catalyst upwardly to the hydrocarbon injection zone at a 
catalyst velocity of 0.15 to 1.22 m/sec 

(0.5 to 4 ft./sec.); 
   injecting the hydrocarbon into the hydrocarbon 

injection zone in the form of atomized droplets in a 
particulate catalyst/hydrocarbon weight ratio of 5/1 to 

40/1 and at an injection velocity relative to the catalyst 
velocity of -9 to -305 m/sec (-30 to -1000 ft./sec); 

   passing both the particulate catalyst and the 
hydrocarbon upwardly through the reaction zone at reaction 

conditions and withdrawing the particulate catalyst and 
the hydrocarbon from the reaction zone, thereby defining 

a particulate catalyst residence time (t catalyst) and a 
hydrocarbon residence time (t hc) in the riser reaction 

zone; 
   thereby maintaining a riser reaction zone slip 

ratio (S") of 10/1 to 1/1 according to the formula: 
S'' = t catalystt hc
