<CLAIMS>
ISDN switching system with a system program 
module constructed in accordance with the principles of 

object-oriented programming for the handling of switched 
connections, in which the protocol modules used in 

protocol architectures for the standardization of 
functional switching procedures are represented as 

object-oriented structural elements which represent 
classes in the sense of object-oriented programming and 

of which objects are instantiated for connections and/or 
for calls and/or for signalling operations, a copy of the 

data area belonging to the structural element concerned 
being in each case set up in the data store as a kind of 

pattern, in which data individual to the connection or 
call or signalling are entered and which remains in 

existence only for the duration of a connection concerned 
or a call concerned or a signalling operation concerned. 
ISDN switching system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that protocol modules are in each case 

represented by a plurality of structural elements on 
which common program sequences and data are combined in 

a hierarchically higher-level structural element.
