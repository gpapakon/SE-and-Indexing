<ABSTRACT>
Containers in the form of pots, partic for dairy products or individual desserts, having a hollow body supported by a central foot are made from thermoplastic material as separate bodies (11) and feet (12) that are welded together. The bodies and feet have complimentary forms to give self centering on jamming. A body (11) and foot (12) are brought together, axial coincident, between an anvil (5) itself engaging in the body and an electrode (10a) of a welding head (10). The anvil and electrode are closed axially and the electrode (10a) penetrates the anvil to simultaneously make the lesion between the centering pieces (1a, 12a). The soldering head is powered to weld the two parts by heat melting. The anvil and electrode are then separated to release the completed pot. Also claimed is the implementing equipment.

Process for the production of cup-shaped containers 
having a hollow body supported by a central foot, 

of the kind in which: 

a series of hollow bodies (11) and a series of 
feet (12) are produced separately from a thermoplastic; 
a body (11) and a foot (12) are brought simultaneously 
into axial coincidence between an anvil (5) 

suitable for being engaged in the body and the electrode 
(10
a
) of a welding head (10); 
the said anvil (5) and the said electrode (10
a
) 
are moved axially towards each other in order to make the 

anvil penetrate until it bears against the bottom of the 
body (11); 
the welding head (10) is supplied in order to 
carry out the final assembly of the two elements (11, 12) 

by heat-fusing; 
and, finally, the anvil (5) and the electrode 
(10
a
) are moved away from each other so as to allow the 
containers or cups (11-12) obtained to be extracted and 

removed,
 
characterized in that each anvil (5) and each electrode 

(10
a
) is made to include centring means (5
a
, 10
b
) which 
are capable, during penetration of the anvil into the 

body, of mating with corresponding means (11
a
, 12
a
) 
provided on each hollow body (11) and on each foot (12), 

heat-fusing taking place at the said centring means. 
Machine for the implementation of the process 
according to Claim 1, of the kind comprising, in 

combination:  
 


a series of anvils (5) profiled to penetrate 
into a corresponding number of hollow bodies (11) produced 

beforehand; 
a series, of corresponding number, of welding 
heads (10) whose electrodes (10
a
) are oriented along the 
axis of the aforementioned anvils (5); 
means (4, 9) for driving the anvils (5) and the 
heads (10) in an alternating axial movement suitable for 

mutually moving them closer together and for moving them 
apart; 
and transfer means (13-14, 15) designed to 
bring a corresponding number of hollow bodies (11) and of 

feet (12), produced beforehand, into axial coincidence 
between the abovementioned anvils and electrodes, the 

latter being supplied, at the end of the movement bringing 
them closer together, so as to weld the bodies (11) 

and the feet (12),
 
each anvil (5) and each electrode (10
a
) include centring 
means (5
a
, 10
b
) capable, as the anvils and heads are 
moved closer together, of mating with corresponding means 

(11
a
, 12
a
) provided on each hollow body (11) and on each 
foot (12). 
Machine according to Claim 2, in which the anvils 
(5) are supported by a horizontal beam (3) which double-acting 

cylinders (4) set into an alternating motion. 
Machine according to either of Claims 2 and 3, in 
which the transfer means comprise, on the one hand, a 

distributor (13) associated with vertical channels (14) 
for bringing a series of feet (12) under the electrodes 

(10
a
) and, on the other hand, slideways (15) associated 
with a pusher for bringing, in jolts, the hollow bodies 

(11) between the said electrodes and the anvils (5).
