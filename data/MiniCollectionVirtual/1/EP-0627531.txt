<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support element (20, 48) having an opening on one side for a building element, of which the support is enclosed by an insulating means (3) which has an essentially sound-insulating effect and comprises panels (8, 22, 32, 33). In the case of said support element, the invention provides that at least the top panel (8) of the outer shell (1) is provided with at least one reinforcement element (2, 29) and is connected thereto in a load-transferring manner and is arranged such that it follows the deflection curve between the two rising wall panels (32, 33).

A support element (20, 48) having an outer shell (1) 
consisting of vertically emerging wall plates (32, 33, 63, 64, 

65) and one horizontal cover plate (8) and one floor plate (9) 
each, an one-sided opening (21) for a construction element (13) 

and an insulation (3) which essentially acts as sound 
insulation and is arranged in the outer shell, characterized by 

at least one stiffening element (2, 29, 41-43, 47) seperate 
from the cover plate which is supported at its ends on emerging 

plates (32, 33, 64, 65) of the support element (20, 48), 
respectively, and has been connected to the cover plate (8) in 

a way allowing weight transfer. 
Support element according to claim 1, characterized by the 
stiffening element's (2, 29, 47) location in the crimp (4, 5) 

of the cover plate (8). 
Support element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the stiffening element consists of a plate (29), which is 

connected to the crimps (4) of the cover plate (8) and extends 
with its edges (32, 35, 36) to the emerging walls of the outer 

shell. 
Support element according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the edges (32, 35, 36, 36') of the plate (29) are edged off and 

that, at least, some plates' edges (32, 36) are connected to 
their corresponding outer shell walls (32, 33) and to the edge 

(36) of the cover plate (8) of the outer shell (1). 
Support element according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in 
that the plate (29) is made of sheet metal and its connections 

(30) are precision-welded to the outer shell (1).  
 
Support element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the stiffening element consists of at least one hollow section 

(2; 41-43) which is located at the side of a crimp (4). 
Support element according to claim 6, characterized in that a 
hollow section (2) is attached to the upper edge (36) of the 

opening (21). 
Support element according to claims 6 or 7, characterized in 
that one or all hollow sections (2; 41-43) are located between 

the stiffening plate (29) of one of claims 3 to 5 and the cover 
plate (8) of the outer shell. 
Support element according to one of claims 6 through 8, 
characterized in that the hollow section (2) is a square 

section. 
Support element according to one of claims 6 through 9, 
characterized in that the hollow section is welded to the front 

edge of the cover plate (8) of the outer shell (1). 
Support element according to one of claims 6 through 10, 
characterized in that one of the hollow sections (2, 41) is 

located behind the front edge of the cover plate (8) of the 
outer shell, the front edge being edged downwardly. 
Support element according to one of claims 6 through 11, 
characterized by sections (11, 32, 35, 36') or crimps (4, 5) in 

the area of the cover plate (8), and the back wall (33) and/or 
the floor plate (9). 
Support element according to one of claims 6 through 12, 
characterized in that the hollow section (2; 41-43) extends 

into the interior of the support element by the depth of the 
crimps (4) of the cover plate (8).  

 
Support element according to one of claims 6 through 13, 
characterized by a supporting metal sheet (7) on the bottom 

(12) of the insulation (3). 
Support element according to one of claims 6 through 14, 
characterized in that the insulation (3) in the bottom area 

(12) comprises a recess (13, 44) which hosts an elastomeric 
insulating plate (6) as support. 
Support element according to one of claims 6 through 14, 
characterized in that the bottom area (12) of the insulation 

(3) is formed by an elastomeric insulating plate (6). 
Support element according to one of claims 1 through 16, 
characterized by a sealing band (24) along the front edges 

surrounding the opening (21). 
Support element according to one of claims 1 through 17, 
characterized by a two-shell construction method, which 

essentially consists of the outer shell (1) and the insulation 
layer (2). 
Support element according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the stiffening element consists of at least one section located 

on the cover plate (8).
