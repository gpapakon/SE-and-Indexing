<ABSTRACT>
A bridge connector stirrup for electrical interconnection of components (3) in 
two arrays (2) of components disposed above one another at standardized 

spacing comprises preferably three insulated conductors (4 - 6), which are 
connectable with their ends to a component (3) in each array (2). The 

conductors (4 - 6) have their end regions turned to face in the same direction 
and preferably coaxial with one another. An interconnection line through the 

end regions is located a distance from the sections of the conductors (4 - 6) 
between their ends in that the conductors, at one end region, display a bend 

of an angle of 180Â° which merges into a straight portion which is parallel 
with the interconnection line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bridge connector stirrup for 
electrical interconnection of components in two different arrays 
of components in a central electrical installation, as described 
in the opening part of claim 1. The present invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a 
bridge connector stirrup for electrical interconnection of components 
in two arrays of components in a central electrical installation 
as described in the opening part of claim 8. Central electrical installations often house components such as 
fuse boxes, automatic fuses, relays, contactors and the like, 
side-by-side in arrays where the arrays are generally placed at 
standardized spacing in a vertical direction from one another. In 
the electrical interconnection of different components in such an 
installation, use has previously been made of conventional conductor 
material in linear lengths which are cut on site, stripped of 
insulation at their end regions and thereafter connected between 
the components. Such a mode of approach is extremely time-consuming 
and gives a work result which defies ready overview, in that the 
wiring will easily assume the appearance of a "mare's nest". DE 3 813 099 discloses in fig 2 a bridge connector stirrup that 
has terminal portions at opposite ends, said terminal portions 
being directed in the same direction and further located along a 
common center line. The terminal portions are provided at opposite 
ends of a connecting portion which is parallel with the centerline 
and located at a distance therefrom. The connector stirrups of DE 3 813 099 are separately made and 
lacks insulation.  
 The present invention has for its object to realise a bridge 
connector stirrup of the type disclosed by way of introduction, 
the bridge connector stirrup being designed in such a manner that 
it substantially rationalises interconnection work in a central 
electrical installation, and that it provides for neat and visually 
comprehensible wiring at the same time as space requirements are 
reduced to a minimum. The present invention further has for its 
object to realise a bridge connector stirrup which is simple and 
economical to manufacture and which is very easy to mount in place. The present invention yet further has for its object to realise a 
method of producing the bridge connector stirrup intimated by way 
of introduction, the method being devised to make for rational 
and simple production, at the same time as employment of the 
connector is facilitated. The objects

<CLAIMS>
A bridge connector stirrup for electrical interconnection of 
components (3) in two different arrays (2) of components in a 

central electrical installation, comprising at least one insulated 
conductor (4-6) of a predetermined length, the conductor being 

connectable with its end regions (11, 12) to one component in 
each array, the arrays being at standardized spacing, wherein the 

conductor (4-6) has both of its end regions (11, 12) turned to 
face in the same direction; and an interconnection axis or line 

(10) between the end regions is located in spaced apart relationship 
from an intermediate portion (9) of the bridge connector stirrup 

interconnecting the end regions, 
characterized in that,
 each 
conductor (4-6) has a hose-shaped insulation member, the insulation 

members being interconnected in a spaced apart relationship via 
junction pieces (7, 8) of insulation material, thereby to form an 

assembly.

characterized in that,
 it has three substanstially mutually 
parallel conductors (4-6). 
The bridge connector stirrup as claimed in any one of claims 1 
to 4, 
characterized in that,
 it is of a length which amounts to a 
whole number multiple of the array spacing in the central electrical 

installation. 
The bridge connector stirrup as claimed in claim 6 or 7, 
characterized
