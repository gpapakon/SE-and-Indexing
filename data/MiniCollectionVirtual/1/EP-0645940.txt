<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a base station and a
mobile station to be used in a mobile communication system.First, the conventional mobile communication system
will be briefly described for a case of a CDMA (Code
Division Multiple Access) scheme. In the CDMA mobile
communication scheme, in order to alleviate the so called
Near/Far problem related to the variation of distances from
the base station to the mobile stations, the base station
carries out the transmission power control with respect to
the mobile station in communication such that the radio
wave from all the mobile stations can be received at a
uniform receiving level at the base station. Here, all the
mobile stations carry out the communications at the same
frequency so that the communications of the mobile stations
interfere with each other and the communication quality is
determined by this interference. However, in order to
increase the subscriber capacity, the transmission power
from the base station is set to be the least possible power
for guaranteeing such a quality that the radio wave for the
particular mobile station does not interfere with the other
mobile stations. See, E. Kudoh and T. Matsumoto: "Effect of
Transmitter Power Control Imperfections on Capacity in
DS/CDMA Cellular Mobile Radios", IEEE ICC '92, pp. 310.1.1-310.1.6,
for further detail.In the CDMA mobile communication scheme, the radio
channels are formed by using the same frequency and the 
different spread codes, so that when the mobile station
moves to another cell (zone), the radio channel can be
switched by changing the spread code without changing the
frequency. Also, when the mobile station is capable of
executing a received baseband signal processing using a
plurality of correlators, it is also possible to set up a
plurality of radio channels with respect to a plurality of
base stations by using different spread codes. By utilizing
this function at a time of the radio channel switching, it
is possible to carry out the simultaneous communications
with the base station to move in and the base station to
move out so as to prevent the breaking of the communication
at a time of the radio channel switching, which contributes
to the improvement of the communication quality and the
service in general. This operation is known as the soft
handover.In the soft handover state, the mobile station is
going to transmits the same data through a plurality of
radio channels to different base stations simultaneously,
so that the site diversity effect can be expected. By this
