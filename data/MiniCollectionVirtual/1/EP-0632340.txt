<ABSTRACT>
A sheet folding apparatus comprises a first nip (61, 62) adapted to drive a 
sheet (70) in a sheet feed direction (75); a second nip (61, 63) positioned downstream of 

the first nip and orthogonal to the sheet feed direction; and a third nip (64, 65) positioned 
downstream from and in substantially the same plane as the first nip. Control means are 

provided for reversibly driving the third nip such that a sheet driven into the third nip by 
said first nip is initially driven in said sheet feed direction and after a predetermined period 

of time is driven in a reverse direction, and wherein the driving of the sheet in the reverse 
direction against the driving of the sheet by the first nip causes a buckle to form in the 

sheet with the buckle being captured by the second nip and forming a crease in the sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a sheet folding apparatus for use with an
electrophotographic printing machine, and more particularly concerns an improved soft stop folder
apparatus.As cut and folded web sections emerge from other press folder operations, they often are
given an original or final fold by means of a blade which descends in a chopping motion when a
sheet is in position under it. The blade pushes the sheet down between two nip rollers, creating a fold
at that point. A knife folder requires deskewed and centered copy over the folding nip rollers or the
sheet may be folded off center or crooked. Also, caution in the blade positioning relative to the nip
rollers is essential or the sheet may be damaged or acquired too slowly. Also, one method of folding
sheets is to move hard stops via a stepper/servo mechanism automatically under software control in
response to control panel selection of paper size. This requires large amounts of hardware if one is
folding a 914Ã—1219 mm sheet and requires three fan-folds plus two cross-folds which dictates 5 fold
stations with attendant hardware. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to simplify the folding of sheets
without damage while at the same time improving the reliability of the folder.US-A- 1,124,375 discloses a folding and stapling device in which a folder blade drives and
creases collected sheets into a receiving head and clips of a arm member.US-A- 4,508,527 discloses a method and apparatus for quantitatively dividing zig-zag
folded sheets. A sheet of paper having a plurality of linear perforations is continuously transferred
vertically through a roller and is folded in zig-zag form by operation of a crank mechanism.EP-A-0 354 176 discloses an arrangement in which three belts are utilized for folding
sheets. A nip roller pair drives a sheet into a nip formed by one belt pair, the belts being reversed to
drive the sheet into a second belt pair to achieve folding. The belts are reversed again to deliver the
folded sheet to an output.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a sheet folding apparatus,
comprising: a first nip adapted to drive a sheet in a sheet feed direction; a second nip positioned
downstream of said first nip and orthogonal to said sheet feed direction; a third nip positioned
downstream from and in substantially the same plane as said first nip; and control means for
reversibly driving said third nip such that a sheet driven into said third nip by said first nip is initially
driven in said sheet feed direction

Sheet folding apparatus, comprising:

a first nip (61, 62) adapted to drive a sheet (70) in a sheet feed direction (75);
a second nip (62, 63) positioned downstream of said first nip and orthogonal
to said sheet feed direction;
a third nip (64, 65) positioned downstream from and in substantially the
same plane as said first nip; and
control means for reversibly driving said third nip such that a sheet driven
into said third nip by said first nip is initially driven in said sheet feed direction and after a

predetermined period of time is driven in a reverse direction, and wherein the driving of
the sheet in said reverse direction against the driving of the sheet by said first nip causes a

buckle to form in the sheet with said buckle being captured by said second nip and
forming a crease in the sheet.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the control means includes means
responsive to the size of the sheet to determine the period of time for which the third nip

is driven in the reverse direction.
The apparatus of claim 1 or claim 2, including a stepper motor
controlled by said control means and connected to the third nip.
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the first nip
comprises first and second cooperating rollers (61, 62), and the second nip comprises the

second roller (62) and a cooperating third roller (63).
The apparatus of claim 4 wherein the first roller (61) is a driven roller,
and the second and third rollers (62, 63) are idler rollers driven by contact with the first

and second rollers respectively.
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the folded sheets
pass completely through the second nip (62, 63) into a receptacle (80). 
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the first nip (61, 62)
is reversible, whereby two or more folds may be created in a sheet.
The apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 6 including means for re-feeding
a folded 
sheet from the second nip into the first nip, whereby two or more folds
may be created in a sheet.
A copier/printer adapted to print page image information onto copy
sheets, including a sheet folding apparatus in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 8

adapted to receive said copy sheets for folding.
