<ABSTRACT>
In its wall (3) the cover (1) has a first 
and a second header pipe (7, 8) from which 

respective pluralities of branch pipes (13, 14) 
emerge and protrude from the face of the cover (1) 

which is to face the interior of the battery 
container. The header pipes (7, 8) are accessible 

through corresponding respective apertures (9, 10) 
disposed in an outer surface of the cover (1) and 

can be used for the intake and re-intake of the 
electrolyte in the electrochemical process for 

forming the active material of the battery 
electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the present invention is a 
cover for a lead-acid starter battery, which, in 
known manner, comprises a rigid container 
substantially in the form of a tank and divided by 
baffles into a plurality of cells in each of which 
a plurality of electrode plates are accommodated 
immersed in an electrolyte and intended to be 
subjected to an electrochemical process for 
forming the active material, in which the battery 
is coupled to a system for recirculating and 
cooling the electrolyte present in the container. The cover according to the invention is 
characterised in that, in its wall, it has a first 
and a second header pipe from which respective 
pluralities of branch pipes emerge, protruding 
from the face of the cover intended to face the 
interior of the battery container, in respective 
positions such that, when the cover is coupled to 
the container, at least one branch pipe from the 
first header pipe and at least one branch pipe 
from the second header pipe face each cell of the 
battery; these header pipes are accessible through  
 
corresponding respective apertures disposed in an 
outer surface of the cover. Advantageously, the cover is made in a 
single part of moulded plastics material. Preferably, the access apertures in the 
header pipes are adjacent one another and 
associated therewith is a single removable closing 
element having a passage in which a filtering 
element of porous material is disposed. The header pipes can advantageously 
contain elements which can define a labyrinth path 
for the gases which are evolved when the 
electrolyte is in use and can restrain any 
particles of electrolyte carried by these gases. The coupling of a battery provided with a 
cover according to the invention to a system for 
recirculating and cooling the electrolyte when the 
electrochemical process for forming the active 
material is being performed is extremely simple: 
the first header pipe is used as a pipe for 
drawing in the electrolyte from the battery cell 
whilst the second header pipe is used for 
conveying the treated electrolyte back to the 
cells.  Following the electrochemical formation 
of the active material, the access apertures in 
the above header pipes are closed again and these 
pipes advantageously act as breather pipes for the 
gases evolved when the electrolyte is in use. The cover according to the invention has 
a small number of apertures giving access to the 
cells and a correspondingly small number of plugs. 
This can be brought about by means of a single 
mo
