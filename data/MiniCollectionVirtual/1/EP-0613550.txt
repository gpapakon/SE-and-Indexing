<ABSTRACT>
Armour resistant to knife attack comprises a flexible sheet (2) having a threat side facing a direction of threat and a protected side adjacent, in use, an area to be protected, and a plurality of armour plates (4) attached to the sides of the sheet (2), the plates (4) being grouped such that a first group attached to the protected side is in overlapping registration with a second group attached to the threat side, the registration being such that exposed regions of sheet (2) on the threat side register with the first group of plates (4) so preventing penetration of the armour through the exposed regions. By placing the overlapping groups on separate sides of the sheet, the armour is made more flexible than arrangements where the plates are mounted on the same side and are in engagement.

<DESCRIPTION>
 93/10419 ARMOURTechnical FieldThis invention relates to armour for providing protection against projectiles or knife attack. In particular, it relates to body armour for protecting, at least part, of a wearer's body.It is known to produce garments including plates of bullet- resistant and/or knife-resistant material to protect a wearer.US 4951689 discloses a surgeon's glove comprising a flexible sheet material to which are attached on one side thereof disc-like plates. The plates are attached at a central point to t projection of the sheet material and are arranged to overlap. This arrangement is designed to counter the accidental thrust of a needle or scalpel, but if a similar arrangement were used to counter a knife or bullet thrust, it would be in flexible due to frictional forces generated by overlapping contacting regions of the discs.Whilst it is possible to produce armour which 

 successfully resists knife attack, it is another matter to produce armour which is flexible enough to be worn for long periods without discomfort and to allow a wide range of movement. It is an object of the invention to provide such body armour.Disclosure of the InventionAccordingly, the invention provides armour comprising a flexible sheet having a threat side facing a direction of threat and a protected side adjacent an area to be protected in use, a plurality of armour plates attached to the sides of the sheet and grouped such that the plates of a first group attached to the protected side are in overlapping registration with the plates of a second group attached to the threat side, the registration being such that exposed regions of sheet on the threat side register with plates of the first group so preventing penetration of the armour through the exposed regions.By arranging the plates in this manner, the plates of the first group and second group overlap but do not make contact reducing the frictional forces 

generated by flexing. Further, the plates do not prevent the edges of the other plates moving out of the plane of the sheet. The flexibility of the armour is thus greatly increased. For greatest flexibility, the plates are attached at a substantially central region of the plate.By threat side it is meant, the side onto which a projectile or knife or other hazardous object may impinge. The protected side is the side which is adjacent the body of the wearer of the armour or of the wearer of the armour or adjacent an area or object to be protected.An.example of an object to be protected, is a vehicle which

<CLAIMS>
 1. Armour comprising a flexible sheet having a threat side facing a direction of threat and a protected side adjacent an area to be protected in use, characterised in that a plurality of armour plates are attached to the sides of the sheet and grouped such that the plates of a first group attached to the protected side are in overlapping registration with the plates of a second group attached to the threat side, the registration being such that exposed regions of sheet on the threat side register with plates of the first group so preventing penetration of the armour through the exposed regions.
2. Armour as claimed in claim 1 wherein the plates are attached at a substantially central region of the plate.
3. Armour as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the plates are planar.
4. Armour as claimed in claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein 

the plates include rims projecting out of the major plane of the plate towards the direction of threat.
5. Armour as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the plates are discs.
6. Armour as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the discs have a diameter in the range 20 to 50 m.m.
7. Armour as claimed in claim 6 wherein the discs have a diameter in the range 32 to 45 m.m.
8. Armour as claimed in claims 5, 6 or 7 wherein the discs are attached by means of rivets passed through centrally located holes.
9. Armour as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the plates are formed from aircraft grade aluminium.
10. Armour as claimed in any preceding claim wherein at least some of the plates are provided 


with load spreading means to prevent the rim being pressed into the sheet.
11. Armour as claimed in claim 10 wherein the load spreading means comprises a central boss.
12. Armour as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the sheet is a composite of a thermoplastic sandwiched between sheets of ballistic material.
13. Armour as claimed in claim 12 wherein the sheet has a thickness in the range of 0.5 to 1 m.m.
14. Armour as claimed in any claim 13 wherein the sheet has a weight in the range 150 to 300 grammes per square metre.
15. Armour as claimed in claim 14 wherein a third group of plates each of substantially smaller size than those of the first group of plates is arranged on the sheet such that each plate of the third group of plates lies beneath immediately 


 adjacent edges of adjacent plates of the first group.
16. Armour as claimed in claim 15 wherein the third group of plates comprises flat-headed rivets.
17. Armour as claimed in any preceding claim including flexible support means arranged adjacent the second group of plates to prevent significant movement of the plates out of the plane of the sheet.
18. Armour as claimed in claim 17 wherein the support means comprises a support sheet of polycarbonate.
19. Armour as claimed in claim 17 wherein the support means comprises ballistic nylon.
20. Armour as claimed in claim 17 wherein the support means comprises polycarbonate and ballistic nylon in combination. 


 21. Armour as claimed in any preceding claim wherein ties are provided connected between adjacent plates to prevent separation of their edges.
22. Armour substantially as herein before described with reference to and as illustrated by the drawings.
23. A knife resistant plate comprising a generally planar portion and an upturned rim extending out of a major plane of the plate towards the direction of threat.
24. A
.
 plate as claimed in claim 23 comprising load spreading means disposed on the planar portion to prevent pressing of the rim onto a surface.
25. A plate as claimed in claim 24 wherein the load spreading means is a centrally located boss.
26. A plate as claimed in any preceding claim including a plurality of holes disposed towards 


the periphery for the securing, in use, of adjacent plates by ties passed through the holes.
27. A plate substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawing.
