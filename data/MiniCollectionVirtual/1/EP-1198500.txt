<ABSTRACT>
A rocket motor insulation including an elastomer base polymer is improved in its processability by the addition of silica particles treated with a hydrophobic coating. The insulation also preferably includes a metallic coagent crosslinker, which when used in combination with the hydrophobic silica particles increases the tear strength and the elasticity of the insulation, while at the same time not adversely affecting the bonding characteristics of the insulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ROCKET MOTOR INSULATION CONTAINING HYDROPHOBIC PARTICLESRELATED APPLICATIONSThis application claims priority of U.S. provisional application 60/142,960 filed in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office on July 12, 1999.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention is directed to elastomer-based insulation for rocket motors, such as the type interposed between a solid propellant grain and a rocket motor casing to protect the casing from high temperatures experienced during burning of the solid propellant grain. In particular, this invention is directed to a solid rocket motor insulation composition that is relatively insensitive to process variables such as moisture contamination and relative humidity, yet upon curing exhibits excellent physical properties and thermal and ablative performances.2. Description of the Related ArtSolid rocket motors typically include an outer casing or case housing a solid propellant grain. The rocket motor casing is conventionally manufactured from a rigid, yet durable, material such as steel or filament-wound composite. The propellant is housed within the casing and is formulated from a composition designed to undergo combustion while producing the requisite thrust for attaining rocket motor propulsion.During operation, a heat insulating layer or layers (insulation) protects the rocket motor casing from heat and erosion caused by particle streams generated by combustion of the propellant. Typically, the insulation is bonded to the inner surface of the casing and is generally fabricated from a composition that, upon curing, is capable of withstanding the high temperature gases and erosive particles produced while the propellant grain burns. A liner layer (liner) functions to bond the propellant grain to the insulating layer and to any non-insulated portions of the casing. Liners also have an ablative function, inhibiting burning of the insulation at liner-to- insulation interfaces. Liner compositions are generally known to those skilled in the 

art. An exemplary liner composition and process for applying the same is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,767,221, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.The combustion of solid rocket propellant generates extreme conditions within the rocket motor casing. For example, temperatures inside the rocket motor casing typically reach 2,760°C (5,000°F). These factors combine to create a high degree of turbulence within the rocket motor casing. In addition, the gases produced during propellant combustion
