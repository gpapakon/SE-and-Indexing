<ABSTRACT>
The invention starts out from a process for producing a setter which is intended to support, with positive contact, a green part placed thereon during a sintering process. A process is to be provided for producing the setter which is matched to the shape of the respective green part to be sintered and which, during sintering, shrinks together with the green part and to the same extent as the latter. This is achieved by the setter being produced using the following process steps from a specific pulverulent material provided with a binder:     a) charging the pulverulent material into a mould, b) pressing the pulverulent material in the closed mould to give a green compact,   c) taking the pressed green compact from the mould,   d) presintering the green compact to give a setter blank, and   e) machining of the setter blank to give the finished setter.
