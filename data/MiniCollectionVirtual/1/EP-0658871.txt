A method and apparatus is disclosed for interleaving the 
transfer of pixel data from a dual bank frame buffer to a memory 

display interface. The interleaved transfer of pixel data to the memory 
display interface enables upgrade of existing memory display interface 

designs to higher density VRAM chips in order to increase the capacity 
of the frame buffer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the architecture of computer graphics
display systems. More particularly this invention relates to a method
and apparatus for interleaving pixel data transfer from a frame buffer to
a memory display interface.In a typical computer graphics system, a video random access
memory (VRAM) frame buffer stores pixel data for rendering images on
a display device. A memory display interface may be employed to
process the pixel data for the display device. The memory display
interface processes the pixel data at programmable pixel rates and pixel
depths, and implements special pixel functions. Pixel processing at
programmable pixel rates enables support of display devices having
differing characteristics (resolution, video timing, etc.), and support of
VRAM frame buffers having differing access speeds. Processing of pixels
having programmable pixel depths increases software compatibility.The capacity of the frame buffer in existing systems can be
increased by upgrading to higher density VRAM chips. The higher
density VRAM chips require less space on a printed circuit board for a
given frame buffer capacity. However, VRAM manufacturers have
increased VRAM chip densities by increasing the number of bit planes in
the VRAMs, rather than by increasing the depth of the VRAMs. For
example, 256K by 4 bit VRAMs have evolved to 256K by 8 bit VRAMs to
provide greater density. The 256K by 8 bit VRAMs reduce by one half the
number of VRAM chips required for a given frame buffer capacity when
compared with 256K by 4 bit VRAMs. Unfortunately, the increased number of bit planes in the higher
density VRAM chips requires an increase in the width of the video bus
between the frame buffer and the memory display interface. For
example, an existing system having eight 256K by 4 bit VRAMs may
have a 32 bit video bus for transferring the pixel data from the frame
buffer to the memory display interface. If the frame buffer capacity is
doubled by upgrading to eight 256K by 8 bit VRAMs, the width of the
video bus must increase to 64 bits to accommodate the increased number
of bit planes. The increased width of the video bus requires a major
redesign of the memory display interface, as well as major modifications
to the printed circuit board layout. The major design modifications
greatly increases the cost of upgrading existing systems.Examples of prior art display interface circuits are disclosed in US-A-5,014,128
(Chen) and in EP-A-0314922 (IBM).As will be described, the present invention is a method and
apparatus
