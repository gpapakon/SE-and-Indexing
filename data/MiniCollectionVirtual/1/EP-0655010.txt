<ABSTRACT>
A spherical logical puzzle is disclosed comprising four interconnected axes defining branches (including 402, 404, 406) to each of which a fixed puzzle segment (202, 204, 206) of arcuate triangular shape is connected, the segment being rotatable about the branch axis; a plurality of free puzzle segments are provided comprising six arcuate square puzzle segments, (e.g. 104) and four arcuate triangular puzzle segments, (e.g. 210) and the free and fixed puzzle segments are coupled together to form a sphere; the segments are capable of adopting a plurality of relative positions and are movable between said relative positions by rotation of some of the segments relative to others in planes perpendicular to said axes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a puzzle. 3-Dimensional logical puzzles which include a plurality of 
segments interlocked to form a cube or regular polyhedron 
have been proposed for example as disclosed in Hungarian 
Patent No. 170,062 to Rubik or US4558866 for Alford. US4558866 also proposes a spherical puzzle design comprised 
of eighteen segments of at least three different shapes. 
Such a puzzle design has the disadvantage of being very 
difficult to manufacture. DD-A-228174 and WO 91/03293 also disclose three dimensional 
puzzles in which puzzle segments are rotatable about four 
non-orthogonal axes. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved 
spherical puzzle design. It is a further object of the invention to provide 3-dimensional 
logical puzzle with increased entertainment 
value. According to the invention there is provided a puzzle  
 
comprising four interconnected non-orthogonal axes defining 
branches to each of which a fixed puzzle segment of arcuate 
triangular shape is connected, the segment being rotatable 
about the branch axes; a plurality of free puzzle segments 
comprising six arcuate square puzzle segments and four 
arcuate triangular puzzle segments, the free and fixed 
puzzle segments being coupled together to form a sphere and 
the segments being capable of adopting a plurality of 
relative positions and being movable between said relative 
positions by relative rotation of some of the segments 
relative to others in planes perpendicular to said axes 
characterised in that a plurality of the segments are 
provided with click/stop means for aligning the segments in 
orientations to allow said relative rotation. In use, a complete half sphere is rotated with respect to 
the other half sphere. There are eight different half 
spheres according to the four rotating axes. A three dimensional representation may be provided on a 
group of said segments in an orientation of the puzzle. Preferably, the three dimensional representation is a 
representation of a cartoon character and is applied in 
raised relief to the segments. Further three dimensional 
representations may be applied to other groups of segments 
of the puzzle.  
 Preferably the or each representation is applied to one 
arcuate square segment and four adjacent arcuate triangular 
segments or, alternatively, to two adjacent arcuate square 
segments and two interposed arcuate triangular segments. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by 
way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings 
in

<CLAIMS>
A puzzle comprising four interconnected non-orthogonal 
axes defining branches (402,404,406) to each of which 

a fixed puzzle segment (202,204,206) of arcuate 
triangular shape is connected, the segment being 

rotatable about the branch axes; a plurality of free 
puzzle segments comprising six arcuate square puzzle 

segments (100) and four arcuate triangular puzzle 
segments (e.g. 210), the free and fixed puzzle 

segments being coupled together to form a sphere and 
the segments being capable of adopting a plurality of 

relative positions and being movable between said 
relative positions by relative rotation of some of the 

segments relative to others in planes perpendicular to 
said axes characterised in that a plurality of the 

segments are provided with click/stop means for 
aligning the segments in orientations to allow said 

relative rotation. 
A puzzle as claimed in claim 1 wherein said branches 
are connected to a centrally disposed boss (400), the 

branches being rotatable relative to said boss. 
A puzzle as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein 
sides of the segments are of the same length.  

 
A puzzle as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 
wherein a plurality of puzzle segments are provided 

with lip (502,504) means each for engaging others of 
the segments to hold the puzzle together. 
A puzzle as claimed in any one of the preceding claims 
wherein a three dimensional, raised relief 

representation is provided on at least two segments in 
one position. 
A puzzle as claimed in claim 5 wherein the 
representation is provided on one arcuate square (100) 

and four adjacent arcuate triangular segments (200). 
A puzzle as claimed in claim 5 wherein the 
representation is provided on two adjacent arcuate 

square segments (100) and two interposed arcuate 
triangular segments (200).
