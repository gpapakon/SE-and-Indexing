<ABSTRACT>
A method for making connections between electric circuits 
(2) disposed on insulating supports (1), comprising the 

steps of mounting a plurality of terminals (7) on said insulating 
supports, and connecting the terminal ends (2a) of 

said electric circuits to said plurality of terminals (7), 
wherein the step of mounting said terminals is carried out 

by the application of a single conductive sheet member (5) 
shaped to present a plurality of outwards projecting tongues 

(6) and a suitable number of projecting tabs to be received 
in corresponding apertures (4) formed in said insulating 

support.
 

The sheet member is positioned so that said tongues (6) 
coincide with respective ones of said terminal ends (2a), 

said tongues being bent back 180
o
 upon themselves to form a 
pair of legs to be clamped onto the respective terminal end 

(2a), said sheet member (5) being subsequently cut at 
selected locations to result in a number of separate sheet 

elements (6a, 6b and/or 6c).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making 
connections between electric circuits disposed on an insulating 
support, including the steps of applying a plurality of 
terminals to said insulating support, said step of applying 
said plurality of terminals is carried out by mounting at least 
one conductive member on said insulating support by inserting 
projections extending therefrom into apertures formed in said 
insulating support, and mechanically and electrically 
connecting terminal ends of said electric circuits to said 
plurality of terminals. The technology for making connections of this type is generally 
known, and is employed in practically identical manner 
by different manufacturers, apart from certain marginal 
variations mainly due to different physical configurations 
of the resistor elements and the associated supports. This technology is substantially based on a manufacturing 
cycle which shall be briefly outlined in the following in 
order to facilitate comparison to the method of the present 
invention to be described subsequently. In the known manufacturing cycle, the first step consists in 
forming the insulating support with a number of apertures at 
locations corresponding to the terminal ends of the resistance 
circuits; the second step consists in connecting the 
terminal ends of the resistance circuits to conductor elements 
adjacent the locations of respective apertures; the 
third step consists in rivetting the conductor elements to 
the insulating support by means of rivets passing through 
respective apertures, to thereby establish reliable mechanical 
and electrical connections of the conductor elements to 
the associated rivets; and the fourth step consists in connecting 
the rivets to respective power supply terminals in a 
per se known manner, for instance by soldering.  
 While this known process is sufficiently simple and safe, it 
suffers from the inconvenience of being a manual process 
throughout; in view of the severe competition in the field 
of large-scale industrial production, this extensive use of 
manual labour results in an inacceptable cost increase, apart 
from the unavoidable occurrence of quality variations. In order to reduce the number of assembly steps, reference 
document DE-A-30 42 417 discloses a method for the connection 
of heater elements with terminals. The terminals are part of a 
conductive member which comprises a rivet type projection. In 
a first step, the rivet type projection is inserted in 
apertures of the insulating
