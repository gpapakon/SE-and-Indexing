<DESCRIPTION>
 ROTATING SCANNER SYSTEM FOR READING MULTIPLE STORAGE LAYER RADIATION SCREENSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field ofthe InventionThe present invention relates to a system and method for reading radiation images stored on storage layer radiation screens. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for reading multiple storage layer radiation screens positioned on a rotating carousel.Description of Related ArtA variety of storage layer radiation screens have been developed for recording radiation images created by exposing the screen to a radiation source, such as x-rays, α-rays, β-rays, γ-rays, cathode rays and ultraviolet rays. When radiation is passed through an object onto the screen, the radiation forms a latent radiation image on the screen by stimulating the storage layer. This latent radiation image can then be read by scanning the screen using a suitable electromagnetic wave radiation, such as visible light or infrared rays (hereinafter referred to as "stimulating rays"), which releases the radiation energy stored in the storage layer as a light emission. The light emitted from the storage layer is then detected and converted into data corresponding to the image. Elimination ofthe image stored in the storage layer may be accomplished by exposing the storage layer for a period of time to a suitable electromagnetic wave radiation. One type of storage layer radiation screen stores the radiation image in the form of an electrical charge distribution at a photo semiconductor layer. An example of this type of storage layer is described in Journal of Applied Photographic Engineering 4 178-182 (1978) which is incorporated herein by reference. Another type of storage layer radiation screen employs a luminophore, such as a phosphorescent material, which becomes excited when exposed to radiation. When the luminophore is exposed to stimulating rays, such as visible light, the luminophore releases energy in the form of light. 

Examples of this type of storage layer are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,859,527 and 4,346,295 which are incorporated herein by reference.As described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,258,264, 4,276,473, 4,315,318 and 4,387,428, stimulable phosphors have been proposed for use as luminophores in radiation image recording and reproducing systems. According to these systems, a screen containing a layer of a stimulable phosphor is exposed to radiation which has passed through an object being imaged, such as a part ofthe human body. The screen is then scanned with
