<DESCRIPTION>
The invention lies in the field of genetic engineering and, in particular, is concerned with
the use of 7B2 as chaperone in vivo or in vitro. The invention accordingly concerns a
method for producing a desired protein in vivo with the aid of recombinant cells capable
of expressing 7B2 and of expressing and secreting said desired protein. Another aspect is
accordingly an in vitro method for the deaggregation or prevention of aggregation of
protein by treating the protein with 7B2.Different transport mechanisms for secretory proteins exist within the eukaryotic cell. All
secretory cells are capable of releasing secretory proteins by protein synthesis at the
endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), via ER to the Golgi apparatus and from the Golgi
apparatus to so-called transport granules. The membrane of a transport granule fuses with
the plasma membrane after which the secretory proteins can leave the cell by exocytosis.
When secretory proteins are made they are also released, in other words there is no
regulation of protein release. This protein transport is subsequently designated the
constitutive secretory route and is present in all eukaryotic cells including yeast.
Prokaryotic cells also have a not regulated, i.e. constitutive, route of protein secretion.The release of certain secretory proteins is known to be regulated in a restricted group of
higher eukaryotic cells. These cells comprise neurons and endocrine cells, in other words
cells producing precursors of bioactive proteins. The synthesis in these cells takes place at
the ER, transport goes from ER to Golgi as in the constitutive cells but then proceeds from
Golgi to secretory granules. In these secretory granules the correct environment is present
for the specific post-translational modifications of the precursors. This type of protein
transport is indicated as the regulated route. The exocytosis of the bioactive proteins only
occurs when the cell undergoes a correct external stimulus. This type of cell is indicated as
a regulated secretory cell.Correct folding of proteins produced by a cell is ensured by molecular chaperone proteins
which are essential for correct functioning of cells as they ensure that proteins produced
by the cells are folded in a correct manner. Correct folding is necessary for correct 
transport of these proteins to the right destination within the cell. Thus, chaperones are not
only necessary for correct protein folding but also for correct protein transport. Specific
chaperone proteins have e.g. been described for protein
