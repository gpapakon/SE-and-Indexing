<ABSTRACT>
Mixing material (M) around inner agitating means (20) in a 
mixing vessel (10) is urged upward and outward by rotating 

the inner agitating means (20) in one direction, and 
simultane-ously, mixing material (M) around outer 

agitating means (30) is urged downward and inward by 
rotating the outer agitating means (30) in the opposite 

direction, consequently to cause the mixing materials 
urged upward and downward to be circulated by convection 

in the mixing vessel (10) and the mixing materials urged 
outward and inward to collide between the inner and outer 

agitating means (20,30), thus forming a high-pressure 
region (T) between the inner and outer agitating means 

(20,30). The mixing materials (M) are mashed in the 
high-pressure region (T) and well mixed in a short time 

with a high efficiency without being agglutinated to the 
inner agitating means (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mixing device and method for
effectively stirring or mixing different materials such as
raw materials for the manufacture of a variety of
concrete.Mixing devices such as a concrete mixer for mixing cement,
water and aggregate to produce cement paste or ready-mixed
concrete are commonly divided into three types. One of
them is a vessel-rotating type mixer (so-called vessel-tilting
type mixer) comprising a rotary vessel and inner
mixing blades fixed inside the mixing vessel. In this
vessel-rotating type mixer, the rotary vessel is rotated
to mix different materials by utilization of free fall of
the materials in the rotating vessel. Thus, this mixer
making use of gravitation is inferior in efficiency.A second type is a so-called pan-type mixer having a
stationary pan-like vessel and a mixing paddle disposed on
the axial centre of the vessel.A third type is a horizontal-paddle type mixer having a
stationary vessel and one or more rotary mixing paddles
horizontally supported in the vessel.The aforementioned vessel-fixed type mixers are now
finding widespread acceptance for actual use. In the
concrete mixer of this type, however, mixing materials are
mixed with a shearing force produced by rotating the
paddles, and therefore, cannot be satisfactorily
circulated by convection in the vessel and well mixed in a
short time.There has been a conventional concrete mixer of the
vessel-fixed type for mixing powder material such as flour
and granular medicines, as shown in FIG. 1. This prior
art concrete mixer has a single agitating spiral screw 2 
vertically sugported in a vessel 4, and a draft cylinder 6
arranged coaxially around the screw 2 so as to circulate
the mixing material in the vessel by convection. That is,
by rotating the screw 2, the mixing material M in the
vessel 4 is caused to move downward inside the draft
cylinder 6 and upward outside the draft cylinder 6.In the case of dealing with sticky mixing materials in the
concrete mixer using such a draft cylinder around the
screw, however, the mixing material M near the screw 2 and
the inner surface of the vessel 4 tends to be prevented
from moving and is stagnated around the regions as
indicated by the symbols T1 and T2 in FIG. 1, consequently
to obtain an mixture insufficiently mixed.Furthermore, the situation that the sticky mixing material
within the draft cylinder 6 is agglutinated to the screw 2
while being mixed becomes a matter of great concern. As a
result, the screw 2 is rotated in sympathy with the mixing
material,
