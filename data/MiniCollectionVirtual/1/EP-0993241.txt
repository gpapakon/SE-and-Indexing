<ABSTRACT>
A process for adhering a polymeric material to a
metal surface, which process comprises the steps of:


i) treating the metal surface with an adhesion
promoting composition comprising 0.1 to 20%

by weight hydrogen peroxide, an inorganic
acid, an organic corrosion inhibitor and a

surfactant in an adhesion promotion step to
form a micro-roughened corrosion-coated

surface; and
 
ii) adhering a polymeric material to the micro-roughened
conversion-coated surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the production of a printed circuit board (PCB), in a first (multi-step) stage, a "bare board" is prepared and in a second (multi-step) stage, various components are mounted on the board. The present invention relates to the first stage in which the bare board is manufactured and to the provision of an adhesion promotion step to improve adhesion within a multi-layer board. A multi-layer board comprises at least one insulating layer and at least one conducting layer which comprises a conducting circuit pattern. The conducting layer is therefore, generally, a discontinuous sub-layer in the form of a circuit pattern. The board may also comprise conductive pads and/or through-holes. The conducting layer pattern and the conductive pads and/or through holes are generally formed from copper. The insulating layers are generally formed from fibreglass bonded with epoxy-based resin.Generally, a bare board is formed from an inner-layer and at least one outer-layer. The expression inner-layer as used in the PCB industry generally refers to a composite of at least two layers (comprising an insulating layer and a conducting layer), or more usually, three layers: a central insulating layer, and on either side, a copper conducting layer. The outer-layer which may be a pre-preg may be a single insulating layer. Alternatively, it may comprise both an insulating layer and a conducting layer.During the manufacture of a PCB, at least one outer layer is adhered to the conducting layer of the inner-layer so that an insulating layer of the outer-layer is innermost, contacting the conducting layer of the inner-layer.Preferably, a multi-layer board will be formed from at least one inner layer and at least two outer layers, one outer layer to be adhered to each conducting layer of the inner-layer.It has been found that in trying to permanently bond a copper conducting layer and an insulating layer to one another, it is difficult to provide a sufficiently strong bond. If a weak bond is formed, during the second manufacturing stage where components are mounted on the board, or later during use, delamination of the board may occur. In particular, the copper surface tends to oxidise on exposure to the atmosphere to form a tarnished layer on its surface. If an insulating layer is adhered directly to this tarnished layer, the bond will be weak and will eventually fail. Many methods of overcoming this problem have been proposed, the most commonly used method is to remove the tarnished layer and to form a strongly adherent copper
