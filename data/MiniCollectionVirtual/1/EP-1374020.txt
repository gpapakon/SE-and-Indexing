<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a simple and reliable cooling device for a computer, comprising a processor (4), mounted on a main board (5), the temperature of which may be maintained at a temperature below ambient, in particular at a negative temperature, by means of an active cooling unit (3), may be achieved, whereby the processor (4) and the main board (5) are placed in a cooled box (6), made from a micro-porous pressed ceramic powder based on a metal oxide, in particular, pyrogenically-created highly-dispersed silicic acid or silicon aerogel.
