<ABSTRACT>
A textile dyed in a non-uniform fashion characterized in that 
it has irregular, random, maculated patterns on its surface 

which vary in shape, size, intensity of colour shading and/or 
colour, and which are distributed in a non-uniform fashion 

over the surface of the textile, whereas other areas are 
undyed or have a light colour.

<DESCRIPTION>
The term "textiles" as used in the present disclosure and 
in the appended claims refers to yarns or threads in the form 
of skeins or wound on a planar structure, plain or textured 
fabrics, cloths, e.g., cotton cloth generally known as "denim," 
and ready-to-wear apparel such as trousers, jeans, jackets, 
sports jackets, shirts, blouses, vests, skirts, shorts, 
swimsuits, etc. It is known that dyeing of textiles may be carried out 
according to a number of different processes, the particular 
process selected generally being related to the material 
to be dyed. Generally, the dyeing process involves charging a textile 
material to a dyeing bath, ordinarily comprising water and a 
dyestuff or dyestuff mixture in either dissolved or dispersed 
form, optionally together with dyeing auxiliaries. The bath is 
heated to a determined temperature for the purpose of making 
the dyestuff penetrate the textile and become fixed to it. The 
dyed product is then repeatedly washed with water to remove any  
 
excess absorbed dyestuff, and it is finally dried. If desired, 
the dyeing process may be followed by a chemical fastening 
treatment to fasten the deposited dyestuff. In turn, the exhausted dyeing bath generally will undergo 
a process to recover or remove the dyestuff(s). Although the foregoing dyeing process is the most 
commonly used, it suffers from several drawbacks. First of 
all, it requires a large amount of water, generally hot water. 
An average dyeing cycle requires from five to more than 100 
liters of water per kg of dyed product, the water typically 
being heated to a temperature of approximately 80° to 130°C. 
Furthermore, the dyeing operation is lengthy and laborious. These drawbacks are greatly increased when a non-uniformly 
dyed product is desired. In this case, the dyeing operation 
may involve several different dyeing cycles, each cycle with a 
different dyestuff, and during each cycle protecting certain 
areas (reserves) which are not to be dyed by that specific 
dyestuff. Printing of fabrics is another technique for producing 
particular patterns. This process requires the use of 
structured blocks to obtain a given pattern. Furthermore, 
while printing can be carried out relatively easily on fabrics, 
difficulties arise when ready-to-wear apparel or a flat portion 
of the ready-to-wear apparel is to be printed. The dyeing processes known in the art make it possible to 
obtain uniform dyeings or well-defined or overlapping patterns,  
 
but do not permit the obtaining of non-uniform,
