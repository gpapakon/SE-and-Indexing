<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a diesel internal combustion engine (1) with an exhaust gas treating device for the reduction of nitrogen oxides and with a fuel injection system (2) which consists of a high-pressure pump (3) and at least one injector (4) controlled by a solenoid valve and in which the injector (4), which is controlled by an electronic control unit (8) is intended both for the primary injection - provided for combustion - and for the additional injection - which influences the action of the exhaust gas treating device (10), the fuel injector provided for the primary injection simultaneously being provided for the secondary injection, which takes place as a follow-on injection at the earliest in the region of the final phase of combustion after ignition TDC.

Air-compressing fuel-injection internal-combustion
engine (1) with an exhaust treatment device

(10), to which reduction agents for the reduction of
nitrogen oxides can be fed, and with a sensor (11; 12)

sensing the temperature in the region of the exhaust
treatment device (10), with a fuel injection system,

comprising a high-pressure pump (3) and at least one
injection nozzle (4) with fuel injection, provided for

the combustion, as primary injection into the
combustion chamber of the fuel-injection engine (1),

and also with at least one secondary injection,
influencing the effectiveness of the exhaust treatment

device (10), both injections taking place with the same
fuel within one operating cycle with a time interval

from each other, characterized in that, in the case of
a fuel injection system with a common-rail system (2)

or electronically actuated unit fuel injector, the
injection nozzle (4) provided for the primary injection

is at the same time an injection nozzle for the
secondary injection which, as a supplementary

injection, takes place at the earliest in the region of
the end phase of the combustion after the ignition top

dead centre in such a way that the supplementary
injection is an early supplementary injection

commencing directly after the starting of the fuel-injection
engine (1), for increasing the temperature of

the exhaust of the exhaust treatment device (10) and/or
that the supplementary injection is a late 

supplementary injection for reducing the nitrogen
oxides of the exhaust treatment device (10).
Air-compressing fuel-injection internal-combustion
engine according to Claim 1, characterized

in that the early supplementary injection commences
after the starting time of the fuel-injection engine in

the region between 20° and 80° after ignition top dead
centre with a time span between t
nST
 = 60 to 300 seconds.
Air-compressing fuel-injection internal-combustion
engine according to Claim 1, characterized

in that the late supplementary injection lies between
80° after ignition top dead centre and the bottom dead

centre region.
Air-compressing fuel-injection internal-combustion
engine according to Claim 1, characterized

in that the sensor (11) sensing the temperature is
arranged in the exhaust flow downstream of the exhaust

treatment device (10).
Air-compressing fuel-injection internal-combustion
engine according to Claim 1, characterized

in that the sensor (12) sensing the temperature senses
the component temperature of the exhaust treatment

device (10).
Air-compressing fuel-injection internal-combustion
engine according to Claim 1, characterized

in that the amount of injection of the supplementary
injection is less than that of the primary injection

provided for the combustion.
