<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the construction and arrangement of wall components (4) which are to be attached to the posts (2) and spars (3) of a basic frame for machines, instruments, equipment and the like. These wall components (4) extend from the middle of one post (2) to the middle of another (2) and are supported on the upper faces of the posts and the spars (3) between them by their folded upper web (8). The side edges (9) of the web (8) extend to approximately the middle of the face of the post and then run obliquely (10) inwards. A section (5) covering the posts (2) at the top is recessed where the web (8) is supported. Running around the inside edge of the wall component (4) there is frame-like spacer (6), the depth of which determines the distance by which the outer wall (7) of the wall component (4) projects beyond the outside of the post.

<CLAIMS>
Basic frame (1) for machines, appliances, structures and 
the like, in which posts (2) and spars (3) mode from light 

metal extrusions are assembled to form a three-dimensional 
framework and connected to wall elements (4), wherein the 

upwardly turned end faces of the posts are closed off by 
profiled covers (5
), for example made from plastics material, 
characterised in that the individual wall element (4) has a 

width which corresponds to the distance between the centres of 
the posts. butts against the outer surfaces of the posts (2) 

with the aid of spacer elements (6) and engages with a bent 
upper flange (8) over a partial zone of the upper end face of 

the post, the profiled cover (5) being recessed (11) in this 
partial zone. 
Basic frame according to Claim 1. characterised in that 
the area of the flange (8) partielly overlapping the end face 

of the post extends. with its edge (9) perpendicular to the 
wall surface, up to approximately the centre of the end face 

of the post and then diagonally inwards (10) up to the corner 
of the end face of the post. 
Basic frame according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
when adjacent wall elements (4) are disposed on corner posts 

(2) their flange edges (10) extending diagonally inwards are 
disposed parallel and spaced from one another and that a 

matching narrow fillet (17) of the profiled cover (5) fills 
this space. 
Basic frame according to claim 1 or one of the following 
claims, characterized in that the surfaces of the flange (8) 

and of the profiled covers (5) are flush with one another 
Basic frame according to Claim 1 or one of the following 
claims, characterised in that the flange (8) of the wall  

 
element (4) engages with an additionally bent flange projection 

(15) around the spar (3) of the basic frame located 
between two posts (2). 
Basic frame according to Claim 1 or one of the following 
claims, characterised in that the wall element (4) engages 

with chamfered lateral edge flanges (15) in continuous grooves 
(14) in the posts (2). 
Basic frame according to Claim 1 or one of the following 
claims, characterised in that the spacer elements (6) are 

constructed as a frame which runs around on the inside along 
the edges of the wall element (4) and forms a physical unit 

with the outer wall (7) of the wall element (4). 
Basic frame according to Claim 1 or 7. characterised in 
that the spacer elements (6) are constructed as sealing 

profiles made from elastic material.
