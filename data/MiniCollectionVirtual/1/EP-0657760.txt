<ABSTRACT>
A phase-contrast DMD based image system 
236
 for projecting an 
amplitude and phase modulated image. A flexure beam DMD array 
234
 is used 
to allow analog phase modulation of reflected light 
238
. The phase modulation 
is converted to amplitude modulation by the phase-contrast imaging optics 

including a phase plate 
124
. The resulting amplitude modulated wave is flicker-free 
and does not need to be synchronized to optical image sensors. 
The arrangement may be incorporated into an image simulation system. 
The resulting syste
m may be used for testing systems and training.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of scene generation systems and more 
particularly to non-visible image simulation systems. This invention also relates 
to field of image projection systems and more particularly to phase contrast 
image projection systems. Image sensors detect electromagnetic radiation from a scene and output 
electrical or optical information extracted from the scene. Examples of systems 
with image sensors include night and inclement weather vision systems and 
forward looking infrared (FLIR) navigation systems. Image sensors are 
becoming more prevalent as the cost to produce such systems decreases and the 
capabilities of such systems increase. As the quantity and complexity of such 
systems has increased, the need for generating and projecting synthetic images 
for input into the image sensors has also grown. There are several difficult 
technical issues associated with image sensors including initial design 
optimization, design verification, production testing, and user training. These 
issues are generally more difficult when dealing with non-visible systems than 
with visual systems. Present non-visible image simulation systems typically 
provide insufficient resolution, marginal contrast ratios, low frame or update 
rates, image smearing and excessive persistence due to the emission from the 
projection device. Present systems are typically designed for use only with a 
single image sensor and typically do not create phase information within images. State of the art infrared systems production testing methods typically 
inject an electrical test signal for the sensor system to process. Signal injection is 
not an optimum test method because the image detector with its related  
 
electronics and associated gimbals and optics are not tested. The optics and 
detector of the system are usually tested separately using a very simple static 
scene or test pattern or a very slowly moving, but somewhat more complex series 
of synthetic scenes. This two-part test methodology does not perform an end-to-end 
test of the entire system. Providing a realistic image for input to the image 
sensor has often required field testing the image sensor which can be very 
expensive for complex systems. A need exists in the art for an image projection 
system that can generate and project high-quality images both in real-time and 
non-real-time, for input into an image sensor. Spatial light modulators (SLM) are used to modulate radiant energy, such 
as visible and non-visible light, in optical
