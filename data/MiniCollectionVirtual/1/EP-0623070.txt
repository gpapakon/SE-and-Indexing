<ABSTRACT>
A high-opacity cellulose-free synthetic paper (58) is formed from a wet-laid nonwoven web of thermoplastic fibers (44), all or most of which fibers are made of a predetermined polymeric material. The wet-laid web is dried to remove excess water (46), drying (48) being carried out at temperatures below the melting temperature of the predetermined polymeric material. The dried nonwoven web is saturated on at least one side with a pigmented binder (50) forming a continuous coating thereon. The binder is cured at temperatures below the melting temperature (54) of the predetermined polymeric material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to synthetic paper
made on conventional continuous wet-lay papermaking
equipment. In particular, the invention relates to
recyclable polymeric synthetic paper made of 100%
polymeric material.The invention also relates to labels, especially
to labels adapted for use in labeling of blow-molded
plastic containers. In particular, the label comprises
a coated 100% synthetic web prepared by a wet-lay
process. The label may be applied either in-mold or
post-mold to a blow-molded container made of the same
synthetic material as the main synthetic fiber component
(for example, polyethylene, polyester or polypropylene)
of the label with or without the use of an adhesive
material and may be recycled along with the container.It is conventional practice to make synthetic paper
using synthetic pulp comprising short fibers of
polyethylene. Such synthetic paper is made using
polyethylene pulp with or without cellulose fibers.
Such flexible polymeric synthetic substrates are used
to make water-resistant cardboard, embossed paper, heat-sealing
paper, battery separators, felt mats, hygienic
absorbents and building materials. To meet the demands
of various applications, many grades of polyethylene
have become commercially available. These synthetic
pulp products use polyethylenes of different physical 
properties. Polypropylene and polypropylene/polyethylene
products are also known.U.S. Patent No. 5,047,121 to Kochar discloses a
process for making synthetic paper containing at least
97 wt.% polyethylene on conventional continuous wet-lay
papermaking equipment. The process includes the steps
of: (1) preparing a pulp furnish comprising 97-99.5 wt.%
polyethylene fibers and 0.5-3.0 wt.% polyvinyl alcohol
binder fibers; (2) depositing the pulp furnish on the
screen of a wet-lay papermaking machine to form a
waterleaf sheet; (3) drying the resulting waterleaf
sheet on heated drying cans having a drying profile
wherein an initial drying phase is provided at a
temperature between 200°F and 270°F to melt the
polyvinyl alcohol fibers and a second drying phase is
provided at a temperature between 190°F and 240°F to
control stretch and elongation of the sheets; and (4)
thermally bonding the dried sheet at a temperature
between 250°F and 315°F to provide polyethylene paper.
The thermal bonding can be accomplished with a calendar
roll. The Kochar patent teaches that: (1) the strength
of the synthetic paper can be tailored by varying the
amount of polyvinyl alcohol fibers mixed into the
polyethylene pulp;
