<ABSTRACT>
An image printer includes a projection-exposure 
section for projecting an image born on a film onto a 

photosensitive material, an image-exposure section for 
exposing the photosensitive material based on image 

information comprised of a plurality of image areas 
each including color data relating to a plurality of 

colors, and a transport unit for transporting the 
photosensitive material through the projection-exposure 

section and the image-exposure section. The 
image-exposure section includes a plurality of 

exposure units for dividing the image information into 
a plurality of lines and exposing the photosensitive 

material with switching exposing colors corresponding 
to the plurality of color data, a moving device for 

moving the plurality of exposure units and the 
photosensitive material relative to each other in a 

direction perpendicular to the lines, and a moving-exposure 
control unit for controlling operations of 

the exposure units and the moving device. The 
exposure control unit is capable of effecting a moving 

exposure control in which the plurality of exposure 
units respectively effect exposure operations thereof 

in a parallel manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image printer, and more particularly to an
image printer including a projection-exposure section for projecting an image
born on a film onto a photosensitive material, an image exposure section for exposing
the photosensitive material based on image information comprised of a
plurality of image areas each including color date relating to a plurality of colors,
and transport means for transporting the photosensitive material through the
projection-exposure section and the image-exposure section.Such image printer as described above may be used for a variety of purposes. For
instance, the printer allows the projection-exposure section and the image-exposure
section to be utilized independently of each other. The printer is also usable
for a multiple exposure operation. In this case, the projection-exposure section
effects an exposure of the film image onto a certain portion of the photosensitive
material and also the image-projection section effects a further overlapping exposure
of another image onto the same portion of the photosensitive material while
the photosensitive material is being transported by the transport means through
the projection-exposure section and the image-exposure section.
Conventionally, the image-exposure section of the above-described image printer
effects an exposure of a video image displayed on a CRT monitor onto the photosensitive 
material, the video image being comprised of a plurality of image areas
each including color data relating to a plurality of colors.Document US 4,878,111 discloses an image apparatus which projects a transparent
image onto a photomaterial. This apparatus comprises a CRT and a screen
image produced by said CRT is reproduced on the photomaterial. The CRT is
controlled by image measuring means reading image data and a computer unit
for the purpose of color and contrast correction by means of the CRT.Document EP 0 615 378 A1 (prio. date: 12/03/93, publ date: 14/09/94) which was published after the priority date of this
application shows an image printer including a protection-exposure section for
protecting a film image onto a photosensitive material, an image exposure section
for exposing the photosensitive material based on image information and a
reader device for reading the image information of the film image which the image
information being devided into a plurality of areas. The image exposure section
comprises a projection unit, an optical path connected to the projection unit,
a light-modulating filter and

<CLAIMS>
An image printer having:

a projection-exposure section (P) for projecting an image born on a
film (2) onto a photosensitive material (3);
reading means (15) for reading image information on the film (2), the
image information being comprised of a plurality of image areas each

including color data relating to a plurality of colors;
an image-exposure section (G) for exposing the photosensitive material
(3) based on the image information,
transport means (H) for transporting the photosensitive material (3)
through the projection-exposure section (P) and the image-exposure

section (G); 
characterized in that

the image-exposure section (G) comprises:

a single exposure means (34) for dividing said photosensitive
material (3) into a plurality of adjacent parallel lines and exposing in sequence one line after the other on said

photosensitive material (3) based on said color data for each line of
said photosensitive material (3);
projection means (RE) for projecting light onto the photosensitive
material (3) and switching over a plurality of exposing colors, the

projection means (RE) including:

a plurality of projection units (F); each projection unit (F)
projecting an exposing color different from an exposing color of

other projection units;
a plurality of optical paths formed by a plurality of respective optical fibers (46), each
path corresponding to one of said projection units and guiding the

light of this projection unit to said single exposure means (34); 
and a plurality of exposing-color control shutters (33r, 33g, 33b)
each interposed between a respective projection unit and

the ends of the corresponding optical fibres
for independently and selectively opening/closing said plurality of

optical paths.
An image printer as defined in Claim 1, 
characterized in that

said exposing-color control shutters (33r, 33g, 33b) are electronic shutters.
An image printer as defined in Claim 1, 
characterized in that

a diffusing member (47) for diffusing the light beam projected from the
optical fibers (46) is provided on the side of the optical fiber (46) opposite to the side

corresponding to the plurality of exposure-color control shutters (33r, 33g, 33b).
An image printer as defined in claim 3, 
characterized in that

said single exposure means (34) include a plurality of exposure-control shutters
(30S) for opening/closing the light from the diffusing member (47) so as to divide the

light into a plurality of areas, and a SELFOC (registered trade mark of Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd.) lens alley (34c)
for converging the respective light beam components opened/closed

through the exposure control shutters (30S) on said photosensitive
material (3).
