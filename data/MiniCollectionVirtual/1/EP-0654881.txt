<ABSTRACT>
An installation equipment (1) for electrical installation, which can be fastened in flush-mounted boxes (3) by means of spreading claws (2), the spreading claws being held, such that they can move in a tilting manner, on parts of the supporting bracket (4) and/or on the equipment base and it being possible to move them into their spread position, against the force of a retracting (resetting) means, by means of adjusting screws (5) which act on a limb end (6) which is bent inwards towards the equipment base. It is intended that in each case one body (7), which is in the form of a rod and is made of sprung material, is held by means of its ends (8) on the supporting bracket or on the equipment base as the retracting (resetting) means and, on the underneath, rests on the spreading claw, which is guided in a window (9) such that it springs outwards and lifts said spreading claw in this case against an upper window boundary (10), as the bearing point.

<CLAIMS>
Installation device (1) of electrical 
installation, which can be fastened by means of 

expanding claws (2) in flush-type boxes (3), whereby 
the expanding claws are supported with a tilting motion 

on parts of the bracket (4) and/or on the base of the 
device and are to be brought into their expanded 

position against the force of resetting means by way of 
adjusting screws (5) which engage with a limb end (6) 

bent inwards to the base of the device, whereby the 
resetting means consist of resilient material and at 

the underside abut with rebound the expanding claw 
guided in a window (9) and in this respect lifts the 

expanding claw against an upper window boundary (10) as 
bearing, characterized in that as resetting means in 

each case a bar-shaped body (7) is provided, which is 
supported with its ends (8) on the bracket or on the 

base of the device. 
Installation device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the bar-shaped body (7) is spaced 

apart from the intended plane of the window by bars 
(11) between its supports at the bracket and its 

support at the expanding claw. 
Installation device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the expanding claws (2) have 

shaped parts (12), such as knubs or flaps which are cut 
out and bent, which widen the shaped cross section of 

the expanding claws, so that with a consequently 
suitable bending of the expanding claw with a small 

bending radius and relatively straight limb the 
expanding claw with its relatively straight limb area 

passes through the window (9) and with corresponding 
inclination (13) of the window-forming area and/or the 

shaping of the upper window boundary (14) abuts the 
outer window edge (15). 
Installation device according to one of claims  
 

1 to 3, characterized in that the bar-shaped body (7) 
is supported in pockets (17) of the bracket (4). 
Installation device according to one of claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the window is constructed 

in a bracket area. 
Installation device according to one of claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the bar-shaped body (7) 

is manufactured from spring steel.
