<ABSTRACT>
A mercury-free position switch has a housing (1) made of an insulating material, such as glass, with at least two straight or bent wire electrodes (3, 3', 4, 4') that enter the housing. The housing (1) is partially filled with an electroconductive liquid (2) which establishes or breaks a contact between the electrodes (3, 4) according to the position of the position switch. At least one electrode (4, 4') is surrounded by an insulating material (5) at its point of entry in the housing. Switching occurs sharply at a certain distance from the wall of the housing both when contact is made or broken by means of the fluid.
