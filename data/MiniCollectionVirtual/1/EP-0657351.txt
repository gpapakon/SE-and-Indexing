<ABSTRACT>
An aircraft subsystem provides the aircraft with all its electrical and 
conditioned air requirements without requiring the extraction of either 

shaft power and/or pressurized air from the aircraft's main engines. At the 
core of this subsystem are two rotating assemblies journaled on non-oil 

lubricated bearings to a housing. One assembly includes a cooling 
turbine (28), a starter/generator (30), a core compressor (32), 

and a high pressure 
stage (34) of a two stage axial turbine, all mounted 

on a single shaft (22). A 
combustor (36) is disposed between the core compressor and the turbine. 

The other assembly is comprised of a the low pressure 
stage (38) of the axial 

turbine coupled to a load compressor (40) via a second shaft (42). 
The high 

pressure turbine stage and cooling turbine are sized to drive the core 
compressor and starter/generator which provides all the aircraft's 

electrical needs both on the ground and inflight. The low pressure 
turbine stage drives the load compressor, which produces pressurized air 

that is conditioned through heat exchange components and then 
expanded and cooled across the cooling turbine before being delivered 

to the aircraft cabin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to aircraft subsystems, and in 
particular to an aircraft subsystem that provides electricity and 
conditioned air to the aircraft independently of the main propulsion 
engines, thereby increasing the fuel efficiency of the engines. In addition to propulsion, aircraft main engines also provide shaft 
power through a gearbox to drive electric generators, hydraulic pumps, 
and fuel pumps. They also provide pressurized air for the environmental 
control system, which uses this air to cool or heat , ventilate, and 
pressurize the aircraft cabin. The extraction of pressurized air and shaft 
power from the main engines is referred to as parasitic loss, and must be 
compensated for by increasing the fuel flow to the main engines. It has 
long been a goal of aircraft and aircraft engine designers to minimize or 
eliminate these parasitic losses, and thereby improve the fuel efficiency 
of the main engines. In particular, it has been recognized that the 
electrical generators and environmental control systems are the two 
largest sources of parasitic losses. When the aircraft is on the ground and the main engines are 
shutdown, many types of aircraft employ an auxiliary gas turbine engine 
to supply pressurized air for environmental control systems or main 
engine starting, and shaft horsepower to drive accessories such as an 
electric generator. Recent technological advances now enable these 
engines to be started and operated inflight in an emergency such as a 
main engine shutdown, however, under normal inflight operating 
conditions the burden of providing electricity and pressurized air still falls 
on the main engines. Cronin, U.S. Patent No. 4,494,372 discloses a multi-role 
primary/auxiliary power system for an aircraft that provides electrical, 
mechanical, and air conditioning power as well as main engine starting  
 
functions. Although this system eliminates the parasitic loss due the 
extraction of air from the main engine, it still needs mechanical power 
from the main engine to provide electrical power to the aircraft. Similarly, 
Cronin, U.S. Patent no. 4,684,081 discloses a multifunction power system 
that combines an auxiliary power unit, environmental control system, 
engine start system, and emergency power system for an aircraft. This 
system also does not require pressurized air from the engine, however, in 
the flight cooling mode electrical power is extracted from the main 
engines to power the system. The preamble of claim 1 is 
based on the disclosure of
