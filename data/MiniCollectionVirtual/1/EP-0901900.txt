<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of melt-fabricable fluoropolymers, and is
specifically concerned with laminates of melt-fabricable fluoropolymer
compositions and metal.Fluoropolymer resins, and especially perfluoropolymer resins, are
known for their low surface energy and antistick properties, and thermal and
chemical resistance. These copolymers do not stick to other materials, especially
dissimilar materials, with any practical degree of bond strength.Some high temperature resistant thermoplastics (HTRP), such as
polyamide imide, polyarylene sulfide and polyether sulfone, have found use as
adhesion promoters in fluoropolymer coating formulations. See, for example U.S.
Patents 5,230,961 (Tannenbaum) and 5,093,403 (Rau et al.). However, such
adhesion promoters are typically used in relatively high proportions which can
detract from the properties of the fluoropolymer. For example, U.S. Patent
5,230,961 claims (Claim 7) a coated substrate wherein the primer contains
15-30% of polyamide imide and 25-55% of perfluoropolymer, and TABLE 14 of
U.S. Patent 5,093,403 gives primer formulations containing 15-20 wt% of
polyphenylene sulfide or polyetheretherketone.There remains a need for laminates of melt-flowable fluoropolymer to
dissimilar materials, notably metals, in which the fluoropolymer component has
good adhesion to the metal at high fluoropolymer content, so that the
fluoropolymer component of the laminate substantially retains the thermal and
chemical resistance of fluoropolymer.This invention provides a laminate of metal and melt-fabricable
fluoropolymer composition adhered thereto, said composition comprising
functionalized fluoropolymer resin, high temperature resistant thermoplastic
resin adhesion promoter, and a major portion of melt fabricable non-functional
fluoropolymer as defined in claim 1. The composition exhibits synergistic enhanced adhesion to metal,
so that a laminate 
having good adhesion between components is obtained with a fluoropolymer
composition having a relatively low concentration of high temperature resistant
thermoplastic (adhesion promoter) and, thus, predominantly fluoropolymer
character.It has been discovered that a combination of functionalized
fluoropolymer and high temperature resistant thermoplastic (HTRP) results in a
. synergistic increase in the adhesion of the composition to metal. When both
components are present, the adhesion result is better than would be predicted from
adhesion results when only one of these components is present. In one aspect,
notably, the
