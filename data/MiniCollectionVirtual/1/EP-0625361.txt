<ABSTRACT>
Very low frequency and very short duration sequential 
variable magnetic field generating system, of the type 

comprising a feed source and a frequency inlet, as 
well as a frequency synthesizer to obtain two signals of 

different duration, using one as a control signal to charge 
a condenser and a second one to discharge it, so that at 

the inlet of the two signals obtained with the synthesizer, 
there are respective triggers-separators (5) and (6) to 

activate both switches.

<DESCRIPTION>
As is expressed in the title of the present specification, 
the following invention consists of a very low 
frequency and very short duration sequential variable 
magnetic field generating system, which is applicable 
essentially to inducing sleep, relaxation, reducing 
stress, etc., in a way similar to how it is achieved by 
autogenous training. The proposed system is based on discharging a condenser 
through a very low resistance conductor, which will 
cause in connection with the latter, magnetic fields whose 
duration will be that of the discharge, and whose intensity 
will depend on the capacity of the condenser just like the 
discharge time for a specific conductor. The conducting strip, proposed as a transducer, has 
the advantage that it is easy to place in any seat, mattress 
or place of rest in general, along the spine of the 
corresponding person. When we want to induce electric currents in the human 
body, coils with a larger or smaller number of spirals are 
traditionally used, which makes them difficult to adapt to 
mattresses, backs of chairs, etc. On the other hand, the type of electric pulses generated, 
to obtain the corresponding magnetic pulses, tend 
to be square waves. As the induced current, which is that 
which is going to be used, is obtained only during the 
variation of the field, this causes a loss of part of the 
useless energy in the area of the wave, in which the current 
is constant in the generator, which in turn makes 
the support material (conductor) heat up unnecessarily. Patent of invention 538.259 claims an electronic 
system to generate variable frequency magnetic impulses  
 
from the frequency of the feed network, constituted of 
a circuit that comprises a feed source, a control block, 
an automatically controllable switch and a transducer. The feed source, is formed by an alternating current-direct 
current convertor, that has means for generating 
oscillation with a standard or reference frequency, the 
value thereof being, equal or proportional to the characteristic 
frequency of the alternating current of the feed 
network. The control block is formed by a pulse counter or 
frequency divider, which receives the reference pulses 
from the feed network, and each "n" pulse received lets 
one pass, in other words, it acts as a programmable or 
choosable "n" divider. The signal obtained in said control block or frequency 
divider is applied to a bipolar power step, which is 
comprised of a monostable element or else by a simple coil 
and a power step, so that the

<CLAIMS>
Very low frequency and very short duration sequential 
variable magnetic field generating system, of the type 

that is comprised of a feed source and a frequency inlet, 
as well as a frequency synthesizer, to obtain two signals 

of a different duration, one used as a control signal, 
to charge a condenser, and the second one to discharge it, 

essentially characterized in that at the input of the two 
signals (Sp1 and Sp2) obtained with the frequency synthesizer, 

respective triggers-separators (5 and 6) are found 
to activate both solid state switches (7) and (8), so that 

upon the signal (Sp1) being positive the signal (Sp2) is zero, 

and the switch (7) activates permitting the condenser C1 (9) 
to charge through the resistor R1 (10), while the switch (7) 

closes, the switch (8) receives the signal (Sp2) becoming 
active again, the condenser C1 (9) discharging through the 

resistor R2 (11) and the conducting strip (12), comprised 
of several in bridge conductors, which will create a field 

around it acting upon the person on the desired area.
