A heating furnace (2) heats a workpiece to be plated. An
ingot preheating furnace (8) encloses an ingot carrying device

(7) that carries ingots (6) to a place near a melting furnace
(3) that melts the ingots (6) of a plating material, contains

the molten plating material in which a workpiece to be plated
is immersed. The ingot preheating furnace (8) preheats the

ingots (6) supported by the ingot carrying device (7) at a
temperature below the melting point of the ingots (6) by an exhaust

gas (G) discharged from the heating furnace (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hot dipping apparatus 
employed in a manufacturing line for manufacturing hot-dip 
zinc-coated steel sheets or the like. A hot dipping apparatus for manufacturing hot-dip 
zinc-coated steel sheets carries out a pretreatment process, such 
as a continuous heating process for heating steel sheets or a 
continuous annealing process for annealing steel sheets. A 
steel sheet unwound from a steel sheet coil is passed through 
a heating furnace and a zinc melting furnace successively for 
continuous processing. The zinc melting furnace is replenished 
intermittently with zinc ingots of a room temperature as zinc 
molten therein is consumed. Zinc ingots to be supplied into the 
zinc melting furnace are carried to a place near the zinc melting 
furnace by an ingot carrying device. It is preferable to maintain 
the molten zinc melted in the zinc melting furnace at temperatures 
in the range of a predetermined temperature plus and minus 2 °C 
to maintain constant zinc plating quality. An exhaust gas 
discharged from the heating furnace is discharged into the 
atmosphere after being used for preheating combustion air to be 
supplied into the heating furnace by a heat exchanger. In the conventional hot dipping apparatus, a zinc ingot 
of about 1 t having a room temperature, which is far lower than 
the melting point (460 °C) of zinc, is supplied into the zinc 
melting furnace. If a zinc ingot of 1 t is dumped at a time into 
the zinc melting furnace, the temperature of molten zinc contained 
in the zinc melting furnace drops and zinc plating quality becomes 
unstable. A zinc ingot may be gradually immersed in molten zinc 
contained in the zinc melting furnace by using a hoist to prevent 
zinc plating quality from becoming unstable, which, however, 
requires skill and labor. It is not easy to maintain the 
temperature of molten zinc within the predetermined temperature 
range. It is possible to use an ingot supply device that grips  
 
a zinc ingot and immerses the zinc ingot gradually and 
automatically in the molten zinc, which, however, makes system 
configuration complicated. The exhaust gas discharged from the 
heating furnace still has a high temperature in the range of 350 
to 450 °C after the same has been used for heating combustion 
air to be supplied into the heating furnace by the heat exchanger. 
Therefore, the discharge of the high-temperature exhaust gas into 
the atmosphere reduces the thermal efficiency of the hot dipping 
apparatus. The present invention has been
