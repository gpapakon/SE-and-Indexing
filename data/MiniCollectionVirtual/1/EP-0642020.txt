<ABSTRACT>
The method for determining the degree of lithogenesis activity and the composition of lithogenic urine salts comprises adding appropriately to a sample of urine an aqueous protein solution in a ratio of 9:1, 7:1 or 5:1, applying the resulting mixture in the form of a drop to a flat surface and drying within at least 24 hours, then determining the mode of salt crystallisation in the edge zone of the sample, concluding whether the degree of lithogenesis activity is weak, moderate or pronounced in the presence of single crystals, conglomerates thereof or complete crystallisation of this zone, and determining the composition of these crystals formed with parallel determination of the salt composition in the central zone of the sample and on later performance of a comparative analysis of these compositions for the purpose of determining the lithogenic urine salts.

<CLAIMS>
A method of determining the degree of stone formation activity and the composition of
stone-forming urine salts in the case of urolithiasis through adding an aqueous protein

solution to a urine specimen, applying the obtained mixture to a plane surface in the form
of a drop, drying within 24 hours and determining the type of salt crystallisation in the

edge zone of the specimen, characterised in that the protein solution is added to the urine
specimen in the ratio 9:1, 7:1 or 5:1, and in that with the presence of individual crystals,

their conglomerates or with total crystallisation of this zone, conclusions are drawn
regarding a low, moderate or marked degree of stone formation activity, and the

composition of these crystalline formations is determined accompanied by parallel
determination of the salt composition in the central zone of the specimen and with a

comparative analysis of these compositions being carried out subsequently for the
purpose of determining the stone-forming urine salts.
A method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that a 8 - 12% aqueous albumin
solution is used as an aqueous protein solution.
A method in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that drying of a mixture drop
applied to the plane surface takes place at room temperature.
A method in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that an X-ray
spectrometric microanalysis is carried out to determine the element composition of

crystalline formations.
