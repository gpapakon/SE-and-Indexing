<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improved silyl linkers, methods for their
preparation and their use in the solid phase synthesis of aromatic carbocycles,
especially electron deficient aromatic carbocycles.In the continuing search for new chemical moieties that can effectively
modulate a variety of biological processes, the standard method for conducting a
search is to screen a variety of pre-existing chemical moieties, for example,
naturally occurring compounds or compounds which exist in synthetic libraries or
databanks. The biological activity of the pre-existing chemical moieties is
determined by applying the moieties to an assay which has been designed to test a
particular property of the chemical moiety being screened, for example, a receptor
binding assay which tests the ability of the moiety to bind to a particular receptor
site.In an effort to reduce the time and expense involved in screening a large
number of randomly chosen compounds for biological activity, several
developments have been made to provide libraries of compounds for the discovery
of lead compounds. The chemical generation of molecular diversity has become a
major tool in the search for novel lead structures. Currently, the known methods for
chemically generating large numbers of molecularly diverse compounds generally
involve the use of solid phase synthesis, in particular to synthesize and identify
peptides and peptide libraries. See, for example, Lebl et al., Int. J. Pept. Prot. Res.,
41, p. 201 (1993) which discloses methodologies providing selectively cleavable
linkers between peptide and resin such that a certain amount of peptide can be
liberated from the resin and assayed in soluble form while some of the peptide still
remains attached to the resin, where it can be sequenced; Lam et al., Nature, 354, p.
82 (1991) and (WO 92/00091) which disclose a method of synthesis of linear
peptides on a solid support such as polystyrene or polyacrylamide resin; Geysen et
al., J. Immunol. Meth., 102, p. 259 (1987) which discloses the synthesis of peptides
on derivatized polystyrene pins which are arranged on a block in such a way that
they correspond to the arrangement of wells in a 96-well microtiter plate; and
Houghten et al., Nature, 354, p. 84 (1991) and WO 92/09300 which disclose an 
approach to de novo determination of antibody or receptor binding sequences
involving soluble peptide pools.The major drawback, aside from technical considerations, with all of these
methods for lead generation is the quality of the lead. Linear peptides
