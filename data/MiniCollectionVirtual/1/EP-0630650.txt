<ABSTRACT>
Reaction of 1 - 5.5 M nitric acid with 45 to 170 mmol primary C1-C5-alkanol per l of nitric acid results in an improved preparation for local treatment of skin and mucosal changes and of infections of the skin and mucosa. The preparation consists of 1 - 5.5 M nitric acid, not more than 170 mmol of C1-C5-alkanoic acid per l of solution and nitrate reduction products in a concentration which corresponds to 0.1 to 6 mg of nitrite per ml of solution. It is distinguished by good efficacy and a low risk of side effects.
