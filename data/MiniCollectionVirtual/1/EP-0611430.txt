<ABSTRACT>
A butterfly valve comprises: an elongate valve body (1) having a flange (2) at one end, a valve plate (4), operable between an open and closed position, forming a seal with the said flange (2) in the closed position, and a valve plate support structure including: a location cam (14) seated within an abutment plate housing (10), and operable to effect movement of the valve plate (4); a shaft (5), operable to effect movement of the cam by rotational movement of the shaft; and an abutment plate (12), formed within the abutment plate housing (10); wherein rotational movement of the said shaft (5) will result in independent rotational movement and linear movement of the said location cam (14) within the abutment plate housing (10) and operable to effect independent rotational movement and linear movement of the valve plate (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
 BUTTERFLYVALVEWITHCOMPOUNDMOVEMENTThe present invention resides in a valve system, and in particular to a valve system that is applicable for use in a gas stream.It is essential that valves, particularly those valves that are used in a gas stream, provide an efficient seal to prevent gas leakage. Typical valves that are used in such systems include a leaf valve or a plate valve. Such valves usually involve a simple one step action to move the valve from a closed to an open position. In the case of a plate valve, such movement is usually a rotational movement wherein the plate is associated with a shaft, and rotation of the shaft causes the rotation of the plate.In order to ensure an adequate seal, O-rings or other such seals are either positioned around the plate or valve disk itself, to ensure an adequate seal. In time, such seals may wear, or alternatively simply fail to seal the valve adequately due to the imprecise nature of the valve.Alternatively, a flange may be associated with a pipe or channel through which the gas, or other such fluid will flow. The flange will assist in the sealing of the valve by abutting against the plate when in a closed position. Again, the effectiveness of such sealing may be inhibited given the imprecise positioning of the valve relative to the flange, and fail to provide a positive seal for the gas stream.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to overcome or at least alleviate one or more of the difficulties associated with the. prior art.The present invention resides in a valve system comprising; 

 an elongate valve body having a flange at one end,a valve plate, operable between an open and closed position, forming a seal with the said flange in the closed, position, anda valve plate support structure including;a cam seated within an abutment plate housing, and operable to effect movement of the valve plate;a shaft, operable to effect movement of the cam by rotational movement of the shaft; andan abutment plate, formed within the abutment plate housing;wherein rotational movement of the said shaft will result in independent rotational movement and linear movement of the said cam within the abutment plate housing and operable to effect independent rotational movement and linear movement of the valve plate.The mechanism of the present invention allows for an efficient valve seal mechanism, sufficiently effective to provide a positive seal against gas flowing through a gas stream.Preferably, the cam is constructed of a hardened material such as steel or

CLAIMS
1. A valve system comprising; an elongate valve body having a flange at one end,
a valve plate, operable between an open and closed position, forming a seal with the said flange in the closed position, and
a valve plate support structure including;
a location cam seated within an abutment plate housing, and operable to effect movement of the valve plate;
a shaft, operable to effect movement of the cam by rotational movement of the shaft; and
an abutment plate, formed within the abutment plate housing;
wherein rotational movement of the said shaft will result in independent rotational movement and linear movement of the said location cam within the abutment plate housing and operable to effect independent rotational movement and linear movement of the valve plate.
2. A valve system according to claim 1, wherein said cam is substantially ring shaped having a substantially round circumference with a shaped portion to interact with the said abutment plate,
said shaft having an eccentric axis with said cam and a concentric axis with said abutment plate housing,
wherein said cam is seated within the abutment plate housing, in such a manner that the cam undergoes rotation within the abutment plate housing until such time that said shaped portion coincides with said abutment 


 plate, wherein further rotational movement of the shaft results in linear movement of the cam.
3. A valve system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the cam is also seated within a cam housing and secured into the cam housing such that movement of the cam will result in comparable movement of the cam housing, the cam housing being associated with the valve plate, such that movement of the cam housing causes resultant movement of the valve plate.
4. A valve system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein rotational movement of the cam results in rotational movement of the valve plate, and linear movement of the cam results in a linear movement of the valve plate toward said flange.
5. A valve system, according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the flange includes an angled surface facing the valve plate, such that linear movement of the valve plate toward the flange will result in the valve plate being forced into the angled surface of the flange, to create a positive seal.
6. A valve system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the valve plate has an associated O-ring or resilient seal surrounding its circumference to form a seal with said flange.
7. A valve system according to any one of the preceding claims, further including a washer surrounding the cam, and located to provide a smooth surface for the valve plate to move relative to the valve body.
8. A valve system according to claim 7, wherein the washer is made of teflon.
9. A valve system according to any one of the preceding claims, including a plate support system on 


 opposite sides of the valve plate, said shaft extending to connect and operate said plate support systems, and to provide a pivotal axis for said valve plate.
10. A valve system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said abutment plate is made of hardened steel and is removably affixed to the abutment plate housing.
11. A valve system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the shaft extends beyond the valve body to allow for actuation of the shaft.
12. A valve system, according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the rotation of the shaft is actuated by mechanical means.
13. A valve system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the valve body includes a flange at either end.
14. A valve system according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the cam housing is formed integrally with the valve plate.
15. A valve system according to claim 1, substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to any one of the drawings.
