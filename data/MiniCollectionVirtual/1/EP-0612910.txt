<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a termination border (3) for metal doors, the lower end of which is formed by two metal sheets (1, 2) running parallel to the plane of the door leaf. In order to increase the mechanical strength of the lower door region, it is provided that the termination border (3) exhibits protrusions (4, 5), projecting upwards and located between the metal door sheets (1, 2), and protrusions (6, 7) which project outwards essentially by the thickness of the sheet metal.

rounded beads (8,9), between which there is provided a 

recess (10) extending substantially in the plane of the 
door leaf. 
A sealing strip connector according to Claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that in its plane of symmetry, on 

the side nearest the floor, it is provided with an 
indentation (11). 
A sealing strip connector according to Claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that in its plane of symmetry it 

has spaced apart holes for receiving screws.
