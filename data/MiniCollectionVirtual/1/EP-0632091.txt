<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sorbitol derivatives useful as 
nucleators and clarifiers in polyolefin resin compositions and 
to polyolefin resin compositions in which such derivatives are 
included, thus imparting improved transparency and improved 
crystallization response. Polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene have 
found extensive use as packaging materials and containers in 
the form of films, sheets or hollow articles. However, since 
polyolefins tend to have poor transparency, they cannot fully 
meet the demand for packaging materials or containers which 
permit their contents to be viewed from the outside. It is generally known to use nucleators and clarifiers to 
reduce product molding cycle times by allowing the polyolefins 
to which they are added to be crystallized at higher 
temperatures during injection and blow molding operations. 
Polyolefins containing such additives require less time in the 
mold for cooling and the finished product has smaller 
crystals, resulting in decreased light scattering and improved 
clarity. The preparation and purification of dibenzylidene 
sorbitol is disclosed in U.S. 3,721,682, U.S. 4,131,612 and 
U.S. 4,267,110; these references also disclose uses which 
include gelling of organic liquids and clarifying polyolefin 
resins. Dibenzylidene sorbitol has been proposed as an 
additive (Japanese Patent Application No. 94424/1974) to 
improve transparency, but this additive had reported 
compatibility limitations with polyolefin resins. The  
 
addition of a small amount of tribenzylidene sorbitol to 
dibenzylidene sorbitol improved compatibility with polyolefin 
resins (U.S. 4,267,110), but it was later reported that it 
tended slightly to bleed out onto the surface of the resulting 
molded article, and therefore the surface of the molded 
article tended to collect static charges and become 
contaminated. Polypropylene compositions having improved transparency 
and being substantially free from bleeding were reported in 
U.S. 4,314,039 based on the use of 1,3-2,4-di(alkylbenzylidene) 
sorbitol in which each alkyl group has (the same) 2 to 
18 carbon atoms; the position of the alkyl group was reported 
not to be critical. There are several commercial nucleators based on sorbitol 
which are useful in polyolefins including: 1,3-2,4-di-(benzylidene)-D-sorbitol 
(Millad 3905, Milliken Chemical Co.); 
1,3-2,4-di-(4-tolylidene)-D-sorbitol (Millad 3940, Milliken 
Chemical Co.); 1,3-2,4-di-(4-ethylbenzylidene)-D-sorbitol (NC-4,
