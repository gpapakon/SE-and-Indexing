<ABSTRACT>
The method serves to position a machine element (4, 5) relative to a datum point (1), preferably a stop or stop surface, the machine element (4, 5) being set with regard to the datum point (1) in such a way that an operative part (12) of the machine element (4, 5) is at a predetermined distance (h) from the datum point (1). In order to be able to move the machine element (4, 5) quickly and accurately into the required position in a simple manner, a value designating the predetermined distance (h) of the operative part (12) of the machine element (4, 5) from the datum point (1) is displayed on a first position display (9) of a display unit (8) when a distance (r) of the reference point (6) from the operative part (12) is set at a second position display (10).

A method of positioning a machine element (4), comprising a datum point (6), relative to 
a reference point (1), wherein the machine element (4) is set in such a way with respect 

to the reference point (1) that an effective part (12) of the machine element (4) is at a 
pre-determined distance (
h
) from the reference point (1), the distance (
h
) being displayed 
in a first position display (9) of a display appliance (8) which is provided with a second 

position display (10) for displaying a distance (
r
) of the datum point (6) of the machine 
element (4) from its effective part (12),
characterized in that,
 in order to set the distance (
r
), the first position display (9) is 
switched off and the second position display (10) is switched on, 


the machine element (4) is displaced relative to the reference point (1) until the said distance 
(
r
) is displayed in the second position display (10) of the display appliance (8), 
in order to set the pre-determined distance (
h
), the first position display (9) is switched 
on and the second position display (10) is switched off, and 
the machine element (4) is displaced so far relative to the reference point (1) until the 
pre-determined distance (
h
) is displayed in the first position display (9) of the display 
appliance (8). 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the axis of a spindle (5) is used as 
the datum point (6) of the machine element (4). 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the turning circle of the 
blades of the machining tool is used as the effective part (12) of the machine element (4). 
A method according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the turning circle is used as the 
distance (
r
) between the datum point (6) and the effective part (12) of the machine element 
(4). 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 during its adjustment 
the machine element (4) is optionally coupled to the position displays (9, 10). 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 a switch (11) is used 
to change between the two position displays (9, 10).  

 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the value displayed 
in the first position display (9) corresponds exactly to the finished workpiece dimension.
