<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making a viscosity index 
improving copolymer, which comprises heating a reaction mixture comprising from 

about 55 weight percent to about 99.5 weight percent of one or more first monomer 
selected from the group consisting of (C₈-C₁₅)alkyl (meth)acrylates and mixtures 

thereof, from about 0.5 weight percent to about 45 weight percent of one or more 
second monomer selected from the group consisting of (C₁-C₇)alkyl (meth)acrylates, 

(C₁₆-C₂₄)alkyl(meth)acrylates and mixtures thereof, a polymerization initiator and 
a hydrocarbon diluent, to a reaction temperature from about 75°C to about 100°C 

and maintaining the reaction mixture at the reaction temperature for a period of 
time effective to allow copolymerization of the monomers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a method for making certain 
poly(alkyl (meth)acrylates) useful as viscosity index improving additives for 
hydraulic fluids. Hydraulic systems, e.g., systems wherein the operation of high speed, high 
pressure hydraulic pumps is subject to wide temperature variations, can impose 
severe demands on hydraulic fluids. Additives for improving the properties, e.g., the viscosity index, of 
hydrocarbon base oils used in hydraulic fluids are known. Viscosity index 
improving additives reduce the influence of temperature changes on fluid viscosity. 
GB-A-1,172,697 discloses viscosity index improving copolymers of up to 50 weight 
% "readily polymerizable" monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, e.g., styrene, 
t-butyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate and mixtures thereof, with at least 50 
weight % "difficulty polymerizable" monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, e.g., 
lauryl methacrylate. US-A-5,112,509 discloses a method for making a poly(methyl 
methacrylate-co-lauryl methacrylate) copolymer for use in hydraulic fluids and 
lubricating oil compositions as a viscosity index improver. The process includes 
heating a reaction mixture of the monomers and a polymerisation initiator to a 
temperature from 93.3°C to 148.9°C (200°F to 300°F). Paraffinic oils have a tendency to gel at low temperatures due to ordering of 
wax molecules in the oil. In some hydraulic systems, e.g., mobile equipment, startup 
temperatures may be well below -17.8°C (0°F) and it is critically important that the 
hydraulic fluid in the system remains fluid at the low temperatures encountered. 
High performance hydraulic fluid compositions for applications involving low 
startup temperatures typically include a pour point depressing additive, in addition 
to a viscosity index improving additive, to improve the low temperature fluidity of 
the hydraulic fluid. Along with their several advantageous effects, known poly(alkyl 
(meth)acrylate) viscosity index improvers can impart at least one undesirable 
property to the hydraulic fluids in which they are used. Hydraulic fluids formulated 
with such additives have shown a tendency to form emulsions with ambient 
moisture during use. The performance of the emulsified fluids is compromised with 
respect to, e.g., lubricity, corrosion resistance, low temperature performance and 
compressibility. In addition, the presence of small amounts of water in hydraulic 
fluids has been found to detrimentally affect the filterability of such fluids. Reduced
