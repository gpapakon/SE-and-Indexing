<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a shutter hinge for window or door shutters, having a carrier leg and a connecting leg which can be adjusted relative to one another and can be clamped with respect to one another in predeterminable positions via at least one clamping member. In this arrangement, the guide between the carrier leg and the connecting leg is designed as a guide which has a pronounced degree of play, and centring surfaces which pass into positively and frictionally locking engagement under the action of a clamping member are provided between the carrier leg and the connecting leg.

Shutter hinge for shutters of windows or of doors, comprising a carrier
limb (1) having at one end a sleeve (2) for receiving a hinge pin

and a connection limb (3) forming a component of a shutter fastener
part (4) and coupled to the carrier limb (1) via a prismatic or C-shaped

guide, wherein the carrier limb (1) and the connection limb
(3) are adjustable relative to one another and can be mutually

clamped together in predeterminable positions via at least one
clamping member (5),

characterised in that

the guide between the carrier limb (1) and the connection limb (3) is
formed as a guide with pronounced clearance,
in that centering surfaces (9, 10), which enter into form-locked and
force-locked engagement under the action of the clamping member

(5), are provided between the carrier limb (1) and the connection
limb (3),
in that the carrier limb (1) has lateral cut-outs (12) into which inwardly
projecting projections (13) of the connection limb (3) engage

at least with clearance provided in the direction of action of the
clamping member (5),
and in that the centering surfaces (9, 10) are arranged separately
from the engagement zone between the cut-outs (12) and the projections

(13).
Shutter hinge in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2,

characterised in that

the centering surfaces (9, 10) are provided spaced apart with respect
to the lateral cut-outs (12) and the projections (13) which engage in

these at the margin in the base side engagement region between the
carrier limb (1) and the connection limb (3) and are in particular

formed as oblique surfaces.
Shutter hinge in accordance with claim 3,

characterised in that

the oblique centering surfaces (9, 10) extend at an angle of preferably
approximately 45Â° to the mutually parallel, oppositely disposed

base surfaces (16, 17) of the carrier limb (1) and the connection limb
(3).
Shutter hinge in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the clamping member (5) consists of a socket head screw, the
head part (18) of which acts on the carrier limb (1) through

which it passes, preferably via a toothed member (11) arranged
therebetween, and is in particular capable of being screwed

into the connection limb (3).
Shutter hinge in accordance with one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the shutter mounting part (4) consists of the connecting limb
(3) and of an angled limb (7) preferably connected with it at

right angles on which an abutment member (8), enabling an
adjustment, is mounted.
