<ABSTRACT>
A water-base dispersion composition which comprises a molten fluororesin powder with a mean particle diameter of 10 to 
1,000 µm, a water-soluble solvent, a surfactant and water and wherein the content of the molten fluororesin powder is 15-80 % by 

weight. The composition gives rise to neither crack nor pinhole and can provide a coating film with a thickness of 1 mm or above 
in one operation and further increase the overall film thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aqueous
dispersion composition of fluorine-containing melt-processable
resins, particularly relates to aqueous
dispersion compositions which can increase a thickness of
coating per one application and also can provide coatings
without crack. The compositions are especially useful as
aqueous dispersion paints.Fluorine-containing melt-processable resins such
as tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether are
excellent in chemical resistance, weatherability, heat
resistance, non-stickiness and the like, and further are
melt-processable. Therefore, the resins are used for
enhancing functions such as corrosion resistance,
non-stickiness and low abrasion by coating, for example,
heat resistance substrates such as iron, aluminium and
stainless steel.Conventionally, as for such a use, there are
paints of organic solvent type prepared by dissolving
fluorine-containing melt-processable resins in organic
solvents, and aqueous dispersion paints prepared by
dispersing fluorine-containing melt-processable resins in
water (JP-B-10896/1982).The aqueous dispersion compositions are safe
and easy to handle, and coatings thereof are formed by
applying onto a primer layer of a substrate with brushing
or air spraying, and then drying and sintering.Since resin particles in the conventional
aqueous dispersion paints are small in size, however, when
increasing a thickness of one application, cracks occur on
the resulting coating. Therefore, a coating obtainable by 
one application has a thickness of at most 50 µm. In
order to make the coating thicker even if the number of
applications increases, cracks also occur when the
thickness is large. Accordingly, a thickness of the
coating prepared by recoating method cannot be beyond 1
mm.Aqueous dispersion paints containing binders
disclosed in JP-A-10896/1982 cannot be used in recoating
method.An object of the present invention is to provide
aqueous dispersion compositions of fluorine-containing
melt-processable resins which can increase a thickness of
coating per one application and can give thicker coatings
having no crack.The present invention relates to aqueous
dispersion compositions comprising fluorine-containing
melt-processable resin powders having an average particle
size of 10 to 1000 µm and an apparent density of 0.3 to 1.5 g/cc, water-soluble solvents,
surfactants and water; said fluorine-containing melt-processable
resin powders being contained in an amount of
