<ABSTRACT>
A roof tile formed of a sheet metal, preferably steel, in which the sheet material tile is strengthened by integral flanges (11), raised bosses (14) and depressions (15). The raised bosses (14) in use act as supports between one tile and an overlapping portion of another tile.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A Fabricated Roof TileThis invention relates to roof tiles and in particular to roof tiles formed from thin sheet material.A problem associated with ceramic and slate roof tiles is their inherent lack of flexural strength and brittleness, particularly in the case of roofing slate, so that rooves made from slates or tiles can be easily damaged by per¬ sons walking over the roof.A further problem associated with large slates and roof tiles in that due to their weight should they come loose from the roof and fall to the ground, they are extremely dangerous and could cause injury or death if a falling tile should strike a person or animal.In the past fabricated roof tiles have been formed from heavily filled plastic materials, such as P.V.C., col¬ oured to appear like slates. However, these tiles are again brittle and will easily snap into pieces if subject to flexural loads foe example by persons walking on them during maintenance. Flat thin sheet metal roof tiles could be used but such tiles whilst not being brittle will tend to bend and distort when walked upon.The present invention provides a roof tile which over¬ comes the above problems. 

Accordingly there is provided a sheet metal roof tile which in. use co-operates with other such roof tiles for laying in rows upon a roof such that tiles in one row overlap the upper portions of tiles in a lower row, and are themselves overlapped by the pans of tiles in an up¬ per row, characterised in that the sheet metal tile is formed with at least one offset strengthening portion raised out of the plane of the tile and which in use acts as support to a pan of an overlapping portion of an¬ other tile.The invention also comprises a roof covering comprising a plurality of roof tiles of the above type arranged side-by-side in a single row , the tiles being formed as a single sheet metal pressing and being connected at their lateral edges.The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawing in which:Fig.- 1 is a plan view of a tile according to the invention as showing an overlapping tile in dotted outline, Fig. 2 is a section on the line II-II of Fig 1, Fig. 3 is a section on the line III-III of Fig 1, Fig. 4 is a sketch showing the overlapping arrangement between two rows of tile, and Fig. 5 is a roof covering comprising two side-by-side tiles in a single sheet metal pressing. 

With reference to Figs 1 to 3 there is illustrated a roof tile formed from a sheet metal pressing, preferably from sheet steel having a

Clai s
1. A sheet metal roof which in use co-operates with other such roof tiles for laying in rows upon a roof such that the tiles in one row overlap the upper portions of tiles in a lower row, and are themselves overlapped by the pans of tiles in an upper row, characterised in that the sheet metal tile is formed with at least one off set strengthening portion raised out of -the plane of the tile and which in use acts as support to the pan of an over¬ lapping portion of another tile.
2. A roof tile as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the upper portion of the roof tile has two offset portions symmetrically spaced laterally apart.
3. A roof tile as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein each offset portion has a depression therein, the base of the depressions in use abutting a support for se¬ curing the tile thereto.
4. A roof tile as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 3 , wherein the upper edge of the tile has a flange thereon which in use rests against a support.
5. A roof tile as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the tile has a turned down flange around its outer peripheral edge. 


6. A roof tile as claimed in Claim 5 when dependant upon Claim 2 wherein the offset portions extend laterally inwardly from the side edges of the tile for about 30% of the width of the tile, and from the top edge downwardly for about 40% of the length of the tile.
7. A roof tile as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6, wherein the offset portion is out of the plane of the up¬ per surface of the tile by a height which is only slightly greater than the depth of the edge flange around the lower portion of the slate.
8. A roof tile as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7 wherein the upper surface of the lower section of the tile is decorated with a surface effect to resemble a slate or other traditional materials.
9. A roof covering comprising a plurality of roof tiles as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 , arranged side-by-side in a single row , the tiles being formed a single sheet metal pressing and being joined at their lateral edges.
