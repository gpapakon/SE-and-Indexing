<ABSTRACT>
The printing unit has two interacting nip-forming cylinders (1, 4) which exhibit printing saddles (2, 5) separated by cylinder grooves (3, 6). The paper web (7) passing the nip is transported in pilgrim-step operation in order to print adjoining formats. The two cylinders (1, 4) can be adjusted at an angle, with respect to the position of their printing saddles (2, 5) interacting in the nip, offset with respect to one another by a circumferential distance which is approximately equal to the difference between the circumferential length (S) of a printing saddle and the circumferential length (B) of a printed image. Consequently, the printed zone is only approximately as large as the printed image, and the printing-free zone available for drawing back the paper web is correspondingly enlarged.

Printing unit for a web-fed printing machine with two
co-operating cylinders (1,4) which form the printing

nip and which have a plurality of printing saddles
(2,5) separated by non-printing grooves, for printing a

web (7) running through the printing nip with variable
formats adjoining one another, the web being

transported at variable speed in a so-called pilgrim-step
mode, and after each printing operation, when it

passes a groove, being retracted and accelerated again
relative to the circumference of the two cylinders

(1,4) in such a way that successive printing images are
lined up virtually without a gap wherein the two

cylinders (1,4) are set angularly relative to one
another, in respect of the position of their printing

saddle (2,5) co-operating in the printing nip,
depending on the format, in a manner offset by the

amount of a circumferential distance which is at least
approximately equal to the difference between the

circumferential length (S) of a printing saddle (2,5)
and the circumferential length (B) of a printing image,

so that the length (D) of the impression zone, along
which two printing saddles clamp the web (7) between

them when they pass the printing nip, is only
approximately as large as the circumferential length

(B) of a printing image, characterised in that the
cylinders (1,4) comprise cylinder pits (3,6), as on

cylinders of a sheet printing machine, forming said
grooves, that a first release member (K) is fastened on

the circumference of the cylinder (1), on which the 
beginning of a printing saddle, with respect to the

direction of rotation of the cylinder, corresponds to
the beginning (A) of the printing image, and a first

sensor (I) activable by this release member is
installed in proximity to the circumference of this

cylinder, in that a second release member (L) is
fastened on the circumference of the other cylinder

(4), on which the end of a printing saddle corresponds
to the end (E) of the printing image, and a second

sensor (M) activable by this release member is
installed in proximity to the circumference of this

cylinder, and in that said release members and said
sensors are so arranged and designed that the first

sensor (I) generates a first signal at the moment at
which the beginning of a printing saddle (2) passes the

connecting line between the axes of the two cylinders
(1,4) and the second sensor (M) generates a signal at

the moment at which the end of the printing saddle (5)
co-operating with said printing saddle passes said

connecting line, said signals and the time span between
the two signals representing measured values for the

angular position and the circumferential length of the
printing zone and are used for controlling the movement

of the paper web (7) in the pilgrim-step mode during
the passage of an impression-free zone.
