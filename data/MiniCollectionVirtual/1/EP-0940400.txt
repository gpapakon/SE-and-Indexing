A heterocyclic amide compound of the formula (I)


wherein each symbol is as delined in the specification, a pharmacologically
acceptable salt thereof, a pharmaceutical composition thereof and a

pharmaceutical use thereof. The heterocyclic amide compound and a
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof of the present invention have superior

inhibitory action on chymase group in mammals inclusive of human, and can be
administered orally or parenterally. Therefore, they are useful as chymase

inhibitors and can be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of various diseases
caused by chymase, such as those caused by angiotensin II.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel heterocyclic amide compound, a
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, a pharmaceutical composition thereof,
and a pharmaceutical use thereof More particularly, the present invention
relates to pyridoneacetamide and pyrimidoneacetamide derivatives useful
pharmacologically, diagnostically and for the prophylaxis and treatment of
diseases, and a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof. Moreover, the present
invention relates to a intermediate necessary for the synthesis of the above-mentioned
heterocyclic amide compound.Angiotensin II shows physiological activities such as vasopression by
strong contraction of blood vessel, stimulation of aldosterone secretion from
adrenal cortex (aldosterone retains sodium), and the like, and is considered to be a
causative substance or risk factor of diseases such as hypertension, hypercardia,
myocardial infarction, arteriosclerosis, diabetic and non-diabetic renal diseases,
vascular restenosis after PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty)
and the like.It is known that this angiotensin II is generated by cleavage of two amino
acid residues from angiotensin I, which is a peptide consisting of ten amino acids
present in a living body, and that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is involved
in said cleavage. Thus, numerous ACE inhibitors have been developed for the
prophylaxis and treatment of the above-mentioned diseases.Meanwhile, actions of a chymase group including human heart chymase,
human mast cell chymase and human cutis chymase, which is one of the
subfamilies of serine protease, have been drawing attention in recent years.It has been clarified that chymase is involved in the course of generation,
which is independent from ACE, of angiotensin II in the conversion of the above-mentioned
angiotensin I to angiotensin II (Okunishi et al., Jpn. J. Pharmacol.
1993, 62, p. 207 etc. and others). Also, chymase is known to use, as substrates,
numerous physiologically active substances such as extracellular matrix, cytokine,
substance P, VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide), apoprotein B and the like, and
known to be responsible for the activation of other proteases such as collagenase 
(Igakuno ayumi, Miyazaki et al., 1995, 172, p. 559).Therefore, chymase inhibitors are expected to become inhibitors of
angiotensin II action, as well as agents for the prophylaxis and treatment of
various diseases caused by chymase, since it inhibits generation of ACE non-dependent
angiotensin II. A patent application drawn to a
