<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an odour seal (1) for a drainage device, comprising a housing (2) with a connection stub (8) for a supply pipe (9), and an immersion pipe (7) which extends into the housing chamber (5), which is partially filled with water (6), to beneath the water surface and, with the housing (2), delimits an annular space from which a connection stub (10) for a discharge pipe (11) extends. According to the invention, the lower end of the immersion pipe (7) is designed as a seat for a ball (12) which is arranged in the interior of the immersion pipe (7) and can float in the water (6).
