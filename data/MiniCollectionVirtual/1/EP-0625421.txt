<ABSTRACT>
A machine for scraping tyre treads comprising two units (10, 30), one 
(10) upper and one (30) lower, arranged according to a vertical axis 

(y-y) for the handling and positioning of a tyre (2) in a symmetrical 
position relative to a horizontal axis (z-z) and for operating the said 

tyre in rotation around an axis of rotation coinciding with the 
vertical axis of such handling and operating units (10, 30), there 

being furthermore provided a unit (20) for work tools (21) placed in 
rotation around a vertical axis parallel to the axis of rotation of 

tyre (2) and automatic means (5, 5a) for loading/unloading tyre (2)

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a machine for scraping tyre treads with 
a vertical axis of rotation. It is known that in the technology of the so-called retreading of tyres 
- that is, the replacement of the old, worn tread with a new tread - it 
is necessary to perform a preliminary operation to remove the old tread 
before applying the new one. There are also known machines capable of performing this operation, 
commonly known as "scraping", in which provision is made for applying 
the tyre to be processed to a support consisting of two plates 
maintained at a spacing which corresponds to the original dimensions of 
inside diameter and thickness of the tyre to be processed. In such type of known machine the tyre to be processed is positioned on 
a vertical support having a horizontal axis of rotation; it is 
therefore obvious that it is necessary to perform difficult and 
dangerous operations to hold and position the tyre once it has been 
made integral with the support and put under pressure. With such type 
of machine it is moreover extremely difficult to automate the 
operations of loading and unloading of the tyre on/from the mandrel and 
to enable the tyre supporting plates to adapt to any dimension of the 
inside diameter of the tyre so as to make the mandrel and tyre integral 
with one another in a sealed manner for the inflation of the latter. There is therefore posed the technical problem of providing a tyre 
processing machine which will make it possible to perform all the 
operations comprising loading and unloading of the tyre in an automatic 
manner and equipped with means of variable diameter for the handling  
 
and rotation of the tyre in order to adapt the machine to any size of 
tyre without the need to change the said mandrel, thereby also making 
it possible to avoid having to press tyres of different dimensions onto 
specific tyre bead discs suitable only for a particular diameter of 
tyre. Within the context of such problem there is a further need to provide 
a compact machine capable of being enclosed within a soundproof cabinet 
for great safety of work and extraction of processing fumes and dust. Such results are obtained with the present invention, which provides a 
machine for scraping tyre treads comprising two units, one upper and 
one lower, arranged according to a vertical axis (y-y) for the handling 
and positioning of a tyre in a symmetrical position relative to a 
horizontal axis (z-z) and for operating the said tyre in rotation 
around an axis of rotation coinciding
