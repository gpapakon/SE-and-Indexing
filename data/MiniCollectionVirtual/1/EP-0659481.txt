<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention - The invention relates to 
advanced adsorbents useful in pressure swing adsorption 
processes. More particularly, it relates to the 
recovery of lithium used for the production of the 
lithium exchanged forms of such advanced adsorbents.
Description of the Prior Art - In chemical processing, 
refinery, metal production and other industrial 
applications, purified gas streams are employed for a 
variety of processing purposes. For example, high 
purity oxygen is used in chemical processing, steel 
mills, paper mills, and in lead and gas production 
operations. Oxygen and nitrogen are produced from air, 
typically by cryogenic distillation. While such 
cryogenic processing can be very efficient, 
particularly when conducted in large size plants, it 
nevertheless requires complex and costly equipment. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes have 
also been used to separate and purify gases, as for the 
production of oxygen generally in relatively smaller-sized 
operations where the use of cryogenic air 
separation may not be economically feasible. Many 
commonly available adsorbents, particularly the class 
of materials known as molecular sieves, selectively 
adsorb nitrogen more strongly then oxygen, and this 
preferential adsorption is the basis of a variety of 
PSA processes that have been developed for the 
separation of air to produce oxygen and nitrogen 
product gas. The Chao patent U.S. 4,859,217, discloses the 
lithium cation forms of zeolite X, particularly the 
forms in which the framework Si/Al molar ratio is from 
about 2.0 to about 3.0, preferably from 2.0 to 2.5, 
wherein at least about 88%, preferably at least 90%,  
 
and more preferably at least 95%, of the AlO₂⁻ 
tetrahedral units are associated with lithium cations. 
In the Chao et al. patent, U.S. 5,174,979, 
lithium/alkaline earth metal zeolites of the X and A 
type are disclosed, with lithium to earth metal ratios 
of 95:5 to 50:50, and 10:90 to 70:30, respectively. 
Such mixed cation materials are also well suited to 
PSA-air separation operations and have high thermal 
stability characteristics. Li+ zeolites are commonly prepared from the 
corresponding Na+ zeolites by ion exchange. A 
concentrated aqueous solution of Li+Cl- is passed 
through a column containing the Na+ zeolite. The Na+ 
ions are displaced by the Li+ ions to produce the 
desired Li+ zeolite. Since zeolites generally have a 
greater affinity for the Na+ ion than for the Li+ ion, 
a considerable quantity of strong Li+Cl- solution is 
required
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for the capture and concentration 
of Li+ ions from dilute solutions thereof in an ion-exchange 

system containing one or more beds of ion-exchange 
material capable of ion exchange between Li+ 

ions and Na+ ions, each bed undergoing a cyclic charge-regeneration 
cycle comprising: 


(a) passing a dilute Li+ solution to a first 
end of said bed loaded largely with Na+ ions in 

equilibrium with a concentrated solution of Na+Cl-, 
said Li+ displacing some of the Na+ ions so that: 


(1) a concentrated Na+ rich solution is 
initially discharged from a second end of said 

bed; and 
(2) a dilute Na+ solution is thereafter 
discharged from the second end of the bed as 

process waste, the passing of a dilute Li+ 
solution to the first end of the bed being 

terminated when the Li+ concentration in the 
solution discharged from the bed increases 

significantly; 
(b) passing a concentrated solution of 
Na+Cl- to the second end of the bed, said Na+ 

displacing some of the Li ions so that: 

(1) a dilute Li+ solution is initially 
discharged from the first end of said bed; and 
(2) a Li+ solution of appreciably 
increased concentration is thereafter discharged 

from the first end of said bed, the thus-concentrated 
lithium solution comprising the 

desired lithium recovery product, whereby lithium 
present in a dilute solution is effectively 

captured and concentrated for recycle to a zeolite 
lithium exchange plant or passage to a 

recrystallization plant for further purification. 
The process of Claim 1 in which the ion-exchange 
system contains one bed of ion-exchange 

material. 
The process of Claim 1 in which the ion-exchange 
system contains two beds of ion-exchange 

material. 
The process of Claim 3 in which (1) the 
concentrated Na+ rich solution discharged from the 

second end of the first bed in step (a) (1) is recycled 
to the second end of the second bed in the system for 

use in step (b) therein, and (2) the dilute Li+ 
solution initially dis
charged from the first end of the 
first bed in step (b) (1) is recycled to the first end 

of the second bed for use in step (a) therein. 
The process of Claim 2 in which the dilute 
Li+ solution discharged in step (b) (1) and the 

concentrated Na+ rich solution discharged in step 
(a) (1) are passed to storage for reuse. 
The process of Claim 2 in which the dilute 
Li+ solution discharged in step (b) (1) is recovered as 

part of the desired lithium recovery product. 
The process of Claim 2 in which the 
concentrated Na+ rich solution discharged in step 

(a) (1) is discharged to waste with the waste stream of 
step (a) (2). 
The process of Claim 1 in which the 
concentrated lithium solution comprising desired 

lithium recovery product is passed to a lithium 
exchange unit for the production of lithium exchanged 

adsorbents. 
The process of Claim 1 in which the 
concentrated lithium solution comprising desired 

lithium recovery product is passed to an evaporative 
concentration and fractional crystallization unit for 

further purification prior to use in lithium exchanged 
adsorbent product operations.
