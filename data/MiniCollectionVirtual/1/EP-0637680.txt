<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid-cooled multi-cylinder V-shaped internal combustion engine each cylinder (4-9) is enclosed by a separate coolant chamber (10-15) and a feed passage (22) and two return passages (29, 30) are provided on the insides of the cylinder banks (2, 3) for coolant ducting. In order to even out the cooling of the individual cylinders (4-9), a single feed passage (22) is arranged between the two cylinder banks (2, 3), which passage is directly connected to each individual coolant chamber (10-15).

<CLAIMS>
Liquid-cooled, multi-cylinder internal combustion engine 
having a first and a second row of cylinders, in particular 

in a V-shaped configuration, in which each cylinder is 
surrounded by a separate coolant liquid chamber and in 

which an intake passage is provided for feeding coolant 
liquid to the individual coolant liquid chambers as well as 

two return flow passages on the inner sides of the rows of 
cylinders for draining the coolant liquid from the 

individual coolant liquid chambers,
characterised in that
 
only a single intake passage (22) is provided, which is 

arranged in the intermediate space between the two rows of 
cylinders (2, 3), and each coolant liquid chamber (10 to 

15) is connected to the intake passage (22) independently 
of any other coolant liquid chamber (10 to 15). 
Internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the intake passage (22) is arranged deeper than the two 

return flow passages (29, 30). 
Internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 
the two return flow passages (29, 30) are connected to one 

another on an end face of the internal combustion engine 
(1) by means of an externally mounted transverse passage 

(31), the coolant liquid flows in the same direction in the 
two return flow passages (29, 30) to the transverse passage 

(31) and a port (32) is arranged thereon to discharge the 
coolant liquid out of the housing of the internal 

combustion engine. 
Internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 
the two return flow passages (29, 30) are connected to one 

another on an end face of the internal combustion engine 
(1) by means of an externally mounted transverse passage 

(31), the coolant liquid flows in the one return flow 
passage (29) to the transverse passage (31) and in the 

other return passage (30) away from the transverse passage 
(31) to a port (34) arranged on the end thereof facing away 

from the transverse passage (31) to direct the coolant 
liquid to a component to be cooled. 
Internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that
 
the transverse passage (31) extends within an end cover 

(20) closing off an end face of the internal combustion 
engine (1) which covers at its inflow side the intake 

passage (22) lying underneath the transverse passage (31). 
Internal combustion engine as claimed in one of claims 
1 to 5,
characterised in that
 
a connecting passage (23 to 28) betwee
n the intake passage 
(22) and a liquid coolant chamber (10 to 15) opens therein 

by means of an orifice (36) lying in the lower and middle 
region thereof, the coolant liquid chamber (10 to 15) is 

divided by means of a dividing ring (37) arranged in the 
upper region of the orifice (36) into an upper annular 

chamber (3) which is connected to a cooling chamber in the 
associated cylinder head (42) to which coolant liquid can 

flow, and a lower annular chamber (39) which, as far as the 
coolant liquid is concerned, is at least predominantly 

separate from the upper annular chamber (38). 
Internal combustion chamber as claimed in claim 6,
characterised in that
  
 

the connecting passages (23 to 28) are angled. 
Internal combustion engine as claimed in claim 6 or 7,
characterised in that
 
a cut-out portion (40) is provided in the dividing ring 

(37) on the side remote from the orifice (36). 
Internal combustion engine as claimed in one of claims 
6 to 8,
characterised in that
 
an additional orifice (41 or 46) opening directly into the 

return flow passage (30) and/or into the cylinder head (42) 
is provided in the upper region of the upper annular 

chamber (38) remote from the orifice (45) opening into the 
cooling chamber of the cylinder head (42).
