<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet printing 
cloth and a textile printing process. In particular, this 
invention relates to an ink-jet printing cloth which is 
composed mainly of cellulose fibers and can be dyed for 
obtaining highly colored, bright and fine patterns with 
high color yield upon formation of a printed image by an 
ink-jet system, a textile printing process using such a 
cloth, and prints provided by this process. At present, textile printing is principally 
conducted by screen printing or roller printing. Both 
methods requires to make a plate, and are hence unfit for 
multi-kind small-quantity production and difficult to 
quickly cope with the fashion of the day. Therefore, 
there has recently been a demand for development of an 
electronic printing system making no use of any plate. In 
compliance with this demand, many textile printing 
processes according to ink-jet recording have been 
proposed. Various fields expect much from such textile 
printing processes. Ink-jet printing cloths used in such a system are  
 
required to have the following performance 
characteristics: 
(1) being colored with an ink to a sufficient color 
depth; (2) being dyed high in color yield with an ink; (3) causing an ink on the cloth to quickly dry; (4) causing little irregular bleeding of inks on the 
cloth; (5) being excellent in feedability in apparatus; and (6) stably providing a print. In order to satisfy these performance requirements, 
the surface of a cloth has heretofore been subjected to a 
pretreatment in advance, thereby coping with these 
requirements. Cloths having an ink-receiving layer have been 
disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-Open JP-A-62-53492 (EP-A-212 655), and cloths containing an 
antireducing agent and an alkaline substance therein have 
been proposed in Japanese Patent Publication JP-B-3-46589. According to such pretreatments, considerable 
effects are partially recognized on the above 
requirements. However, whether a printed image after a 
final process is superior or inferior often still depends 
on the basic properties inherent in a cloth to be used. 
There is thus a problem that satisfactory cloths can not 
yet be obtained. As described above, means capable of  
 
satisfying the above individual performance 
characteristics to some extent have been able to be found 
in the prior art. However, there have not yet been known 
under the circumstances any ink-jet printing cloth and 
textile printing process which can satisfy all the

fibers, wherein the specific gravity of the cloth in an 

absolute dry condition is adjusted within a range of from 
1.45 to 1.49 by mercerization. 
The ink-jet printing cloth according to Claim 1, 
wherein the cloth is a 100 % cotton cloth. 
The ink-jet printing cloth according to Claim 1, 
wherein the cloth comprises the cellulose fibers having an 

average length of 25 to 60 mm and an average thickness of 
0,667 to 2,44 dtex (0.6 to 2.2 deniers), and has a water content of 13.5 to 

108.5 %. 
The ink-jet printing cloth according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the cloth has been 

further treated with at least an alkaline substance and carries the 
alkaline substance in an amount of 0.01 to 5 % by weight 

based on the weight of the cloth in an absolute dry 
condition.  

 
The ink-jet printing cloth according to any one 
of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the cloth has been further treated with and contains at least one 

substance selected from the group consisting of water-soluble 
metal salts, water-soluble polymers, urea and 

thiourea in an amount of 0.01 to 20 % by weight based on 
the weight of the cloth in an absolute dry condition. 
A textile printing process comprising applying a 
printing ink to a cloth by an ink-jet system, subjecting 

the cloth to a dyeing treatment and then washing the cloth 
thus treated, characterised in that said cloth is an ink-jet printing 

cloth according to any one of Claims 1 to 5. 
The textile printing process according to Claim 
6, wherein the ink-jet system is an ink-jet system making 

use of thermal energy.
