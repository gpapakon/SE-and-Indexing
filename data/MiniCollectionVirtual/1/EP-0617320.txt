<ABSTRACT>
A radiation sensitive emulsion stabilized 
against changes in sensitivity and fog upon aging is 

disclosed. The radiation sensitive emulsion contains a 
silver halide grain population comprising at least 50 mole 

percent chloride, based on silver, wherein at least 50 
percent of the grain population projected area is 

accounted for by tabular grains (a) bounded by {100} major 
faces having adjacent edge ratios of less than 10, and (b) 

each having an aspect ratio of at least 2. The emulsion 
contains a stabilizer which i
s (A) a mercapto heterocyclic 
nitrogen compound containing a mercapto group bonded to a 

carbon atom which is linked to an adjacent nitrogen atom 
in a heterocyclic ring system, (B) a quaternary aromatic 

chalcogenazolium salt wherein the chalcogen is sulfur, 
selenium or tellurium, (C) a triazole or tetrazole 

containing an ionizable hydrogen bonded to a nitrogen atom 
in a heterocyclic ring system, (D) a dichalcogenide 

compound comprising an -X-X- linkage between carbon atoms 
wherein each X is divalent sulfur, selenium or tellurium, 

(E) an organic compound containing a thiosulfonyl group 
having the formula -SO₂SM where M is a proton or cation, 

(F) a mercuric salt, or (G) a quinone compound. Photographic 
elements, particularly color photographic elements 

containing this emulsion are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radiation sensitive 
tabular grain silver halide emulsion with enhanced sensitivity 
and improved storage properties. Silver halide emulsions having high chloride 
contents, e.g., greater than 50 mole percent chloride 
based on silver, are known to be very desirable in 
image-forming systems due to the high solubility of silver 
chloride, which permits short processing times and 
provides less environmentally polluting effluents. Unfortunately, 
the higher the chloride content of a silver 
halide emulsion, the more difficult it is to achieve high 
and stable radiation sensitivity (sometimes referred to in 
the photographic art as "speed"). One reason for this is 
that conventional emulsions having high chloride contents 
exhibit a severe propensity to deterioration upon aging or 
storage. As a consequence, such an aged or stored emulsion 
when processed, produces a higher minimum density 
than the "fresh" emulsion. This increase in minimum 
density, commonly referred to as "fog", is attributable to 
the formation of a low level of reduced silver formation 
that occurs independently of imagewise exposure. In color 
photography, fog is typically observed as image dye 
density, rather than directly as silver density. Changes 
in fog and
 
sensitivity are particularly troublesome in color photographic 
elements that comprise multiple color layers since 
such changes can vary from layer to layer which results in 
a color imbalance and reduction in quality. Materials known in the photographic art as 
photographic "stabilizers", as distinguished from the 
general class of "antifoggants", have been used in the 
past to protect radiation sensitive silver halide emulsions  
 
against changes in sensitivity and fog upon aging 
and storage. One skilled in the art readily recognizes 
the distinction between the use of photographic stabilizers, 
which combat fog and sensitivity changes that occur 
upon storage, and those materials, categorized as antifoggants, 
which combat fog caused by such things as the 
inherent nature of the radiation sensitive silver halide 
emulsion (which may produce chemical fog) or the conditions 
of development of the emulsion, for example, development 
for protracted periods of time or at temperatures 
above normal. A more detailed discussion of this distinction 
between antifoggants and stabilizers can be found in

Disclosure, August 1976, Item 14851
