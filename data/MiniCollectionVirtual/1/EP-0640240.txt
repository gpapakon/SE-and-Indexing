<ABSTRACT>
A stock material for winding into a magnet coil includes a running length of conductive aluminum metal (70) having a cross section that has first and second long sides and two short sides. The long sides and short sides meet at corners which are substantially free of jagged edges and sharp corners. An insulating epoxy polymer coating (72) uniformly about 0.001 inch (25 microns) thick covers the first long side and the short sides, with the second long side being substantially free of the insulating coating. A heat-activatable adhesive (68) is arrayed non-continuously on one of the long sides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making magnet
coils and the coils made thereby. The coils may be used in transformers or other
electrical gear. For the sake of simplicity, the invention will be described herein
with reference to winding transformers, but it is to be understood that the
invention has a scope wide enough to contemplate coils having various uses.Transformer winding has been carried out for a great many years. In a
transformer, typically two coils are formed and configured so that, when an
alternating electric current is conducted through one, a magnetic field is set up
which passes through the other, thereby inducing a current in the other coil.
Depending upon the numbers of windings involved, the transformer may step up
or step down the voltage of the primary coil to the voltage of the secondary coil.
Transformers are widely used in electrical power distribution systems to increase
their efficiency. As such, they handle high voltages and/or high currents. In
order to handle the high currents involved, it has been found that providing the
conductor to be wound into the coil in a sheet form is quite advantageous.The conventional process for winding conductor sheets into a transformer
is disclosed in a publication entitled "Concentration", Vol. 1, 1970 by Delbert W.
Shobe of RTE Corp., 1900 E. North St., Waukesha, Wisconsin. The transformers
are wound from elongated sheets of bare aluminum (or in some cases copper)
with interleaved layers of an insulating paper. The paper provides electrical
insulation between layers (called "turns") of the wound conductor. An adhesive
epoxy is applied to the paper in a diamond pattern before it is wound into the
transformer. The completely wound transformer is heated to a high temperature
to volatilize any liquids and, at the same time, the epoxy adhesive on the paper
binds the conductor turns and paper turns together into a solid unit. After the
conductor cools, it is loaded into a casing which is then filled with an insulating
transformer oil, which penetrates the paper and the interstices between the
diamond pattern of the epoxy adhesive. Connections to the two ends of the coil 
are typically made at the appropriate time in the processing by cold welding input
and output terminations.This general technique has been used for 20 or more years with adequate
success. However, the volumes taken up by the transformer, including the paper,
oil and adhesive, can become excessive, particularly when a great many turns are
required in the fabrication

A method of making a magnet coil (50) comprising the steps of :

a) providing a running length (15) of conductive metal (70, 76) having first
and second long sides and two short edges, the said sides and edges meeting

at corners ;
b) rounding on said running length said corners ;
c) applying an insulating polymer coating (60, 72, 74) on the first long side,
said rounded corners and the two edges ;
d) applying on one of the first and second sides a heat-activatable
adhesive (62, 64, 68, 78) ;
e) winding the coated conductive metal about an axis parallel with the long
sides so that the running length is built up into single layers (52, 54, 56, 58) of a

coil, with each layer separated by the coating on the first long side ; and
f) heating the wound coil to a temperature to activate the adhesive to block
the coil ;

characterized in that, in step c), the coating is applied so as to leave the second
long side substantially free of the insulating coating.
A method as claimed in claim 1 and in which the adhesive (62, 64,
68, 78) does not continuously cover the long side to which it is applied, further

comprising immersing the coil in oil to permit the oil to penetrate to interstitial
voids in the adhesive between layers.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the adhesive (62, 64, 68,
78) is a B-stage epoxy and the heating step includes heating the wound coil to

cross-link the epoxy.
A method as claimed in claim 1 further including cold welding a
termination strip to said second side.
A method according to Claim 1 wherein said step of providing a
running length (15) of conductive metal comprises slitting a wide width of sheet

material formed of conductive metal, and wherein said slitting and rounding
steps are performed continuously on said running length of metal. 
A magnet coil (50) comprising a single-layered elongated conductive
metal (70, 76) having a cross section having first and second long sides and

two short edges and wound into a coil (50) about an axis parallel to said long
sides so that said first and second long sides face one another, said sides and

edges meeting at rounded corners, and a polymeric insulating coating (60, 72,
74) adhered directly to said metal on said first long side, said edges and said

rounded corners, and a single adhesive layer (62, 64, 68, 78) interposed
between said second long side and said insulating coating on said first long

side, characterized in that said second long side is substantially free of
insulating coating.

greater than 30 times longer than said short edges.
A magnet coil as claimed in claim 6 wherein said adhesive (62, 64,
68, 78) layer is non-continuously arrayed on said second edges.

than in said middle.
