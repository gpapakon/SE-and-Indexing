 EPIBATIDINE AND DERIVATIVES, COMPOSITIONS AND' METHODS OF TREATING PAINFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to epibatidine and its derivatives, compositions and methods of treating pain.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The control of pain is at present primarily through the use of opioid-like analgetics, such as morphine, fentanyl, pentazocine, etc., or through non-steroidal antiinflammatories. There are limitations to the usefulness of such agents, and other classes of analgetics for the control and amelioration of pain are needed. A trace alkaloid epibatidine from skins of a neotropical frog is two-hundred fold more potent than morphine administered subcutaneously to mice in a standard analgetic test. In addition the analgesia elicited by epibatidine is not antagonized by the opioid antagonist naloxone, indicating that the analgesia is not due to actions of epibatidine at opioid receptors. In support of this conclusion is the very low affinity of epibatidine for dihydromorphine binding sites in rodent brain membranes. Epibatidine at higher doses causes a marked Straub-tail response, as does morphine, an effect linked to activation of dopamine pathways in the spinal cord. However, the Straub-tail response to epibatidine, unlike the Straub tail response to morphine, is not blocked by the opioid-antagonist naloxone.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a purified and isolated compound having the formula:
 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt therof. 

 The present invention is also directed to a compound having the formula:
 wherein R1 is selected from H, lower alkyl, C3-C9 cycloalkyl, acyl, and C3-C9 cycloalkylalkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, hydroxyalkyl, or C3-C8 cycloalkenyl or C3- C8 cycloalkynyl; and wherein R is selected from cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryls (selected from the group consisting of pyridyl, thienyl, furanyl, i idazolyl, pyrazinyl, and pyrimidyl) or phenoxy and wherein said R groups can be substituted with hydroxyl, "C--C6 lower alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, CJ-CG lower alkoxyl, halo, Ci-Ce haloalkyl, a ino, Cj-CÎ² alkylamino and C2-C10 dialkylamino, and sulfonamido or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with the proviso that R is not 6-chloro-3-pyridyl and R1 is not H.The present invention is also directed to analgetic compositions which comprise an effective amount of the above compounds, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a method for treating analgesia which comprises administering to a host in need thereof a analgetic effective
