<ABSTRACT>
A positive displacement flowmeter comprising a 
flowmeter portion including a pair of rotors rotatable in 

proportion to a fluid's flow in a measuring chamber and a 
counting portion for measuring a total flow by counting the 

rotor's rotations. It has many improvements. Firstly, the 
flowmeter is protected against the penetration of rain water 

into its counting portion. Furthermore, the counting 
portion housing is so constructed as to assure the easy 

mounting of an electric circuit and like components therein 
and also the possibility to control said circuit from the 

outside of the housing by use of reed switches and the like. 
The flowmeter is improved not to transfer heat of a fluid of 

high temperature to the counting portion and, furthermore, 
to assure the easy mounting of rotors in the measuring 

chamber. Particularly, it is possible to provide high 
performance rotors mounted in the measuring chamber by using 

non-circular gears having a special tooth profile and made 
of special materials. Other various improvements are 

presented.

<DESCRIPTION>
Conventional type flowmeters, each of which has an 
indicator unitarily attached to its body and is connected to 
a pipe by means of flanges or like joining means, are 
generally used for measuring and indicating the fluid's flow 
by processing a flow-rate signal from a measuring portion. 
There have been many applications of positive displacement 
flowmeters of this type. The positive displacement 
flowmeter, operating on the principle of a constant volume 
of fluid discharged by a rotor rotating in a measuring 
chamber of the flowmeter's body, is usually mounted with its 
rotor shaft horizontally positioned so as to correctly 
measure the fluid's flow-rate proportional to the rotation 
of the rotor without causing any undesirable rolling 
friction. Furthermore, when the flowmeter is mounted on the 
piping, its indicating portion is attached to the 
flowmeter's body horizontally along the axis of the 
flowmeter so as to vertically dispose the indicating panel 
for easily reading it. The positive displacement flowmeter's body is attached 
at its flanges to a pipeline through which a fluid to be 
measured flows. A counting portion having the function of 
processing the flow-rate's signal and to indicate the value 
obtained is accommodated in an outer housing which is 
removably attached to the flowmeter's body through an outer  
 
connecting housing with setscrews in deeply counter-bored 
holes in the outer housing. However, in the case where the 
flowmeter is mounted on outdoor piping, rain water may 
accumulate in the deeply counter-bored holes and penetrate 
through the threaded portions of the set-screws into a small 
clearance between the inserted pipe of the outer indicator 
housing and the inserted hole of the outer housing, which 
during a long period of time may exert an adverse effect on 
the inner devices of the counting portion and also make it 
impossible to remove the inserted part of the outer 
indicator housing from the connecting housing due to the 
rusting of its inserted part. The outer indicator housing, accommodating therein the 
circuit components such as a preamplifier for amplifying the 
flow-rate signal, is composed of a body portion having a 
closed bottom for placing the circuit components thereon and 
a sealing cover threadably attached to the body to protect 
the circuit components from moisture affection. Said 
housing has at its inner bottom an integrally made and 
concentrically protruding supporting portion whereto a 
circuit board with circuit components mounted thereon
