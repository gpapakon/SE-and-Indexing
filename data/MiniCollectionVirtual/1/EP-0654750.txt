<ABSTRACT>
Image data define an image that shows an input graphical representation (12) whose 
configuration represents information. The image can show a sketch, for example. The image 

data are used to obtain category data (20) indicating a category of graphical representations. 
For example, the category data (20) could indicate any of X-Y graph, directed graph, 

undirected graph, bar graph, pie chart, line graph, scatter plot, circuit diagram, flow chart, 
Venn diagram, state-transition diagram, tree, table, matrix, or array. The category data (20) 

could also indicate a specific category within a generic category such as bar graph or pie chart. 
The category data (20) can be obtained by determining whether the graphical representation 

(12) satisfies a constraint on each category. Each category's constraint may be applied to parts 
of the input image (10) that meet a feature candidate criterion, which may be different for 

each specific category in a generic category, even though the feature candidates must satisfy 
another constraint that is the same for all specific categories in the generic category. The 

category data (20) are then used to obtain content data (30) indicating information 
represented by the input graphical representation's configuration, and an output image (40) is 

obtained with an output graphical representation (42), with a configuration representing the 
information indicated by the content data (30). The output graphical representation (42) can 

be more precisely formed than the input graphical representation (12). The output graphical 
representation (42) can be in the same generic category as the input graphical representation, 

but possibly in a different specific category, or it can be in a different generic category.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to techniques for analyzing data defining an image, 
and more particularly to using a category to analyze an image showing a graphical 
representation. Takeda et al., US-A 5,228,100, describe techniques for producing from a document 
image a form display with blank fields and a program to input data to the blank fields. As 
shown and described in relation to Fig. 2, a document format recognition step recognizes an 
image of a document format to determine a format information item, a document 
construction step generates document content data associated with the document format, the 
system creates output data for the document data based on the resultant format and content 
data, and a document output step prints the output document data on a print form or stores it 
in a data file. According to the present invention there is provided a method for analyzing data 
defining an image, a method of operating a machine, a machine and an article of manufacture 
according to the appended claims. The invention is based on the observation that a graphical representation can be 
viewed as including two types of information. One type of information, referred to herein as 
"category", indicates one of a number of accepted categories of graphical representations, 
such as directed graphs, bar graphs, pie charts, and so on. The other type of information, 
referred to herein as "content", indicates the information represented by a particular instance 
of one of the accepted categories. In this respect, graphical representations are different from simple graphical 
elements, such as lines or curves, whose graphical shapes include intrinsic information about 
themselves, such as length, thickness, curvature, and so forth, but are not ordinarily used to 
represent information extrinsic to themselves unless combined to form a graphical 
representation in one of the accepted categories. Graphical representations are also different 
from symbols, such as characters and numbers, whose graphical shapes are typically used to 
communicate only a category. In other words, the spatial relations among elements in a 
graphical representation, referred to herein as its "configuration", provide an accepted way of 
communicating information other than a category. The manner in which a graphical representation is interpreted depends on its 
category. Therefore, the category of a graphical representation can be used to obtain 
information about how to extract its content. The criteria used to distinguish each
