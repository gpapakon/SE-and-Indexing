<ABSTRACT>
Within a reactor for catalytically processing gaseous fluids there takes place a heat exchange, besides the catalytic reaction, and only stationary catalysts are used through which the fluids flow in a single direction. For that purpose, fluid path-forming structures (10) are arranged in a reactor housing, the structures (10) form channels (19) and are provided, preferably coated with, a catalyst (12) in at least one area (11).
