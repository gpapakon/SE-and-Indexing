<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a power transmission device as set forth in the preamble 
of claim 1. Such transmissions are well-known in the state of the art. From US 3,951,006 it is known to provide the combination of an endless 
power transmission belt construction having opposed side edge means and 
having opposed inner surface means and outer surface means with said inner 
surface means defining a plurality of longitudinally disposed and alternately 
spaced apart like projections and grooves, said outer surface means being a 
substantially flat surface, a peripheral ribbed surface means meshing with a 
portion of the inner surface means of said belt construction and a second 
rotatable pulley means having a substantially flat outer surface means adapted 
to operate against said flat outer surface means of said belt construction, the 
outer flat surface thereof being adapted to be a driving surface for the 
substantially flat surface of said second pulley means. From US 4,822,324 it is known to provide an endless power transmission belt 
construction comprising a matrix made from an elastomeric material. It is also known to provide an endless power transmission belt construction 
having at least one of the tension section, compression section or load 
carrying section comprised of a rubber matrix having a plurality of discrete 
aramid fibers embedded therein, see US 4,127,039. Other belt constructions are disclosed in EP-A 0 349 434 and EP-A 0 425 
818. The compression section of the belt construction comprises a ribbed 
driving surface formed from a plurality of rib profiles, each of said profiles  
 
being formed as a "V". The profiles are adapted to mesh with an outer 
peripheral ribbed driving surface of a rotatable pulley. The driving surface as 
well as a surface opposed to said driving surface are both made from an 
elastomeric material, in particular from rubber, see EP-A 0 425 818. It has been found that the prior known ribbed belt constructions having a flat 
fabric surface on one side of the belt construction tend to trap abrasive 
particles from the environment, and especially from dusty, dirty or sandy 
environs, between the bundles of fibers comprising the fabric which 
contributes to a significant reduction in the life of the pulley means by tending 
to wear away the surface of said pulley means in a manner similar to grinding 
or sanding. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a new endless power 
transmission belt construction having a ribbed surface means that cooperates

<CLAIMS>
Power transmission device comprising 

a.) an endless power transmission belt construction having a tension 
section, a compression section and a load-carrying section disposed 

therebetween, said tension section comprising a flat driving surface 
and said compression section comprising a ribbed driving surface, 
b.) at least one first rotatable pulley having an outer peripheral ribbed 
surface meshing with a portion of said ribbed surface of said belt 

construction and 
c.) at least one second rotatable pulley having an outer substantially 
planar surface (30) being adapted to operate against said flat driving 

surface of said belt construction,
