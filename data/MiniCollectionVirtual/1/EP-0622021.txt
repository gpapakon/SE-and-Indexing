<ABSTRACT>
A plant for the stunning of animals to be slaughtered 
at a slaughterhouse, said plant comprising a system of boxes 

(4,113,114,115,132,133) which are movable between a filling 
area, in which the animals are led into a box, a stunning 

pit with an anaesthetic atmosphere for animals to be 
slaughtered and an area, in which the stunned animals are 

discharged from the box onto a table (9,116). The boxes 
(4,113,114,115,132,133) used are of the kind which share a 

common floor area, on which at least three animals to be 
slaughtered can move around. One wall (4a,126) of the box is 

openable in connection with the filling so that the animals 
can be led into the box. The wall (4b,125) of the box which 

is opposite the first wall, which has been opened in connection 
with the filling (4a,126), is opened in connection with 

the emptying of stunned animals from the box.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plant for the 
stunning of animals to be slaughtered at a slaughterhouse, 
said plant comprising a system of boxes which are movable 
between a filling area, in which the animals are led into a 
box, a stunning pit with an anaesthetic atmosphere for animals 
to be slaughtered and an area, in which the stunned 
animals are discharged from the box onto a table, which 
boxes share a common floor area, on which at least three 
animals to be slaughtered can move around, and a wall which 
is opened in connection with the filling so that the animals 
can be led into the box. The invention also relates to a method for the stunning 
of animals to be slaughtered at a slaughterhouse in a 
plant comprising a system of boxes which are movable between 
a filling area, in which the animals are led into a box, a 
stunning pit with an anaesthetic atmosphere for animals to 
be slaughtered and a discharge area, in which the stunned 
animals are discharged onto a table, which boxes share a 
common floor area, in which at least three animals to be 
slaughtered can move around, and a wall which is opened so 
that the animals in connection with the filling can be led 
into the box. Various systems are known for the stunning of hogs in 
an anaesthetic atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Normally, the 
system comprises a number of gondolas or boxes for the animals 
to be stunned. Each of the gondolas has only room for 
one or two animals, who are practically fixated in the gondola, 
the space being so limited that it allows no movement. 
In a commonly used type of gondola the animal enters at the 
end of the gondola, and when it has entered completely, the 
floor is swung down, the animal thereby falling somewhat 
downwards to rest fixedly against the slanting sidewalls of 
the gondola. Several gondolas are mutually connected in a 
so-called paternoster system, which ensures that the gondolas 
in turn are subjected to different phases of treatment.  
 
The first one is the driving in and fixation of an animal in 
the gondola. The next one is to lower a gondola with a fixated 
animal into a pit with stunning carbon dioxide. The 
last phase is to take up the gondola after the stunning of 
the animal on a level with a so-called discharge table, and 
the the stunned animal is discharged through one sidewall of 
the gondola and falls down on the table. An operator can 
then take care of suspending the animal in chains so that it 
can be transported by the conveyor of the slaughter line to 
a working

<CLAIMS>
A plant for the stunning of animals to be slaughtered 
at a slaughterhouse, said plant comprising a system of boxes 

(4,113,114,115,132,133) which are movable between a filling 
area, in which the animals are led into a box, a stunning 

pit with an anaesthetic atmosphere for animals to be 
slaughtered and an area, in which the stunned animals are 

discharged from the box onto a table (9,116), which boxes 
(4,113,114,115,132,133) share a common floor area, on which 

at least three animals to be slaughtered can move around, 
and a wall (4a,126) which is opened in connection with the 

filling so that the animals can be led into the box,characterized in that a wall (4b,125) opposite 
the first wall, which has been opened in connection with the 

filling (4a,126), is opened in connection with the emptying 
of stunned animals from the box. 
A plant according to claim 1, characterized 
in a common station for the filling of the animals 

into a box and for the emptying of the stunned animals from 
the boxes, after the animals have been lifted up from the 

pit to the station. 
A plant according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the boxes are placed side by side opposite 

the room of the grouping area and are separately lowerable 
into the pit containing the anaesthetic. 
A plant according to claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the boxes are only moved in an approximately 

vertical direction in the pit. 
A plant according to claims 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the pit below the level of the 

grouping area has a substantially bigger horizontal cross 
section than the boxes. 
A plant according to any of the claims 1 - 5,characterized in that for each room in the pen 
area two boxes are provided, which from the common station 

is lowerable to each theirs of two adjacent stunning positions 
at the bottom of the pit. 
A plant according to any of the claims 1 - 6,characterized in that in their uppermost position 
the boxes are surrounded by walls impeding air passage,

laminated wall. 
A plant according to any of the claims 1 - 7,characterized in that the table, onto which 
the animals are discharged, is a conveyor with loose or 

driven rollers. 
A plant according to any of the claims 1 - 8, 
said plants being provided with means for supplying a stunning 

medium for maintaining an anaesthetic atmosphere in the 
pit, characterized in that the boxes are provided
