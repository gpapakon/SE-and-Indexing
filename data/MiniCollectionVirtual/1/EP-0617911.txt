<ABSTRACT>
The brush container (1) is pivot mounted using a link (32) on the bottom end of a wall fixture (3). The lid (2) is pivot mounted using an angled lever (22) on the top end of the wall fixture (3). The lid and that part (23) of the angled lever joined to it exert a greater torque, in relation to the angled lever pivot axis, than the brush container including brush (4), on that part (27) of the angled lever resting on its top rim (14). The link has an arm (33) at the wall fixture lower end, on which the brush container is placed, with a holder (12) fixed to it.
