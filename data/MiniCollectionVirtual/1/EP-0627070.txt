<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for monitoring a signal being generated in dependence of the extension of said bag and being transmitted to a recording unit (17) remotely of said bag (18). At least one electric resonant circuit (11) is provided at said stoma bag (18) and is driven to an oscillating condition at a resonant frequency significant to said resonant circuit (11) while transmitting to ether a signal comprising electromagnetic energy. The resonant frequency is varied in dependence of the extension/stretching of said stoma bag (18) and the variation of resonant frequency is recorded in a receiver (16) in said recording unit (17) to generate, at certain conditions, an alarm. Said electric resonant circuit (11) comprises a resonant frequency determining means (18) interacting with the extension of said stoma bag (18), and an exciting means (15) is provided for driving said electric resonant circuit (11) to resonance.

<DESCRIPTION>
 .METHOD AND DEVICE FOR MONITORING A FLEXIBLE FLUID CONTAINERThe invention relates to a method of monitoring stretching conditions in a fluid container, especially a stoma bag, and a monitoring device in a fluid container made of flexible material provided preferably for monitoring overloading of stoma bags (stoma bandages) . A problem experienced by many stoma patients is that the stoma bag is overloaded and comes loose which may occur during night time when the patient is asleep and has no control over the stoma bag. When the stoma bag comes loose parts of the content in the stoma bag may leak and cause uneasiness. Obviously there is a great demand for an efficient and reliable monitoring device indicating in one way or the other that the stoma bag is filled up to a level where it conveniently should be emptied. However, the invention can be used also in other areas, for instance as a drain alarm for infusion bags.When a container made of flexible material is filled up with a fluid the pressure against the wall of the container is increased. According to US-A-3,546,944 a device sensing such pressure is disclosed. According to said patent a means is arranged over a fold of the wall of the container and is attached thereto on both sides of said fold. When a predetermined pressure has been reached in said container said means is torn apart while folding out said fold by the pressure in the container. However, said means may also be flexible so as to indicate during stretching thereof the level of stretching on a non- flexible scale. The alarm, or rather indication, that can be achieved by such a device is not intended to make an alarm for instance when a stoma bag is overloaded during sleep or when the bag cannot be visually observed at all times. However, an alarm at overload condition is generated with a device according to W090/11501. Said document discloses a monitoring device for fluid containers made of 

flexible material, preferably for monitoring an overload of stoma bags, comprising a flexible means which extends over an extendable section of the container wall while being fixedly attached to the container wall in the ends thereof. Said flexible means comprises a flexible resistor element having an electric resistance that is changed by the extension of said means and having a terminal for the connection thereof to an alarm device responding to any change of resistance in said resistor element. The measurement of resistance as described above requires some kind of power supply for said resistor
