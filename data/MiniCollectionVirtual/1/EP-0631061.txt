<ABSTRACT>
Minimum friction, tapered or cylindrical roller bearings 
consisting of rollers (3) having two or more different diameters 

(d / d₁ / d₂ / d₃) leaning on and rolling over the raceway inner 
(2) and outer (1) rings, and having equality relationships 

between them; that is to say, the relationship between the outer 
raceway diameter (D₁) and the supporting roller diameter (d₁) 

keeps the same proportion to that of the inner raceway diameter 
(D) with the leaning and rolling roller diameter (d), so that 

the peripheric speed developed by the roller (3) is the same 
both for the outer raceway ring (1) and the inner raceway ring 

(2). Being the rollers (3) and rings (1 and 2) peripheric speed 
the same, there are no slippages, achieving minimum friction and 

avoiding heating, wear, clearances and noises, improving the 
accuracy, service life and obtaining a superior performance from 

the tapered or cylindrical roller bearings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to both cylindrical and tapered roller 
bearings comprising rolling elements (rollers) rotating in 
unison between the inner and outer raceways. This is achieved by 
balancing the relationships between the runs (or raceway covered 
in one turn) of the inner and outer diameters, with the 
different diameters of the rolling elements of cylindrical 
and/or tapered rollers.
 
Balancing raceways results in a minimum friction between the 
three basic elements of a bearing: outer ring, inner ring and 
rolling elements (rollers). The bearings are machine elements or members, consisting of a 
set of concentrical rings in which balls, rollers or other 
rolling elements are fitted that, when a shaft rotates, make a 
so-called hearing movement allowing to considerably reduce the 
friction which would otherwise take place between the fixed and 
the movable element.
 
There are bearings in a number of different models, dimensions 
and capacities which, according to the way they work, are 
divided into three main groups: 1) radial , if they only support 
standard loads on the shaft, 2 ) thrust, when the loads are 
parallel to the shaft, and 3) radial-thrust, when they support 
both loads at the same time.
 
 
The antecedents of use and manufacture are very numerous. Being 
a very valuable machine accesory, there is a variety of 
standardized series available. You only need to take a look to 
any catalog from important companies like SKF, FAG, TIMKEN, 
COYO, NACHI, etc. to observe the well-known technique. 
Paradoxically, with the present state-of-the-art the rolling 
elements (rollers) of all the types of bearings are not rolling 
over their whole perimeter but rubbing to a great extent 
proportional to the difference existing between their 
inner/outer diameters, keeping an only diameter as a rolling 
element. For instance, a bearing having an inner raceway 
diameter of 84 mm and an outer diameter of 60, after a shaft 
mounted on this bearing turns one revolution, the track or 
raceway the rolling element will have to cover shall be:
 
dia. 84 x 3.1416 = 263.8937 mm
 
dia. 60 x 3.1416 = 188.4955 mm
 
and, being this impossible, the existing difference slips or 
rubs the raceway against the rolling element. The result of the 
described example gives a difference of 75.3982 mm after one 
turn; assuming a shaft turning at 1,000 revolutions per minute, 
it will give 75.398 meters. After one working hour it would give 
4,523.88 meters and after a whole working day it will be:
 
4,523.88 x 24 =

<CLAIMS>
Minimum friction, cylindrical or tapered roller bearings 
having an Inner ring (1) concentrical to an Outer ring (2), 

between which rolling elements (3) are housed, guided by roller 
spacers or a Cage (4). The cylindrical rollers (3) have two 

different contact diameters, one leaning on and rolling over the 
outer raceway (D), with the roller diameter (d) and the inner 

raceway diameter (D₁) of the Outer ring (2), and the other 
diameter of the cylindrical roller (d₁) being characterized by a 

relationship of equality between their diameters (D : d) and (D₁ 
: d₁), thereby achieving a synchronized balancing of peripheric 

speeds between the rolling elements (3) and the inner (1) and 
outer (2) rings, thus making all the rollers roll with minimum 

friction. 
Minimum friction cylindrical or tapered roller bearings, 
according to claim 1 . When housed on the Inner (1) and Outer (2) 

rings, the tapered rollers (3) as rolling elements generate 
several different diameters as a result of their tapering. 

Therefore, the diameters (d / d₂) roll leaning on the diameters 
(D / D₂) of the Inner raceway ring (2) while the diameters (D / 

D₂) of the Outer raceway ring (1) roll over the diameters of the 
 

tapered rollers (d₁ and d₃) characterized by equality 
relationships between their diameters 

(D : d) = (D₁ : d₁) = (D₂ 
: d₂) = (D₃ : d₃) = any existing relationships developing equal 

peripheric speeds between the Inner ring (1), the Outer ring (2) 
and the tapered rollers (3)  

. 
Roller bearings, according to the previous claims, having 
rolling elements (3) projecting one or more supporting lines 

over which they roll in their diameters (d₁/d₃) over the Inner 
raceway ring "C", while the lines of the rolling elements keep a 

minimum clearance avoiding constant friction but allowing "A" 
Dampening when sudden or abnormal loads occur. The diameters of 

the rolling elements (d / d₃) form one or more "B" lines rolling 
leaning on the raceway Ring (1).
