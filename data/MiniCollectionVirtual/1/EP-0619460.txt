The said coupling is fitted at the end of the tube 
or bipolar electric conductor with a heat insulating head (1) 

within which there is provided an axial housing for a 
female terminal (8) terminating the lead wire (9) that lies at 

the centre of the thermocouple tube, the said head being 
covered with a metallic sheath (4) that in turn establishes 

electric continuity with the metallic sheath of the 
coaxial conductor or tube, which is the electric earth (2) in 

the thermocouple. 
It has been specifically designed to electrically 
connect a thermocouple to the respective magnetic group 

in a gas tap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coupling that has 
been specifically designed to electrically connect a 
thermocouple to the respective magnetic group in a gas 
tap the structural features of which are aimed at 
achieving a very fast coupling and a high reliability in 
operation. It is a known fact that thermocouples used in gas 
burners are designed to control the general gas flow 
toward such burners, working with a magnetic group, 
causing the gas flow to be shut off in the event of the 
flame being extinguished by accident. More specifically, 
this magnetic group, that permanently tends to be shut 
off, must be turned on by hand, operating directly upon 
a gas tap button, and stays on when the heat generated by 
the flame causes the thermocouple in turn to generate an 
electromotive force strong enough to hold the coil in the 
said magnetic group energised, which status is obviously 
discontinued when there is no longer an electromotive 
force upon the extinguishment of the heat source when the 
burner is switched off. It follows from the above that an electric 
connection must be provided between the thermocouple and 
the magnetic group, which is generally a tube that stands 
as both earth for the said electric connection and shield 
for a cable coaxially housed within it, duly electrically 
insulated from the surrounding tube or earth.  
 Nowadays, in order to electrically connect the 
thermocouple bipolar conductor to the magnetic group, the 
said conductor ends in a threaded connector secured to a 
lock nut established in the magnetic group, cf. US-A-2 503 459. 
According to US-A-2 379 712 the earth conductor is welded to a 
connector element which is screwed onto the gas tap housing. This threaded coupling operation is clearly slow and 
sometimes complicated, above all when the position of the 
magnetic group is such that access to the connection area 
is difficult, the space available to such end being 
small, such as, for instance, with extra-slim worktops. The fast coupling subject of the invention has been 
designed to fully solve the above problems and relies 
essentially on a coupling by simple axial plugging, 
whereby operation is extremely fast and simple, indeed 
almost instantaneous. More specifically and in order to achieve the above, 
the features of the coaxial coupling subject hereof lie 
in providing the end of the tube or bipolar electric 
conductor with a preferably resilient and basically 
cylindrical heat insulating head having a large diameter, 
within which there is

A coaxial coupling of a flame sensing thermocouple to the 
magnetic group (3) of a gas tap controlling gas flow in a burner, 

characterised in comprising a cylindrical 
head (1) made of electrically insulating material, 

connected to the free end of a thermocouple phase conductor (9), 
the head having a metallic sheath (4) establishing electric 

continuity with a conductor earth element (2), the 
said head having inside a female terminal (8) duly connected 

to the thermocouple phase conductor (9), the said female terminal 
being designed to receive by plugging a corresponding 

male terminal (11) associated to the magnetic group (3) in a magnetic group housing and that 
is attached to said magnetic group with the assistance of a 

metallic collar (12) that, in addition to making up the 
mechanical means of attachment for such male terminal 

through the respective packing, extends to form a front neck 
for coupling by plugging to the metallic sheath (4) in the head (1), to 

establish electric continuity between the earth of 
the head and the magnetic group housing. 
A coaxial coupling of the thermocouple to the 
magnetic group controlling gas flow in burners, as in 

claim one, characterised in that the said metallic collar (12) 
is coupled to the magnetic group (3) inserting a sort of 

centre plate (13) that is electrically insulating by nature, 
within which there is provided a pair of rings (14,14') working in 

the packing axially fitting the male terminal (11), the said 
male terminal being provided to be hollow and a straight 

extension of the conductor making up the magnetic group 
solenoid at the bottom of the said electrically 

insulating centre plate (13) axially crossing the male 
terminal and being fitted at its free end to the free end 

of the latter by means of a spot weld (17) that ensures a 
smooth electric continuity.
