<ABSTRACT>
The engine includes 
an exhaust gas turbo supercharger (40), an air cooler 

(6) and an expansion turbine (9), wherein high-pressure 
air compressed by a compressor (5) in the 

supercharger (40) is brought to a low temperature in 
the expansion turbine ( 9) and then delivered to a 

cylinder (1) in the engine; 
A part of the 

air compressed by the compressor (5) in the scavenge turbo 
supercharger (40) and cooled by the air cooler (6) is led 

directly to a scavenge port (10), the remainder is converted 
to a low-temperature high-pressure supercharging air through 

a second-stage compressor (22), a third-stage compressor (7) 
and the expansion turbine (9), and this supercharging air is 

charged into the cylinder (1) through an air supply valve 
(2) provided in the cylinder (1) just after a scavenge-exhaust 

stroke to increase a filling amount.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in 
a turbo cooling engine, which is being put to practical use 
for the purpose of reducing nitrogen oxides in a scavenging 
gas, especially in a uniflow scavenging type 2-cycle diesel 
engine. In the art of diesel engines, especially of 
uniflow scavenging type 2-cycle diesel engines, for the 
purpose of reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) in a scavenging 
gas, a turbo cooling engine, in which a high-pressure 
supercharging air compressed by a compressor in an exhaust 
gas turbo supercharger is brought to a low temperature 
through expansion with an expansion turbine and then it is 
supplied to the engine, is being put to practical use. One example of a turbo cooling engine in the prior 
art is shown in Fig. 2. In this figure, reference numeral 
01 designates a cylinder of the engine, numeral 02 
designates an exhaust valve, numeral 03 designates an 
exhaust pipe, numeral 04 designates an exhaust gas turbine 
in an exhaust gas turbo supercharger 040 driven by an 
exhaust gas supplied through the exhaust pipe 03, numeral 05  
 
designates a compressor rotationally driven by the exhaust 
gas turbine 04, numeral 06 designates an air cooler for 
cooling a pressurized air compressed by the compressor 05, 
numeral 013 designates a piston of the engine, numeral 010 
designates a scavenging chamber of the engine, and numeral 
011 designates scavenging ports drilled in the wall of the 
cylinder 01 at equal intervals along the circumferential 
direction. Reference numeral 07 designates a second-stage 
compressor for further compressing the air fed from the 
air cooler 06 through an air passageway 012, numeral 08 
designates a second air cooler for cooling the air 
compressed by the compressor 07, numeral 09 designates an 
expansion turbine for bringing the high-pressure air cooled 
by the second air cooler 08 to a low temperature through 
expansion and also rotationally driving the second-stage 
compressor 07, and numeral 014 designates an air passageway 
for supplying the low-temperature air delivered from the 
expansion turbine 09 to the scavenging chamber. In the above-described turbo cooling engine, the 
air pressurized by the compressor 05 and cooled in the air 
cooler 06 is pressurized to a further high pressure by the 
second-stage compressor 07, and after it has been cooled in 
the second air cooler 08, it is brought to a low temperature 
through expansion in the expansion turbine 09, and then it  
 
is supplied into the cylinder 01 through the scavenging 
chamber
