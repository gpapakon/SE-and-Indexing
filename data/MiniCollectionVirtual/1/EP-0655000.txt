<ABSTRACT>
A sterilisation testing device has a chamber for receiving an indicator and a duct for supplying the sterilisation atmosphere to the chamber, which otherwise is or may be sealed from the sterilisation atmosphere. The supply duct has the form of a spiral arranged inside a housing. In a possible embodiment, the supply line is formed by a threaded rod inside a threaded bore, a continuous recess being formed in the flanks of the thread of the threaded rod and/or threaded sleeve. A small testing device is thus created which allows the test result to be reliably indicated and offers a high protection against intentional or unintentional manipulations.
