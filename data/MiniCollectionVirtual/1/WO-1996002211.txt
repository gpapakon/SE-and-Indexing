<ABSTRACT>
An improved stent provides mechanical anchoring of the stent to a blood or other body vessel. The stent has, in a preferred embodiment, barbs (18) which remain within the surface of the stent when the stent is in its unexpanded condition, but which extend from the surface of the stent when the stent is expanded. These barbs (18) are adapted to engage, for example, a graft and/or the inner layers of a blood vessel to mechanically attach the stent to the vessel. Because friction is not solely relied upon to hold the stent in place, the stent may exert less force on the blood vessel which, in turn, means that a thinner stent requiring less force for expansion may be used. In addition, there may be less radial force permanentely exerted in an artery after stent deployment which may be less injurious to the vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INTRALUMINAL STENTField of the InventionThis invention relates to intraluminal stents and, more particularly, to intraluminal stents of the type used to retain a grafted stent within a blood vessel.Background of the InventionEndoluminal grafts have been used to repair blood vessels affected with any of a variety of lesions which can compromise circulation through the blood vessel to a portion of the body. The graft may be made of dacron, expanded polytetrafluoroethelyne (ePTFE) , or a natural substitute such as a vein or artery taken from another portion of the body. Typically, the graft is held in place within a blood vessel by means of an expandable stent.A variety of different stents have been used and proposed for this purpose. One stent, known as a Palmaz stent, has been used as a means for anchoring a graft within a blood vessel. The Palmaz stent is illustrated in Figs. 1A and IB of Palmaz U.S. Patent No. 5,102,417. In this patent, the Palmaz stent is characterized as an "expandable intraluminal graft". The patent contains an extensive description of the prior art and the problems which the Palmaz stent was designed to overcome. Patent No. 5,102,417 (the "Palmaz patent") and its parents are hereby incorporated by reference into this specification.The basic Palmaz stent comprises a mesh-like tubular member which can be expanded from a first diameter to a second diameter. The stent may be expanded by means of a balloon catheter, the force applied by the balloon exceeding the 

 elastic limit of the stent so that when the balloon is deflated, the stent remains in its expanded form. Since expansion of the stent can be closely controlled, if the stent is expanded into contact with the surface of a blood vessel, a graft positioned between the stent and blood vessel can be secured within the blood vessel.As explained in the Palmaz patent, the Palmaz stent provides benefits in addition to the ability to anchor a graft at a desired location within a blood vessel. For example, the stent can be used by itself to prevent the recurrence of stenoses, and to prevent recoil of an elastic vascular stenosis. It is usable in critical vessels such as the left main coronary artery where the possibility of the intimal flap blocking blood flow limits the use of balloon dilatation procedures.Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides an improvement over the basic Palmaz stent in that it provides a means for mechanically anchoring the stent to the blood vessel. In the preferred embodiment, these means

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED ISt 1. A stent, comprising a tubular wall defined by a multiplicity of intersecting members forming a multiplicity of openings, said tubular wall being expandable from a first diameter to a second diameter upon application of a radially directed force to the interior surface of said wall, at least some of said intersecting members including a barb, each said barb lying flat in the surface of said tubular wall when it is unexpanded and extending out of the surface of said tubular wall when it is expanded.
2. A stent according to claim 1, wherein said barbs are colinear with the axis of said tubular member.
3. A stent according to claim 2, wherein said intersecting members include circumferential ribs, said barbs extending from said ribs.
4. A stent according to claim 1, wherein oblique slots are formed in said ribs at each intersection of a barb and rib.
5. A stent according to claim 2, wherein oblique slots are formed in said ribs at each intersection of a barb and rib.
6. A stent according to claim 3, wherein oblique slots are formed in said ribs at each intersection of a barb and rib.
