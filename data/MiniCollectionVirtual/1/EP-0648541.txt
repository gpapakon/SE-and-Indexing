<ABSTRACT>
A laboratory centrifuge with a rotor which has vessel holders and a motor which drives the said rotor in rotation and has an upright shaft, the stator of which motor is mounted on the housing of the centrifuge by means of sprung suspensions, and with a deactivation device which controls the motor and which uses an element attached to the stator and an element attached to the housing to determine the deflection of the stator occurring at the maximum acceptable limit imbalance and switches off the motor, is characterised in that one of the two elements is constructed as a field generator which produces a constant field and the other element is constructed as a field strength detector, the field strength detector being connected to an evaluation device which brings about deactivation when specific changes in the field strength which are produced by the deflection occur.

Laboratory centrifuge including a rotor (6) affording vessel mountings
and a motor rotating it with a vertically extending shaft (5), the stator (4)

of which is mounted on the housing (1) of the centrifuge by means of
resilient supports (3), and including a cut-off device (7) which controls

the motor and determines the deflection of the stator (4) which occurs in
the event of an imbalance with an element (13), which is secured to the

resiliently supported components of the centrifuge, and an element (11),
which is secured to the housing, one of the two elements being

constructed in the form of a field generator (13) generating a constant
field and the other element being constructed in the form of a field

strength detector (11), which is connected to an evaluation device (7)
which determines the field strength amplitudes and compares them with

a predetermined threshold amplitude which corresponds to a permissible
threshold imbalance and switches the motor off when the latter is

reached, characterised in that the evaluation device (7) has a calibration
device which determines the amplitude during calibration operation of

the centrifuge with a threshold imbalance and stores it as the threshold
amplitude in a permanent memory in the evaluation device.
Centrifuge as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the calibration
device (7) is constructed for operation in two calibration test runs and has

devices which determine an interpolation value of the two determined
amplitudes constituting the threshold amplitude. 
Centrifuge as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the field generator
is constructed in the form of a permanent magnet (13) and the field

strength detector is constructed in the form of a Hall detector (11).
Centrifuge as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the field generator
(13) is disposed on the stator (4) and the field strength detector (11) is

disposed on the housing (1).
