<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is provided that is adapted to be used in 
training surgeons and surgical personnel in surgical techniques 

and procedures, and more particularly to an apparatus and method 
for training surgeons and surgical personnel in minimally invasive 

surgical techniques and procedures in a manner which closely 
replicates clinical phenomena. The apparatus (10) of the invention 

includes a frame (22), a pump (12), appropriate 
tubing (18,24) and a reservoir (20) 

containing a volume of fluid (21). Non-living 
animal tissue (30) is joined 

to the tubing (24a,24b) at the outlet side of 
the pump (12) and surgical 

personnel are permitted to conduct surgical techniques thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus that is adapted
to be used in training surgeons and surgical personnel in surgical
techniques and procedures, and more particularly to an apparatus
and method for training surgeons and surgical personnel in
minimally invasive surgical techniques and procedures in a manner
which closely replicates clinical phenomena,
see for example US-A-5 149 270, which
discloses an
apparatus and a method according to the preambles
of claims 1 and 13 respectively.Surgical personnel are trained in surgical techniques and
procedures through a combination of teaching tools. Books and
other written source materials are utilized. Video tapes and
other audiovisual materials are also employed. Surgical personnel
also routinely attend lectures, seminars and the like.Surgical personnel receive clinical training and experience
through preceptor and proctor arrangements. These clinical
programs may employ actual patients, corpses, live animal models,
deceased animal models, or a combination thereof. Regardless of
the model employed, the objective is to provide surgical personnel
with a training system which will educate the personnel to the
clinical phenomena which may be expected in performing a given
technique or procedure.In providing surgical personnel training, it is desirable to
minimize to the extent possible the use of live animal models.
However, the use of non-living models in training programs, e.g.,
foam organs through "pelvic trainers", has heretofore limited the 
ability of surgical personnel to experience likely clinical
stimuli and responses.According to the present invention, an apparatus is provided
which allows surgical personnel to experience closely replicated
clinical phenomena with the use of non-living animal models. The
apparatus comprises a fluid reservoir, a pump, tubing
communicating between the fluid reservoir and the pump, and
additional tubing communicating between the pump and a discharge
point which is adapted to be associated with animal tissue.
Further tubing may also be provided which is adapted to
communicate between the non-living animal tissue and the
reservoir, thereby providing a discharge flow path for fluid from
the non-living animal tissue to the reservoir.In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus further comprises a
frame defining an interior region. In such preferred embodiment,
the discharge point of the additional tubing is adapted to be
positioned within the interior region such that non-living animal
tissue may be positioned and accessed

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for use in conducting surgical techniques
on non-living animal tissue, comprising:


(a) a frame (22) which includes a base (36) and which defines an
interior region above said base;
(b) a reservoir (20) for receiving and storing a volume of fluid;

   characterised in that it further comprises:

(c) a pump (12) including an inlet (14) and an outlet (16) for transferring
fluid from said reservoir (20) to said interior region of said frame;

and
(d) inlet tubing (18) associated with said pump inlet and said
reservoir; and
(e) outlet tubing (24) associated with said pump outlet and
adapted to be associated with non-living animal tissue positioned

in said interior region.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said frame further
includes a floor which rests upon said base and which is adapted

to support said non-animal tissue.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said floor comprises a
grate.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said pump provides a
pulsating fluid flow through said outlet tubing.
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein said pump is a
peristaltic pump.
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a medium
associated with said frame which extends above said interior

region. 
The apparatus of claim 6, wherein said frame further
comprises side walls and said frame is substantially air-tight.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said reservoir is
formed on said base of said frame.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said frame includes
inlet and outlet spigots to facilitate cleaning thereof.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said non-living animal
tissue is selected from the group consisting of animal organs

obtained from a slaughterhouse.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said volume of fluid
is selected such that said fluid exhibits physical properties

closely replicating corresponding physical properties of human
blood.
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising return
tubing which is adapted to be joined to said non-living animal

tissue and return fluid from said non-living animal tissue to said
reservoir.
A method for conducting surgical techniques on non-living
animal tissue, comprising:


(a) obtaining non-living animal tissue from an appropriate
source;

   characterised in that it further comprises:

(b) joining said non-living animal tissue to outlet tubing (24),
said outlet tubing being joined to a pump (12) at an opposite end;
(c) providing a reservoir (20) which contains a volume of fluid
and inlet tubing (18) extending from said reservoir to an inlet (14) of said

pump; and
(d) providing a frame (22) which includes a base (36);
(e) positioning said non-living animal tissue on said base (36) of
