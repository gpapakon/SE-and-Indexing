<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of processing of
semiconductor devices, and particularly to
a mask for optically transferring a lithographic pattern
corresponding to an integrated circuit (IC) from
said mask onto a semiconductor substrate,
said pattern including at least one feature
having at least one edge. Such a mask is
known from EP-A-0 110 042.In designing an integrated circuit (IC), engineers typically rely
upon computer simulation tools to help create a circuit schematic design
consisting of individual devices coupled together to perform a certain
function. To actually fabricate this circuit in a semiconductor substrate the
circuit must be translated into a physical representation, or layout, which
itself can then be transferred onto the silicon surface. Again, computer
aided design (CAD) tools assist layout designers in the task of translating
the discrete circuit elements into shapes which will embody the devices
themselves in the completed IC. These shapes make up the individual
components of the circuit, such as gate electrodes, field oxidation
regions, diffusion regions, metal interconnections, and so on. The
software programs employed by these CAD systems are usually
structured to function under a set of predetermined design rules in order
to produce a functional circuit. Often, these rules are determined by
certain processing and design limitations. For example, design rules
defining the space tolerance between devices or interconnect lines so as 
to ensure that the devices or lines do not interact with one another in any
unwanted manner.Design rule limitations are frequently referred to as critical
dimensions. A critical dimension of a circuit is commonly defined as the
smallest width of a line or the smallest space between two lines.
Consequently, the critical dimension determines the overall size and
density of the IC. In present IC technology, the smallest critical
dimension for most circuits is 0.5 Âµm for line widths and spacings.Once the layout of the circuit has been created, the next step to
manufacturing the integrated circuit (IC) is to transfer the layout onto a
semiconductor substrate. Photolithography is a well known process for
transferring geometric shapes present on a mask onto the surface of a
silicon wafer. In the field of IC lithographic processing a photosensitive
polymer film called photoresist is normally applied to a silicon substrate
wafer and then allowed to dry. An exposure tool is utilized to expose the
wafer with the proper geometrical patterns

<CLAIMS>
A mask for optically transferring a lithographic
pattern corresponding to an integrated circuit (IC) from

said mask onto a semiconductor substrate, said pattern
including at least one feature (44) having at least one

edge (44C),

characterized in that

at least one additional line (45) is provided, wherein said
at least one additional line (45) corresponds to, and is

disposed on said mask at a predetermined distance away from
said at least one edge (44C), said at least one additional

line (45) altering the edge intensity gradient of said at
least one edge (44C) to match the edge intensity gradient

of densely packed edges, and wherein said at least one
additional line (45) has a width sufficiently narrow so as

not to be transferred onto said substrate.
The mask of claim 1, wherein said at least one feature (44)
has a certain minimum dimension and said width is less than

one-half of said dimension.
The mask of claim 1 or 2, wherein said pattern includes
features (43, 44) each having associated edges (43B, 44B,

44C), a first portion (43B, 44B) of said edges being spaced
at a close proximity to one another such
 that pattern
dependent variations occur due to optical diffraction, and

a second portion (44C) of said edges being spaced
relatively distant from any other edge of said features,

and
 
a plurality of additional lines (45) are provided, wherein

each of said additional lines (45) corresponds to, and is
disposed on said mask at a predetermined distance away from

one of said edges (44C) of said second portion, said
additional lines (45) altering the edge intensity gradient

of said second portion (44C) of said edges to approximate
the edge intensity gradient of said first portion (43B,

44B) of said edges.
The mask of claim 3, wherein said additional lines (45)
have a width sufficiently narrow so as not to be

transferred onto said substrate.
The mask of claim 3 or 4, wherein said features (43, 44)
have a certain minimum dimension and said width is less

than one-half of said dimension.
The mask of claim 2 or 5, wherein said width is
approximately one-fifth of said dimension.
The mask of claim 6, wherein said predetermined distance is
approximately equal to said minimum dimension.
The mask of claim 7, wherein the mask is a dark field mask.
The mask of claim 6, wherein said predetermined distance is
approximately equal to 1.1 times said minimum dimension.
The mask of claim 9, wherein the mask is a clear field
mask.
