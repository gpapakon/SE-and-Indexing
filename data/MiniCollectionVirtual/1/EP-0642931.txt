<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a desensitizing solution for
lithographic platemaking. More particularly, it relates to a
desensitizing solution which is used in manufacturing printing
plates, such as an electrophotographic lithographic plate, a
silver salt plate, and a presensitized plate called a PS plate.Lithographic printing, i.e., offset printing is a
printing method comprising applying a desensitizing solution on
a printing plate precursor having thereon an image area
comprising an ink-receptive lipophilic layer and a non-image
area to thereby form a hydrophilic layer on the non-image area,
applying an oily ink to the lipophilic image area, and
transferring the ink on the image area to paper.Of the printing plate precursors, an
electrophotographic lithographic plate precursor comprising a
support, such as paper, having provided thereon a
photosensitive layer comprising a photoconductive powder, such
as zinc oxide, dispersed in a binder resin is produced by
forming an image by an electrophotographic technique. That is,
the photosensitive layer is charged, imagewise exposed to
light, and developed with a developing solution containing
lipophilic toner particles to form an image area. A
desensitizing solution is then applied whereby the desensitizer
in the desensitizing solution and the photoconductive powder on 
the surface form a hydrophilic substance which forms a
hydrophilic non-image area. The thus prepared lithographic
printing plate comprising a lipophilic area and a hydrophilic
area is mounted on a printing machine.The main components of conventional desensitizing
solutions are roughly divided into cyan substances and non-cyan
substances.Cyan substances, which contain a cyanide ion in the
molecule thereof as an inorganic complex, include ferrocyanides
and ferricyanides. These substances exhibit powerful
desensitizing ability and provide printing plates satisfying
printing characteristics as a whole. Labile to light or heat,
however, the cyan substances easily undergo discoloration or
sedimentation or reduce their desensitizing ability with time.
Further, the cyan substances themselves are stable and harmless
to human bodies but are decomposed under various environmental
conditions, such as irradiation of ultraviolet rays or a
radiation, to release harmful cyanide ions, which may cause
environmental problem. Furthermore, where a plate produced by
using a cyan substance-based desensitizing solution is used for
printing on neutral paper or printing with quick-drying color
inks, such unfavorable
