<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus having therein a recording material housing means
which houses recording materials, an image forming means which
forms an image on a recording material that is in transit, and
a conveyance means which conveys a recording material from the
recording material housing means to the image forming means
along a conveyance path.In the image forming apparatus such as a copying machine
of an electrophotographic type and a printer, a recording
material housed in a recording material housing means is
conveyed by a conveyance means, and image forming is conducted
by an image forming means on the recording material thus
conveyed. In recent years, there has been a strong demand for
improvement in the number of sheets for image forming per unit
time (productivity), and speedup of the conveyance speed 
(hereinafter referred to as "process speed") for the recording
material in the case of forming images with an image forming
means is now being sought, accordingly.For making a process speed higher, however, it is
necessary to increase strength of a housing of an image
forming apparatus, which results in a cost increase. Further,
when a process speed is higher, a time lag in the conveyance
timing makes misregistration of an image on a recording
material to be greater. Since the frictional resistance
between a recording material and a conveyance path is
increased and an extent of slippage between a recording
material and a conveying member is increased by the higher
process speed, in particular, a time lag in the conveyance
timing for the recording material and an extent of sheet
skewing are increased. In addition, when complying with many
types of recording materials, a time lag in conveyance timing
and an extent of sheet skewing vary depending on frictional
force between a recording material and a conveyance path and
that between a recording material and a conveying member which
are different from each other. Furthermore, when plural means
for loading recording materials are provided for complying
with many types of recording materials, a length of conveyance
path varies depending on each recording material loading means,
which makes a time lag in conveyance timing and an extent of 
sheet skewing to be different. When increasing the number of
images formed in the unit time by gathering the process speed,
therefore, it is necessary to enhance accuracy of conveyance
of recording sheets for forming images with high quality.For enhancing productivity of images, on
