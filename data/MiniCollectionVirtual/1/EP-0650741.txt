<ABSTRACT>
A guiding introducer for use in the right atrium comprised 
of a first, second and third section wherein the first section is 

a generally elongated straight section wherein merged with the 
distal end of the first section is a second section which is 

curved upward in a longitudinal curve wherein the distal end of 
the second section is merged with the third section. The guiding 

introducer is for use in sensing, pacing and ablating procedures 
in the right atrium of the human heart.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to introducers. More particularly,
this invention relates to guiding introducers of specific shapes
for use within the right atrium of the human heart.Introducers and catheters have been in use for medical
procedures for many years. For example, one use has been to
convey an electrical stimulus to a selected location within the
human body. Another common use is to monitor and make
measurements for diagnostic tests within the human body. Thus,
catheters may examine, diagnose and treat while positioned at a
specific location within the body which are otherwise
inaccessible without more invasive procedures. In use, catheters
may be inserted into a major vein or artery which is near the
body surface. The catheters are then guided to the specific
location for examination, diagnosis or treatment by manipulating
the catheter through the artery or vein of the human body.Catheters have become increasingly useful in remote and
difficult to reach locations within the body. However, the
utilization of these catheters is frequently limited because of
the need for the precise placement of the tip of the catheter at
a specific location within the body. Control of the movement of catheters to achieve such precise
placement is difficult because of the inherent structure of a
catheter. The body of a conventional catheter is long and
tubular. To provide sufficient control of the movement of the
catheter, it is necessary that its structure be somewhat rigid.
However, the catheter must not be so rigid as to prevent the
bending or curving necessary for movement through the vein,
artery or other body part to arrive at the specified location.
Further, the catheter must not be so rigid as to cause damage to
the artery, vein or body part while it is being moved within the
body.While it is important that the catheter not be so rigid as
to cause injury, it is also important that there be sufficient
rigidity in the catheter to accommodate torque control, i.e., the
ability to transmit a twisting force along the length of the
catheter. Sufficient torque control enables controlled
maneuverability of the catheter by the application of a twisting
force at the proximal end of the catheter that is transmitted
along the catheter to its distal end. The need for greater
torque control often conflicts with the need for reduced rigidity
to prevent injury to the body vessel.Catheters are used increasingly for medical procedures
involving the human heart. In these procedures a catheter is
typically advanced to the heart

A guiding introducer to be used in the right atrium of a human
heart comprised of a first, a second and a third section, wherein

the first section is a generally elongated straight section,
wherein merged with the

distal end of said first section of said introducer is the
second section which is curved in a longitudinal curve with a

radius of about 0.5 cm to about 2.5 cm to form an arc of
approximately 40 to 60 degrees, wherein merged with the distal

end of the second section is the third section, wherein said
third section comprises a generally straight section directed

at an angle of approximately 40 to 60 degrees from the
the first section.
