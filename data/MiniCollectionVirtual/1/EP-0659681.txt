<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a machine for filling containers having a plurality of filling elements (1) which are arranged in circle, there is assigned to each filling element a mount (2), which can be moved radially by means of a drive element (4), for a rinsing cap (3) which can be connected to the filling element and the rest position of which is situated inside a protective wall (5) which is arranged within the filling element in a radial fashion. Within the range of movement of each mount there is formed in the protective wall an aperture (6) which is sealed off by means of a lid (7) when the mount adopts its rest position.

Container filling machine with a plurality of circularly arranged 
filling elements, each of which being associated with a radially 

movable holder for a flushing cap which is connectable to the 
filling element and transferable by a drive element between a 

working position located below the filling element and an idle 
position located alongside the filling element, and a protective 

wall is provided radially within the filling elements, 

characterised in that
 the idle position of each holder (2, 37) is 
located radially within the protective wall (5), and the protective 

wall (5) is within the movement range of each holder (2, 37) and 
a thereby supported flushing cap (3) provided with an opening 

(6) which is closable by means of the cover (7) when the holder 
(2, 37) takes up the idle position. 
Container filling machine according to Claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 each filling element (1) is provided with its own opening 
(6) with its own cover (7). 
Container filling machine according to Claim 2, 
characterised 
in that
 the cover (7) is slightly smaller than the opening (6) and 
in its idle position aligned with the protective wall (5). 
Container filling machine according to Claim 2, 
characterised 
in that
 the cover (7) is slightly larger than the opening (6) and in 
its idle position abuts the outside of the protective wall (5). 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 

characterised in that
 the cover (7) is attached to the outer end 
of the holder (2, 37). 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
 each flushing cap is firmly connected to 
its holder. 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
 each flushing cap (3) is detachably 
received in its holder (2, 37).  

 
Container filling machine according to Claim 7, 
characterised 
in that
 each holder (2, 37) comprises a horizontal plate with a 
receiving bore (8) for a flushing cap (3). 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 

characterised in that
 each holder (2, 37) is displaceably 
mounted on at least one bar (9, 36) which is mounted on the 

inside of the protective wall (5). 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 

characterised in that
 each holder (2, 37) is engaged by its own 
drive element (4) in the form of a pneumatic cylinder. 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 

characterised in that
 each filling element (1) is associated with 
a carriage (11), the ascend and descend of which is controlled 

and which carries at the bottom end an inwardly, and if 
appropriate outwardly, open receptacle (12) for a flushing cap 

(3). 
Container filling machine according to Claim 11, 
characterised 
in that
 the receptacle (12) comprises fingers, which are 
arranged on opposite sides of the flushing cap (3) and which 

reach under a collar (10) or the like of the flushing cap (3). 
Container filling machine according to Claim 11 or 12, 

characterised in that
 each filling element (1) is associated with 
an adjustably controlled bolt (13), by means of which the 

associated carriage (11) is fixed in a top position, and a flushing 
cap (3), which is positioned in the receptacle (12), is connected 

to the filling element (1), if appropriate with a centring dome (22) 
thereinbetween. 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 

characterised in that
 the protective wall (5) is cylindrical. 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 9 to 14, 

characterised in that
 the bar (36) has an essentially C-shaped, 
downwardly open profile.  

 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 15, 

characterised in that
 on the inside of the protective wall (5) is 
arranged a cover (36) which closes the top opening of the 

flushing cap (3) in its idle position. 
Container filling machine according to Claims 15 and 16, 

characterised in that
 the cover is formed by the upper shank 
of the profiled bar (36). 
Container filling machine according to one of Claims 1 to 17, 

characterised in that
 the flushing cap (3) comprises a lower 
discharge opening (26) which is sealable by a valve (27), and 

that a control element (28) is provided which keeps the valve 
(27) open at least in the idle position of the holder (2)
 and the 
flushing cap (3). 
Container filling machine according to Claim 18, 
characterised 
in that
 the control element (28) is formed by a stop arranged on 
the holder (37) or its cover (7), which keeps the valve (27) open,
