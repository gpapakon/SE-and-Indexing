<ABSTRACT>
In a calibration method for an industrial robot (2-6), a 
calibration tool (8) supported by the robot hand (6) is 

brought into contact a spherical calibration body (7) with a 
known radius. Thereafter, the output signals from the position 

transducers of the robot axes are read and stored. This 
method is repeated a plurality of times with different robot 

configurations. Thereafter, the calibration parameters of 
the robot are calculated starting from the kinematic equations 

of the robot, a model of the relationship between axial 
position and position transducer signal, the known radius 

of the calibration body, and the read and stored position 
transducer signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for calibration of movement
axes of an industrial robot according to the precharacterising
part of claim 1.The invention also relates to an industrial robot system according
to the precharacterising part of claim 4 for carrying
out the method according to the invention.A typical industrial robot is previously known from US-A-3
909 600 and US-A-3 920 972. Such a robot has a stand which
is rotatably arranged on a foot and which supports a first
robot arm which is rotatable in relation to the stand. In
the outer end of this arm, and rotatable in relation
thereto, a second robot arm is arranged. In its outer end
this second arm supports a hand which is provided with a
tool attachment and which is rotatable in two or three degrees
of freedom in relation to the second arm. The robot is
provided with control equipment for controlling the position 
and orientation of the robot hand. For each one of the
above-mentioned axes of rotation, servo equipment, comprising
a driving motor and a position transducer, is provided,
the position transducer delivering a signal which is a measure
of the angle of rotation of the current axis in relation
to a reference position. To the servo system of each
axis there is supplied a desired value for the angle of
rotation of the axis, and the driving motor of the axis
causes the robot to move in the current axis until the angular
position indicated by the position transducer of the
axis corresponds to the desired value supplied to the servo
system.For the position and orientation of the robot hand to correspond
to the desired position and orientation, the mechanical
structure of the robot and the data which describe it
must be known with a high accuracy. This means that it is
not sufficient for the nominal robot model to be known but
also the individual deviations from the nominal model must
be known. These deviations may be: Variations in arm
lengths, deviations in the orientations of the axes of rotation
of the joints, or lateral displacements (offset) of the
axes. These deviations arise in the manufacture of the different
mechanical components and in the assembly of these.
To this is also to be added that the angle indicated by the
position transducer of an axis must with great accuracy correspond
to the actual angle of rotation of that mechanical
part of the robot which is control led with the aid of the
axis in question.Because of difficulties in carrying out the calibration in a
manner which is economical and adapted to production, the
current
