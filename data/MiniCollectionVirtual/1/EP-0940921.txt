<ABSTRACT>
A phase-locked loop comprises a charge pump controlled by a one-shot pulse and a
comparator output pulse. From a first voltage (132), first and

second currents are generated. The first current (134) is transformed into a third current (140)
by changing the polarity of the first current using a current minor (110). A first output pulse (148) is generated in

response to the comparator output pulse (44) and the third current and a second output
pulse (184) is generated in response to the one-shot pulse (52) and the second current (136).

The first and second output pulses (148,184) are added to create a charge pump output
signal used to adjust the phase-locked loop. The phase-locked loop is locked

onto a frequency when the first and second output pulses are approximately
equal such that they cancel when added. Creating the first and second currents

from the same first voltage (132) creates equal noise components in the first and the
second currents (134,136) such that the noise components cancel when the second and third

currents (136,140) are added creating a charge pump output signal with reduced noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to phase-locked loops, and more
particularly to an improved charge pump, disposed in the phase-locked loop,
which reduces noise in the phase-locked loop.Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are used in the vast majority of
communication systems, both to generate signals and to extract information
from received signals. A typical phase-locked loop generates a comparator
pulse and compares it to a one-shot pulse having a predetermined magnitude
and pulsewidth. The loop is locked onto a desired frequency when the
comparator pulse equals the one-shot pulse.A charge pump is typically used in a phase-locked loop to convert the
comparator and one-shot signals into analog signals suitable for controlling a
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). To accomplish this conversion, first and
second voltage rails are typically used to generate first and second voltages. 
The first voltage rail typically provides a positive voltage and the second voltage
rail typically provides a negative voltage. The first voltage is converted to a first
current and the second voltage is converted to a second current having a sign
opposite that of the first current. A first output pulse is generated in response to
the first current and the comparator pulse. A second output pulse is generated
in response to the second current and the one-shot pulse. The second output
pulse has a sign opposite that of the first output pulse. The first and second
output pulses are then added together. Since the first and second output
pulses are generated in response to the comparator and one-shot pulses, the
first output pulse will have the same pulsewidth and the same magnitude as the
second output pulse but will be opposite in sign when the phase-locked loop is
locked on a desired frequency. The first and second output pulses will thus
cancel when added. Since the comparator pulse and one-shot pulse cancel,
the charge pump output signal will be zero and no signal will be sent to the
VCO and the VCO will not change the frequency of the phase-locked loop. In
this way, the phase-locked loop locks onto a desired frequency. A more
detailed description of charge pumps in phase-locked loops can be found in the
article "Charge-Pump Phase-Lock Loops," Floyd M. Gardner, IEEE Transactions
on Communications, Vol. Com-28, No. 11 November 1980, 1849-1857.The first and second output pulses contain both do signal components
and noise signal components. The noise components have contributions from
many sources in the phase-locked loop. Of these
