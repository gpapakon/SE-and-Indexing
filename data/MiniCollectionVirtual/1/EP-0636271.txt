<ABSTRACT>
A ferroelectric device is constructed using a bottom electrode (11) composed of a conducting oxide such as RuOx on a substrate (10) such as silicon or silicon dioxide. A ferroelectric material such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT) (13) is deposited on the bottom electrode, and a conducting interlayer (12) is formed at the interface between the ferroelectric and the electrode. This interlayer is created by reaction between the materials of the ferroelectric and electrode, and in this case would be Pb2RU2O7-x. A conductive top layer may be a metal (14) is deposited over the ferroelectric. This layer may be a metal, or it may be the same type of materials as the bottom electrode, in which case another interlayer (15) can be formed at the interface. A device constructed in this manner has the property of lower degradation due to the fatigue, breakdown, and aging.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ferroelectric memory devices, and more
particularly to multilayer electrodes for nonvolatile dynamic random access
memory applications of ferroelectric materials.Ferroelectrics have long been recognized as potential materials for
nonvolatile storage of information. These materials are dielectric in nature and
exhibit spontaneous polarization which can be reversed by application of a suitable
electric field. The polarization P in these materials responds to an external
electric field E in a hysteresis fashion and thereby the materials exhibit bistable
properties (two distinct states of polarization) which remain even after removal
of the electric field. It is this hysteresis feature that makes ferroelectrics suitable
for nonvolatile memory storage. The dielectric nature of ferroelectrics and their
ability to display bistable properties can be used to make a ferroelectric capacitor
which stores binary digital information based on the polarization state of the
material. This opens up the possibilities of integrating a ferroelectric capacitor
into the existing Si and GaAs VLSI technology to make a commercial nonvolatile
random access memory.However, several problems need to be overcome before a commercially
viable memory product is available. One of the foremost among these problems
is the degradation properties of ferroelectric devices. Degradation properties
indude fatigue, low voltage breakdown, and aging. A common source for these 
degradation properties is the interaction between defects in the materials and the
ferroelectric-electrode interface/grain boundaries in the ferroelectric capacitor.Considering the problem of fatigue, ferroelectrics are noted to lose some
of their polarization as the polarization is reversed. This is known as fatigue
degradation, and is one of the prime obstacles to forming high quality ferroelectric
films. Fatigue occurs because of defect entrapment at the ferroelectric-electrode
interface. Asymmetric electrode-ferroelectric interfaces and/or non-uniform
domain distribution in the bulk can lead to asymmetric polarization on alternating
polarity. This results in an internal field difference which can cause effective one-directional
movement of defects like vacancies and mobile impurity ions. Since
the electrode-ferroelectric interface is chemically unstable, it provides sites of
lower potential energy to these defects relative to the bulk ferroelectric thereby
causing defect entrapment at these interfaces (see Yoo et al, "Fatigue Modeling
of Lead
