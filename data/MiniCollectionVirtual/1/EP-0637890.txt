<ABSTRACT>
A modular solid-state mass data storage 
device providing high-density, high-capacity storage of 

numerous full-length movies for video server applications. 
The mass data storage device employs a modular 

pipeline architecture in which a distributed array of 
controller/memory modules is arranged in parallel controller/memory 

channels on one or more controller/memory 
cards. The modular pipeline architecture allows the 

number of controller/memory modules in each channel to 

be easily configured to accommodate any required storage 
size and the number of controller/memory channels 

to be configured to accommodate any required storage 
size and transfer rate, without increasing latency 

time. The modular pipeline architecture also greatly 
simplifies the complexity of the memory controllers, 

and high-density packaging of the controller/memory 
modules provides compact storage for large amounts of 

data. An asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch allows 
multiple viewers to access the movies stored in the 

mass data storage device with independent VCR-like 
control of the movie being watched.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to mass data
storage devices and, more particularly, to solid-state
random access memory (RAM) mass data storage devices
for video server applications.Video-on-demand will provide home television
viewers the ability to watch movies of their choice at
any time of the day in the comfort of their homes. Centrally-located
video servers will store current popular
movies and allow thousands of viewers simultaneous
access to these movies at any one time. Less popular
current movies or older movies will be downloaded to
the video server upon demand. Home television sets will
be connected to the video servers by phone lines, using
either copper or fiber optic cables. Each viewer will
have independent VCR-like (Video Cassette Recorder)
control over the movie being watched.Each video server will include some type of
mass data storage device for storing the movies. Hard 
disk or optical disk storage devices could be used, but
the latency times are too long for independent VCR-like
control of numerous movies by thousands of viewers. Magnetic
tape does not allow for multiple accesses of a
movie at different times or independent VCR control of
a movie by different viewers. Therefore, the mass data
storage device will likely be a solid-state RAM storage
device. However, solid-state RAM mass data storage devices
still do not provide the high densities and large
memory capacities that are required by video servers,
even though refinements in semiconductor fabrication
techniques have reduced the unit cost and increased the
unit density of solid-state RAM memory devices. Accordingly,
there has been a need for a high-capacity solid-state
mass data storage device for video server applications.A typical example of video-on-demand system is disclosed in US-A-5133079.
Here, movies are stored in compression digital form in a Central
Distribution Library. The detailed structure of the Library is not specified.
Examples given are CD-ROM, WORM, hard disk and solid state memory.EP-A-0402135 discloses a picture reproducing apparatus in which one
or two frames of video data are stored in a memory and retrieved when selected for
output to a video monitor. The apparatus operates in conjunction with a video tape
recorder (VTR) or similar device and is used to provide a still video picture when
the VTR is engaged in a rewind or fast-forward operation. Thus, the memory of
such a device only needs to store one or two frames of video data. One example
of a suitable memory is illustrated which comprises an
