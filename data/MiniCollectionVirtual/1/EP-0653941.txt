<ABSTRACT>
Specific target delivery composition systems where growth factors are linked, optionally using an acid cleavable linker, to a polyaminomethylenephosphonic acid ligand and are especially suitable for site delivery to bone. When the acid cleavable linker is present, the composition is activated for the growth factors at the bone site while it remains inactive while circulating in the body. Process to make the compound and composition are also taught.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TARGETED DELIVERY OF GROWTH FACTORS FOR BONE REGENERATION This invention relates to specific target delivery systems, namely, delivery of growth promoting factors to bone for its regeneration by a chelant composition system Compositions containing these systems and a process for making them are also part of this inventionHistorically, many physical conditions and diseases exist which cause bone loss in mammals, e g , intentional and accidental traumatic injuries, osteoporosis and penodontal diseases Thus it is often desired in the medical and dental fields to provide a composition which will stimulate and enhance bone regeneration in a mammal, e g a human patient One class of proteins which may be useful for regeneration of bone is polypeptide growth factors (GF), which are also described as tissue growth promoting factors Growth factors are polypeptides which stimulate a defined population of target cells As multifunctional molecules, they may stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation as well as affect cell function, depending on the type of the target cells and the presence of other signal peptides Examples of growth factors are platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF's), insulin-like growth factors (IGF's), transforming growth factors (TGF) such as beta's (TGF-β's) and alpha (TGF-α), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF's) including acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and bone morphogenetic proteins (B P's), including osteogenic and osteoinductive factors Combinations of tissue growth factors may be beneficial for promoting bone regeneration For example the combinations of PDGF and IGF-I or PDGF and IGF-II promote bone regeneration and wound healing [See, for example, Lynch et al , Proc Nat'l Acad Sci (USA) 84, 7696-7700 (1987), Lynch et al , J. Clm Invest 84, 640-646 (1989), Lynch et al , J Clm Pβnodontol 16, 545-588 (1989), Lynch et al , J Penodontol 62, 458-467 (1991), and US Patents 4,861 ,757 and 5,019,559]PDGF's are polypeptides of about 28-35 kilodaltons (kD) They are found in numerous cell types in the body PDGF derived from human platelets contains two polypeptide sequences, PDGF-A and PDGF-B polypeptides [See H N Antoniades and M Hunkapiller Sc/ence 220, 963-965 (1983)] PDGF-A is encoded by a gene localized in chromosome 7 [C Betsholtz et al , Nature 32Q_, 695-699 (1986)], and PDGF-B is encoded by the s/s oncogene [R Doolittle et al , Science 221, 275- 277 (1983), Waterfield et al , Nature 304,
