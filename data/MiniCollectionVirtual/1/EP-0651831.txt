<ABSTRACT>
A dry cleaning system particularly suited for employing supercritical CO2 as the cleaning fluid consisting of a sealable cleaning vessel (10) containing a rotatable drum (110) adapted for holding soiled substrate, a cleaning fluid storage vessel (12), and a gas vaporizer vessel (11) for recycling used cleaning fluid is provided. The drum (110) is magnetically coupled to a motor (120) so that it can be rotated during the cleaning process. The system is adapted for automation which permits increased energy efficiency as the heating and cooling effect associated with CO2 gas condensation and expansion can be channeled to heat and cool various parts of the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to an energy
efficient dry cleaning system that employs supercritical
carbon dioxide and that provides improved cleaning with
decreased redeposition of contaminants, and reduces
damage to polymer substrates.Cleaning contaminants from metal, machinery,
precision parts, and textiles (dry cleaning) using
hydrocarbon and halogenated solvents has been practiced
for many years. Traditional dry cleaning machines
operate typically as follows: a soiled garment is
placed into a cylindrical "basket" inside a cleaning
chamber which is then sealed. A non-polar hydrocarbon
solvent is pumped into the chamber. The garment and
solvent are mixed together by rotating the basket for
the purpose of dissolving the soils and stains from the
garment into the solvent, while the solvent is
continuously filtered and recirculated in the chamber.
After the cleaning cycle, most of the solvent is
removed, filtered, and reused. Recently the environmental, health, and cost
risks associated with this practice has become obvious.
Carbon dioxide holds potential advantages among other
non-polar solvents for this type of cleaning. It avoids
many of the environmental, health, hazard, and cost
problems associated with more common solvents.Liquid/supercritical fluid carbon dioxide has
been suggested as an alternative to halocarbon solvents
in removing organic and inorganic contaminants from the
surfaces of metal parts and in cleaning fabrics. For
example, NASA Technical Brief MFA-29611 entitled
"Cleaning With Supercritical CO2" (March 1979) discusses
removal of oil and carbon tetrachloride residues from
metal. In addition, Maffei, U.S. Patent No. 4,012,194,
issued March 15, 1977, describes a dry cleaning system
in which chilled liquid carbon dioxide is used to
extract soils adhered to garments.Such methods suggested for cleaning fabrics
with a dense gas such as carbon dioxide have tended to
be restricted in usefulness because they have been based
on standard extraction processes where "clean" dense gas
is pumped into a chamber containing the substrate and
"dirty" dense gas is drained. This dilution process
severely restricts the cleaning efficiency, which is
needed for quick processing.Another problem with attempts to use carbon
dioxide in cleaning is the fact that the solvent power
of dense carbon dioxide is not high compared to ordinary
liquid solvents. Thus, there have been attempts to
overcome this solvent limitation.German Patent Application 3904514, published
August 23, 1990, describes a process in which

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning a substrate with a densified
gas comprising:


a sealable cleaning vessel (10) defining a compartment with
temperature change means (114) operatively associated therewith

for adjusting the temperature within the said compartment;
a rotatable drum (110) adapted to receive the substrate, the
drum being positionable inside the cleaning vessel compartment,

the substrate being selectably in contact with a densified first
gas when within the said compartment;
a storage vessel (12) in fluid communication with the
compartment;
a gas vaporizer vessel (11) in fluid communication with the
compartment, the storage vessel being in fluid communication with

and characterised in that it comprises means (103) for
subsequently introducing a compressed second gas at a selected

pressure into the said compartment for displacing the said
densified first gas, the said compressed second gas being non-polar

and being different from the said densified first gas, and
being in a condition at a lower density than the said first gas,

but at a pressure above atmospheric.

said storage means (12) is in fluid communication with said
compartment by second conduit means and wherein said apparatus

further comprises:

means (23, 82, 83) for injecting cleaning additives
into said cleaning vessel (10).

said apparatus further comprises:


cooling means (30) disposed in said second conduit
means for cooling gas from said storage vessel (12) below its

boiling point.
The cleaning apparatus as defined in claim 1 or 3
wherein said vaporizer vessel (11) further comprises:


means (40) for adjusting the gas temperature therein.
The cleaning apparatus as defined in claim 4 further
comprising:


filter means (50) for removing volatile contaminants
from gases in said first conduit means.
