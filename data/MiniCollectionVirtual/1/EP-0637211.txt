<ABSTRACT>
In order to separate insoluble fruit solids from soluble fruit liquids with improved efficiency and yield using a press (7), the method described calls first for water to be fed via a line (8) to a grinder (3') designed to crush the fruit. The soluble matter is then separated, with the press (7), as juice from the fruit solids. The dependence of the water feed on the fruit feed is controlled by a microprocessor (22).

Method of separating soluble matter from insoluble solid fractions in an at least
partly crushed, but not yet de-juiced cell formation, in particular of fruits, using a press,

centrifuge or decanter, as well as a solvent, characterised in that the solvent is first
supplied to the at least partly crushed, but not yet de-juiced cell formation and then the

liquid fractions of the mixture consisting of the cell formation and solvent are
separated from the solid fractions by means of the press (7), centrifuge or decanter.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that a liquid, in particular water,
alcohol or hydrochloric acid, is supplied as the solvent.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the supply of liquid is controlled
as a function of the quantity of cell formations supplied.
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that the quantity of liquid supplied is
at least 5 % of the quantity of cell formations supplied.
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that the quantity of liquid supplied is
controlled in proportion to the quantity of cell formations supplied in such a manner

that the juice yield is 90 % by weight of the quantity of cell formations supplied.
Method according to one of claims 2 to 5, in which the cell formations are crushed
by means of a mill (3, 3'), characterised in that the liquid is added upstream of the

mill (3, 3').
Method according to one of claims 2 to 5, in which the cell formations are crushed
by means of a mill (3, 3'), characterised in that the liquid is added downstream of

the mill (3,3').
Method according to one of claims 2 to 5, characterised in that enzymes are added
to the liquid before it is supplied.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the mixture
consisting of cell formations and solvent is subjected to excess pressure of air or 

nitrogen prior to the solid-liquid separation and is held under this excess pressure
for a holding time.
