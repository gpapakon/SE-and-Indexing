<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to altered antibodies which are substantially immuno silent by virtue of their containing selected germ-line amino acid residues which replace one or more corresponding somatically mutated residues in a native antibody. In a process for making a gene for use in preparing such an antibody, one or more somatically mutated amino acid residues in a native antibody are identified as suitable candidate(s) for alteration. A nucleotide coding sequence is made which codes for selected germ-line amino acid residues to replace the one or more somatically mutated amino acid residues. The altered antibody can have variable (V) regions which comprise complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which provide the antibody with capacity to bind a specific antigen; and a selected and predominantly germ-line framework. In processes for making a gene for use in the preparation of such an antibody, there are the steps of (i) obtaining CDR encoding nucleotide sequences which encode CDRs with specificity for the specific antigen and (ii) combining these CDR encoding nucleotide sequences with framework encoding nucleotide sequences which encode the selected germ-line framework.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns altered antibodies
and products and processes relating to such antibodies.Processes are described for the conversion of a
given antibody sequence by recombinant DNA techniques
towards the sequence of a known germ-line equivalent of
the same or a different species.The application of recombinant DNA technology to
monoclonal antibodies has enabled man-made improvements
in these antibodies to be implemented. In particular,
recombinant antibodies with improved application in
human healthcare have been created. The hybridoma
technology of Köhler and Milstein (Köhler, G. and
Milstein, C., Nature, 256, 495-497, 1975) has been used
for the creation of many thousands of rodent monoclonal
antibodies but it has proved very difficult to use this
technology to create human antibodies.EP125023 (Genentech) and EP120694 (Celltech)
disclose the development of chimaeric antibodies through
recombinant DNA comprising antibody variable (v) and
constant (C) regions from different species and sources.
Typically, this technology has been applied to creation
of pharmaceutical antibodies with mouse V regions and
human constant regions such as those described by
LoBuglio, A.F. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86,
4220-4224, 1989. Nevertheless, the foreign V region in
such antibodies is likely to provoke an immune response 
(see Bruggemann, M. et al., J. Exp. Med., 170, 2153-2157,
1989) thus limiting therapeutic effectiveness.An alternative to chimaeric antibodies is taught by
GB2188638 (Winter) whereby the antibody V region
comprises of complementarity determining regions (CDRs)
and V region frameworks from different sources. The
process for producing such re-shaped (CDR-grafted)
antibodies has been applied to the creation of
pharmaceutical antibodies incorporating rodent CDRs,
human V region frameworks and human constant regions
(Riechmann, L. et al., Nature, 332, 323-327, 1988).
Thus the V region in such antibodies is less likely to
provoke an immune response in human patients than the
corresponding region in the previously described
chimaeric antibodies.The ontogeny of antibody production in living
mammals is a complex process, but nevertheless has been
well described for example in Roitt, I., Essential
Immunology, Blackwell Scientific Publishers. All
mammals have genetic loci corresponding to
immunoglobulin heavy and light chains which comprise
multiple segments of V region genes. For example, there
are about 500 mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in
addition to multiple constant region
