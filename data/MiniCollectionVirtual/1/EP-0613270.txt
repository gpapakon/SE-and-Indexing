<ABSTRACT>
A network analysis method for use in relation to a network having a plurality of 
entities, each with associated traffic, involves an analysis task comprising the steps of 

monitoring the network to collect data on entity traffic for a period of network operation, 
analyzing this data in respect of an entity operational characteristic by which the entities 

may be ordered into a ranking, forming an end set of at least one entity at one end of said 
ranking, and storing the identity of the or each entity making up that end set. The analysis 

task is carried out for a succession of N periods, where N is an integer greater than unity, 
to form an extended historical record of entities in the end sets for those N periods; the 

analysis task is then carried out for a further period and the entities in the resulting newly-created 
end set are compared with the entities in the extended historical record, to identify 

any entity (an 'unusually-behaved' entity) that is in the newly-created end set but not also 
in the historical record.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a network analysis method for use in relation to
a network having a plurality of nodes operative to source and/or sink traffic.A network analysis method is disclosed in IBM TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE BULLETIN,
vol. 23, no. 9, February 1981, NEW YORK, US, pages 4282-4288, ANONYMOUS:
'Communications Statistical Network Analysis Program.', which identifies network
problems by comparing the present performance with performance at a selected time
in the past where the performance was known to be good, and which is stores in a data
base of statistical data of the communications network.As network monitoring systems become more and more sophisticated and
comprehensive, the network operator has an increasing problem of identifying
significant data amongst the volumes of data on network performance provided by
such monitoring system.It is an object of the present invention to facilitate the identification of significant
data items relevant to management of a network.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a network
analysis method for use in relation to a network having a plurality of entities each
with associated traffic, the method involving an analysis task comprising the steps
of monitoring the network to collect data on entity traffic for a period of network
operation, analyzing this data in respect of an entity operational characteristic by
which the entities may be ordered into a ranking, forming an end set of at least
one entity at one end of said ranking, and storing the identity of the or each entity
making up that end set; said method comprising the steps of:-
(1) carrying out said analysis task for a succession of N said periods, where
N is a integer greater than unity, thereby to form an extended historical
record of entities in said end sets for said N periods; and(2) carrying out said analysis task for a further said period and comparing the
entities in the end set newly created thereby with the entities in said
extended historical record thereby to identify any entity, herein an
unusually-behaved entity, that is in the newly-created end set but not also 
in said record.The network entities under consideration will usually be the network nodes;
however, the entities may also be node pairings, logical segments, segment
pairings, external destinations or any other suitable classification of resources
associated with the network.The analysis task may, for example, involve monitoring network traffic for an
hour, this being repeated in step (1)

<CLAIMS>
A network analysis method for use in a network having a
plurality of entities each with associated traffic, the method involving a

analysis task comprising the steps of monitoring the network to collect data
on entity traffic for a period of network operation, analyzing this data In

respect of a entity operational characteristic by which the entities may be
ordered into a ranking, forming a end set of at least one entity at one end

of said ranking, and storing the identity of the or each entity making up
that end set; said method comprising the steps of:-


(1) carrying out said analysis task for a succession of N said periods,
where N is an integer greater than unity, thereby to form an

extended historical record of entities in said end sets for said N
periods; and
(2) carrying out said analysis task for a further said period and
comparing the entities in the end set newly created thereby with the

entities in said extended historical record thereby to identify any
entity, herein an unusually-behaved entity, that is in the newly-created

end set but not also in said record.
A method according to claim 1, wherein step (2) further includes, after
identification of any said unusually-behaved entities, updating said extended

historical record by replacing the entities that are there because of their
presence in the end set relevant to the eldest of the N periods covered by

the record, with the entities of the end set newly created in step (2); step
(2) being repeated for successive said periods whereby to identify said

unusually-behaved entities on an on-going basis. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said analysis task
analyses the traffic data in respect of a plurality of different said

operational characteristics; step (1) being operative to keep a respective
said extended historical record in respect of each said operational

characteristic, and step (2) identifying as an unusually-behaved entity, any
entity identified as such in relation to at least one said operational

characteristic.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each said entity is a
node of the network.
A method according to claim 4, wherein the said end set formed by the
said analysis task is one of the following:


top source nodes for traffic;
top destination nodes for traffic;
top server nodes;
top client nodes;
top source nodes for broadcasts;
top source nodes for multicasts.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each said entity is a
pairing of nodes of the network.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each said entity is a
sub-network of the network.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each said entity is a
pairing of sub-networks of the network. 
A method according to claim 7 or claim 8, wherein each said sub-network
is a logical segment of the network.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein each said entity is a
destination external to the network.
A method according to any one of claims 6 to 10, wherein the said end set
formed by the said analysis task represents the top communicating entities.
