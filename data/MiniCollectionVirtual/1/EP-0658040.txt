<ABSTRACT>
A method of generating an output device control signal 
having portions representing the content of pixels of an 

image including at least two types of image content 
comprises: passing data defining the content of each pixel 

of the image at a lower, first resolution and a higher, 
second resolution respectively through a pair of processing 

paths (2,3), one corresponding to each image content type. 
A binary control signal is generated from the first 
resolution data in the first path (2) by applying a 

stochastic screen. 
The binary control signal resulting from the 
stochastic screen is adapted
 to conform with the data at 
the second resolution; and the output device control signal 

is generated by combining data from the two processing 
paths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
generating an output device control signal having portions 
representing the content of pixels of an image. Such control signals are used conventionally, for 
example to modulate a laser beam which exposes a film or a 
plate to generate half-tone dot separations and the like, 
on which directly images a press. Conventionally, coloured images have been printed 
using half-tone technology in which dots are laid down on 
a rigid grid, the area of each dot varying depending upon 
the colour density component content of the corresponding 
pixel. This has led to problems of moiré and the like 
which have been solved by using different screen angles for 
different colour separations. Recently, a new type of 
screening technique has been developed known as stochastic 
screening (e.g. the Hell-Linotype Diamond screening 
device). Stochastic screening techniques vary the size, 
shape, and placement of dots through the use of statistical 
methods. In this way, the problems of moire and the like 
are avoided. Stochastic screening is particularly useful 
where the colour content of an image is changing but on 
occasion some problems arise in areas of flat tint where 
the stochastic nature of the screen becomes visible and in 
the case of line work or text where it is necessary to 
achieve very fine resolution but the output resolution from 
a stochastic screen is too coarse due to printing 
technology resolution units with this type of data. This is because high quality text requires a minimum 
of around 2400 dpi resolution or else "jaggies" can be 
seen. However, because the stochastic screening process 
will break up the data structure using a pseudo random 
effect, the correlated grouping of text/picture/raster 
elements (textels) will not exist as in conventional 
(angled) screening (except for 100%) values.  This means that we are trying to print individual 
textels, i.e. a text element, the lowest addressable 
element in the output. Now, physical limitations in the 
print process mean that we cannot at present practically 
transfer (hold) ink from press roller etc. to media with 
elements less than around 14 microns (1800 dpi). This therefore introduces a physical upper resolution 
limit of 1800 dpi with stochastic methods with current 
print technology. Note: it is the print technology and not 
the stochastic screening process which is the limit. Therefore, the stochastic limit is 1800 dpi, and too 
low for good quality text reproduction which requires a 
min
