<ABSTRACT>
Soft material to be cut, such as cakes (K), which is fed into a conveying section (14) on sheets (16) is cut up by means of a cutting device (10) which supports above a frame (12) two cutter stations (A, B), for example, which are situated one behind the other and have, for each cutting direction (L, Q; angle  alpha ) a set (30, 31) of pairs of cutters (32) which are arranged parallel to one another in a supporting frame (41) having drives (20, 21) which can be operated simultaneously or independently. The individual cutters, which are provided externally with a nonstick coating (39), of the pairs (32) are made to reciprocate in opposite directions during a downwardly guided cut by an eccentric drive (20, 21) with a cam shaft (22) via back extension arms (34) on the individual cutters of the pairs of cutters (32), their cutting edges (33) sliding along one another in pairs in a self-sharpening manner. The supporting frame (41) is moved by a raising and lowering drive (60) along vertical guides (62) between a position of readiness and a working position which is delimited close to the floor.

A cutting device (10), namely for flexible cutting 
material transported on sheets (16), for instance cakes 

(K), flat-shaped cream and whipped-cream pastries, or the 
like, comprising a frame (22) carrying a mounting (40) 

including a set of motor-driven, equidistantly arranged 
pairs of knives (30, 31) which are guided in parallel 

with one another from the top to the bottom through said 
cutting material (K) and are upwardly removed after 

cutting, the individual knives (32) of each pair of 
knives (30, 31) being oppositely movable backwards and 

forwards during a cut, thereby sliding along one another,
characterized
 in that at least two knife 
stations (A, B) are positioned one after the other above 

a conveyor path (14) on which said sheets (16) with said 
cutting material (K) enter and exit, and each of said 

knife stations (A, B) comprises a set of parallel pairs 
of knives (30, 31) for cutting in at least two directions 

(L; Q), said pairs of knives (30, 31) being at an angle 
(α) to one other, e.g. at 90° or 60°, and that said pairs 

of knives (30, 31) are each displaceably supported 
between knife guides (43, 44), said individual knives 

(32) being each provided with back extensions (34) 
including bearing openings (35) for receiving eccentric 

bearings (25). 
The device according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that said knife stations 
(A, B) are arranged within a joint support frame (41), 

are each provided with a drive (20, 21) and can be 
selectively operated simultaneously or independently. 
The device according to claim 2,
characterized
 in that the drives (20, 21) 
of said knife stations (A, B) are eccentric drives having 

eccentric shafts (22). 
The device according to claim 2 or 3,
characterized
 in that said knife guides 
(43, 44) are retained in said support frame (41) 

successively at offset angles, preferably at 90°, in such 
a manner that one se
t of knives (e.g 30) is parallel to 
the longitudinal sheet direction (L) and one set of 

knives (31) is positioned in a direction transverse 
thereto. 
The device according to claim 4,
characterized
 in that said knife guides 
(43, 44) are equidistantly secured to said support frame 

(41). 
The device according to claim 4 or 5,
characterized
 in that said knife guides 
(43, 44) are retained in at least two knife frames (42) 

successively at offset angles, preferably at 90°, in such 
a manner that one set of knives (e.g. 30) is in parallel 

with the longitudinal sheet direction (L) and one set of 
knives (31) is positioned in a direction transverse 

thereto, and that said knife frames (42) are detachably 
connected to said support frame (41). 
The device according to claim 6,
characterized
 in that said knife guides 
(43) are preferably equidistantly secured to said knife 

frame (42) and said knife guides (44) arranged 
respectively opposite thereto are movably disposed, 

preferably on at least two shafts (46).  
 
The device according to claim 6 or 7,
characterized
 in that said knives (30, 31) 
comprise back extensions (34) in the form of a bracket 

which respectively engage into a U-shaped profile (28) 
made, e.g., of polyethylene. 
The device according to any of claims 6 to 8,
characterized
 in that said support frame 
(41) is movable with a controllable lifting/lowering 

drive (60) between an upper stand-by position and a lower 
working position (Figs. 1, 4a, 4b), e.g. along two or 

four vertical guides (62). 
The device according to claim 9,

position there is provided a limitation means which is 

operative near the bottom, e.g. in the form of a support 
frame stop or a time control for the lifting/lowering
