<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a form of ZSM-5 zeolite, processes for its production, processes for its use in the
production or conversion organic compounds and processes for its use as a selective absorbent.ZSM-5 is an MFI-type zeolite, usually an aluminosilicate zeolite, which has been found useful as a catalyst in a
variety of processes for preparing, converting, separating or purifying organic compounds. The earliest ZSM-5 zeolites
were prepared using an organic template in the synthesis mixture which directed the formation of the ZSM-5 structure.
Known ZSM-5 zeolites prepared using an organic template generally have an SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of at least 60 and
frequently considerably greater than 60 (see e.g. US Patent No 4797267). So-called "inorganic" ZSM-5 zeolites, made
in the absence of an organic template, were prepared in the 1980's. Typically these have an SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of
from 20 to about 30 to 40. SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of up to 80 have been reported (e g Zeolites 1989 Vol. 9 363-370).The morphology of ZSM-5 crystals produced using an organic template can vary. For example, Studies in Surface
Science and Catalysis 33, "Synthesis of High Silica Aluminosilicate Zeolites" (Elsevier), Peter A. Jacobs and Johan A.
Martens illustrates ZSM-5 crystals which are large elongated hexagonal prisms, whose corners may be rounded. Crystals
of ZSM-5 zeolite which are agglomerates of smaller, elementary hexagonal crystallites are also illustrated. In the
presence of an extremely high proportion of silica (eg. US Patent No. 4797267), ZSM-5 crystals may be rod shaped
i.e. elongated crystals with substantially parallel sides and blunt ends The morphology of inorganic ZSM-5 crystals
tends, according to Zeolites (ibid), to be ellipsoidal.There is evidence to suggest that inorganic ZSM-5 zeolite and ZSM-5 zeolites produced by organic templated
synthesis differ in terms of the relative positions of atoms in their structures. In templated synthesis, there is evidence
for occurrence of aluminium zoning (see e.g. Jacobs and Martens, ibid). In inorganic ZSM-5 it is believed that the Al
atoms are homogeneously distributed over the T-atom sites. NMR spectra of ZSM-5 zeolites prepared using an organic
template, specifically 29Si NMR spectra, show two peaks: one at -111 ppm corresponding to Si with no Al neighbours,
and one at -105 ppm corresponding to Si with one Al atom as a nearest neighbour in a T-atom site.The applicants have now identified a novel form of ZSM-5 zeolite. The zeolites of the present invention
