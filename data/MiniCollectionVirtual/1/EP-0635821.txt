<ABSTRACT>
A process for the fabrication of thin film magnetic heads is 
provided that allows better stud adhesion and eliminates the 

problem of corrosive elements building up along the pole tip. 
The process further allows to build up a stud that is 
mechanically more stable against bonding pressure and less 

thermal stress is created during the overcoat process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a process for the 
fabrication of thin film magnetic heads, and especially with a 
new stud design for such heads. The current process for thin film magnetic heads can roughly 
be separated into four different sections: 
1. The construction of the first magnetic pole (P1), 2. The conductor coil, 3. The construction of the second magnetic pole (P2) and 4. The construction of the electrical conductors (studs). In thin film head production relatively large conductors are 
used to make electrical contact between the modules and the 
magnetic heads. Their construction serve totally different tasks, e.g.: 
(i) mechanical stability, (ii) chemical stability and (iii) low contact resistivity. In the past, different types of studs in terms of shape, 
process and metal combination have been used. So after the 
completion of the pole tip P2, a thick copper stud of about 
30 - 50 µm was plated. This thickness was due to the 
sputtering of a thick aluminum oxide layer (overcoat) to 
compensate differences in topography. The surface was 
planarized by lapping the pads with a metal plate. Different 
kinds of problems occurred during the production. First, due 
to the metal combination used (Cu plate/NiFe sputter/NiFe 
plate/Cu sputter /Cu plate/NiFe sputter/Au plate) six 
interfaces were created which could get contaminated during 
the process, thus leading to stud adhesion failure.  Second, the alumina overcoat was chemically etched due to the 
used photoresist (RISTON®) which creates capillaries along the 
thin film head. The gold plating solution, in turn, etched 
holes into the overcoat. These voids appeared along the 
poletip structure at the air bearing surface. Third, by using 
the same structure of full Gold studs the next generation of 
Gold plating solution contained Thallium as a grain refiner. 
This, however, resulted in segragation of Thallium at the 
NiFe/Au interface leading to stud adhesion failure (stud 
pullouts). Furthermore, if the second photolithography mask to plate Au 
was smaller than the plated Cu stud, corrosion may occur if 
cupper is exposed. As already mentioned above, after the second pole tip was 
formed, a copper seed layer was deposited for copper stud 
plating. If the copper seed was sputter etched away, 
redeposition of Cu along the pole tip occured, which formed a 
corrosive element during slider lapping. In addition, the deposition of the alumina overcoat is a long-time 
process of up to about 16 hours. The wafers were 
thermally stressed due
