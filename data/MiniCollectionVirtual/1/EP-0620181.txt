<ABSTRACT>
A jack, particularly to be used for lifting motor 
vehicles, which comprises a jack body made of sheet metal 

which includes a plurality of arms (2,3,4,5), made of sheet 
metal, which are mutually engaged in an articulated manner 

and can be actuated so as to open and close by virtue of a 
screw-like element (10) which is generally engaged with the 

jack body, one arm (5) being rigidly coupled to a first 
substantially plate-like supporting element (12) for resting 

on the ground, another arm (2) being rigidly coupled to a 
second block-like supporting element (15) which can engage 

the lower surface of the floor pan of the motor vehicle. 
Actuation means (11) are provided to produce the reversible 

rotation of the screw-like element (10). A reduction unit 
(16) is included between the actuation means (11) and one 

end of the screw-like element (10) and is suitable to 
reduce, according to a preset reduction ratio, the actuation 

transmission between the actuation means (11) and the screw-like 
element (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compact jack, 
particularly to be used for lifting motor vehicles. Many jacks to be used for lifting motor vehicles are 
already commercially available; however, they are not free 
from drawbacks. One of these is the lack of compactness and solidity of 
the jack. The aim of the invention is to substantially eliminate 
this drawback by providing a jack which is extremely compact 
and at the same time sturdy and reliable in operation. Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present 
invention is to provide a compact jack in which actuation is 
facilitated, in that it can be opened and closed, while the 
weight of the vehicle bears on it, with a minimal effort and 
which, at the same time, ensures a condition of perfect 
stability and balance of the lifted motor vehicle, during 
both lifting and lowering. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
compact jack which can be easily adapted for automatic 
actuation. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
jack which is extremely competitive from a purely economical 
point of view. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
jack which can be easily manufactured starting from 
commonly commercially available elements and materials. According to the present invention, the above aim and 
objects and others which will become apparent hereinafter 
are achieved by a jack, particularly to be used for lifting  
 
motor vehicles as defined in the appended claims. Further advantages and particularities of the compact 
jack, particularly to be used for lifting motor vehicles, 
according to the present invention, will become apparent 
from the following detailed description of currently 
preferred embodiments thereof, illustrated only by way of 
non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, 
wherein: 
figure 1 is a partially cutout schematic front 
elevation view of a first embodiment of the jack according 
to the invention, in its active or erected position; figure 2 is schematic front elevation view of the jack 
of figure 1 in its inactive or folded position; figure 3 is a front elevation view of the jack of the 
preceding figures in its active position, with an electric 
actuation motor applied thereto; figure 4 is a plan view of the jack of the preceding 
figures in its inactive position; figure 5 is a schematic front view of a second 
embodiment of the jack according to the invention, in its 
active position; figure 6 is a schematic side view of the jack of figure 
5, in its

Jack particularly to be used for lifting motor 
vehicles, which comprises a jack body made of sheet metal 

which includes a plurality of arms, made of sheet metal, 
which are mutually engaged in an articulated manner and can 

be actuated so as to open and close by virtue of a screw-like 
element which is generally engaged with said jack body, 

one of said arms being rigidly coupled to a first 
substantially plate-like supporting element for resting on 

the ground, another one of said arms being rigidly coupled 
to a second block-like supporting element which can engage 

the lower surface of the floor pan of the motor vehicle, 
actuation means being provided to produce the reversible 

rotation of said screw-like element; characterized in that a 
reduction unit is provided between said actuation means and 

the actuation end of said screw-like element and is suitable 
to reduce, according to a preset reduction ratio, the 

actuation transmission between said actuation means and said 
screw-like element. 
Jack according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said reduction unit is a reduction unit of the type with 

gears. 
Jack according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said reduction unit is a reduction unit of the type with a 

toothed belt and toothed sprockets. 
Jack according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said preset reduction ratio is 

substantially 50%. 
Jack according to any one of the preceding claims, 
 

characterized in that said arm is rigidly rotationally 
coupled to said first substantially plate-like supporting 

element for resting on the ground. 
Jack according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said further arm is rigidly 

rotationally coupled to said block-like supporting element 
which can engage the lower surface of the floor pan of the 

motor vehicle. 
Jack according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that some of said arms are oscillatably 

engaged at their respective ends by virtue of means with a 
reinforced toothed profile which is obtained by folding the 

metallic sheet material of some of said arms at their 
engagement end portions. 
Jack according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the end of said screw-like element 

which is opposite to its end engaged by said actuation means 
is associated with a block and rotatably supported thereby; 

said block being internally threaded and rigidly coupled to 
one of said arms. 
Jack according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said actuation means comprise a manual actuation lever which 

is substantially L-shaped. 
Jack according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said actuation means comprise means with a direct-current 

electric motor which is suitable to be powered by the 
battery of said motor vehicle and can be coupled to said 

reduction unit in a removable manner.
