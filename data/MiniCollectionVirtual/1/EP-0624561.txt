<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for steam hardening (steam curing) shaped bodies based on calcium silicate hydrates, in particular shaped bodies of steam-cured porous concrete in an autoclave, wherein, after a heating-up phase, a constant holding phase with saturated steam atmosphere under a predetermined pressure/temperature condition a predetermined reaction time required for the formation of the calcium silicate hydrates is set and, after the holding phase, a cooling phase is carried out, with pressure pulsation being carried out towards the end of the holding phase to drive out moisture from the shaped bodies.

A process for steam curing shaped bodies based on calcium 
silicate hydrates, in particular shaped bodies of steam-cured 

aerated concrete in an autoclave, wherein after a heating phase 
a constant holding phase is established in a saturated vapour 

atmosphere and under a predetermined pressure/temperature 
condition for¹ a predetermined reaction period, necessary to form 

the calcium silicate hydrates, and after the holding phase a 
cooling phase is operated, characterized in that, towards the end 

of the holding phase, a pressure pulsation is performed to expel 
moisture from the shaped bodies. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that, for 
the pressure pulsation, vapour is repeatedly and briefly released 

until a determined lower pressure is reached, and thereafter heat 
is briefly supplied until the initial pressure has been re-established. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
heat is supplied by introducing superheated vapour. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterized in that a 
heating device arranged in the autoclave is used for the supply 

of heat. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that, before the pulsing, the vapour is 

superheated in the autoclave to a determined temperature level 
while maintaining the pressure of the holding phase and the 

pulsation is performed at this temperature level. 
A process according to Claim 5, characterized in that  
 

superheating is carried out at temperatures between 10 and 40°C, 
in particular between 15 and 30°C, above the saturated vapour 

temperature. 
A process according to Claim 5 and/or 6, characterized in 
that vapour is released in order to keep the pressure constant. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the pulsation is performed using a pressure 

difference of 0.3 to 1.5 bar, in particular 0.4 to 0.6 bar. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the pressure pulsation-is begun at the 

earliest after half, and at the latest after three quarters, of 
the reaction period and is performed until the end of the 

reaction period or holding phase. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that at the same time a slight temperature 

pulsation is performed. 
A process according to Claim 10, characterized in that the 
temperature pulsation is performed using temperature differences 

of between 2 and 10°C, in particular between 3 and 6°C. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the pressure pulsation and/or the 

temperature pulsation are performed using frequencies of between 
30 and 60 times per hour, in particular between 40 and 50 times 

per hour. 
A process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that, for the heating, an evacuation is carried 

out for approximately 1 hour and thereafter heating is carried 
out within approximately 2 hours. 
A process according to Claim 13, characterized in that  
 

curing is carried out using a holding phase, including a 
pulsation phase, of approximately 5 hours. 
A process according to Claim 14, characterized in that 
cooling is carried out within approximately 1 hour.
