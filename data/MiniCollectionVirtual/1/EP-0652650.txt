<ABSTRACT>
A CDMA communications method capable of 
multiplex transmission of data over a wide range 

from a low rate to high rate such as image data 
without a considerable increase in a circuit scale. 

A fundamental transmission rate is determined, for 
example, at 32 kbps, a rate higher than 8 kbps 

conventionally used. The data whose transmission 
rate is equal to the fundamental transmission rate 

is transmitted in frames including no vacant 
portion. Data whose transmission rate is lower than 

the fundamental transmission rate (16 kbps, for 
example) are transmitted in f
rames including vacant 
portions. The vacant portions are not transmitted. 

This makes it possible to receive data through other 
channels during a time period associated with the 

vacant portions. Data of a higher transmission 
rate, 128 kbps, for example, can be multiplexed and 

transmitted through four channels using different 
spreading codes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a CDMA (Code
Division Multiple Access) communications method and
system preferably applied to mobile communications.Closest prior art is document WO-A-9 315 502 which discloses a method and a system for the arrangement of vocoder data for the masking of transmission channel induced errors.CDMA communication systems carry out a primary
modulation of original data to be transmitted by
QPSK or the like, and a secondary modulation of the
primary modulation signal to enlarge the bandwidth
by a spreading code such as a PN code (Pseudo-Noise
code). The bit rate of the spreading code is called
a chip rate, which is several tens to several
hundreds times higher than the bit rate of the
original data. Each user performs communications
using the same frequency band, and is identified by
a spreading code.Conventional CDMA systems arrange the original
data into frames, perform the primary and secondary
modulations of the frames, and transmit them.
During communications, there are silent intervals,
in which the modulations are stopped, and the
transmission is interrupted. This prevents useless
radio waves from being emitted, thereby suppressing
interference power to other mobile stations. On the
other hand, data whose transmission bit rate is less
than that of voice coded data is transmitted by
making vacant positions in a bit series in a frame,
and stopping modulation of the vacant positions.
The modulation is interrupted in either case. 
However, since the interruption is carried out in a
random manner, the receiving side cannot utilize
this vacant time for other purposes such as
receiving broadcasting information transmitted from
base stations.Data rates of voice codecs for cellular systems
are ranging from 8-16 kbps. Low rate data (e.g.,
1.2-4.8 kbps) as well as facsimile data are also
handled as important cellular services.
Furthermore, it will become necessary in the near
future to transmit signals of the ISDN (Integrated
Service Digital Network) in addition to the low bit
rate data transmission. Image codecs currently
available generally employ transmission rates of 64
kbps or 384 kbps. To achieve flexible transmissions
of low rate data to high rate image data, the
multimedia transmission including images requires
code division multiplexing in the CDMA systems.Figs. 1A - 1C illustrate a code division
multiplexing method when a high rate transmission is
carried out in a conventional CDMA system. Fig. 1A
shows a fundamental channel whose fundamental
transmission rate is fb bps. A
