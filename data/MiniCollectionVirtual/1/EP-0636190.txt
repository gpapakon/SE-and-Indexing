<ABSTRACT>
A spinning installation has a molten mass duct in which the main molten mass stream is supplied to a distribution pump. The distribution pump consists of several partial pumps which subdivide the main stream into partial streams. Each partial stream is supplied to a spinning nozzle. On one of the driven shafts (2) of the pump are mounted mixing elements (12). The main stream is supplied to the pump through a chamber (9) in which said mixing elements (12) are arranged.

Spinning unit for thermoplastic yarns, comprising: 

1.1 a melt line (8), in which the main flow of the melt is 

transported, 
1.2 a distributor pump, which is connected to the melt line 
(8) and in which the main flow is divided into several 

partial flows, the distributor pump consisting of 
several sub-pumps to each of which is delivered a 

partial flow and which are driven by a common drive 
shaft (2), 
1.3 each sub-pump comprising a spinning nozzle, each of 
which receives a partial flow, delivered by one of the 

sub-pumps, for the purpose of spinning one filament 
bundle in each case, 
characterized in that
1.4 before the distributor pump, the main flow is guided 
into a mixing channel (9) and from there is distributed 

to the individual partial flows, each partial flow 
being supplied to one of the sub-pumps, 
1.5 the mixing channel (9) is disposed in alignment with 
one of the driven shafts (2) of the pump and the shaft 

(2) extends within the mixing channel (9), and 
1.6 the shaft (2) in the region of the mixing channel (9) 
and/or the housing of the mixing channel is/are 

provided with mixing elements. 
Spinning unit according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the shaft extending into the mixing channel (9) is the 

drive shaft (2). 
Spinning unit according to Claim 2,
characterized in that
 
the mixing channel (9) is disposed on the side of the 

pump housing which faces away from the drive side, and 
that the end of the drive shaft (2) which faces away 

from the drive side extends into the mixing channel 
(9).  

 
Spinning unit according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that
 
the mixing channel (9) is located in the housing cover 

(11). 
Spinning unit according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 
the mixing channel (9) is flanged to the pump housing, 

preferably, that the distributor pump is flanged to a 
pump block (20) within which the melt line (8) and the 

partial flow lines are guided, and that the mixing 
channel (9) extends, at least in part, within the pump 

block (20). 
Multiple gear pump with several sets of paired gears, 
which are driven by a common drive shaft (2) and each 

form a sub-pump,
 
with an inlet chamber (9) for a main flow,
 
with sub-channels (16) which branch off from the inlet 

chamber (9) and each of which leads to the inlet of one 
set of paired gears, so that the main flow is divided 

into several partial flows,
characterized in that
 
the end of one of the shafts (2) extends into the inlet 

chamber (9) and that the inlet chamber (9) is designed 
as a mixing chamber and the shaft as a mixing shaft 

(12). 
Gear pump according to Claim 6,
characterized in that
 
the mixing shaft is the drive shaft (2).
