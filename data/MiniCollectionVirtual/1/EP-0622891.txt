<ABSTRACT>
A synchronous rectifier for use with a clamped-mode power converter 
uses in one embodiment a hybrid rectifier (105,323) with a MOSFET rectifying 

device (105) active in one first cyclic interval of the conduction/nonconduction 
sequence of the power switch (101) and a second rectifying device embodied in one 

illustrative embodiment as a low voltage bipolar diode rectifying device (323) active 
during an alternative interval to the first conduction/nonconduction interval. The 

gate drive to the MOSFET device (105) is continuous at a constant level for 
substantially all of the second interval (by virtue of 321, 322) which enhances 

efficiency of the rectifier. The bipolar rectifier device (323) may also be embodied 
as a MOSFET device. The subject rectifier may be used in both forward and flyback 

power converters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to switching type power converters and, more particularly, to forward converters having a clamp mode topology.Self synchronized rectifiers refer to rectifiers using MOSFET rectifying devices having control terminals which are driven by voltages of the windings of the power transformer in order to provide the rectification of the output of the transformer. Use of synchronous rectifiers has been limited however by the inefficiency of these rectifiers in buck derived converter topologies. Efficiency is limited due to the nature of switching of buck derived converts (i.e. buck, buck-boost, boost converters including forward and flyback topologies) and due to the variability of the transformer reset voltages in the forward type converters. This is because the rectifying devices do not conduct for the full switching period and the gate drive energy of one of the rectifiers is dissipated.EP-A-0428377 discloses an active clamp converter operating in the flyback mode.EP-A-0618666, which is relevant pursuant to Art. 54(3) EPC, discloses a DC/DC forward converter comprising a power transformer, a synchronous rectifier circuit on the secondary side of the transformer and a clamp circuit on the primary side of the transformer.EP-A-0610158, which is relevant also pursuant to Art 54(3) EPC, discloses a DC/DC fly-back power converter comprising an isolation transformer, clamping means and synchronous rectifiers.According to this invention there is provided a power converter as claimed in claim 1.In the accompanying drawings:-
