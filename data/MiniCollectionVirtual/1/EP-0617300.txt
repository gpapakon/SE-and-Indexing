<ABSTRACT>
Incandescent lamps or arc lamps having an infrared 
red reflecting multilayer optical interference filte
r 
on the outer surface of the vitreous or fused quartz 

lamp envelope enclosing the filament have a light-scattering 
coating applied over the filter to scatter 

light emitted by the lamp and thereby diffuse the 
filament image. The light-scattering coating consists 

of light-scattering particles, such as alumina, 
dispersed in a silica matrix. This coating is formed 

by applying to the filter a silicone solution in which 
is dispersed colloidal silica and light-scattering 

particles and pyrolyzing at high temperature to drive 
off the organic components and form the silica matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric lamp having
an infrared reflecting filter and a light-scattering
coating. More particularly, this invention relates to
a lamp comprising a light-transmissive envelope
enclosing an electric source of light with an infrared
reflecting filter on the envelope and a light-scattering
coating disposed adjacent the filter,
wherein the coating contains light-scattering particles
dispersed in a silica-containing, glassy binder.Electric lamps employing a filament or arc as the
source of light emit light in a pattern in which the
light source is visible, unless the emitted light is
broken up. Means commonly employed to break up a light
source image include a lenticuled lens (with or without
the use of a reflector), sandblasting the lamp
envelope, etching the lamp envelope or coating the lamp
envelope to scatter the emitted light and diffuse the
light source image of the arc or filament. Acid
etching or coating the lamp envelope is most commonly
found in a conventional household type of incandescent
lamp wherein the glass envelope enclosing the filament
is acid etched (frosted) and/or coated with a
particulate, light-diffusing material. A mixture of
clay and silica or titanium dioxide is often used as
the particulate, light-scattering material, because of 
its availability, light-scattering properties, chemical
inertness and ability to withstand the high
temperatures reached during lamp operation.High intensity incandescent lamps used for stage
and studio lighting employ a fused quartz filament or
arc chamber and are sometimes sand-blasted to break up
the emitted light source image so that the light
emitted by the lamp is more diffuse and the light
source is not visible on the object(s) being
illuminated. The fused quartz is able to withstand the
extremely high temperatures often exceeding 900Â°C
reached during lamp operation.More recently high intensity lamps have been
developed having multilayer optical interference
filters disposed on the outer surface of the vitreous
lamp envelope containing the light source within.
These filters are multilayer films or coatings which
are designed to transmit visible light radiation, but
reflect emitted infrared radiation (IR) back to the
filament light source. The reflected IR radiation
increases lamp efficacy by reducing the amount of
electrical energy needed to maintain the desired
filament temperature. Since the amount of visible
light radiation is the same but the amount of
electricity required to produce this radiation is
reduced, the
