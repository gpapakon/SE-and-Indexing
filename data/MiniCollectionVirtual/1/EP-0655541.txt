<ABSTRACT>
A metal profile intended for use in the construction of fixed door frames which are resistant to fire, or fire-barrier doors, which aims to separate two premises to prevent the extension of any fire from one to the other of these premises, which profile includes a first part (1) intended to be installed in one of the premises which have to be separated off, a second part (2) is intended to be installed in the other of the premises to be separated off, this second part (2) including shaped pieces (20-24) capable of forming or receiving the folding (rabbet) of a door, and a third part (3) which connects the first and second parts (1, 2), in which profile these three parts (1, 2, 3) are produced from a single piece of sheet metal, the third part (3) includes at least two series of openings (31-33), arranged in line along the length (L) of the profile, the individual openings of each series of openings being separated from one another by bridges (36-38), and the bridges (37) separating the individual openings (32) of a series of openings being displaced, along the length (L) of the profile, with respect to the bridges (36, 38) separating the individual openings (31, 33) of the one or more adjacent series of openings. Preferably, there are three series of rectangular openings (31-33) in the third connection part (3) of the profile.
