<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to connection elements (2) for light guides made of materials having a high spectral transmission, in particular in the wavelength spectrum of visible light, the connection element (2) consisting of a depression (2a) in the light-guiding member (1b), in each case with congruent trapezoidal cross-sections. The mean widths (5) and the mean heights (6) of the trapezoidal cross-sections preferably differ by a factor of at least 1.5. As light-guiding member, there are furthermore preferred light-guiding plates (boards) which consist preferably of plastic, particularly preferred is polymethyl methacrylate.
