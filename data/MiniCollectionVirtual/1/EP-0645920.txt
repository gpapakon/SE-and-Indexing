<ABSTRACT>
A computer (BAR) or computer system transfers useful data (U1 to Un) and also check data (V1 to Vn) derived therefrom to a data sink (R1, R2). The data sink checks the received useful data using the transmitted check data and also check data extracted by it from the useful data. At specific pre-defined or event-controlled time intervals, the data sink forms a sum check datum (W1.1, W1.2) from all the check data (V1.1 to Vn.1, V1.2 to Vn.2) received in the meantime and transfers this to the data source (BAR). It is compared there with a sum check datum (W1) formed according to the same principles from the check data (V1.1 to V1.n) inserted in the previously transmitted useful data. The use of the method according to the invention requires very little time for the return transmission of check data and therefore imposes a minimal load on the transmission system overall.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the single-channel transmission of
data telegrams from a data source to a data sink, with

check data calculated from the useful data of the data
telegrams being provided at the source end,

characterized in that an aggregate check datum (W1.1,
W1.2) is formed in each case from the check data (V1.1 to

Vn.1, V1.2 to Vn.2), which are communicated to the data
sink (R1, R2) or are determined by the latter, within a

predeterminable period of time, and in that these aggregate
check data are compared in terms of their content

with a respective aggregate check datum (W1), which is
derived at the data source (BAR) from the check data (V1

to Vn) provided there.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized in that the aggregate check data comparison

is carried out in a time- and/or event-controlled manner.
Method according to Claim 2,

characterized in that in a system for outputting safety-critical
commands as required, the execution of such

commands is made dependent inter alia on the determination
of the aggregate check data with subsequent comparison

of the aggregate check data, which determination is
carried out within the framework of the outputting of the

commands.
Method according to Claim 2 or 3,

characterized in that the maximum time interval for the
determination of the aggregate check data and the aggregate

check data comparison is predetermined by the
permissible error disclosure time, which results from the 

MTBF specific to the data transmission system.
Device for the single-channel transmission of
data telegrams from a data source (BAR) to a data sink

(R1, R2)

having a generator at the data source end which generates
the data telegrams which are to be transmitted and

comprise useful data (U1,..., Un) and check data (V1, ...,
Vn) assigned thereto,

characterized in that the data sink (R1, R2) forms,
within a predeterminable period of time, an aggregate

check datum (W1.1, W1.2) in each case from the check data
(V1.1 to Vn.1, V1.2 to Vn.2), communicated to or determined

by the data sink (R1, R2), and communicates the
said aggregate check datum to the data source, and in

that the data source (BAR) compares these aggregate check
data (W1.1, W1.2) in terms of their content with a

respective aggregate check datum (W1), which is derived
in the same way at the data source (BAR) from the check

data (V1 to Vn) which are provided there.
Device according to Claim 5,

characterized in that the data source (BAR) is designed
as a computer with signal protection and the data sink is

designed as a computer without signal protection or a
computer system (R1, R2) without signal protection, and

in that the aggregate check data comparison takes place
in the computer (BAR) with signal protection.
Device according to Claim 5 or 6,

characterized in that both the data source (BAR) and the
data sink (R1, R2) are designed as a computer or computer

system without signal protection, and in that the aggregate
check data comparison takes place in a comparator

with signal protection.
Device for carrying out the method according to
one of Claims 5 to 7,

characterized in that both the data source (BAR) and the
data sink (R1, R2) are designed as a computer or computer 

system without signal protection, and in that the aggregate
check data comparison takes place in the computer or

in at least one of the computers which determine the
aggregate check data at the sink end and in at least one

computer outside this computer.
Device according to one of Claims 5 to 8,

characterized in that telegram multiplication takes place
in the data sink (R1, R2) for subsequent multi-channel

processing of the communicated data, and in that separate
aggregate check data (W1.1, W1.2) are formed from the

multiplied check data (V1.1 to Vn.1, V1.2 to Vn.2) within
the internal processing channels (K1, K2) and are compared

with the aggregate check datum (W1) created at the
source end.
Device according to one of Claims 5 to 9,

characterized in that a comparison of the channel-specific
check data (V1.1, V1.2) for correspondence as regards

content also takes place in addition to the aggregate
check data comparisons in the computer or computers (R1,

R2) at the sink end.
Device according to one of Claims 5 to 10,

characterized in that, at the sink end, an assignment
check of the communicated check data (e.g. V1.1) with

respect to the associated useful data (U1,1) takes place
within the individual computers or computer channels,
Device according to one of Claims 5 to 11,

characterized in that the data telegrams are assigned
sequential numbers whose sequence can be checked at the

sink end.
