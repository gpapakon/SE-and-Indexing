<ABSTRACT>
An expandable intraluminal vascular graft is 
expanded within a blood vessel by an angioplasty balloon 

associated with a catheter to dilate and expand the 
lumen of a blood vessel. The graft may be a wire mesh 

tube or a thin-walled tubular member having a plurality 
of openings formed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an expandable intraluminal graft
or prosthesis, 
for a body passageway, comprising: a
tubular shaped member having first
and second ends and a wall surface
disposed between the first and second
ends, the wall surface being formed
by a plurality of first and second
intersecting elongate members, at
least some of the first elongate members
intersecting with some of the
second elongate members intermediate
the first and second ends of the tubular
shaped member, the tubular shaped
member having a first diameter
which permits intraluminal delivery
of the tubular shaped member into a
body passageway having a lumen, and
the tubular shaped member having a
second expanded diameter which is
determined by the application from
the interior of the tubular shaped
member of a radially, outwardly extending
force, which second diameter
is variable and controlled by the
amount of force applied to the tubular
shaped member, at least some of
the elongate members being deformed
by the radially, outwardly extending
force, to retain the tubular shaped
member with the second expanded diameter,
whereby the tubular shaped
member may be expanded to expand the
lumen of the body passageway and remain
therein. 
and to
an apparatus for implanting an expandable intraluminal
graft or prosthesis according to the preamble of claim 3.Intraluminal endovascular grafting has been demonstrated
by experimentation to present a possible alternative
to conventional vascular surgery. Intraluminal
endovascular grafting involves the percutaneous insertion
into a blood vessel of a tubular prosthetic graft
and its delivery via a catheter to the desired location
within the vascular system. Advantages of this method
over conventional vascular surgery include obviating the 
need for surgically exposing, incising, removing,
replacing, or bypassing the defective blood vessel.In US-A-4553545 a helically shaped spiral spring is disclosed
for application in blood vessels. Those prior art grafts can
generally be classified as self-expanding wires, wherein the
graft, after having delivered to a stenotic site and released,
is subjected to a spring or spring-like force associated with
the construction of such grafts to cause the graft to enlarge
and open outwardly within the body passageway.Some of the
structures which have previously been used as
intraluminal vascular grafts have included coiled
stainless steel springs; helically would coil springs
manufactured from an expandable heat-sensitive material;
and expanding stainless steel

<CLAIMS>
An expandable intraluminal vascular graft or prosthesis (70)
for a body passageway, comprising: a tubular shaped member

(71) having first (72) and second (73) ends and a wall
surface (74) disposed between the first and second ends, the

wall surface (74) being formed by a plurality of first and
second intersecting elongate members (78, 79), at least some

of the first elongate members (78) intersecting with some of
the second elongate members (79) intermediate the first and

second ends of the tubular shaped member (71), the tubular
shaped member (71) having a first diameter (d) which permits

intraluminal delivery of the tubular shaped member into a
body passageway having a lumen, and the tubular shaped

member (71) having a second expanded diameter (d') which is
determined by the application from the interior of the tubular

shaped member (71) of a radially, outwardly extending
force, which second diameter (d') is variable and controlled

by the amount of force applied to the tubular shaped member
(71), at least some of the elongate members (78, 79) being

deformed by the radially, outwardly extending force, to
retain the tubular shaped member (71) with the second expanded

diameter (d'), whereby the tubular shaped member (71)
may be expanded to expand the lumen of the body passageway

and remain therein,
characterized

in that the first and second intersecting elongate members
(78, 79) are a plurality of thin bars, each having a uniform

thin rectangular cross-sectional configuration, wherein each
pair of adjacent first bars (78) is interconnected by at

least two of said second bars (79), each second bar (79)
being formed integral with the respective pair of first bars

(78) and extending only between said pair of first bars (78)
and each second bar (79) extending on the circumference of

a circle whose plane is perpendicular to the longitudinal
axis of said tubular shaped member (71). 
The graft or prosthesis of claim 1, wherein the material of
said elongate members (78, 79) comprises tantalum as a main

component.
An apparatus for intraluminally reinforcing or expanding the
lumen of a body passageway, comprising an expandable,

tubular shaped prosthesis or intraluminal vascular graft
(70) according to one of the preceding claims and a catheter

for mounting the prosthesis or graft (70),
characterized

in that the catheter has an expandable, inflatable portion
associated therewith and including means for mounting and

retaining the expandable, tubular shaped prosthesis or
intraluminal vascular graft (70) on the expandable,

inflatable portion, whereby upon inflation of the

expandable, inflatable portion of the catheter, the
prosthesis (70) is forced radially outwardly into contact

with the body passageway to remain therein, and the
expansion of the prosthesis (70) is controlled by the

expansion of the inflatable portion of the catheter.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the mounting and retaining
means comprises retainer ring members disposed on the

catheter adjacent the expandable, inflatable portion and
adjacent each end of the expandable, tubular shaped

prosthesis.
