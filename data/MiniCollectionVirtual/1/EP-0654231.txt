<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing a bristle zone of a toothbrush, formed from a plurality of folded bristle tufts of synthetic bristles, in which the bristle tufts are firstly separated from a bristle stack with a predetermined bristle length, are folded by means of a flat ram and an anchor and are pressed by the latter one after the other into blind bores in the bristle zone of the toothbrush and are firmly anchored there. In order to allow optimum rounding of the bristle ends even in conventional production of the bristle zone - separating, folding and attaching the bristle tufts by means of an anchor - with a profiling of the bristle zone with different bristle lengths and to rule out the fact that the dust occuring during the rounding of the bristles can contact the toothbrush, the bristles are already rounded at both ends before they are folded and anchored.
