<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to isotropic 
polyesters containing repeating units prepared from 
terephthalic acid and/or isophthalic acid and 1,4-butanediol 
and minor amounts of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic 
acid. US-A-4,459,402 discloses copolyesters of 20-80 mol 
% trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid, 80-20 mol % 
terephthalic acid and/or 80-20 mol % 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic 
acid and 100 mol % 1,4-butanediol having 
exceptionally high tensile strength. US-A-4,414,382 
discloses polyesters based on 90-55 mol % 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic 
acid, 10-45 mol % trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic 
acid, and 100 mol % ethylene 
glycol. US-A-4,526,822 discloses a polyester of 
terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol modified with 
10-40 mol % trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid. JP-A-72348/74 discloses blends of 
poly(1,4-butylene terephthalate) and a polyester having 
an aromatic dicarboxylic acid content that has at least 
55 mol % trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic acid. Heretofore, copolyesters prepared from 1,4-butanediol, 
minor amounts of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic 
acid and one other dicarboxylic acid have 
not been known, particularly when the other dicarboxylic 
acid is selected from terephthalic acid, and isophthalic 
acid.  
 The present invention is directed to a copolyester 
having improved thermal stability comprising: 
(A) acid repeating units from 
(1) terephthalic acid and/or isophthalic 
acid, (2) greater than 0 but less than 20 mol 
% of trans-4,4'-stilbenedicarboxylic 
acid (SDA), and (3) 0 to 10 mol % of other aromatic 
dicarboxylic acids,  
wherein the total mol % of repeating 
moieties (1), (2) and (3) is 100 mol %; 
and (B) glycol repeating units from 
(1') 1,4-butanediol, and (2') 0-10 mol % of other glycols having 2 
to 16 carbon atoms, 
wherein the total mol % of repeating 
moieties (1') and (2') is 100 mol %,  
wherein the total mol % of acid repeating units and 
glycol repeating units are each 100 mol %; said 
copolyester having an inherent viscosity greater than 
0.2, determined at 25°C in 25/35/40 (wt./wt./wt.) 
phenol, tetrachloroethane/p-chlorophenol at a 
concentration of 0.1 g/100 mL and a melting point of at 
least 200°C.  
 The copolyesters of the present invention are 
useful in molding plastics, fibers, and films and have 
unexpectedly improved thermal stability in the melt and 
are preferably isotropic. The polyesters of the present 
invention prepared from 1,4-butanediol, and terephthalic 
acid, and/or isophthalic acid have greatly enhanced melt 
stability when
