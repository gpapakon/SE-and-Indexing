<ABSTRACT>
The object is to provide an MSM type semiconductor photodetecting element which utilizes distorted 
superlattice, which has a high-speed response and a small dark currrent. A semiconductor photodetecting element 

in which a photodetecting layer (3) having a distorted superlattice layer of an in-plane 
compression distortion type is 

formed on a semiconductor substrate (1) by an epitaxial deposition method. In this element, portions (grooves 8a and 
8b) where an epitaxial deposition layer is partly removed are formed in the side wall of the semiconductor layer. A 

Schottky electrode (6) is provided on the inner surface of the groove (8a) through a multi-barrier 
structure (5). The 

high-speed response of a semiconductor photodetecting element is improved, and the dark current is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved strained superlattice semiconductor
photodetector having a side contact structure.While PIN type semiconductor photodetectors having pn junctions
have been used in practical applications, Metal-Semiconductor-Metal (MSM)
type semiconductor photodetectors realized by utilizing Schottky junctions
have been attracting researchers' attention.Since an MSM type semiconductor photodetector comprising a pair of
oppositely disposed electrodes on a crystal surface is particularly suited
for use in a highly integrated circuit such as an OEIC (opto-electronic
integrated circuit), a number of studies have been made in this technological
field.While an MSM type semiconductor photodetector has advantages of
having a very small capacity and being structurally simple and therefore
capable of being produced with a reduced number of manufacturing steps, it
has certain technological problems to be solved before it can make a feasible
opto-electronic device, including a relatively large dark current that has
to be reduced and a relatively long rise time of the responding pulse that
needs to be curtailed in order to achieve a fast pulse response.A long rise time of the responding pulse of an MSM type semiconductor
photodetector is attributable to the fact that holes generated as a 
result of optical absorption move rather slowly so that they tend to get to
the cathode considerably long-after the end of light exposure.The use of a strained superlattice has been proposed as means for
accelerating holes in order to eliminate the above identified technological
problems.This proposal is based on the fact that, if a semiconductor photodetector
has a strained superlattice structure, the effective mass of holes
in the strained superlattice layer having intra-planar compressive strains of
the device is reduced along intra-planar directions to enhance the mobility
of holes, when compared with a device having no strained structure.Fig. 4 illustrates a typical MSM type semiconductor photodetector
realized by utilizing a strained superlattice structure.Referring to Fig. 4, a nondoped InP buffer layer 12, a photodetective
layer 13 having a strained superlattice structure and comprising an
InGaAs compressive strain layer and an InGaAs tensile strain layer, a nondoped
InAlAs layer and Ti/Pt/Au electrodes are sequentially laid on a (100)
Fe-doped InP substrate 11.An MSM type semiconductor photodetector having a strained superlattice
structure as shown in Fig. 4 is accompanied by the following problems
