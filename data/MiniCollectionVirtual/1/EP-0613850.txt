<ABSTRACT>
Armature current I
ARM
 is measured at full load and empty load. These two 
values are used to calculate a pre-torque armature current gain (MBIAS) and 

an over-balance correction is included in calculation of an elevator pre-torque 
armature current I
ARM
 to compensate for an erroneous overbalance value for 
providing an armature current I
ARM
 which does not cause rollback or rollforward 
of an elevator hoist motor. 
Samples of elevator car load and armature current I
ARM
 are taken after the 
elevator brake is lifted, with the car at zero velocity, over a number of runs for 

continually recalibrating the pre-torque armature current gain (MBIAS) and 
offset, thereby compensating for any drift in performance of the loadweighing 

system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to elevator rollback and rollforward after 
lifting of a brake and prior to start of a normal run. There are two problems: (a) elevator rollback and rollforward prior to start 
of a normal run and (b) calibration of the loadweighing system. These problems 
relate to operation of the elevator (a) during installation and (b) after installation, 
respectively. Movement of the car prior to being commanded to run at the start of a 
normal run can lengthen the run time because the car must be re-leveled and 
brought to a standstill before going on a run. Unintended movement of the car 
may occur if pre-torque armature current applied to an elevator drive motor is 
incorrect so that the car does not stay still after the brake is lifted. This causes 
passenger discomfort. Armature current is proportional to the load on the car: 
T = KTIARM, (R)(LOAD - OVERBALANCE) = KTIARM, IARM = RKT (LOAD - OVERBALANCE), LOADMAX LOAD = %LOAD, OVERBALANCEMAX LOAD = %OVERBALANCE %LOAD - %OVERBALANCE = LOAD - OVERBALANCEMAX LOAD  
 
   where 
IARMis the armature current; KTis a torque constant; Ris the length of the torque arm; LWis the load weight, the force tangent to the sheave which may be expressed 
as %LOAD (the weight in the car as a percentage of full load) minus 
%OVERBALANCE; and Tis the torque. The two problems are as follows: 
(1) At installation, the drive must be adjusted to provide an armature 
current during pre-torque (bias current) to keep the car from moving when the 
brake is lifted prior to a run. A parameter MBIAS scales bias torque based on 
the overbalance, in the car (that is, when the car is carrying full load, the motor 
is carrying full load minus the overbalance); the overbalance is the portion of 
the counterweight greater than the weight of the car (%OVERBALANCE). The 
drive receives loadweighing information from the car controller, formatted as a 
percentage offset from the weight of a balanced car; thus, empty car load is zero 
minus overbalance. Thus, MBIAS and %OVERBALANCE must be properly 
adjusted at installation to give accurate pre-torque armature currents. A method 
to quickly and accurately set these parameters is needed. Presently, these 
numbers are entered from a table, with MBIAS being adjusted in an imprecise 
manner at installation to give approximately the right pre-torque value, usually 
based on load in the car. 
MBIAS * (%LOAD - %OVERBALANCE) = IARMMBIAS * (LOAD - OVERBALANCE)MAX LOAD = IARM 
so 
MBIASMAX LOAD = RKT,  
so 
MBIAS = R(MAX LOAD)KT ,
