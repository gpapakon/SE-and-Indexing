<ABSTRACT>
The central adjuster exhibits a stationary basic body (1), on whose one side the belt band (2), which is to be fixed, runs in and on whose opposite side a free belt band-end (2 e) runs out. A clamping device (10 a, b) is provided within the basic body (1). The belt band (2) is guided, within the basic body, over two rollers (3 a, b), with two changes of direction. The clamping device is arranged between the rollers. The rollers (3 a, b) are mounted on the basic body (1) such that they can move to a limited extent, and their distance is fixed by an operating part (6) which is likewise fixed on the basic body such that it can be displaced to a limited extent. Between basic body (1) and operating part (6), a spring force (8) acts such that the central adjuster moves automatically into the clamping position.

A device for the adjustable fastening of a belt strap (2) with a base body (1) for the
stationary mounting and on whose one side the belt strap (2a) to be fastened runs in and whose

opposite side distant from this a free belt strap end (2a) runs out, and with a clamping means
(10a, 11, 10b) arranged within the base body (1) for fastening the belt strap, characterised in


that within the base body (1) two rollers (3a, 3b) in each case turning the belt strap (2)
about approximately 180Â° are mounted rotatably, mounted displaceably in a limited manner in

the pass through direction (4) of the belt strap (2) and mounted at a constant distance to one
another,
that the clamping means (10a, 11, 10b) is arranged in the region between the rollers (3a,
3b) and is provided for the impingement of the part (2c) of the belt strap (2) running between the

rollers,
that the clamping means (10a, 11, 10b) is impinged by the turning force arising at one
roller (3b) and
that at the base body (1) an operating part (6) is displaceably arranged in a limited manner
in the pass through direction (4) of the belt strap (2) and is impinged by spring force for the

automatic fastening of the belt strap (2).
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the clamping means comprises two
clamping bodies (10a, 10b) of which one is arranged rigidly and the other movably in a limited

manner within the base body (1). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the movement
of the movably mounted clamping body (10b) is determined by a connecting link guide (5b) (5b)

in the base body (1).
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the connecting
link guide (5b) in the base body (1) comprises an inclination (12) with regard to the pass through

direction (4) of the belt strap (2).
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the clamping
bodies (10a, 10b) at their sides facing one another are formed step-shaped in a manner such that

in the clamping position the steps (11) engage into one another with the incorporating and
fastening of the belt strap (2).
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the base body in
cross section is formed essentially U-shaped, wherein the guides for the rollers (3a, 3b) and the

clamping bodies (10a, 10b) are formed by corresponding recesses (5a, 5b) in the arms.
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the distance of
the rollers (3a, 3b) is fixed by the operating part (6).
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the operating part
(6) in cross section is formed essentially U-shaped and encompasses the base body (1) on three

sides for forming an essentially closed formation, wherein in the arms of the operating part (6)
recesses, preferably pocket holes, are provided for receiving the free ends of the roller axes (7).
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the free ends of
the movable clamping body (10b) lie pivotingly movable in recesses in the arms of the operating

part (6). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that at the operating
part (6) a handle (13) is provided and that between the operating part (6) and the base body (1)

a helical spring (8) is provided.
