<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a clip for surgical use with the following characteristics: a) the clip consists of a lower (1) and an upper (2) section which b) are interconnected by a flexible bridge (18); c) the lower and upper parts of the clip and the flexible bridge are in a plane of symmetry; d) at the free end (10) of the lower part of the clip there is a pointed pin angled in the plane of symmetry; e) at the free end (12) of the upper part of the clip there is a rounded protective projection; f) which is abutted by an aperture arranged in the plane of symmetry; g) the lengths of the lower part of the clip, including the pin, the upper part of the clip as far as the aperture and the flexible bridge are such that the point of the pin penetrates the aperture when the upper part of the clip is pressed towards the lower part, with deformation of the flexible bridge. A clip applicator for fitting this clip is also proposed.

Clip for surgical use, having the following 
features: 


a) the clip comprises a lower clip portion (1) and an 
upper clip portion (2), which portions 
b) are interconnected by a flexible bridge member (8); 
c) the lower clip portion (1), the upper clip portion 
(2) and the flexible bridge member (8) lie in a plane of 

symmetry; 
d) the lower clip portion (1) carries, at its free 
end, a pin (9) which is bent-over in the plane of symmetry 

and is provided with a point (10); 
e) the upper clip portion (2) carries, at its free 
end, a rounded protective projection member (12), 
f) which communicates with an opening (11) disposed in 
the plane of symmetry; 
g) the length of the lower clip portion (1), including 
the length of the pin (9), the length of the upper clip 

portion (2) as far as the opening (11), and the length of 
the flexible bridge member (8) are selected so that the 

point (10) of the pin (9) is insertable into the opening 
(11) as a result of bending the upper clip portion (2) 

whilst deforming the flexible bridge member (8) in a 
direction towards the lower clip portion (1), 
 
characterised by the following features: 


h) the pin (9) tapers towards the point (10), the 
point having a conical or pyramid-shaped configuration; 
i) the length of the flexible bridge member (8) is 
dimensioned so that, for the closure of the clip, it is 

deformable in the plane of symmetry at two different 
locations at an approximate right angle in such a manner 

that the closed clip approximately assumes the shape of a 
rectangle, the sides of which are represented by the  

 
flexible bridge member (8), the lower clip portion (1), the 

pin (9) and the upper clip portion (2). 
Clip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the protective projection member (12) is bent-over into the 

same direction as the pin (9). 
Clip according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the cross-section of the felexible bridge member (8) 

is smaller than the cross-sections of the lower clip 
portion (1) and the upper clip portion (2). 
Clip according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the interfaces between the lower clip portion (1), the 

upper clip portion (2) and the flexible bridge member (8) 
are configured as offset faces (6, 7). 
Clip according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the upper clip portion (2) carries, 

in its region abutting against the flexible bridge member 
(8), two pins (3) which are symmetrically disposed 

perpendicular to the plane of symmetry. 
Clip applicator having a clip according to one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterised by 


a) a clip gripping device (27) for gripping and 
retaining the flexible bridge m
ember (8) of the clip; 
b) an applicator shank tube (39), which is 
displaceable, via an operating handle (13, 14), axially and 

perpendicularly to the retained, flexible bridge member (8) 
of the clip, and the head (38) of which tube deforms the 

clip in the event of distal advancement in the region of 
the flexible bridge member (8) in such a manner that the 

lower clip portion (1) and the upper clip portion (2) 
assume an approximately parallel position, the point (10) 

of the pin (9) piercing the opening (11);  
 
c) two opening pins (47) in the applicator head (38) 
and one stop rod (28) in the clip gripping device (27), by 

means of which component parts the upper clip portion (2) 
can be brought into an approximately perpendicular position 

relative to the lower clip portion (1) by deforming the 
flexible bridge member (8) in the event of a proximal 

movement of the applicator shank tube (39).
