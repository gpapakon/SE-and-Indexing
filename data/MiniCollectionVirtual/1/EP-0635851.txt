of a wire insulating line until a desired outside diameter 

of an insulated wire is obtained. A startup control 
apparatus according to the invention comprises an extruder (1) 

for supplying an insulating material around a core 
conductor (2), a take-up device (4) for taking up the insulated 

wire, a diameter measuring device (6) for measuring an outside

wire diameter D is equal to or greater than a target wire 
diameter D₀, followed by a second correction in which a 

demanded extruder speed EX' is increased by a predetermined 
increment ΔE

 only if a target extruder speed x obtained by 
multiplying the increased demanded take-up speed CA' by the 

target speed ratio r is greater than the demanded extruder 
speed EX'.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the manufacture of an insulated 
electric wire having a uniform outside diameter in a wire 
insulating line where an extruder extrudes an insulating 
material around a core comprising at least one conductor and 
a take-up device takes up a finished insulated wire. More 
particularly, the invention relates to methods of and 
apparatus for controlling an outside diameter of the 
insulated wire during a transitional period upon every 
startup of the wire insulating line. In a wire insulating line, major factors that determine 
the outside diameter of an insulated wire comprising at 
least one core conductor of a uniform diameter are extruder 
speed and wire take-up speed. When the extruder speed is 
increased or the take-up speed is reduced, the amount of 
insulating material supplied per unit length of the core 
conductor increases, resulting in an increase in the outside 
diameter of the finished insulated wire. Contrary to this, 
when the extruder speed is reduced or the take-up speed is  
 
increased, the amount of insulating material supplied per 
unit length of the core conductor decreases, resulting in an 
reduction in the outside diameter of the finished insulated 
wire. In one known arrangement, a diameter measuring device 
continuously monitors the outside diameter of the finished 
insulated wire and measurement results are fed back for 
controlling either the extruder speed or the take-up speed 
so that the insulating layer is formed to a desired outside 
diameter. This arrangement, however, is effective only after both 
the extruder and take-up device have reached steady-state 
running conditions. During a transitional period, or a 
period after the extruder and take-up device have been 
started up until they are stabilized enough to provide 
stable operation, difficulty would be found in controlling 
the outside diameter of the finished insulated wire. This 
is because optimum balance between the extruder speed and 
take-up speed in the transitional period is affected by a 
variety of factors such as operational characteristics of 
the extruder and take-up device, properties of the 
insulating material, diameter and type of the core conductor 
and desired thickness of the insulating layer. Particularly 
because the extruder has a structure in which a rotating 
screw pushes out a gelatinized insulating material around  
 
the core conductor, it is not certain that the actual 
extrusion rate is in perfect proportion with the revolving 
speed of a motor that drives the
