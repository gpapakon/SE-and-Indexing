<ABSTRACT>
A box having a base and a vertical side wall (14) which bounds a box opening which can be closed by the cover (2). One of the cover and side wall box parts is provided along its circumference with a pair of flanges (4,6;6a,6b) which extend on both sides along the edge of one box part in order to accommodate the edge of the other box part in between. At least one of the mutually facing sides, which overlap one another when the box is closed, of the flanges (4,6;6a,6b) and of the other box part is provided with a coating (8;8a;8b,8c;8d) made of elastic material which is more flexible than the material of the flange or of the other box part on which it is arranged. The coating (8;8a;8b,8c;8d) is compressed between a flange on the other box part when the box is closed.

A box for use in an electrical installation, which has a bottom (12) and a 
perpendicular side wall (14) defining a box opening which can be closed off by a 

cover (2), one of the cover and side wall box portions being provided along its 
periphery with a pair of flanges (4, 6; 6a, 6b) which are closed in themselves and 

which extend along the entire edge of the one box portion and which are provided to 
extend on both sides along the other box portion for the purposes of receiving 

therebetween the edge of the other box portion, characterised in that at least one of 
the mutually facing sides, which are in overlapping relationship when the box is 

closed, of the flanges (4, 6; 6a, 6b) and the other box portion is provided with a 
covering (8; 8a; 8b, 8c; 8d) of elastic material which is more flexible than the 

material of the flange or the other box portion, on which it is arranged and when the 
box is closed compressed between a flange and the other box portion. 
An installation box according to claim 1, characterised in that the covering 
(8; 8a; 8b, 8c; 8d) is of a profile which increases and decreases in thicknes
s, as 
viewed in the transverse direction of the flanges (4, 6; 6a, 6b). 
An installation box according to claim 2, characterised in that the increase 
and decrease in the thickness of the covering (8; 8d) is substantially linear. 
An installation box according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that one 
of the flanges (6; 6a) of the pair is wider than the other flange (4; 6b), the covering 

(8; 8d) being arranged at the narrowest flange or at the side of the other box portion, 
which faces the narrowest flange. 
An installation box according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
between the flanges (4, 6; 6a, 6b) at the location of the connection between the base 

portions thereof a slot (9) is provided in said connection.  
 
An installation box according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the covering (8; 8a; 8b, 8c; 8d) consists of a thermoplastic rubber. 
An installation box according to claim 6, characterised in that the covering 
(8; 8a; 8b, 8c; 8d) comprises styrene-ethylene-butene-styrene. 
An installation box according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that 
the box is made from a thermoplastic material. 
An installation box according to claim 8, characterised in that the box is 
made from a mixture of polypropylene and magnesium silicate. 
An installation box according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that 
the one box portion is provided at the periphery thereof with a number of elastic ears 

(10) which are to be bent out in the surface of the one box portion and which are 
adapted when the cover (2) is arranged on the box to hook fast behind associated 

projections (16) arranged on the outside of the other box portion, for locking the 
cover (2) to the box. 
An installation box according to any of claims 1 to 10, characterised in 
that the one box portion is formed by the cover (2) and the other box portion is 

formed by the side wall (14).
