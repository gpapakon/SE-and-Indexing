<ABSTRACT>
Certain poly(lactic acid) and poly(glycolic 
acid) polymers or copolymers, and certain carbonates, 

lactones, lactates, lactylates, lactides, glycolates, 
glycolylates, and glycolides have been found to 

stabilize thermal-dye-bleach constructions containing a 
dye in association with a thermally-generated-bleaching 

agent. Preferably, the thermally-generatated-bleaching 
agent is a thermal-carbanion-generating agent such as a 

quaternary ammonium salt of a phenylsulfonylacetic acid 
or a thermal-nucleophile-generating agent such as an 

ammonium salt of a phenylsulfonylacetic acid. These 
materials have been found to be particularly effective 

when used in acutance and antihalation systems for 
photothermographic and photographic elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stabilized thermal-dye-bleach 
constructions and in particular, it relates 
to thermal-dye-bleach constructions containing 
poly(lactic acid) and poly(glycolic acid) polymers or 
copolymers, and certain carbonates, lactones, lactates, 
lactylates, lactides, glycolates, glycolylates, and 
glycolides as stabilizers, preferably for use in 
acutance and antihalation systems. Light-sensitive recording materials suffer 
from a phenomenon known as halation which causes 
degradation in the quality of the recorded image. Such 
degradation occurs when a fraction of the imaging light 
which strikes the photosensitive layer is not absorbed, 
but instead passes through to the film base on which 
the photosensitive layer is coated. A portion of the 
light reaching the base may be reflected back to strike 
the photosensitive layer from the underside. Light 
thus reflected may, in some cases, contribute 
significantly to the total exposure of the photosensitive 
layer. Any particulate matter in the photosensitive 
element may also cause light passing through 
the element to be scattered. Scattered light which is 
reflected from the film base will, on its second 
passage through the photosensitive layer, cause 
exposure over an area adjacent to the point of intended 
exposure. This effect leads to reduced image sharpness  
 
and image degradation. Silver-halide based photographic 
materials (including photothermographic 
materials) are prone to this form of image degradation 
since the photosensitive layers contain light-scattering 
particles (see, T. N. James, The Theory of 
the Photographic Process, 4th Edition, Chapter 20, 
MacMillan 1977). In order to improve the image sharpness of 
photographic materials, it is customary to incorporate 
a dye in one or more layers of the material, the 
purpose of which is to absorb light that has been 
scattered within the coating and would otherwise lead 
to reduced image sharpness. To be effective, the 
absorption of this layer must be at the same wavelength 
as the sensitivity of the photosensitive layer. In the case of imaging materials coated on a 
transparent base, a light-absorbing layer is frequently 
coated in a separate backing layer or underlayer on the 
reverse side of the substrate from the photosensitive 
layer. Such a coating, known as an "antihalation 
layer", effectively reduces reflection of any light 
which has passed through the photosensitive layer. A 
similar effect may be achieved by interposing a light-absorbing 
layer between the
