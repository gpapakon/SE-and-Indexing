<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is an ultrasonic transducer (1) with a housing (5) and a low-thickness cylindrical ceramic oscillator (2) with metal electrodes (7, 8) located on each side, and a plastic adaptive layer (3) disposed between the side of the oscillator (2) facing towards the medium to be irradiated and the membrane (6) formed by the bottom of the housing of the ultrasonic transducer (1). The remaining free space in the housing (5) is occupied by a plastic damping layer (4) designed to damp the oscillator (2). The novelty of the invention resides in the fact that the damping layer (4) is made of high-density silicone elastomer with a high proportion of metal oxide, which can be mechanically mixed and attached in place during the gelling phase.

An ultrasonic transducer (1) with a housing (5), a
cylindrical ceramic crystal (2) of small thickness, metal

electrodes (7, 8) disposed on the end surfaces of the
ceramic crystal, and a matching layer (3) of plastic

disposed at the end surface of the ceramic crystal facing
the radiating medium, said matching layer (3) being in

positive and nonpositive contact with the diaphragm (6)
of the ultrasonic transducer, which is formed by the

bottom of the housing, the remainder of the interior
space of the ultrasonic transducer being filled with a

damping layer (4) of plastic, 
characterized in
 that the
damping layer (4) is made of a silicone elastomer with a

high content of metal oxides.

.
An ultrasonic transducer as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in
 that the damping layer (4) can be
applied during the gelation phase of the matching layer

(3).
An ultrasonic transducer as claimed in claim 2, 

characterized in
 that the matching layer (3) and the
damping layer (4) have such a chemical structure and

composition as to exhibit affinity for one another.
An ultrasonic transducer as claimed in claim 2,

characterized in
