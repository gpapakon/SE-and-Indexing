<ABSTRACT>
A base rubber selected from natural rubber and 
diene rubber is blended with, based on 100 parts by 

weight of the base rubber, 0.5 to 5 parts by weight of a 
2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline polymer having a 

primary amine content of not more than 1% by weight, a 
monomer content of not more than 3% by weight and a 

dimer content of at least 30% by weight. The resulting 
rubber composition is vulcanized in contact with a 

reinforcing material such as an organic fiber or a steel 
cord. The rubber article thus obtained and reinforced 

with the reinforcing material is excellent in adhesiveness 
between the rubber and the reinforcing material, 

and further in thermal resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber
article which is reinforced with a reinforcing material
such as an organic fiber cord or a steel cord and can be
used for automobile tires, conveyor belts, hoses and the
like. The invention also relates to the production of
the rubber article and further to a rubber composition
suitable for coating an organic fiber cord as well as to
another rubber composition suitable for coating a steel
cord.Organic fiber cords such as polyester, polyamide
and aramid, or steel cords, particularly plated
steel cords, such as brass-plated ones and zinc-plated
ones are generally and widely used as a reinforcing
material for rubber articles including automobile tires,
conveyor belts, hoses and the like in order to improve
and maintain strength and durability characteristics of
the articles.However, a problem exists in that adhesion of such a cord to a coating
rubber composition is poor. Accordingly there have been adopted some measures
which introduce an adhesive into the rubber/fibre formulation Rubber World,
April 1993, pp. 31-32 and 42-45, discloses a method of pre-treating nylon 6,6
fibers with a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin. Similarly, Rubber World, August
1984, pp. 24-27, discloses a method of incorporating a resorcinolic adhesive into
rubber during processing, in order to secure adhesion to a steel cord. In addition,
Adhesive Age, June 1976, pp. 31-39, reports the use of a
resorcinol/hexamethoxymethyl melamine formulation in the adhesion of brassed
wire cord to rubber. Of the organic fiber cords, polyester fibers are
excellent in thermal resistance and fatigue resistance
as well as in dimensional stability, and rubber tires
formed by using the polyester fibers have such
characteristics as large transverse stiffness and good
steering stability. Thus, the polyester fibers are
widely used in many rubber articles including rubber
tires for automobiles.Although the use of an adhesive increases initial
adhesiveness between the rubber and the polyester
fibers, it causes the polyester cord itself to be
thermally degraded, and further causes the rubber to be
poor in thermal resistance and flex cracking resistance.Alternatively, in order to improve the adhesiveness
between a steel cord and coating rubber comprising
natural rubber or synthetic rubber, a method of
incorporating sulfur and an organic acid cobalt salt
such as cobalt naphthenate into the rubber is disclosed
in NR technology, Vol. 12, part 4, 1981, pp. 77-84.
Although the use of such a rubber composition for
coating the
