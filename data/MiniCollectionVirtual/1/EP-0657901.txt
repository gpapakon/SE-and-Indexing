<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fluid-cooled transformer
comprising an inductive charge coupler which includes a transformer
primary comprising a primary transformer winding and
magnetic permeable material; and an inductive charge receptacle
defined by walls, to removably receive said inductive charge
coupler, said inductive charge receptable including a transformer
secondary which has a secondary transformer winding adjacent
said inductive charge coupler when inserted in said inductive
charge receptacle, and an associated magnetic permeable material.Such a transformer is known from EP-A-0 552 737. Generally, in charging the batteries of automobiles, a
transformer primary inductive charge coupler is inserted
into the transformer secondary inductive charge receptacle
on the automobile, which charges the batteries of
the automobile. The primary inductive charge coupler
supplies ducted cooling air to cool the transformer
secondary for increased performance.In order to reduce air pollution, there is a
modern trend toward electrically powered automobiles.
These electrically powered automobiles have rechargeable
batteries therein. The power of the batteries is used
to propel the automobile and to provide for other power
needs thereof. The design of such a vehicle is a
careful balance between payload, performance, range
between charging, acceleration, and speed. No matter
what the combination of these criteria, there is need to
recharge the batteries periodically so that the automobile
may be taken on another excursion. With fairly
large batteries, there is need to recharge a substantial
amount of power. Since the recharging time when an
automobile is unavailable should be minimized, high
charging rates are desirable. If an ordinary plug is to
be used, the plug must be suited for high power, which
brings about a risk of harm to the operator and/or other 
people in the vicinity from contact with parts of the
electrical supply system.It is, thus, desirable to make a coupling
between the charging station and the automobile which
does not require the direct transfer of electricity. A
magnetic coupling is desirable. In accordance with this
invention, an inductive charge coupler can be manually
handled and inserted in an appropriate inductive charge
receptacle slot in the automobile. The inductive charge
coupler is a transformer primary and contains an appropriate
magnetic core. The inductive charge receptacle
slot contains the transformer secondary winding(s)
together with the rest of the magnetic core. The
transformer
