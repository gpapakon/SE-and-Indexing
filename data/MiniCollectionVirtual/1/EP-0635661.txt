automotive transmission having pressure operated clutch 

(64,68) and brake servos (72,74) for controlling ratio

of shift valves (480,482,484,486,488) in a valve circuit 
that communicates with the servos, a microprocessor for 

developing control signals in response to input variables 
that measure engine torque, engine speed, vehicle speed 

and a driver-actuated range selector, the shift valves 
(480,482,484,486,488) responding to the control signals in 

accordance with a control strategy that effects controlled 
response of the shift valves to meet varying road speed,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic ratio shift
controls for an automatic transmission in an automotive
vehicle driveline.A multiple ratio automotive vehicle transaxle of
known design, such as the transaxle disclosed in U.S.
Patent 4,509,389, comprises a hydrokinetic torque
converter and multiple ratio gearing for establishing
multiple torque ratio torque flow paths between an engine
and axle half shafts of the kind found, for example, in
front-wheel drive vehicle powertrains. The torque
converter has a bladed impeller driven by the engine and a
bladed turbine adapted to be clutched to torque input
elements of the gearing. Such transaxles include fluid
pressure operated clutch and brake servos for controlling
relative motion of planetary gear elements in the
transaxle gearing to establish the multiple torque ratio
flow paths. The clutch and brake servos form a part of a
hydraulic valve system. Examples of such systems are
shown in U.S. Patents 4,633,738 and 4,665,770.Such systems normally include mechanical throttle
valve systems that are actuated by engine carburettor
throttle controls or engine manifold pressure responsive
actuators. They include also timing orifices, separate
regulators for regulating, for example, supply pressure
for clutch servos and shift inhibitors so that the
necessary shift strategy for optimum performance is
achieved hydraulically.The control system of the '738 patent includes a
torque converter clutch for establishing a lock-up
condition to effect a direct drive from the engine to the
converter turbine. The converter clutch, in turn, is
controlled by a by-pass clutch solenoid valve.The valve system of the '738 patent, like other
known prior art valve systems for multiple ratio
transmissions, includes a mechanical governor assembly for
developing a signal that is representative of vehicle speed.US Patent No 4 730 519 discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1 and describes an automatic vehicle
transmission which has frictional clutches and brakes to
change the gear ratio. The clutches and brakes are actuated
by hydraulic servos supplied from a hydraulic circuit.
Electronic control means are provided to control the
hydraulic servos and to insert a time delay between the
delivery of a signal to operate enagagement of one
frictional element and the delivery of the signal to operate
engagement of another frictional element. The time delay is
adjusted according to the antecedent state of the frictional
elements so as to account for the volume of hydraulic oil. Our invention
