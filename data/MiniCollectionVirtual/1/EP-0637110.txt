<ABSTRACT>
Conventional microfabrication techniques in conjunction with the precise growth of 
layers of single crystalline materials by epitaxial growth techniques allow the creation of 

electro-optic microstructures which achieve high reflectivity with only few periods of 
layer pairs. Standard lithographic techniques are utilized to fabricate 

free-standing quantum wells 
which are confined on both sides by air, acrylic resin, or vacuum. The quantum wells are 

fabricated from spatially and compositionally modulated III-V superlattices in which 
alternate layers of the structures are sacrificed by selective etching. The structures are 

patterned such that the quantum wells are suspended between support posts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to semiconductor electro-optic microstructures, and 
more particularly, to a quantum well arrangement wherein an air, acrylic resin, vacuum, 
or other barrier is utilized to achieve high reflectivity. Conventional multi-layer dielectric mirrors are formed of plural layers of materials, 
each such material being characterized by a respective index of refraction n. In mirrors 
which are formed of two materials of refractive indices n₁ and n₂, with thicknesses of d₁ 
and d₂, the reflectivity will, to a significant extent, scale with the difference in the 
refractive indices, i.e., n=n₁-n₂. A significant problem with making reflectivity mirrors from III-V semiconductors is 
that the difference between the respective indices of refraction is not large, and 
accordingly, a large number of pairs of layers is required to achieve a desired reflectivity. 
The problem is particularly difficult for DBR mirrors for long wavelengths, . For 
example, in order to achieve a mirror with maximum R .999 in the InGaAs/InP system, 
some 49 pairs of layers are required. This stems from the fact that in a typical III-V 
system, n₁=3.17 and n₂=3.5. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide an electro-optic microstructure 
wherein a plurality of quantum well structures are confined on both sides by a barrier 
having a highly contrasting index of refraction. It is another object of this invention to provide a semiconductor electro-optic 
microstructure which is characterized by high reflectivity without the need for many 
layer pairs.  It is also an object of this invention to provide a Fabry-Perot optical resonator cavity 
having a linear dimension on the order of the spontaneous emission wavelength of the 
active medium. It is a further object of this invention to provide a laser arrangement having a low 
emission threshold. It is additionally an object of this invention to provide a semiconductor electro-optic 
microstructure which is characterized by high index of refraction contrast ratio and which 
can be fabricated with conventional fabrication techniques. It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a Bragg mirror arrangement 
which achieves high reflectivity using very few layer pairs. It is also another object of this invention to provide a tunable Bragg mirror 
arrangement. The foregoing and other objects are achieved by this invention which provides a 
semiconductor structure having a first layer for forming a first quantum well, and a 
second layer for
