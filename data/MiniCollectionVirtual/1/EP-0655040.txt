<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the field of surface vessels, and in particular the equipment associated with them. Described is a device and method for the emergency emptying of the tanks of oil tankers in the event of damage to the ship, the invention calling for openings in the ship's sides (5) to be linked to hose connectors (15) by flexible double-wall hoses (12) folded between the ship's side and the tanks. The invention also calls for a hose-deployment system (14) with its own power supply and with an inflatable bag (26) connected to the hose by a line (16). Fitted over these openings are hatch covers (7) which can be blown off by explosive charges. After the openings in the ship's sides have been opened in this way, the hoses are deployed into the sea, in the same way as a torpedo is launched, and brought to the surface by inflation of the bags (26) at the ends of the lines (16), where they can easily be recovered and connected up to tanks. All operations in this process are carried out by radio control. The removal of the tanker cargo is carried out mainly by means of compressed air through the double-walled hoses.

Device/Arrangement for the emergency emptying the tanks of tankers in distress 
consisting of openings and hose connections on the ship sides near the tanks through 

which in cases of emergency the commodity being transported, the dangerous liquid, in 
particular crude oil, fuel, chemical, can be evacuated from the tanker in distress,
characterized in
that all tanks (1) in the ship (2) are equipped with compressed gas cylinders (27) and 
interconnected by pipe lines (3) with valves (4) which can be actuated by remote control 

arranged in said interconnecting pipe lines (3) in such a way that a hatch (8) which in the 
normal state is closed watertightly by a cover (7) is arranged preferably below the keel line 

(6) on the sides (5) of the ship at each tank (1), said cover (7) of which possesses an 
unlocking bolt (9) which is remotely controlled by wireless and an eccentrically arranged 

pivot (10), that 
hoses (12) wound onto drums or laid in a zig-zag are arranged in the interior space (11) 
between said tanks (1) and said hatch covers (7), possibly also between said tanks (1) 

themselves, one such hose (12) being permanently connected to each said tank (1) and 
being provided with a coupling device (13) and a hose drive device (14) and an air bag 

(26) at the other hose end (15) and with a handling rope (16) extending parallel to it over 
the whole hose length, that alternatively said handling ropes (16) are wound onto 

separate drums, that all valve drive (17), hatch unlocking (18) and hose and rope drive 
devices (14) are connected to mutually independent energy sources (19) which during 

normal ship operation are kept fully charged by the energy supply system of the ship, that 
a separate coded wireless frequency which is to be used only once is assigned to each 

separate function in said drive devices (14, 17, 18), that a parallel wiring system (20) with 
a central reception station (21) is arranged on board to relay all wireless commands to the 

various drives, that catapult launched boats (22) with winches, pumps, compressors as 
accident and life rafts and inflatable, elastic permanently anchorable pontoon tanks (23) 

which can be ventilated from the top or balloons (24) are provided on the tanker (2). 
Device / Arrangement described in claim 1
characterized in
 
that the tanks are equipped with a heating device, preferably working on an inductive 

basis which generates microwaves by means of high frequency electromagnetic waves, 
said heating devices being operated by means of accumulators or generators.  

 
Device / Arrangement described in claim 1,
characterized in
 
that said valves (4) in the pipe lines (3) interconnecting the tanks and said wirelessly 

controlled unlocking bolts (9) of the hatches (8) being equipped with electromechanical, 
electropneumatic, electrohydraulic and/or pyrotechnic drive and/or detachment devices 

(17), (18). 
Device / Arrangement described in claim 1,
characterized in
 
that said hoses (12) consist of elastic material and are therefore capable of volumetric and 

diametric expansion, are double walled and about 300 metres long. 
Device / Arrangement described in claim 4,
characterized in
 
that the inner hoses of said double walled hoses are provided with wire fabric, braiding 

and/or netting to which a voltage generating microwaves may be applied via suitable 
connections. 
Device / Arrangement described in claim 4,
characterized in
 
that both hose skins of said double walled hoses are provided with a heat 

reflecting/insulating layer on the outside and the inside. 
Device / Arrangement described in claim 1,
characterized in
 
that said handling ropes (16) of said hoses (12) are also about 300 metres long, consist of 

high strength material, preferably nylon, or have the form of thin steel ropes and are 
provided at their end with a projectile (25) driven by a gas cartridge (14) and an air bag 

(26) inflated by wireless control. 
Device / Arrangement described in claim 1,
characterized in
 
that said external energy sources (20) for said valve drive (17) and hatch unlocking 

devices (18) consist of electric accumulators or gas cartridges and that those for said 
hose and handling rope drives (19) consist of gas cartridges and, if the energy is supplied 

by accumulators, all drive devices themselves and wireless signal reception devices in the 
drive devices are connected by a separate wiring network.  

 
Method for emergency emptying of tanks on board tankers in distress at sea, 
consisting in opening the side of the ship near the tanks of the ship and evacuating the 

dangerous liquid, in particular crude oil, fuel, chemical, via a hose connection, by means 
of a arrangement described in claim 1
characterized in
 
that said hatches (8) which are in a correspondingly favourable position for the purpose 

are opened by means of a wireless signal in that said unlocking bolt (9) is actuated by 
said hatch unlocking device (18), that said hoses (12) with said handling ropes (16) or 

said handling ropes (16) alone are driven into the open sea by said hose drive devices 
(14) and/or by gas cartridges, which are also activated by wireless signal, after the 

opening of the hatches and are thereby unreeled from the drums in the ship, that said air 
bags (26) at said hose and/or handling rope end (15) are filled with gas by a further 

remote wireless command after a sufficiently great distance from the hull of the ship has 
been reached so that the hose ends with said coupling devices (13) or said handling 

ropes (16) alone are transported to the water surface, that said hoses (12) are taken up 
by salvage crews of the auxiliary tanker, a support platform or island or from an auxiliary 

device of any kind by means of said handling ropes (16) and connected to tanks or 
temporary storage facilities such as pontoon tanks (23) or balloons (24) if tanks are not 

immediately available, that said double walled hoses (12) are inflated to the previously 
defined diameter by compressed air entering the outer hose chamber from compressors 

on the salvage units, that by means of a further wireless signal said valves (4) permitting 
optimal emptying of said interconnected tanks (1 ) for the given position of the tanker in 

distress in said pipe lines (3) are opened by means of said valve drive devices (17), that 
by means of the compressors working on board the salvage units compressed air is 

forced through the outer hose chambers of said hoses (12) or alternatively gas is forced 
into the tanks by said compressed gas cylinder (27) at the tank concemed, which in turn 

and in conjunction with three-way valves and pumps of the salvage units cause the tank 

contents to flow through the inner chambers of said hoses (12) into the salvage tanks or 
temporary storage facilities, that during the evacuation process the depth of immersion of 

said hoses (12) is adjusted to suit the state of the sea by adjusting the ratio between the 
weight of the hose inner chamber through which the tank contents flow and the buoyancy 

of the hose outer chamber which is filled with the compressed air flowing through it.
