<ABSTRACT>
A reproducing apparatus of the present invention 
comprises an apparatus for reproducing a magnetic 

recording pattern, in which pattern, tracks are recorded 
by recording heads (REC
A1
, REC
A2
, REC
B1
, REC
B2
) of at least two 
kinds of azimuth angles so as to be alternately disposed, 

said magnetic recording pattern being recorded so as to 
include a plurality of adjacent tracks recorded as one 

recorded unit. The apparatus includes a set of 
reproducing heads (PBa and PBb) equal in number to the 

number of tracks of said one recorded unit. The centre 
of each of the reproducing heads (PBa, PBb) located at 

opposite ends of the set of reproducing heads is shifted 
to a position towards a centre line of the set of 

reproducing heads with respect to a centre line of a 
corresponding one of said number of tracks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
recording reproducing apparatus for reproducing signals
from a magnetic tape which has been recorded and edited
by a magnetic recording apparatus for recording video
signals and audio signals onto the magnetic tape and
having editing function of performing assemble editing
and insert editing on the magnetic tape having signals
previously recorded thereon.In recent years, the D-1 format and D-2 format
are standardized by the SMPTE for digital VTR's free from
degradation in picture quality and audio quality caused by
dubbing. Further, high definition VTR's for recording
high-resolution television signals have also been put into
practical use. In these digital VTR's and high definition
VTR's, a very large number of amount of information must
be recorded and high recording density is demanded from
the viewpoint of tape consumption, resulting in narrower
track pitches (such as 39.1 µm in D-2).In conventional analog VTR's for broadcast
requiring editing function such as VTR's of M2 format or
C2 format, it is important to secure the reliability of 
editing points and a guard is provided between helical
tracks. Further, in digital VTR's of D-2 format (as
described in "Design Consideration for the D-2 NTSC
Composite DVTR" by Richard Brush, SMPTE journal, March
1988), disturbance caused by adjacent tracks is reduced by
using a combination of azimuth recording and the Miller2
channel code. This reduction of disturbance caused by
adjacent tracks is owing to the fact that high-frequency
components are attenuated by the azimuth effect for
crosstalk signals from adjacent tracks and the low
frequency energy contained in signals so recorded by means
of Miller2 channel codes as to limit the run length
range to 3 data bit cells or less is very little. From
these facts, the above described paper says that drift off
track of a head by as much as ±20 µm or less is in a
range wherein correction using an ECC (error-correction
coding system) can be performed.However, this is nothing but a margin for
disagreement between a recorded track and the locus of a
reproducing head caused when normally recorded tape is
reproduced by another machine. As well known, track
linearities of VTR's differ somewhat with apparatuses.
Further, expansion and contraction of tape and/or a servo
tracking deviation may be caused with changes in environment.
As a result of deviation between a recorded track
and the trajectory of a recording head at the time of
editing generated by these factors, partial residue
