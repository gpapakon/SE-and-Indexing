<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device making it possible to measure the intensity of the light scattered by thin films of colloidal media. It is more particularly intended for submicron particle-size distribution analysis by photon correlation, and comprises a device for measuring the intensity of the light scattered by the thin films (16) of colloidal media, comprising:     - a monochromatic light source (2); - a convergent optical system (4) focusing the said light source onto the said thin film to be analysed; - at least one photosensitive detector (5; 5', 5'', 5''') reacting to the light scattered or back-scattered by the thin film; - means (60, 70) for (electronic) processing of the signal originating from the photodetector(s) (5).   According to the invention, the optical system comprises a dioptric element (9) placed on the path of the said light beam, one of the faces (12) of which element constitutes a first wall delimiting the said thin film, the second wall delimiting the thin film with regard to its thickness is constituted by the lower face of a means (20) capable of absorbing all or part of the intensity transmitted by the said thin film. The device according to the invention furthermore comprises a means (14) intended to position the said means (20) in front of the face (12) of the dioptric element (9), that is to say intended to control the thickness of the thin film to be analysed in order to achieve suitable operating points.

Device for measuring the intensity of the light
scattered by thin films (16) of colloidal media

comprising:

a monochromatic light source (2),
a converging optical system (4) focusing said source on
said thin film to be analysed,
at least one photosensitive detector (5; 5'; 5''; 5''')
reacting to the light scattered or back-scattered by the

thin film,
means (60, 70) for (electronic) processing of the
signal coming from the photodetector(s) (5),

characterised in that the optical system (4) comprises a
dioptric element (9) placed in the path of said light

beam and one of the faces (12) of which constitutes a

first wall delimiting said thin film, in that the second
wall delimiting the thin film in its thickness is

constituted by the lower face of a means (20) capable of
absorbing all or part of the intensity transmitted by

said thin film, and in that it additionally comprises a
means (14) designed to position said means (20) opposite

the face wall (12) of the dioptric element (9), i.e.
designed to control the thickness of the thin film to be

analysed in order to reach the appropriate working
points. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the dioptric element comprises a secant face (11)

oriented such that it reflects the beam coming from said
light source so that the beam passes through the thin

film (16) perpendicularly to said face wall (12).
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that a
photodetector (5) is placed on an axis perpendicular to

said secant face (11) of the dioptric element (9) such
that it observes a zone surrounding the focusing point of

said source in which the scattered luminous intensity is
generated.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the dioptric element (9) is a

prism.
Device according to claim 4, characterised in that
the light source (2) and the prism (9) are mutually

disposed such that said source (2) enters the prism (9)
through its face (12) in contact with the film to be

analysed (back-scattered mode).
Device according to claim.5, characterised in that a
photodetector (5') is centred on the axis of the beam

reflected by the secant face (11) downstream of said thin 
film (16) and of a diaphragm (21) such that it operates

in transmitted intensity analysis mode.
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that on its face delimiting the second

wall of the thin film, the means (20) is provided with an
element (15) absorbing the incident beam and designed to

limit the reflected luminous intensity.
Device according to any one of claims 4 to 7,
characterised in that said light source (2) and the prism

(9) are mutually disposed such that said source passes
through the thin film to be analysed (forward scattered

intensity analysis mode).
Device according to claim 8, characterised in that
it additionally comprises a photodetector (5'') which is

disposed on the axis of the transmitted beam and receives
a diffracted light signal.
Device according to any one of claims 8 or 9,
characterised in that it additionally comprises a

photodetector (5''') positioned on the axis of the
transmitted beam and designed to analyse the intensity

transmitted by the sample to be analysed. 
Device according to any one of claims 4 to 10,
characterised in that the face (12) of the prism in

contact with the thin film is hollowed in order to be
used as a vessel for receiving the sample to be analysed.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the lower face of the positioning

means (14) is convex so as to produce a point contact
with the first wall delimiting the thin film.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it additionally comprises a means

allowing it to be operated at high temperatures and/or
high pressures.
Use of the device according to any one of the
preceding claims for measuring the grain size

light scattering, and the optical density or turbidity.
Use according to claim 14, characterised in that the
