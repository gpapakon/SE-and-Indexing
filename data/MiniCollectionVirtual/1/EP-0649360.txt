<ABSTRACT>
A camming member (50) for power tongs, comprising a ring-shaped body (52) including a central opening (54) formed therein, the body (50) being rotatable about a point (10) within the central opening. A slot (57) in the drive member (53) being alignable with a slot (56) in the body (52). The drive member (53) is rotatable independently of the body (52). A detent and stop mechanism (63) is provided for allowing the body (52) and the drive member (53) to partially rotate relative to one another to a desired engaged position and then to maintain the engaged position as the camming member rotates. The body has a first cam surface (79) curving inward toward the point (10), and a second cam surface (80) curving inward toward the point. At least a portion of the second cam surface (80) being axially aligned with and offset from the first cam surface (79).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices gown as "power tongs" which grip
and rotate tubular members, such as drill pipe. More particularly, this invention
relates to ring gear camming members contained within power tongs, which urge
gripping jaws into contact with pipes.Power tongs have been in existence for many years, and are generally
employed in the oil and gas industry to grip and rotate tubular members, such as
drill pipe. It is necessary to grip drill pipe with high compressive forces while
applying a high degree of torque in order to break apart or tighten threaded pipe
connections. In most cases, power tong designs employ a cam mechanism for
converting a portion of the torque into a gripping (compressive) force normal to the
pipe. This conversion is often accomplished utilizing a power driven ring gear
having an interior cam surface. A cam follower (roller) on a jaw member rides
upon the cam surface. As the ring gear is rotated, the follower (and thus the jaw
member) is urged into contact with the pipe. An example of such an arrangement
can be seen in U.S. Patent Number 4,404,876.Most current power tong designs include a ring gear camming member with
an open slot or throat, through which the drill pipe is passed in order to place the
power tong in position around the pipe. Some tong designs employ a ring gear
camming member which has no open throat and is thus a solid circular member.
However, a power tong with a solid ring gear camming member must be employed
by passing it over the end of a pipe, since there is no open throat to facilitate
installation. A power tong with a solid ring gear must be left in place around the
pipe until conditions permit removal by sliding the tong off one end of the pipe.Due to the tremendous forces generated during use, open throat power tongs
must resist spreading during use. Prior art open throat tongs employ heavy duty
rollers and other support structure to resist spreading. Despite such precautions,
prior art tongs often spread and fail during use, resulting in tremendous costs and
down time during expensive drilling operations. While power tongs having solid 
circular camming members do not have the spreading problem, the versatility of
open throat designs is much preferred.Additionally, a particular power tong can only accommodate a relatively
small range of pipe diameters for effective operation due to the sensitive response
characteristics of the cam surfaces of the tong. This condition makes it necessary
to have two or more power tongs available in

<CLAIMS>
A camming member for power tongs, comprising a body (52)
having a central opening (54) formed therein, said body being rotatable

about a point (10) within said central opening, said body further having a
primary cam surface (79) facing said central opening characterised by a

secondary cam surface (80) facing said central opening, at least a portion
of said secondary cam surface being axially aligned with and axially offset

from said primary cam surface and both said cam surfaces (79,80) curving
inwardly towards said point.
A camming member for power tongs according to Claim 1, wherein
said primary cam surface (79) includes an upper portion located above

said secondary cam surface and a lower portion located below said
secondary cam surface (80).
A camming member for power tongs, according to Claim 1 or 2,
wherein the body (52) is ring-shaped and further includes a slot (56)

opening through said body and communicating with said central opening
(54), there is provided a ring-shaped drive member (53) including a

central opening (55) formed therein, said drive member being rotatable
about said point (10), said drive member further including a slot (57), said

slot opening through said drive member and communicating with said
central opening (55) of said drive member, said slot (57), of said drive

member being alignable with said slot (56) of said body (52), said drive
member being slidably mounted on said body such that said drive member

may rotate independently of said body and such that said drive member is
radially supported by said body; and a means (63) is mounted on said

camming member, for allowing said body (52) and said drive member 
(53) to partially rotate relative to one another to a desired engaged position

and then to maintain said engaged position as said camming member
rotates.
A camming member for power tongs according to Claim 3, wherein
said body (52) includes a top portion (58) and a bottom portion (59), said

top and bottom portions being fixedly attached to each other and
cooperatively forming a channel (61), said channel slidably containing said

drive member (53).
A camming member for power tongs according to Claim 3 or 4,
wherein said drive member (53) is provided with an outer periphery

including a plurality of gear teeth (16).
A camming member for power tongs according to Claim 3, 4 or 5,
wherein said means (63) includes:


(i) a detent means (71) for preventing said body (52) and said
drive member (53) from rotating relative to each other when said

slot (57) of said drive member (53) is aligned with said slot (56) of
said body (52) until said body imparts unto said detent means a

threshold resistance to rotation; and
(ii) a stop means (72) for preventing said body (52) and said
drive member (53) from rotating relative to each other after said

body (52) and said drive member (53) have rotated relative to each
other to said desired position.
