<ABSTRACT>
With the starting point in a conventional, rectangular box or carton
packaging for ice-cream, it is disclosed that distinct advantages can be

gained by configuring the lower parts of the corners of the packaging
with an oblique surface (2), so that the corner angles seen from the

inside are increased to more than 90°, while the side and end surfaces
(8,10) of the packaging can otherwise continue to form mutual angles of

90°, whereby it is achieved that the packaging can in a safe manner be
stacked together in pallet-conveyed groups, and without the lower

narrowing inwards resulting in any significant reduction in the contents
volume of the packaging.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a cardboard packaging
of the carton type, especially for ice-cream, and of the
kind where outwardly and upwardly sloping side parts at
the bottom corners create angles which are greater than
orthogonal angles. This shape can easily be achieved by
using carton sides which are so trapezoidal that when in
their raised state they will slope outwards upwardly, in
that the corner edges themselves will also be outwardly
and upwardly sloping, and even more outwardly sloping
than the adjacent wall parts. From the point of view of
application, the shape offers the advantage that material
like ice-cream which can be desired to be "dug up" from
the packaging, e.g. with a spoon, is easier to remove
than from a purely right-angled carton, partly because
there is clearance upwards and partly because it is easier
to reach into the bottom corners.While the sloping walls thus provide advantages from
the point of view of use, on the other hand they entail
problems in handling in connection with stacking and
stowing together. Moreover, when the cartons are packed
with correct orientation, this will result in a reduced
utilisation of space during transport and storage, in
which respect the right-angled packagings will be far
better.The invention is based on the observation that the
aforementioned advantage from the point of view of use is
associated to a special extent precisely with the increased
angle at the bottom corners, i.e. to a higher degree
than to the fact that an obtuse angle is provided
longitudinally with the sides. On this basis, it is disclosed
with the invention that the packaging in general
appears with regular right-angled shape, merely with the
modification that at the bottom corners there is arranged
a triangular part which, from a sloping corner cut-off
line at each corner of the carton's bottom field, extends
obliquely upwards and outwards for angular coverage of 
the respective geometric corners. With such a filling-out
of the corners, there is achieved not only the same but
an even greater increase of the corner angles than is the
case with the known cartons with sloping sides, in that
the corners are made less sharp.In principle, it is without significance for the invention
whether the said corner coverage is arranged internally
in a box-shaped packaging or as an externally-visible
oblique triangular forming of the carton's lower
corner portions. In practice, however, the latter is to
be preferred, and according to the invention this is directly
possible in that the

<CLAIMS>
Packaging of the carton type, especially for ice-cream,
and of the kind where outwardly and upwardly-sloping

side parts at the bottom corners create angles which are
greater than right-angles, characterized in that

the packaging in general appears with regular right-angled
shape, but with the modification that at the bottom corners

there are arranged triangular field parts which from an internal
oblique corner cut-off line at each corner extend

obliquely upwards and outwards for oblique coverage of the
respective geometrical bottom corners.
Carton packaging according to claim 1, characterized
in that the relevant cut-offs are effected by

means of corner parts which are integrated coherently with
the packaging item in such a manner that the oblique cut-off

will be visible both internally and externally.
Carton packaging according to claim 1, characterized
in that the oblique, triangular corner fields

appear locally at the bottom corners, in that the sides of
the carton over these fields meet each other in vertical corner

bend-lines.
Carton packaging according to claim 3, characterized
in that the corner fields, which at their

oblique sides are configured with side flaps for connection
to the adjacent side and end fields of the carton, are extended

upwards in singly-bent flap parts for mutual connection
of the adjacent, vertically-extending, upper side edge

parts of the said side and end fields.
Carton packaging according to claim 4, characterized
in that at the transition between the side

flaps and the oblique sides and said extension, a notch (5)
is provided which enables an integrated configuration of the

oblique corner fields and the extensions which extend vertically
from these fields.
Carton packaging according to claim 3, characterized
in that the oblique corner fields appear under

the lower edge of vertical, downwardly-extending skirt parts
of a cover on the carton.
