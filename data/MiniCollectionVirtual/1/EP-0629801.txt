<ABSTRACT>
There is a gate valve in which a mounting frame 6 for attachment to a wall 1 having an outlet opening 2 is formed and a wall plate 3 has a passage opening 4 associated with the outlet opening 2, in which a gate-valve plate 10 can be moved backwards and forwards in the mounting frame 6 between a closed position in which it covers the passage opening 4 and an open position, and in which, when the gate-valve plate 10 is in the closed position, a sealing ring 18 which can be compressed elastically transversely to the direction of motion of the gate-valve plate, extends along the passage opening 4. The aim is to ensure that the complete, leak-free coverage of the wall outlet opening by means of the gate-valve plate when the latter is in the closed position can be achieved with a reduced outlay and by simpler means. This is achieved by making the passage opening 4 in the wall plate 3 wider than the outlet opening 2 in the wall 1 and arranging the sealing ring 18 in the plane of the wall plate 3 in the passage opening 4, the sealing ring 18 being intended, on the other hand, to rest against the wall edge strip 17 surrounding the outlet opening 2. By means of the transverse movement of the gate-valve plate as it enters the closed position, the gate-valve plate is sealed off directly against the wall, at the wall edge strip.

A slide valve with a seal, 

in which a support frame (6) is formed for application to a wall (1) having an outlet 
opening (2) and is provided on a wall plate (3) with a through aperture (4) associated 

with the outlet opening; 
in which a slide plate (10) can be reciprocated in the support frame (6) between a closed 
position covering the through aperture (4) and an open position by means of a displacement 

device (9) mounted on the support frame; 
in which a sealing ring (18) resiliently compressible transversely to the direction of 
movement of the slide plate (10) extends along the through aperture (4) when the slide 

plate is in the closed position; 
in which the slide plate (10) is pressed into the closed position by means of wedge structures 
(13, 14) with compression of the sealing ring transversely to the direction of 

movement of the slide plate towards the through aperture, and 
in which in the closed position a sealing means (22) is provided for resting against a 
wall-edge strip (17) surrounding the outlet opening (2) of the wall and the sealing ring 

(18) rests against the slide plate (10) on one side, 
characterized in that
the through aperture (4) of the wall plate (3) is widened relative to the outlet opening (2) 
of the wall (1), and 
the sealing ring (18) is independent of the slide plate (10) and is situated in the through 
aperture (4) in the plane of the the wall plate (3), wherein the sealing ring (18) is provided 

on the other side for resting against the wall-edge strip (17) surrounding the outlet 
opening (2). 
A slide valve according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the sealing ring (18) is 
movable transversely in the through aperture (4). 
A slide valve according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the sealing ring (18) ) has a 
metallic support ring (20) which is provided on two mutually opposite sides with one 

annular seal (21, 22) in each case.  
 
A slide valve according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 it is a welded structure 
of VA sheets. 
A slide valve according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the wall 
plate (3) is provided with fastening members (5) which project transversely to the face of 

the plate. 
A slide valve according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 reinforcement ribs (16) are 
provided on the fastening members (5), which project laterally, and on adjoining braces 

(12) of the support frame (6). 
A slide valve according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the slide 
plate (10) is provided with reinforcement ribs (15) which extend over its width and 

which extend through the wedge structures (14) of the slide plate (10). 
A slide valve according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 a radially 
projecting rim of the sealing ring (18) is embraced by a retaining member (19) which is 

screwed onto the wall plate (3). 
A slide valve according to one of Claims 3 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the annular seal 
(22) associated with the wall (1) is offset radially outwards with respect to the annular 

seal (21) associated with the slide plate (10).
