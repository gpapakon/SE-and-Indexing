<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-resistant cast
steel which can be appropriately applied to component parts or
the like for exhaust systems for automobile engines. More
particularly, it relates to a ferritic heat-resistant cast
steel which has excellent machinability, which simultaneously
has good toughness and thermal fatigue resistance and which can
be produced at less expensive production cost, and a process
for producing the same.Recently, vehicle engines, especially automobile engines,
have been improved in terms of combustion in order to fulfill
the low fuel consumption requirement and the environment
friendly requirement. As a result, the temperature of the
exhaust gases tends to increase.Hence, instead of the high-silicon-content nodular
graphite cast iron employed conventionally and widely, ferritic 
heat-resistant cast steel has come to make the component parts,
for the exhaust systems, such as the exhaust manifolds, the
turbine housings of the turbo chargers, the component parts of
the exhaust gas purifying apparatuses and the like. Although
the ferritic heat-resistant cast steel is superior to the high-silicon-content
nodular graphite cast iron in terms of heat
resistance, it is remarkably inferior thereto in terms of
machinability. Accordingly, it pushes up manufacturing cost
and deteriorates productivity. In order to improve the
machinability of steel, it has been known that the addition of
sulfur is effective. For example, as set forth in page 416 of
"STAINLESS STEEL BINRAN (Stainless Steel Handbook in Japan),"
an SUS430F steel containing sulfur in an amount of 0.15% by
weight or more is available as one of ferritic stainless steels
according to JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard).However, when sulfur is added to the conventional ferritic
heat-resistant cast steels, the addition degrades the thermal
fatigue resistance of them. Hence, the content of sulfur has
been limited to as small as the trace amount of inevitable
impurities or less. For example, in SCH1, one of the ferritic
heat-resistant cast steels as per JIS, and the ferritic heat-resistant
cast steels disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (KOKAI) No. 1-159,355 and Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 2-175,841, the sulfur content is 
limited to 0.04% by weight or less. Exceptionally, in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 5-59,498, there is
disclosed a ferritic heat-resistant cast steel whose matrix
includes C in an amount of from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, Si in
an amount of from 1 to
