<DESCRIPTION>
Mammalian steroid 5-α-reductase, an enzyme 
present in mammalian tissues including skin, male 
genitalia, and prostate gland, catalyzes the conversion of 
the steroidal hormone testosterone to the steroidal hormone 
5-dihydrotestosterone (17β-hydroxy-5α-androstan-3-one). 
Testosterone and 5-dihydrotestosterone (5-DHT) are both 
androgenic hormones and they are the primary androgenic 
hormones in males. These steroids are primarily 
responsible for the physical characteristics which 
differentiate males from females. 5-Dihydrotestosterone, 
however, is much more potent than testosterone as an 
androgen and it acts as an end-organ effector in certain 
tissues, particularly in mediating growth. The formation 
of 5-DHT occurs primarily in the target cells themselves as 
a result of the reduction of testosterone by 5-α-reductase. It is known that skin responds to androgens and 
is an active site of androgen metabolism. In particular, 
testosterone is converted to 5-DHT in the skin by the 
action of 5-α-reductase. Testosterone metabolism in the 
skin may at times be abnormally excessive and have 
undesirable effects as a result of the 5-DHT formed. Thus, 
there is considerable evidence that 5-DHT is involved in  
 
the pathogenesis of acne, including acne vulgaris, as well 
as other androgen-associated conditions. Price, et al., 
Archives in Dermatology, 111:1496 (1975). Agents which are 
capable of blocking the formation of 5-DHT from 
testosterone in skin, such as by inhibiting the activity of 
5-α-reductase, would be useful in the treatment of acne. In addition, other physical conditions and 
disease states, including benign prostatic hyperplasia, 
androgenic alopecia (common male pattern baldness), 
seborrhea, and female hirsutism, are also associated with 
elevated androgen activity and could be treated by the 
administration of 5-α-reductase inhibitors. See. e.g., T. 
Liang, et al., Endocrinology, 117:571 (1985); J.R. Brooks, 
et al., Steroids, 47:1 (1976); J.R. Carlin, et al., Journal 
of Chromatography, 427:79 (1988). Agents which are capable 
of blocking the formation of 5-DHT from testosterone by 
inhibiting the effects of 5-α-reductase would, therefore, 
be useful in the treatment of these conditions. One of the many problems associated with the 
identification and isolation of compounds which inhibit the 
effects of 5-α-reductase is the absence of convenient, 
rapid assays which can determine the amount of the enzyme 
present. In the alternative, it would be greatly 
advantageous to have a rapid,
