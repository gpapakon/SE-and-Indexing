<ABSTRACT>
In an optical coupling system for a fiber laser, a cylindrical lens extends parallel to a number of aligned light sources and a series of aligned input ends of optical fibers facing the light sources. Output ends of the fibers pass light to a solid state medium in a laser cavity. A block with precision grooves holds the fibers to align them with the lens and the images of the light sources. The cylindrical lens is biaspheric with a longitudinal axis and two refractive surfaces whose axially transverse cross sections follow paths other than the paths of a conic section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fiber lasers, and particularly to methods
and means for coupling radiation into the core of a fiber laser oscillator or
optical fiber laser amplifier.Fiber lasers are useful in printers to form images by exposing a
medium while scanning it. Such media may, for example, be of the
thermally sensitive type that exhibits a binary response, one requiring that
a threshold level of energy be exceeded for image formation purposes.
Such fiber lasers are often pumped by radiant sources which deliver
radiation to the active material in the fiber's core, which serves as the
lasing cavity. For optimal performance in such devices, it is desirable to
make the most efficient use of available pump power. US-A- 4,815,079 discloses an optical fiber laser in
which radiation is pumped into a single mode core of a laser cavity via a
double clad fiber coupling arrangement. Here, a first multimode layer
surrounds a single mode core, and it, in turn, is surrounded by a second
outermost layer. The multimode layer is a core with respect to the
outermost layer which serves as a cladding. At the same time, the
multimode layer is a cladding with respect to the single mode, innermost,
core. Pump light coupled into the first multimode cladding, either through
its end facet or its side, prcpagates alcng its length, undergoing a
multiplicity of reflections at its core cladding interface, while intersecting
and being absorbed by the innermost ccre to cause lasing action and/or
amplification. In one type of fiber laser the multimode waveguide or
cladding takes the form a rectangular slab that extends along the laser
length.Fiber lasers are usually made fairly long, on the order of thirty
meters or so, with small crcss-sectional geometries to make them easy to
coil into compact configurations and prevent concentration quenching.
However, these qualities, while advantageous for a variety of reasons,
make it extremely difficult to efficiently couple high pump power into them
to promote lasing action, particularly where printing applications demand
high power. Those skilled in the art have addressed the foregoing
problem with more or less success in a variety of ways.For example, US-A- 4,818,062 discloses a fiber laser
with a bundle of waveguides that receive light from a bar of diode laser
elements and couple their outputs into a solid state laser medium through
a lens. While such an arrangement is adequate for solid state lasers
having entrance facets with dimensions of several millimeters, it is more
difficult to
