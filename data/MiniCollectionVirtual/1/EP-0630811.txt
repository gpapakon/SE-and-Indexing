<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a method of shrink film wrapping one or 
more objects (12) in one or more rows. The objects are caused to be 

surrounded by two film webs (1, 4), which are sealed together by means of 
a sealing jaw (14). The objects (12) are moved in towards the two film webs 

(1, 4) by means of a pusher which, on its completion of the infeed 
movement stroke, stretches the two film webs (1, 4) in that the film webs are 

fixedly retained by each one of a hose brake (7, 8). When the sealing jaw 
(14) executes its downward stroke for completely shrouding the films (1, 4) 

around the objects (12), the sealing jaw (14) finally stretches the upper film 
(1). The film (1, 4) projecting outside the objects (12) is shrunk by means of 

hot air nozzles directed towards the objects (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for shrink film
wrapping of one or more objects, in which two film webs - a
first and a second web - are sealed together with the aid of a
sealing device, and in which the objects are fed in towards
the jointly sealed film webs by means of a pusher in one or
more rows, whereafter the film webs are once again sealed
together, severed and caused to surround the objects,
according to claim 1. The present invention also relates to an
apparatus for carrying the method into effect, according to
claim 6.A method common within the packaging industry for arranging
distribution units is to shrink film wrap one or more objects
together into a distribution unit which is appealing to the 
consumer. Hitherto, the shrink film wrapped objects have been
wrapped by one or two film lengths into a loose banderol
which, in a subsequent process, passes a hot air furnace where
the film banderol is inflated by the hot air, whereafter the
film shrinks about the objects. This method has entailed a
relatively large material consumption of film, since the
shrinkage has been difficult to calculate and a relatively
large margin of film must be catered for. Furthermore, the
shrinking operation has entailed that the film has formed
folds and holes in the shrinking process.An apparatus and method for wrapping packages is known from
DE-A-25 48 786, disclosing two film webs which are sealed
together with the aid of a sealing device, wherein the objects
are moved in towards the sealed-together film webs by means of
a pusher in one or more rows, whereafter the film webs are
severed, are once again sealed together and are caused to
surround the objects. Both of the films are fixedly retained
by brakes and prestretched by the movement of the pusher
wherein the first film is retained and finally stretched by
the movement of the sealing device. Here, it is not possible
to wrap packages with packaging materials which entail
artworks or designs since there is no register maintenance for
these patterns. Moreover, there is no shrinking of the
wrapping material.The wish within the art to provide such a shrink film with
some form of printed artwork decor has consequently proved
difficult to realise without distortion. One object of the present invention is to realise a method for
shrink film wrapping in which there is obtained an attractive
and neat distribution package without the above-outlined
problems.A further object of the present invention is to reduce
material consumption and make possible the

<CLAIMS>
A method for shrink film wrapping of one or more objects
(12),

in which two film webs (1, 4) are sealed together with the aid
of a sealing device (14),

in which the objects (12) are moved in towards the sealed-together
film webs (1, 4) by means of a pusher (13) in one or

more rows, whereafter the film webs (1, 4) are severed, are
once again sealed together and are caused to surround the

objects (12),

in which both of the films (1, 4) are fixedly retained by
brakes (7, 8) and prestretched by the movement of the pusher

(13), and

in which the first film (1) is retained and finally stretched
by the movement of the sealing device (14)
,
characterized in that
said brakes (7, 8), said sealing device (14) and said pusher
(13) cooperate synchronously in a predetermined working cycle,
that parts of the films (1, 4) projecting outside the objects
(12) are subjected to thermal action after the wrapping and

sealing procedure and
that a register maintenance (15, 16, 17) adjusts the films (1,
4) into the correct position.
The method as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that

the position of the films (1, 4) is corrected by means of
read-off of an artwork marking on the first film (1) by a

photocell (15), whereupon the second film (4), which is sealed
together with the first film (1), is drawn to the correct

position.
The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that

the second film (4) is drawn into position by being locked by
means of a drive roller (16) against a counter roller (17).
The method as claimed in claim 3,

characterized in that

the drive roller (16) is locked by means of a clutch/brake.
The method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that

the parts of the method are repeated cyclically.
An apparatus for shrink film wrapping of one or more
objects (12), comprising
a sealing device (14) which joins together two film webs
(1, 4),
a pusher (13) for moving in the objects (12) towards the film
webs (1, 4), and
brakes (7, 8) for locking and releasing said film webs (1, 4),
characterized in that
said brakes (7, 8) are hose brakes which consist of an
elongate hollow body which is inflatable and deflatable,
that mechanical connecting means interconnect said brakes (7,
8), said sealing device (14) and said pusher (13) to cooperate

synchronously in a predetermined working cycle,
and that hot air nozzles are provided for heating parts of the
film projecting outside the objects (12) after the wrapping

and sealing procedure.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 6,

characterized in that

the sealing device (14) slopes at an angle of between 5° and
10° from the vertical plane.
The apparatus as claimed in claim 6 or 7,

characterized in that

the apparatus further includes a photocell (15) disposed at
the first film web (1), and a drive roller (16) which may be

locked against a counter roller (17), the drive roller (16)
being disposed at the second film web (4).
