<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for packaging articles is provided comprising a plate member (10) having a plurality of apertures (12a, 12b, 12c) therein. Each aperture has at least two openings and receives an article or group of articles (14, 22, 24) through a first opening. Each aperture has non-return stop means (20) to releasably retain an article or group of articles (14, 22, 24) therein. Plate member (10) has means to register (32, 34) one or more packages (26) there against so that rotation of plate (10) and package (26) or packages while in registration allows articles (14, 22, 24) in the apertures (12a, 12b, 12c) to move into positions in package (26) predetermined by the position of the apertures (12a, 12b, 12c). The invention also provides process of packaging articles using such a plate member (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR PACKAGING ARTICLESThis specification relates, in general terms, to apparatus for the packaging of articles. The invention also relates to a process for the packaging of articles. The invention is particularly suitable for the packing of multi-article packages, that is to say, packages which contain more than one article, and, to an apparatus and a process for the packing of articles in such packages.In one embodiment the invention relates to the packaging of a plurality of different types of product in a single package. In another embodiment the invention relates to the packaging of the same product type in a package.Numerous problems exist when attempting to automate the packaging of articles, whether, the articles are all the same or different. One such problem is the ability to achieve a high packaging speed while maintaining high accuracy in product numbers and orientation in the finished package.This problem is accentuated where the product is fragile or easily damaged by handling.Where two or more different articles, or groups of articles, are to be packaged in a single pack, other problems occur. One of these is in relation to the accurate positioning of a package within the apparatus, so that it will correctly receive the articles. A further difficulty concerns the orientation of an article when it is packaged. Certain articles need to be packaged with reference to a specific orientation so that the article is received in the desired manner within the package. In particular, some articles have a distinctSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

bottom surface or a specific shape, and, either the package requires that the article sit on the bottom surface, or, that the shape is such that it will only be received correctly with the one specific orientation. These problems are discussed in our co-pending applicationPCT/AU91/00196, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.It is an object of this invention to provide apparatus and a process for packaging articles which is suited to automatic operation, and which achieves a high packaging speed with a high rate of accuracy in product numbers and orientation in the finished package.In accordance with one first aspect of the invention there is provided apparatus for packaging articles comprising a plate member having a plurality of apertures therein, each aperture having at least two openings and being capable of receiving an article, or group of articles, through a first opening thereof; each said of said apertures having

CLAI S
1. Apparatus for packaging articles comprising a plate member having a plurality of apertures therein, each aperture having at least two openings and being capable of receiving an article or group of articles through a first opening thereof; said apertures having non-return stop means provided therein to releasably retain an article or group of articles positioned therein; said plate member also having means to register one or more packages thereagainst, whereupon movement of said plate member while in registration with the said one or more packages, articles releasably retained within said apertures move therefrom through a second opening therein to a position in said one or more packages predetermined by the position of said apertures in said plate member. 2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein each of said apertures has a longitudinal axis; the said longitudinal axes of said apertures being substantially parallel.
3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said apertures extend longitudinally through the length of the plate member.
4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said apertures extend transversely through the thickness of said plate member.
5. Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein said non-return stop means consists of one or more resilient deformable members. 


6. Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein said means to register one or more packages comprises one or more cut-away portions located near the edges of said plate member.
7. Apparatus as claimed in claim 6 wherein said means to register one or more packages further comprises one or more cut out portions in the plate surface between the apertures thereon, into which upstanding internal walls of the package or packages may be received.
8. Apparatus for packaging articles comprising one or more work stations at which a supply of one or more articles to be packaged is provided; means to position a plate member as claimed in any one of the preceding claims at the, or each, work station; means to transfer one or more articles to one or more apertures of said plate member through a first opening thereof so that the article or articles are releasably retained therein by said non-return stop means; means to register one or more packages on said plate member by means of said registration means thereon; means to move said plate member and said one or more packages while in registration, so that articles positioned in said apertures move therefrom through a second opening therein, to positions in said one or more packages predetermined by the position of said apertures in said plate member. 9. Apparatus as claimed in claim 8 wherein the means to position the plate member at the or each work station positions said 



plate member in a generally horizontal orientation at each work station.
10. Apparatus as claimed in claim 8 wherein said means to position the plate member at the or each work station positions said plate member at an inclined angle at the or each work station.
11. A method of packaging articles comprising loading one or more articles into the apertures of a plate member as claimed in any one of claims 1-7 through a first opening in each of said apertures; positioning one or more packages against said plate member, in registration therewith; moving said plate member while in registration with said one or more packages to a position that enables articles within said apertures to move therefrom through a second opening therein to positions in said one or more packages predetermined by the position of the apertures in said plate member. 12. A method as claimed in claim 11 wherein different articles are positioned in said apertures at different work stations. 13. A method as claimed in claim 12 wherein a single package is positioned against said plate member and all articles carried by the plate member are transferred to said package.
