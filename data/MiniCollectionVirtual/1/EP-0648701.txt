<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frictional contact 
driving type of yarn winding machine provided in a 
yarn drawing and false-twisting apparatus, and in particular 
to an apparatus suitable for detecting the revolutions 
of a bobbin to enable determination as to whether 
rotation of the bobbin is on normal or abnormal conditions. The present invention also relates to a frictional 
contact driving type of yarn winding machine provided in 
a yarn drawing and false-twisting apparatus, in particular 
to an apparatus for detecting a yarn abnormally wound 
around a friction roller which is adapted to rotate a 
bobbin and a yarn package wound on the bobbin in frictional 
contact with the bobbin and the package.  As prior-art yarn winding machines for winding a 
yarn treated in the yarn drawing and false-twisting 
machines, there have so far been a wide variety of machines 
represented by a frictional contact driving type 
of yarn winding machine which comprises a pair of bobbin 
holders for holding a bobbin, a pair of cradle arms 
swingably mounted on a stationary frame structure and 
having respective free end portions rotatably supporting 
the bobbin holders in coaxial relationship with each 
other, and a friction roller driven to rotate, the cradle 
arms being swingable between a first angular position 
where the bobbin is held in frictional contact with the  
 
friction roller to have the yarn wound thereon until the 
yarn is fully wound to be formed into a full yarn package 
on the bobbin and a second angular position where the 
yarn package is held out of frictional contact with the 
friction roller. The bobbin with the full yarn package thus wound is 
then exchanged by a new bobbin in a doffing operation 
which is carried out by a package doffing apparatus. In 
recent years, there have been developed numerous package 
doffing apparatus which are all designed to be automatically 
operated to perform such the doffing operation. In the conventional package doffing apparatus, there 
have frequently been encountered such drawbacks that all 
the yarn packages continuously doffed by the package 
doffing apparatus cannot be put into a cardboard box in 
succession when some of the yarn packages are of a size 
exceeding the limit of its predetermined measurement. 
The excessively large yarn packages sometimes entail 
malfunction of a brake system which is assembled in and 
operated in synchronism with the package doffing apparatus, 
with the result that the packages are readily damaged 
if the packages are
