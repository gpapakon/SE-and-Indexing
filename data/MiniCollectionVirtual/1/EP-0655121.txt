<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for transferring cleaning bodies (20) for a heat exchanger (18) through which can flow a cooling fluid. The apparatus requires in the case of discontinuous operation a minimum number of drives operated with external power and has a casing which has an inlet connectable by means of a line (9) to an outlet (15) of the heat exchanger (18), as well as an outlet; a sink space (6), which is connected by means of a controllable closable and openable opening with the interior of the casing and an outlet connectable by means of a line to the heat exchanger (14) and a screening means (3) located in the casing (1) and which is positioned between the outlet of the casing on the one hand and casing inlet on the other. The line (12) linking the outlet of the sink space (6) with the heat exchanger inlet (14) contains a valve (10) controllable by the fluid pressure, and between the outlet of the casing and an inlet of the sink space is provided a pump (4) for delivering water from the casing (1) to the sink space (6), the pressure of the fluid delivered by the pump (4) being selected in such a way that the controllable valve opens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for the transfer of 
cleaning bodies for a heat exchanger through which can flow a 
cooling fluid in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. Such an apparatus is known from EP 148 509 A1. The flow 
through the apparatus is such that in spite of the use of a 
pump the cleaning bodies do not pass through the latter and 
instead take a different flow path by means of which they can 
be transferred back from the heat exchanger outlet to its 
inlet. However, for its operation it is necessary to have two 
motor-operated valves and a motor-operated flap for closing 
and opening an opening, which links the casing having the 
screening device with the sink space. Thus, it is necessary to 
provide three separate motor drives, which in particular make 
smaller installations more expensive. In conjunction with the 
sink space below the flap serving as the casing bottom there 
is an infeed of cleaning bodies either directly (figs. 1 and 
2) or via a bypass (fig. 3) into the heat exchanger inlet. 
When using the bypass solution the cleaning bodies are passed 
out of the sink space into a partial flow branched off the 
main cooling water flow and are transported by it into the 
heat exchanger inlet. The transfer flow for the return of the 
cleaning bodies produced with the pump and commencing at the 
heat exchanger outlet is passed behind the screening device 
via a separate line, in which the pump is located, and consequently 
without the cleaning bodies into the main cooling 
water line or into the heat exchanger inlet. The objective of 
this separation is to ensure that the cleaning bodies do not 
have to pass through the pump which produces the transfer 
flow. US patent 4,079,782 discloses an apparatus in which an outlet  
 
line, in which the pump is located, is connected to the casing. 
The casing has on the bottom a second outlet from which 
can be flushed the cleaning bodies. The pump outlet is connected 
to the second outlet in such a way that the water delivered 
by the pump and sucked out of the casing "entrains", in 
accordance with the jet pump principle, a flow containing the 
cleaning bodies from the second outlet. Also in this known 
apparatus, in which the cleaning bodies circulate continuously 
unlike in the case of the apparatus of EP 148 509 A1, the 
cleaning bodies do not flow through the pump. The problem of the present invention is to provide an apparatus 
for the transfer of cleaning bodies for a heat exchanger 
through which flows a fluid from its outlet
