<ABSTRACT>
A communication control device has a physical interface for physical 
interfacing with a network, a processor (1) for processing high rank 

communication protocol of a frame from the network, a receiving controller (4) 
for processing low rank communication protocol of the frame, and a 

communication buffer (2) for storing the frame in a sequence order received. In 
the device, at least one of the receiving controller has a controller setting 

each of the receiving controller into one of a communication processing 
state, a communication standby state, and a halt state, setting one of the 

receiving controller under the halt state into the communication standby 
state, and selecting a data structure and giving the selected data structure to 

the receiving controller under the communication standby state to process 
the following frame transferred from the network. The receiving controller 

under the communication standby state transits into the communication 
processing state in order to receive the frame and transits into the halt state 

after receiving completion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication control device used 
in a communication station such as a bridge station connecting with Local 
Area Networks (LANs), a file server handling a large volume of data, or 
the like, for which an extremely high communication performance is 
required, and, in particular, to a communication control device which is 
made up of a plurality of communication means, to each of which an 
identical physical address (or an identical station address) is provided to 
spread the frame reception load, and in addition wherein it is possible for a 
high rank protocol processor to receive frames in the sequence received 
from a network so that the reception performance thereof is improved. In a LAN communication control device, various LSIs are designated 
for controlling a MAC (Medium Access Control) layer which is 
standardized by IEEE802 standard. The system configuration for a conventional communication control 
device is made up of three major structural elements, as shown in FIG.1. A 
processor 101 is a processor for executing high rank protocols of an LLC 
(Logical Link Control) layer or higher. A conventional communication 
controller 103 as a communication means is a device for executing 
protocols of a MAC layer or lower. A common memory 102 is a memory 
shared between the processor 101 and the conventional communication 
controller 103. Data received by the communication controller 103 is first 
written into the shared memory 102, then the host computer subsequently 
reads out the data in the shared memory 102 and proceeds with the 
protocol processing. With conventional LSIs for communication control a data structure as 
shown in FIG.2 is constructed in the shared memory 102 and the 
communication data (hereinafter referred to as a frame) is stored in this  
 
structure so that the processor 101 can easily process the data. This structure of the conventional communication controller 103 will 
now be explained in detail. FIG.2A shows the structure of a frame buffer FB used for storing 
communication data. The frame buffer FB has a data region 205, a data 
region head address 202, a data length 203 for the data stored in the data 
region, and link data 201 showing the address of the next frame buffer FB, 
and the like. The data which makes up the frame is divided up and stored 
in the data region 205, therefore one frame is managed by listing and 
joining together a plurality of frame buffers FB. FIG.2B shows the structure of a frame descriptor FD used for 
controlli
