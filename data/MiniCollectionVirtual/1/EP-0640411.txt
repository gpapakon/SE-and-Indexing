<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dust removing system. A casing (4) 
having an air discharging chamber (2) and an air sucking 

chamber (3) is provided with a first jetting nozzle (11) and 
a second jetting nozzle (12) on the underside thereof. The 

first jetting nozzle (11) and the second jetting nozzle (12) 
blow supersonic jets such that these approach each other. A 

sucking nozzle (9) is located between the first jetting 
nozzle (11) and the second jetting nozzle (12) to allow the 

working air to be sucked into the casing (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dust removing system.In a known dust removing systems
shown in Fig 9,
a dust
removing head 113 is located above work 102 which has dust
removed from the surface thereof, so as to intersect the
traveling direction of the work 102 at right angles. This dust
removing head 113 is provided with a casing 103 which is
separated into a downstream side air discharging chamber 105
and an upstream side air sucking chamber 106 by using a
partition wall 104, and also with a supersonic generator 107
located within the air discharging chamber 105.Moreover, the air discharging chamber 105 is mounted with
a jetting nozzle 108 such that it is opened inside the air
discharging chamber, and this jetting nozzle 108 is communicatively
connected to the supersonic generator 107. The air
sucking chamber 106 is provided with a sucking nozzle 109 such
that it is opened inside the air sucking chamber. In order to remove dust 110 from the work 102, the jetting
nozzle 108 jets supersonic operating air obliquely downwardly
therefrom onto the surface of the work 102 while the
work 102 is moved in the direction shown by means of an arrow
101. The supersonic operating air is air which has ultrasonic
waves incorporated therein. The ultrasonic waves incorporated
in the air jetted from the jetting nozzle 108 and what is
called the air-knife operation of the air flow created by the
supersonic air jointly cooperate to produce a synergistic
effect in which the dust 110 is exfoliated from the work 102.
The dust as exfoliated from the work, and the supersonic air
are sucked into the air sucking chamber 106 by means of the
sucking nozzle 109.However, in the foregoing known dust removing
system, the supersonic operating air emitted from the jetting
nozzle 108 passes in a single direction towards the upstream
side of the work 102, and for this reason, an air boundary
layer 112 is occasionally introduced on the surface of the work
102. The introduction of the air boundary layer 112 would
confine the dust 110 into it, and could not exfoliate the dust
from the work 102. This is a disadvantage of the known
dust removing system.
Such a system is disclosed in EP-A-0565811 published 20.10.93. Conventional dust removing systems are known from EP-A-0520145
and from US-3,915,739. The former discloses an apparatus for
carrying off dust in which two nozzles generate air streams
that are directed towards one another
and an inlet is provided therebetween.
A further feature of
this apparatus is the provision of a discharge
