<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink, and an ink-jet
recording method and instruments making use of the
ink. In particular, it relates to an ink which can provide
images excellent in water fastness on non-coated
paper such as paper for copying, paper for reporting,
notepaper, letter paper, bond paper and continuous
business forms, i.e., so-called plain paper, which are
commonly used in offices and homes, and is excellent in
solution stability and suitable for use in a system
capable of high-image quality recording using bubble-jet
printer, and an ink-jet recording method and instruments
making use of such an ink.The present invention also relates to an ink-jet
recording ink, and particularly to an ink which can
provide images excellent in water fastness on all
recording materials, in particular, non-coated paper such
as paper for copying, paper for reporting, notepaper,
letter paper, bond paper and continuous business forms,
i.e., so-called plain paper, which are commonly used in
offices and homes, has an ideal black color, and is
excellent in solution stability and suitable for use in a 
system capable of high-image quality recording using
bubble-jet printer, and a recording method and instruments
making use of such an ink.Further, this invention relates to an ink capable of
conducting recording free of feathering and unevenness of
color strength on plain paper, and an ink-jet recording
method making use of such an ink.Still further, the present invention relates to a
method of preventing the association of a dye. Inks with greatly various manners of being composed
have been hitherto reported in respect of inks for ink-jet
recording. In particular, in recent years, detailed
researches and developments have been made from various
aspects such as compositions and physical properties of
inks because of a demand for improving the water fastness
of images upon recording on plain paper such as paper for
copying, paper for reporting, notepaper, letter paper,
bond paper and continuous business forms, which are
commonly used in offices.For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Nos. 2-296878 and 2-255876 have proposed to contain a
polyamine in a water-based ink composition.In such an ink, however, the polyamine forms a salt
with a hydrophilic group in a dye contained in the ink,
and so the solution stability of the ink is lowered.
Therefore, there are potential problems of reduction in
reliability such as clogging at the tip of an orifice, and
of bronzing (association of the dye) on a recording
