<ABSTRACT>
There is described a novel circuit that identifies the 
defective redundant word lines in the memory unit of a 

state of the art SRAM macro including an ABIST structure 
and a redundancy mechanism. The novel circuit (41) combines 

existing signals: the selection signals R1 to Rq, 
the RESULT and the COMPOSITE RESULT signals that are generated 

as standard in such macros. The selection signals 
R1 to Rq indicate whether or not a redundant word line has 

been selected. The RESULT signal indicates whether or not 
the memory unit at the address being tested is defective 

after a READ operation. The COMPOSITE RESULT signal indicates 
that the number of fails detected exceeds the number 

q of redundant word lines. All these signals run on a 
cycle per cycle basis. According to the invention, the 

selection signals R1 to Rq are applied to a q-way OR gate 
(42) whose output is connected to a latch (43). The signal 

which is output by the latch and the RESULT signal are 
ANDed in a 2-way AND gate (44). The signal (RLBU**) which 

is generated by the AND gate (44) indicates whether or not 
the redundant word line that was used is defective. In a 

preferred embodiment, this signal (RLBU**), and the COMPOSITE 
RESULT signal are applied as inputs to a 3-way OR 

gate (26'), whose output is connected to a self-maintained 
latch (27), referred to as the "not fixable" latch. The 

third input of said 3-way OR gate is connected to the "not 
fixable" latch output. If there is a fail on a redundant 

word line, the "not fixable" latch is set to indicate a 
non repairable state of the SRAM macro memory unit. As a 

result, a two-pass fuse blow process is now made possible,  
 

which significantly increases the manufacturing yields and 
repairability of said SRAM macro.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the test of integrated 
circuits of the memory type, such as stand-alone SRAMs or 
logic arrays with embedded SRAM macros provided with built-in 
self-test and redundancy capabilities, fabricated in 
semiconductor chips. It more particularly relates to a 
novel circuit that identifies the defective word lines of 
the memory unit redundant array. As a result, a second 
pass of fuse blow after the burn-in step is thus allowed, 
thus significantly improving the repairability of said 
integrated circuits. As memories get faster, more complex, and denser, there is 
an increasing demand on ABIST (Array Built-In Self-Test) 
structures for logic and memory fault detection offering 
high speed and high test coverage, while consuming minimal 
area on the semiconductor chip. In addition, it is also 
highly desired to have a redundancy mechanism (word or bit 
line) to be combined therewith for repairability purposes. 
The combination of these two features will become more 
prevalent in a close future in the manufacturing of large 
memories due to a number of reasons including testing 
cost/time and yield improvement. For example, to date, in 
conventional SRAM macros implementing this combined feature, 
the replacement of defective lines by redundant 
lines is performed on product chips at the wafer level 
before the burn-in step and is limited to a single pass of 
fuse blow, as it will be now explained in conjunction with 
Figs. 1 to 3.  For sake of illustration, Fig. 1 shows the block diagram 
architecture of a state of the art SRAM macro 10 provided 
with an ABIST unit 11. A similar architecture is described 
in Ref. D1: US-A-5 173 906 assigned to the assignee of the 
present invention. The functional units shown in Fig. 1, 
either form a part of a stand-alone SRAM or the SRAM macro 
of a logic array of an integrated circuit chip. In the 
latter case, the chip may include a plurality of such 
macros, each being provided with its own dedicated ABIST 
unit. The said integrated circuit chip is part of a wafer 
fabricated in a very large scale integration (VLSI) semiconductor 
technology and is designed according to level-sensitive 
scan design (LSSD) rules. As known for those ordinary skilled in the art, the SRAM 
macro 10 of Fig. 1 has three basic operating modes. The 
first one is the SYSTEM mode, according to which the SRAM 
macro 10 is in normal operation, i.e. where the memory 
unit 12 is either read or written, using the data-in signals 
DATAIN1 to DATAINM, the SRAM address

   a memory unit (12) formed by a regular array (12A'), 
a redundant array (12A'') and a comparator (12C); 

   a dedicated ABIST unit (11) for the self-test of the

fail latch block (16C), to process the said first

the word line address being used with the addresses

   a 2-way AND gate (44) whose first input is connected 
to the output of said latch (43) and whose second 

input is driven by the said first signal (RESULT) to

the redundant word line that was used is defective

   a 3-way OR gate (26') and the "not fixable" latch
