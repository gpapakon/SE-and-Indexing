A computer method enables a plurality of character recognition 
programs to recognize characters inscribed on a filled out 

version of the document form. The method enables a user to 
create a plurality of form definition data sets in a single 

working session, in a user friendly manner. It also enables 
the modification of form definition data sets in an easy,

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed broadly relates to data processing 
and more particularly relates to character recognition of 
document forms. This patent application is related to the copending European 
patent applications 93104766.6 published as EP 0565911-A, 93104767.4 published as EP 0565912-A, 94105292.0 
and the US patent US 5140650-A. Data contained in digitized images can be extracted for a 
number of purposes, and in many different ways. A 
prerequisite for extracting information from forms is 
knowledge of the types and locations of the data (information 
about the "fields" of the form). Currently, most forms 
processing applications have their own method for "defining" 
forms, and each method is incompatible with the others. In 
large image systems which use several different forms 
processing applications, each form needs to be separately 
defined for each application, which costs time and introduces 
inconsistencies in the form definitions. The method presented 
here creates form definitions which can then be used for 
almost any forms processing application.  
 US-A-5,119,437 describes a tabular document reader service 
for recognizing characters on a tabular document. No 
plurality of OCR programs is used there, no conversion means 
for modifying data formats and field definintions are only 
obtained using a filled-in form. EP-A- 0 463 471 describes an image processing system for 
documentary data which does not provide for the generation 
and processing of a plurality of form definition data. It is therefore an object of the invention to make a 
plurality of form definition data sets for enabling a given 
document form to be read by a corresponding plurality of 
character recognition programs. It is another object of the invention to make a plurality of 
form definition data sets in a single working session, for 
use by a corresponding plurality of character recognition 
programs. It is another object of the invention to make a plurality of 
form definition data sets in an improved manner, for enabling 
a given document form to be read by a corresponding plurality 
of character recognition programs. It is another object of the invention to enable the 
modification of form definition data sets in an improved 
manner. These objects are accomplished by the invention as specified 
in claims 1 and 2; embodiments of the invention are described 
in the dependent claims. The invention is a method to define, 
in a single working session, a plurality of form definition 
data sets for a particular master
