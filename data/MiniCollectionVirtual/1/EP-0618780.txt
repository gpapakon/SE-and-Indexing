<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally pertains to apparatus for monitoring
the volumetric output of a heart, and more specifically, to apparatus
for making this determination by using an injectateless technique that changes the
temperature of blood in the heart.Cardiac output, the volumetric rate at which blood is pumped through the
heart, is most often determined clinically by injecting a bolus of chilled saline or
glucose solution into the right auricle or right ventricle through a catheter. A
thermistor disposed in the pulmonary artery is used to determine a temperature-time
washout curve as the chilled injectate/blood mixture is pumped from the
heart. The area under this curve provides an indication of cardiac output.
Although this thermo-dilution method can give an indication of cardiac output at
the time the procedure is performed, it cannot be used for continuously monitoring
cardiac output. Moreover, the frequency with which the procedure is performed is
limited by its adverse effects on a patient, including the dilution of the patient's
blood that occurs each time the chilled fluid is injected. In addition, the procedure
poses an infection hazard to medical staff from blood contact, and to the patient,
from exposure to possibly contaminated injectate fluid or syringes.Alternatively, blood in the heart can be chilled or heated in an injectateless
method by a heat transfer process using a temperature-conditioned fluid that is
pumped in a closed loop, toward the heart through one lumen within the catheter
and back through another lumen. The principal advantages of using such a non-injectate
heat transfer process to change the temperature of blood are that the blood 
is not diluted, and the temperature differential between the blood and the heat
exchanger is much less compared to the temperature differential between an
injectate fluid and blood in the typical thermal dilution procedure.U.S. Patent No. 4,819,655 (Webler) discloses an injectateless method and
apparatus for determining cardiac output. In Webler's preferred embodiment, a
saline solution is chilled by a refrigeration system or ice bath and introduced into a
catheter that has been inserted through a patient's cardiovascular system into the
heart. The catheter extends through the right auricle and right ventricle and its
distal end is disposed just outside the heart in the pulmonary artery. A pump
forces the chilled saline solution through a closed loop fluid path defined by two
lumens in the catheter, so that heat transfer occurs between the solution

Apparatus (10) for continuously monitoring a cardiac
output of a heart, comprising:


(a) a catheter (14) having a plurality of lumens that
extend generally between a proximal end (16) and a distal (18)

end of the catheter (14), the distal end (18) of the catheter
being insertable into a heart (12) through a cardiovascular

system;
(b) means for supplying a periodically varying,
temperature modifying input signal to a portion (22) of the

catheter (14) that is spaced apart from its distal end;
(c) a blood temperature sensor (24) disposed adjacent
the distal end (18) of the catheter (14), said temperature

sensor (24) being provided to produce a blood temperature signal
that is indicative of a temperature of blood flowing from the

heart;
(d) means (36) for determining power transferred by
the temperature modifying input signal, said means for

determining producing a corresponding periodically varying power

corresponds to the input signal; characterized in that
(e) a phase comparator for determining a difference
in phase between the periodically varying power signal and the

periodically varying temperature signal; and

determining power transferred comprise a first temperature

sensor (104) that monitors the temperature of the temperature-conditioned
fluid (84) pumped into the catheter (14'), a second

temperature sensor (106) that monitors the temperature of the
temperature-conditioned fluid as it returns from the heart, and

means for determining the rate of flow of said fluid, the
control means determining the power transferred as a function of

the difference in temperature of the temperature-conditioned
fluid monitored by the first and the second temperature sensors

(104, 106), and of the rate of flow of the temperature-conditioned
fluid in the catheter (14').
The apparatus (10) of Claim 4, wherein the means for
supplying further comprise a fluid chiller that cools the

temperature conditioned fluid (84) substantially below a
temperature of blood entering the heart (12).
The apparatus (10) of Claim 4, wherein the fluid (84)
is heated substantially above a normal temperature of blood 

entering the heart (12).
The apparatus (10) of Claim 1, wherein the cardiac

CO = |P(ω)|*COSΔΦ/(|T(ω)|*Cb)

CO
