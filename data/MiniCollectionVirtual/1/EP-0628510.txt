<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure and 
an apparatus for triggering the safety 

gear of an elevator at a speed lower than 
the gripping speed. The overspeed governor 

of the elevator comprises a pulley 
(3) driven by the safety gear rope and a 

brake (5) connected to it by means of 
knuckle pins (14,14'), said brake being 

provided with centrifugal weights 
(16,16'), eccentric cams (15,15') and a 

brake disc (6). At a speed lower than the 
gripping speed, using a separately controlled 

solenoid (30) attached to the 
overspeed governor, the brake (5) is 

caused to engage the pulley (3) by 
driving the plunger of the solenoid into 

the path of rubber rollers (31,32) 
rotating with the centrifugal weights.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure as defined in
the preamble of claim 1 and an apparatus as defined in the
preamble of claim 4 for triggering the safety gear of an
elevator at a speed lower than the gripping speed in an
elevator in which the triggering of the safety gear in an
overspeed situation is effected by means of a rope driving
an overspeed governor via a rope pulley in such manner that
when the orbit of the centrifugal weights in the overspeed
governor assumes a width exceeding the orbit corresponding
to the set gripping speed, this will cause coupling elements to
engage a brake
comprised in the overspeed governor whereafter the rope
pulley, due to friction, brakes the rope driving the pulley itself and
thus triggers the safety gear of the elevator.Conventionally, elevators are equipped with a safety gear
which is triggered by an overspeed governor. A common solution
is such that when the elevator speed in the overspeed
governor reaches a preset limit, the overspeed governor
triggers the safety gear by means of the same rope that
transmits the elevator speed to the overspeed governor. The
structure and operation of an overspeed governor of this
type is described in Finnish patent publication no. 76049.In addition to gripping in an overspeed situation, situations
occur in which the safety gear ought to be activated
even if the elevator speed does not exceed the allowed
limit. These situations include the testing of the safety
gear in connection with the inspection of the elevator. For
instance, certain elevators using a geared hoisting machinery
cannot usually be accelerated to the gripping speed,
requiring exceptional measures to allow the gripping function
to be checked. Failure situations may also occur where
it should be possible to stop the elevator independently of
the hoisting machinery and the operating brake. A failure
situation of this type is e.g. when an elevator starts from
a floor with doors completely or partially open. Another problem at present is that the overspeed governor
has to be placed in a loaction where it can be accessed
during inspection. If the elevator has a machine room, this
is no problem, but in the case of other solutions regarding
the machinery, when the overspeed governor is placed in the
elevator shaft, a separate manhole is needed to permit the
overspeed governor to be locked by way of exception in
connection with inspection.To meet the need described above and to solve the problems
referred to, a procedure and an apparatus are presented as
an

Procedure for triggering the safety gear at a speed lower
than the gripping speed in an elevator in which the triggering

of the safety gear in an overspeed situation is effected by
means of a rope driving an overspeed governor via a rope pulley

(3) in such a way that when the centrifugal weights (16, 16')
in the overspeed governor assume an orbit outside of the orbit

corresponding to the set gripping speed, this will cause
coupling elements (15,15') to engage a brake (5) comprised in

the overspeed governor whereafter the rope pulley (3), due to
friction, brakes the rope driving the pulley itself and thus

triggers the safety gear of the elevator,
characterized
 in that

the coupling elements (15,15') are caused to engage the brake
(5) by means of an obstruction device (30) attached to the

overspeed governor which obstructs the path of the coupling
elements thereby moving them into engagement with the brake. 
Procedure according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that, to
trigger the safety gear, the coupling elements (15,15')

are deflected from the orbital distance from the
shaft (2) corresponding to their current speed of rotation by

means of an obstruction (33) brought into the path of said
elements.
Procedure according to claim 2,

characterized
 in that deflecting the coupling elements (15,15')
from the orbital distance from the shaft (2)

corresponding to their current speed of rotation by means of
the obstruction (33) brought into the path of the element

also activates a switch (27) switching off the operating
current of the elevator. 
Apparatus for triggering the safety gear at a speed lower
than the gripping speed in an elevator in which the triggering

of the safety gear in an overspeed situation is effected by
means of a rope driving an overspeed governor via a rope pulley

(3) in such a way that when the centrifugal weights (16,16') in
the overspeed governor assume an orbit outside of the orbit

corresponding to said gripping speed, this will cause coupling
elements (15,15') to engage a brake (5) comprised in the over-speed

governor whereafter the rope pulley (3), due to friction,
brakes the rope driving pulley itself and thus triggers the

safety gear of the elevator,
characterized
 in that

to cause the coupling elements (15,15') to engage the brake (5),
the apparatus comprises an obstruction device (30) attached to 

the overspeed governor which obstructs the path of the coupling
elements, thereby moving them into engagement with the brake. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that it
comprises at least one element (31,32) rotating along with

each coupling element and an obstruction (33) supported by
the support of the apparatus and designed to be moved to a

distance from the shaft (2) corresponding to an orbital distance
of the element (31,32) corresponding to a rotational

speed below the gripping speed.
Apparatus according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in
that at least either the obstruction (33) or the element

(31,32) hitting it on its orbital path is provided with an
elastic part for the impact.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims
4-6, 
characterized
 in that the obstruction device (30) is
provided with separate control means in the form of a solenoid with a

plunger (33).
