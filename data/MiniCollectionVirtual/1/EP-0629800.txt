<ABSTRACT>
A labyrinth type seal assembly having one or more 
controlled porosity elements retained in the labyrinth pathway 

between relatively rotatable seal elements. Preferably the 
controlled porosity elements are formed of open celled foam 

material such as polyurethane. The controlled porosity 
elements assist in preventing the ingress of contaminating 

solid or liquid materials, the loss of sealed materials and 
the flooding or overloading of drain ports.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rotary shaft seals which
prevent lubricants associated with shaft bearings from leaking
externally of the bearing housing as well as preventing
foreign particles in the environment from working themselves
through the seal and into the lubricant. More particularly,
the invention concerns labyrinth type seals and the use of
controlled porosity material retained between rotor and stator
seal elements to help regulate and control fluid and particle
movement.Many years ago, bearings were often sealed by using a felt
or similar sealing element positioned in contact with a rotary
shaft and typically held in place by a metal shell. More
recently, shaft bearings have mostly been sealed either with
flexible lip seals or with labyrinth seals. However, each of
these seals presents various operational problems. More
specifically, lip seals have a finite and unpredictable life,
they damage the surface on which the lip runs, they increase
power consumption because of running torque, and they have
limited temperature and speed capabilities. Drawbacks to
labyrinth seals include an open path which does not totally
prevent ingress of contaminants, a limited capacity to
accommodate shaft misalignment and run out and an inability to
handle fluid levels above the drain port or ports. In prior labyrinth assemblies there have been instances in
which excessive amounts of lubricant or other fluids have
entered the labyrinth pathway in such volume that all of the
fluid was unable to drain back into the internal cavity
through the interior drain ports. In such instances, the
excess fluid continues outwardly along the labyrinth pathway
until it ultimately escapes from the exterior end of the
labyrinth pathway or through an exterior drain port. In a
somewhat similar manner, particulate contaminants of fluid
and/or solid form have sometimes been able to pass inwardly
along the labyrinth pathway to ultimately contaminate the
internal cavity and its bearings. From EP 0 012 133 A1 a shaft seal for sealing a mixture of a liquid and a gas
is known. Within a labyrinth type pathway of the shaft seal, there are
provided a sealing lip and a porous flange. At lower rotational speeds of the
shaft, the sealing function is predominantly achieved by the sealing lip. At
higher rotational speeds of the shaft, the sealing performance of the sealing
lip is reduced due to centrifugal force, and the porous flange becomes
effective. The flange separates the liquid components from the gaseous
components in the mixture and
