<DESCRIPTION>
This application in general relates to several unique
anchoring retainers for use with threaded fasteners that
incorporate improvements over the prior art.In the prior art, anchoring retainers are used to hold
a threaded fastener such as a bolt or screw in a wall. One
known type of anchoring retainer can be used in either a
blind hole in a solid wall, or alternatively may be used in
a thin wall, such as a drywall wall, where the threaded
fastener extends entirely through the wall.One known anchoring retainer is that described in US
Patent 4,943,253. This patent discloses a fastener-receiving
member which can be adjusted in length to be
accommodated within various thicknesses of walls. A wing-like
locking section is provided, which expands on
tightening of the fastener to ensure an adequate grip
between the wall and the retainer.It is desirable to improve upon the prior art
anchoring retainers to ensure that they securely retain the
threaded fastener within the wall. To this end, it is
desirable to optimize the structure of the anchoring
retainer such that it locks in place on the wall at a
desired position which provides the strongest connection.
Further, it is an object of the present invention to
develop an anchoring retainer which is easily utilizable. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there
is provided an anchoring retainer comprising a base at a
first axial end, said base having a threaded bore to
receive a threaded fastener; a member spaced axially from
said base, said member having a bore for sliding on a
threaded fastener, and at least a pair of arms, one inner
arm and one outer arm, connecting said base and said
member; said outer arm extending radially outwardly from
said base and connected to a portion of said inner arm at
a joint, said inner arm portion extending radially inwardly
to said member; characterised in that said joint includes
a hinge and at least one relief which relief in formed in the inner surface
of said outer arm, said relief in combination with said
hinge controlling bending movement of said radially outer
and inner arms on tightening of the retainer.These and other features of the present invention can
be best understood from the following specification and
drawings, of which the following is a brief description.Figure 1 shows an anchoring retainer in accordance
with one embodiment of the present invention.Figure 2 is a side view of the retainer shown in
Figure 1.Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view along line 3-3 
as shown in Figure 1.Figure 4 is an end view

<CLAIMS>
An anchoring retainer (90) comprising:

a base (92) at a first axial end, said base (92)
having a threaded bore to receive a threaded fastener;
a member (94) spaced axially from said base (92), said
member (94) having a bore for sliding on a threaded

fastener, and at least a pair of arms, one inner arm (98)
and one outer arm (96), connecting said base (92) and said

member (94);
said outer arm (96) extending radially outwardly from
said base (92) and connected to a portion of said inner arm

(98) at a joint (100), said inner arm portion extending
radially inwardly to said member (94); 
characterized in
that
said joint (100) includes a hinge and at least one
relief (104) which relief is formed in the inner surface of said outer arm,

said relief in combination with said hinge controlling
bending movement of said radially outer and inner arms (96,

98) on tightening of the retainer.
An anchoring retainer (90) as recited in claim 1,
wherein the relief (104) forms a hinge (104) and said

radially outer and inner arms (96, 98) pivot about the
hinge (104) as the retainer (90) is tightened.
An anchoring retainer (90) as recited in claim 2,
wherein the relief (104) is arranged to cause the joint

(100) to pivot and apply pressure against a wall via an
outer tip (114) of said joint (100) as the retainer (90) is

tightened.
An anchoring retainer (90) as recited in any of claims
1, 2 or 3, wherein said at least one relief (104) formed in

the inner surface of said outer arm (96) is constructed to
provide at least two ramped surfaces (110, 112) that will

abut each other to control deformation of said radially
outer and inner arms (96, 98) as the retainer (90) is

tightened. 
An anchoring retainer (90) as recited in claim 4,
wherein the relief (104) with abutting ramped

surfaces (110, 112) in the outer arm (96) controls the
bending movement of said radially outer and inner arms (96,

98) and biases an outer tip (114) of the joint (100) into
contact with a wall as the retainer (90) is tightened.
An anchoring retainer (90) as recited in claim 4,
wherein the angles of the abutting ramped surfaces (110,

112) control the bending movement of said radially outer
and inner arms (96, 98).
An anchoring retainer (90) as recited in claim 6,
wherein said angles can vary.
An anchoring retainer (90) as recited in claim 6,
wherein the form of said relief (104; 148) may be varied to

control the shape and dimension of the retainer.
An anchoring retainer as recited in claim 6 wherein
the relief (104) with the ramped surface (110, 112)

in said outer arm (96) will produce pivoting of the joint
(100) to forcibly apply pressure against a wall as the

retainer (90) is tightened.
