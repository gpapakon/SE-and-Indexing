<ABSTRACT>
A signaling provider network which receives and transmits at least a subset of all 
signaling information associated with a particular call or communication service, 

allows the received/transmitted signaling information to be processed independently 
of the originating or terminating communication carrier network which originates 

and/or completes the call, or provides the communication service.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems. In today's communications environment, it is quite common for a user 
to subscribe to services (including signaling services) offered by different 
communications carrier networks, such as a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) network, 
a Cellular Communications Carrier network and a Community Antenna Television 
(CATV) distribution network better known as a "cable television network". While 
some of these networks are sometimes connected at the physical level, no 
comprehensive logical mechanism currently exists to allow a subscriber of a specific 
one of these networks to benefit from features and signaling services offered by 
another one of these networks for calls routed through that specific network. For 
example, prior art communications systems do not allow signaling services that may 
be offered by a CATV network to be available to a LEC subscriber for calls routed 
exclusively over the facilities of that LEC network. The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for a) communicating 
signaling information which is associated with a communication service between a 
first network (e.g., a signaling provider network) and a caller device over a first 
facility, and b) establishing a connection for said communication service between the 
caller device and a second network through a communication path which includes a 
second physical facility which is separate and distinct from the first facility and 
which is connected to said caller device. The signaling provider network may be an 
independent network or a subnetwork of a communications carrier network, such as 
a LEC, a CATV, an interexchange carrier, or a cellular communications network. In preferred embodiments of the invention, a premises-based signaling 
transfer device that is physically connected to at least one end-user device and at 
least one communications carrier network, recognizes and intercepts at least one 
signaling message that is initiated by, or destined for the end-user device. For 
outgoing communications services, the signaling transfer device detects signaling 
indicia, such as Q.931 signaling messages or Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) 
signals, generated by the end-user device and forwards those signaling indicia to a 
signaling provider network via the access facilities of a selected communications 
carrier network. Upon receiving the signaling information, the signaling provider  
 
network processes that information, and returns to the signaling transfer device
