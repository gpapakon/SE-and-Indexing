process as well as their organoleptic utilities for augmenting 

or enhancing the aroma or taste of consumable materials

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a microbial process for 
the production of compositions of matter containing unsaturated 
lactones. Considerable time and effort have been expended by 
microbiologists in the search for better processes for the 
production of unsaturated lactones; and more generally lactones 
per se. U.S. Letters Patent No. 3,076,750 discloses a method 
of preparing certain optically active lactones and the 
corresponding hydroxycarboxylic acids by microbial reduction of 
ketocarboxylic acids. The metabolism of ricinoleic acid by 
some Candida strains was investigated by Okui, et al 
(J.Biochemistry, 54,536-540, 1963) who shows that gamma 
hydroxydecanoic acid was an intermediate in the oxidative 
degradation of ricinoleic acid. However, only trace amounts of 
gamma hydroxydecanoic acid were recovered from the fermentation 
medium due to the metabolysis of gamma hydroxydecanoic acid 
upon completion of the fermentation, and the toxicity of 
ricinoleic acid to the microorganism, which limits the amount 
of substrate that can be used. U.S. Letters Patent 4,560,656 provided a method of 
producing optically active gamma hydroxydecanoic acid 
comprising culturing or incubating a microorganism capable of 
hydrolyzing castor oil, and effecting beta-oxidation of the 
resulting hydrolysate in the presence of castor oil, to produce 
gamma hydroxydecanoic acid. U.S. Letters 4,560,656 also provided a method of producing 
optically active gamma hydroxydecanoic acid comprising 
enzymatically hydrolyzing castor oil using lipase to form an 
enzymatic hydrolysate and culturing or incubating a 
microorganizm capable of effecting beta-oxidation of the 
enzymatic hydrolysate in the presence of said hydrolysate to 
produce gamma hydroxydecanoic acid.  
 U.S. Letters Patent 4,560,656 also provided a method of 
producing optically active gamma hydroxydecanoic acid 
comprising culturing or incubating a microorganism capable of 
hydrolyzing castor oil and a microorganism capable of effecting 
beta-oxidation of castor oil hydrolysate in the presence of 
castor oil to produce gamma hydroxydecanoic acid. European Published Patent Application 258993 published on 
April 9, 1988 discloses a process for the production of 
optically active gamma hydroxydecanoic acid suitable for 
conversion to optically active gamma decalactone. The process 
covers steps of: 
(a) culturing sporobolomyces odorous; and/or 
rhodotorula glutinis on a medium containing a 
ricinoleic acid source at 15-35°C at a pH of 3-9 and 
optionally; and
