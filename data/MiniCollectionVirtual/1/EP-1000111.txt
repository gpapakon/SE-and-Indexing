<ABSTRACT>
Polysiloxane polyols and curable coating compositions containing such polysiloxane polyols are disclosed. When present as a component in both ambient-cure and thermal-cure coating compositions the polysiloxane polyols provide improved adhesion, pot-life, tack-times, mar resistance, excellent appearance, film hardness and corrosion resistance. A method for preparing such polysiloxane polyols is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Polysiloxane polyols are well known in the art. Japanese Patent Publication 48-19941
describes polysiloxane polyols which are obtained by the dehydrogenation
reaction between a polysiloxane hydride and an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol or
polyoxyalkylene alcohol to introduce the alcoholic hydroxy groups onto the polysiloxane
backbone. In practice, however, it is difficult to obtain an industrially significant yield of
such polysiloxane polyols because such a dehydrogenation reaction readily gels. Another
problem encountered with this dehydrogenation reaction is the difficulty in obtaining a
solvent capable of dissolving both reactants. Strongly hydrophilic alcohols such as
polyglycerols are highly soluble in alcohols and water, but insoluble in hydrocarbon
solvents. Polysiloxanes, however, are generally only soluble in hydrocarbon solvents
such as toluene or n-hexane.U.S. Pat. No. 4,431,789 to Okazaki et al. discloses a polysiloxane polyol which is
obtained by the dehydrosilylation reaction between a polysiloxane containing silicon
hydride and a polyglycerol compound having an aliphatically unsaturated linkage in the
molecule. Examples of such polyglycerol compounds are those obtained by the reaction
of allyl alcohol and glycidol or by the reaction of diglycerin and allyl glycidyl ether.
This reaction, a so-called hydrosilylation reaction, is the addition reaction between an
organosilicon compound having a hydrogen atom directly bonded to the silicon atom,
i.e., a polysiloxane hydride, and an organic compound having aliphatic unsaturation in
the molecule carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of a Group VIII noble
metal. The hydrosilylation reaction can proceed readily in the presence of an alcoholic
solvent which can dissolve both reactants. The resulting polysiloxane polyols are useful
as non-ionic surface active agents. As each polyglycerol group provides only one
terminal primary hydroxyl, the capacity of the polysiloxane polyol to crosslink with
curing agents such as isocyanates, anhydrides and aminoplasts is somewhat hindered.U.S. 5,260,469 discloses butoxylated polysiloxane polyols which are disclosed as
being useful in cosmetics. U.S. 5,395,955 discloses a method for the preparation of a carbinol-modified
organopolysiloxane which involves the platinum-catalyzed reaction of an
organopolysiloxane having at least one silicon-bonded hydrogen atom in each molecule
and an organic compund which contains at least one aliphatically unsaturated
hydrocarbon group and a triorganosilyl-blocked
