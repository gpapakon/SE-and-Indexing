<ABSTRACT>
Device for coupling (connecting) tubes (18) including a body (1) provided with a bore (2) to receive the end of this tube and means for retaining the tube in the bore, which device is made up of a substantially frustoconical washer (13) of which the internal circumference is of smaller diameter than that of the tube and is divided into a plurality of teeth (14), the outer part of the washer being located in a groove (12) formed in the bore (2). Each tooth (14) of the washer is made up of a bladelet (14) having a root part (15) and being of small height which at rest extends in a radial plane and an active part (16) inclined to the radial plane of the root (15) and is connected to the adjacent teeth (14) by a peripheral linkage part (17) of small cross-section and of which the length (L) is at least equal to the length (l) of each tooth 14.

A coupling device for a tube (18), the device comprising
a body (1) provided with a bore (2) for receiving the end of

said tube and means for retaining the tube in the bore, which
means are constituted by an elastically deformable washer

(13) that is substantially frustoconical in shape, whose
inside circumference is of a diameter smaller than the

outside diameter of the tube, and which is subdivided into a
plurality of teeth (14), the outside portion of the washer

being disposed in a groove (12) formed in the bore (2), each
tooth (14) possessing a short root portion (15) which, at

rest, extends in a radial plane, and an active portion (16)
that is inclined relative to the radial plane of the root

(15), and each tooth (14) being connected to the teeth
adjacent thereto via peripheral link portions (17) such that

deformation of the washer (13) as a whole gives rise to
displacement of the teeth (14) without deformation thereof,

the device being characterized in that each peripheral link
portion (17) is elastically deformable in the groove (12) and

in that each tooth (14) is individually undeformable with
respect to a raising force radially oriented resulting from

the introduction of the tube and is able to pivot around each
of the peripheral link portions (17) which connect it to the

adjacent teeth.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that each
tooth (14) is trapezium-shaped, with its larger base being

situated at the inside edge of the washer (13).
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in
that the angle (a) between the root (15) of each tooth and

the active portion (16) thereof is of the order of 25Â°.
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that the length (L) of each peripheral link portion (17) 

is not less than the length (
l
) of each tooth (14).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that the ratio between the width (
e
) of the link portions
(17) and the total width of the tooth washer (13) is about

one-fifth.
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized
in that the groove (12) in the bore (2) receiving the

peripheral portion of the washer (13) has a downstream flank
(19) that is inclined.
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that the
bottom of the groove (12) is of a width that is greater than

the thickness of the washer.
A device according to claim 6 or 7, including a tubular
pusher (20) slidably mounted inside the bore (2) to slide

between an inactive extended first position and an active
retracted second position, in which the teeth of the washer

are splayed apart from their rest position by the nose (23)
of the pusher, the device being characterized in that the

nose of the pusher, when in its inactive position,
constitutes an abutment for the teeth (14) when an excessive

extraction force is applied to the tube (18), each tooth
pivoting thereabout so that the peripheral portion of the

washer then bears against the inclined flank (19) of the
groove (12).
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that after
pivoting, the washer is in a second stable s

hape in which the root (15) of each tooth is inclined while
the active portion (16) thereof lies in a plane that is

substantially radial.
