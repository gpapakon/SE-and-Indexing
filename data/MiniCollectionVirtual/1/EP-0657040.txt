<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns materials with non-linear optical properties and which contain more than 10 conjugated double bonds in the molecule. The non-linear optical properties can be produced either by use of the compounds in the pure state or by use of the compounds in combination with a transparent organic polymer without particular non-linear optical properties.
