<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a DNA fragment comprising at 
least part of the sequence which is located upstream of 

the sequence coding for the "mature" fragment of the 
extracellular protein having an apparent molecular 

weight of 60 kDa from 
Lactococcus lactis
 strains, in 
particular from the 
Lactococcus lactis
 ssp 
Lactis
 strain 
MG 1363. 
Above DNA fragment may comprise one or two signal 
sequences coding for very effective signal peptides as 

well as a promotor sequence and a ribosome binding site 
sequence. These components of the DNA fragment in 

question may be either separately or jointly combined 
with a gene of a homologous or heterologous protein 

which then can be brought to expression via a host 
obtaining the desired extracellular homologous or 

heterologous protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates, inter alia, to DNA 
fragments which at least code for part of the extra-cellular 
protein having an apparent molecular weight of 
60 kDa from Lactococcus lactis strains such as the 
Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis strain MG1363. As is known, lactococci (Lactococcus lactis 
ssp. lactis and L.lactis ssp. cremoris) are used on a 
large scale as starter cultures in the preparation of 
dairy products such as cheese, butter and buttermilk. 
Recently, the complete nucleotide sequence of the genes 
for two extracellular proteins, i.e. proteinase prtP 
[Vos et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264 (1989b), 13579-13585; 
Kok et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 50 (1985), 94-101 
and De Vos et al., Gene 85 (1989), 169-176] and the 
bacteriocin nisin [Buchman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263 
(1988), 16260-16266] has been determined. The proteinase 
is synthesised as a pre-protein with a consensus ala/ala 
signal peptidase I cleavage site between the amino acid 
residues 33 and 34. It has been demonstrated that the 
signal peptide controls the secretion of heterologous 
proteins in lactic acid bacteria [Simons et al., 
Proceedings 2nd Netherlands Biotechnology Congress, 
(1988), 183-187]. The proteinase displays a significant 
sequence homology with a number of serine proteinases of 
the subtilisin family and also contains a C-terminal 
membrane anchor [Vos et al., 1989b loc.cit]. The gene for the bacteriocin nisin codes for a 
precursor polypeptide comprising 57 amino acids and 
having a molecular weight of 7500. A signal peptide  
 
comprising 23 amino acids is derived therefrom, which 
deviates from the consensus signal peptide rules as 
drawn up by Von Heijne, J. Mol. Biol. 184 (1985), 99-105. 
A series of post-translational modifications, 
including dehydration of serine and threonine residues 
and cross-linking with cysteine residues are required in 
order to obtain biologically active nisin. Partly in view of the above, the Applicant has 
attempted to gain more insight into the characteristics 
and the structure of extracellular proteins of lactococci. 
This study was carried out, in particular, to 
establish optimum conditions for obtaining extracellular 
proteins, in particular homologous and heterologous 
extracellular proteins with lactococci as host. The Applicant's study showed, as an unexpected 
result, that the Lactococcus strains involved in the 
study all secrete a protein with an apparent molecular 
weight of about 60 kDa, which was produced in relatively 
large amounts. This "60 kDa protein",
