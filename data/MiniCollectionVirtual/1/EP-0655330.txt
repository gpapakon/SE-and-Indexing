<ABSTRACT>
A plate loading device for a printing press (10) is disclosed. 
In the printing press (10), a plate cylinder (2) is rotatably 

supported in a housing. The device is arranged to replace 
a used plate (3;53) wound on a peripheral surface of the cylinder 

with a new plate (26;62) supplied through an entrance (14;55) 
formed in the 

housing. The device further includes retaining members (52) 
provided with the cylinder for holding end portions of the 

plate to be wound on the cylinder, and a cover (16) for 
selectively closing and opening the entrance in accordance 

with the loading and unloading of the plate. The device 
also has holding members (22;24) for holding the new plate at a 

predetermined position outside the cover when the cover is 
closed, and rollers (23;25) between the holding members and the 

cylinder (28;35) for clamping the new plate to be released from the 
holding members, and inserted through the entrance to be 

placed at a predetermined position in one of the retaining 
members so that the new plate is wound on the plate 

cylinder in one direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing press, and more 
particularly, to a plate loading device used for loading a 
plate in a predetermined position on a plate cylinder of the 
printing press. An offset press is typically constructed with three cylinders: 
a plate cylinder, a rubber blanket cylinder and an impression 
cylinder. In presses of this type, an inking system 
distributes ink and moisture to the plate cylinder which then 
transfers an ink image to the rubber blanket cylinder. The 
rubber blanket cylinder then transfers the image to a sheet 
of paper passing between the rubber blanket cylinder and the 
impression cylinder. For efficient printing press operation, it is important to be 
able to transfer the printing plates on and off of the plate 
cylinder as quickly as possible. Typically, plates are 
prepared in the vicinity of the plate cylinder while the 
printing press is running. When the press stops, the used  
 
plate is removed from the plate cylinder and replaced with a 
new plate. It is important that the new plate be easily and 
accurately loaded onto the plate cylinder during this 
operation. One method used to load a plate onto a plate 
cylinder is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 
284252/1992 entitled "Device for Loading Plate on Plate 
Cylinder". This method will be described with reference to Fig 5. In 
order to load a plate 53 onto the outer circumference of plate 
cylinder 51, as shown in Fig. 6, the plate cylinder 51 is 
equipped with a plate vice 52 for chucking the end portion of 
the plate 53. A housing 54, covering the plate cylinder 51 
or the like, is opened at an entrance 55 facing the outer 
circumference of the plate cylinder 51. The entrance 55 is 
closed by a cover 56, while the plate cylinder 51 is rotating. 
When plate cylinder 51 is stopped for replacing the plate 53, 
cover 56 opens to expose plate 53. Cover 56 attaches to a 
plate receiver 57, a plate holder 58, a plate guide 59 and a 
plate tensioner 61. According to the device described above, during the operation 
of the printing press, the entrance 55 is closed by the cover 
56. Plate 62 is next loaded on the plate cylinder 51 at a 
position determined by the plate holder 58 and the plate 
receiver 57.  When the printing operation is complete, plate 53 is thee 
replaced by another plate in the following manner. The cover 
56 is first lifted, as shown in Fig. 7, to open the entrance 
55. Then, the used plate mounted on the plate cylinder 51 is 
removed by opening the plate vice 52 and by

A plate loading device for a printing press, said device 
being arranged to replace a used plate wound on an outer 

peripheral surface of a plate cylinder rotatably supported in 
a housing with a new plate supplied through an entrance formed 

in the housing, said device including retaining members 
provided with the plate cylinder for holding end portions of 

the plate wound on the outer peripheral surface of the plate 
cylinder, a cover for selectively closing and opening the 

entrance in accordance with the loading and unloading of the 
plate, and holding members for holding the new plate to be 

replaced with the used plate at a predetermined position 
outside the cover when the cover is closed, said device 

characterized by that: 
   rollers interposed between said holding members and said 

plate cylinder for clamping the new plate to be released from 
said holding members, and inserted through the entrance to be 

placed at a predetermined position in one of said retaining 
members so that the new plate is wound on the plate cylinder 

in one direction. 
A loading device according to claim 1, 
   wherein each retaining member includes a plate vice fixed 

in said plate cylinder, a chuck incliningly connected to said 
plate vice; and pins for abutting against the end portion of 

the plate disposed between said plate vice and said chucks, 
 

for positioning said plate. 
A loading device according to claims 1 or 2, further 
comprising notches formed in the end portion of said plate for 

receiving said pins. 
A loading device according to anyone of the preceding 
claims, 

   wherein each holding member is disposed in said cover for 
holding the new plate substantially in a vertical position 

when said entrance is closed by said cover. 
A loading device according to claim 4, 
   wherein each holding member includes two rollers for 

receiving said plate supplied from the outside; and supports 
disposed above said rollers for supporting said new plate 

upright apart from said cover. 
A loading device according to claim 5, 
   wherein said cover has biasing members for biasing at 

least one of said rollers toward the other roller. 
A loading device according to claim 6, 
   wherein each biasing members include a pin disposed apart 

from said cover, a support arm ratable about said pin, a shaft 
mounted at one end of said arm and supporting said rollers 

thereon; and a spring mounted on the pin for biasing said 
 

support arm.
