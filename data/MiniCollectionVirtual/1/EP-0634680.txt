<ABSTRACT>
A stationary barrel (1) attached to a camera body (A), a 
lead barrel (3), a barrel (5) and a barrel (6) are moved out 

successively. A first lens frame (7) holding a first lens unit 
(7a) is held in the barrel (6) to be movable along the optical 

axis, and a second lens frame (8) holding a second lens unit 
(8a) is held in the barrel (5) to be movable along the optical 

axis. With this arrangement, the three movable barrels (3, 5, 
6) are all housed in the stationary barrel (1), and the total 

moving-out mount of the three movable barrels (3, 5, 6) is 
remarkably large compared to conventional arrangements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lens mechanism for a
camera.EP-A-0 344 806 discloses a zoom lens mechanism for a
camera, comprising a first barrel unit fixed to the camera; a
second barrel unit fitted inside said first barrel unit and
movable out therefrom; a third barrel unit fitted inside said
second barrel unit and movable out from said said second
barrel unit; a fourth barrel unit which is arranged so as to
be movable; a fifth barrel unit which is rotationally fixed
with reference to said first barrel unit and which is fitted
inside a movable barrel of said third barrel unit so as to be
axially movable straight along an optical axis at an equal
speed to that of said movable barrel of said third barrel
unit; a first and a second lens unit commonly defining said
optical axis, wherein said first lens unit being fitted
inside said fifth barrel unit while being held to be movable
along said optical axis, and said second lens unit being 
fitted inside said fourth barrel unit while being held also
to be movable along said optical axis; and a driving
mechanism for moving said second to fifth barrel units out
from said first barrel unit at the same time, wherein said
driving mechanism including a first and a second mechanism
provided for moving said first and second lens units and
powered and guided in common by the same relative rotational
movement of a movable barrel of said second or third barrel
units.EP-A-0 497 383 discloses to provide in a lens mechanism
comprising adjacent barrels which are movable relative to
each other and forming a gap therebetween, a light
intercepting member disposed in said gap and formed by
elastic material such as rubber.In particular, lens shutter cameras are widespread among
the general 
public because of their compactness and handiness. In recent
years, a demand for lens shutter cameras having higher functions
has been increasing, which has led to the development of a lens
shutter camera of a type provided with a zoom lens mechanism.Generally, a zoom lens mechanism includes a stationary
barrel fixed to the camera body, and a single or two movable
barrels fitted inside the stationary barrel. In the stationary
or the movable lens barrel, a first lens unit and a second lens
unit constituting a taking optical system are movably incorporated
through a lens driving mechanism using a cam. The focal
length is varied between the shortest and the longest focal
length conditions by increasing or decreasing the movement
amount of the movable barrel, and at least one of the first

<CLAIMS>
A lens barrel mechanism for a camera, comprising

a first lens unit (7a) and a second lens unit (8a)
arranged along a common optical axis;
a first barrel unit (1) which can be fixed to the camera
so as to be stationary;
a second barrel unit (2, 3) fitted inside said first
barrel unit (1) so as to be movable out from said first

barrel unit axially in a straight line along said optical
axis;
a third barrel unit (4, 5) fitted inside said second
barrel unit (2, 3) so as to be movable out from said second

barrel unit axially in a straight line along said optical
