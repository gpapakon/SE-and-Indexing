<ABSTRACT>
Ship modules (10,12) are fabricated in individual bays 
of fabrication buildings and then moved out of the 

buildings for attachment together to form the ship on 
water. This eliminates the need for large dry docks or 

launch areas. The modules (10,12) are floated and 
positioned such that the edges (14,16) to be joined are 

adjacent or abutting each other. A flexible strap (18) may 
then be positioned tightly against the joint exterior to 

prevent water entry or a floating structure may be 
positioned under the modules (10,12) such that a circular 

cross-section backing seals the joint to prevent water 
entry. The interior of the modules (10,12) is dewatered 

and the modules are then welded together. The modules 
(10,12) may alternatively be positioned adjacent each other 

above the waterline through the use of a barge and dry dock 
to eliminate the need for dewatering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
shipbuilding and particularly to the joining of separate
modules such as in building large ships.For centuries a typical large wooden ship was
constructed on a building ways under the supervision of a
master shipwright. The wooden parts were fabricated piece
by piece, and then fastened together on the building ways.Shipbuilding techniques that proved effective in
constructing wooden ships were often retained when wood was
replaced, first by iron and later by steel. The shipyard's
building ways was still the place where a highly skilled
work force assembled the ship, piece by piece. The keel
was laid first, followed by floors, frames, beams, decks,
and hull plating. Initially metal structural members were
joined together by riveting.Since about 1940 the construction of both commercial
and naval vessels has changed dramatically. These changes
may, in part, be attributed to the development of new
steels, the use of welded instead of riveted connections,
the increased use of aluminium, the advent of computer-aided
technology, construction orders for several identical
ships, and, above all, the need to improve productivity.
In conjunction with economic pressures, 
these changes have forced shipyards into developing a more
efficient assembly process -- one in which the flow of material,
the building of subassemblies, and the final fabrication of the
ship are merged to form a continuous process.A modern shipyard is predominately an assembly facility.
Subassemblies are joined together to form still larger modules,
which in turn form major sections of the hull. These modules are
then moved by large overhead cranes to various outfitting areas,
where machinery foundations, pipes and valves, ventilation
trunks, electrical cables, and various pieces of machinery are
installed.After as much of the outfitting as possible has been
completed, the modules, typically weighing several hundred tons,
are moved by gantry crane to the building dock or final assembly
area. Here the modules are joined ("spliced") together to form
a nearly complete ship. The long seams are then welded together
mechanically.Depending on the shipyard's arrangement and physical
facilities, the actual launching may be performed by a variety
of methods. A side or end launch may be performed from a
building ways. The ship may also be launched from either a
floating dry dock or a building dock, by flooding the dock until
the ship floats. Building docks are very expensive and generally
are used only for the

<CLAIMS>
A method of joining modules of ships, comprising:

a. floating and positioning the modules (10,12) adjacent
each other such that edges (14,16) of the modules (10,12)

to be joined are adjacent each other;
b. tightly positioning a flat flexible band (18) in flat
contact against the exterior of the joint formed by the

adjacent edges (14,16) such that water is eliminated
between the band (18) and the modules (10,12) and is

prevented from entering the joint from the exterior;
c. dewatering the interior of the adjacent modules
(10,12) at the adjacent edges (14,16); and
d. joining the adjacent modules (10,12) at the adjacent
edges (14,16) by welding on the interior of the modules

(10,12).
A method according to claim 1, wherein the flat
flexible band (18) is formed from a ceramic material.
A method of joining modules of ships, comprising:

a. floating and positioning the modules (10,12) adjacent
each other such that edges (14,16) of the modules (10,12)

to be joined are adjacent each other;
b. positioning a floating structure (28) having a top
covered with a flexible material (30) and a backing (32)

under the modules (10,12) such that the backing (32) is
aligned with and under the joint formed by the adjacent

edges (14,16);
c. deballasting the floating structure (28) to bring the 
backing (32) into sealing contact with the joint formed by

the adjacent edges (14,16);
d. dewatering the interior of the adjacent modules

e. joining the adjacent modules (10,12) at the adjacent
edges (14,16) by welding on the interior of the modules

A method according to claim 3, wherein the backing
(32) has a circular cross-section.
A method according to claim 3 or claim 4, including
the further step of lowering the floating structure (28) by

ballasting after the modules (10,12) have been welded
together.
