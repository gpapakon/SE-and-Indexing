<ABSTRACT>
A material for anti-ballistic body protection, which has at least one layer of a flat material, which contains an organic product which gives it dilatancy, in a single-layer or multilayer packet laminate. This flat material is particularly suitable for the trauma packet in the anti-ballistic packet. This flat material having a product which gives it dilatancy results in a considerable improvement in the anti-ballistic effect and particularly in a reduction in the trauma effect. The material according to the invention is used in particular for bullet-proof vests and fragment-proof vests and for equivalent helmets. The material according to the invention can also be used for impact-protection clothing (cladding).
