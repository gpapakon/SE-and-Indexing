<ABSTRACT>
An auto-lock slider, for a concealed slide 
fastener, comprises: a slider body (1) having a guide 

lug (2) having in its upper portion a locking-lever 
receiving groove (4) and a leaf-spring-receiving 

portion (7); a locking lever (3) received in the 
locking-lever-receiving groove (4), the locking lever 

(3) having at one end a locking claw (12) and at the 
other end an anchor portion (13); a horizontal U-shape 

leaf spring (6) covering the locking lever (3) 
at a side toward the anchor portion (13) in such a 

manner that the anchor portion (13) is pivotably held 
within the groove (4) and the locking claw (12) is 

resiliently urged to project into a coupling-element 
guide channel in the body (1). Since the number of 

of components of the slider is small, and the slider 
can be assembled simply.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an auto-lock slider
for a concealed slide fastener, and more particularly
to such an auto-lock slider in which a locking lever
with a locking claw and a leaf spring as a resilient
member are separate from each other and in which one
end of the locking lever and the leaf spring are
received in the upper portion of a guide lug of a
slider body.In a conventional auto-lock slider for a concealed
slide fastener, as shown in FIG. 9 of the accompanying
drawings, a slider body 30 has in the upper
portion of a guide lug 31 for guiding a locking lever
32, a vertical groove 33 for receiving the locking lever
32, and the guide lug 31 has in its front portion a
hole 35 in which a coil spring 34 is received. The
coil spring 34 is pressed against a rear end of the
locking lever 32. The locking lever 32 is pivotally
mounted at its center and has at its front end a
locking claw 36 in the base of which a pintle 37 of
a pull tab is inserted so that the locking claw 36 of
the locking lever 32 can pivotally move vertically.In another conventional auto-lock slider (Republic 
of China Patent Publication No. 20633), as shown
in FIG. 10, a slider body 41 has in the upper portion
of a guide lug 42 a vertical groove 44 for receiving
a generally M-shape locking lever 43, and the
guide lug 42 has in its center a hole 46 in which a
coil spring 45 is received. The coil spring 45 is held
in the hole 46 by clinching the upper end of the
hole 46 in such a manner that the coil spring 45 is
pressed against a central recess of the M shape of the
locking lever 43. A pintle 48 of a pull tab is inserted
in the base of a locking claw 47 of the locking
lever 43 so that the locking claw 47 can pivotally move
vertically.In assembling of the first-named conventional
auto-lock slider, firstly the coil spring 34 is
received in the hole 35 and then the locking lever 32
is inserted into the vertical groove 33 with the rear
end pressed downwardly until a pivot hole 38 of the
locking lever 32 is aligned with pivot holes 39 of the
guide lug 31, whereupon a hollow pivot 40 is inserted
through the pivot holes 38, 39 and is then clinched
at opposite ends. Partly since the aligning of the
pivot holes and the clinching of the hollow pivot
require complex works, and partly since the number of
components of the slider is large, an inexpensive
slider could not be obtained.With the second-named conventional auto-lock 
slider, since the locking lever 43 is held in position
simply by pressing its center with the coil spring,
the

<CLAIMS>
An auto-lock slider, for a concealed slide fastener, comprising:

(a) a slider body (1) having a guide lug (2) having in its
upper portion a locking-lever-receiving groove (4) and a leaf-spring-receiving

portion (7);
(b) a locking lever (3) received vertically in the locking-lever-receiving
groove (4) and having at one end a locking claw

(12) and at the other end an anchor portion (13);
(c) a leaf spring (6) having a plate (17; 20), a downwardly
extending resilient strip (19; 21) and a pair of side arms (18;

22) projecting centrally from opposite sides of the plate; and
(d) a pull tab connector (15);
characterised
 in that

the leaf spring (6) has a shape such that one end is deformable
to a more extent compared to the other end, the leaf

spring (6) covering the locking lever (3) at a side toward the
anchor portion (13) in such a manner that the anchor portion

(13) is pivotably held within the groove (4) and the locking
claw (12) is resiliently urged to project into the body (1),

the leaf spring (6) being resiliently in contact with the locking
lever (3) with the more deformable end facing toward the

locking claw (12),
the leaf-spring-receiving portion (7) has front and rear
holding projections (8) spaced from one another and projecting

from respective upper surfaces of opposite side walls of the
locking-lever-receiving groove (4),
flat portions (9) are provided between the holding projections
(8);
the plate (17; 20) of the leaf spring (6) is held in position 
by inserting the side arms (18; 22) between the front and

rear holding projections (8) and then clinching the front and
rear holding projections (8) over the side arms (18; 22); and
the pull tab connector (15) has a pintle (16) inserted in a
base of the locking claw (12).
The auto-lock slider according to claim 1, wherein the leaf
spring (6) has a horizontal U shape composed of a wide upper

plate (17) and a narrow resilient strip (19) extending downwardly
from the upper plate (17), the upper plate (17) having

the pair of side arms (18) projecting centrally from opposite
sides of the upper plate (17), wherein the resilient strip (19)

is pressed against an upper surface of the locking lever (3).
The auto-lock slider according to claim 1, wherein the leaf
spring (6) has a main plate (20) having at its center a resilient

strip (21) punched out by a longitudinally elongated horizontal
U-shape cut and bent downwardly, the main plate (20)

having the pair of side arms (22) projecting centrally from opposite
sides of the main plate (20), wherein the resilient

strip (21) is pressed against an upper surface of the locking
lever (3).
