<ABSTRACT>
Hybridomas (termed "UIC2 hybridoma", ATCC Accession No. HB11207 and "UIC2/A hybridoma", ATCC Accession No. HB11287) producing monoclonal antibody (termed "UIC2 mAb") directed against an extracellular domain of a cell surface P-glycoprotein antigen associated with multidrug resistance in primate cells was produced by fusing a human myeloma cell with a spleen cell derived from a Balb/c mouse immunized with syngeneic 3T3 fibroblasts previously transfected with the isolated human mdr1 cDNA. UIC2 mAb, thus produced, as well as fragments and recombinant derivatives thereof, may be used to detect and isolate multidrug resistant primate cells and human mdr1 gene products, and to reverse multidrug resistance in primate cells, including cells of multidrug resistant human tumors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with government support
under research grant CA40333 awarded by the National
Institutes of Health. The government has certain
rights in this invention. This is a continuation-in-part
of U.S. Serial No. 854,881, filed March 20, 1992.The present invention relates to a hybridoma that
produces monoclonal antibodies specific to a cell
surface antigen associated with multidrug resistance in
human cells, and uses of such antibodies and their
fragments or recombinant derivatives.Many human cancers express intrinsically or
develop spontaneously resistance to several classes of
anticancer drugs, each with a different structure and
different mechanism of action. This phenomenon, which
can be mimicked in cultured mammalian cells selected
for resistance to certain plant alkaloids or antitumor
antibiotics such as colchicine, vinblastine and
doxorubicin (former generic name is adriamycin), is
generally referred to as multidrug resistance ("MDR").1
This MDR phenotype presents a major obstacle to
successful cancer chemotherapy in human patients. MDR, in most cases, appears to result from
decreased intracellular accumulation of drug as the
result of increased drug efflux related to alterations
in a plasma membrane mechanism. When mutant cell lines
expressing MDR are isolated, they are seen to express
an ATP-dependent pump mechanism located in the plasma
membrane that keeps the intracellular accumulation of
an anti-cancer drug low. This mechanism consists of
active extrusion of the drug, which had originally
entered through the plasma membrane.The gene encoding this pump system, sometimes
referred to as the multidrug transporter, has been
cloned from cultured human cells by Roninson et al.
(see reference 12 below), and is generally referred to
as mdr1 or MDR1.1 This gene is expressed in several
classes of normal tissues1, but physiological substrates
transported for the mdr1 gene product in these tissues
have not been identified.The protein product of the mdr1 gene, generally
known as P-glycoprotein ("P-170", "Pgp"), is a 170 kDa
trans-plasma membrane protein that constitutes the
aforementioned energy-dependent efflux pump.
Expression of Pgp on the cell surface is sufficient to
render cells resistant to multiple cytotoxic drugs,
including many anti-cancer agents. Pgp-mediated MDR
appears to be an important clinical component of tumor
resistance in tumors of different types, and mdr1 gene
expression correlates with resistance to chemotherapy
in different types of cancer.Sequence analysis of the mdr1
