<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTI-CAVITY CHEWING GUM AND METHOD USING ERYTHROSEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for preventing or reducing dental caries wherein the carbohydrate erythrose is employed in chewing gum to inhibit growth of Streptococcus mutans ("S. mutans") in the mouth. The present invention also relates to chewing gum formulations containing erythrose. Foods containing natural sugars such as sucrose and dextrose have long been recognized as a major contributing cause of dental caries. The sugars are easily utilizable sources of nutrition for bacteria, specifically S. mutans found in the mouth. This bacteria is also responsible for the formation of plaque. S. mutans ferments residual sugar, thereby producing acids that dissolve the minerals of the teeth.In recent years, certain anti-cariogenic substances have been incorporated into chewing gum and other orally-usable products. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,390,523, issued June 28, 1983, to Huchette et al. , teaches the substitution of sorbose for sucrose as a sweetener in chewing gum in order to reduce the production of fermentation acids in the mouth.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,457,921, issued July 3, 1984, and 4,508,713 issued April 2, 1985, both to Stroz et al. , teach a method for treating teeth with hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, in conjunction with sucrose, in a chewing gum composition, in order to reduce dental caries.U.S. Patent No. 4,374,122, issued February 15, 1983, also to Stroz et al., teaches the use of a 

compound comprising 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-l,2,3- oxathiazine-4-one-2,2-dioxide, or the sodium, ammonium, potassium or calcium salts thereof, in an orally-usable carrier, including chewing gum, in order to reduce dental caries.U.S. Patent No. 4,518,581, issued May 21, 1985, to Miyake et al., teaches the use of a substance selected from the group consisting of isomaltosyl mono-, di- and tri-glucoses, and reduction products thereof, in orally-usable products including chewing gum in order to reduce dental caries.U.S. Patent No. 4,714,612, issued December 22, 1987, to Nakamura et al., teaches the use of γ-globulin in chewing gum to combat Bacteroides inσivalis from colonizing in the mouth.European Patent Application 0 342 369 A2, filed by Lembke et al. and published November 23, 1989, in the name of Biodyn AG, teaches the use of galactose in numerous orally-usable products, including chewing gum, in order to protect against dental caries.In U.S Patent No. 3,429,716, issued February 25, 1969, to Andrews, erythrose is used to retard

<CLAIMS>
I CLAIM:
1. A chewing gum formulation comprising
(a) a water soluble bulk portion, which comprises from about 5 to about 90% by weight of the gum of bulk sweeteners, and from about 0.01 to about 15% softeners;
(b) from about 5 to about 95% by weight of the gum of a water insoluble chewing gum base portion; and (c) from about 0.1 to about 15% by weight of the gum of water insoluble flavor ingredients; the water soluble bulk portion comprising sufficient erythrose to give the chewing gum anti- caries properties.
2. The chewing gum as set forth in Claim 1 wherein the chewing gum comprises at least about 2.0% erythrose by weight.
3. The chewing gum as set forth in Claim 1 wherein the chewing gum comprises from about 2.5 to about 40% erythrose by weight.
4. The chewing gum as set forth in Claim 1 wherein the chewing gum comprises from about 3 to about 35% erythrose by weight.
5. The chewing gum as set forth in Claim 1 wherein the chewing gum comprises from about 5 to about 30% erythrose by weight.
6. A method of reducing or preventing dental caries by inhibiting growth of Streptococcus mutans in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates in the mouth, which method comprises contacting the teeth with chewing gum containing erythrose, wherein the erythrose 


is present in quantity sufficient to give the chewing gum anti-caries properties.
7. The method in Claim 6 wherein the chewing gum contains at least about 2.0% erythrose by weight.
8. The method in Claim 6 wherein the chewing gum contains from about 2.5 to about 40% erythrose by weight.
9. The method in Claim 6 wherein the chewing gum contains from about 3 to about 35% erythrose by weight.
10. The method in Claim 6 wherein the chewing gum contains from about 5 to about 30% erythrose by weight.
