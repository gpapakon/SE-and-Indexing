1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoxalines corresponding to general formula I:


in which one of the substituents R
1
 and R
2
 is a nitro group while the other is
hydrogen, an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group

containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R
3
 and R
4
 independently of one another
represent a -(CH
2
-CHR
7
-O)
n
H group where R
7
 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl
and n = 0 or an integer of 1 to 4, with the proviso that, in at least one of the

substituents R
3
 and R
4
, n is not 0, and R
5
 and R
6
 independently of one
another represent hydrogen or an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms,

and salts thereof.
1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinoxalines corresponding to formula I and salts
thereof as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that R
1
 is a nitro group and, in
the substituents R
3
 and R
4
, n = 0 or 1 and R
7
 represents hydrogen or
preferably methyl, with the provis
o that, in at least one of the substituents R
3

and R
4
, n is not 0.
The use of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines corresponding to formula I
or salts thereof for colouring fibres of natural origin or synthetic fibres.
The use of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines corresponding to formula I
or salts thereof as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that R
1
 is a nitro group
and, in the substituents R
3
 and R
4
, n = 0 or 1 and R
7
 represents hydrogen or
preferably methyl, with the proviso that, in at least one of the substituents R
3

and R
4
, n is not 0.
The use of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalines corresponding to formula I 
or salts thereof for colouring polyacrylonitrile fibres and keratin fibres,

preferably human hair.
Hair colorants containing dyes corresponding to formula I or salts
thereof in a quantity of 0.01 to 5% by weight and preferably in a quantity of

0.1 to 2% by weight, based on the hair colorant as a whole, and a water-containing
carrier.
