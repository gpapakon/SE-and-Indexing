<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing polysuccinimide and
polyaspartic acid, salts thereof and the amide

thereof by polymerization of maleic anhydride,
aspartic acid, maleic acid or fumaric acid at from

150째C to 300째C in a solvent, optionally in the presence
of ammonia, and optional hydrolysis of the

polysuccinimide obtained to polyaspartic acid or a
salt thereof, characterized in that the solvent is

water, an alcohol or an organic, polar, aprotic
solvent.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the polymerization is carried out with a residence

time of from 5 to 300 minutes.
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that in the preparation of

polyaspartic acid the molar ratio of maleic
anhydride, maleic acid or fumaric acid to ammonia is

between 1:0.8 and 1:1.2.
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that in the preparation of

polyaspartamide the molar ratio to ammonia is, in
the case of maleic anhydride, maleic acid or fumaric

acid, between 1:1.8 and 1:2.4, and in the case of
aspartic acid is between 1:0.8 and 1:1.2. 
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the reaction is

carried out at a pressure from 2 to 70 bar.
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the reaction is

carried out at from 180째C to 220째C.
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the reaction is

carried out continuously.
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that bases are added prior

to or after the polymerization.
Process according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the solvent used is

water.
