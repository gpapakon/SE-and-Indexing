<ABSTRACT>
Process for pyrolytic destruction of gases such as especially air containing solvents and volatile compounds, characterised in that the polluted air corresponding to the dilution air needed for the regeneration of filter casings containing active carbon, undergoes a multistage treatment:   - a first gaseous stream containing the compounds in suspension to be destroyed is channelled into a preheating unit (24); - it is intimately mixed with an unpolluted second gaseous stream constituting an external make-up; - these two streams are added together and recycled into a solvent trap (2) in order to improve the efficiency of the desorption reaction; - this stream, containing all of the components in suspension, next undergoes a new preheating (25) more intensive than the preceding one, in order that the pyrolytic oxidation reaction should be complete; - the gaseous stream devoid of harmful particles is cooled before being discharged into the environment.
