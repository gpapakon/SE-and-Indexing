<ABSTRACT>
What is proposed is a device for splitting up cylindrical pressed articles (13) which are of any length, that is to say are very short or also extremely long, and which consist of stalk material, such as hay or straw, or other materials along their longitudinal axis, which device consists of a frame (1, 2) carrying and guiding the pressed article, of a preferably non-driven splitting knife (3) fastened to the frame and of elements (4, 5, 6, 7) for generating the advancing movement and for transmitting the latter to the pressed article. As a result of the combination of the simple and robust design of such a device and of a high throughput capacity achievable by means of the continuous mode of operation, an economically advantageous splitting-up of even highly compacted pressed articles is possible.

Device for ripping open cylindrical pressings (13) made
of stalk material, such as hay or straw, or other

materials along their longitudinal axis, the said device
consisting of a stand (1) carrying the pressing (13), a

ripping knife (3) disposed on the said stand, and also
elements (4-10; 15, 16, 17; 18, 19, 20; 21; 22) for

generating and transmitting a relative movement between
the ripping knife (3) and the pressing (13),


characterised in that
 the stand (1) carries a bale guide
(2) for a pressing (13) of any desired length, which

pressing is axially advanced continuously or quasi-continuously
in the lying-down condition by the elements

which can be driven hydraulically, electrically or
mechanically and are constructed as entrainment elements

(8; 15; 18; 21; 22), is fed in the longitudinal direction
to the ripping knife (3) which projects with a selectable

cutting depth in a stationary manner in the path of
advance of the pressing (13), and is ripped up by the

latter.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
entrainment elements (8) are formed by one or more

toothed thrust rods which are connected, via angularly
moving links (9), to guide rods (7) which can be set in

oscillating motion via one or more hydraulic cylinders
(4) and a suitable control system.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
entrainment elements (15) are formed by one or more

toothed coupling members of a four-joint transmission,
the crank (17) of which can be driven hydraulically,

mechanically or electrically.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
entrainment elements (18) are one or more sets of toothed

coupling members which are mounted, in pairs with a 90
degree offset, on two crankshafts (19) of which one 

crankshaft (19) in each case can be driven hydraulically,
mechanically or electrically.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
entrainment elements are one or more toothed discs (21)

which can be hydraulically, mechanically or electrically
driven.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
entrainment elements are one or more circulating chains

(22) with entrainment prongs, which chains can be
hydraulically, mechanically or elect
rically driven.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that,
 on the pressings feed side, the
entrainment elements (8; 15; 18; 21; 22) are so

constructed, in length and shape, that they grip the
succeeding pressing (13) from above, from below, from one

side or even axially and convey it onwards, in order to
ensure automatic operation.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the entrainment elements (8; 15;
18) are disposed opposite one another on both sides of

the ripping knife (3) and are so constructed that the
pressing forces exerted by the said elements on the

pressing (13) neutralize each other.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that,
 for the purpose of emptying the
device of residues, the ripping knife (3) can be easily

demounted or folded out of the path of advance of the
pressing (13).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 a single entrainment element (8; 
15; 18; 21; 22) is provided for advancing the

pressing (13).
