<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to detect faults better and, if necessary, to be able to remove them, the signal path leading from a current value sensor (25) of the device (21) to be monitored and to the evaluation device (30) is separated into at least two parallel signal paths (P, I), which process in a different manner the output signals from the current value sensor or signals derived therefrom.

An electrical monitoring arrangement comprising an actual 
value sensor (S6, S8) which senses an actual value of the 

apparatus to be monitored and signal paths (P, I) along which 
signals corresponding to the actual value pass to evaluating 

devices which evaluate the signals, characterised in that the 
signals pass by way of at least two parallel signal paths (P, 

I) to at least one evaluating device (30), that the signal 
paths (P, I) have different processing units (28, 29) which 

process the signals in parallel, and that at least one 
evaluating device (30) compares and evaluates the differently 

processed signals. 
A monitoring arrangement according to claim 1 
characterised in that one signal path (P) effects digital 

signal processing and the other signal path (I) effects analog 
signal processing and the signal paths conduct digital signals 

(P
1
,P
2
 ..) on the one hand and analog signals (I
1
, I
2
, ..) on 
the other hand respectively. 
A monitoring arrangement according to claim 2 
characterised in that a counter (T
d
) counts digital signals 
(P
1
, P
2
, ..) which are dependent on speed of rotation and an 
analog/digital converter (A/D) converts analog signals (I
1
, I
2
, 
..) which are dependent on speed of rotation into digital 

signals. 
A monitoring arrangement according to claim 2 or claim 3 
characterised in that an RC-arrangement branches off the 

signal path (P) for the digital signals (P
1
, P
2
, ..), converts 
the digital signals (P
1
, P
2
, ..) into analog signals (I
1
, I
2
,..)  
 

by integration and feeds them into the signal path (I) for the 
analog signals (I
1
, I
2
, ..). 
A monitoring arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that the actual value sensor 

(S6, S8) effects optical scanning of a ring which has light 
and dark regions of equal width and which rotates at the speed 

of rotation and the output signals of the actual value sensor 
(S6, S8) are differentiated so that a pulse of constant pulse 

width is produced at each edge of the brightness signals. 
A monitoring arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 
4 characterised in that a Hall probe serves as the actual 

value sensor (S6, S8). 
A monitoring arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that, if the value in 

respect of the speed of rotation which is produced from the 
analog signals (I
1
, I
2
) is not the same as the value in respect 
of the speed of rotation which is produced from the digital 

signals (P
1
, P
2
, ..), the value of the analog signals (I
1
, I
2
) 
serves as the true value in respect of the speed of rotation 

when the digital signals (P
1
, P
2
, ..) give a higher value than 
the analog signals (I
1
, I
2
, ..). 
A monitoring arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims characterised in that fault shut-down occurs 

when a value in respect of the speed of rotation which is 
produced by way of one signal path is zero while the value in 

respect of the speed of rotation which is produced by way of 
the other signal path is different from zero.  

 
Use of the monitoring arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims in a control device (2) for burners of 

heating installations and the like on the condition that an 
actual value sensor (S6) is in the form of a rotary speed 

sensor of a drive unit (D6) for the oil pump (6) and a further 
actual value sensor (S8) is in the form of a rotary speed 

sensor of a second drive unit (D8) for the blower (8), the 
second drive unit being separate from the first drive unit 

(D6). 
Use of a monitoring arrangement according to claim 9 
characterised by integration into a control device (2) which 

provides for pulse width-modulated control of the drive units 
(D6, D8), on the condition that the monitoring arrangement is 

used for regulating pulse width-modulated control signals (C6, 
C8) for the drive units (D6, D8). 
Use according to claim 9 or claim 10 on the condition 
that with different values in respect of speed of rotation for 

the blower (8) between the digital signal path (P) and the 
analog signal path (I) the lower value in respect of speed of 

rotation serves as the true value. 
Use according to one of claims 9 - 11 on the condition 
that with different values with respect to speed of rotation 

for the oil pump (6) between the digital signal path (P) and 
the analog signal path (I) the higher value in respect of 

speed of rotation serves as the true value. 
Use according to claim 11 or claim 12 on the condition 
that fault shut-down occurs when a predetermined difference 

between the values in respect of speed of rotation of the two 
signal paths (P, I) is exceeded.
