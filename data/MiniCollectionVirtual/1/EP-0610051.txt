<ABSTRACT>
A rib diffuser is provided which comprises a first 
row of low ribs (42) with relatively small height 

extending into regions of very low flow angle and a row of 
high ribs (50) located behind the leading edge of the 

first row of ribs (42). The high ribs (50) extend further 
into the region of the low flow angle and accept the 

connected flow from the low ribs (42) as well as 
additional low angle flow not corrected by the low ribs 

(42).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to diffusers for centrifugal
compressors. In one aspect, it relates to such a diffuser
with ribs.In a high specific speed centrifugal compressor with
a vaneless diffuser, there is significant nonuniformity of
the flow at the impeller exit in the passage defined by
the vaneless diffusers. For radial discharge impellers,
where the flow leaves the impeller 90° to the impeller
axis in the meridional plane, this nonuniformity is
generally characterized by a large region of low radial
velocity and low angle flow, relative to the tangential,
near the shroud side of the passage. There can also be a
small amount of nonuniformity near the hub side. For
mixed flow impellers, where the flow leaves the impeller
at less than 90° to the impeller axis in the meridional
plane, there is generally a redistribution of the
nonuniformity in the direction of reducing the severity
and extent of the nonuniformity near the shroud side of
the passage and increasing the nonuniformity near the hub
side.There are several penalties associated with these
flow nonuniformities if they are allowed to go unchecked.
A low radial velocity fluid near the side walls of the
vaneless diffuser will quickly be brought to rest and then
pushed in towards the impeller by the increasing pressures
within the diffuser. Thus, part of the flow is pushed
back into the impeller where it has to be reprocessed.
This leads to increased impeller work and decreased stage
efficiencies. In addition, this reverse flow effectively
blocks the passage in the vaneless diffuser, so that flow
diffusion is diminished and efficiency suffers. The
continued nonuniformity in the vaneless diffuser reduces
the effectiveness and efficiency of the vaneless diffuser
and downstream components. The purpose of a rib diffuser is to correct the
nonuniformity at the impeller tip by placing stationary
ribs as near as practical to the impeller tip and only in
regions having sufficiently low angle flow. This
configuration avoids the problems associated with full
vane diffusers which have vanes in the parts of the flow
not requiring correction thus creating frictional and wake
losses. Existing ideas attempt to correct the
nonuniformity at the impeller tip by fixing a single row
of ribs on the diffuser wall that extends across the
complete region of low angle flow. The region of
nonuniformity can be a significant percentage of the
passage width at the impeller tip, and the flow angles can
vary significantly over this region, up to 20°-30°.
Consequently, a single row
