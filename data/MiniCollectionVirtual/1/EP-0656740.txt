<ABSTRACT>
The electrical resistor (element) (4) comprises a metallic outer tube (7) covered by a coating (9, 9a, 9b) of metal or alloy having the properties of being compatible with foodstuffs, of being resistant to organic acids, of avoiding adhesion of the scale deposit resulting from heating water, of being capable of being arranged in highly homogeneous, very thin layers exhibiting substantially no surface porosity and of exhibiting a high ductility in order to be able to withstand the thermal cycles within the range of intended operating temperatures, as well as stability in the intended temperature range.

An electric heating resistance (4) for a container 
(1) intended to receive water for heating, particularly 

a kettle, said resistance (4) comprising an outer metal 
tube (7) coated with a metal or alloy coating (9) 

having the properties of being compatible with the 
supply, resisting oxidation and corrosion by hot water 

and organic acids and preventing adhesion of the scale 
deposit resulting from the heating of the water, said 

coating (9, 9a, 9b) also having the following 
characteristics: 


the ability to be deposited in very thin very 
homogeneous layers having substantially no surface 

porosity; 
high ductility so as to withstand the thermal 
cycles throughout the range of intended operating 

temperatures; 
unchangeability throughout the range of intended 
temperatures, 
 
characterised in that the said coating is formed by a 

metal layer (9a) and an outer layer of gold (9b). 
An electric resistance according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the thickness of the gold layer 

is at least equal to 0.1 µm. 
An electric resistance according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the metal layer (9a) is silver.  

 
An electric resistance according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the silver layer (9a) has a 

thickness of between 2 and 15 µm, preferably between 6 
and 8 µm. 
An electric resistance according to claim 3, 
characterised in that an interface layer (9c) of 

palladium is intercalated between the layer of silver 
(9a) and the layer of gold (9b). 
An electric resistance according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the coating (9, 

9a, 9b, 9c) is obtained by electrolytic and/or chemical 
deposition. 
An electric kettle comprising an electric 
resistance according to any one of claims 1 to 6. 
An electric kettle according to claim 7, 
characterised in that it comprises a filter (10) 

adapted to retain the lime particles capable of forming 
on the heating of the water. 
An electric kettle according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the resistance (4) is brazed on 

the flange (6) by means of a silver-based brazing 
compound.
