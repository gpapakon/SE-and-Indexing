<ABSTRACT>
A topsheet for an absorbent article which has an uneven profile formed on a
surface thereof to be brought into contact with a wearer's skin, the uneven profile being

flexibly deformable in conformity to the contour of the wearer's body and to the
wearer's movement, and depressions of the uneven profile being capable of trapping

high-viscosity excreta thereby separating the high-viscosity excreta from the wearer's
skin while an absorbent article having the topsheet is worn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a topsheet for absorbent articles such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, and incontinence pads.Topsheets that have been used in absorbent articles, such as disposable diapers and sanitary napkins, include nonwoven fabrics prepared by various methods, perforated nonwoven fabrics, and perforated films of organic resins such as polyethylene.Characteristics primarily required of absorbent articles include absorption characteristics relating to absorbing performance and surface characteristics for giving no adverse influences to the wearer's skin, such as an itch and a rash.Conventional topsheets have satisfied the requirements for the absorption characteristics to some extent in letting low-viscosity waste liquids pass through and be absorbed quickly by an absorbent member lying under the topsheet but still leave room for improvement on the properties of making high-viscosity waste matter pass through and be absorbed. With respect to the surface characteristics for having no adverse influences on the skin, further improvements have been desired for alleviating skin irritation.Skin troubles by absorbent articles are assumed attributed to the following causes. An absorbent article, while worn, creates an internal environment in which the skin is apt to be hydrated and swollen because of temperature and humidity rises, adhesion and remaining of the waste, e.g., urine or blood, and the like. The skin in such a condition is readily susceptible to physical irritation, i.e., the friction of the topsheet against the skin, and chemical irritation, namely, percutaneous absorption of irritants such as urine, soft stools or blood, resulting in skin troubles. It seems that the physical irritation is largely dependent on the surface characteristics of the topsheet with which the wearer's skin is in direct contact, and the chemical irritation is ascribable chiefly to high-viscosity waste that is less absorbable and likely to remain on the topsheet.Under these circumstances, studies have been made to develop a topsheet for absorbent articles which feels soft.JP-W-10-502000 (unexamined published international patent application) discloses a topsheet having a large number of protrusions extending along its longitudinal direction to have a wavy profile. The protrusions extending in the longitudinal direction contribute to soft feel but fail to retain their shape, being easily collapsed under the pressure while worn. More specifically, because the protrusions have a protuberant
