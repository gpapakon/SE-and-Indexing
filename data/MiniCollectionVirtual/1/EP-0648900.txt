<ABSTRACT>
Hydraulic apparatus for construction machinery has 
an actuator (1), such as a piston and cylinder for 

operating the machinery and a control device (16) with a 
manual lever (7) usable by an operator to cause fluid to 

flow to and from the actuator (1) via a switching unit 
(3) installed between a pump (2) and a storage tank (13). 
An inflow variable restriction valve (4) is 
located between the pump (2) and the switching unit 

(3).The restriction action of the valve (4) is controlled 
in accordance with the operation of the lever (7). An 

outflow variable restrictor valve (26) is installed 
between the tank (13) and the actuator (1) and 

Pressure difference control means controls the difference 
in pressure between the inlet and exit ports of said 

inflow variable restriction valve (4). The restriction 
areas of said inflow and outflow variable restriction 

valves (4,26) are controlled independently and said 
outflow variable restriction valve (26) is controlled in 

accordance with fluctuations in the pressure of an inlet 
chamber of the actuator (1) thereby preventing the 

occurrence of cavitation whilst still ensuring the 
desirable control characteristic that the actuator drive 

speed corresponds to the operation of the lever (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydraulic apparatus or device for use in 
construction machinery. A typical hydraulic shovel is comprised of an arm, a boom, a hydraulic cylinder for driving a 
bucket, an actuator such as a hydraulic motor, and an operating lever for an operator to control the 
above, wherein hydraulic fluid is supplied to the actuator in accordance with the operation of the 
operating lever to thereby drive the actuator. In such devices, a directional control valve is usually 
installed between the actuator and the hydraulic pump as means for changing the operating direction 
of the actuator. This directional control valve is switched, thereby switching the direction of the flow 
of hydraulic fluid through the actuator, in accordance with the direction of operation of the operating 
lever. In these kinds of hydraulic devices, the employment of a so-called load sensing system is 
commonly known. This system works such that the supply of hydraulic fluid to the actuator is in 
accordance with the degree of operation of the operating lever regardless of the load on the actuator 
thereby achieving a actuator drive speed which corresponds to the degree of operation of the 
operating lever. In this load sensing system, the position of the spool of the directional control valve is 
typically changed in proportion to the degree of operation of the operating lever, such that the opening 
area of the directional control valve is changed in proportion to the degree of operation of the 
operating lever. Furthermore, a pressure compensator comprising for example a pressure 
compensator valve is also provided such that the pressure difference between hydraulic pressure on 
the exit port side of the directional valve which is linked to the inlet chamber of the actuator, 
(equivalent to the load pressure on the actuator) and the hydraulic pressure on the inlet port side of 
the directional control valve is controlled to a predetermined value. thereby ensuring that the amount 
of flow of fluid through the actuator is in proportion to the opening area and therefore in proportion to 
the degree of operation of the operating lever. By using this kind of load sensing system, even if the load on the actuator changes during 
operation, a flow of hydraulic fluid corresponding to the degree of operation of the operating lever is 
supplied to the actuator, therefore making it possible to achieve an actuator drive speed corresponding 
to the degree of operation of the operating lever and hence the controllability of the
