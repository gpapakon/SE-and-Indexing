<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for the printing of a set of consecutive original pages (28,28') on
a number of receiving sheets, wherein in a first printing mode in each case one page is

printed on each side of a receiving sheet, and in a second printing mode two pages are
printed next to one another on each side of a receiving sheet, and the receiving sheets

are then double-folded (11). In the first printing mode, the first receiving sheet to be printed
is the sheet that forms the front of the set of prints.


For the printing of a set of original sheets (28) formed as a booklet, the first sheet to be
printed is the receiving sheet which forms the centre of the booklet and the last sheet to

be printed is the receiving sheet which forms the outside of the booklet.

In the case of printing receiving sheets on both sides, in the first printing mode in each

case first a predetermined side of a receiving sheet is printed and in the second printing
mode in each case first a receiving sheet is printed on the side corresponding to the

predetermined side in the first printing mode.

Control means set the printing apparatus automatically to the second printing mode

when the printing apparatus for making a booklet is set solely to double-folding and
possibly stapling of the double-folded printed set of receiving sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of printing a set of consecutive original pages
on a number of receiving sheets, either in a first printing mode in which in each case
one page is printed on each side of a receiving sheet, or in a second printing mode in
which two pages can be printed next to one another on each side of a receiving sheet
and the receiving sheets are then double-folded to form a booklet.A method of this kind is known from Xerox Disclosure Journal, July/August 1987,
No. 4, pp. 179-180.According to this known method, in the second printing mode for forming a booklet the
first receiving sheet printed is the one which carries the first page of the required
booklet. For a 12-page booklet the twelfth original page together with the first original
page is printed first on a receiving sheet. In the case of automatic feed of original
sheets from the bottom of a stack of original sheets, the originals are situated with
pages numbers 1 and 12 at the bottom.As a result of the increasing availability of printing apparatus with which folded booklets
can be made, there will also be an increasing demand for making a copy of such a
booklet. In order to use the above-mentioned known apparatus for this purpose, the
folded booklet must be unfolded so that it can be put in in the form of a stack of original
sheets. One disadvantage in this connection is that it is difficult to press the unfolded
booklet flat, so that the sides of the booklet with the first page at the bottom project up
and render separation of the original sheets difficult.The object of the invention is to provide a method without this disadvantage.
To this end, in a method according to the preamble, for the purpose of printing a set of
consecutive original sheets in the first printing mode, the first receiving sheet to be
printed is the sheet that will form the front of the set, and therefore contains the first
page, and for the purpose of printing a set of original sheets formed as a booklet the first
receiving sheet to be printed is the sheet that forms the centre of the booklet and the
last to be printed is the receiving sheet which forms the outside of the booklet, and
therefore contains the first page.As a result, for the method of copying a booklet to form a booklet, use can be made of a
printing apparatus in which original sheets of an unfolded booklet can be reliably 
separated from the bottom of a stack, i.e. when said originals are situated with their fold
line transversely of the feed direction of the originals.Preferably, in

<CLAIMS>
A method of printing a set of consecutive original pages (28, 28') on a number
of receiving sheets, either in a first printing mode (Fig. 2) in which in each case one

page is printed on each side of a receiving sheet, or in a second printing mode (Fig. 3)
in which two pages can be printed next to one another on each side of the receiving

sheet and the receiving sheets are then double-folded (11) to form a booklet,
characterised in that for the purpose of printing a set of consecutive original sheets (28)

in the first printing mode, the first receiving sheet to be printed is the sheet that will form
the front of the set of prints, and therefore contains the first page, and that for the

purpose of printing a set of original sheets (28') formed as a booklet the first receiving
sheet to be printed is the sheet that forms the centre of the booklet and the last to be

printed is the receiving sheet which forms the outside of the booklet, and therefore
contains the first page.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that in the case of the printing
of receiving sheets on both sides in the first printing mode in each case first a

predetermined side of a receiving sheet is printed and only then is the other side of said
receiving sheet printed and in that in the second printing mode in each case a receiving

sheet is first printed on the side which corresponds to the predetermined side in the first
printing mode and only then the other side.
A printing apparatus for performing the method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that said printing apparatus (2) comprises control means (55) which

automatically set the printing apparatus to the second printing mode (Fig. 3) when the
printing apparatus (2) for making a booklet is only set (57) to double-folding and

possibly stapling of a printed set of receiving sheets.
A printing apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the control
means also set the printing apparatus to the second printing mode when the printing

apparatus (2) for making a booklet of a set of original sheets (28) each containing one
page has been set to a printing order (56) adapted thereto.
