<ABSTRACT>
A writing instrument has an ink reservoir (22) 
under pressure. Compressed ink in the ink reservoir 

(22) is supplied through an ink passage (27) to a ball 
tip (24) also acting as a valve body. A push rod (32) 

is inserted in the ink passage (27) and is intended to 
urge the ball (26) forward. The ball tip (24) is in a 

closed state when the writing instrument is used and is 
in an open state when the writing instrument is used for 

supplying ink. A stirring weight (31) is housed in the 
ink reservoir (22). When the writing instrument is 

swung, the stirring weight (31) is moved to stir ink in 
the ink reservoir (22). The stirring weight (31) interferes 

with the push rod (32) to displace it. The push 
rod (32) is displaced to stir ink in the ink passage 

(27) whereby ink containing air and/or air bubbles in 
the ink passage (27) is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a writing instrument 
such as a correction liquid marker, a paint marker 
and the like, and more particularly to a writing instrument 
which can stir in the ink passage ink which is 
being supplied from the ink reservoir to the nib. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to an improvement of a writing instrument which 
compresses air in a cap to be forced into the main body 
when the cap is mounted on the main body so that ink is 
supplied to the nib under the pressure of the compressed 
air. Various kinds of correction liquid markers have 
recently developed for applying correction liquid to 
required portions. These developed correction liquid 
markers have the advantages that they can be used more 
conveniently than the conventional ones and they can be 
applied to narrow portions with clear contour. FIG. 1 shows a conventional correction liquid 
marker. A main body 1 is cylindrical and contains an 
ink reservoir 2 which is filled with correction ink or 
correction liquid. To the front end of the main body 1 
is connected a nib holder 5 whose front end portion 
holds a nib portion such as a ball tip 3. The front end 
of the ball tip 3 holds a ball 4 having a relatively 
large diameter. An ink passage 8 extends through the 
nib holder 5 and the ball tip 3 and connects the ink  
 
reservoir 8 to the interior of the ball tip 3. A spring 
6 is provided in the ink passage 8. A push rod 7 made 
of a piano wire, for example, extends to the ball 4 from 
an end of the spring 6 which is remoter from the ink 
reservoir 2. The free front end of the push rod 7 abuts 
against the ball 3 so that the ball 4 is urged forward 
to close the ball tip 3. A cap 9 is slidably fitted in an air tightness on 
the front end portion of the nib holder 5. Upon fitting 
the cap 9 on the nib holder 5, air in the cap 9 is compressed 
and is pushed in the ink reservoir 2 through the 
ink passage 3. Stirring weights 10 such as steel balls are provided 
in the ink reservoir 2 and are moved therein by 
swinging the correction liquid marker. The correction liquid marker of this type is 
usually called a cap compression type writing 
instrument. Every time the cap 9 is fitted on the nib 
holder, air is introduced under pressure in the ink 
reservoir 2, thereby permanently maintaining a predetermined 
pressure in the ink reservoir 2. Since the ball 4 
is urged forward by the spring 6 and the push rod 7 and 
by the pressure in the ink reservoir 2 as well, the ball 
tip 3 is closed by the ball 4 to
