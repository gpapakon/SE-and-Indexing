<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the incineration of 
granular or particulate material, in particular to apparatus 
for the thermal reclamation of a material such as foundry 
sand. Used foundry sand may be subjected to reclamation so that it 
can be re-used in foundry processes. Such reclamation can 
take the form of mechanical attrition, whereby the sand is 
broken down into grain-size particles. However, used foundry 
sand contains a high proportion of chemical bonding agents, eg 
phenolic resins, and after a while these agents reach such a 
level that the properties of the sand deteriorate, even with 
mechanical reclamation. Consequently, there is a need for a 
thermal reclamation technique whereby the chemical agents are 
incinerated, leaving relatively clean sand. Such thermal 
reclamation is typically conducted in a furnace having a 
fluidised bed. In a fluidised bed furnace, material to be treated is fed in 
and incinerated, the waste gases escaping through a flue stack 
at the top of the furnace. The reclaimed material is removed 
either periodically or continuously. The reaction may be 
substantially self-sustaining. That is to say, in theory at 
least, once the combustion process has reached a steady state 
from start-up (typically at around 800Â°C), there is no need to 
supply significant amounts of fuel gas since the combustion is 
supported by burning of the chemical agents. (GB-A-2 244 939) Since furnaces of this type are subjected to considerable 
variations in temperature, yet must be completely air-tight in 
the fluidised zone, considerable problems are encountered with 
cracking or even collapse due to thermal expansion. Hitherto, 
attempts have been made to overcome these problems by 
constructing the walls of the furnace of specially shaped 
refractory concrete. Alternatively, the fluidised bed has  
 
been enclosed in a stainless steel tank, which may be 
corrugated, having an external jacket of insulating material, 
such as ceramic fibre, with minimal thermal expansivity, the 
remainder of the furnace comprising a steel casing also lined 
with ceramic fibre. Furnace designs of this kind suffer from a number of 
disadvantages. They are, for example, relatively complex and 
costly to manufacture. In addition, maintenance is difficult 
and costly to carry out. There has now been devised an incineration furnace including a 
fluidised bed which overcomes or substantially mitigates the 
above-mentioned problems. According to the invention, there is provided incineration 
apparatus

<CLAIMS>
Incineration apparatus for incinerating a particulate 
material, the apparatus comprising a furnace housing (2), 

feeding means (7) for feeding the material to be incinerated 
into the housing (2) such that, in use, a bed of particulate 

material extends across substantially all of the lower part of 
the housing (2), and gas supply means (6a-c) for introducing a 

gas into a central region of the bed so as to form a fluidised 
bed region (8), the gas supply means (6a-c) being spaced from 

the walls of the furnace housing (2) such that the walls are 
insulated from the fluidised bed region (8) by particulate 

material not in a fluidised state.

gas supply means (6a-c) comprises an arrangement of pipes 

fitted with nozzles or bubble caps. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the spacing between the gas supply means (6a-c) and 

the walls of the furnace housing (2) is sufficient to ensure 
thermal insulation of the walls from the fluidised bed (8). 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the fluidised bed (8) is formed wholly of material 

being incinerated. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 1 
to 4, wherein the fluidised bed is formed of a separate medium 

such as sand. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 1 
to 4, wherein the material forming the insulating layer is 

material to be incinerated. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the furnace housing (2) is of mild steel.  

 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the furnace housing (2) has a lining (3) of material

Incineration apparatus as claimed in Claim 8, wherein the 
lining (3) comprises ceramic fibre. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in Claim 8 or Claim 9, 
wherein the lining (3) includes an impervious membrane to 

prevent combustion products condensing on the internal surface 
of the furnace housing (2). 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in Claim 10, wherein 
the membrane is a stainless steel foil. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 8 
to 11, wherein a barrier (9) is interposed between the 

lining (3) and the insulating layer of particulate material to 
prevent penetration of that material into the lining. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in Claim 12, wherein 
the barrier (9) is of vacuum-formed ceramic fibre board. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein material to be incinerated is fed directly into a 

lower part of the fluidised bed (8). 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in Claim 14, wherein 
the material to be incinerated is fed to a confined space 

beneath the fluidised bed by means of a mechanical conveyor. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in Claim 14, wherein 
the material to be incinerated is fed to the fluidised bed (8) 

by means of a pneumatic conveyor, and is injected into the 
bed (8) at substantially the same level as the gas. 
Incineration apparatus as claimed in any preceding  
 

claim, wherein material to be incinerated is fed to the
