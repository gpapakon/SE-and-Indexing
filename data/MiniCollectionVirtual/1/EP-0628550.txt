<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a series of novel pyridazine analogs
which exhibit selective inhibition of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme, to
compositions containing the novel pyridazine analogs and methods for
therapeutic utility. More particularly, the interleukin-1β-converting
enzyme inhibitors described in this invention comprise novel pyridazine
analogs which possess particular utility in the treatment of inflammatory,
immune-based diseases and cancer.Interleukin-1β protease (also known as interleukin-1β-converting
enzyme or ICE) is the enzyme responsible for processing of the
biologically inactive 31 kD precursor IL-1β to the biologically active
17 kD form (Kostura, M.J.; Tocci, M.J.; Limjuco, G.; Chin, J.; Cameron, P.;
Hillman, A.G.; Chartrain, N.A.; Schmidt, J.A. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci., 1989,
86, 5227-5231 and Black, R.A.; Kronheim, S.R.; Sleath, P.R. FEBS Let.,
1989, 247, 386-391). In addition to acting as one of the body's early
responses to injury and infection, IL-1β has also been proposed to act
as a mediator of a wide variety of diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, and acute
and chronic myelogenous leukemia (Dinarello, C.A.; Wolff, S.M.,
New Engl. J. Med., 1993, 328, 106). The naturally occurring IL-1β
receptor antagonist has been used to demonstrate the intermediacy of
IL-1β in a number of human diseases and animal models
(Hannum, C.H.; Wilcox, C.J.; Arend, W.P.; Joslin, G.G.; Dripps, D.J.;
Heimdal, P.L.; Armes, L.G.; Sommer, A.; Eisenberg, S.P.;
Thompson, R.C., Nature, 1990, 343, 336-340; Eisenberg, S.P.;
Evans, R.J.; Arend, W.P.; Verderber, E.; Brewer, M.T.; Hannum, C.H.;
Thompson, R.C., Nature 1990, 343, 341-346; Ohlsson, K.; Bjork, P.;
Bergenfeldt, M.; Hageman, R.; Thompson, R.C., Nature, 1990, 348,
550-552; and Wakabayashi, G., FASEB, 1991, 338-343). The specific
role of IL-1β in inflammation and immunomodulation is supported by the
recent observation that the cowpox virus employs an inhibitor of ICE to
suppress the inflammatory response of its host (Ray, C.A. et al, Cell,
1992, 69, 597-604). The present invention also relates to the modulation of
processing of IL-1β for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Levels of
IL-1β are known to be elevated in the synovial fluid of patients with the
disease. Additionally, IL-1β stimulates the synthesis of enzymes
believed to be involved in inflammation, such as collagenase and PLA2,
and produces joint destruction which is very similar to rheumatoid
arthritis following intra-articular
