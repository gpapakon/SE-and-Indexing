<ABSTRACT>
After primary blasting is applied to the outer 
circumferential surface of a cylindrical valve lifter the upper 

end of which is closed with an abrasive to form a rough surface 
(7), a secondary blasting is applied to the rough surface (7) 

with an abrasive which has particle size smaller than that of 
the first abrasive. Smaller irregularities (8) are formed 
on 
the rough surface (7), and a coated layer (6) is formed by 

thermal spraying on the surface (8), thereby increasing 
adhesive strength of the coated layer (6) by anchoring effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of treating the 
surface of a valve lifter, and particularly, to a method 
of coating the outer circumferential surface of the valve 
lifter moulded from aluminium or its alloy, with wear 
resistant material. In a valve lifter or tappet for use in a direct acting 
valve gear of an internal combustion engine, its body was 
conventionally moulded from iron such as steel or cast 
iron. Recently, in order to make the valve gear 
lightened, an Al alloy valve lifter has been used. However, such an Al alloy valve lifter has lower 
mechanical strength and wear resistance than an iron 
lifter, so that an Al alloy cylinder which has the valve 
lifter allows sliding faces to wear earlier or brings 
about scoring. To prevent such disadvantages, the outer 
circumferential surface of the Al valve lifter is coated 
with wear resistance material different from the base 
material. In this respect, it is necessary to increase 
adhesiveness of wear resistance material, thereby 
increasing adhesion strength to the base material. There 
is a method of treating the surface to form a rough 
surface and coating the surface with wear resistant 
material. To form the rough surface, before surface 
treatment such as thermal spraying is made, blasting is 
conventionally made with grit which has relatively large 
particle size. JP-A-60044267 discloses a method of improving the attachment 
of a metallisation layer to the slide surface of a piston 
by using a blasting material which can remove oxide 
layers over the surface of mother material as well as 
enhancing the attachment of metallisation. The method  
 
has a single blasting stage using an abrasive. The 
abrasive comprises particles of different sizes. JP-A-2040009 discloses a valve lifter having an iron-carbon 
series thermal spraying layer deposited on the outer 
surface of the valve lifter to improve wear and abrasion 
characteristics. Recently, allowable rotation speed and maximum brake 
power of an engine have been inclined to increase, and 
stress which acts on the circumferential surface of a 
valve lifter, such as bending or shearing stress, becomes 
excessive. A valve lifter in which the above Al alloy 
base material is coated with wear resistant material on 
the outer circumferential surface requires high adhesion 
strength at the coated layer. However, in the above surface treating method by spraying 
after a single blasting, the coated layer has  
 
insufficient adhesion strength. It is an object of the present invention

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating a surface of a valve lifter an 
upper end of which is closed, the method comprising 

the steps of: 

(a) applying primary blasting to at least an outer 
circumferential surface of a valve lifter body which 

is moulded from alumimium or an aluminium alloy with 
a first abrasive which comprises grit to form a 

roughened surface having coarse irregularities 
constituting a surface roughness Rz of 60 µm to 130 

µm; 
(b) applying secondary blasting to the roughened 
surface with a second abrasive of alumina which has 

particle sizes smaller than that of the first 
abrasive in the primary blasting to form smaller 

surface irregularities constituting a surface 
roughness Rz of not more than 10 µm on the coarse 

irregularities formed by the primary blasting while 
maintaining a presence of coarse irregularities; and 
(c) forming a coated layer of hard-wearing material 
on the roughened surface. 
A method as defined in claim 1, wherein the grit 
has particle size of #12 to #40 and the alumina has 

particle size of #100 to #240. 
A method as defined in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the coated layer is formed by 

thermal spraying.
