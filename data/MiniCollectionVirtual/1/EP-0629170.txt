<ABSTRACT>
Loading device having elongated goods moving devices (1), each comprising a goods-carrying beam (5), which is displaceable up and down relative to an underlaying frame (3). The frame is countersunk in a storing surface (2) for the goods, so that the goods-carrying beam in its lowered position is under the storing surface and over the same in its raised position. A trolley (6) supports the goods-carrying beam (5) for a lengthwise movement on the frame and partly also outside the same. The goods-carrying beam and the trolley can be displaced lengthwise relative to each other whereby the goods-carrying beam (5) will be displaced vertically. The displacement of the goods-carrying beam relative to the trolley is effected by means of elements (40, 42) activated by a power means (38) to be pressed against supporting surfaces (46, 47) on the goods-carrying beam respective the trolley. In raised position of the goods-carrying beams the goods resting on the same can be moved by movement of the trolleys. In the lowered position the goods are carried by the storing surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a conveyor device for carrying of 
goods according to the preample av claim 1. More closely the 
invention relates to a device arranged in a foundation, by 
means of which device goods placed on the same can be moved from 
a storing surface to another and essentially in horizontal 
direction by means of reciprocating beams. From e.g. the European patent specification 0 103 999 
(Dickson-Wright, Edward Anthony) is known a device for 
moving of goods. The same consists of a number of longitudinal 
and substantially parallel and in a foundation 
arranged moving organs. These are including an upper, goods 
carrying parts in form of goods carrying beams and supporting 
lower profiles which are counter-sinked in the foundation. 
In the profile is enclosed a rail for rollers, which 
allows the goods carrying part to be displaced relative to 
the profile. For raising and lowering of the rail and 
thereby also of the goods carrying part is provided a 
longitudinal, hose-shaped part, which can be expanded 
thereby raising the goods carrying part by supply a 
pressure medium as pressure air. A similar device is known from the Swedish publication 318 
822 (Iversen) and WO 86/04883 (Hagedorn). Raising and 
lowering of the goods carrying part is here effected by 
lengthwise displacement of this part relative to an 
underlaying trolley. The displacement is effected by means 
of pulling forces in a chain or similar flexible element 
which also is used for the movement of the trolley and  
 
which ends are secured to the trolley respective the goods 
carrying part. The intention is that the foundation, in which the parts 
are counter-sinked, shall form a surface for placing of 
goods, which are delivered by means of other conveyors, 
fork-trucks or cranes for example. The goods carrying parts 
can be moved from a position within the reach of the rails 
to a position outside of the same. By raising of the goods 
carrying parts the on the foundation resting goods can be 
raised a little. By movement of the goods carrying parts 
the goods resting thereon will be moved in the 
same direction and can consequently be moved to a position 
outside of the foundation. If also here is arranged a 
resting surface with recesses, which allow containing of 
the goods carrying parts, the goods by lowering of these 
parts can be placed on this resting surface whereof the 
goods carrying parts can be withdrawn in lowered position 
in the profiles for repetition of the operation. By moving 
of the goods carrying

Conveyor device having parallel, reciprocating goods 
carrying beams (5) for carrying of goods as containers or 

pallets to and fro a storing surface (2) by lengthwise 
movement of the goods carrying beams in a raised position 

above the storing surface, while in a lowered position 
below the storing surface the goods carrying beams are free 

to effect its lengthwise movement, the conveyor device 
including a number of substantially parallel to each other 

positioned, elongated goods moving devices (1), which are 
counter sinked in the storing surface (2) and each comprising 

one of said goods carrying beams (5) having an upwards 
turned surface for the carrying of the goods, supporting 

means (6) for the carrying beams (5), a frame (3) resting on a foundation, 
roller means (25) between the frame and the supporting 

means, driving means (11, 50, 51, 55) 
provided for the lengthwise movement of the supporting means 

together with the carrying beams relative to the frame, 
raising means provided to effect a vertical 

displacement of the carrying beams relative to the supporting 
means between said raised and said lowered position, 

the raising means comprising a power device (38, 40-42, 46, 
47) provided to effect lengthwise relative displacement of 

the goods carrying beam (5) relative to the respective supporting 
means (6) between a first and second mutual position with 

surfaces (21) of the beam resting on surfaces (26) of the 
supporting means, said surfaces being shaped to lift the 

beam relative to the supporting means by said lengthwise 
movement in the direction from said first to said second mutual 

position and lower the same by movement in the opposite 
direction, 
characterized in
 that said power 
device of said raising means 

comprises a power means (38) and a holding means 
(41, 42), said two means being connected to the frame (3)  

 
and each one being provided with a contact surface, 

the one surface provided to be brought into 
contact with surfaces (47) on the carrying beams (5) and 

the other, oppositely facing surface, to be brought into contact with a surface (46) on

being displaceable relative the surface of the holding 
means (41, 42) by activation of the power means, said power 

device further comprising an activating device (43, 44) 
provided to move the power and holding means between a 

first position in which the surfaces of the holding means 
and the power means are in a position to be brought in 

contact with a respective of the surfaces on the carrying 
beams and the supporting means and a second position in 

which the first said surfaces are removed from the other 
said surfaces, so that, in said first position, said relative lengthwise 

displacement between the goods carrying beam and the
