<ABSTRACT>
One of the two rotors (7, 12), rotating coaxially and independently at different speeds, is provided with a through-hole (22) and with a roller or small cylinder (20) mounted so as to rotate idly about an axis which is parallel and offset with respect to the common axis of the two rotors (7, 12); a rigid internal circular track (14) is mounted on the other rotor (12) with, in between, a ring (16) having high elastic flexibility. Solidly fastened to the first rotor (7) is a profiled appendage (107) for partially surrounding the roller or small cylinder (20) and for forming a yarn-guide casing (FIG. 1).
