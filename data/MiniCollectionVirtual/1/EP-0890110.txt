<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a process for testing the ground contact of parts of a networked system where data are sent and received over at least one line and at least one line is connected to every part via a resistor and a contact with the common potential of the part and can be connected to a further potential by means of a controllable switch where, by means of the resistor, the potential is compared to a pre-set potential, if the line shows a potential in a transient state and where the state of the ground contact of the part is determined by comparing the potential by means of the resistor with the pre-set potential. The invention also concerns a device for carrying out the process.

A method of testing the earthing contact of subscribers (SG1, SG2 ..., SGn) of a

subscriber (SG1, SG2, ..., SGn) via a resistance arrangement (RTH) and a contact 

with a common potential (GND) of the subscribers (SG1, SG2, ..., SGn) and can 
be connected via a controllable switch (transceiver) to a further potential (VCC), 

whereby the voltage (URTH) is via the resistance arrangement (RTH) compared 
with a given potential if the line (CAN_H) has a potential in a steady-state 

condition whereby, from a comparison of the voltage (URTH) via the resistance 
arrangement (RTH) with the given potential it is possible to arrive at a conclusion 

concerning the state of the earth contact of the subscriber (SG1, SG2, ..., SGn). 
A method of testing the earthing contact of subscribers (SG1, SG2, ..., SGn) of 
a cross-linked system whereby via at least one line (CAN_H, CAN_L) data are 

sent and received, whereby at least one line (CAN_L) is connected to each 
subscriber (SG1, SG2, ..., SGn) via a resistance arrangement (RTL) with a 

subscriber-specific potential (VCC) of subscribers (SG1, SG2, ..., SGn) and can 
be connected to a common potential GND) via a controllable switch (transceiver) 

and a contact, whereby the voltage (URTL) is via the resistance arrangement 
(RTL) compared with a given potential if the line (CAN_L) has a potential in a 

steady-state condition whereby, from a comparison of the voltage (URTL) via the 
resistance arrangement (RTL) with the given potential it is possible to draw a 

conclusion concerning the condition of the earth contact of the subscriber (SG1, 
SG2, ..., SGn).

characterised in that
 the potential in the steady-state 
condition corresponds to the subscriber specific potential (VCC).  

 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the comparison 
takes place after a certain time lapse once the line (CAN_H, CAN_L) has been 

switched to a specific potential by means of the controllable switch (CAN-transceiver). 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
