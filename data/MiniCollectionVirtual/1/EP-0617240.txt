<ABSTRACT>
Mixed boiler for the provision of domestic hot water and heating water, having a primary heat exchanger (3), ... domestic hot water heat exchanger (11) which can be connected during drawing operation, and a flow temperature regulator (21) which is assigned a comparator (22) connected to a flow temperature setpoint generator (19) with a flow temperature sensor (18). In order to be able optimally to regulate the outlet temperature of domestic hot water, too, provision is made, when the domestic hot water heat exchanger (11) is activated, for the input, connected to the flow temperature setpoint generator (19), of the comparator (22) assigned to the flow temperature regulator (21) to be supplied with the output signal of a domestic hot water temperature regulator (23) which is connected, on the input side, to a comparator (24) whose inputs are connected to a domestic hot water outlet temperature sensor (26) and a domestic hot water setpoint generator (20).

Combined water heater for service and heating water, comprising a 
primary heat exchanger supplied from a heat source, such heat 

exchanger being alternatively connectable with a heating system or a 
service water heat exchanger via a priority control valve controlled by a 

tapping valve, and further comprising an upstream temperature regulator 
associated with a comparator device connected with an upstream 

temperature setpoint generator and an upstream temperature sensor, 
operating in such a way that, if the service water heat exchanger (11) is 

activated, the input connected with the upstream temperature setpoint 
generator (19) of the comparator device (22) associated with the 

upstream temperature regulator (21) receives the output signal of a 
service water temperature regulator (23), whose input side is connected 

with a comparator device (24) whose inputs, in turn, are connected with a 
service water discharge temperature sensor (26) and a service water 

setpoint generator (20), 
characterized in that
 the output of the service 
water temperature regulator (23) is connected with a comparator device 

(25) whose second input is connected with the service water setpoint 
generator (20), with this comparator device (25) operating to control a 

switching function depending on the difference between the output signal 
of the service water temperature regulator (23) and the service water 

setpoint temperature, such switching function acting in such a way that  
 

the regulating characteristic of the service water temperature regulator 
(23) is switched over from a proportional regulating characteristic to a 

proportional integral regulating characteristic when the regulating 
deviation falls short of a certain preset difference, and vice versa.
