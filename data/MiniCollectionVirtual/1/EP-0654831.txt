<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a solar cell comprising the step
of forming a layer of n-type compound semiconductor, a layer of

p-type compound semiconductor, and a layer of electrode on a
glass substrate, wherein one of said step of forming the layer of

compound semiconductor layer comprises preparing a paste by
mixing a raw semiconductor material and a viscous agent, applying

said paste, drying said paste to harden, and burning said paste,
and giving vibration to said substrate while or after the

application of the paste, to remove the bubbles in the pastes
resulting in a semiconductor layers, smooth, dense and having

good adherence to each other, thus realizing a solar cell with
improved and uniform characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a solar 
cell of compound semiconductors by way of coating and burning. In recent years, expectation for solar cells as a clean 
energy source has been raised, in view of the global warming, acid 
rain. ozone layer destruction or such environment destruction. For 
the wide usage of the cells improvement of the photo-electric 
conversion efficiency and reduction of the cost are the most 
important. For that purpose, solar cells of compound 
semiconductors of III-V group as GaAs, InP, II-VI group as 
CdS/Cu₂S. CdS/CdTe, or I-III-VI₂ group as CuInS₂, CuInSe₂, as well 
as crystalline and amorphous silicon solar cells, have been 
investigated in many countries of the world. Among these, solar 
cells of compound semiconductors of n-CdS/p-CdTe have been 
practiced commercially, with relatively low material cost, 
conversion efficiency as high as 10%, less deterioration in long 
run, and relatively simple manufacturing process suitable for 
mass production consisting of repeated printing, drying, burning 
(sintering or baking) resulting in possible high density 
arrangement on a glass plate and realization of high voltage  
 
without outer wire connection as well as large area cells. A typical solar cell of II-V group semiconductor, of which 
a sectional view is shown in Fig. 1, comprises a glass substrate 1 
of high light transmittance and electrical insulation is provided 
on one surface thereof with a n-type CdS layer 2, a p-type CdTe 
layer 3, a current collecting carbon electrode layer 4, an Ag·In 
electrode which is the positive terminal 5, and an Ag·In electrode 
which is the negative terminal 6 formed by stacking with printing 
and baking for each step. Usually, further, although not shown 
in the figure, thus prepared solar cell element is provided. on 
both the Ag·In electrodes, with a copper paste deposited, dried 
and baked for easy soldering of lead wires. The remaining part 
is then covered all over with a passivation layer of a 
thermosetting resin such as epoxy deposited and baked. Light, including that of the sun, falls on the surface of 
the glass substrate 1 opposite to the surface having the above 
solar cell element layers, to generate electric power by photoelectric 
conversion. As the substrate a heat-resistant barium borosilicate glass 
is employed, which has very low alkaline metal content and high 
softening point. In the manufacturing of the compound semiconductor solar 
cell by coating and burning method, it is important that each
