<ABSTRACT>
A container for waste is provided with a cylinder-shell-shaped cover (4) which is provided, at its ends, with radially inwardly oriented arms (2) or strips which are articulated on opposite sides of the essentially rectangular container such that they can be pivoted in the region of the axis of curvature (3) of the cover. The container is provided with at least one additional smaller opening (8), which serves for filling. In order to prevent bulky items from also being thrown in through the large cylinder-shell-shaped cover during filling, the cover is provided with a locking mechanism (10,11,12) which is released automatically when the container is tilted about a pivot axis parallel to the pivot axis of the cover.

<CLAIMS>
A collecting container (20) for refuse, preferably for 
recyclable refuse, with a lid (4) in the shape of a cylindrical 

shell, which is provided at its end sides with radially inwardly 
pointing arms or blades (2), which are in the zone of the axis of 

curvature of the lid (4) pivotably articulated at opposite sides 
of the substantially rectangular container trough, and with at 

least one additional smaller opening (8, 8'), wherein the lid is 
provided with a bolting device to be released for the emptying,
 
characterized in that
 
the bolting device is automatically released during the tipping 

of the container round an axis of pivoting parallel to the pivot 
pin (3) of the lid (4). 
A collecting container according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the container trough (1) is, adjoining an edge parallel 

to the pivot pin (3), provided with an opening whose length corresponds 
to the width or length of the trough and which is delimited 

by an edge, parallel to said edge, of a plate (7) closing 
the remaining part of the trough opening, which plate is disposed 

in the zone of the longitudinal median plane of the trough (1), 
and that the additional smaller opening (8, 8') is arranged in 

this plate (7). 
A collecting container according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the plate (7), rising obliquely in a roof-shape from the 

edge of the container trough (1) that lies on the opposite side 
to the edge of the opening, is joined to the edge of the trough. 
A collecting container according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the wedge-shaped lateral zone between the plate (7) and  

 
the edge of the trough is closed by triangular walls (9). 
A collecting container according to claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that, starting approximately from the longitudinal 

median plane of the trough (1), the triangular wall (9) is continued 
over the width of the opening
 by a plate (22) whose upper 
edge is curved according to the curvature of the lid (4) with the 

shape of a cylindrical shell. 
A collecting container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the additional opening (8, 8') is 

surrounded by a high flange. 
A collecting container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the additional opening can be 

closed by a hinged lid (13, 13'). 
A collecting container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that at the opening edge of the trough 

(1), there are provided receiving means (5) for gripper claws of 
a lifting-tipping device. 
A collecting container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the bolting means consists of a 

gravity pendulum on at least one container wall, pivotable round 
a pin (12) parallel to the pivot pin (3), which pendulum is provided 

with a hook-shaped extension (23) that engages in the 
closed position behind a locking bolt (10) situated on a pivoting 

arm (2). 
A collecting container according to claim 9, characterized 
in that in the closed position, the locking bolt (10) is disposed 

together with the pivot pin (12) of the pendulum (11) approximately 
in the same horizontal plane of the container trough (1). 
A collecting container according to one of claims 9 or 10, 
characterized in that the locking bolt (10) is provided with a  

 
predetermined breaking point. 
A collecting container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that on at least one trough side, one 

end of a freely projecting leaf spring (14) is secured in the 
zone of the pivot pin (3), which spring reaches between two 

bearing means or pins (17, 17') arranged on the pivoting arm, and 
that in the closed position of the lid (4), the leaf spring (14) 

is stressed in the direction towards its open position and 
stressed in the opposite direction in its open position. 
A collecting container according to claim 12, characterized 
in that the bottom end of the leaf spring (14) is partly rolled 

round a tubular part (16) fixed to the container, which part is 
provided along a generator with a slot in which there engages a 

bent end portion (15) of the leaf spring.
