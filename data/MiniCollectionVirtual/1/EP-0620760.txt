<DESCRIPTION>
In the recent past, there have been several well 
documented instances of the inadvertent spillage of liquids 
causing both environmental, ecological, and even 
toxicological problems. Examples of spilled liquids 
include both oil spills, and the spillage of the materials 
known loosely as PCB's. For nearly all spilled liquids, 
methods of clean-up and disposal are known, even for 
relatively difficult ones, such as crude oil and PCB's. 
However, in order to be able to dispose of a spilled 
liquid, two factors, not one, are important. First, it is 
necessary to be able to recover the spilled liquid. 
Second, it is desirable to be able to carry out the 
recovery step in such a way that the recovered spilled 
liquid can be easily and relatively simply separated from 
any agent used in the recovery step. For example, an oil 
spill can be cleaned up with a water/detergent mixture, but 
that only transforms the problem into one of disposing of 
the oil/water/detergent mixture. At present, although many clean-up methods have 
been proposed for dealing with spilled liquids, such as 
crude oil spills, there is no commercially available 
product which will recover a spilled liquid in an easily 
handleable form, and also do so in a manner permitting the 
simple separation of the recovered liquid from the recovery 
agent. This invention seeks to overcome these 
difficulties by providing a particulate reusable absorbent 
capable of absorbing many spilled liquids, and from which 
the absorbed liquid can be removed by the simple process of 
centrifugation. The main limitation on the use of the 
particulate absorbent of this invention is the properties 
of the liquid spilled. Any liquid, such as a highly 
corrosive acid, which would destroy a polyurethane polymer, 
cannot be recovered using the product of this invention.  
 In a first broad aspect, this invention provides 
a process for preparing a polyurethane particulate liquid 
absorbent which comprises: 
(i) reacting together at a temperature of from 180°C 
to 200°C, for a time of less than 10 minutes, a prepolymer 
of the formula A 
 
with a prepolymer of the general formula B 
 
in the presence of a lower alkylester solvent of the 
general formula C 
R₁ COOR₄ 
in which: 
nrepresents 1, 2, or 3; R₁represents a lower alkyl group having 1 to 
6 carbon atoms; R₂represents hydrogen, or a lower alkyl 
group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; R₃represents a lower alkyl group 
having 1 to 3 carbon atoms,  
and R₄ represents a lower alkyl group 
and when R₂ is other than
