<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tablet for processing 
a silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material, 
and more particularly relates to a tablet for preparing a 
processing solution of a silver halide color photographic 
light-sensitive material having sufficient strength and 
excellent storage stability. A silver halide photographic light-sensitive material 
after being exposed is photographically processed through a 
development step, a desalting step, a washing step and a 
stabilization step. The photographic processing is ordinarily 
conducted using an automatic processing machine. On such an 
occasion, a replenisher replenishing system is commonly used 
wherein the processing solution in a processing tank is 
controlled so that the degree of activity thereof is kept  
 
constant. In the case of the replenisher replenishing system, 
the purposes thereof include dilution of materials dissolved 
from the light-sensitive material, and replenishment of 
consumed components, usually resulting in an occurrence of a 
large amount of an over flowing waste solution and an empty 
vessel. There has been a world wide movement for making 
regulations prohibiting disposal of photo-effluent directly 
into ocean and regulations plastic materials. In addition, 
safety regulations on packaging materials have been 
strengthened for maintaining safety in transportation of 
liquid hazardous substances, resulting in creased cost. 
Accordingly, a new development of a processing system wherein 
a photographic disposal is reduced remarkably and bottles for 
processing agents are not used is demanded. In mini lab shops using compact processing machines which 
have recently been spreading rapidly, development of 
technologies for controlling exposure for a print has been 
advanced and a system wherein anybody can conduct printing 
operation is being introduced. However, dissolving operation 
of the replenishing solution and control of the processing 
solution are still difficult so that a critical error to 
dissolve a wrong processing agent and to erroneously replenish 
the processing solution may easily occur. Thus, this 
conventional replenishment system has resulted complaints 
frequently.  
 Accordingly, in the photographic industry, it has 
strongly been demanded to develop a replenishment system using 
solid chemicals wherein substantially no photographic waste 
solution occurs, no bottles for processing agents are used and 
no dissolution operation is necessary. As a method to meet 
this demand,
