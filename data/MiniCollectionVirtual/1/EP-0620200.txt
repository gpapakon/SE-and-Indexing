<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method for press molding 
preforms (1a) to obtain optical articles in which each preform (1a) 

is prepared beforehand to have a diameter (Dp) larger than that 
of an optically functional area of the optical article and 

edges of the preform (1a) to be press mold contact with molding 
surfaces of a pair of molds (2a,b) outside an area of each molding 

surface corresponding to the optically functional area of 
the optical article, thereby elongating the lifetime of 

molds (2a,b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing optical articles of high
precision and high quality by press molding, which considerably lengthens the
lifetime of molds being used. The invention particularly relates to a method of
manufacturing optical articles of convex shape comprising the steps of placing a
preform between two concave molding surfaces of a pair of molds, and pressing
said preform with said molds so that the shapes of said molding surfaces are
transferred to said preform.An example of a preform for use in a molding process is described in JP-A-60 246
231 in the form of a glass cylinder cut to a given length, both end surfaces being
polished to mirror finished surfaces as shown in Fig. 11. Further, JP-A-61 261 225
describes another example of a preform in which a block of glass shaped to a
sphere as shown in Fig. 12. Finally, JP-A-04 330 403 shows the press forming of
a convex lens in which an annular groove or rim is formed outside the effective
diameter of the lens, and which is used for fixing the lens precisely. The lifetime of molds is a very
important factor in the press molding of optical articles.
Namely, the cost for manufacturing molds becomes very high
since they need a very high precision finishing to mold
optical articles of a high precision. The price of each
optical article press molded includes a fraction of the
manufacturing cost of molds naturally. Thus, the cost per
optical article to be charged becomes lower as the lifetime
of molds becomes longer.Conventionally, special cares have been paid for
the hardness of a preform material and protection layer
formed on a molding surface to enhance the lifetime of
molds. Since the molding surface contacts with a preform
heated up to a high temperature, it must be covered by a
protection layer which is hard-oxidized and inactive to
the preform material such as glass.Material for molds must have a hardness enough
for maintaining a high working precision against forces
exerted from the preform. As to the material for molds,
cemented carbides or metals including tangusten are used
satisfactorily and platinum film is used for the protection
layer. The high precision press molding of optical
articles becomes available by development of material for
molds and protection layer mentioned above. The mold having a protection layer is gradually
deteriorated in its shape precision by use for a long time
and the surface of the protection layer is roughened by
continual contact with glass of a high temperature.

A method of manufacturing optical articles of convex shape comprising the
steps of placing a preform (1a; 1c; 1a) between two concave molding surfaces (4;

5d, 5b) of a pair of molds (2a, 2b; 2a, 2b, 2d, 2b); and

pressing said preform (1a; 1c; 1a) with said molds (2a, 2b; 2a, 2b; 2d, 2b) so that
the shapes of said molding surfaces are transferred to said preform (1a; 1c),

characterized in

that the molding surfaces (4; 5d, 5b) of the upper and lower molds (2a, 2b; 2a,
2b; 2d, 2b) each consist of an inner area (5) which press molds an optically

functional portion of the optical articles and an outer area (6) which press molds an
optically non-functional portion of the optical articles, and
that the points of each preform (1a; 1c) which contact these molding surfaces (4;
5d, 5b) at the initial stage of press molding are located in the outer areas (6) and

at least at such a distance from the inner area (5) that flaws created on the molding
surfaces (4; 5d, 5b) upon the manufacture of a certain number of optical

articles are located outside the inner area (5).
The method of manufacturing optical articles
according to claim 1, wherein

said preform (1a; 1c) has a columnar shape having a larger diameter (Dp)
than the diameter of an optically functional portion (Deff) of said

optical article, said preform (1a; 1c) being placed between said
molding surfaces (4; 5d, 5b) with the end surfaces of said preform (1a; 1c)

facing said molding surfaces. 
The method of manufacturing optical articles
according to claim 2, wherein said columnar shape is a

circular cylinder (1a).
The method of manufacturing optical articles
according to claim 1, wherein said optical article has

first and second optically functional portions (Deff (L) and Deff (S))
different from

each other on both sides thereof and said preform (1a) has a
dimension larger than the larger portion between said first

and second portions.
The method of manufacturing optical articles
according to claim 1, further comprising a step of heating

said preform (1a; 1c) to soften the same before the step of pressing
said preform.
