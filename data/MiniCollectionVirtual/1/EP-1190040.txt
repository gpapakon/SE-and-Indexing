<ABSTRACT>
An anti-cancer pharmaceutical composition includes a herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector into which a nucleic acid sequence encoding for an anti-cancer agent selected from interleukin-12, GM-CSF, and CD has been inserted. A method of treatment of a patient suffering from cancer includes administering to the patient the anti-tumor pharmaceutical composition including an HSV vector having a nucleic acid sequence encoding for an anti-cancer agent selected from interleukin-12, GM-CSF, and CD inserted therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The research carried out in connection with this invention was supported under a contract (NO1-AI-62554) with the Antiviral Research Branch of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Program Project Grants (PO1 AI 24009; PO1 CA 71933), and the National Institute for Neurologic Disorders and Stroke Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (1K08NSO1942).The present invention generally relates to modified herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors and their use for the treatment of tumors. In particular, the present invention relates to HSV expressing interleukin 12 and the use thereof in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer.Eradication of malignancies arising in the brain has proven to be a formidable task. As an example, gliomas, the most common primary brain tumor, are almost always fatal despite aggressive surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy; the overall five year survival rate for glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant glioma, is less than 5.5% and the median survival is approximately one year.Because of poor survival of patients with GBM and other brain malignancies, novel therapeutic approaches, most notably viral and gene therapy, have been investigated (for reviews, see Markert et al. (1999) Rev. Med. Virology in press; Cobbs et al. (1999) Persp. Neurolog. Surg. in press; Andreansky et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 11313-11318). The efficacy of using neuroattenuated replication-competent herpes simplex viruses (HSV) for treatment of primary brain tumors is known. These viruses typically contain one or more mutations within the viral genome, including thymidine kinase (tk) (Martuza et al. (1991) Science 252, 854-856), ribonucleotide reductase (Mineta et al. (1995) Num. Gene Ther. 1, 938-943; Kramm et al. (1997) Hum. Gene Ther. 8, 2057-2068), UTPase (Pyles et al. (1997) Hum. Gene Ther. 8, 533-544) or γ134.5 (Markert et al. (1993) Neurosurg. 32, 597-603; Chambers et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 1411-1415). Moderate increases in long-term survival for engineered HSV-treated versus untreated animals have been reported in both syngeneic and xenogeneic murine tumor models of GBM (Markert et al. (2000) Rev. Med. Virology 10, 17-30; Martuza et al. (1991) Science 252, 854-856; Markert et al. (1993) Neurosurg. 32, 597-603; Chambers et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 1411-1415; Mineta et al. (1994) Gene Ther. 1 Suppl 1:S78, S78; Andreansky et al. (1997) Cancer Res. 57, 1502-1509; Andreansky et al. (1998) Gene Ther.
