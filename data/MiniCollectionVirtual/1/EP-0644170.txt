<ABSTRACT>
In order to manufacture a normally solid perfluoroalkyl bromide by thermal bromination in the gas phase of a C10 or more perfluoroalkyl iodide, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a normally liquid perfluoroalkyl bromide. This makes it possible to carry out the post-treatment operations (reduction of the iodine, separation by settling, neutralisation/washing, and the like) at room temperature.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the manufacture of a normally solid
perfluoroalkyl bromide by thermal-bromination in the gas

phase of a perfluoroalkyl iodide containing 10 or more
than 10 carbon atoms, characterized in that the bromination

is carried out in the presence of a normally liquid
perfluoroalkyl bromide in a quantity sufficient for the

mixture of the two bromides to be liquid at room temperature.
Process according to Claim 1, in which the
normally liquid perfluoroalkyl bromide is perfluorohexyl

bromide or perfluorooctyl bromide.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the
Br
2
/perfluoroalkyl iodide molar ratio is between 0.4 and
2, preferably between 0.5 and 0.8.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in
which the reactor is supplied with a homogeneous mixture

composed of bromine, the perfluoroalkyl iodide and the
normally liquid perfluoroalkyl bromide.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4 for the
manufacture of perfluorodecyl bromide from perfluorodecyl

iodide C
