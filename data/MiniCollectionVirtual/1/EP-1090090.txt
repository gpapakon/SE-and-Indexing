<ABSTRACT>
A mesophase pitch material having a melting point in excess of 350  DEG C has a solvent added thereto to provide a solvated mesophase pitch. A low molecular weight solvent is used so that the melting point can be brought low enough to create a carbon foam at a convenient temperature. The solvent is then removed by heat and/or vacuum and, consequently, the pitch reverts to a high melting point of approximately greater than 350  DEG C. The pitch can then be heated or carbonized without an oxidative stabilization step. Alternatively, a solvated mesophase pitch material may be used initially for foaming.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent application claims priority upon U.S. provisional patent
application 60/086,371, filed May 22, 1998.This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
08/970,558, filed November 14, 1997, published as WO 98/27023The present invention relates generally to the utilization of a solvated
mesophase pitch to make a carbon foam, and in particular to the use of a
solvated mesophase pitch to make a carbon foam which requires little or no
oxidative stabilization prior to carbonization of the carbon foam.Carbon-carbon composites are widely used for aircraft brake friction
materials. Although carbon-carbon is attractive because it is lightweight and
can operate at very high temperatures, the use of carbon-carbon raw material
entails the use of an expensive material. Expensive carbon fiber is a
significant component; sometimes up.to 45 percent fiber is used in making
the composite. Additionally, the manufacture of carbon-carbon is a time-consuming
process. Long cycle times are undesirable in a modern
manufacturing environment. Copending WO 98/27023
describes inventions for making an aircraft brake friction material
by means of a carbon-carbon composite material made from densified carbon
foam.
The manufacturing process
disclosed therein may be generally described by the steps of utilizing a
precursor material (thermoset or thermoplastic), foaming the precursor
material, oxygen stabilization for foams produced from thermoplastics,
carbonization, optional heat treatment, densification, and a subsequent heat
treatment. As disclosed in WO 98/27023, when a foam is made from a
thermoplastic such as a mesophase pitch, it may be necessary to cross link
the foam by oxidation before it can be heated to carbonization temperatures.
Without this oxidation (stabilization) step, the pitch may melt when it is
heated. The oxidative stabilization step can be a time-consuming process (up
to 100 hours). The objective of the invention disclosed herein is to reduce
the time required for processing the carbon foam by eliminating or replacing,
or shortening, the oxidative stabilization step. 
Relevant prior art includes JP-A-2142891. This document
discloses a pitch useful as a material for a carbon
microballoon and having uniform properties, and
infusibility, made by subjecting a refined pitch freed from
quinoline-insolubles to a specified thermal treatment in a
vacuum while blowing an inert gas into the pitch. The
obtained pitch has a softening point of 150-250째C. The invention disclosed herein utilizes
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for making a pitch-based carbon foam, comprising the
steps of providing a solvated pitch material having a softening point of

below 300째C, heating the solvated pitch material to effect melting
thereof, foaming the material to provide an open-cellular carbon foam,

removing a solvent fraction from the carbon foam and raising the
softening point to greater than 350째C such that the carbon foam

solidifies, and heating the foam within the range of 600-2000째C to
remove volatiles therefrom and provide the pitch-based carbon foam.
The method in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the pitch
material comprises one of a mesophase pitch, modified isotropic pitches,

coal tars, petroleum derived pitches, and synthetic pitches.
The method in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the pitch material is solvated by
one of tetrahydrofuran, tolulene, pyridine, benzene, and xylene.
The method in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the foaming
step comprises lowering the pressure to cause the material to form

bubbles, and then further lowering the pressure to open the bubbles to
form open cells.
The method in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the foaming
step is accomplished by one of (a) continued heating and (b) continued

heating and lowering the pressure.
