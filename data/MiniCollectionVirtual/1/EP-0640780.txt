<ABSTRACT>
A shift control system is provided for an automatic 
transmission in which a secondary shifting unit 

capable of being shifted to a high speed stage or a low 
speed stage and a primary shifting unit capable of setting 

one of plural speed stages including a reverse 
speed stage are connected in series and the secondary 

shifting unit can be set to the high speed stage upon 
setting the reverse speed stage. The shift control 

system is equipped with a reverse range detector for 
detecting a shift from a neutral range to a reverse 

range, a vehicle stop detector for detecting a vehicle 
in a stopped state, and a high speed stage command 

device for setting the secondary shifting unit at the 
high speed stage when subsequent to setting of the primary 

shifting unit at the reverse speed stage as a 
result of a shift to the reverse range, the vehicle is 

determined by a signal from the vehicle stop detector 
to have substantially stopped.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for controlling
shifting of an automatic transmission, and especially
to a shift control system for an automatic
transmission, said shift control system being constructed
so that at a predetermined speed stage, rotation
of an output shaft in a direction opposite to a
direction in which an associated vehicle should run at
the predetermined speed stage is inhibited.The function that when a predetermined speed
stage is set, rotation of an output shaft in a direction
opposite to a direction in which an associated
vehicle should run at the predetermined speed stage is
known, for example, as the hill-holding function. In a
snow mode in which a vehicle starts at a second speed,
for example, the running torque is low. If one attempts
to start the vehicle from the state that the
vehicle is at a stop on an uphill, there is the potential
problem that the vehicle may move down due to insufficiency
in torque. It is therefore the above function
that the state of engagement of a friction engagement 
device is set to prevent reverse rotation of the
output shaft at the second speed. A system for conducting
control of this type is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. SHO 62-11051.In the case of an automatic transmission
equipped, on an input side of a shifting unit for setting
plural speed ranges including a reverse range,
with a secondary shifting unit (for example, an overdrive
unit) in which a low speed stage is set by engaging
a one-way clutch and a high speed stage is set by
engaging a brake [for example, the automatic transmission
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
(Kokai) No. HEI 4-31226], the secondary shifting unit
may be set at the high speed stage upon setting the
rear range so that the change gear ratio for the rear
range is rendered appropriate. In an automatic transmission
of this type, setting of the secondary shifting
unit in the high speed range in the state that the one-way
clutch of the secondary shifting unit is engaged,
in other words, setting of the rear range in the state
that the vehicle is, for example, coasting forward
causes the one-way clutch to engage so that the
secondary shifting unit integrally rotating as a whole
is fixed by the brake. The rotation of the output
shaft in an advancing direction is therefore stopped. Shifting to the second speed in the snow mode
having the above-described hill-holding function or to
the reverse range in which rotation of the output shaft
in the advancing direction is stopped is
