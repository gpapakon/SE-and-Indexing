<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a lipid carrier system for a local anaesthetic comprising a defined lipid system of at least two lipid components wherein at least one of the lipid components is amphiphatic and polar and one is nonpolar. The system may further contain a hydrophilic solvent and additives or matrices for adapting it for administration to mucous membranes and for transdermal administration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lipid carrier system for a local anaesthetic comprising
a defined lipid system which includes at least two lipid components, wherein at least
one of the lipid components is polar and amphiphatic and one is nonpolar. The system
may further include a hydrophilic solvent and additives or matrices for adapting the
system for administration to mucous membranes and for transdermal administration.Since parenteral administration of bioactive materials often needs to be carried out by
trained physicians or nurses and frequently causes inconveniences for the patients, a lot
of efforts are made on developing drug delivery forms applicable for other routes of
adminstration. Besides oral administration, topical administration such as transdermal
absorption frequently is desirable when a local effect of drug is to be obtained. However,
absorption through biological membranes is a complex process which often requires the
addition of absorption enhancers. There are numerous reports that lipids can contribute
to an improved absorption. It is also well know to person skilled in the art of drug
delivery that bioactive materials successfully can be entrapped in well defined
lipid/aqueous structures called liposomes. From the scientific literature, it is well
established that liposomes can be formed from various lipid derivatives in combination
with amphiphatic compounds, such as phospholipids. The process of forming liposomes
includes a number of steps, as is disclosed by Weiner et al. in Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm.
1989, Vol. 15, 1523 and is therefore both complicated and expensive. Furthermore well
known liposome compositions suffer from the disadvantage that the systems are quite
unstable and factors such as temperature and other constituents may dramatically change
the nature of the liposomes by irreversibly damage their bilayer structure. It is also well
known that liposomes formed from egg yolk phosphatides have a limited stability
during storage. The patent specifications EP 158 441 and WO 87//07502 disclose the
preparation of a dry lipid based material including phospholipids which upon 
reconstitution in an aqueous environment forms liposomes. This material is however,
formed from liposomes which retain their structure in the dry composition and it
consequently requires a complex liposome forming production process
It is therefore need for an equally or more effective lipid composition for drug delivery
which has more simple production process which is capable of delivering a
