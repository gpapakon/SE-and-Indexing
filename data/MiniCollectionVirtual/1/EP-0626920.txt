A device for controlling the packaging-means feed on a sweet-packing machine as a 
function of the degree of filling of the pairs of holding elements of a sweet-conveying 

means, having a pair of draw-off rollers for supplying a packaging-means strip to a 
cutting device, a pair of radial cams comprising congruent cam plates arranged offset 

at 180Â° to each other, and engageable transfer means between the cam plates and the 
pair of draw-off rollers for raising one draw-off roller when a sweet is absent between 

a pair of holding elements, 
characterized in that
 the cam plates (26, 26 [
sic
]) are each 

divided into an inner cam-plate half (26', 27') and an outer cam-plate half (26'', 27'') 
and are constructed in the form of a compact stack of cams (24), the inner halves (26', 

27') and the outer halves (26'', 27'') of the two cam plates (26, 27) are rigidly connected 
to one another in each case, and the inner cam-plate halves (26', 27') are rotatable 

towards each other relative to the outer cam-plate halves (26'', 27'') in order to 
set saddle points (36, 36') formed between the cam plates (26, 27). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the transfer means is in the form 
of a tie rod (12) which is actuable indirectly by the cam plates (26, 27) and which is 

articulated radially to a draw-off roller (5) in such a way, in order to raise the said 
draw-off roller (5),that the longitudinal axis of the tie rod (12) extends substantially at 

right angles to the plane of the packaging-means strip (P) and through the axis of rotation 
of the draw-off roller (5), wherein the tie rod (12) engages on the draw-off roller 

(5) substantially centrally relative to the width of the said draw-off roller (5). 
A device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 cam levers (20, 20') with 
cam rollers (21, 21') are associated respectively with the cam plates (26, 27), wherein 

each cam roller (21 or 21') rolls on the respective cam plate (26 or 27) and cover[s] the 

two cam-plate halves (26', 26'' or 27', 27'') of the associated cam plate (26, 27).  
 
A device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the cam levers (20, 20') are provided 
with stops (22, 22') and are mounted pivotably on a shaft (15), and a holder (16), 

the free end of which is provided with control elements (17, 17') pivotable into the area 
of movement of the stops, is fixed on the shaft (15). 
A device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the front end of the shaft (15) 
has an eccentrically arranged pin (14) with which is associated the tie rod (12) which is 

mounted at one end on the pin (14) and at the other end concentrically on the shaft (10) 
of the draw-off roller (5), centrally with respect to the width of the draw-off roller (5). 
A device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the control elements (17, 
17') are pivotable two-armed levers, one lever arm of which is articulated to one 

respective oscillating armature (18, 18') of a pull magnet (19, 19') and the other lever 
arm of which is pivotable into the area of movement of the stop (22, 22'). 
A device according to at least one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the stops 
(22, 22') are settable. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 
the cam plates (26, 27) are detachably connected to a clamping ring (33) displaceable 

on the shaft (25). 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 
the inner cam-plate halves (26', 27') comprise an elongate hole (29), and a pin 

(30) provided with an eccentric collar (31) is provided, which fixes the outer cam-plate 
halves (26'', 27'') to the clamping ring (33) and which is rotatable from the outside and 

the eccentric collar (31) of which is situated in the elongate hole (29).
