<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thin-film
transistor (to be abbreviated as a TFT hereinafter) and
a display device such as an active matrix type liquid
crystal display device, using the same.TFTs are widely used as switching elements in drive
circuits of various types of devices. For example, in
an active matrix type liquid crystal display device,
each display pixel is selected by a TFT.Generally, a TFT has a source electrode and a drain
electrode formed to be separated from each other, a
semiconductor film formed to electrically contact these
electrodes, a gate insulating film formed on the
semiconductor film, and a gate electrode formed on the
gate insulating film. TFTs of this type can be
classified into a staggered type TFT in which a
semiconductor film, a gate insulating film, and a gate
electrode are sequentially formed on the source and
drain electrodes, and an inverted staggered type TFT in
which a gate insulating film, a semiconductor film, and
source and drain electrodes are sequentially formed on a
gate electrode.In recent years, an increase in ON/OFF current 
ratio is requested in order to render a TFT operable
in a higher frequency range. For this purpose, the
length of a channel corresponding to the semiconductor
film portion between the source and drain electrodes is
attempted to be decreased, thereby increasing the ON/OFF
current ratio. When the semiconductor film of the TFT
is made of a silicide semiconductor represented by
amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), photocarriers are generated
in the semiconductor film upon incidence of light.
Although a decrease in channel length can increase
an ON current Ion, it facilitates movement of the
photocarriers, thereby undesirably increasing an OFF
current, i.e., a photoleakage current Ioff. As a
result, the ON/OFF current ratio is not improved as
expected.Especially, in an active matrix type liquid crystal
display device, generation of the photoleakage current
Ioff directly causes variations in potential of the
pixel electrodes, leading to a degradation in visual
quality of the display image.Therefore, conventionally, countermeasures have
been taken such as formation of a light-shielding layer
made of a metal material, e.g., chromium (Cr), on a
counter substrate which is arranged to oppose an array
substrate on which a plurality of pixel electrodes are
formed. However, this cannot prevent the photoleakage
current Ioff which is caused by the photocarrier
generated in the semiconductor layer of the TFT upon
incidence of light reflected by the surface of
