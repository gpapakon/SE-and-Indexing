<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for
encoding/decoding of background sounds in a digital frame based
speech coder and/or decoder including a signal source connected
to a filter, said filter being defined by a set of filter
defining parameters for each frame, for reproducing the signal
that is to be encoded and/or decoded.Many modern speech coders belong to a large class of speech
coders known as LPC (Linear Predictive Coders). Examples of
coders belonging to this class are: the 4,8 Kbit/s CELP from the
US Department of Defense, the RPE-LTP coder of the European
digital cellular mobile telephone system GSM, the VSELP coder of
the corresponding American system ADC, as well as the VSELP coder
of the Pacific Digital Cellular system PDC.These coders all utilize a source-filter concept in the signal
generation process. The filter is used to model the short-time
spectrum of the signal that is to be reproduced, whereas the
source is assumed to handle all other signal variations.A common feature of these source-filter models is that the signal
to be reproduced is represented by parameters defining the output
signal of the source and filter parameters defining the filter.
The term "linear predictive" refers to a class of methods often
used for estimating the filter parameters. Thus, the signal to be
reproduced is partially represented by a set of filter parameters.The method of utilizing a source-filter combination as a signal
model has proven to work relatively well for speech signals.
However, when the user of a mobile telephone is silent and the 
input signal comprises the surrounding sounds, the presently
known coders have difficulties to cope with this situation, since
they are optimized for speech signals. A listener on the other
side may easily get annoyed when familiar background sounds
cannot be recognized since they have been "mistreated" by the
coder.An object of the present invention is a method and an apparatus
for encoding/decoding background sounds in such a way that
background sounds are encoded and reproduced accurately.The above object is achieved by a method comprising the steps of:
(a) detecting whether the signal that is directed to said
coder/decoder represents primarily speech or background
sounds; and(b) when said signal directed to said coder/decoder represents
primarily background sounds, restricting the
temporal variation between consecutive frames and/or the
domain of at least one filter defining parameter in said
set. The apparatus comprises:
(a) means for
