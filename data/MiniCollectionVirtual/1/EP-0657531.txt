<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conversion of 
halogenated hydrocarbons to halohydrins using 
microorganisms. A large amount of short-chain halogenated 
aliphatic hydrocarbons are produced for use as organic 
solvents, degreasing agents, pesticides, intermediates 
for the synthesis of various other organic compounds and 
as ingredients in the manufacture of plastics. The 
extensive use of these halogenated compounds in 
industrial processes creates a substantial problem in 
the disposal of the waste material. Halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons as a 
byproduct in a chemical process can be burned to produce 
heat, thus, yielding some recovery from a waste product. 
When the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon is released 
into the environment, removal from the environment 
occurs by microbial biodegradation. Biodegradation of 
halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons results in the 
formation of carbon dioxide, water and hydrochloric acid 
when the halogen is a chloride. The biodegradation of halogenated aliphatic 
hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide, water and hydrochloric 
acid by select microorganisms is disclosed in U.S. 
Patents 4,853,334 and 4,877,736. A process for the 
decomposition of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, 
without specifying the microorganism involved is 
described in U.S. Patent 4,749,491. In addition, the  
 
aerobic metabolism of trichloroethylene by Acinetobacter sp. 
has been reported by Nelson et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 
52:383-384 (1986). An overview of the degradation of 
halogenated aliphatic compounds in the environment is 
given in Vogel et al., Environ. Sci. Technol., 21:722-736 
(1987). Rather than burn the halogenated aliphatic 
hydrocarbons or depend on the biodegradation of the 
compound in nature, it would be advantageous to have a 
process whereby the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons 
are converted to a valuable intermediate for use in 
production of other useful products, such as a chemical 
intermediate in preparation of polyethers to form 
polyurethanes or preparation of glycols and polyglycols 
to form lubricants, surfactants, emulsifiers, etc. The present invention provides a biologically 
pure culture of a microorganism of Rhodoccocus species ATCC 
55388 and mutants thereof capable of converting a 
halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon to primary 
halohydrins. In another embodiment the present 
invention is to a process for producing halohydrins 
comprising contacting a halogenated aliphatic 
hydrocarbon with Rhodoccocus species ATCC 55388 or a mutant 
thereof

<CLAIMS>
A biologically pure culture of Rhodococcus 
species ATCC 55388 and mutants thereof capable of 

converting a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon to a 
primary halohydrin. 
A process for producing halohydrins 
comprising contacting a halogenated aliphatic 

hydrocarbon with Rhodoccocus species ATCC 55388 or a mutant 
thereof capable of converting a halogenated aliphatic 

hydrocarbon to a primary halohydrin in a medium which 
does not substantially inhibit the Rhodoccocus species. 
A process for producing halohydrins 
comprising contacting a halogenated aliphatic 

hydrocarbon with a cell-free extract from a Rhodococcus 
species ATCC 55388 or a mutant thereof capable of 

converting a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon to a 
primary halohydrin in a medium which does not 

substantially inhibit enzymes present in the cell-free 
extract of the Rhodoccocus species responsible for the 

dehalogenation. 
The process of any one of Claims 2 or 3 
wherein the aliphatic hydrocarbon is a C₂-C₁₀ saturated 

aliphatic hydrocarbon containing two or more halogen 
groups wherein at least two of the halogens are on 

adjacent carbon atoms. 
The process of Claim 4 wherein the 
halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon is a chlorinated 

aliphatic hydrocarbon. 
The process of Claim 5 wherein the 
chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon is 

 
1,2-dichloropropane, 1,2-dichlorobutane, 

1,2,3-trichloropropane, or a mixture thereof. 
The process of Claim 6 wherein 
1,2,3-trichloropropane is converted to optically active 

2,3-dichloropropanol.

water and an appropriate buffer to maintain a pH of from 
4.0 to 9.5.

cultivating the microorganism in the presence of a 

halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon and a growth medium 
under aerobic conditions to allow conversion of the 

hydrocarbon to a halohydrin.
