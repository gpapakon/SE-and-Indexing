<DESCRIPTION>
 CHEMICAL OXYGEN GENERATING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING Li-Background of the InventionThis invention is broadly concerned with an improved candle for generating breathable oxygen by initiation and decomposition of an alkaline metal chlorate or perchlorate source. During decomposition of the chlorate or perchlorate, toxic free chlorine gas may be evolved. Furthermore, irregular decomposition of the alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate will result in uneven evolution of oxygen.Thus, this invention specifically relates to an oxygen generating alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate candle composition having a non-toxic additive compound incorporated therein which regulates and smooths oxygen decomposition and suppresses formation of toxic free chlorine gas.Description of the Prior ArtChemical oxygen generating candles containing alkali metal chlorates or perchlorates have long been used as an emergency supply of breathable oxygen where weight and space limitations are important factors. Exemplary in this respect are aircraft which fly at high altitudes, submarines, and other closed atmospheric enclosures which house personnel or passengers.Many previous oxygen candles which employed an alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate compound as the oxygen source have utilized barium peroxide (Baθ2) as an additive to smooth out the decomposition rate of the chlorate or perchlorate and to suppress formation of free chlorine which is a toxic gas. A metal oxide catalyst has also commonly been used to facilitate decomposition of the 

oxygen source, and a powdered metal fuel such as iron powder incorporated to furnish the extra heat necessary to help sustain the combustion process. A small portion of glass powder and glass fibers has also been employed as a binder. Although Ba02 performs the function of suppressing free chlorine formation and smoothing oxygen evolution during decomposition of alkali metal chlorate or perchlorate oxygen sources, it is in and of itself a poisonous compound. Unless extraordinary precautions are taken, tiny Baθ2 particles may be released along with the oxygen generated, presenting an immediate health hazard to the person breathing the oxygen being generated and possibly contaminating the surrounding atmosphere as well. Equally as importantly, environmental regulations require the use of costly procedures and equipment to dispose of scraps and expended oxygen candles containing Baθ2.Several alkali metal oxides such as Na20, Na202" and K02 have also been suggested as catalysts for NaC103 decomposition
