<ABSTRACT>
A reversibly adhering contact adhesive (pressure-sensitive adhesive) composition which can be redetached without residue is composed of a mixture of the following components:   a) between 40 and 91 parts by weight of polyacrylate-based copolymer containing hydrophilic groups, which is obtainable from 40 to 70 parts by weight of an alkyl acrylate having 2 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, 10 to 55 parts by weight of a vinylcarboxylic acid and 5 to 20 parts by weight of a hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate, b) between 9.9 and 58 parts by weight of 1,2,3-propanetriol (glycerol), and c) between 0.1 and 2 parts by weight of a crosslinking agent.
