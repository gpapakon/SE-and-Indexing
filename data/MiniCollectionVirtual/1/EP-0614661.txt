<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns novel 
pharmaceutical compositions containing substituted 
benzylidene- and cinnamylidene-malononic acid derivatives 
for specifically inhibiting cell proliferation processes in 
mammals. The invention further provides certain novel 
compounds of the aforesaid type. Currently the chemotherapy of cancer makes use of 
inhibitors of DNA synthesis (examples: adriamycin, 
fluorouracil) and compounds which disrupt the cytoskeleton 
(vinblastine). These compounds are highly toxic since their 
inhibitory activity is not limited to cancer cells, with the 
distinction, however, that tumor cells are more readily 
attacked by the aforesaid inhibitors because these cells 
divide more rapidly and their DNA metabolism is consequently  
 
more active. A few types of cancers are nowadays treated 
with specific pharmaceutical agents. These include, for 
example, certain breast cancers which are hormone dependent 
and can therefore be treated with specific hormone 
derivatives. These cases, however, are the exception and 
the chemotherapeutic treatment for the majority of the 
various types of cancer is non-specific. In the early 1980's it became apparent that 20 to 
30 percent of cancers express characteristic oncogenic 
products which are growth factor receptors or their mutated 
homologs, which exhibit protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) 
activity. The PTK activity is intrinsic to the receptor or 
its oncogene homolog and, which influences the cell 
proliferation via its PTK domain. Furthermore, each of 
these receptors (normal or mutated), exhibits a 
characteristic PTK activity with a distinct substrate 
specificity. One of these receptors is the epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) receptor and its oncogenic homolog v-Erb-b. 
Pursuant to that discovery it has already been proposed to 
treat cancer by means of various chemical substances capable 
of inhibiting the PTK activity of EGF - see, for example, in 
Japanese patents Nos. 6239523, 6242923 and 6242925. It is the object of the present invention to 
provide readily accessible compounds of relatively simple 
structure that are active as specific EGFR-tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors and can thus serve as specific anti-cancer 
agents. The above object is achieved by the present 
invention which provides pharmaceutical compositions 
containing as an active ingredient a compound of the general 
formula (I):  wherein R₁ and R₂ are each independently CN, CONH₂ or COOH 
or one of R₁ and R₂ may be -CSNH₂ or, when R₁ is CN, R₂ can 
also be the group 
R₃ is
