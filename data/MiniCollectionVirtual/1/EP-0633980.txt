<ABSTRACT>
A thermally responsive valve assembly (134) for scroll motor-compressor high temperature protection, which causes a high-side to low-side leak when excessive discharge gas temperatures are encountered, thereby causing the motor protector (35) to trip and de-energize the motor. The valve assembly (134) includes means for ducting (200) the excessive temperature discharge gas to the lower portion of the motor/compressor shell (10) to the motor to circulate the high temperature gas throughout the motor cavity. The excessive temperature discharge gas heats the motor stator (20) and windings (32) which will in turn cause the motor protector (35) to trip and de-energize the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to scroll compressors. A typical scroll compressor has an orbiting scroll 
member having a spiral wrap on one face thereof, a non-orbiting 
scroll member having a spiral wrap on one face 
thereof with said wraps being intermeshed with one another, 
and means for causing said orbiting scroll member to orbit 
about an axis with respect to said non-orbiting scroll 
member, whereby said wraps will create pockets of 
progressively decreasing volume from a suction zone to a 
discharge zone. EP-A-0 375 207, upon which the preamble of claim 1 is 
based, discloses a scroll compressor in which an internal 
chamber pressure is sensed. Control means are provided for 
de-energizing the compressor drive motor if the sensed 
pressure is above or below a predetermined value. It has been discovered that one of the unique 
features of scroll machines is that excessive high 
temperature discharge gas conditions (which result from the 
high pressure ratios caused by many different fieldencountered 
problems) can be solved by providing means to 
cause a high-side to low-side leak during these conditions. EP-A-0 480 560 is relevant to the present case as 
prior art only under Article 54(3) EPC. EP-A-0 480 560 
discloses a scroll compressor in which a thermally 
responsive valve arrangement is provided to provide high 
temperature protection. The valve arrangement is arranged 
to cause a high-side to low-side leak through a passage 
when excessive gas discharge temperatures are encountered, 
thereby causing the motor protector to trip so as to de-energize 
the drive motor. The valve arrangement leaks gas 
from the high-side to the low-side through a passage 
provided either in the non-orbiting scroll member or in a 
partition between the high-side and low-side of the 
compressor. The downstream side of the passage may be 
provided with a short L-shaped plastic extension tube to 
carry leaked gas closer to the motor space.  
 According to the present invention there is provided 
a scroll compressor comprising: 
a hermetic shell having a motor cavity; an orbiting scroll member disposed in said shell and 
having a first spiral wrap on one face thereof; a non-orbiting scroll member disposed in said shell 
and having a second spiral wrap on one face thereof, said 
wraps being intermeshed with one another; a motor having a motor stator, said motor disposed in 
said motor cavity of said shell for causing said orbiting 
scroll member to orbit about an axis with respect to said 
non-orbiting scroll member
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A scroll compressor comprising: 

a hermetic shell (10) having a motor cavity; 
an orbiting scroll member (40) disposed in said shell 
and having a first spiral wrap (44) on one face thereof; 
a non-orbiting scroll member (56) disposed in said 
shell and having a second spiral wrap on one face thereof, 

said wraps being intermeshed with one another; 
a motor (20,34) having a motor stator (20), said 
motor disposed in said motor cavity of said shell for 

causing said orbiting scroll member (40) to orbit about an 
axis with respect to said non-orbiting scroll member (56) 

whereby said wraps will create pockets of progressively 
decreasing volume from a suction zone to a discharge zone; 

and 
means (17) for introducing suction gas into said 
shell (10) ; 
 
   characterised in that the compressor further 

comprises: 

passage means (200) defining a passageway having an 
inlet end and an outlet end, said passageway being in fluid 

communication at its inlet end with a valve means (134) and 
extending into the motor cavity to terminate at its outlet 

end adjacent said motor stator, said valve means (134) 
being for controlling gas flow through said passage means 

(200) and operating in response to a sensed condition to 
switch from a normally closed condition to an open 

condition to open said passage means and thereby permit the 
leakage of compressed gas via said passageway from said 

discharge zone to said suction zone to an area adjacent 
said motor stator (20); and 
in said suction zone a thermal protector (35) 
associated with said motor (20,34) for de-energizing said 

motor when said thermal protector reaches a predetermined 
excessive temperature, and wherein said leakage of
