<ABSTRACT>
In a blended resin composition comprising a general 
polyester and a liquid crystal polyester resin, the 

liquid crystal polyester resin is fibrillated in the 
molding step to obtain a resin composition having 

excellent mechanical strength etc. The present invention 
relates to a synthetic resin composition comprising 100 

parts by weight of a resin component composed of 99 to 
50 parts by weight of a polyester resin (a) not forming 

an anisotropic melt phase and 1 to 50 parts by weight of 
a liquid crystal polyester resin (b) capable of forming 

an anisotropic melt phase as well as 0.01 to 0.5 parts by 
weight of a phosphorus compound (c), said liquid crystal 

polyester resin (b) capable of forming an anisotropic 
melt phase is fibrillated to an aspect ratio of 6 or 

more in the molding step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a blended resin compositon
comprising a polyester resin not forming an anisotropic
melt phase and a liquid crystal polyester resin as well
as a product of molding thereof.A liquid crystal polyester resin (LCP) capable of
forming an anisotropic melt phase is a thermoplastic
resin having many characteristics such as high strength,
high rigidity, high thermal resistance and easy
moldability, but there are also commercial disadvantages
such as mold shrinkage and mechanical properties being
different from each other between the molecular chain
orientation and the directions vertical thereto as well as the
price being high.On one hand, a polycarbonate resin such as a
polycarbonate resin (PC) etc. not forming an anisotropic
melt phase is relatively cheap, but physical properties
thereof such as rigidity are inferior to that of a liquid
crystal polyester, which is a disadvantage.
Particularly, rigidity is insufficient for use in a thin
housing, so that thickening should be made from the
viewpoint of designing. There are thus some limitations 
regarding the present miniaturizing and
weight-reducing trends in electric, electronic and
communication machinery fields.Thus, in order to make a good use of the advantages
of LCP and the polyester resin not forming an
anisotropic melt phase, there was tried to mix
them for compensating their disadvantages. However, in
an injection molded product made from a resin
composition wherein a small quantity of LCP is blended
with a polyester resin not forming an anisotropic melt
phase, characteristics of LCP such as high strength,
high rigidity, high thermal resistance and easy
moldability are not made of a good use, so that
mechanical strength decreases markedly. The cause
thereof is that high mechanical properties of LCP are
obtained due to molecular orientation by being subjected
to shear stress and tensile stress. That is, in a resin
composition obtained by only blending a polyester resin
not forming an anisotropic melt phase and a small
quantity of LCP, although molecules are orientated in
parts near the surface layer of the product, parts other
than the surface layer have a form wherein the polyester
resin not forming an anisotropic melt phase being a
matrix and almost all LCP being just dispersed
spherically without any reinforcing effect. That is,
only after LCP is fibrillated within a product of
molding, LCP is molecularly orientated in the direction 
of length in a fibrous form to become a form with
reinforcing effect.On the other hand, if the
