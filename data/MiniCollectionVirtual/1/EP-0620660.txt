<ABSTRACT>
A technique employing a depolarized optical source to reduce the polarization 
dependent gain associated with the optical pump signal used to excite doped fiber 

amplifiers within an optical transmission system. Pumping the doped fiber amplifiers with 
a signal that has no single predominant linear SOP, equalizes the gain of the amplifiers. 

A particular embodiment of the invention includes a pump comprised of a passive 
polarization scrambler coupled to the output of a multifrequency optical laser. The simple, 

passive arrangement keeps overall system costs to a minimum and increases reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
Very long optical fiber transmission paths, such as those employed in 
undersea or transcontinental terrestrial lightwave transmission systems that employ optical 
amplifier repeaters, are subject to decreased performance due to a host of impairments that 
increase as a function of the length of the optical fiber comprising the transmission path. 
Typically, in such long optical transmission systems, these impairments vary with time and 
cause a random fluctuation in the signal-to-noise ratio ("SNR") of the transmission path. 
This random fluctuation contributes to a phenomenon known as signal fading. Signal 
fading can result in an increased bit error rate ("BER") for digital signals transmitted via 
the optical fiber path. When the SNR of a digital signal within such a transmission system 
becomes unacceptably small (resulting in an undesirably high BER), a signal fade is said 
to have occurred. Experimental evidence has shown that signal fading and SNR 
fluctuations are caused by several polarization dependent effects induced by the optical 
fiber itself and/or other optical components (e.g., repeaters, amplifiers, etc.) along the 
transmission path. In general, these effects result from the anisotropic transmission 
characteristics of the optical components and fiber within a transmission system. For 
example, anisotropic loss or gain as a function of signal polarization. Doped fiber amplifiers (such as the erbium-doped fiber amplifiers typically 
employed as repeaters within long-haul optical fiber transmission systems) can exhibit 
anisotropic gain as signal polarization is varied. This is a newly identified mechanism of 
transmission anisotropy called polarization dependent gain ("PDG"). PDG has two 
components; one is associated with the signal passing through the doped fiber amplifier, 
and the other with the optical pump signal used to excite the doped fiber amplifier. To 
distinguish between these two, the latter is designated PDGPUMP. PDGPUMP is the active 
component counterpart to polarization dependent loss ("PDL"), a well-known phenomenon 
that causes anisotropic losses within passive components. PDGPUMP arises from the random 
orientation of dopant ions within the glass matrix of the fiber amplifier, and the selective 
excitation of these ions by a linearly polarized pump laser. The gain of the doped fiber 
amplifier induced by this pumping is larger for signals having a linear state of polarization 
("SOP") parallel to the SOP of a linearly polarized pumping signal. Ideally, all PDGPUMP
