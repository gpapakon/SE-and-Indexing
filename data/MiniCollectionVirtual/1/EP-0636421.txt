<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a dispenser (10) for dispensing 
medications into the nostril or intravenously. The device has a number of 

advantageous features. First, the device includes air grooves (100) in the spray 
head to allow the drawing in of air into the nostril during dispensing, to assist in 

the intake of the dispensed medication. Second, the device contains a mechanism 
(200, 400-405) for varying the amount of the dose dispensed. This feature is 

advantageous in that it allows an accurate metered dose to be dispensed, while 
still allowing flexibility in the size of the dose dispensed. The device can also 

have indicia (701, 702, 703) for indicating when the last dose was dispensed, and 
can include a disinfecting feature (150) for the spray head. The device can also 

have a gripping feature (901) which spaces the fingers (F) from the nostril into 
which medication is dispensed. The device includes a pump (P) in the outer 

package, so that it may be used with conventional medication packaging (12). 
Finally, the device is adapted to be used for both nasal and intravenous 

dispensing, via a replaceable spray passage (201) or injection needle (202). The 
package is preferably clear so that the user can determine the quality of the 

medication being dispensed. The device is particularly useful for dispensing 
medications such as insulin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dispensing package which allows both
nasal and intravenous dispensing. The invention is particularly useful for
dispensing medications in accurate metered quantities into the body and allows
an end user to adjust the quantity of material dispensed in each metered dose.
Because the dispensing pump is mounted on the operating device, the invention
can be used with conventional containers used to hold medications for
intravenous injection. One type of medication which the present invention is
particularly useful for dispensing is insulin, which may be administered in accurate
metered doses either nasally or intravenously with the device of the present
invention. Furthermore, because the pump is not mounted in the container, it
may be reused -- requiring less waste than a conventional container with a pump
which is thrown away with the container when the container is emptied.U.S. Patent No. 3,254,803 shows a device for dispensing quantities of liquid
in the form of a spray into a nasal cavity. The device of this patent uses an
aerosol container mounted in a dispensing package for dispensing a metered
quantity of liquid. The device of U.S. Patent No. 3,254,80203 does not, however,
allow a user to select or vary the quantity of liquid delivered with each dose, since 
the amount delivered is dependent upon the structure of the
metering valve within the aerosol container.U.S. Patent No. 3211346 shows a device for
dispensing liquid under the action of a pump, in which the
pump is mounted to a non-vented container pressurized by a
quantity of inert gas. This type of device, in which the
material to be dispensed does not come into contact with
air until it exists the spray head, is particularly useful
for dispensing medications, which could degrade if placed
in contact with the air used to vent a conventional piston-operated
dispensing pump. The device of U.S. Patent No.
3211346 does not contain any mechanism for limiting the
length of the stroke of the pump. The only metered
quantity that this pump can dispense is that quantity that
comes when the pump is depressed through its full stroke.EP-A-0509863 discloses a device for dispensing
liquid, contained in a container, under the action of a
pump which has a hollow operating stem extending from one
end of the container. The container is longitudinally
slidable in a housing and the operating stem of the pump is
engageable in an internal recess in a closure applied to
one end of the housing. The closure has a dispensing
passage
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device (10) for dispensing metered quantities of
material as either liquid or spray comprising;


a container (12) holding a quantity of material to
be dispensed;
a pump(P) for dispensing material from an interior
of said container (12), said pump(P) including a pump stem

(13) for delivering liquid from said pump(P) to an exterior
of said container (12);
a housing (14) including a spray passage (20),
(21), said pump stem (13) engaging said spray passage (20),

(21)
and said container (12) being mounted for reciprocal movement in

said housing (14); and characterised in that; it further
comprises
a pump stroke limiting device,
comprising a washer (200) adapted to be mounted on

said pump stem (13) between said container (12) and said
housing (14), such that said washer (200) contacts a

portion of said container (12) adjacent said pump stem
(13), to thereby limit an amount of reciprocal movement of

said container (12) in said housing (14), the washer (200)
being replaceable with one of a plurality of other washers

(202,203), each said washer being of a different thickness.
A device according to claim 1, further comprising:

a driving piston (301) connected to said container
(12) and mounted for reciprocal movement in said housing

(14), whereby force applied to said driving piston (301)
reciprocates said container (12) in said housing (14).
A device according to claim 2, wherein:
 
   said washers (200, 202, 203) may be stored on said

driving piston (301).
A device according to any of the proceeding claims,
wherein:

   said housing further comprises a spray nozzle
(19), said spray nozzle (19) communicating with said pump

stem spray passage (20,21).
