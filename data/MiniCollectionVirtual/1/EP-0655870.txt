<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a communication system with a control device (1) provided for performing services. The control device (1), after receiving parameters sent by a terminal (6), is provided for taking a service logic program from a data bank (3) and, in dependence on a service logic program and second parameters, for activating a service and, in dependence on a service logic program and first parameters, for providing a service for a subscriber and for transmitting at least one service parameter to the terminal (6, 8) and/or, in dependence on a service logic program and fourth parameters, for deleting the authorisation for participating in a service for a subscriber.

<CLAIMS>
A communication system comprising a controller (1, 13) arranged for
service implementation, which controller is arranged for


extracting a service logical program from a database (3, 15) after the controller has
received parameters consisting of various digits transmitted by a terminal unit (6, 8), and
activating a service in response to a service logical program and second parameters
and,
changing service parameters in response to a service logical program and third
parameters consisting of various digits,
providing a service for a subscriber in response to a service logical program and
first parameters and for transmitting at least one service parameter to the terminal unit (6, 8)

and/or, in response to a service logical program and fourth parameters, for deleting a
subscriber's authorization to use a service.
A communication system as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
controller (1, 13) is arranged for


extracting the third service logical program and for requesting an identification once
a service change number has been dialed by a terminal unit (6, 8),
requesting the prompt about the intended change of at least one service parameter
from the terminal unit (6, 8) after a positive result of an identification check, and
storing the changed, received service parameters.
A communication system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

the controller (1, 13) is arranged for

extracting the first service logical program after a service access number has been
dialed by a terminal unit (6, 8),
requesting an identification after a subscriber-specific registration number has been
received, 
transmitting the service number, the service change number and the service delete
number to the terminal unit (6, 8) after a positive result of the identification check.
A communication system as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the controller (1, 13) is arranged for

extracting the fourth service logical program and for requesting an identification
after a terminal unit (6, 8) has dialed a service delete number,
deleting the subscriber-specific telephone numbers and service parameters
necessary for rendering the service available after a positive result of the identification

check.
A communication system as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the controller (1, 13) is arranged for extracting the second service
logical program used for activating a service used for service implementation after a service

number has been dialed by a terminal unit (6, 8).
A communication system as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 the controller (1, 13) is coupled to a database (3, 15) and at least one
switch (4, 12), 
in that
 a switch (4, 12) is arranged for conveying received telephone
numbers and/or service parameters to the controller (1, 13) and for receiving control

commands from the controller (1, 13).
A communication system as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the
controller (13), the switch (12) and the database (15) form part of a service facility (9)

which is coupled to at least one terminal unit (8) 
via
 a communication network (7).
A communication system as claimed in Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that
 a
speech processor (5, 16) is coupled to a switch (4, 12) and a controller (1, 13), which

speech processor is arranged for

speech recognition of a message received 
via
 a switch (4, 12),
conveying the message to the controller (1, 13),
forming a prompt from a message transmitted by the controller (1, 13), and
applying the formed prompt to the switch (4, 12).
A controller (1, 13) for implementing services which controller is arranged
for


extracting a service logical program from a database (3, 15) after parameters
consisting of various digits sent by a terminal unit (6, 8) have been received, and
activating a service in response to a service logical program and second parameters
consisting of various digits, and
changing service parameters in response to a service logical program and third
parameters consisting of various digits,
providing a service for a subscriber in response to a service logical program and
first parameters and for transmitting at least one service parameter to the terminal unit (6, 8)

and/or, in response to a service logical program and fourth parameters, for deleting a
subscriber's authorization to use a service.
A service facility (9) comprising a controller (13) arranged for carrying out
services, which controller is arranged for


extracting a service logical program from a database (3, 15) after parameters
consisting of various digits sent by a terminal unit (6, 8) have been received, and
activating a service in response to a service logical program and second parameters,
and
changing service parameters in response to a service logical program and third
parameters, and
providing a service for a subscriber in response to a service logical program and
first parameters and for transmitting at least one service parameter to the terminal unit (6, 8)

and/or for deleting a subscriber's authorization to use a service in response to a service
logical program and fourth parameters, and comprising a switch (12) for conveying

received telephone numbers and/or service parameters to the controller (13) and for
receiving control commands from the controller (13) while being coupled thereto.
