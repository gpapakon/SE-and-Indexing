<DESCRIPTION>
Poly(vinyl fluoride) (PVF) is used in film form for a variety of 
protective and decorative applications. The polymerization of vinyl fluoride (VF) has typically been 
carried out in water by means of a water soluble initiator such as 2,2'-azobis(isobutyroamidine) 
dihydrochloride to yield a highly fluid aqueous 
dispersion or slurry of very finely divided polymer particles. Polymerizations 
of this type, in which the initiator is water soluble and the monomer has 
limited water solubility, are often termed emulsion polymerizations. It is 
well known in the art of emulsion polymerization that the addition of surface 
active substances, or emulsifiers, the molecules of which are composed of 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, improve the polymerization process. 
The improvement may be accomplished by better distribution of monomer 
within the aqueous phase, making it more available to the initiator, thus 
facilitating polymerization, or by stabilizing the dispersion of polymer 
particles, allowing more concentrated slurry to be produced without 
formation of large polymer agglomerations, or by a combination of both 
effects. The use of an emulsifier, therefore, offers advantages in productivity 
and economics. The emulsifier, may, in general, have a hydrophilic segment 
that is cationic, anionic or nonionic in nature, while the hydrophobic 
segment is often alkyl or alkaryl in nature. To be compatible with 2,2'-azobis(isobutyroamidine) 
dihydrochloride the emulsifier cannot be anionic 
in nature lest it form an insoluble complex salt with the initiator. Such salts 
have been found to be ineffective initiators for the polymerization process. 
A variety of nonionic and cationic emulsifiers are commercially available 
and are known to be useful in emulsion polymerization. Examples of many 
such materials are described in D. C. Blackley, "Emulsion Polymerization", 
Halsted Press, New York, N.Y., 1975, pp 308-318. The nonionic materials 
almost invariably contain hydrophilic segments derived from oligomers of 
ethylene oxide. While these emulsifiers are compatible with the 2,2'-azobis(isobutyroamidine) 
dihydrochloride initiator, they invariably produce 
low yields of low molecular weight PVF products that are not useful in  
 
typical applications for PVF. Common cationic emulsifiers such as dodecylammonium 
chloride or cetyl pyridiniulll chloride, specified by Blackley as useful in polymerizations 
for producing positively charged particles, are compatible with 
2,2'-azobis(isobutyroamine)
