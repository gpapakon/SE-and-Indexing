<ABSTRACT>
In a corner reduction device for reducing side 
corners of a slab (8) with corner rolls, a pair of 

upper and lower corner rolls (112, 114) are mounted 
inside a unitary unit frame (116), and a corner roll 

unit (110) housing the unitary frame (116) which is 
movable in the direction of width and vertical 

direction of the material (8) is formed. Vertical 
position of the corner roll unit (110) is controlled 

by a lifting power control cylinder (144) through a 
push rod (132) and position in direction of material 

width is controlled by a reduction cylinder (122). 
Drive of cylinder servo valves (445a, 445b) are 

controlled in accordance with position set values set 
by position setters (441a, 441b), load set values set 

by load setters (443a, 443b), and feedback signals 
from position sensors (448a, 448b), thereby 

controlling the corner roll positions to fixed 
lateral and vertical positions. The drive of the 

servo valves (445a, 445b) are corrected according to 
values detected by cylinder pressure sensors (449a, 

449b), to evenly reduce the right and left corners of 
the material (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a corner reduction 
device for rolling equipment for reducing side 
corners of a material by the use of corner rolls, a 
control device thereof, and a method of rolling the 
material by the use of these devices. Generally there is a necessity of performing a 
roughing process prior to a finish rolling process in 
order to produce rolled plates such as hot-rolled 
slabs by rolling to specific width and thickness. In a conventional equipment for performing the 
aforesaid roughing process, as schematically shown as 
one example in Fig. 1, a rolling equipment 3 
comprising an edging mill (edger) 1 and a horizontal 
mill (mill) 2 is arranged in multiple stages along a 
pass line L, and a carrying table 5 having a 
multitude of carrying rolls (table rolls) 4 arranged 
in both the front and rear positions of each of the 
rolling equipment 3. Furthermore, side guides 6 so 
formed as to avoid interference of each carrying roll 
4 are arranged on the right and left sides of the 
pass line L, facing each other, above the carrying 
table 5. On the back surface of each carrying table 
5, a cylinder 7 as a space controlling device is 
provided. A material 8 such as a slab to be conveyed 
on the carrying table 5 is guided to the rolling 
equipment 3 while its position is being restricted by 
the right and left side guides 6, then being 
repetitively rolled for reduction to specific width 
and thickness by the edging mills 1 and the 
horizontal mills 2. A reference numeral 9 denotes 
right and left table frames constituting the carrying  
 
table 5, and a reference numeral 10 expresses a 
bearing of the carrying roll 4. In this roughing process, generally, a material is 
passed through the horizontal mill and the edging 
mill for a plurality of times to produce a sheet bar. 
It is known that a slab 8 (a material to be rolled) 
shown in the top view of Fig. 2A, when horizontally 
rolled in the reverse pass of the roughing process as 
shown in the middle view of Fig. 2A, spreads in the 
direction of width, causing the side faces of the 
material to be subjected to bulging. Subsequently, 
with the edging of the side faces 8E of the slab 8 as 
shown in the bottom view of Fig. 2A, the corners 8C 
of the side faces of the material curve around 
towards the material surface. Consequently, the 
corners 8C are not fully reduced by the rolls as 
compared with other portions of the material, 
resulting in insufficiently smoothing of wrinkled or 
cracked portions. The corners 8C of the side faces
