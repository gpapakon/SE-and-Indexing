<ABSTRACT>
An electrolyzer having a partition plate produced by 
forming thin plates. The electrolyzer includes a vertical 

electrolyzer unit which has a partition plate formed by 
superimposing a pair of anode- (2) and cathode(3)-side partitions 

provided with mutually fittable recesses (5,7) and projections (6,8), 
and an electrode plate (9,10) connected to the projections on each 

side of the partition plate to define an electrolytic 
chamber. A gas-liquid separating chamber (11) having a discharge 

opening is provided in the upper part of the electrolyzer 
unit such that the cross-sectional area of the gas-liquid 

separating chamber is larger at a part closer to the 
discharge opening than at a part remoter from the discharge 

opening, thereby preventing the fluctuation of pressure in 
the electrolytic chamber caused by pulsation occurring in 

the gas-liquid separating chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to filter-press 
electrolyzers and, more particularly, to a filter-press 
electrolyzer which is characterized by the arrangement of 
partitions that divide the electrolyte between a pair of 
adjacent electrode chambers. Filter-press electrolyzers are widely used for the 
electrolytic production of organic substances, the 
electrolysis of brine, etc., including the production of 
chlorine and caustic soda by the electrolysis of salt. Filter-press electrolyzers used for the electrolysis of 
salt, which is a typical example of electrolytic processes 
that use a filter-press electrolyzer, include two different 
types, that is, a bipolar filter-press electrolyzer and a 
monopolar filter-press electrolyzer. The bipolar filter-press 
electrolyzer is arranged as follows: A multiplicity 
of bipolar electrolyzer units, which are formed by 
electrically and mechanically connecting together a pair of 
anode and cathode chambers divided by a partition, are 
stacked with a cation-exchange membrane interposed between 
each pair of adjacent units. Further, an end electrode 
chamber unit having an anode on one side thereof is stacked 
on one end of the stack of the electrolyzer units, while an 
end electrode chamber having a cathode on one side thereof 
is stacked on the other end, and the resulting stack is 
fixed by a hydraulic press or other similar device. The  
 
monopolar filter-press electrolyzer is constructed such that 
a multiplicity of anode chamber units and cathode chamber 
units, each having the same electrode on each side of an 
electrode chamber frame, are stacked with a cation-exchange 
membrane interposed between each pair of adjacent units, and 
an electrode chamber unit having an anode on one side 
thereof is stacked on one end of the stack of the units, 
while an electrode chamber unit having a cathode on one side 
thereof is stacked on the other end of the stack. The 
electrode chamber units in the monopolar filter-press 
electrolyzer are each provided with downcomers, ribs, etc. 
for reinforcing the electrode chamber frame and also for 
promoting the circulation of the electrolyte, and the 
electrodes are attached to the ribs or the like. Usually, 
these electrode chamber units have no partition for dividing 
the electrolyte. On the other hand, the electrode chamber units of the 
bipolar filter-press electrolyzer are provided with 
partitions for dividing the anode and cathode chambers and 
also for transmitting the electrolytic current. Diaphragms

which has a partition plate formed by superimposing a pair 

of anode- and cathode-side partitions provided with mutually 
fittable recesses and projections, and an electrode plate 

connected to the projections on each side of said partition 
plate to define an electrolytic chamber, and which further 

has in an upper part thereof a gas-liquid separating chamber 
for an electrolyte which is formed from a member integral 

with each of said partitions,
 
   wherein the area of a cross-section of said gas-liquid 

separating chamber taken along a plane perpendicular to a 
flow passage inside said gas-liquid separating chamber which 

leads to a discharge opening is larger at a part closer to 
said discharge opening than at a part remoter from said 

discharge opening. 
An electrolyzer according to Claim 1, which further has 
in a lower part of said electrolyzer unit an electrolyte 

dispersing and feeding chamber formed from a member integral 
with each of said partitions. 
An electrolyzer according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein an 
outer surface of said gas-liquid separating chamber or said 

electrolyte dispersing and feeding chamber forms a flange 
surface for stacking said electrolyzer unit on another 

electrolyzer unit. 
An electrolyzer according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
passages are provided between said gas-liquid separating 

chamber and said electrolytic chamber and between said  
 

electrolyte dispersing and feeding chamber and said 
electrolytic chamber to provide communication between these 

chambers.

wherein the mutually fittable recesses and projections 

formed on the anode- and cathode-side partitions in said 
vertical electrolyzer unit are elongated recesses and 

elongated projections, which extend vertically of said 
electrolyzer unit, said recesses and projections being 

formed in a plurality of regions divided in the direction of 
height of said electrolyzer unit such that the elongated 

recesses in one region in each pair of adjacent regions and 
the elongated projections in the other region lie on the 

same straight lines, and communicating portions are provided 
between each pair of adjacent regions to provide 

communication between the adjacent elongated recesses in the 
same region and also provide communication between the 

elongated recesses in each pair of adjacent regions.
