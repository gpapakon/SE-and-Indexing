<ABSTRACT>
The rotating jet assembly (1), esp. for watery liquids. to be sprayed at the walls and side walls of containers, has a jet housing (2) with an inner zone (4) and a liq. inlet (11). A drilling (6) leads outwards from the inner zone, and forms an axial bearing surface (8) in the inner zone (4), extending into a radial bearing surface. A rotating shaft (17) in the drilling has a projecting axial bearing shoulder in the inner zone (4) acting with the axial bearing surface (8), to form an axial sliding bearing (23) to give a friction brake controlled by the liq. pressure. A jet head (22), outside the housing (2), is keyed to the shaft (17), and has at least one jet drilling (41), to emerge radially from the jet head for the liq., in relation to the shaft, to deliver it from the jet (1). The fluid flow is through a channel system (33,34,42) between the inlet (11) through the shaft (17) to the jet head (22). A drive (13) turbine, acting directly on the shaft (17) and without any gearing, is powered by the liq. flow pressure at the inlet (11) to drive the shaft (17). At least one axial bearing surface (8) is of PTFE

Rotating nozzle (1), in particular for aqueous fluids,

with a nozzle housing (2) having an inner chamber (4) into which a
fluid inlet (11) opens,
with a bearing bore (6) in the nozzle housing (2), leading outwards
from the inner space and forming in the inner chamber (4) an axial

bearing face (8) which merges into a cylindrical radial bearing face
leading out of the inner chamber (4),
with a shaft (17) rotatably mounted in the bearing bore and leading
out of the inner chamber (4), the shaft having in the inner chamber

(4) a radially outwardly projecting axial bearing shoulder (19)
which co-operates with the axial bearing face (8) of the bearing

bore (6) and forms with the latter an axial bearing (23), the axial
bearing (23) acting as a friction brake controlled by the fluid

pressure,
with a nozzle head (22) which is seated on the shaft (17) outside the
housing (2) to rotate with the shaft and contains at least one nozzle

bore (41) from which the fluid emerges out of the nozzle (1) with a
radial component in relation to the shaft (17),
with a channel arrangement (33, 34, 42) contained within the shaft

inlet (11) for flow, and 
with a driving device (13) coupled directly to the shaft (17) and

from the nozzle (1) and generates a driving force for the shaft (17)
dependent on the pressure of the fluid at the fluid inlet (11).

Nozzle according to claim 2, characterised in that the surfaces on

the turbine (13) and shaft (17) leading to an axial force derived from the
fluid pressure are of such dimensions in relation to the effective axial

bearing surface that on operation at low pressures there arises within the
axial bearing (23) a fluid lubrication which vanishes with increasing

pressure.
