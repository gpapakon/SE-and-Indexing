<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anticorrosive pigments and to paint compositions, 
adhesive compositions and other protective coatings and pretreatment 
compositions including said pigments. Many of the currently-used anticorrosive pigments have deep colours and this 
necessitates an increase in the thickness and number of finishing coats 
which have to be applied to the surface to be protected. Moreover, some of 
the known anticorrosive pigments, especially those derived from lead and 
chromium, are inherently toxic and hence environmentally unacceptable. Several types of light-coloured, non-toxic pigments have been proposed, 
including zinc phosphate, zinc molybdate and barium metaborate, but these 
have been found to have shortcomings when compared with pigments derived 
from lead and chromium. Protective coatings containing anticorrosive pigments are used to inhibit 
the formation of rust, to inhibit loss of metal by corrosion and to inhibit 
the formation of corrosion products on the surface to be protected and 
consequently to improve paint adhesion and to improve the adhesion of the 
pretreatment composition to the surface to be protected. We have now found that pigments derived from certain organic phosphoric 
acids and organic phosphonic acids, give improved corrosion inhibition when 
used in paint compositions and adhesive compositions. In particular we have found that substantially water insoluble polyvalent 
metal salts of phosphono carboxylic acids are especially useful as corrosion 
resistant pigments. Water soluble salts of phosphonocarboxylic acids are known to be 
particularly useful for the preparation of water treatment agents that 
inhibit scale formation and/or corrosion of metal e.g. iron, surfaces by  
 
aqueous systems, such as boiler water, and are effective when present in 
very low concentrations e.g. 0.1 to 100 ppm. Such agents, on account of the minimum concentrations required for effective 
action, are known as threshold agents. The threshold levels are typically 
very much lower than would be required to achieve useful protection by a 
stoichiometric reagent such as a classical chelating agent. One group of compounds, which has been reported to show scale and corrosion 
inhibiting properties, are the water soluble salts of phosphonosuccinic 
acid. These are not, however, sufficiently effective to have enjoyed 
significant commercial success. A particularly successful threshold scale inhibitor is the sodium salt of 
2-phosphono-1,2,4 - tricarboxybutane which will be referred to
