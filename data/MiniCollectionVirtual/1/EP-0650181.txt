<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for releasably clamping a substrate to a support 
platform, or other support means, at a face of the substrate is described. 

In one embodiment, a retractable clamp (30) 
holds a substrate (2) near its edges on 

a support platform (22) when the clamp is in 
its fully extended position. Oneor 

more leaf springs are mounted to the clamp and apply force to the substrate 
at respective points in the event the substrate adheres to the clamp, thereby 

releasing the substrate from the clamp. In a preferred embodiment of the 
present invention, one or more activators are positioned in cooperative 

relationship to the leaf springs to cause the leaf springs to retract into 
recesses in the clamp when the clamp is extended against the substrate. In 

their retracted position, the leaf springs do not contact the substrate so as to 
minimize the generation of particle contamination and the chance of the 

release leaf springs themselves adhering to the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor wafer 
processing and, in particular to apparatus and methods for releasably 
clamping wafers to support platforms in semiconductor processing 
equipment. In the semiconductor wafer and substrate processing fields 
various types of processing equipment are now commonplace which 
provide for automated handling of wafers in a vacuum environment. A 
paramount concern in the handling and processing of such wafer substrates 
is the need to minimize particle generation that could contaminate the 
wafers damaging the devices being formed thereon. For this reason, most 
semiconductor device fabrication is conducted within a "clean room" 
environment where extreme measures are taken to minimize the presence of 
particulate matter. It is known that the mechanical movement of machine parts 
is responsible for generation of unwanted particles and, accordingly, the 
movement of various automated wafer transport and stationing mechanisms 
within wafer processing equipment is carefully controlled. Many types of 
wafer processing equipment are designed to process wafers individually, 
i.e., one at a time or serially, as opposed to batch processing. In such 
equipment, wafers are typically loaded in the processing system by a 
cassette and individually and automatically transferred from the cassette to 
one or more processing stations. A number of systems have recently been 
developed with a plurality of processing stations housed within a single 
vacuum environment. The stations may perform processing steps such as, 
for example, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma etching, 
heating, etc. These systems typically include one or more load-lock  
 
chambers where the wafers are introduced and removed from the vacuum 
environment. In so-called "cluster tool" systems, the wafers are typically 
transferred by means, such as robot arms, between the load-lock chamber 
and the process stations within the vacuum environment. At a process station, it may be necessary to hold the wafer 
firmly against a support surface with a clamp during processing, such as 
for example to maintain the position of the wafer relative to the processing 
equipment or to maintain good thermal contact to a heat transfer element. 
A common technique for maintaining the temperature of a wafer 
undergoing processing in a vacuum environment is to introduce a 
conductive gas in a narrow space at the backside of the wafer, thereby 
thermally coupling the wafer to a temperature control element.
