<ABSTRACT>
A device for straightening and drying hair comprising 
two facing rotating belts (1,2), to which sets of brushes (4) are 

applied which straighten the hair, and means (7,9) suitable to 
carry out at the same time the hair drying, where said 

two belts are moved by two pinions (3,8) at the same speed but 
in opposed directions, so that the facing parts of the 

two belts slide parallely and in the same direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention proposes a device for straightening and
drying hair.More precisely, the device according to the invention
consists of two plates, around which as many tracks, or
belts, rotate to which brushes are applied, which,
thanks to their movement, keep the hair straightened and
comb it, an air diffuse being also foreseen to dry the
hair together with the action of said brushes.At present manual devices are known to straighten hair
(straightening plates), which are made up of small
pliers, in which at least one of the ribs contains an
electric resistance capable of heating its external
surface.By inserting a lock of hair between the plier's ribs and
making it slide inside it, starting from the join of the
hair and up to its tip, the hair is subjected to a
tension which causes it to be straightened, owing also
to the pliers high temperature.By repeating the operation on all the locks of hair a
complete straightening is obtained, an operation which
must be carried out on perfectly dry hair. It is however
apparent how, to carry out the above described
operation, it is necessary to employ a person who, after 
drying the hair, operates the pliers and inserts from
time to time the locks into the pliers; these are
operations which take a long time and anyway a longer
time the thicker is the hair to be straightened.Another inconvenience of the above described pliers
consists in that, even though the operator is skilful,
it is impossible to get a perfect result, with perfectly
straight and sleek hair. 
Devices for drying and styling the hair are known from
US-A-3894547, which discloses a combination of a hot air
blower with a rotatable comb and from FR-A-2297015,
which discloses a hair dryer combined with a rotatable
brush or an endless brushed belt. The device according to the invention aims at solving
said inconveniences by means of the use of two rotating
belts, equipped with suited brushes, between which the
hair is inserted.The two belts have the same operating speed but
different lenght and the rows of brushes fixed to these
belts are spaced out, being the distance between the
lower rows different from the distance between the upper
rows.The device according to the invention also foresees a
hot air diffuser which dries the hair while this is kept
straightened by said brushes fixed to said belts, thus
obtaining the straightening of the whole hair at the
same time and doing away with burning risks.The hot air flow is preferably directed from lower plate
toward upper plate.The device according to the

the hair for carrying out the drying at the same

time.
A device, according to claim 1, characterized by the
fact that the two rotating belts have the same speed but

different length and in that the brushes fixed to these
belts are placed along spaced out rows, being the

distance between the lower rows of brushes different
from the distance between the upper rows.
