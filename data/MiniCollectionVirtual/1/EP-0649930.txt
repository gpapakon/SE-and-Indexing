<ABSTRACT>
To avoid a relatively high outlay in terms of construction and to improve accuracy in the determination of the laundry quantity, during the drum start-up phase (t0-t1) the drive torque (ML) on the drum drive motor is determined in order to operate the drum at a treatment speed (n1) at which the laundry is not held against the drum casing by centrifugal force. The invention can be used in washing machines and laundry driers and combinations of these.

Method of determining the laundry quantity in an at least approximately horizontally
mounted laundry drum, which is drivable by a universal motor at washing or drying

rotational speed, on the basis of observations of parameters of the operation in a laundry
treatment machine, characterised in that during the drum start-up phase (A) the drive

torque of the drum drive motor is determined for the operation of the drum at a regulated
handling rotational speed (n1) at which the laundry is not held against the drum

circumference by centrifugal force.
Method according to claim 1 with a phase lead control for the drive motor,
characterised in that during the drum start-up phase (A) the phase lead angle is

continuously recorded and its geometric mean value is formed, which is a measure for the
mean power of the drive motor, from which by way of the mass moment of inertia and the

load moment of the laundry batch its mass is calculated.
Method according to claim 1 or 2 in a washing machine with a device for
ascertaining the water quantity in the washing solution container, characterised in that an

item of information about the water quantity disposed in the washing solution container is
taken into consideration as a correction value in the calculation of the mass.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that values
about possible deviations of rotational speed from the target value of the rotational speed

increase are recorded and taken into consideration in the calculation of the mass.
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that the profile of the rotational
speed deviations is evaluated (periodic, singular, flat, abrupt, etc.) and in accordance with

the respective profile a stored attribute about the nature of the laundry batch is assigned
(large, medium, small, absorbent, less-absorbent laundry components, etc.).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a device for
determining the level of the operating voltage is provided and that the level of the

operating voltage is taken into consideration as a correction value in the calculation of the
mass. 
Method according to one of claims 1, 2 and 4 to 6 in a drum laundry drier,
characterised in that at the start and in the course of the drying process the drive torque of

the drum drive motor is determined a plurality of times and used for the calculation of the

mass of the respective laundry batch and that the differences each time of successive
calculation results serve as a measure for the determination of the instantaneous residual

moisture content of the laundry batch.
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that the determined residual
moisture content is a criterion for the conclusion of the drying process.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that during a
rotational speed holding phase (B) adjoining the drum start-up phase (A) the mean phase

lead angle of the rotational speed regulating equipment of the drum drive motor is
determined and serves as a measure for retarding moments, which are caused by the

machine, to be taken into consideration in the mass determination by means of the phase
lead angle of the start-up phase (A).
