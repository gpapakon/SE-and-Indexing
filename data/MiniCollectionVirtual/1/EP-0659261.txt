<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to temperature-controlled cabinets, particularly to refrigerators, freezers, fridge-freezers and drinks coolers (chillers). In order to reduce the emission of CFC's during injection and setting of foamed polyurethane, efforts have been made to use alternative polyurethane foams. A problem exists with these alternative foams in that the insulative properties thereof tend to be inferior to those of conventionally used foams leading to increased electrical power consumption. Seeking to address this problem, the present invention provides a cabinet within which a controllable stable temperature may be maintained, including an inner container (25a) and an outer shell (10a), a thermally insulating material (45a) being sandwiched therebetween, wherein at least a portion of a front (50a) of the outer shell (10a) comprises a panel (85a) which is displaced outwardly from the rest of the front (50a) of the outer shell (10a). In a preferred embodiment the cabinet forms a chest freezer (5a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to temperature-controlled 
cabinets, particularly refrigerators (fridges), freezers, 
fridge-freezers and drinks coolers (chillers). In freezers, for example, it is common to have an 
outer shell of sheet steel and an inner container of 
aluminium sheet, between which a layer of foamed 
polyurethane is injected. The polyurethane acts both as 
thermal insulation, and as a structural part, since it 
bonds to the outer shell and to the inner container. A known freezer is the 108 litre capacity "Ice 
Chef" (Trade Mark) chest freezer presently manufactured 
by the Applicant. In order to reduce the emission of CFC's during 
injection and setting of the foamed polyurethane, efforts 
have recently been made to use alternative polyurethane 
foams. For example, the blowing agent used in the 
polyurethane foam has been changed from R11 to pentene. A problem exists with these alternative foams, 
however, in that the insulative properties thereof tend 
to be inferior to those of conventionally used foams. 
This, therefore, means that refrigerators/freezers using 
the alternative foams tend to be less efficient, and 
consume more electrical power, in use. This deficiency 
in thermal insulation could be compensated for by 
increased thickness of the substitute foam. However, 
this leads to greater difficulties in other respects 
because of the need to accommodate the additional 
thickness of foam within the cabinet. Thus one is faced 
with a dilemma of either reduced internal load capacity 
or increased overall size of cabinet. Neither of these 
solutions would be attractive to a consumer. In the 
latter instance one must also take account of the need to 
accommodate such cabinets between standard sized units 
used in modern kitchen designs. From the point of view of the manufacturing industry 
alteration of the overall dimensions of the cabinet has  
 
even more serious implications due to increased material 
costs, re-design of tooling to handle and assemble the 
cabinets, not to mention also the need to re-design and 
produce a totally new packaging for the products using 
such larger cabinets. US 2 031 701 (Forsthoefel) discloses a refrigerator 
cabinet including an inner container, an outer shell 
(comprising end walls, a front wall and a rear wall, 
and a thermally insulating material sandwiched 
therebetween, the end walls being provided with an 
outwardly stamped panel which forms a reinforcing rib. 
US 2 031 701 does not, however, disclose a 
refrigerator cabinet employing a foamed

<CLAIMS>
A cabinet (5a-5f) within which a controllable 
stable temperature may be maintained, the cabinet 

including an inner container (25a), an outer shell (10a-10f) 
and a foamed thermally insulating material (45a) 

sandwiched therebetween, 
characterised in that
 at least 
one portion of the outer shell comprises a panel (85a-85f, 

75a-75f, 80a) which is displaced outwardly from the 

rest of the outer shell, each edge of the/each panel is 
spaced from each edge of the outer shell, and the foamed 

thermally insulating material fills a space formed 
between the inner container, outer shell and panel(s). 
A cabinet as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the inner container has four sides (50a-50f) of 

substantially rectangular shape and the outer shell (10a-10f) 
has a front and two sides (5a-5f, 6a) of 

substantially rectangular shape. 
A cabinet as claimed in claim 2, wherein at 
least a portion of the front comprises a panel (85a-85f) 

which is displaced outwardly from the rest of the front, 
and at least a portion of each side of the outer shell 

comprises respective further panels (75a-75f, 80a) which 
are displaced outwardly from the rest of the respective 

side. 
A cabinet as claimed in any of claims 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein the cabinet is adapted to be used as a 

refrigerator, freezer or drinks cooler by fitment of 
appropriate control equipment. 
A cabinet as claimed in any of claims 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein the cabinet is adapted to be used as an oven by 

fitment of appropriate control equipment. 
A cabinet as claimed in any preceding claim,  
 

wherein the cabinet is of a chest type. 
A cabinet as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
panels are substantially of the same shape as the 

front/sides of the cabinet, peripheral edges of the 
panels being located adjacent corresponding peripheral 

edges of the front/sides. 
A cabinet as claimed claim 3, wherein the 
panels are substantially parallel to the 

front/sides of the cabinet. 
A cabinet as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
panels are integrally connected to peripheral edges 

of the front/sides by a step (90a-90f, 95a, 100a-100f) 
which is of any suitable shape. 
A cabinet as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein graphic material(s) such as advertising matter 

is/are provided on the panel(s). 
A method of manufacturing a temperature 
controlled cabinet (5a-5f), comprising the steps of 

forming an outer shell (10a-10f), 
forming in at least one portion of the outer shell a 

panel (85a-85f) which is displaced outwardly from the 
rest of the outer shell, each edge of the/each panel being 

spaced from each edge of the outer shell, forming an 
inner container (25a), assembling the outer shell and 

inner container in relation to one another and filling a 
space formed between the inner container, outer shell and 

panel(s) with a foamed thermally insulating material
