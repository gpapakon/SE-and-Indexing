<ABSTRACT>
A fuel pumping apparatus of the rotary distributor type has a pumping plunger (14) mounted in a bore (13) in the distributor member and a cam ring (24) operable to move the plunger inwardly in timed relationship with the associated engine. The cam ring is positioned by a fluid pressure operable piston (25) contained within a cylinder (26). The apparatus includes a further piston (31) mounted in a further cylinder connected to the first mentioned cylinder, the further piston being biased by a pre-stressed spring (32). A stop is provided to limit the movement of the further piston against the action of the spring which yields to limit the fuel pressure developed by the plunger during the initial inward movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FUEL PUMPING APPARATUSThis invention relates to a fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a compression ignition engine and of the kind comprising a bore and a pumping plunger mounted in the bore, an outlet from the bore through which fuel can be displaced to an associated engine during inward movement of the plunger in the bore, cam means for imparting inward movement to the plunger, a drive shaft which is driven in synchronism with the engine and operable in conjunction with the cam means to impart inward movement to the plunger in timed relationship with the engine, fluid pressure operable means associated with the cam means for varying the commencement of inward movement of the plunger, and means for varying the quantity of fuel supplied by the apparatus to the associated engine.In a first example of such an apparatus the plunger or plungers is/are mounted in a transverse bore formed in a rotary distributor member which is mounted in a fixed body and which is coupled to the drive shaft so as to rotate therewith. The cam means comprises an annular cam ring which has cam lobes on its internal surface and these are engaged by followers associated with the plungers. The cam ring is angularly movable in the body or housing of the apparatus to vary the timing of fuel delivery and this is effected by a fluid pressure operable piston. The quantity of fuel supplied by the apparatus is determined by a valve means operable to spill fuel at a high rate from the bore. The valve may be a servo operated valve controlled either mechanically or electrically. The bore is completely filled with fuel during the filling period of the apparatus.In a second example of the apparatus the plunger 

or plungers is/are again mounted in. a transverse bore formed in a distributor member but the amount of fuel which is supplied to the associated engine is controlled by restricting the amount of fuel which is supplied to the bore using for example, an adjustable throttle member. The pumping plunger or plungers in this form of apparatus deliver fuel to the associated engine throughout their full inward movement in particular, while the associated cam followers move over the crests of the cam lobes.In a third example of the apparatus the plunger as well as being axially movable in the bore by the action of the cam means, is also coupled to the drive shaft so as to rotate therewith. The plunger is therefore able to act as a distributor element to ensure that fuel is delivered to a plurality of outlets in turn. A portion of the

CLAIMS
1. A f el pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a compression ignition engine comprising a bore (13) and a pumping plunger (14) mounted therein, an outlet (15) from the bore and through which fuel can be displaced to an associated engine during inward movement of the plunger in the bore, cam means (24) for imparting inward movement to the plunger in timed relationship with the associated engine, fluid pressure operable means including a piston (25) housed in a cylinder (26) associated with the cam means and operable to vary the commencement of inward movement of the plunger the pressure in said cylinder acting to oppose the movement of the piston by cam reaction forces, and means (21, 36) for varying the quantity of fuel supplied by the apparatus to the engine, characterised by a further piston (31) housed in a further cylinder (30) passage means connecting one end of said further cylinder (30) with said cylinder (26), a pre-stressed spring (32) urging the further piston towards said one end of the further cylinder, stop means (33) for limiting the movement of the further piston against the action of said spring, said further piston being subjected to the fluid pressure in said first mentioned cylinder (26) and yielding to limit the fuel pressure developed during the initial inward movement of the plunger.
2. An apparatus according to Claim 1 including passage means through which fluid can be supplied to said first mentioned cylinder (26) to adjust the setting of said cam means and a non-return valve (28) in said passage means to prevent escape of fluid under pressure from said cylinders (26, 30) during inward movement of the plunger by said cam means (24). 


3. An apparatus according to Claim 2 characterised by a relief valve (34) operable to limit the fluid pressure in said cylinders (26, 30) during inward movement of the plunger by said cam means (24).
4. A fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a compression ignition engine comprising a bore (13) and a pumping plunger (14) mounted therein, an outlet (15) from the bore and through which fuel can be displaced to an associated engine during inward movement of the plunger in the bore, cam means (24) for imparting inward movement to the plunger in timed relationship with the associated engine, fluid pressure operable means including a piston (25) housed in a cylinder (26) associated with the cam means and operable to vary the commencement of inward movement of the plunger the pressure in said cylinder acting to oppose the movement of the piston by cam reaction forces, and means (21, 36) for varying the quantity of fuel supplied by the apparatus to the engine, characterised by a relief valve (34) operable to limit the fluid pressure in said cylinder (26) during inward movement of the plunger by said cam means (24).
