Method of manufacturing surface-modified ceramic powders in the
nanometer size range and having an average particle size of not more than 100 nm,

characterized in that the unmodified powder having an average particle size of not
more than 100 nm is dispersed in water and/or an organic solvent in the presence of

at least one organic compound having a molecular weight of not more than 500 and
having at least one functional group capable of reacting and/or interacting with

groups present on the surface of said powder particles, and thereafter the
dispersant is optionally removed wholly or partly.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the ceramic powder
is selected from (mixed) metal oxides and carbides, nitrides, borides and

carbonitrides of metals and non-metals and mixtures thereof, and particularly
comprises boehmite.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that said organic
compound has a molecular weight of not more than 350.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that said organic
compound is selected from aliphatic, saturated or unsaturated C
1

12
 monocarboxylic
acids, amines of the formula R
3-n
NH
n
, wherein n = 0, 1 or 2, and the radicals R
independently represent alkyl groups having 1 to 12, particularly 1 to 6 carbon

atoms, β-dicarbonyl compounds having 4 to 12, particularly 5 to 8 carbon atoms,
modified alcoholates and organoalkoxysilanes.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the dispersion
medium comprises water and/or organic solvents.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 40 to 90, and
particularly 50 to 80% by weight of dispersion medium, based on the total weight of 

dispersion medium, ceramic powder and low molecular weight organic compound,
are employed.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the weight ratio
ceramic powder/organic compound ranges from 100:1 to 4:1, particularly from 50:1

to 8:1.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the dispersion
operation is carried out at a temperature of from 20°C to the boiling temperature of

the dispersion medium, preferably at from 50 to 100°C.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the dispersion
medium is removed by lyophilization.
Surface-modified ceramic powder and powder dispersion, respectively,
in the nanometer size range, obtainable according to the process of claim 1.
Method of manufacturing compositions for extrusion, characterized in
that powders and powder dispersions, respectively, according to claim 10 are

employed.
Method according to claim 11, characterized in that per 100 parts by
weight of the composition for extrusion 20 to 80, particularly 30 to 70 parts by weight

of surface-modified powder, 10 to 70, particularly 20 to 60 parts by weight of
dispersion medium and 0.5 to 20, particularly 2 to 15 parts by weight of additives

selected from binders, plastifiers and mixtures thereof are employed.
Method according to claim 11, characterized in that the surface-modified
powder is employed as such or in the form of a dispersion. 
Method according to claim 12, characterized in that the binders and
plastifiers are selected from modified celluloses, polyalkylene glycols,

dialkylphthalates and mixtures thereof.
Method according to claim 12, characterized in that the dispersion
medium is removed until a solids content of the composition for extrusion of at least

40% by volume is reached.
