<ABSTRACT>
A stopper (10) for sealing an open end (2) of a small internal 
diameter blood collection tube (5). 

The stopper includes a needle lead-in hole (20) that guides the 
needle through an upper portion (12) of 

the stopper to a penetration location at the bottom of the lead-in 
hole and to the open end of 

the small internal diameter tube. The stopper also includes a tube 
receiving chamber (18) in its 

lower portion (11) for receiving and sealing the open end of the tube. 
After the needle has 

penetrated the penetration location it passes through a resealable 
diaphragm (26) section before 

entering the open end of the tube. The lead-in hole and tube 
receiving chamber both have 

beveled edges (16,22) on their openings that aid in directing the needle 
and tube, respectively, into the stopper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stopper for a small diameter blood collection 
tube and, more particularly, relates to a stopper for a blood collection tube having an 
internal diameter that is no larger than about 0.250''. Blood collection tubes are commonly used by a doctor, phlebotomist or nurse to 
draw a sample of body fluid from a patient in a hospital or doctor's office for diagnostic 
testing. Generally the blood collection tube contains a vacuum that aids in drawing the 
body fluid from a puncture wound in the patient into the tube. For example, an 
evacuated blood collection tube is commonly used with a double-ended needle, wherein 
one end of the needle is inserted into the patient's arm and the other end is used to pierce 
through a stopper on the open end of the tube. When the needle enters the evacuated  
 
tube a predetermined amount of blood is drawn from the patient into the tube based upon 
the amount of vacuum in the tube. As vacuum in the tube increases, greater amounts of 
body fluid can be drawn into the tube. Because of the importance of retaining the 
predetermined amount of vacuum in the tube during shipping and storage of the tube, it 
is important that the stopper on the tube fits securely over the open end of the tube and 
maintains the vacuum in the tube. It is also important that the vacuum level is maintained in the tube to draw the 
desired volume of blood into the tube to limit any discomfort to the patient. Since the 
patient has one end of the needle in the skin during the drawing operation, the patient 
may experience pain during the operation which can be minimized by performing the 
operation as quickly as possible. If the vacuum in the tube is deficient, however, 
subsequent removal of the tube and insertion of another tube would be necessary which 
would prolong the unpleasant procedure. As those skilled in the field of blood collection are aware, the use of smaller 
diameter tubes for collecting small volumes of blood is becoming more desirable. In 
particular, tubes having an internal diameter of no greater than about 0.250'' are 
preferred for some types of blood collection. Therefore, there is an ever increasing 
need for a stopper for these small diameter tubes that is capable of maintaining a 
predetermined vacuum within the tube. In addition, because of the small diameter 
opening in these tubes there is a problem with directing the needle through the stopper 
and into the small opening in the tube. Currently, a special adapter must be mounted 
on top of

<CLAIMS>
A stopper for sealing an open end of a blood collection tube comprising: 
   an upper portion having means for directing a needle from a needle receiving area 

in said upper portion to an open end of a tube; and 
   a lower portion having a chamber for receiving the open end of the tube and 

means for sealing the open end of the tube. 
A stopper according to Claim 1 wherein said chamber is capable of receiving a 
tube having an internal diameter of about 0.250". 
A stopper according to Claim 1, further comprising a diaphragm between said 
needle receiving area in said upper portion and said sealing means in said lower portion, said 

diaphragm receiving the needle after the needle penetrates said needle receiving area and 
directing the needle along a path through said diaphragm into the open end of the tube. 
A stopper according to Claim 1, wherein said sealing means includes a cone-shaped 
seal within said chamber. 
A stopper according to Claim 1, wherein said sealing means includes an undercut 
for receiving a bead on the open end of the tube to securely seal the open end of the tube. 
A stopper according to Claim 1, wherein said upper portion further includes a 
trap surrounding said needle receiving area for capturing residue body fluid that may remain at 

said needle receiving area when the needle is withdrawn from said stopper. 
A stopper according to Claim 6, wherein said upper portion further includes a rim 
surrounding said trap to prevent said needle receiving area from being contaminated through 

 
accidental contact prior to the needle penetration and prevent the residue body fluid from 

flowing out of said stopper after needle penetration. 
A stopper according to Claim 1, wherein an opening to said chamber is 
surrounded by a beveled edge that directs the open end of the tube into said chamber. 
A stopper according to Claim 1, wherein said means for directing the needle from 
said needle receiving area in said upper portion into the open end of the tube includes a lead-in 

hole having an opening with a beveled edge which prevents the needle from being obstructed 
during its movement through said lead-in hole and helps direct the needle to the open end of 

the tube. 
A stopper according to Claim 1, further comprising an outer wall having an edge 
where said upper portion and said lower portion meet, said outer wall expanding in diameter as 

it approaches said edge.
