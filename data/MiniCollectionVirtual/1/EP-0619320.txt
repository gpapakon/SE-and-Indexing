<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
derivatives of an antibiotic erythromycin. More 
particularly, it relates to novel derivatives of 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives and pharmaceutically 
acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Erythromycin is an antibiotic clinically 
widely used as an agent for curing infectious diseases 
caused by Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative 
bacteria, mycoplasmas, etc. Many derivatives of 
erythromycin have been produced for improving the 
biological and/or pharmacodynamic characteristics of 
erythromycin. So, for example, EP-A-0 216 169 describes antibacterially 
active 6-carbamate erythromycin derivatives, 
JP-A-60-231691 discloses erythromycin derivatives with 
the oxime nitrogen incorporated into the 14-membered 
ring, JP-A-1-96190 (English language abstract) details 
antibacterial erythromycin 11,12-cyclic carbonates, and 
EP-A-0 248 279 describes antibacterial erythromycin 
11,12-cyclic carbamates. As 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives, 3-O-acyl-5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives, for example, have been disclosed in U.S. 
Patent 3,923,784. 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives, however, have been generally considered to 
be poor in antibacterial activity, and the antibacterial 
activity of the above-exemplified derivatives is also 
very weak. An object of the present invention is to 
provide novel antibiotics having a strong antibacterial 
activity.  
 The present inventors conducted various 
researches on the antibacterial activity of 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives and consequently 
found that compounds obtained by introducing a certain 
substituted carbonyloxy group into 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
derivatives at the 3-position have a very 
strong antibacterial activity unexpectedly, whereby the 
present invention has been accomplished. The present invention provides a 
5-O-desosaminylerythronolide derivative 
represented by the formula: 
 
[wherein Y is a group represented by the formula: 
 
(wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a 
halogen atom, a C1-C3 alkyl group or an amino group, and 
n is an integer of 0 to 4), an oxygen atom, a vinylene 
group, or a group represented by the formula -CH2-NH-CO-,  
 
R is a C7-C15 aralkyl group; a C7-C15 aralkyl group 
containing at least one nitrogen atom, oxygen atom or 
sulfur atom; a phenyl group; a substituted phenyl group 
having 1 to 5 substituents selected from halogen atoms, 
nitro groups, amino groups, C1-C3 alkyl groups,
