<ABSTRACT>
A device for providing electric power from a signal transmitter (2) with at least two signal outputs for a load (3) which requires the application of voltage of both polarities as simultaneously as possible. Here, the signal outputs (Sl to Sn) to be used for power supplies are allocated via rectifier components, especially diodes (12) to a first output (6) of a first polarity and a second output (7) of a second polarity. They are switched via a switching component (8) which is controlled by the signal outputs (Sl to Sn) concerned. In addition, the load (3) is connected via a series-mounted voltage converter (9).

<CLAIMS>
Device for supplying voltage from a signal 
transmitter (2) having at least two signal outputs for 

a load (3) which requires the application of voltage of 
two different polarities as simultaneously as possible, 

for which purpose the signal outputs (from S1 to Sn), 
which are to be brought into use for the voltage 

supply, are allocated by way of rectifier elements, in 
particular diodes (12), to a first output (6) of the 

first polarity and to a second output (7) of the second 
polarity, characterised in that the outputs (6, 7) are 

connected to the load (3) by way of a switching element 
(8), which is controlled by the signal outputs (from S1 

to Sn) which are to be taken into account, and by way 
of a voltage converter (9), which is arranged 

electrically in series therewith, with the switching 
element (8) interrupting at least the line which 

carries the non-convertible potential. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the control input of the switching element (8) is 

connected separately to the signal outputs (from S1 to 
Sn) which are to be taken into account for the control 

process, if appropriate - for instance in the case of 
alternating signals - by way of rectifier elements, in 

particular diodes (12), and in that the throughput 
input of the switching element (8) is connected to the 

signal outputs (from S1 to Sn) which are to be brought 
into use for the voltage supply of the load, if 

appropriate - for instance in the case of alternating 
signals - by way of rectifier elements, in particular 

diodes (12). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that an earth line (4) is led through 

between signal transmitter (2) and load (3), connected 
between which earth line and each of the terminals for 

the converter (9) there is an energy store, in  
 

particular a capacitor (10, 11).
