<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new and original 
water-paint, in liquid form: a milky emulsion 
(pasteurized whole milk or powdered milk diluted in 
water) containing low amount of water and comprising 
minerals, acetic acid solutions and other components. 
Said water-paint, more than other similar products on 
the market, having bactericidal, fireproof, 
transpiring, ecologic, isolating, desalting properties 
is suitable for manifactured building articles, wood, 
metals and plastics. Coatings is, in general, the field 
of application of the present invention. A normal varnish is usually a solution and/or a 
suspension of variable consistency, with or without 
coloring pigments, characterized by the fact that upon 
application on whichever object it forms, on drying, a 
tough, resistant film with protective properties. The 
varnish consists of a liquid vehicle in which coloring 
components, in case of a colored paint, and various 
additives are suspended. The liquid vehicle once 
composed of oils, is nowadays composed of synthetic 
resins obtained through polymerization or 
polycondensation. Solvents or thinners (alcohol, 
esters, etc.) are the binding elements. Peculiar  
 
characteristics are given to the paint by substances 
called additives among which driers, suspending 
elements, plasticizers etc. are to be mentioned. In 
particular, the group of plasticizers, as an integral 
part of the film, improves elasticity and flexibility. The present invention is characterized by its new 
original composition whose advantages are not easily 
found in common coatings. The fundamental principle of 
the present invention is that the milk (whole 
pasteurized milk or powdered milk) allows to amalgamate 
in a solution with a low amount of water the following 
elements: 
a) minerals as calcium sulfate also in form of powdered 
stucco; litophone or a mixture of barium sulfate and zinc sulphide; 
silicon oxide; calcium oxide; calcium 
carbonate; calcium hydroxide; cement; talc and all 
alkaline - earth minerals; b) aqueous solution of acetic acid obtained with wine, 
beer, cider and other slightly alcoholic liquids 
through distillation and synthesis processes with a 
percentage of 6 to 15% acetic acid; c) wood (wood shavings); d) polyacrylic and polyurethan products; e) polysaccharides having either a mechanical function 
(cellulose, chitin) or a thickening function (wheat 
flour, oatmeal, corn meal, bonemeal, fishmeal, beet 
sugar and cane sugar, fructose, saccharose and 
dextrose);  
 f) drying oils like
