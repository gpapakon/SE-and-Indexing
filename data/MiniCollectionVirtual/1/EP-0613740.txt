<ABSTRACT>
Process for the pressing of metal sheets which provides for 
the use of a hydraulic press whose blank holder is controlled 

so as to exert on the sheet in the pressing phase a 
restraining pressure which is alternately variable, with a 

pre-determined frequency, between zero and a pre-determined 
maximum, the value of the maximum pressure and the frequency 

depending on the properties of the sheet to be pressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a process for the pressing of metal 
sheets 
according to the preamble of claim 1, 
particularly the deep drawing (drawing) of motor 
vehicle body components. The invention also concerns a hydraulic press 
according to the preamble of claim 5, 
capable of 
implementing the above-mentioned pressing process. In known pressing processes a sheet is installed between a 
matrix and a punch of the die, clamped with pre-determined 
force by a blank holder which has the task of restraining the 
sheet against the matrix in the course of the plastic 
deformation operation. The value of the clamping pressure 
exerted by the blank holder against the sheet in the pressing 
phase is fixed and is determined by trials working initially 
on a batch of test sheets, to be then kept constant for the 
entire production phase. This method of working at "constant pressure" has a number of 
disadvantages particularly in the case of dies of complex 
shape and for deep drawing, which generally result in a 
relatively high percentage of rejects due to the formation of 
flaws on the sheet or the rupture of the sheet itself. To overcome these disadvantages EP patent application No. 
0348774 by this Applicant proposes using a hydraulic press 
in which the blank holder is actuated with a clamping pressure 
that is pulsating or alternately variable with a pre-determined 
law between a minimum value and a maximum value. 
However, not even this system has proved to be totally 
effective in reducing rejects in the pressing of certain 
particularly complex components or pressing sheets which are 
made of aluminium or have properties that are different from 
those of steel sheet. Consequently some steel sheet body 
components have to be produced with special, very expensive 
so-called "back-hardening" sheets with a high work-hardening 
capability; and, however, it is not yet possible to produce 
vehicles with bodies entirely of aluminium on an industrial 
scale at acceptable cost unless they are restricted to body  
 
shapes that are extremely simple and unacceptable from the 
style point of view. The object of the invention is to provide an improved process 
of the pulsating pressure type disclosed above which enables 
the disadvantages of the latter to be overcome in a simple and 
economic manner thus enabling sheets, including aluminium 
sheets, to be processed in complex shapes at low cost. This object is achieved according to the invention by a process 
for the pressing of metal sheets as claimed in claim 1. In

<CLAIMS>
Process for the pressing of metal sheets (2) comprising the steps of: 

arranging a sheet (2) between a matrix (4) and a punch (5) of a die which are 
shaped in the shape of a component to be obtained; and 
deforming the sheet (2) by means of the said matrix (4) and punch (5), restraining the 
sheet (2) between these latter exerting on the sheet (2), by means of a blank holder (6), 

a pulsating pressure alternately variable between a minimum value and a 
maximum value, the said pulsating pressure having a pre-determined frequency;
characterized
 in that said minimum value is equal to zero, said pre-determined 
frequency being selected according to the mechanical properties of 

the sheet (2) to be pressed and in such a manner to achieve, in the 
course of the active stroke of the punch (5), at least one pressure variation cycle 

from zero to the maximum value for every 8-10 mm of depth of drawing of the 
sheet (2). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the frequency of the 
said pulsating pressure is between zero and 20 Hz inclusive and is selected at a 

value that is higher, the lower the hardness of the sheet (2) used. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the frequency of 
the said pulsating pressure is caused to vary in the course of the pressing 

operation. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that a 
blank holder (6) is used, sub-divided into a multiplicity of restraining elements 

(10) which are independent of each other, by means of each of which a pulsating  
 

pressure variable with a different law from element to element, between 
zero and a maximum value, which may differ from element to element, is 

exerted on the sheet (2) in the pressing phase. 
Hydraulic press (1) for the pressing of sheets (2), for actuating the process 
according to anyone of the foregoing Claims, comprising at last one blank 

holder (6) controlled by actuators (20) via a hydraulic control circuit comprising 
valve means (22) for alternately pressurizing/depressurizing the actuators (20) of the 

blank holder (6), wherein said valve means (22) are capable of causing the pressure 
exerted by the blank holder (6) on the sheet (2) to vary between a pre-determined 

maximum value and a minimum value equal to zero; the said valve means (22) 
comprising timing means (23) for selectively varying on a continuous basis the 

alternate pressurizing/depressurizing frequency of the said actuators (20);
characterized
 in that the blank holder (6) is sub-divided into a multiplicity of 
restraining elements (10) independent of each other, each provided with at least 

one independent actuator (20) of its own controlled by the said valve means (22), in 
order to be able to be pressurized/depressurized with a law different from that 

of the other actuators (20); said actuators being operated by said valve means 
(22) and said timing means (23) in such a manner to achieve, in the course o
f 
the activity stroke of the punch (5), at least one pressure variation cycle from 

zero to the maximum value for every 8-10 mm of depth of drawing of the sheet 
(2).
