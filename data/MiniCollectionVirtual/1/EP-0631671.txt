<DESCRIPTION>
 FIBER OPTIC ATTENUATORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present relates generally to fiber optics, and more specifically to a method for making an attenuator. Although a primary virtue of optical fibers as a communication medium is the low loss of the fibers, there are instances where it is necessary to provide attenuation in the path. U.S. Patent No. 4,557,556 and 4,557,557 disclose metho of fabricating attenuator for optical fibers by fusion splicing. In the '556 patent, a fiber is cleaved, and the ax of the cleaved ends are offset and butted one another. The abutted offset ends of the fibers are melted and the axes of the cores of the melted abutted fiber ends are aligned by way of surface tension. This realigns the cores, except that the cleaved ends of the cores bend off the axis in opposite directions. The technique is said to be applicable to single mode optical fibers, which are characterized by a core diamet of 8-10 microns and a cladding diameter of 125 microns. In the '557 patent, the cleaved fiber ends are aligned and melted, and while the ends are in a plastic state, they are moved towards each other to distort the fiber ends. The cores bend slightly near their abutted ends and are partially or wholly misaligned to provide the attenuation. During fabrication, light is injected into one of the fibers and a receiver is coupled to the other fiber. Initial axial alignment prior to fusing is performed by maximizing the transmission through the abutting fibers. When the fibers ar fused, the power level is monitored and movement is stopped when a desired level of optical loss is observed.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for fabricating a fiber optic attenuator that is applicable to bo single-mode and multi-mode fibers. The attenuators may be fabricated to provide any desired level of attenuation in a 

wide range of levels and are characterized by a high level of wavelength insensitivity.In brief, the present invention contemplates bringing the ends of a pair of fiber segments into a relative position where the radially outer surfaces of the fiber ends are in contact with each other and overlap by an axial distance that is greater than the fiber diameter. The overlapping fiber ends are heated so that they assume a plastic state, and the relative axial positioning of the fiber ends is adjusted while they are in the plastic state to achieve a degree of attenuation.Monitoring the attenuation during fabrication is performed as follows. A light source is connected to one
