<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for producing a diamond-like 
carbon coating. The method comprises the steps of providing a substrate to be 

coated, providing a cathode of vitreous carbon or a pyrolytic graphite cathode 
and initiating a cathodic arc discharge with the arc spot on the cathode surface 

and directing the resulting carbon plasma toward the substrate to form a coating 
on said substrate, said coating being substantially macroparticle free.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing diamond-like
coatings and the coated articles made thereby.Amorphous carbon films having diamond-like properties of extreme
hardness, extremely low electrical conductivity, low coefficients of friction, and
optical transparency over a wide range of wavelengths, have widespread
applications as optical coatings, low friction, anti-corrosion coatings and wear-resistant
coatings and in various other applications such as surface finishing and
in semiconductor manufacturing.Diamond-like carbon is a non-crystalline, or amorphous, material
having two types of carbon-carbon bonds, i.e., hexagonal graphite bonds (sp2)
and tetrahedral diamond bonds (sp3). Thus, diamond-like carbon has both
limited long range order and two types of short range order.Diamond-like carbon may be hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated.
Hydrogenated diamond-like carbon is produced from a hydrocarbon gas mixture
using various energy sources, e.g., DC discharge, microwave and RF energy,
oxyacetylene torches, and hot filaments. Non-hydrogenated diamond-like
coatings can be produced using magnetron sputtering, electron beam
evaporation, laser ablation and mass filtered carbon-ion beam deposition
techniques, each of which has a very low deposition rate. Each method for
producing the non-hydrogenated diamond-like carbon produces a hard carbon
coating but the coatings have differing sp3/sp2 bond ratios and, thus, the
structural and physical characteristics differ.The sp3/sp2 bond ratio can be estimated from the plasmon energy
determined by electron energy loss spectroscopy. The plasmon energy is
proportional to the atom density and diamond has a greater atom density and
plasmon energy than graphite. Polycrystalline graphite has a plasmon energy
loss of about 25 electron volts (eV). Diamond has a plasmon energy loss of
about 33 eV. Non-hydrogenated diamond-like carbon has a plasmon energy
loss between about 26 and 32 eV, the higher plasmon energies corresponding to
higher atom densities which are believed to be due to an increased sp3 bonding
component. Hydrogen-free non-crystalline diamond-like carbon coatings can also
be produced using cathodic arc plasma deposition, a process which provides
high deposition rates and allows control over the incident ion kinetic energy and
the substrate temperatures. The sp3/sp2 bond ratio is believed to be dependent
on the incident ion kinetic energy. Cathodic arc plasma deposition can produce
diamond-like carbon coatings with higher plasmon energies than
