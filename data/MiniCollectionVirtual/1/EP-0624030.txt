<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement for controlling the amplitude of an audio IF signal from a television signal which also comprises a video signal, by means of a device by means of which the controlling is effected with a first control time constant, is described. To bring the picture and sound reproduction into a stable state with equal rapidity after a channel change in such a circuit arrangement without impairing the transmission quality of the audio signal, the device is constructed to be switchable in such a manner that the controlling is effected with a second control time constant when the level of the picture signal assumes a value within a predetermined value range.

<CLAIMS>
A circuit arrangement for controlling the amplitude of an intermediate-frequency
carrier oscillation modulated with a sound signal (IF sound signal) of a

television signal further comprising a picture signal by means of a device with which
the control with a first control time constant is realised, and is adapted to be reversible

in such a way that the control is realized with a second time constant when the level of
the picture signal assumes a value in a predetermined range of values, and in which the

second control time constant has a smaller value than the first, 
characterized in that
 the
predetermined range of values of the picture signal in which this second control time

constant is operative is at lower values as compared with the nominal value of the
picture signal level, in that the device by which the control with one of the control time

constants is realised comprises a storage means for storing a setting signal for a device
for setting the amplitude of the IF sound signal, and at least a storage reversal device by

which the storage means can be reversed in conformity with one of the control time
constants, and in that the storage means comprises a capacitance and the storage

reversal device comprises at least a reversible current source.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
device, by which the control with the first or the second control time constant is

realised, is reversible to at least one further control time constant.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that
 at least
the first or the second control time constant is operative when the television signal is

formed in accordance with a first transmission standard, and in that at least one of the
further time constants is operative when the television signal is formed in accordance

with another transmission standard.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 2 or 3, 
characterized by
 a
detection device which detects the instant when a threshold value is exceeded by the 

amplitude of the IF sound signal and by which the device is reversible in such a way
that the control is realised with another one of the further control time constants.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the storage means is adapted to store digital setting signals and the
storage reversal device comprises a circuit by which the value of a setting signal stored

in the storage means is variable in steps which are determined by the selected control
tune constant.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the black level of the picture signal is used as the level evaluated
for selecting the control time constant.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
, for reversing the storage means at least with the first control time
constant, the current of at least one of the current sources is multiplied by a multiplier

signal derived from the demodulated IF sound signal in a multiplier stage for forming a
reversing current which is applied to the storage means.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized by
an arrangement for demodulating the IF sound signal and for supplying a direct
voltage corresponding to the amplitude of the intermediate-frequency carrier

oscillation, and possibly a low-frequency sound signal,
an arrangement for converting the direct voltage and possibly the low-frequency
sound signal into a direct current and possibly into a sound signal current,
a current source for superimposing a working point current on the direct current
and possibly on the sound signal current,
a series arrangement constituted by a resistor and a reference voltage source
which can receive the superimposed currents,
and an amplifier arrangement for amplifying a voltage produced at the resistor.
A circuit arrangement as claimed in claim 8 where appendant to claim 7,

characterized in that
 the amplifier arrangement supplies the multiplier signal.
