<ABSTRACT>
The device for exchanging cutting tools comprises a moving carriage which includes a base (15) located below the floor of a podium (6), this base (15) being equipped with running and guiding means (16 to 25) to allow it to move, perpendicularly to the face of the cutting station, in a slot (29) formed in the floor of the podium (6). The base (15) is equipped at its top with a support frame (31) consisting of a base plate (30) equipped with a sliding bearing (34) through which there passes a supporting spindle (27) fixed to the base (15) and with two substantially vertical uprights (32, 33) joined together at one of their ends and arranged on the base plate (30) so as to form an isoceles triangle. The support frame (31) is provided with lifting means (43) attached to the apex of the isoceles triangle formed by the base plate (30) and by the uprights (32, 33) and bears on a pivot (42) arranged at one of the ends of the support spindle (27) in order to bring about the upward and downward vertical movement of the support frame (31). The base plate (30) includes housings for supporting cutting tools and means for retaining the tools arranged in the vicinity of the upper part of the isoceles triangle of the support frame (31).

Method for exchanging cutting tools (12, 13) in a platen press 
(1) by means of a movable carriage (11), method consisting in putting a 

part of a first replacement cutting tool (13) and a second replacement 
cutting tool (12) on the first almost vertical face of a supporting frame (31) 

of the movable carriage (11) when the latter is in its off-position, in 
extracting from the cutting section (3) of the platen press (1) a first cutting 

tool which has to be replaced in order to bring the tool on arms (9, 10) 
which are arranged at the level of the said cutting section (3), in bringing 

the carriage (11) close to the arms (9, 10) of the cutting section (3), in 
removing from the supporting frame a part of this tool and in laying it on the 

carriage (11), against a second almost vertical face of the supporting frame 
(31), in removing from the first face of the supporting frame (31) the part of 

the first replacement cutting tool (13) and in laying and fixing this part of the 
first replacement cutting tool (13) on its supporting frame and in inserting 

and locking the said tool (13) in the cutting section (3) of the platen press 
(1), in extracting from the cutting section (3) of the platen press (1) the 

second cutting tool (12) which has to be replaced, in order to bring it on the 
arms (9, 10) arranged at the level of the said cutting section (3), in having 

the said cutting tool pivot with an angle of 90° in a horizontal plane, in 
bringing the first face of the supporting frame (31) of the carriage (11) into 

contact with the tool which has been pivoted, in raising this tool in order to 
release it from its pivots so as to have it supported by the supporting frame 

(31) of the carriage (11), in taking away the carriage (11) from the arms (9, 
10) of the cutting section (3), in having the supporting frame (31) of the 

carriage (11) pivot on a vertical plane with an angle of 180° so that its 
second face carrying the second replacement cutting tool (12) will face the 

arms of the cutting section (3), in bringing this tool (12) close to its pivots, in 
lowering the tool (12) on its pivots in order to release it from the supporting 

frame (31) of the carriage (11) before the latter is set back to its off-position 
and in having the tool (12) pivot of 90° in a horizontal plae on the pivots of  

 
the arms (9, 10) in order to insert it after in the cutting section (3) where it 

will be locked. 
Device for setting into operation the method according to 
claim 1, including a movable carriage (11) with a base (15) arranged 

underneath the floor of the platform (6), this base (15) being provided with 
rolling and guiding means (16 to 25) so as to be able to move almost 

perpendicularly to the face of the cutting section (3) in a slot (29) arranged 
through the floor of the platform (6), characterized by the fact that the base 

(15) is equipped at its upper part with a supporting frame (31) made of a 
basic plate (30) provided with a sliding bearing (34) that is crossed by a 

supporting axle (27) which is fitted on the base (15) and with two almost 
vertical standards (32, 33) linked at one of their ends and arranged on the 

basic plate (30) in order to make up an isosceles triangle, the said 
supporting frame (31) being provided with hosting means (43) attached to 

the top of the isosceles triangle which is made up of the basic plate (30) 
and the standards (32, 33) and being supported by a pivot arranged at the 

upper end of the supporting axle (27) in order to cause the vertical ascent 
and descent of the supporting frame (31), the supporting frame (31) being 

able to pivot around the supporting axle (27), by the fact that the basic plate 
(30) comprises seats (35, 36) for supporting the cutting tools (12, 13) and 

by the fact that the means for retaining the cutting tools (12, 13) are 
arranged close to the upper part of the isosceles triangle of the supporting 

frame (31). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the rolling means of the movable carriage (11) include rollers (16, 17) fitted 

on the base (15) of the carriage (11) and sliding on a rail (18) arranged on 
the ground underneath the platform (6), and by the fact that the guiding 

means of the carriage (11) consist of rollers (20, 21) arranged on either 
side of the upper part of the base (15), these rollers sliding in a groove 

which consists of two iron corner braces (24, 25) fitted against the lower 
face of the platform (6).

the hosting means (43) of the supporting frame (31) of the carriage (11) 

consist of a device with folded arms actuated by a crosswise control screw 

(48). 
Device according to claim 4, characterized by the fact that 
the hosting means (43) of the supporting frame (31) of the carriage (11) 

consist of a jack whose body is fitted, so as to be able to pivot, on the 
supporting axle (27) of the base (15) of the carriage (11) and whose rod is 

fitted on the top of the isosceles triangle made up of the standards (32, 33) 
and the basic plate (30) of the supporting frame (31) of the carriage (11). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the pivot arranged at the end of the supporting axle (27) of the base (15) of 

the carriage (11) consist of a thrust ball bearing (39) of which one ring (41)

other ring (40) is fitted on the upper end of the supporting axle (27). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the means retaining the cutting tools (12, 13) consist of pivoting hooks (53,
