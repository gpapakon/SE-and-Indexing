<ABSTRACT>
In an electronic blood pressure measuring instrument constructed so as to take out a pulse wave from a 
measured cuff pressure, a pulse wave pattern is generated from the data on the pulse wave ampliture and pulse wave 

interval, and this pulse wave pattern is compared with a reference pattern so as to classify the pattern, whereby the 
information on organisms other than blood pressure values is reliably obtained. A pulse wave amplitude PA (i) is 

calculated on the basis of a measured cuff pressure C (i), and a pulse wave pattern is generated (35) on the basis of the 
data on the pulse wave amplitude, this pulse wave pattern being classified (37) into a plurality of reference patterns 

in accordance with a reference pattern or a reference value (36). The reference pattern or reference value referred to 
above are set as a dynamic reference of circulcation of blood based on the dynamic characteristics of blood vessel 

or the pulsation characteristics of heart. The pulse wave pattern is normalized as necessary, whereby shape elements 

only of the pattern are extracted, which are displayed as a measured pattern corresponding to the reference pattern, 
the shape of the measured pattern and that of the reference pattern being compared with each other. Besides the 

shape elements, the absolute value of pulse wave amplitude and a maximum blood pressure value are used as pattern 
classification references.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic blood
pressure measurement device which detects the cuff
pressure for the evaluation of vascular dynamics and is
concerned in particular with an improved device for
obtaining biological information besides blood pressure,
etc. on the basis of pulse wave components extracted from
the cuff pressure.Conventional devices for non-invasive measurement of
vascular dynamics include that which detects the
Korotkoff's sound that is generated by the pulse waves
within the blood vessels during the process of gradually
decreasing the pressure of a pressurized cuff. In such a
device, the pressures at the points in time at which the
Korotkoff's sound is generated, becomes the maximum and
disappears are detected to obtain the systolic blood
pressure, the mean blood pressure and the diastolic blood
pressure. However, detection errors occur easily in this 
method since the Korotkoff's sound is a minute sound in a
frequency band that is easily influenced by external noise
and this method has such problems as large detection
errors and poor reproducibility since the decay of sound
waves differ greatly according to the detected part and
the thickness of the superficial tissue.Thus, in recent years, the oscillometric method has
come to be used in which the blood pressure, etc. are
directly computed from the variations in the cuff
pressure. In this method, the pulse waves that are
overlaid onto the detected cuff pressure are extracted to
derive the amplitudes of the pulse waves and the pressures
at the points at which the pulse wave amplitude is the
maximum, at which the amplitude is a predetermined
proportion of the maximum value at the higher pressure
side of the maximum and at which the amplitude is a
predetermined proportion of the maximum pressure at the
lower pressure side of the maximum are determined as the
mean blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and diastolic
blood pressure, respectively. Sphygmomanometers that use
this method are not easily affected by external influences
such as external noise and vibration and enable
measurements of high accuracy and reproducibility since 
highly sensitive pressure sensors can be used and since
the detected signals are in a low frequency band.Most of the measurement devices of the said type
perform only the detection of the systolic pressure, the
diastolic pressure, the mean blood pressure and the pulse
rate. However, since these values are influenced by
various factors such as cardiac output and degree of
hardening of the
