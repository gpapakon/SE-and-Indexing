<ABSTRACT>
By means of the method, it is possible to determine the overrun force exerted by a trailer on a tractor vehicle during braking without the need for a force sensor at the coupling, thereby making it possible to achieve a corresponding cost saving in the control of the overrun force. This method consists essentially in that the equilibrium of forces of the forces acting on the tractor vehicle in the vertical direction is determined, the equilibrium of forces of the forces acting on the tractor vehicle in the horizontal direction is determined and that, finally, the overrun force is determined from the vertical and horizontal equilibrium of forces.
