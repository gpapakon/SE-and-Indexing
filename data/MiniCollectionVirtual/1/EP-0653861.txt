<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for sampling clock signal recovery in a modem comprising an input buffer memory (10) holding as many converter digital output values as there are samples in a baud; a receiving filter (12); a phase loop for controlling the oscillator as a function of the phase of the input signal (TSIG) detected by a sampling filter (31); means (31) arranged at the input of the phase loop, in order to determine whether the shift between the received phase and the phase sought lies within one or the other of several frequency ranges; means (32) for adding to the shift value a constant corresponding to the defined range of frequencies; means (30) arranged at the input of the receiving circuit, for shifting the order of analysis of the data held in the input buffer memory (10) depending on the abovementioned offset.
