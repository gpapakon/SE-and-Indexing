<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color ink
jet recording method and apparatus capable of
recording color images with sharpness and high
density, more particularly to color ink jet recording
method and apparatus using color inks such as yellow,
magenta, cyan or the like inks and black ink.The present invention is applicable to an
apparatus for a recording material such as paper,
cloth, unwoven material, OHP sheet or the like, more
particularly to a printer, copying machine, facsimile
machine and another office equipment or mass-production
equipment or the like.An ink jet recording method is used for a
printer, copying machine, facsimile machine or the
like because of the low noise, low running cost, small
size and easiness for the color printing.When an ink jet recording method is used for
a color recording apparatus, a special sheet having an
absorbing layer is used to provide high quality color
images with clear color and without ink mixture.
Recently, the ink has been improved to permit use of
plain paper. However, the print quality on the plain
paper is not satisfactory. One of the most important
problems is the satisfaction of both of the prevention 
of the mixture between different color inks and
accomplishment of black recording (black characters).Usually, when a color image is to be recorded
on plain paper through ink jet recording method,
quick-drying ink having high penetration speed is
used. By doing so, the color image portion is of high
quality without the ink mixture. However, the black
image has low density with so-called feathering (ink
expansion along fibers of paper).When the black image is printed on a color
background, the problem with the black image is less
remarkable, and therefore, the print quality is not
remarkably deteriorated. However, the black image
exists independently of the color image, the print
quality is degraded. When the black image is
characters, the insufficient sharpness results in poor
image quality.In order to provide high quality image with
high density in the black image without feathering, it
is desired that a relatively large number of shots of
the ink having a relatively low penetration speed for
the plain paper. However, in this case, the color
mixture between the black ink and the color ink occurs
at the boundary between the black image and the color
image with the result of remarkable image quality
deterioration.The problem of the ink mixture can be 
improved to a certain degree by using a so-called fine
mode in which the image is formed by a plurality
