<ABSTRACT>
An optical modulation device includes first (1, 4, 6) and second (2, 5, 7) optically transmissive parallel plates having a ferroelectric liquid crystal material sandwiched between them. A plurality of spacer members (10), each secured to one of the plates, are located between the plates to maintain the plate spacing. The spacer members form walls defining parallel liquid crystal material-containing channels (11) which extend parallel to the plates. These channels communicate along their lengths with cavities (12) at least partly defined by the spacer members (10). These cavities may be created by segmenting each wall, the separations between the successive segments constituting the respective cavities. Alternatively, each wall (14) may be provided with a parallel auxiliary wall (10) of lesser height close to it but spaced from it, the space between the two walls forming a cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical modulation device
including first and second optically transmissive parallel
plates having a ferroelectric liquid crystal material
sandwiched therebetween, a plurality of spacer members,
each secured to a said plate, being located between said
plates for maintaining spacing between said plates at a
predetermined value, said spacer members defining
substantially parallel liquid crystal material-containing
channels extending parallel to the plates.A device of the above general kind is known, for
example, from GB-B-2157451 and US-A-4763995. In such
devices the facing surfaces of the two plates are normally
provided with respective arrays of optically transmissive
electrodes, for example, mutually orthogonal grids of
electrodes, by means of which portions of the liquid
crystal material can be selectively addressed. Such
addressing enables optical properties of selected portions
of the material to be changed. If the assembly of the two
plates is positioned between crossed polarisers, the said
addressing can result in modification of the optical
transmissivity of selected areas of the resulting device,
thereby enabling it to be used, for example, as a
television display device.In the device known from the above-identified patents,
the spacer members take the form of parallel solid walls
all of which are secured to one plate and extend from one
side of the plate to the other. According to the
disclosure of GB-B-2157451 the walls of the device
disclosed therein serve the additional purpose of improving
monodomain formability in the liquid crystal material, and
to this end they are oriented parallel with or
perpendicular to a monaxial orientation treatment
(conventionally a rubbing treatment) which has been applied
to the face of at least one of the two plates contacting
the liquid crystal material.Devices of the general kind specified in the first 
paragraph can be subjected to substantial temperature
variations. This can give rise to problems in some cases
if spacer members of the kind disclosed in the above-identified
patents are employed. In particular differences
in the thermal expansion coefficients of the materials of
the spacer members and the plate to which they are secured
may give rise to disruption of the structural integrity of
the device.Devices of the general kind specified in the first
paragraph can, moreover, be subjected to mechanical
deformation forces which cause parts of the liquid crystal
material to move relative to other parts thereof. If the

<CLAIMS>
An optical modulation device including first (1) and
second (2) optically transmissive parallel plates which face

and are spaced from each other, ferroelectric liquid crystal
material (3) sandwiched between said plates, and a plurality

of spacer members (10), each secured to a said plate,
located between said plates for maintaining the spacing

between the plates at a predetermined value, said spacer
members being arranged to form elongate barriers (13) to

flow of liquid crystal material, which barriers extend
parallel to each other and to the plates, characterized in

that the barriers are segmented with each segment consisting
of one said spacer member, and the spaces (12) between the

spacer members forming the successive segments of each
barrier are sufficiently small that liquid crystal material

voids are present within them.
A device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the members of a
first subset of a respective set of spacer members (10)

forming the segments of each barrier are secured to the
first plate (1) and the members of a second subset of said

set are secured to the second plate (2) so that the two
subsets form an interdigitated structure.
An optical modulation device including first (1) and
second (2) optically transmissive parallel plates which face

and are spaced from each other, ferroelectric liquid crystal
material (3) sandwiched between said plates, and a plurality

of spacer members (10), each secured to a said plate,
located between said plates for maintaining the spacing

between the plates at a predetermined value, said spacer
members forming elongate strips (10) which extend parallel

to each other and to the plates and constitute barriers to
flow of liquid crystal material, characterized in that each

strip has an auxiliary strip (14) associated with it, which
auxiliary strip is secured to a said plate, runs parallel to

but spaced from the strip (10) with which it is associated
and on the same side of the strip with which it is

associated, and is of insufficient height to contact the 
plate other than that to which it is secured, the resulting

gap (15) between each auxiliary strip (14) and the plate
other than that to which it is secured being sufficiently

small that liquid crystal material voids are present between
each auxiliary strip and the strip with which it is

associated.
A device as claimed in Claim 3, wherein each auxiliary
strip (14) is secured to one said plate and the strip (10)

with which it is associated is secured to the other said
plate.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, including a
plurality of further spacer members (18) adhering to both of

said plates (1, 2).
