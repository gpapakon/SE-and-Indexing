<ABSTRACT>
A melt extrusion composition made by combining about 99.9 to about 98.5 weight percent of at least one polyester and about 0.1 to about 1.5 weight percent additive provides for a polyester or copolyester non-circular cross sectional fiber having at least four percent improved shape retention as compared to the same fiber made from a melt extrusion composition without the additive. The additive is present at the air-polymer interfacial surface during melt spinning. A method of making the fiber is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to non-round
cross-sectional shaped synthetic fibers. More
particularly, this invention relates to additives for
polymeric fluids which preserve the cross-sectional
shape of the fibers through reduction in surface tension
forces of the polymeric fluids.Certain benefits are derived from synthetic fibers
having cross-sectional shapes other than round. Fluid
movement, high bulk, insulation value, tactile, and
visual aesthetics are some of the many benefits. These
non-round cross-sectional shaped fibers are obtained
from melt spinning and solvent spinning of polymeric
fluids. Spinneret hole shapes are designed to provide
the desired cross-sectional shape of these fibers.During the spinning of these non-circular cross-sectional
shaped fibers, surface tension forces in the
spinning fluids act to deform, i.e. make circular, the
cross-sectional shapes engineered into the fibers
through the spinneret hole designs. However, the melt
viscosity of the polymeric fluid counteracts the surface
tension forces. Thus, the degree to which the original
cross-sectional shapes are deformed depends on the
initial value of the melt viscosity-to-surface tension
ratio, as well as the intensity of solidification.Prior art aimed at improving the retention of
noncircular cross-sectional shapes in fibers includes
reinforcement of the melt viscosity or reduction of the
surface tension forces. Reinforcement of the melt 
viscosity has been accomplished by reduction of melt
spinning temperature, by accelerated quenching, by
increasing the molecular weight, or by modification of
the chemical structure.Reduction of the surface tension forces in
polymeric fluids has been obtained for trilobal filament
cross sections of nylon by the addition of surface
active additives to the melt spinning process. In
particular, a primary aliphatic amide of a fatty acid
and an ethoxylated fatty acid markedly improved cross-sectional
shape retention of nylon fibers as
demonstrated in the comparative examples below.U.S. Patent No. 4,923,914 to Nohr et al. discloses
the use of an additive having moieties A and B for
providing desired characteristics in a thermoplastic
composition. The moieties together are compatible with
the thermoplastic composition at its melt extrusion
temperature and incompatible as separate compounds. It
is moiety B that provides for the desired
characteristic. Those characteristics disclosed in the
Nohr patent are improved wettability, enhanced
hydrophobicity, buffering capacity, ultraviolet light
absorp

<CLAIMS>
A method of improving shape retention of a non-circular
cross-sectional fiber comprising the steps of:


a) combining at least one polyester and an additive to form
a melt extrusion composition,
b) extruding said melt extrusion composition through a non-circular
cross-sectional shaped spinneret hole to form a

fiber,
c) quenching said fiber, and
d) taking up said fiber,
characterized in that

in step a) 99.9 to 98.5 weight percent of said at least one
polyester is combined with 0.1 to 1.5 weight percent of said

additive, said additive being selected from the group
consisting of a silicone, silicone copolymer or

fluoroaliphatic polymeric ester.
The method of claim 1 wherein said polyester is combined
in an amount of 99.6 to 99.0 weight percent with said

additive in an amount of 0.4 to 1.0 weight percent.
The method of claim 1 wherein said additive is
polydimethylsiloxane.
The method of claims 1 wherein said additive is a
polyalkylene oxide modified polydimethylsiloxane.
The method of claim 1 wherein said additive is a
polyether-polymethylsiloxane copolymer. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the fiber formed has at
least four percent improvement in shape retention as

compared to a second fiber made from a second melt
extrusion composition of said at least one polyester

without said additive and extruded through the spinneret
hole.

least forty percent improved shape retention as compared

to the second fiber.
