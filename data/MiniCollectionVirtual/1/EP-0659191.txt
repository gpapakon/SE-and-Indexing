<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the PUR protein, nucleotide sequences and expression vectors encoding PUR, and to methods for inhibiting PUR activity. The PUR proteins bind specifically to single stranded DNA in regions that coincide with eukaryotic origin of replication, one of such is at the c-myc gene region shown in the figure; this indicates that PUR proteins may function to regulate DNA replication. Inhibitors of PUR activity may be used to treat hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer.

 CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF PUR PROTEIN1. INTRODUCTIONThe present invention relates to the PUR protein, to nucleotide sequences and expression vectors encoding PUR, and to methods for inhibiting PUR activity.The PUR protein binds specifically to single stranded DNA in regions that coincide with eukaryotic origins of DNA replication and the 5 ' flanking regions of a number of cellular oncogenes that are frequently found amplified in cancer cells. Inhibitors of PUR activity may be useful for treatment of hyperÂ¬ proliferative diseases such as cancers that result from amplification and/or over expression of cellular oncogenes.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cell division is a carefully regulated process that involves two events, the duplication of genomic DNA and the physical division of the two daughter cells. Before each new cell division cycle, a decision must be made by the cell of whether to proceed through a new round of DNA replication or withdraw from the cell cycle into a quiescent non- proliferating state. When regulation of this process breaks down the result is uncontrolled cell proliferation which may lead to diseases such as cancer.Investigators of eukaryotic DNA replication have been faced with the challenge of identifying and characterizing both the specific chromosomal origins of replication and the regulatory proteins that control initiation of replication. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating DNA replication should lead to the development of therapeutic applications directed at inhibiting DNA replication and cell division. 

 Studies of DNA replication in mammalian cells has been difficult, due in part to the lack of suitable methods for mapping origins in large and complex genomes. In less complex organisms, such as prokaryotes, yeast and DNA tumor viruses, recent developments have lead to the identification of both cis-acting elements and polypeptides that bind specifically to these elements.Several proteins from prokaryotes have been characterized which play a role in DNA replication and which bind to single-stranded DNA. The amino acids involved in DNA binding by certain of these proteins have been identified (Gutierrez et al. , 1991 J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2104-2111) . However, none of these single- stranded DNA binding proteins is known to have any sequence specificity.In yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisae, cis-acting replication origins, referred to as ARS elements (autonomous replicating sequences) , have been identified by their ability to allow extrachromosomal maintenance
