<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIPSYCHOTIC OUINOLINE DERIVATIVES OF BENZODIOXANMETHYLAMINEBackground of the InventionUS Patent 4,704,390 claims compounds of the formula I as antipsychotic agents by virtue of their dopamine autoreceptor agonist activity. In formula I Het is selected from a group of heterocycles which includes the 2,3-pyrido, 3,4-pyrido and 2- hydroxy-3,4-pyrido moieties. X is carbon or nitrogen and A is phenyl or phenyl substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower thioalkoxy, halogen or trifluoromethyl, or A is 2-, 3- or 4-pyridinyl or 2-, 3- or 4-pyridinyl substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or halogen, or A is 2-, 4- or 5-pyrimidinyl or 2-, 4- or 5-pyrimidinyl substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or halogen, or A is 2-pyrazinyl or 2-pyrazinyl substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or halogen or A is 2- or 3-thienyl or 2- or 3-thienyl substituted by lower alkyl or hydrogen, or A is 2- or 3-furanyl or 2- or 3-furanyl substituted by lower alkyl or halogen, or A is 2- or 5-thiazolyl or 2- or 5-thiazolyl substituted by lower alkyl or halogen.Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 57,142,972 and Fr. Demande FR 2,477,542 claim compounds of formula II as antihistaminic, anti-aggressive, and adrenaline antagonistic agents, useful as central nervous system agents. In this formula, R is H, alkyl, phenylalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl; Z is N-phenylimino, (un)substituted benzylidene; n is 0 or 1; 7} is alkylene; and Z^ is CO, CH(OH), (un)substituted vinylene or ethylene.European Patent Application EP 170,213 discloses a series of N- alkylglutarimide derivatives of benzodioxan methanamine as antianxiety and antihypertensive agents. 

 Fozard et. al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 90, 273P (1987) disclose 8-[4-(l,4- benzodioxan-2-ylmethylamino)butyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione (MDL 72832) as a selective and stereospecific [(-)-MDL 72832 binds 32 times as much as the dextrorotary isomer at the 5-HTIA receptor site] ligand for 5-HTIA receptors.European Patent EP 236,930 discloses a series of 2-substituted-alkyl-l,2- benzisothiazole-3-one 1,1 -dioxide derivatives useful as anxiolytic and antihypertensive agents. Specifically claimed is 2-(4-(2,3-dihydro- l ,4-benzodiox-2- yl)methylamino)butyl)- 1 ,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one 1 , 1 -dioxide.Netherlands 6,407,012 claims compounds of general formula III, in which R,Rl and R2 are H, halogen, (1-6C) alkyl, or (1-6C) alkoxy and n is an integer 2-6, as calming, hypnotic and hypotensive agents. Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 58,219,114 claims similar compounds in which Rl and R2 taken together represent
