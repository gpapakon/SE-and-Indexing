<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrogen-absorbing
alloy electrode and, more specifically to improvement of
electrode materials for the purpose of providing a hydrogen-absorbing
alloy electrode that hardly undergoes cycle
deterioration, and activates in a short time and is readily
producible.In recent years, there have become highlighted metal
hydride secondary batteries with a positive electrode of a
metal compound such as nickel hydroxide and a negative
electrode utilizing a hydrogen-absorbing alloy, which is a
new material. This is because of their higher energy
density per unit weight or unit volume, thus realizing
higher capacity, compared with other type batteries such as
nickel-cadmium secondary battery.Ti-Mo-Ni alloys principally containing Ti, Mo and Ni
have been attracting attention as negative electrode material,
replacing conventional Mm-Ni alloys, for such metal
hydride secondary batteries, since they are particularly 
advantageous to increase battery capacity. Electrodes utilizing
this type alloys are prepared, like those utilizing
conventional alloys such as Mm-Ni alloys, by kneading an
alloy powder obtained by pulverizing blocks of the alloy
with a conductive agent and a binder, applying the obtained
mixture on an electrode support and then drying the mixture.However, the hydrogen-absorbing alloy electrodes using
the Ti-Mo-Ni alloy have had the following problems (1)
through (3).
(1) Ti-Mo-Ni alloys have been prepared by solidifying an
alloy melt at a relatively slow cooling rate of about 10 to
100°C/sec (the cooling rate differs depending on the alloy
type and its preparation process). This cooling rate makes
nonuniform the resulting alloy structure, and hence
electrodes utilizing the alloy tend to undergo, in the
course of charge and discharge cycles, surface corrosion to
form a dense inactive surface layer, thereby causing cycle
deterioration.(2) When a hydrogen-absorbing alloy is used as an electrode
material, it is a common practice to, after fabrication of
batteries therefrom, conduct a few times of charge and
discharge preliminarily, in order to activate the electrodes
by removing oxide film that has formed on the surface during
pulverization of alloy blocks and like occasions (hereinafter
this operation is referred to as "activation
treatment"). Since most Ti-Mo-Ni alloys are covered with a
large amount of oxide film, it takes a long time to complete 
activation treatment on them.(3) Ti-Mo-Ni alloys are hard and, at the same time, have
high ductility, so that such alloy blocks
