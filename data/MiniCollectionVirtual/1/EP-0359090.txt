<ABSTRACT>
The inclination sensor contains a freely moveable ball (4) in a trough (3, 3', 8). The position of rest of the ball (4) on the trough wall (3, 3', 13' 13") depends upon how "obliquely" the trough and thus also the housing (1) of the inclination sensor is situated with respect to the horizontal. From the fact that in its position of rest the ball (4) either does or does not connect to one another two regions of the trough which are electrically insulated from one another, e.g. the trough bottom (7) and the trough wall (3') it is to be derived in each case whether the position of the housing bottom (2) is situated inside or outside a class of a specific inclination. The annular subdivision (13, 13', 13") of the wall surface of the trough enables a classification of the amount of the inclination, a sectoral subdivision (10...10"'") enables a classification of the direction of the inclination. By a combination of the sectoral and azimuthal division of the trough wall it is possible to detect both the direction and the amount of the inclination in a grid.
