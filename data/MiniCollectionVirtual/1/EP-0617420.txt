apparatuses is disclosed, which comprises

 
   a semiconductor laser,

 
   a mirror for reflecting a light beam emitted from the 

semiconductor laser,
 

   a diffraction grating for dividing the light beam into zero-order, 
plus and minus first-order beams,

 
   a holographic diffraction grating being arranged at an 

optical path of the beams divided by the diffraction grating,
 

   an objective lens for focusing the beams on a disk and 
causing the beams reflected from the disk to be incident on the 

holographic diffraction grating to diffract the beams, and
 

   a photodetector for detecting a tracking error signal by 
receiving the beams diffracted by the holographic diffraction 

grating,
 

   the semiconductor laser has a beam incident area which the

   the beam incident area acts to scatter or to absorb the 
incident beam. 
As a result, the optical head is able to obtain the stable 
tracking error signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical head for optical
recording and reproducing apparatuses.An optical head integrating a light source and a photodetector
has been proposed. The optical head disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open JP-A-01.035.737 is an example. Fig.13 shows a perspective
view of the optical head disclosed above and Fig.14 shows a
schematic view of its optical system. The optical head chip 1a
has first and second photodetectors 9 and 10 having five regions
respectively on first and second substrates 2 and 8. The second
substrate 8 is mounted on the first substrate 2. A semiconductor
laser chip 5 is mounted on the second substrate 8 and a monitoring
photodetector 4 is also formed on the second substrate 8.A prism 11 is set on the first substrate 2. The prism 11
has a trapezoidal section, its grade plane 11a acts as a mirror
and its vertical plane 11b faces to a exit of the semiconductor
laser chip 5. A first diffraction grating 12 is formed on a top
plane 11c of the prism 11. A second diffraction grating 13 is
arranged above the first diffraction grating 12.The outline of operation this optical head is as follows: A
beam emitted from the semiconductor laser chip 5 is reflected by 
the grade plane 11a of the prism 11 and incident onto the first
diffraction grating 12. The diffraction grating 12 divides the
beam into three beams, a zero-order beam for reading information
and plus and minus first-order beams for detecting a tracking
error. The three beams pass the second diffraction grating 13
and are focused by an objective lens 18 on a disk 19. The three
beams focused on the disk 19 are reflected from the disk 19 and
are incident onto the second diffraction grating 13 through the
objective lens 18. The incident beams are divided into plus and
minus first-order beams by the second diffraction grating 13 and
transmitted to the first and second photodetectors 9 and 10.Because the first and second photodetectors 9 and 10 are
arranged in front of and behind the exact point of focus as shown
in Fig.15, spot sizes imaged on the photodetectors 9 and 10
associated with the shift of the focus point on the disk 19 cause
the reverse change to each other. The focus error is detected by
the beam size method utilizing this phenomenon. The tracking
error is detected by a three-beam method employing the plus and
minus first-order beams for the tracking generated by the first
diffraction grating 12.When the semiconductor laser chip 5 is arranged in close
proximity to the prism 11 to miniaturize
