<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for preparing a crystalline,
sodium percarbonate comprising the stages wherein hydrogen
peroxide and sodium carbonate are contacted in an aqueous
solution to form dissolved sodium percarbonate, which is
precipitated from the solution by crystallization and
recovered.
Sodium percarbonate is a water-soluble, crystalline peroxygen
compound with the molecular formula 2Na2CO3 . 3H2O2. It has a
theoretical active oxygen concentration (AO) of 15.28% by
weight. Sodium percarbonate is relatively well water-soluble,
sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide being released in the
solution. Owing to this characteristic sodium percarbonate
has, in fact, a widespread application as a bleaching agent.
It is particularly suitable for bleaching textiles and for
removing coloured stains from textiles in industry and
households.Compared to another common bleaching agent, sodium perborate,
sodium percarbonate is considerably faster dissolved in cold
water and does not require any special bleaching activator,
and is thus also energy-saving. Moreover, compared to
perborates and chlorous bleaching agents, sodium percarbonate
does not generate any polluting residues.The stocking of sodium percarborate involves certain
problems. In a cooled, dry storage it is conserved as such
for long periods cf time. If, however during storage, the
relative humidity of air is greater than the critical
relative humidity of the product sodium percarbonate will
absorb water from the surrounding air. This process is
enhanced by a temperature raise and causes a reduction of the
AO concentration as a function of time. Sodium percarbonate
will be dissolved in the absorbed water into a saturated
solution consisting of sodium carbonate and hydrogen
peroxide. Sodium carbonate increases the basicity of the 
solution, which, again, accelerates the natural decomposition
of hydrogen peroxide in the solution. Moreover, due to the
preparation process and the raw materials, impurities may
occur in the product, which accelerate the decomposition of
hydrogen peroxide. Such impurities with a catalytic activity
are transition metal ions, among others.In fact, when preparing sodium percarbonate with
crystallization methods, it is commonly known to carry out a
preliminary purification of sodium carbonate by adding water-soluble
Mg salt to its solution, the Mg salt precipitating
magnesium carbonate from the solution and metal salt
impurities being coprecipitated. In addition to this, the
product may be stabilized by adding agents
