<ABSTRACT>
The steering wheel includes a central body (7) secured around its periphery to the coating (6) of the rim (1) and the spokes (2), as well as an outer layer (8) which continuously covers this coating (6) and the front face of the central body (7). The mounting piece (23) is a ring with an internal outline exhibiting two portions of a circle of different diameters and a binding screw. The steering column has a top, the end section (25) of which has a smaller diameter than the section (24) surrounded by the hub (3), and a groove at the base of the end section (25) in which the mounting piece (23) is accommodated.

Steering wheel for motor vehicles, having a frame, a
cladding in which said frame is disposed, one external layer

which coats said cladding, and in addition a central body,
having a front face, and joined at the periphery with said

cladding in which the rim and arms of the said frame are
disposed; characterised in that said one external layer (8; 8')

continuously coats said front face of the central body (7) and
said cladding (6; 6'; 6A, 6B).
Steering wheel according to Claim 1, characterised in that
said central body (7) and said cladding (6; 6'; 6A, 6B) are

made from a relatively rigid thermoplastic, and said external
layer (8) from a relatively soft thermoplastic.
Steering wheel according to Claim 1, characterised in that
said cladding (6; 6'; 6A, 6B) and said central body (7) are

made from a relatively rigid thermoplastic, and said external
layer (8') from a polyurethane foam.
Steering wheel according to either one of Claims 1 or 3,
characterised in that it has an air bag module (9, 10) carried

by said central body (7).
Steering wheel according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that it has a head-impact module (35; 39)

carried by said central body (7).
Steering wheel according to Claim 5, characterised in that
said head-impact module (35) has an energy absorbing means

formed by deformable flat elements (37, 38). 
Steering wheel according to Claim 5, characterised in that
said head-impact module (39) has an energy absorbing means

formed by a block (40) of cellular material.
Steering wheel according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that it has at least one electrical contactor

(18) carried by said central body (7).
Steering wheel according to any one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that it has a peripheral frame (1, 2) disposed

in said cladding and a central frame (3, 5) having a hub (3)
and arms (5) fixed at the rear to the arms (2) of the

peripheral frame.
Steering wheel according to any one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that it has a rear shell (19, 19').
Steering wheel according to Claim 10, characterised in
that said rear shell (19) has a lateral access flap (28)

allowing the fitting of a mounting piece (23) for fixing the
hub (3) of the steering wheel to a steering column (4).
Steering wheel according to Claim 10, characterised in
that said rear shell (19') has access flaps (33) allowing the

fitting of a mounting element for fixing a module (9, 10; 35;
39) carried by said central body (7) to said arms (5).
Steering wheel according to any one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that the central body (7) adheres at the

periphery to the cladding (6) of the rim and arms.
Steering wheel according to any one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that the central body (7) is moulded on at the

periphery by the cladding (6) of the rim and arms. 
Steering wheel according to any one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that the central body (7) and the cladding (6)

of the rim and arms are moulded in a single piece.
Method for moulding said central body (7) and said
external layer (8) of a steering wheel according to Claim 13,

characterised by the following steps :

placing the rim (1) and arms (2) previously clad in a mould
adapted to obtaining the said central body (7) in a first

material, and to obtaining a lower portion of the external
layer (6), situated below the joint face (29), in a second

material;
injecting said first and second materials into the said
mould;
changing the top half-mould for another top half-mould
adapted, in cooperation with the bottom half-mould in which the

previously obtained assembly remains, to obtaining, in the said
second material, the remainder of the said external layer (8),

situated above the joint face (29); and
injecting said second material.
