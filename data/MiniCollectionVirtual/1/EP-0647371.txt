<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to a circuit arrangement for reducing 
the effective capacitance of a power switch and, more particularly, for reducing the 
effective capacitance of a power switch connected in series association with an 
inductor. As is well known to those skilled in the art, the inherent characteristic of an 
inductive component, such as a motor winding or a relay, is that an electric current 
will continue to flow through the inductor after a switch connected in series with the 
inductor is opened for the purpose of causing current through the inductor to cease. 
This characteristic of inductive components is typically compensated by providing a 
snubber circuit (i.e. a means for dissipating the stored energy in the inductor) in 
parallel with the inductor. If a capacitor is connected in series with the inductor, the 
capacitive and inductive components combine to create a resonant circuit arrangement 
that can result in ringing (i.e. resonant oscillation). If the inductor is used in a circuit 
which is particularly sensitive to high frequencies, this ringing is particularly 
deleterious. In certain types of circuits, high frequency signals are injected into the 
circuit to pass through the inductors so that certain parameters of the circuit can be 
measured. The creation of high frequencies in the circuit as a result of the resonance 
created by the inductive and capacitive components can be particularly 
disadvantageous in these types of circuits. United States Patent application Serial No. 07/658,482, which was filed on 
February 20, 1991 
describes a means for determining the position of a rotor in a switched reluctance 
motor by injecting a high frequency signal into the stator windings of the motor. The 
position of the rotor poles, relative to each stator pole winding, will affect the 
amplitude and phase of the high frequency injected signal and enable the rotor 
position to be determined as a function of these effects. In a circuit arrangement of 
this type, the switch capacitance parallels the coupling capacitor and adds to the 
coupling capacitance to set the resonant frequency used to determine the rotor 
position. The inductance of the motor winding pairs reacts with the circuit series 
capacitance; the intended coupling capacitors and the parasitic switch capacitance. 
The signal is injected into a circuit which is detuned by the operational variation of  
 
the switch capacitance. Further, the signal is divided inversely to the value of each 
capacitance. The
