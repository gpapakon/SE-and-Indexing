<ABSTRACT>
A method for dyeing an optical component such as a lens 
or filter. A coating (3, 23, 32, 42) of dyeing solution is 

formed on a surface of a lens (4, 24, 33, 44) and the lens is 
subjected to a nonuniform heating treatment in dependence on 

the position within the surface to obtain the desired color 
density gradient of the lens (4, 24, 33, 44). In accordance 

with the positions within such surface, a nonuniform 
integrated heating amount distribution provides the desired 

color density gradient with excellent reproducibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for dyeing an 
optical component such as an eyeglass lens or optical filter. As for example, there has been a great demand for 
colored eyeglass lenses as articles which are associated with 
the current fashion and style and are high in added value. 
In accordance with conventional lens coloring techniques, it 
has been the practice to repeat a plurality of times the 
operation of preparing a dyeing solution by dispersing a 
dye in a mainly water-type dispersion medium, maintaining the 
resulting dyeing solution at a temperature of 100 Â°C or less 
under the atmospheric pressure, dipping a lens in the dyeing 
solution in this condition and taking out the lens from the 
solution thereby effecting the dyeing with the desired color 
tone and color density. In this case, generally it has been 
frequent to perform a so-called half coloring in which about 
one half of the areal extent of a lens sueface is dyed with 
a gentle color density gradient so as to gradually decrease 
the color tone toward the center of the lens. However, the dyeing of optical components by the 
conventional method of the above-mentioned type is 
disadvantageous in that to obtain the desired color tone and 
color density tends to have recourse to the long experience 
of a dyeing operator, and particularly where the dyeing with 
a gentle color density gradient is effected, the 
reproducibility of products of the same finish is 
deteriorated and it is difficult to prevent variations in the  
 
color density due to the following processing operations such 
as a protective coating. It is the primary object of the present invention to 
provide a method for dyeing optical components which 
overcomes the foregoing deficiencies in the prior art, is 
exellent in the reproducibility of dye finish and is capable 
of performing a stable dyeing, and more particularly such 
method well suited for the mass production of dyed optical 
lenses. To accomplish the above object, in accordance with a 
basic aspect of the present invention there is thus provided 
a method for dyeing an optical component including a step of 
applying a nonuniform heating to the surface of an optical 
component covered with a dye coating in dependence on the 
position within the surface, and the nonuniform heating is 
controlled so as to obtain an integrated heating amount 
distribution corresponding to a predetermined color density 
gradient whereby depending on the position within the surface 
the amount of the dye penetrating to the
