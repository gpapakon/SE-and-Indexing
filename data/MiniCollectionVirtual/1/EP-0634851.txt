<ABSTRACT>
Process and device for the equalization the transmission 
time To of m radio base stations (RFP) linked through one 

or more PCM lines to a master unit (MUI).
 

The process consists of measuring the delay (RRS) by which 
the slave stations receive a reference signal (Tm) emitted 

by the master unit, and storing in each slave station (RFP) 
a representative information of the complement of said 

delay (RRS) with respect to the above-said transmission 
time To.

 
The device comprises a counter (CK), qualified for the 

calculation of said reference signal (Tm), set up by the 
synchronism signal allocated in the time slot zero of the 

PCM frame, and blocked by a signal (r) available at the 
output of a recognition unit of the time slot zero of the 

PCM frame emitted by the interlocutor station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
equalization of a plurality of radio base stations in a 
telecommunication network where the condition of time 
synchronism between m stations is required so that all 
stations emit a frame in synchronism in the zone covered by 
the network. The invention is preferably applied in private 
telephony systems known as DECT (Digital European 
Telecommunication Cordless), however it can be used in a 
general way in radio mobile systems where the time 
synchronization in transmission is required as for example 
in simulcast systems. The structure of a possible DECT system is 
schematically illustrated in Figure 1. It comprises groups of radio fixed parts RFP with the 
stations of each group connected among them for example by 
means of a "dorsal" link, and in particular a PCM link at 2 
Mbit/sec. The dorsals link up with the PBX interconnecting 
station between the DECT system and the public telephone 
network PSTN through the same number of Modular Unit 
Interfaces (MUI). The RFPs can also be linked to the MUI unit according 
to other configurations like for example the "star" like 
one, etc. as will be explained hereafter. The radio portable parts RPP set up connections with 
the RFP stations via radio and from there with the public 
network PSTN or another radio portable part RPP. The radio base stations acquire informations in order 
to transmit a DECT radio frequency frame in a synchronous 
way, that is all stations of the network must transmit  
 
simultaneously their frame at a time To, as required by the 
specifications of the above mentioned DECT system. The informations setting up the DECT frame are 
transferred to the RFP stations along the PCM dorsal, and 
therefore each RFP receives the signals with a certain 
delay, which increases with the growing of the distance 
between the RFP and the MUI. Especially if the MUI or the 
PABX send a synchronism signal Tm along this dorsal it is 
received by the stations in successive times, and therefore 
- where they would transmit the PCM signals as a response 
to the reception of the synchronism signal Tm - the 
condition of time synchronisataion between the station 
would not be satisfied, a synchronization which is required 
for the correct functioning of the systems at issue. In order to satisfy this synchronization conditions it 
is necessary to introduce for each one of the RFPs a 
different frame emission delay in response to the reception 
of the synchronism pulse Tm, and this delay must be of such
