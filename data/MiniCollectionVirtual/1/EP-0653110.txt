<ABSTRACT>
A reverse-polarity protection is disclosed for coupling an electric circuit (2) to an energy and information conducting conductor system (3). At least one coupling path (5) comprises a controllable element (4) as reverse-polarity protection, hereinafter referred to as reverse-polarity protection element (4). When an emitter circuit (2) is inductively coupled to the conductor system (3) by means of a converter (6) and with a transmission coil (7) on the primary side, and with a free-running circuit for a changeover current to discharge the transmission circuit in an LC circuit, the changeover current is taken via the control electrode of the reverse-polarity protection component (4).
