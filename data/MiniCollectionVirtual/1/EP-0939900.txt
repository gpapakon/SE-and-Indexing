<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method for identifying a patient at risk to developing fibrinogen receptor antagonist-induced thrombocytopenia which comprises incubating patient plasma with a GPIIb/IIIa receptor:GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist complex to form a GPIIb/IIIa receptor:GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist:plasma antibody complex, incubating the GPIIb/IIIa receptor:GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist:plasma antibody complex with a secondary anti-human detectable antibody to form a GPIIb/IIIa receptor:GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist:plasma antibody:secondary anti-human detectable antibody complex, and detecting the presence of the secondary anti-human detectable antibody in the GPIIb/IIIa receptor:GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist:plasma antibody:secondary anti-human detectable antibody complex.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONDETECTION OF ANTAGONIST-DEPENDENT GPIIb/IIIa RECEPTOR ANTIBODIESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Drug-induced thrombocytopenia contributes to morbitity and, occasionally, mortality in patients treated with a wide range of medications (Karpatkin, Am. J. Med. Sci. 262:68 (1971)). More than 100 different medications have been implicated in drug-induced thrombocytopenia, including heparin, quinine, quinidine and sulfonamide antibiotics (Shulman et al. Hemostasis and Thrombosis (ed 2) Philadelphia, PA, Lippincott (1987) p.452, and Kracke et al. JAMA 122: 168 (1943).Drug-dependent antibodies reactive with platelets have been identified in only a few instances. Curtis et al., Blood, vol. 84, no.l (July 1) 1984: pp. 176-183, applied flow cytometry to the detection of such antibodies induced by sulfonamide antibiotics. Visentin et al. Transfusion Oct. 1990 30 (8) pp. 694-700 describes detection of drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies by antigen-capture ELISA and flow cytometry. The present invention is a means for identifying, in a patient, the presence of one or more antibodies in GP Hb/IHa receptor (fibrinogen receptor) antagonist-induced thrombocytopenia which recognize GPIIb/IIIa receptor:GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist complexes formed with purified platelets or purified GPIIb/IIIa receptor and a selected GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. Identification of such antibodies identifies the patient as being at risk to development of thrombocytopenia resulting from administration to the patient of the selected GP Ilb IIIa receptor antagonist.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe invention is a method for identifying a patient at risk to developing fibrinogen receptor antagonist-induced thrombocytopenia resulting from treatment of the patient with a selected fibrinogen receptor antagonist, which comprises reacting patient plasma with a GPIIb/IIIa receptor: GPIIb/HIa receptor antagonist complex to form a first reaction 

product, reacting the first reaction product with a secondary anti-human detectable antibody to form a second reaction product, and detecting in the second reaction product the level of binding between the secondary anti- human detectable antibody and the GPIIb/IIIa receptor: GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist complex. An indication that the secondary anti-human detectable antibody binds to the GPIIb/IIIa receptor: GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist complex indicates the presence of interaction between the GPIIb/πia receptoπGPIIbΛHa receptor antagonist complex and a patient plasma antibody.
