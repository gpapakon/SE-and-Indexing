<ABSTRACT>
The mechanical arrangement of the invention for space-saving vehicle parking has at least one entry and exit (EA) and a plurality of parking spaces (EP) and there is a plurality of side-by-side, sideways movable stacking trucks (SW), each of which is designed in such a way that a plurality of pairs of adjacent pallets (PL) to take parked vehicles is arranged on it one above the other. A lifting passage (HGS) can be created between any two stacking trucks (SW) by moving said trucks sideways. A lift truck (HW) can travel to this lifting passage and take individual pallets (PL) from or place them on a stacking truck (SW) beside the lifting passage (HGS). This lift truck (HW) can lift any pallet (PL) to the level of at least one entry or exit (EA).

Facility for the space-saving parking of motor
vehicles, having at least one entrance and exit (EA) and

having a multiplicity of parking spaces (EP), it being
the case that


a) a multiplicity of stacking carriages (SW), which are
arranged one beside the other and can be displaced to the

side, is provided,
b) by lateral displacement of the stacking carriages
(SW), a lifting passage (HGS) can be produced between any

two selected stacking carriages (SW),

characterized in that

c) each stacking carriage (SW) is formed such that a
multiplicity of pairs of pallets (PL), located one beside

the other and intended for receiving parked motor
vehicles, can be arranged thereon one above the other

and/or one beneath the other,
d) a pair of lifting carriages (HW) can travel to the
lifting passage (HGS), which pair of lifting carriages

can remove individual pallets (PL) from a stacking
carriage (SW) adjacent to the lifting passage (HGS), move

them vertically through the lifting passage, and
introduce them into such a stacking carriage (SW),
e) said pair of lifting carriages (HW) can lift any pallet 
(PL) onto the level of at least one entrance or exit (EA),

and
f) each lifting carriage (HW) is equipped with a
lifting fork (HGB) having pivotable extension arms (ALS).
Facility according to Claim 1, in the case of
which at least one conveying apparatus (FE) for the

lateral transportation of pallets (PL) is provided above
or beneath the stacking carriages (SW), it being possible

for pallets (PL) to be transported, by means of said
conveying apparatus, from 
a lifting passage (HGS) to an
entrance or exit (EA) and in the opposite direction.
Facility according to Claim 2, of which the
conveying apparatus (FE) comprises a rail system (SSY),

made up of rail elements (SE), and a chain conveyor (KF)
made up of two parallel chain systems (KS) with chains

(KN) on which there are provided pallet push rods (PSS)
which engage in pushing niches (PSN) of the pallets and

convey said pallets (PL).
Facility of one of the preceding claims, in the
case of which the pallets (PL) exhibit lifting grates

(HR) which can be displaced laterally at the front and
rear in the region of the vehicle axles, which can be

lifted and lowered with respect to the pallet plane and
with the aid of which the central position of the parked

vehicle in the transverse direction of the pallet can be
produced, by displacing the lifting grates.
Facility according to one of the preceding
claims, in the case of which the stacking carriages (SW)

are configured as steel structures which, on both sides
of central uprights (MS), can receive pallets (PL) on

extension arms (AL).
Facility according to one of the preceding
claims, in the case of which the stacking carriages (SW)

travel on rails.
Facility according to one of the preceding
claims, in the case of which the stacking carriages (SW)

can be connected to one another via magnetic couplings 
(MK).
Facility according to one of the preceding
claims, on whose end sides (SS) there are provided push

and pull rods (SZ), by means of which the stacking
carriages (SW) can be displaced laterally.
Facility according to one of the preceding
claims, in the case of which the lifting carriages (HW)

travel independently on rails over the entire length of
the facility, on both sides of the stacking carriages

(SW).
Facility according to one of the preceding
claims, in the case of which means for the intermediate

storage of temporarily non-required pallets are provided
outside the storage and retrieval carriages.
Facility according to Claim 10, in the case of
which the means for the intermediate storage of

temporarily non-required pallets are designed in the form
of stack-type stores with lifting tables (HT) for receiving

and/or releasing pallets.
