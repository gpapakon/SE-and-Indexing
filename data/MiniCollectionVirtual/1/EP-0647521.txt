<ABSTRACT>
A mold which can be used to manufacture a high 
performance tire with excellent cornering performance 

and high speed durability. 
A mold (1) used for vulcanizing a pneumatic tire (6) the 
aspect ratio of which is not more than 50% and having, 

for reinforcing a tread portion (5), a belt (3) 
comprising at least two rubber coated cord layers having 

cords arranged obliquely at angles with respect to an 
equatorial plane (2) of the tire of 26째 or more, and a 

belt reinforcing layer (4) arranged outside the belt (3) 
and comprising at least one organic fiber cord layer 

having cords arranged substantially parallel with 
respect to the equatorial plane of the tire, wherein a 

section profile of a mold surface (7) facing the tread 
portion (5) has a radius smaller than that of a nominal 

section profile by 1% or more of a section width (W) of 
the tire and forms a convex curve to a cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mold used for vulcanizing a
pneumatic tire having an aspect ratio of not more than
50%, preferably a tire having a size of 255/50R16 or
more. The mold of this invention makes it possible to
manufacture a tire with excellent cornering performance
as well as high speed durability.In order to meet the demand for high performance
pneumatic tires, low profile tires have been developed.
In particular, in high performance tires having sizes of
255/50R16 or more, large angles of cords of the belt
layer, for instance 26째 or more with respect to an
equatorial plane of the tire, have been adopted in order
to obtain high speed durability and riding
comfortability.Generally, a section profile of a mold surface facing a
tread portion forms a concave curve to a cavity.In high performance tires which are manufactured by
conventional molds, the circumferential tension of the
belt is lower than that of the belt of a conventional
tire whose cords are arranged normally (approximately
20째 with respect to an equatorial plane of the tire).
Therefore, as shown in Fig. 7 of the accompanying
drawings, a radius 10 of the tire inflated with standard 
inner pressure (chain line) tends to be enlarged
compared with a nominal radius 8 of the tire (broken
line).In a low profile high performance tire, a foot-print
should be a rectangular shape. However, in the above
mentioned tire, because the radius of the tire inflated
with standard inner pressure tends to be enlarged
compared with the nominal radius resulting in increasing
a contact pressure of a center portion caused by
enlargement of the center portion, the foot-print
becomes an elliptical shape whose contact area of both
sides of the tread is decreased as shown in Fig. 5 of
the accompanying drawings. Tires having such foot-print
cannot provide enough cornering performance because of
the small contact area of both sides of the tread.
Further, the contact pressure converges to the center
area of the tread, and tread rubbers of the center area
partially generate heat. As a result, the high speed
durability deteriorates.Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide
a mold used for vulcanizing a pneumatic tire which has
excellent cornering performance and high speed
durability by preventing enlargement of the radius of
the tire compared to the nominal radius under standard
inner pressure. By "the nominal radius" there is meant
the dimension of the tire based on the tire regulations 
of each country.The present invention in one aspect provides a

A mold (1) for vulcanizing a pneumatic tire (6) the aspect ratio of
which is not more than 50% and having a tread portion (5), characterized in

that a cross-sectional profile of a mold surface (7) facing the tread portion
(5) has a radius smaller than that of a nominal cross-sectional profile by 1%

or more and 2% or less of a section width (W) of the tire and forms a
convex curve to a cavity in said mold.
A method of making a low aspect ratio pneumatic tire the aspect
ratio of which is not more than 50% and having, for reinforcing a tread

portion (5), a belt (3) comprising at least two rubber coated cord layers
having cords arranged obliquely at angles with respect to an equatorial

plane (2) of the tire of 26째 or more, and a belt reinforcing layer (4) arranged
outside the belt and comprising at least one organic fiber cord layer having

cords arranged substantially parallel with respect to the equatorial plane of
the tire, characterized by providing a mold (1) having a cross-sectional

profile of a mold surface (7) facing the tread portion (5) of the tire to be
molded with a radius smaller than that of a nominal cross-sectional profile

of said tire by 1% or more and 2% or less of a section width (W) of the
molded tire in its uninflated state, said mold surface forming a convex

curve to a cavity in said mold, and molding said low aspect ratio tire. 
A method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that said mold
surface cross-sectional profile facing the tread portion of the tire to be

molded is asymmetric such that a center of a tread foot-print of said molded
tire after inflation with standard inner pressure is shifted with respect to a

tread center of said tire.
