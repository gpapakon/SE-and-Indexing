<ABSTRACT>
The heating device comprises a substantially plate-like radiant body having a first surface to provide radiant heat and a second surface to which a flat electric heating element is secured. At least the rear, but preferably both the rear and sides, of the radiator are covered with a polyurethane foam. There is an electronic thermostat which maintains the temperature of the radiant body at a predetermined level.

<CLAIMS>
Heating device with an essentially plate-like 
radiant element (2), having a first surface (2a) 

for giving off heat radiation, as well as a 
second surface (2b) opposite to it, to which a 

flatly designed electric heating device (10) 
is arranged.
 
   characterized in that
 
   at least the second surface (2b) of the radiant 

element as well as the heating device (10) is 
covered with a plastic high-resistance foam 

layer, foamed directly on to the second surface 
(2b) of the radiant element (2). 
Heating device in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that the high-resistance foam 

layer is designed in such a way that it covers 

the back side forming the second surface and at 
least two opposing side walls (3, 4) of the 

radiant element. 
Heating device in accordance with claim 2, 
characterized in that the plastic high-resistance 

foam layer is designed in such a way that it 
covers the back side of the radiant element as 

well as its lateral edges. 
Heating device in accordance with at least one of 
the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 

high-resistance foam layer is between 3 and 
12 mm thick. 
Heating device in accordance with claim 4, 
characterized in that the high-resistance foam 

layer is between 6 and 10 mm thick at the 
back wall.  

 
Heating device in accordance with at least one of 
the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 

high-resistance foam layer includes polyurethane. 
Heating device in accordance with at least one of 
the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the 

heating device includes two plastic plates or 
foils, an electric heating wire being arranged in 

between. 
Heating device in accordance with at least one of 
the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that a 

control device is provided, connected with a 
temperature feeler, arranged at or in the radiant 

element, keeping the temperature of the radiant 
element to an essentially constant value during 

operation. 
Heating device in accordance with claim 8, 
characterized in that the control device is 

designed in such a way that the heating device 
is switched off, as soon as the temperature of 

the radiant element exceeds a predetermined 
limit value, mainly determined by safety 

deliberations. 
Heating device in accordance with claim 8, 
characterized in that the control unit includes 

electronic components designed in such a way that 
the temperature of the radiant body is kept 

within a small variation range, preferably in a 
range between +1° and -1°C, of the predetermined 

desired value.
