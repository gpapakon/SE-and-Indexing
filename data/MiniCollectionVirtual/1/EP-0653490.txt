<ABSTRACT>
A gene having the activity of a hydroxylase that can convert the hydrogen atom at the 25-position of a vitamin D into a hydroxyl 
group is obtained from the strain of an actinomyces of the genus 
Nocardia
 or 
Amycolata
. A 25-hydroxylated vitamin D 
can be prepared efficiently in a high yield by transforming 
Streptomyces lividans
 or 
Streptomyces griseus
 with a plasmid bearing 
the above gene and treating a vitamin D having a hydrogen atom at the 25-position with the resultant transformant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gene 
responsible for a hydroxylase activity, which is present in 
bacteria belonging to Actinomycetes, especially to the genus 
Nocardia or the genus Amycolata, and isolation of a DNA 
bearing the gene as well as use thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to a gene responsible for expression of a hydroxylase 
activity which is present in bacteria belonging to 
Actinomycetes, especially to the genus Nocardia or the genus 
Amycolata and which encodes a protein having a hydroxylase 
activity which is capable of converting the hydrogen atom at 
the 25-position of a vitamin D compound having a hydrogen 
atom at the 25 position into a hydroxyl group, or a DNA 
bearing the gene; the gene responsible for the expression of 
the hydroxylase activity existing in a DNA fragment of about 
3.83 kb or a DNA bearing the aforesaid gene is obtained by 
partial digestion of chromosomal DNA from the cells of 
Actinomycetes with restriction enzyme Sau 3AI. It is known to hydroxylate the 1- and 25-positions 
of vitamin D compounds enzymologically using microorganism 
(microbiological conversion) (Japanese Patent Application  
 
KOKAI Nos.2-469 and 2-231089). However, a gene of 
microorganism origin which is responsible for the 
hydroxylase activity of a vitamin D compound is unknown 
heretofore. It was thus insufficient as a technology to 
increase the amount of a hydroxylase responsible for the 
hydroxylase activity of a vitamin D compound in bacteria or 
to produce the hydroxylase in an industrial scale. In 
animal, a gene for vitamin Dâ‚ƒ 25-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 
from rat liver is known, including its cloning (Japanese 
Patent Application KOKAI No. 3-232493). However, the enzyme 
activity of the cloned gene was insufficiently expressed in 
microorganisms. A recent report reveals that the same gene 
from rat liver expressed in cytoplasmic reticulum of yeast 
increased the expression of the activity in microorganism 
approximately 50 times larger than in the method previously 
disclosed ("JISEDAI SANGYO KIBAN SYMPOSIUM" (Symposium of 
Principal Industry in the Next Generation), held September 
13, 1991). However, the yield does not yet reach the level 
obtained by conversion using a microorganism having a 
vitamin D hydroxylase activity. Even though the gene for vitamin D 25-hydroxylase 
cytochrome P-450 from rat liver is cloned and successfully 
expressed in a microorganism, the yield is not comparable to 
that obtained by conversion using a microorganism having
