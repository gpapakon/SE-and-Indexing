Sustained release diltiazem formulation for 
oral administration comprising a microgranule free of 

organic acid possibly having an irritating effect, the 
said microgranule comprising: 


(a) a central inactive spherical particle; 
(b) a plurality of alternating first and second layers 
surrounding the spherical particle to form a core, 

the first layer comprising a water soluble, pharmaceutically 
acceptable polymeric material, and the 

second layer comprising diltiazem or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof; and 
(c) an outer coating comprising
 
first inner membrane layers applied to said core, 

said first inner membrane layers, amounting from 1 
to 20, comprising a first water insoluble pharmaceutically 

acceptable polymeric material, and
 
a single outer membrane forming a relatively thick 

and homogeneous layer surrounding said first inner 
membrane layers and comprising a second water insoluble 

pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric material 
different from said first water insoluble 

pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric material. 
Formulation according to claim 1, wherein the 
water soluble, pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric 

material is selected from the group comprising polyvinylpyrrolidone, 
polyethyleneglycol, polyvinyl alcohol and 

their mixtures. 
Formulation according to claim 1, wherein the 
first water insoluble, pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric 

material is ethylcellulose and wherein the second 
water insoluble, pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric 

material is selected from the group comprising a copolymer 
of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid esters, cellulose 

acetate phthalate, and those marketed under the trademarks 
EUDRAGIT L, EUDRAGIT RS and AQUACOAT.  

 
Formulation according to claim 1, including a 
lubricant in said first membrane layers and in said single 

outer membrane, said lubricant being selected from the 
group comprising talc, calcium stearate, zinc stearate or 

magnesium stearate. 
Formulation according to claim 1, comprising a 
plasticizer in said single outer membrane. 
Formulation according to claim 5, wherein said 
plasticizer is selected from the group comprising diethylphthalate, 

polyethyleneglycols, dibutyl phthalate and 
triacetin.
