<CLAIMS>
Method of briquetting and compacting fine-grained
materials, 
characterized in
 that dry shredded paper or
dry shredded cardboard is added to the dust-like

materials and homogeneously mixed with said materials and
then the pourable mixture to be pressed is, without any

further supply of moisture, pressed using a pressing
pressure greater than 40 MPa.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that waste
paper or waste cardboard is used.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that
the waste paper is shredded extremely finely.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized
in
 that the waste paper is shredded in a mill with a
discharge wire or grate, the mesh size or gap width of

which is smaller than 5 mm.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized
in
 that the waste paper is first chopped into pieces and
then shredded in a beater blade mill.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
in
 that the mixture to be pressed contains less than 10%
by weight of shredded paper.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized
in
 that the mixture to be pressed contains up to 5% by
weight of shredded waste paper.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized
in
 that the pressing pressure is between 120 and 150 MPa. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized
in
 that the pressed mixture is subsequently granulated.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 9,

characterized in
 that an inorganic material is used
as fine-grained material.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized
in
 that an organic material is used as fine-grained
material.
