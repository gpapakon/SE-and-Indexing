<ABSTRACT>
Method of recovering energy from waste liquors from pulp processes, wherein the waste liquor is burned in a waste liquor recovery boiler (18) and energy is recovered from the flue gases by producing saturated or partially superheated steam in the recovery boiler. According to the invention, a portion of the waste liquor is gasified in a gasifying reactor (16) in order to produce combustion gas. The combustion gas is burned in a separate superheating boiler, in which the steam produced in the recovery boiler is superheated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of recovering 
energy from waste liquors from pulp processes. The invention 
relates especially to a method wherein waste liquor is 
burned in a waste liquor recovery boiler, e.g. in a soda 
recovery boiler, and wherein heat is recovered from the 
resulting flue gases by producing saturated and/or partially 
superheated steam in the recovery boiler, which steam is 
superheated in a superheating boiler. When combusting waste liquors in pulp processes, the aim 
is to separate the organic and the inorganic parts of the 
dry substance of the waste liquor from each other. The 
heat from the organic part of the dry substance is recovered 
and the largest possible amount of steam is produced by 
means of this heat. Pulping chemicals are recovered from 
the inorganic part of the dry substance in such a form 
that they can, in subsequent stages of processing, be 
converted into a suitable form to be reused in the cooking 
process. The soda recovery boiler has, until now, proved to be 
superior for the recovery of heat and chemicals from waste 
liquors. The waste liquor is sprayed in the form of small 
drops into the boiler. In the hot combustion chamber water 
vapor, volatile parts of the dry substance, and eventually 
gasifiable parts of the dry substance evaporate from the 
drops. The gases inflame, thereby delivering heat to the 
heat surfaces disposed in the boiler and are discharged from 
the upper end of the boiler. The ash from the waste liquor 
drops, i.e. the inorganic substances of the waste liquor, 
accumulate on the bottom of the boiler, from which they 
are removed and through various stages of processing are 
conveyed back to the cooking process.  
 The flue gases from the soda recovery boiler contain a 
great deal of ash, mainly sodium sulfate, a portion of which 
flows along with the flue gases upwards in the boiler in 
the form of fine dust or molten drops. The salts contained 
in the ash melt at a relatively low temperature and become, 
when melting, easily adhesive and corrosive. The deposits 
formed by the molten ash cause the risk of clogging of the 
flue gas channels and, furthermore, cause corrosion and 
erosion of the heat surfaces of the boiler. The risk of 
clogging and corrosion increases considerably the number 
of the shutdowns for inspection and maintenance. Salt corrodes metal, particularly if the salt is molten or 
partly molten. A high temperature of the boiler tubes 
speeds up the formation of deposits and thereby the 
corrosion of the
