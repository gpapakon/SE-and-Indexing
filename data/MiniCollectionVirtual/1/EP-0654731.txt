<ABSTRACT>
A multiplier has an arithmetic unit for 
multiplying an N-bit multiplicand stored in a second 

register by an M-bit multiplicator stored in a first 
register according to the Booth's algorithm, and a third 

register for holding a result or product produced by the 
arithmetic unit. The first, second, and third registers, 

and the arithmetic unit are disposed on one substrate 
surface. The third register is disposed between the 

arithmetic unit and the second register. The second 
register is disposed between the third register and a 

fourth register. The result or product is transferred 
from the third register directly to the second register or 

the fourth register, and given as a multiplicand 
repeatedly to the second register to repeat a 

multiplication. Since the second and third registers are 
disposed adjacent to each other, wires required for giving 

the multiplicand repeatedly to the second register are 
made shorter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiplier
composed of an integrated semiconductor circuit, and more
particularly to a multiplier for multiplying a
multiplicand repeatedly by a multiplicator.FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows in
block form a multiplier for multiplying an N-bit
multiplicand repeatedly by an M-bit multiplicator. As
shown in FIG. 1, the multiplier comprises a first register
51 for temporarily storing the M-bit multiplicator, a
second register 52 for temporarily storing the N-bit
multiplicand, an arithmetic unit 60 supplied with output
signals from the first and second registers 51, 52 for
generating a plurality of partial products and adding the
partial products, and a third register 53 for temporarily
storing an output signal from the arithmetic unit 60 as a
product.FIG. 2 of the accompanying drawings shows a specific
arrangement of the multiplier shown in FIG. 1. Such
a multiplier circuit arrangement is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-open No. Showa JP-A-55-105732. The first and 
second registers 51, 52 are supplied with an 8-bit multiplicator
A1, A2, ∼, A8 and an 8-bit multiplicand B1, B2,
∼, B8. The arithmetic unit 60 comprises a Booth's encoder
54, a rectangular matrix of Booth's selector/adders 55,
and a carry select adder 56. The arithmetic unit 60 is
supplied with the multiplicator A1, A2, ∼, A8 and the
multiplicand B1, B2, ∼, B8, and multiplies the multiplicand
by the multiplicator according to the Booth's algorithm.The Booth's encoder 54 is composed of a
plurality of encoders 54a for outputting a code
corresponding to the multiplicator supplied from the first
register 51. The Booth's selector/adders 55 select a
multiplicand which will become a partial product, based on
the code outputted by the Booth's encoder 54, and add a
partial product from the Booth's selector/adders 55 in a
row positioned thereabove in FIG. 2. The third register
53 receives the result from the arithmetic unit 60, and
outputs a product C1, C2,∼, C8. In the multiplier,
therefore, the Booth's encoder 54 outputs information
(code) for generating partial products based on the
Booth's algorithm, the output signal from the Booth's
encoder 54 is supplied to the Booth's selectors to
generate partial products, and the partial products are
added according to the carry/save process at the same time
that the partial products are generated. In FIG. 2, a ground potential GD corresponds to
a logic level 0 and a power supply potential VD corresponds
to a logic level 1. The multiplier shown in FIG. 2
employs the
