<ABSTRACT>
Certain tetraarylethylenes reverse drug resistance in multi-drug resistant tumors. These compounds apparently function by inhibiting a p-glycoprotein pump which becomes activated in late stage tumor development and which is inherently present in tumors from certain origins.

<DESCRIPTION>
Effective tumor treatment is frequently thwarted by the 
lack of sensitivity of certain tumors to standard 
chemotherapeutic agents (intrinsic resistance) or by the 
ability of certain tumors to develop a lack of 
chemotherapeutic sensitivity during the course of treatment 
(acquired or extrinsic resistance). The cause of this 
phenomena has been linked to the existence of an energy-dependent 
efflux pump which acts to remove the 
chemotherapeutic agent from the target cell. The pump 
consists of the P-glycoprotein found as a constituent of 
cell membrane, and it has been suggested that the normal 
function of the P-glycoprotein is to remove toxins from 
within the cell. This theory is supported by the 
observation that P-glycoprotein is found as a cell membrane 
constituent in cells such as liver, kidney, colon, and 
jejunum. It has been suggested that P-glycoprotein in the 
cell membrane of such normal tissues could act to remove 
toxins or to assist in the transport of nutrients and 
solutes and in secreting a variety of protein and steroid 
substances. Natural presence of P-glycoprotein in tumor 
cells derived from these tissues as well as its presence in 
tumor cells derived from other tissue types could explain, 
at least in part, resistance of various tumors to therapy 
with standard chemotherapeutic agents.  
 The use of therapeutic agents which inactivate the P-glycoprotein 
pump would be invaluable in the treatment of 
multidrug resistant tumors. Compounds of formula 1 
 
   wherein Ar is a 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridyl group or a group 
of the formula 
 
   wherein Am is a di(C1-4alkyl)substituted amino group or 
is a heterocyclic ring selected from morpholino,  
 
   pyrrolidino, 
piperazino, N-(C1-4alkyl)piperazino, and 
piperidino, and wherein x in an integer of from 1 to 4, 
   and wherein R1, R2, and R3 are each independently 
selected from hydrogen, chloro, bromo, cyano, and 
methoxy or an acid addition salt thereof 
reverse multidrug resistance in multidrug resistant tumor 
cells and are thus useful adjuvants in the treatment of 
tumors. This invention concerns the use of the compounds of 
Formula 1 as agents for the preparation of medicaments 
effective in reversing drug resistance 
in multi-drug resistant tumors. The compounds of formula 1 
can be administered together with standard chemotherapeutic 
agents, can be used in the treatment of tumors which are 
intrinsically or extrinsically multi-drug resistant, and 
con be used to reverse resistance in experimental multi-drug 
resistant tumor
