<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved high-capacity 
getter pump, suitable for creating and 
maintaining the vacuum, for instance in an ultra-high 
vacuum chamber or in a high-energy particle accelerator. Getter pumps are well known in the art and are 
suitable for creating and maintaining vacuum. The first 
commercially successful getter pump, described in US 
patent 3,780,501, was employing, in a housing, a pleated 
metal strip having a getter metal embedded therein. 
Additional examples of such getter pumps were described 
in US patents 3,609,064; 3,662,522; 3,961,897 and 
4,137,012. Although these former getter pumps enjoyed a 
wide commercial success and market acceptance, they were 
still suffering from a drawback, residing in a limited 
sorption capacity inside a given volume. In order to increase said sorption capacity, it was 
suggested to simply fill the pump housing with a getter 
material in the form of compressed pellets, having size 
and shape similar to the tablets used in the field of 
drugs; such pellets were typically showing a cylindrical 
shape, with a diameter of 5-10 mm and a height of 2-10 
mm. However, when the housing is filled with such 
pellets, the access of the gas to the bulky getter  
 
structure is far from being satisfactory. Another 
drawback, bound to the use of said pellets, was their 
tendency to produce undesired loose particles; moreover 
the bulky structure can show safety problems because of 
the possibility of a high exothermicity of the getter 
material, during possible ignitions, and this is true 
in particular when the used getter material has a low 
activation temperature. GB-A-2 077 487 discloses a gettering structure as 
well as a method for manufacturing evacuated vessels by 
means of such a gettering structure. Accordingly, it is a first object of the present 
invention to provide an improved getter pump 
substantially free from one or more of the drawbacks 
hereinabove. Another object of the invention is to provide an 
improved getter pump having a higher sorption rate per 
unit volume, with respect to the getter pumps of the 
prior art. A further object of the invention is to provide an 
improved getter pump having a higher sorption capacity 
per unit volume, with respect to the getter pumps of 
the prior art. An additional object of the invention is to 
provide an improved getter pump resorting neither to 
pleated coated strips nor to pellets of getter 
material.  
 Other objects of the invention will be apparent to 
those of ordinary skill in

A high-capacity getter pump (10), suitable 
for creating and maintaining vacuum, comprising a 

plurality of porous sintered piled-up annuli (16-20) made from a 
non-evaporable getter material and having: 


i) a first planar surface (22) having a central hole; 
ii) a second planar surface (24), having a broader central 
hole, with respect to said first surface 

parallel to said first surface and 
spaced therefrom by a distance "d" of about 1-10.5 

mm. 
iii) a third intermediate planar surface (26) 
parallel to said first and second surfaces, 

interposed between said first and second surfaces,

alone or in admixture with other materials, like for 
instance antisintering agents.
