<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic relief device for a mounted implement, especially for a snow plough mountable on a carrier vehicle, acts via a hydraulic cylinder (11), via which a relief pressure is generated, in which, in the event of a deviation from a pressure desired value capable of being set in a relief device, the actual value of the prevailing pressure can be returned to the set pressure desired value. In order to provide an improved relief device, in which the circulated hydraulic medium is heated as little as possible, the following measures are provided:   - a pressure accumulator (25) chargeable by the use of the hydraulic medium via the hydraulic circuit provided on the motor vehicle is provided,   - a change-over valve arrangement (17) is provided, - in the relief mode, when the relief-pressure desired value is reached in the pressure accumulator (25) and/or in the pressure space (13) of the hydraulic cylinder (11) serving for relief, the change-over valve arrangement (17) can be changed over into a relief switching position (13) in such a way that the hydraulic circuit located on the motor vehicle is separated from the relief circuit and the pressure accumulation (25) is connected to the pressure space (13) of the hydraulic cylinder (11) intended for pressure relief.
