<ABSTRACT>
Lighting installation (illumination device) for rooms, in particular for offices, having at least one upwardly radiating projecting luminaire (7), at least one light-deflecting element (8), arranged in the region of the ceiling (2) of the room, for the downward deflection of the light projected upwards by the projection luminaire(s) (7), and having at least one additional luminaire (9) which floodlights (illuminates) the ceiling (2) of the room beside the light-deflecting element(s) (8).

<CLAIMS>
A lighting arrangement for rooms, in particular for office rooms, 
with at least one upwardly shining projector lamp (7) and at least one 

light deflection element (8) arranged in the region of the room ceiling (2) 
for deflecting downwardly the light which is projected upwardly by the 

projector lamp or lamps (7), characterised by at least one separate 
additional lamp (9) which is arranged in the upper half of the room and 

which shines on the room ceiling (2) over a large area beside the light 
deflection element or elements (8), wherein the projector lamp or lamps (7) 

and the light deflection element or elements (8) are arranged in such a way 
that substantially the whole light intensity of the projector lamp or lamps 

(7) strikes the light deflection element or elements (8). 
A lighting arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the additional lamp or lamps (9) shines or shine on substantially only the 

room ceiling (2). 
A lighting arrangement according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the additional lamp or lamps is arranged on or in the 

room wall (3). 
A lighting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the additional lamp or lamps (9) is or are fitted 

into the room wall (3). 
A lighting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the additional lamp or lamps (9) on the one hand and 

the projector lamp or lamps (7) on the other hand are arranged at opposite 
ends (3, 4) of the room, wherein the light deflection element or elements 

(8) are preferably closer to the associated projector lamp than the 
additional lamp.  

 
A lighting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that the projector lamp or lamps (7) are arranged in the 

region of a window breast (4a) beneath the windows. 
A lighting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that the additional lamp or lamps (9) and/or the projector 

lamp or lamps (7) have substantially punctiform light sources, preferably 
mercury vapour lamps or halogen incandescent lamps. 
A lighting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised in that at least a part of the projector lamps (7) have an 

apertured mask disposed in front of same. 
A lighting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 8 
characterised in that at least a part of the light deflection elements (8) 

respectively have a plurality of individual reflectors (8a-8d). 
Use of a lighting arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 9 
for rooms with at least one work surface which is accessible from a front 

side, preferably a desk, characterised in that the projector lamp or lamps 
and the deflection element or elements are arranged in such a way that the 

light passes on to the work surface through a notional vertical surface 
containing the front side of the work surface.
