A device for the pyrotechnic rotary drive of a winding shaft of 
an automatic safetybelt retractor of a vehicle about the winding shaft 

axis in the direction of winding a safetybelt onto the winding shaft, 
wherein the device has at least one drive body (5) arranged in a guide 

housing (1) and having a drive means (7), and at least one firing 
device, and the drive body (5) is rotatably drivingly connected to the 

winding shaft (2) when the drive means (7) is triggered, characterised 
in that the guide housing (1) has two or more guide tubes (4) whose 

longitudinal axes are arranged at a right angle to the winding shaft 
axis and in each of which is guided a respective drive body (5) with 

associated drive means (7), and that the respective drive means (7) for 
the drive bodies (5) can be triggered in time-staggered manner. 
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that when the 
drive means (7) is triggered the drive body (5) is in motion-transmitting 

contact with a driven wheel (3; 26) for applying a rotary 
movement to the winding shaft (2). 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that 
the guide housing (1) has two parallel guide tubes (4), between which 

the winding shaft axis is arranged. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that 
the respective guide tube (4) is of a curved shape or a circular shape. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that 
the drive bodies (5) are arranged in the guide tubes (4) in such a way 

that upon triggering thereof they are in contact with the winding shaft 
(2) for transmitting rotary motion in the same direction.  

 
A device according to claim 2 characterised in that the driven 
wheel (3) is in the form of a gear. 
A device according to one of claims 2 to 6 characterised in that 
when the drive body (5) is triggered the driven wheel (3; 26) is in 

engagement with the wall of the drive body (5), such engagement being 
self-cutting for the co-operating profile. 
A device according to one of claims 2 to 7 characterised in that 
the drive body has an external tooth configuration which upon triggering 

comes into engagement with the driven wheel (3; 26) which is in the form 
of a gear. 
A device according to one of claims 2 to 8 characterised in that 
the drive body (5) has an entry or centering cone (11) at its side 

towards the driven wheel (3; 26). 
A device according to one of claims 2 to 9 characterised in that 
the driven wheel (3; 26) is connected directly to the winding shaft (2). 
A device according to one of claims 2 to 10 characterised in 
that the driven wheel (3; 26) is connected to the winding shaft (2) by 

way of a transmission or another coupling means. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in 
that the drive means (7) is a pyrotechnically produced pressure gas. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in 
that the drive body (5) has a sleeve-shaped gas generator housing and in 

its bottom a firing fuse (8) which is connected to a firing line (10) 
connected in the guide housing (1) by way of a plug connection.  

 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 13 characterised in 
that the guide tube (4) and the drive body (5) are rotationally 

symmetrically round in cross-section which is perpendicular to their 
longitudinal axis. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in 
that the guide tube (4) and the drive body (5) are square, rectangular 

or polygonal in cross-section perpendicular to their longitudinal axis. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 15 characterised in 
that the guide tube (4) has an opening (13) of adjustable diameter in 

the closure wall (12) of its second end. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 16 characterised in 
that the respective drive body (5) is out of a condition of driving 

connection to the winding shaft, at the end of its drive movement. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5 and 9 to 17 
characterised in that the driven wheel (26) is in the form of a worm 

gear. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 18 characterised in 
that the firing devices for successive firing in respect of time of the 

respective drive means (7) for the plurality of drive bodies (5) can be 
fired by pressure. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 19 characterised in 

that provided in a pressure chamber (31) is a pressure medium which is 
against the side of the drive body (5), which is opposite to the drive 

connection, and the drive body (5) is urged into the condition of 
driving connection with the winding shaft (2) by the pressure medium.  

 
A device according to claim 20 characterised in that the 
pressure medium is formed by the pyrotechnic drive means (7) which 

drives the drive body (5). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 21 characterised in 
that a spring (36) can be brought into engagement with the drive body 

(5) moved by the drive means (7), the spring bringing the drive body (5) 
out of a condition of driving connection with the winding shaft (2).
