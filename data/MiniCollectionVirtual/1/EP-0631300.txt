<ABSTRACT>
Closed tube methods have been employed to diffuse 
impurities selectively in a groups III - V semiconductor wafer. The 

closed tube methods are convenient for preventing the element of 
group V from dissociating out of the wafer surface by 

pressurizing the vapor pressure of the element of group V. Open 
tube methods failed in diffusing impurities without defects due to 

the fluctuation of the vapor pressure of the element of group V. 
Both methods have relied upon the vapor phase diffusion using a 

gas containing impurities. This invention adopts an open tube 
method of diffusing impurities in solid phase. This invention forms 

a suppression mask film having windows selectively on a wafer, and 
grows impurity-containing films on the windows by vapor phase 

reaction in an open reaction tube. The impurities diffuse from the 
impurity-containing films to the wafer substrate in solid phase. 

The impurity diffusion occurs either at the same time of the growth 

of the films or after the growth of the films at a different 
temperature. The compound semiconductor is covered with solid  

 
films during the impurity diffusion. This invention is immune from 

the difficulty of escape of elements of group V from the surface of 
a wafer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent 
Application No.177233/1993 filed June 23, 1993, which is 
incorporated herein by reference. This invention relates to a method of producing group 
III - V semiconductor devices, in particular, to a method of 
impurity diffusion. III - V semiconductor means GaAs, GaP, InP, 
InSb, etc. Impurity diffusion is a treatment introducing impurity 
atoms via a surface into a semiconductor by some excitation, for 
example, by heat, in order to convert the electronic conduction 
type of the semiconductor. P-type impurities or n-type impurities 
are converted into a gas and introduced into a semiconductor via 
the surface. Many kinds of p-type impurities and n-type impurities 
for III - V semiconductors are known . For example, a p-type 
region is made by diffusing zinc (Zn) in III - V semiconductors. Epitaxial growth can also form semiconductor layers 
including impurity atoms on a substrate. However, epitaxial growth  
 
makes a flat film including impurity atoms uniformly. The impurity 
diffusion can dope a once-grown crystal with impurity atoms and can 
dope the impurity in any arbitrary patterns on a crystal by 
lithography. The doping of impurity atoms by thermal diffusion has 
been well known in the technology of silicon semiconductor devices. 
In the case of silicon semiconductor, an SiO₂ film is used as an 
insulating, passivation film. This invention aims at an improvement 
of impurity diffusion not of Si but of III - V semiconductors. 
Besides the problem of the passivation film, III - V semiconductors 
have difficulties different from silicon. The object crystals in which impurities shall be doped 
are various types of crystals, for example, a wafer of InP, GaAS or 
GaP, or a film epitaxially grown on a wafer or on another film. The 
object crystal is now called a substrate in short. Thus the 
substrate on which impurities shall be diffused includes films 
besides a wafer. Selective diffusion means that impurities are 
doped only into restricted regions but not doped into other 
regions. Since the regions of impurity diffusion are previously 
determined in the face of the substrate, the diffusion is called 
"selective". Many textbooks on semiconductor explain about methods  
 
of selective impurity diffusion into a semiconductor crystal on 
fabrication. For example, "INTRODUCTION OF RECENT 
SEMICONDUCTORS", SEIBUNDOSHINKOSHA p.54-p.58 explains the prior 
methods of selective impurity diffusion. Impurities are diffused 
into an object crystal from
