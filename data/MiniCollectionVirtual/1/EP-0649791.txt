<ABSTRACT>
A method for shrinking a shrink-foil hood which is drawn over a goods stack and is fixed at its free orifice edge to the lower end of the goods stack and which is then loaded with hot air from outside and from the bottom upwards by means of a shrinkage frame movable in the vertical direction along the goods stack, the space enclosed by the shrink hood being put under overpressure in order to inflate the hood, the overpressure being maintained until the application of heat is ended, is to be improved so that the packaging operation can be accelerated and carried out with a greater saving of energy. This is achieved in that, first of all, hot air is blown onto the lower hood region by the shrinkage frame and heated air flowing off downwards is collected underneath the goods stack, this heated air subsequently being blown into the space enclosed by the shrink hood, and in that, after a quantity of hot air sufficient for inflating the hood has been emitted, the shrinkage frame, with heat continuously being emitted to the hood, is moved along the stack from the bottom upwards.
