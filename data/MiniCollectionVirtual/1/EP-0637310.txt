<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel water-soluble sugar retinoids (I) in which the sugar radical carries at least one sulfate group, and to their preparation and the use thereof as medicaments and in the cosmetic sector. In formula (I), X is a sugar radical attached to an oxygen atom, i.e. a mono-, di- or oligosaccharide which is sulfated at one or more than one OH group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel water-soluble sugar retinoids in which the sugar
radical carries at least one sulfate group, and to their preparation and the use thereof as
medicaments and in the cosmetic sector.Retinoic acid derivatives are commonly used in the field of dermatology. Thus
keratinising epithelial tissue can be converted by retinoic acid or derivatives thereof into
tissue of normally differentiated cells. The retinoids exert a protective action against
chemically, photochemically or virally induced carcinogenesis and assume protective
functions in cell division. Retinoic acid itself is water-insoluble and is therefore usually
converted into a water-soluble form for ease of handling.In US-A-4 457 918 it is stated that the water solubility of vitamin A (retinol) can be
improved by converting the terminal -CH2OH group into a group -CH2OR in which R is a
glycosidic residue containing 1-20 glycosidic units.Aromatic retinoids having a saccaride or aminosaccharide radical, and which are suitable
dermatalogical agents for use in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, are disclosed in
US-A-4 565 863. For toxicological reasons, such aromatic retinoids are sought to be
avoided.In WO-A-9014093 reference is made to US-A-4 457 918 and to the fact that the
compounds of US-A-4 457 918 have the disadvantage that they cause skin
irritation/dermatitis problems. This disadvantage is said to be overcome in
WO-A-9014093 by the use of a specific vitamin A derivative, namely retinoic acid
glucuronide.The document Internat.J.Vit.Nutr.Res., 1990, vol.61, p.258-263 describes the chemical
synthesis of retinoyl Î²-glucose and its growth-promoting activity and metabolism in
vitamin A-deficient rats. In a field completely distinct from that of retinoid chemistry, US-A-5 091 371 discloses a
new antibiotic, namely benanomycin A 4'''-O-sulfate and salts thereof. These
microbiologically produced antibiotics contain aromatic groups which are sought to be
avoided on retinoids for toxicological reasons.Accordingly, the invention relates to water-soluble aliphatic derivatives of retinoic acid.
These novel retinoids are retinoic acid esters of formula (I)

wherein X is a sugar residue attached at an oxygen atom, i.e. a mono-, di- or
oligosaccharide which is sulfated at one or more than one OH group.The double bonds in the retinoic acid radical may be in cis- or trans-configuration, the
all-trans-form being preferred. Oligosaccharides containing more than two sugar units may suitably be in particular
compounds such as
