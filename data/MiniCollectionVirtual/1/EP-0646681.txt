<ABSTRACT>
The waterproof sealing of a joint between two abutting concrete members formed 
sequentially by pouring fluid concrete mix into formwork is achieved by 


(a) placing a waterstop hose (5) on the formwork (4) which will 
define one face of the joint in a first-formed concrete member (1); 
(b) at least partially surrounding this hose with material which 
prevents the fluid 

concrete from contacting that part of the hose which is adjacent to the formwork; 
(c) removing the formwork; 
(d) forming a second concrete member abutting against the first-formed member, 
thus providing the other face of the joint; and 
(e) pumping through the waterstop hose a sealing composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of providing a waterproof joint between two 
sequentially-formed concrete members. When concrete members such as slabs are formed sequentially by pouring fluid 
concrete into formwork, a joint is inevitably created between a first concrete member 
and a second, subsequently-formed concrete member. This joint is often not 
watertight, especially when the second member is formed under the first member, 
and this can lead to water leakage problems. One attempt to solve this problem has 
been the attachment of waterstop hose to the first-formed member at that surface 
against which the second member will be formed and which will therefore form one 
face of the joint. Through such a hose, an appropriate sealing composition may be 
pumped. However, such solutions to the problem have hitherto proved 
unsatisfactory because the almost complete surrounding of the hose by the second 
member has not permitted the achievement of good sealing. It has now been found that good sealing may be achieved by an arrangement as 
hereinunder described. The invention therefore provides a method of providing a 
waterproof joint between a formed first concrete member and a subsequently-formed 
second concrete member, comprising the steps of 
(a) providing formwork for the creation of a first concrete member, (b) pouring fluid concrete into the formwork and allowing it to harden to form 
a first concrete member; (c) removing the formwork; (d) forming a second concrete member by pouring fluid concrete into 
formwork, such that said second concrete member abuts against said first 
concrete member to form a joint; and (e) supplying a sealing composition to seal the joint by means of a waterstop 
hose located at the joint; characterised in that, prior to the formation of the first member, the hose is placed 
on that part of the formwork which will define one face of the eventual joint with the 
second concrete member, the hose extending the entire length of the eventual joint 
and being at least partially surrounded along this length by material which contacts 
the formwork on both sides of the hose along this entire length and which is 
adapted to prevent fluid concrete poured into the formwork from contacting that part 
of the hose which lies adjacent to the formwork. Waterstop hose is a commodity well known to and widely used by the art, and the 
hose used in the method of this invention may be selected from any of the 
commercial materials known to the art. It is typically a hose of a rigid

placed on that part of the formwork which will define one face of the eventual 
joint with the second concrete member, the hose extending the entire length 

of the eventual joint and being at least partially surrounded along this length

entire length and which is adapted to prevent fluid concrete poured into the 
formwork from contacting that part of the hose which lies adjacent to the 

formwork. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the material comprises strips of 
material impermeable to concrete affixed to the formwork on both sides of the 

hose, the strips having a thickness slightly less than the diameter of the hose. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the material comprises an elongate 
strip of resilient material, having a flat underside capable of attachment to 

formwork and bearing on its reverse surface an elongate slot which is adapted 
partially to surround and hold in place a waterstop hose 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the material comprises a completely 
surrounding layer of a mortar which is permeable to sealing compound which 

is to be pumped through the hose, but which is impermeable to concrete. 
A waterproof joint between two adjacent concrete members, which joint 
comprises a cavity spanning the length of the joint and filled with a sealing 

composition.
