<ABSTRACT>
A closure (10) comprising a ferrous metal easy open 
food can end has a retention device (40) which engages 

the rear portion (38) of a ring-pull tab (30). The 
retention device (40) has a ledge (46) on which the tab 

sits and a hooked nipple (48) which passes around the 
inside of the ring-pull. The central panel (20) of the 

closure is recessed, particularly under the rear portion 
(38) of the tab, around the retention device (40). During 

processing of a container to which the closure is fixed, 
pressure building up inside the container causes the 

recessed parts (24, 25, 26) to flex outwardly, thus 
pushing the retention device (40) into further locking 

engagement with the tab (30). The tab is thus prevented 
from lifting and/or rotating during the processing 

procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a closure. In particular, 
but not exclusively, it relates to an end of substantially 
ferrous metal or a laminate of ferrous metal and polymeric 
material suitable for closing a container such as a can 
for various types of food. Such a closure generally comprises a so-called "full-aperture 
easy open end" or a "partial aperture easy open 
end" to which a tab or ring is fixed and can be lifted in 
order to break a score around the periphery of the end so 
as completely to remove a central panel or a portion of 
the end for a partial aperture end, thereby obtaining 
access to food within the container to which the end is 
fixed. Food containers are generally thermally processed in 
cookers such as a hydrostat, reel and spiral or static 
cookers. Around 40% of food processing operations use the 
reel and spiral procedure in which containers pass from 
one spiral to the next by means of a transfer valve. 
Typically, approximately 1000 cans per minute spiral 
round within a drum for about 20 minutes until they reach 
the end of the spiral at which point the transfer valve 
passes them to the next spiral. The transfer valve 
includes a flat plate against which the closure presses 
during the transfer. When the container becomes 
pressurised during processing there is a risk that the 
closure may bulge and lift the tab which then catches on 
the transfer plate thus compromising the integrity of the 
closure. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a closure of substantially ferrous metal or a laminate of 
ferrous metal and polymeric material, the closure 
comprising an outer rim; a central panel connected to the 
rim and including a score; and a tab fixed to the central 
panel adjacent to the score and having a nose portion for 
breaking the score when a rear portion of the tab is 
raised; in which the central panel includes a retention  
 
device for engaging the tab and which is located in a 
recess under the rear portion of the tab whereby flexing 
of the panel is controlled and maintains engagement of the 
retention device with the tab. The recessed portion of the central panel enables the 
panel to flex in a controlled manner during processing as 
the internal pressure of the container increases. The 
retention device moves with the recessed portion as it 
flexes and thereby moves into further locking engagement 
with the tab. Further control of the flexing of the closure may be 
achieved by the provision of peripheral ridges or C-shaped 
formations which make

<CLAIMS>
A closure of substantially ferrous metal or a 
laminate of ferrous metal and a polymeric material, the 

closure comprising: 
   an outer rim; 

   a central panel connected to the rim and including a 
score; and 

   a tab fixed to the central panel adjacent to the score 
and having a nose portion for breaking the score when a 

rear portion of the tab is raised; 
   and in which the central panel includes a retention 

device for engaging the tab, the retention device being 
located in a recess under the rear portion of the tab; 

whereby flexing of the panel is controlled and maintains 
engagement of the retention device with the tab. 
A closure according to claim 1, in which the 
retention device includes a ledge on which the tab rests. 
A closure according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which 
the retention device includes a hook which engages the 

tab. 
A closure according to claim 1 or claim 3, in which 
the retention device is positioned along the radius 

through the point at which the tab is fixed to the central 
panel. 
A method of forming a closure of substantially 
ferrous metal or a laminate of ferrous metal and polymeric 

material for food containers which are internally 
pressurised during processing, the method comprising: 

   providing an end wall having outer rim and a central 
panel connected to the rim and including a score; 

   fixing a tab to the central panel adjacent to the 
score so that a rear portion of the tab extends towards 

the centre of the closure; and 
   providing a recess in the central panel under the 

rear portion of the tab and a raised dimple in the recess 
 

which engages the rear portion of the tab, whereby flexing 
of the central panel maintains engagement of the dimple 

with the tab. 
A method according to claim 5, further comprising: 
   forming a nipple at or adjacent to the centre of the 

closure; 
   forming the raised dimple around the nipple so that 

the nipple projects from the raised dimple; 
   crushing the nipple towards the centre to form a 

hook; 
   fixing the tab to the central panel by a rivet 

adjacent to the score and along the same radius as the 
nipple; and 

   engaging the hooked nipple with the rear portion of 
the tab. 
A method according to claim 5 or claim 6, further 
comprising depressing a part of the dimple so as to 

provide a ledge. 
A closure substantially as hereinbefore described, 
with reference to the drawings. 
A method substantially as hereinbefore described, 
with reference to the drawings.
