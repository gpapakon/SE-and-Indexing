<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a beam (1) for vehicle frames, in particular as a chassis beam (longeron, side member) and drawbar strut, having a C-shaped profile, the vertical web (3) of which continuously increases from the ends to the cross-section, which is subject to the maximum load, of the beam (1) and which is welded in the region of its lower flange formed by a profiled limb (5). In order further to develop a beam (1) of the type described at the beginning which is intended for use in vehicle frames, in such a manner that despite the welding in the lower flange the beam (1) does not have to be overdimensioned because of the welding factor, with the invention it is proposed that the parts (5a, 5b) of the lower profiled limb (5) be welded to each other via a V-shaped insert (6).
