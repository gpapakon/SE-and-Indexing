<ABSTRACT>
A disposable mask (11) that includes a filter body (14) 
capable of filtering particles of a size appropriate for 

its purposes, while providing excellent breathability. 
An optically clear visor (90) may be attached to opposite ends 

of the filter body to protect a wearer's eyes and face 
from liquid splash or spray. The filter body (14) is formed 

from multiple layers of filtration material having the 
general configuration of a trapezoid. A darkened strip 

of material (28) may be disposed on the exterior of the filter 
body (14) adjacent to the visor (90) to reduce glare and 

reflections by the visor. The mask (11) is secured by straps (16,18) 
to the head of a wearer. The straps are arranged to be 

approximately coextensive with a line extending from the 
edges which define the opening of the mask so that the 

edges are pulled into tight sealing engagement with the 
face of the wearer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a face mask
capable of preventing passage of airborne aerosol
particles. More particularly, and not by way of
limitation, this invention relates to a disposable face
mask having a relatively low pressure drop to permit easy
breathing, while preventing aerosol particles from
passing therethrough and therearound. A visor or shield
may be attached to the mask to prevent liquids from
contacting the eyes of a wearer. Disposable masks have been manufactured for many
years. In the medical field, most of these masks have
been for use in preventing contamination of a patient by
the breath of health care personnel. In recent years
with increased concern for infection of health care
personnel with airborne pathogens, such as the hepatitis
B virus, it has become necessary to prevent not only the
contamination of patients due to exhalation from health
care personnel, but also to prevent infection of health
care personnel due to inhalation of airborne infection
particles. It has become even more important in view of
the advent of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the
recent increase in infectious tuberculosis associated
with many HIV patients.In addition, it has been found that aerosols having
airborne liquid and solid particles are generated not
only by the exhalation of infected patients, but also by
certain procedural manipulations and processes that
impart energy to any microbial suspension. Surgical
procedures involving use of drills and saws are
particularly prolific producers of the aerosols which may
contain tuberculosis, HIV or other pathogens from an
infected patient. Concern with tuberculosis has been
increasing since new strains of the disease show strong
resistances to multiple types of drug treatment.In addition, it has been shown that many of the
viral hemorrhagic fevers such as yellow fever, Rift
Valley fever and perhaps Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
rabies and smallpox can be transmitted through aerosols.
A considerable number of studies have been made which are
now beginning to identify the transmission of such
viruses through "non-accident" situations. Accordingly,
it is now believed that many of those "non-accident"
situations result from aerosol contamination. Of the current medical masks on the market, it
appears that many are not effective against aerosols.
One of the presently available molded-type surgical masks
has almost no resistance to particles smaller than two
(2) microns and has a low efficiency in blocking
particles as large as nine (9)
