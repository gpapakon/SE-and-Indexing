<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to conjugates of poorly immunogenic antigens, e.g. peptides, proteins and polysaccharides, with a synthetic peptide carrier constituting a T cell epitope derived from the sequence of human heat shock protein hsp65, or an analog thereof, said peptide or analog being capable of increasing substantially the immunogenicity of the poorly immunogenic antigen. Suitable peptides according to the invention are Pep278h, which corresponds to positions 458-474 of human hsp65, and Pep II, which corresponds to positions 437-448 of human hsp65, but in which two cysteine residues at positions 442 and 447 are replaced serine residues.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conjugates of enhanced
immunogenicity based on synthetic peptide carriers constituting
T cell epitopes, to their preparation and to vaccines suitable
for immunization comprising said conjugates.Antibody responses have been subclassified into two main
types on the basis of their requirement for T cells. The
primary humoral immune response to T cell-dependent (T-dep)
antigens is characterized by B and T cell activation and
proliferation leading on one hand to the differentiation of
plasma cells and immunoglobulin secretion, and on the other
hand to the formation of germinal centers and immunological
memory. Upon restimulation by antigen, these memory cells play
the leading part in the secondary antibody response. The
cardinal characteristics of the secondary response to T-dep
antigens are rapidity of antibody production, greater magnitude
of response as compared to the primary response, and an
immunoglobulin class switch from IgM to IgG.There are, however, a small number of antigens capable of
activating B cells independently from T cell help referred to
as T cell-independent (T-ind) antigens. They include among
others bacterial capsular polysaccharides, like the capsular
polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae, polymerized
Salmonella flagellin, poly-D-amino acids and the E. coli
lipopolysaccharide. T-ind antigens are characteristically of
high molecular weight, with a repeating structure, and in most
instances, are slowly degraded. They persist for long periods
on the surface of specialized macrophages and can bind to
antigen-specific B cells with great avidity through their 
multivalent attachment to the complementary immunoglobulin
receptors which they crosslink. At high enough concentration,
they have the ability to polyclonally activate a substantial
proportion of the B cell pool, i.e. without reference to the
antigen specificity of the surface receptor hypervariable
region. In general, the T-ind antigens give rise to
predominantly IgM responses, some IgG3 in the mouse, and
relatively poor, if any, memory.Capsulated bacteria such as Haemophilus influenza type b,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, group B
Streptococci, and E. coli type K1, cause serious invasive
diseases in humans, especially in infants and in
immunocompromised individuals. Plasma anti-polysaccharide
antibodies have been shown to be protective against invasive
diseases caused by most of these pathogens and vaccines
consisting of purified capsular polysaccharides (CPS) have been
develop
