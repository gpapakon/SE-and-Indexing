<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of enquiring for an itinerary and guiding of vehicles using one or a plurality of positioning methods, an electronically stored road system in the form of individual road segments in a centre and an itinerary planning and/or optimal module installed in said centre. The method is characterised in that a mobile communication system comprising a mobile radio network and mobile radio terminals is used; an itinerary is planned in the centre in response to user enquiry, said itinerary being planned according to optimum criteria of the enquiry and/or the vehicle and/or the individual user; a guidance root is generated in the centre, and a chain and sequence (peculiar to each individual itinerary) of road segments is included as important information therein; an individual itinerary is produced in the centre on the basis of the guidance root and additional information and is transmitted to the terminal where it is processed in an essentially independent manner.

Method for route enquiry and guidance to destination in vehicles using one or more navigation methods, a network of roads electronically stored in the form of individual segments of roads in a control centre and a route planning and/or optimisation module located in the control centre, wherein a mobile communications system composed of a mobile communications network and mobile communications terminal devices for data transmission between the vehicle and the control centre is used so that at user request - specifying a destination address - route planning takes place in the control centre, wherein route planning ensues in accordance with optimisation criteria specific to the enquiry and/or vehicle and/or user, wherein the starting position of the vehicle determined by the navigation system is transmitted to the control centre and the control centre generates an individual route description which is transmitted to the terminal device where it is worked through largely autonomously, 
characterised in that
 in the control centre a destination guidance matrix is generated by assigning the starting position of the vehicle to a catchment area, wherein on the basis of specified criteria all catchment points contained in this catchment area are determined and proceeding from the catchment point(s) determined a road segment sequence is calculated in each case for each possible route to a set-down point determined from the destination address 
in that
 the individual road segments are designated by reference numbers and chaining and sequencing of the road segments to form a destination guidance matrix via the reference numbers, wherein the individual route description is generated from the destination guidance matrix and additional items of information,
that attributes are assignable to the individual road points in the road segments which define road intersections, road branchings or the destination area (set-down point) located on the journey route determined and that a system of road guide symbols is used to describe and illustrate the road intersections, road branchings or destination area in which system the road intersections, road branchings or the destination area classified according to their various categories and characteristics are filed in coded form.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a road segment is defined by at least two road points.
Method according to any of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the coordinates of the road points are established with the aid of at least one reference point whose coordinates are precisely known.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the coordinates of the second road points of all road segments contained in this catchment area represent possible catchment points which are evaluated according to specified criteria in order to determine from this the coordinates of a desired catchment point.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the specified destination address is assigned to a defined destination area, wherein the coordinates of the first road points of all road segments contained in this destination area are evaluated according to specified criteria in order to determine from this the coordinates of a possible set-down point.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 a focal point is defined through which all calculated road segment sequences pass or at the latest meet there.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the possible road segment sequences determined are transmitted by the control centre to the terminal device where there ensues autonomous preparation of the data with a visual display or acoustic output of the journey route determined.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 to the individual road points of the road segments attributes are assignable which trigger visual or acoustic outputs for the user and/or initiate possible actions on the part of the terminal device.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 by evaluating the current or respective last positional data in the navigation system the rough direction of motion of the vehicle can be determined.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the specification of the desired destination ensues indirectly by inputting a dial number in a communications network into the terminal device, wherein the dial number entered is passed over to the control centre where the address associated with the entered dial number is determined.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 the specification of destination by means of dial numbers is assisted by the possibility of accessing an electronic telephone book filed in the control centre.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 for specifying the destination address access may be made to a dial number memory present in the terminal device so that dial numbers stored therein can be taken over directly by the destination guidance system.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that
 the desired dial number for specification of destination is determined by calling an auxiliary service (operator), wherein the dial number determined is passed over directly to the control centre for further processing.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that
 in the control centre a check is made of the unambiguousness and completeness of the data passed over by the terminal device or the auxiliary service.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that
 in the terminal device a visual display or an acoustic output of the destination address determined ensues.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 15, 
characterised in that
 in a user-specific dial number directory in the control centre starting positions and destination addresses which have been determined once can be stored for future reuse.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 16, 
characterised in that
 errors in journeys are recognised automatically and return to one of the road segment sequences determined is initiated or if need be directional guidance takes place solely on the basis of the data from the navigation system.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 17, 
characterised in that
 directional guidance of the vehicle - without participation of the control centre - is possible on the basis of the current vehicle position and travel direction determined and a nearest known position, in particular for finding the way from the starting position to the next catchment point, on departing from the specified route and for finding the destination after passing the set-down point up to the final destination.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 18, 
characterised in that
 a plurality of destination travel levels is provided, wherein the planned route determined for destination travel level = 0 and for all other possible routes of the destination guidance matrix deviating from the planned route corresponds to a destination travel level 
>
 0.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 19, 
characterised in that
 current traffic bulletins are continuously transmitted to the user on request.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 20, 
characterised in that
 the additional items of information contain information about the traffic situation, weather conditions, etc.
