<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cold cathodes, which are devices 
which, without external heating and on application of a relatively small 
voltage, emit electrons into a vacuum. The invention includes a method of 
preparation, and also new cold cathodes whose emission characteristics 
are improved, in some cases by an order of magnitude, over any silicon 
cathodes described in the literature. EP 0 508 737 A1 relates to prior art under Article 54(3) EPC and describes how microscale cold cathodes 
comprising a metallic emitter tip with a very sharp end are manufactured by 
a method comprising forming a cone of metal on a substrate, oxidising the 
surface of the cone and removing the oxidised film from the cone surface 
to produce an emitter tip. There are two main approaches to forming cold cathodes. 
One is by the production of negative electron affinity surfaces, and the 
other by forming material into small pyramids or columns, each with a very 
sharp point, on the surface of a wafer. This invention is concerned with the 
latter technique, the provision of sharp tips on a surface. In order to emit electrons by field emission, the cathode tips 
must be very sharp, particularly if low operational voltages are required. 
The electrons are attracted to an anode and a metal gate usually held 
0.1 µm to 0.5 µm away is normally used to switch the electron beam on 
and off. A diagram of a vacuum triode is shown in Figure 1 and illustrates 
one possible arrangement of a device. A field emitter is fabricated of metal 
or semiconductor 10, and includes a cathode tip 12. A metal gate 14 is 
held around the top of the cathode tip by an insulating layer 16 (of an 
oxide) and a metal anode 18 is held above the cathode by a further 
insulating layer 20. When a positive potential difference is applied 
between the base 10 and the gate 14, an electric field is generated at the 
tip 12 which allows electrons to tunnel from the cathode material to  
 
a vacuum 22. The field at the tip and so the number of 
electrons emitted are controlled by the gate potential. 
This basic unit is usually integrated into a very large 
array, for example as shown in Figure 2. This 
comprises a silicon base 24 having a profiled upper 
surface with silicon pyramids 26. An overlying layer 
of insulator 28 1 µm thick is itself overlain by a 
metal grid 30, both gated to reveal the pyramids. The 
pyramids are shown 10 µm apart, but the packing density 
of units into the array will depend on the particular 
application. The field emission triode
