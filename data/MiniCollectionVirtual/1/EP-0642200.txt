<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a safety unit for an electric 3-phase circuit for use 
in, for example, an electric motor. Said safety unit comprises three semi-conducting 

components (1, 2, 3) each of which has a first terminal (4, 6, 8) and a second terminal 
(5, 7, 9). The safety unit also comprises a support (10) having three contact pins (11, 

12, 13) as well as an insertive module (14). The components are secured to the support 
and electrically contact one of the contact pins (11, 12, 13) 
via
 the first terminals (4, 6, 
8). Desired electric interconnections between the terminals are established by means of 

the insertive module (14) 
via
 receptive apertures in the support. Such a safety unit 
exhibits a great sturdiness and a high electrical safety. In addition, the use of specially 

constructed insertive modules enables a "star" configuration to be converted into a 
"delta" configuration, and conversely, in a simple manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a safety unit for an electric 3-phase circuit, said 
safety unit comprising three semi-conducting components which are each provided with 
a first terminal and a second terminal. A unit of the above-mentioned type is used for protecting a 3-phase 
electric circuit against sudden voltage or current changes in, for example, electric 
motors or alternators, as well as for protecting the electrical mains in houses. For the 
semi-conducting component use can be made, inter alia, of diodes such as the so-called 
"break over diode" (B.O.D) which is used in telephony. However, for the semi-conducting 
component use is preferably made of a non-linear resistor in the form of a 
VDR (voltage-dependent resistor). In that case, the safety unit is used to compensate for 
the effects of changes in current intensity in a three-phase circuit. A safety unit of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is known per 
se. Said safety unit is an assembly of three VDRs, the second terminals being 
electrically interconnected by a soldered joint. The assembly is attached to the electric 
circuit of an electric motor via the first terminals and soldered-on current-supply wires. 
In this embodiment, the unit is constructed as a so-called "star configuration". A safety 
unit of the so-called "delta-configuration" type can be manufactured by connecting the 
(in total six) different terminals of the three resistors in a different manner. A disadvantage of the known safety unit is that the sturdiness of the 
construction is insufficient. In addition, the electrical safety of the known unit leaves 
much to be desired. In practice, it is very disadvantageous that a unit manufactured in 
the delta configuration can hardly, or perhaps not at all, be changed into the star 
configuration, or conversely. Consequently, the purchaser of the unit is tied to one of 
said two configurations. Also the fact that for the manufacture of said two different 
configurations, in fact, two different production processes are required is considered to 
be a drawback. It is an object of the invention to overcome the above-mentioned 
disadvantages and drawbacks. The invention more particularly aims at providing an  
 
electrically safe and sturdy safety unit. The invention further aims at providing a safety 
unit which can be converted from a delta configuration into a star configuration in a 
simple manner. These and other objects of the invention are achieved by a safety unit of 
the type mentioned in the opening paragraph,
