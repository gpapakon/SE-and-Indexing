<ABSTRACT>
A polymer blend is produced by simultaneously 
blending and shearing a low ethylene content ethylene-propylene 

polymer and a higher ethylene content 
ethylene-propylene polymer to reduce their molecular 

weights and molecular weight distributions and to 
yield a product than can be recovered as a solid using 

conventional plastics processing equipment. The 
sheared blend of polymers can function as a shear 

stable viscosity index improver with improved low 
temperature properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process to prepare ethylene-propylene polymers and,
more specifically, to a process to prepare blends of such polymers by
simultaneously blending and shearing the polymers to reduce
their molecular weights and molecular weight distribution. The
ethylene-propylene polymers obtained by the process of the present invention have
unique properties which enable them to be processed in conventional
plastic processing equipment.Ethylene-propylene polymers have long been known, and used
for a variety of applications. For example, such copolymers,
frequently referred to in the art as olefin copolymers or OCPs,
have long been recognized as viscosity index improvers in
engine lubricating oils. In addition to that application, such
polymers have also been widely used as impact modifiers for
plastic compositions.As used in lubricating oil compositions, ethylene-propylene
polymers have the ability to provide a high thickening
contribution to the lubricating oil composition with which the 
OCP is mixed to provide increases in the viscosity index of the
overall composition. Thickening power is often defined as the
difference in the kinematic viscosities of a dilute solution of
an OCP mixed with oil and the diluent oil. For example, an oil
solution containing from 1 to 2 percent of an OCP which
provides a thickening power of 6 to 7 centistokes measured at
100°C generally indicates acceptable viscosity index improvement
performance.For a given class of polymers, the higher the molecular
weight, the higher is the viscosity of a lubricating oil containing
the OCP. However, higher molecular weight polymers
exhibit a greater tendency to break down under the shear and
high temperature conditions normally found in engine operation,
frequently resulting in the loss of viscosity. Accordingly,
viscosity index improvement often depends on the balance
between the thickening contribution of the OCP and its tendency
to degrade, referred to as shear stability. Shear stability is
typically defined as a percent viscosity breakdown on shear
under a standard set of conditions. A value below 30 percent
viscosity breakdown in an OCP is generally an indication that
the viscosity index improver OCP is shear stable as that term
is understood in the art. Another important characteristic required for a viscosity
index improver is viscosity at low temperatures, which relates
to the ease of engine cranking during start-up in cold climates.
An ideal viscosity index improver exhibits a negligible
viscosity contribution at
