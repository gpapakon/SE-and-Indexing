<ABSTRACT>
The use of specific CaCO3 having an average particle size of 0.8 to 1.2  mu m and a BET surface area of 8-12 m
<
2
>
/g as pigment in recording layers with organic acceptor improves the recording intensity without impairing the printability of the surface of the recording sheet.

<CLAIMS>
A recording sheet for pressure-sensitive 
recording systems with a recording layer which is disposed 

on the upper aide of the sheet of paper and which contains 
organic acceptor, binding agent, pigments and/or fillers 

and CaCO
3
, characterised by the use of precipitated CaCO
3
 
with a mean particle size of 0.8 to 1.2 Âµm, a BET surface 

area of 8 to 12 m
2
/g and an oil absorption value according 
to DIN 53 199 of 40 to 60 g/100 g. 
A recording sheet according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the recording layer contains 3 % by 

weight to 10 % by weight of organic acceptor, 20 % by 
weight to 50 % by weight of the special CaCO
3
 and the 
remainder up to 100 % by weight of binding agent, further 

pigments and conventional additives, the percentage data 
relating to the weight of the recording layer.
