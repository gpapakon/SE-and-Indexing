<ABSTRACT>
A foamable composition, comprising a viscous 
liquid and a gas homogeneously dispersed in the liquid 

is described herein. The composition is prepared by 
blending a pressurized gas with the viscous liquid in a 

mixing chamber. The flow rate of the pressurized gas 
into the mixing chamber is controlled as a function of 

the flow rate (19) of at least one high-viscosity liquid 
into said chamber. Our apparatus for preparing our 

composition includes a means (4) for controlling the flow 

rate of the pressurized gas as a function of (1) either 
the difference in the feed pressures of said gas and 

said liquid, or (2) a predetermined ratio of the 
volumes of liquid and gas present in said mixing 

chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
obtaining a homogeneous dispersion of a pressurized gas 
in a high-viscosity liquid composition. It also 
relates to an associated apparatus for the controlled 
blending of a pressurized gas with a high viscosity 
liquid in a mixing chamber equipped with separate 
inlets for these two ingredients. The gas is 
distributed throughout the resultant foamed mixture as 
bubbles with a uniformly small size and distribution 
that are consistent as a function of time. The viscous 
liquid is preferably a curable organosiloxane 
composition. The prior art of this invention is presented 
in a commonly assigned and earlier published 
application, EP-A1 0 604 926, dated July 6, 1994. FR-A-1,505,772 discloses a process and an apparatus for 
continuously transforming a latex into a foam. In that 
process, a first signal/impulse from a latex feeding pump 
is directed to a counter/controller which in turn sends a 
second signal to an electrically actuated valve in a compressed 
gas stream to feed the gas into a mixing chamber. In DE-A1-38,18,760, a process for maintaining a constant 
mixing ratio of a large primary stream and a relatively 
small secondary stream is disclosed. In the process, the 
volume of the primary stream is measured and indicated by a 
first signal, and the duration of the supply of the secondary 
stream is measured and indicated by a second signal. 
The actual values of the said signals are continuously 
measured and compared with each other. The supply of the 
secondary stream is discontinued when the signal of the 
secondary stream equals or exceeds the signal of the primary 
stream, and the supply of the secondary stream is resumed 
when the signal of the secondary stream reaches its upper 
limit value.  
 During our investigation into the fabrication 
of homogeneous high-expansion-ratio foams, we have 
found that dispersing the small amount of inert gas 
which is blended into the viscous liquid is capable of 
yielding enhanced quality of the cell dispersion in the 
cured foam. Methods for mixing pressurized gases into 
high-viscosity liquids are known for the production of 
whipped cream and urethane foams. However, as shown in 
the data plots of the drawings, it is very difficult to 
obtain uniform gas-liquid mixtures when pressurized 
gases are blended into high-viscosity liquids. The present invention provided a method and 
an apparatus capable of producing uniform dispersions 
of a pressurized gas in a high-viscosity liquid. The
