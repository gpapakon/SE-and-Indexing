<ABSTRACT>
An ammonia gas sensor (16) is housed within a container (14) partially immersed in a solution (2) containing ammonium ions. An electrochemical generator (6, 8, 10) generates hydroxyl ions in a region of the solution (2) adjacent the container (14). This converts ammonium ions to ammonia gas which is sensed by the sensor (16) having passed through a gas-permeable member (12). This sensing provides an indication of the concentration of ammonium ions in the solution (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the 
concentration of ammonium ions in solution and has particular, although not exclusive, 
applicability to analysis of aqueous solutions such as contaminated water supplies and 
bodily fluids where ammonium ions may be produced by enzymatic action as for urea 
in blood. Techniques for sensing the concentration of ammonia in a gas phase, and in 
a gas phase above and in equilibrium with a solution containing dissolved ammonia 
are known. Such techniques may then be used to determine the concentration of 
ammonium ions in the solution by utilising the pH-dependent relationship which exists 
between the concentration of ammonium ions and ammonia in solution and the 
relationship which exists between ammonia gas and dissolved ammonia in equilibrium 
at the gas/liquid interface. It is known that by increasing the alkalinity of a solution 
containing ammonium ions, then ammonia may be generated within the solution. 
Increasing the alkalinity of such a solution may most conveniently be achieved by 
adding to the solution either alkali or buffer reagents such as sodium hydroxide or 
potassium hydroxide as disclosed in EP-A-339158. However, addition of such 
reagents to the solution may be undesirable because the use of consumables is 
inconvenient and may also cause unwanted hydrolysis of biochemical materials 
leading to an increase in ammonium ion and ammonia levels. Alternatively, the concentration of ammonium ions in solution may themselves 
be directly sensed by, for example, using an ammonium ion sensitive device within 
the solution. Both the above known techniques suffer from various shortcomings. The 
former, for example, because of the addition of alkali or buffer reagents. The latter, 
for example, because an ion sensitive device in the solution will have at least a degree 
of cross-sensitivity to Na+ or K+ ions as well as being predominantly sensitive to NH4+ 
ions. Similarly Na+ and K+ ion sensitive electrodes show a degree of cross-sensitivity 
to NH4+ ions. As a result of the mutual cross-sensitivity of these ion sensitive devices,  
 
an analysis based upon a combination of such electrodes may be unsatisfactory, 
especially for an ion only present at low concentrations. It is thus an object of the present invention to at least alleviate the 
aforementioned shortcomings by avoiding the need to add alkali or buffer reagents to 
the solution under test and also to avoid the need to sense the ion concentration in the 
solution
