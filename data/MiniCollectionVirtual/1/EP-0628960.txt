<ABSTRACT>
An optical information recording and/or 
reproducing apparatus includes a first light source (4) for 

recording or erasing information, a first current 
source (6) for modulating a light beam from the first light 

source in accordance with a recording signal, a second 
light source (5) for verification, and a second current 

source (7) for supplying a current to the second light 
source to make the second light source emit a 

reproducing light beam. The light beam from the first 
light source leads on an information track on an 

optical recording medium, and the light beam from the 
second light source follows on the information track. 

Based on reflected light from the optical recording 
medium, of the light beam from the second light source, 

information recorded by the light beam from the first 
light source is reproduced for verification. The 

apparatus further has an inductor (8) disposed in a current 
supply path from the second current source (7) to the 

second light source (5), which has an impedance 
sufficiently larger than an impedance of the second 

light source at a recording signal frequency, and a 
high-frequency oscillator (9) for modulating a light output 

from the second light source, which applies a 
high-frequency current with a frequency sufficient 

higher than the recording signal frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
information recording apparatus
which performs recording and verification at the same
time using a plurality of light sources.There are known recording and/or reproducing
apparatus for optically recording and/or reproducing
information, for example, magneto-optical disc
apparatus utilizing the interaction of heat and
magnetic field, and phase-change disc apparatus
utilizing the thermal action. These recording and/or
reproducing apparatus generally perform so-called
verification in order to enhance reliability, in which
immediately after recording of information, the
recorded information is reproduced and compared to
verify with the original recording information so as to
confirm whether or not the information was able to be
properly recorded. Further, various methods for
performing recording and verification simultaneously
are recently proposed in order to shorten the time for
verification. As such a method for performing
recording and verification simultaneously, a double 
beam method is known, in which, for example, one of two
light sources is used for recording and the other for
verification. Namely, a light beam from a recording
light source is irradiated in advance on a track of
recording medium to record information, and a light
beam from a verifying light source is scanned
thereafter to reproduce the recorded information based
on the reflected light from the track, whereby
recording and simultaneous verification, i.e., direct
verification is effected.Fig. 1 is a structural drawing to show the
scheme of an information recording and/or reproducing
apparatus employing the double beam verification system
as described above. In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1
denotes a magneto-optical disc, i.e., information
recording medium, and numeral 2 an electromagnet
provided above the upper surface of disc 1. An optical
system 3 (optical head) is provided under the magneto-optical
disc 1, in which a first semiconductor laser 4
is formed as a light source for recording information
and a second semiconductor laser 5 as light source for
verification. The first and second semiconductor
lasers 4 and 5 are arranged to be close to each other.
Optical beams from the lasers each are converged by an
objective lens (not shown) in the optical system 3, so
as to form images as recording and verifying light
spots juxtaposedly aligned on an information track on 
the magneto-optical disc 1. The light beam from the
first semiconductor laser 4 is irradiated in advance on
the information
