<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for vacuum attachment
of an object to a surface, such a skin area, especially a
device in the form of a suction electrode assembly, particularly
a suction electrode assembly for use in taking electrocardiograms
and in carrying out other biophysical examinations
and treatments.A vacuum attachment device of the kind contemplated here
is a device which is adapted to be held to a surface under
the action of a negative pressure in a vacuum chamber or
vacuum cup which is partly delimited by the surface. More
particularly, the negative pressure is applied to the vacuum
chamber by a vacuum source, such as a suction pump, which is
connected to the device.Devices of this kind are embodied in, for example,
suction electrode assemblies for use in electrocardiographic
and other biophysical examinations in which the surface to
which the suction electrode assembly is held is an area of
the skin of a patient or other individual. A requirement then
to be met is that an electrode which forms part of the electrode
assembly is held in good electrical contact with the
surface.Many different embodiments of suction electrode assemblies
are known. Examples of embodiments are disclosed in EP-US-A-4736749
(= B-0143761), US-A-4248243, DE-A-2548805, AT-C-248608, CH-A-301242.It is desirable for hygienic and other reasons that it is
easy to replace those parts of the electrode assembly which
in use of the assembly contact the skin or are contaminated
by sweat and other skin secretions or by the medium (electrolytic
gel) which is used to improve the electrical contact
between the electrode and the skin.This is because an effect of the negative pressure and
the capillary forces is a strong tendency for the contaminants
to penetrate into those regions of the electrode assembly
where the assembly is connected with the vacuum source
and with the electrical lead connecting the electrode with 
the electrical measuring equipment. The contaminants also
promote the growth of microorganisms.In practice, a replacement of the entire electrode device
after each examination is not realistic, because an electrode
device which is adapted to be attached by vacuum is rather
expensive. This is true especially when the electrode device
includes a valve between the vacuum port and the vacuum
chamber. This valve serves to disconnect the vacuum chamber
from the vacuum port when the electrode device is not applied
to the skin.In practice, therefore, the replacement in the first instance
must be limited to components which
