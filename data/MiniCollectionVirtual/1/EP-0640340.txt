<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition for 
accelerating healing of a wound. A wound is a kind of injuries to the body and includes 
incisions, wounds of gastrointestinal tracts, gastric ulcers, 
burns, detachment, lacerations, incision, pressure ulcers 
called decubitus or bed sore, erosion, and lesions of surface 
tissues due to infection. In particular, it is desirable to 
accelerate healing of a surgical wound by a positive and direct 
treatment without relying on spontaneous cure because a patient 
having undergone a surgical operation generally has 
considerably reduced physical strength. Further, bed sore not 
only causes pain to a patient but entails a heavy expenditure 
for healing, and is expected to give rise to a great social 
problem with the recent increase in aged population. Healing 
of these wounds generally depends on synthesis of connective 
tissues and epithelial tissues by cell proliferation. A drug 
which stimulates or accelerates the differentiation and 
proliferation of cells at the lesion is believed valuable in 
healing of a wound. Known drugs for accelerating healing of a wound mainly 
include extracts of naturally occurring substances, e.g., aloe, 
antibiotics, antiphlogistics, kallikrein, adenine, nicotinic 
acid, allantoin, vitamin A, zinc, c-AMP derivatives (see JP-A-63-107935,  
 
63-107935, the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"), 
etc., and improved formulations for improving 
absorbability of the active ingredient have been 
proposed. With the recent various dermatohistological 
elucidations, an attempt at applying an epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) to postoperative healing of a wound has also 
been reported (see JP-A-3-106823). GB-A-2 263 234 discloses that the compound 
diisopropyl 1,3-dithiol-2-ylidenemalonate may be used as 
the active ingredient of a composition for accelerating 
wound healing. However, the known compounds exemplified above have 
not been considered to have sufficient effects on healing 
a wound. Accordingly, it has been demanded to find a 
drug which has greater activity as a wound healing agent. Under the above-mentioned circumstances, the present 
inventors have extensively conducted investigations for 
the purpose of providing a drug for topical use effective 
for healing of a skin wound. As a result, they have 
found an excellent effect in a compound represented by 
formula (I) shown below and completed the present 
invention. The present invention provides the use of a compound 
represented
