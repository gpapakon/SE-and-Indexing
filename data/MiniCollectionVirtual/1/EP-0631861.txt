<ABSTRACT>
Plasticized polyvinyl butyral sheet containing 
epoxy resin in amount effective, after prolonged 

exposure to light, to counteract reduction of 
adhesion between the sheet and a photoreactive 

component with which it will be in potential 
contact. The photoreactive component is typically 

a dielectric such as a metal oxide layer of a heat-wave-reflective 
or electrically conductive multilayer 

coating, which coating can optionally be 
supported on (a) a thermoplastic substrate 

sandwiched between two of such polyvinyl butyral 
sheets forming a prelaminate for use as a 

constituent of a laminated glazing panel or (b) a 
glass sheet component of such glazing panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyvinyl
butyral sheet for light-transmitting, layered
safety glazing panels and more particularly to such
sheet formulated to improve performance when a
heat-wave-reflective or electrically conductive
coating is included in such panels.Light transmitting safety glazings for
window, windshield, sunroof, skylight, intrusion
security, showcase, picture frame and like
applications are well-known. They include one or
more rigid transparent panels such as glass
combined in a laminate with an impact-dissipating
plastic sheet such as plasticized polyvinyl butyral
(PVB). It is likewise known to control the
strength of the bond between the plastic sheet and
rigid panel at a desired level since if too high
the plastic sheet undesirably ruptures on impact
and if too low, splinters of the rigid panel can
separate from the glazing, and if glass, can injure
a person in the surrounding area.It is further known to incorporate heat-wave-reflective
multi-layer coatings (sometimes
called "stacks") into such safety glazings to
reflect infra-red radiation while transmitting
significant visible light. The effect is to reduce
temperature increase from solar radiation within an
area delimited by one or more of such safety
glazing panels. Heating a metal layer of such
multi-layer coatings by electrical conductance
reduces the time required for defrosting or
defogging. Representative structures for vehicle
windshields are disclosed in U.S. 4,799,745 and
4,782,216. In such safety glazings, the initially 
exposed, uncovered top layer of the multi-layer
coating often contacts the plasticized PVB sheet.
Such top coating layer is often photosensitive in
that after extended exposure to light, the
initially strong bond between the sheet and top
coating layer deteriorates.As disclosed in U.S. 5,061,568 and EP-A-O
263623 published April
13, 1988, this adhesion durability problem has been
addressed by proposing a special cap layer on the
heat-wave-reflective coating to contact the
plasticized PVB, which cap layer is chosen for its
capability to preserve the bond under the influence
of light. Though overcoming the adhesion problem,
such cap layers are usually deposited by an
additional process sputtering step which can be
slow and therefore costly to the total value of the
safety glazing panel.Now improvements have been made in light-resistant
adhesion of plasticized PVB sheet to
photoreactive components of laminated glazing
panels which reduce shortcomings of the prior art
by avoiding reliance on sputtered cap
