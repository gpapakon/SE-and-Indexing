<ABSTRACT>
In a liquid cooling circuit for an internal combustion engine the pumped liquid flows from a liquid pump (2) with a pump housing (4) fixed on a front face of the engine housing (6) into a cover passage (8) formed by a front end cover (9). In order to avoid a seal face (15) between the pump housing and the front end cover, which is difficult to achieve, a tunnel-like connecting passage (13) is arranged in the engine housing between the liquid pump (2) and the cover passage (8), above which connecting passage the seal faces (15, 16) of the pump housing and the front end cover, separated from one another, run with the engine housing.

<CLAIMS>
Fluid circuit for an internal combustion engine having 
an engine housing, which bears an end cover on an end face 

and a fluid pump with a pump housing, from which the pumped 
fluid flows through a cover passage of the end cover,
characterised in that
 
a tunnel-like connecting passage (13) is arranged in the 

engine housing (6), having a port (7) to the fluid pump (2) 
on one side and a port (17) to the cover passage (8) on the 

other, and separate sealing faces (15, 16) between the pump 
housing (4) and the engine housing (6) on the one hand and 

between the end cover (9) and the engine housing (6) on the 
other extend above the connecting passage (13) between the 

two ports thereof. 
Fluid circuit as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the fluid pump (2) is a coolant pump of spiral 

construction, the spiral housing of which is constructed 
through the engine housing (6). 
Fluid circuit as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 
a fluid-cooled oil cooler (10) is arranged in the cover 

passage (8). 
Fluid circuit as claimed in claim 3,
characterised in that
 
the oil cooler (10) is secured to the end cover (9) and 

extends to a certain point at the end face into the engine 
housing (6). 
Fluid circuit as claimed in claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that
  
 

the coolant delivered by the fluid pump (2) flows partially 
longitudinally and partially transversely through the oil 

cooler (10), so that the flow is doubly deflected.
