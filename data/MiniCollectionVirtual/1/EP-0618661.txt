<ABSTRACT>
The balance of rotors for dynamo-electric 
machines (e.g., electric motor armatures), which are 

wound with two diametrically opposite, simultaneously 
applied coils of wire, is improved by ensuring that 

wire is fed to both coils in substantially similar 
quantities. This can be accomplished by monitoring the 

consumption of each wire as it is fed to its respective 
coil, and adjusting the tension with which at least one 

wire is fed to its coil to substantially equalize the 
wire consumptions. Alternatively, the tension at which 

both wires are fed to the coils is monitored, and the 
tension of at least one wire is adjusted to equalize 

the tension of the two wires.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to making armatures for dynamo-electric
machines such as motors and generators.
Although the invention will be described primarily
in the context of its application to electric motor armatures.
it will be appreciated that it is equally applicable
to rotating rotors in general which are wound with wire
for conducting electric current. For convenience, all
such rotors are referred to herein as armatures. Also.
althougn the invention will be described primarily in the
context of flyer type armature coil winders, it will be understood
that the invention is equally applicable to winders
that employ other types of coil wire dispensing members
such as the apparatus shown in commonly assigned,
co-pending US applications Serial Nos
07/738.199 and 07/742,629 (see EP-A-0 526 819).With reference to accompanying FIG. 1, finished armatures
10 wound with wire 12 in coil receiving slots 14
of a lamination stack 16 need to be prepisely balanced
prior to their final operational use. This avoids mechanical
malfunctioning, and also guarantees the integrity of
the armature, together with that of other components
which are assembled in the environment where the final
operational use occurs.It is common practice to use automatic balancing
machines at the end of an armature production line to
determine the amount of unbalance produced during the
processing stages and to correct for this unbalance by
adding or removing masses on certain parts of the finished
armature. The most common technique for automatic
balancing of armatures removes masses by milling
one or more grooves in the outer circumferential surface
of the armature stack 16.Unbalance (requiring balancing as described
above) may be the result of unbalances present in the
mass of stack 16, in the mass of shaft 18, in the mass
of commutator 19, and also in the overall disposition of
these masses as a result of the operations required to
assemble them to form the armature. Unplance of the
armature can also result from the operational steps required
to wind the coils of wire 12 in the slots 14 of stack
16. Although the disposition of the coils (and their
number of tums) around the armature is theoretically
correct for avoiding unbalance. practice has shown that
the winding process can introduce unbalance.In order to reduce the need for or the required extent
of a final balancing step in the manufacture of armatures.
it is an object of this invention to reduce or substantially
eliminate unbalance which may otherwise result
from the coil winding
