<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
purifying 2-O-α-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid.L-Ascorbic acid, which has the chemical structure
shown by the formula [I]:

is not synthesized invivo in human, monkey and guinea pig,
therefore is listed as an essential nutritive element, i.e.
vitamin C. L-Ascorbic acid takes part in some physiological
activities invivo; for example, in the hydroxylation of
proline and lysine which are necessary to synthesize collagen
as the main element of living connective tissues; the
oxidation-reduction reaction of cytochrome C wherein Fe+++ is
reduced into Fe++; and in the immunopotentiation via the
increase of leukocyte. These are because vitamin C plays a
significant role in the maintenance and promotion of health in
living body.Scurvy has been known long as a condition due to
deficiency of L-ascorbic acid, and is marked by weakness of the
skin, petechial hemorrhage, ecchymosis, and hemorrhages in the
gingiva and marrow. To prevent scurvy for the maintenance of
health, a recommended daily administration (RDA) is established
for L-ascorbic acid; in particular, 60mg for adult male and
50mg for adult female.Nowadays the use of L-ascorbic acid is not limited to
agents which enrich vitamin C as an essential nutritive element,
but is extending in various applications. More particularly,
because of the chemical structure and physiological
activities, L-ascorbic acid is useful as a souring agent,
reductant, antioxidant, bleaching agent and stabilizer in
various chemical reagents, foods and beverages; in pharmaceuticals
for susceptive diseases such as preventive and remedy for
viral diseases, bacterial diseases and malignant tumors; and 
further as a reductant, uv-absorbent and melanin-formation
inhibitor in cosmetics including skin-refining agent and
skin-whitening agent.The major drawback of L-ascorbic acid is that it
readily looses the physiological activities because of its
direct reducing activity, poor stability and high susceptibility
to oxidation.To stabilize L-ascorbic acid, some saccharide derivatives
of L-ascorbic acid have been proposed. For example, we
disclosed in Vitamin, Vol.43, pp.205-209 (1971), ibid., Vol.47,
pp.259-267 (1973), and Japanese Patent Publication No.38,158/73
a biochemical synthesis of L-ascorbic acid glucosides.Because of the facts that the glucosides are prepared
by similar methods; that the formation of an ether bond at the
primary alcohol group which is located at the number six carbon
atom in L-ascorbic acid leads to the glucosides as

acid, which method comprises:


providing a mixture containing 2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic
acid together with a

water-soluble contaminant;
separating said mixture using a water-insoluble
carrier in accordance with molecular weight or affinity

into at least two fractions comprising;

(i) a first fraction which is rich in
2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic acid, and
(ii) a second fraction which is rich in the

contaminant;
recovering said first fraction; and
crystallising the 2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-L-ascorbic
acid.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said
water-insoluble carrier is in the form of a column.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
said water-insoluble carrier is a strongly acidic cation

exchange resin.
A method according to claim 3, wherein said
strongly-acidic cation exchange resin is in an alkali

metal or alkaline earth metal form.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
the separating step is carried out by gel filtration.
A method according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said mixture is obtainable by allowing a

saccharide-transferring enzyme alone or together with
glucoamylase to act on a solution containing L-ascorbic

acid and an alpha-glucosyl saccharide.
