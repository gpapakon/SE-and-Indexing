<ABSTRACT>
Methods for enhancing the water-solubility of substantially water-insoluble compounds are disclosed by combining such compounds with a water-soluble polymer, e.g., polyalkylene oxide polymer or a cellulose ether, having a molecular weight of from about 50,000 to 7,000,000 grams/per gram in an amount effective to enhance the water-solubility of the compound in an acidic environment, e.g., pH less than about 5. Compositions comprising the compounds having enhanced water solubility are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR ENHANCING THE SOLUBILITY OF SUBSTANTIALLY WATER-INSOLUBLE COMPOUNDSField of the InventionThe present invention generally relates to methods for enhancing the water-solubility of substantially water-insoluble compounds by combining such compounds with certain water-soluble polymers.Background of the InventionMany hydrophobic drugs have limited solubility and dissolution rates due to their low water solubility. The bioavailabilities of many poorly water-soluble drugs are limited by their dissolution rates, which are in turn controlled by the surface area that they present for dissolution. Consequently, particle size reduction has been used to improve the availability of drugs, e.g. griseofulvin (Atkinson et al., Antibiot. Chemotherapy 12, 232, 1962), and sulphisoxazole (Fincher et al. J. Pharm. Sci., 4, 704, 1965). However, unless the formulation of micronized drugs (Yamamato et al. J. Pharm. Sci., 65, 1484, 1976) is carefully controlled, the increase in availability may not be achieved since aggregation (Lin et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 57, 2143, 1968) and agglomeration (Finholt et al., Med. Norsk. Farm. Selskap., 28, 17, 1966), or air adsorption may result in poor powder wettability reducing the effective surface area.With this in mind, techniques involving solvent deposition, lyophilization, solvate formation, micelle formation with the use of surfactants, and solid dispersion have been developed to increase the availability of drugs (Jun et al., J. Kor. Pharm. Sci. 20, 1120, 1990). 

The concept of solid dispersions was disclosed by Sekiguchi and Obi (Chem. Pharm. Bull. 9, 866, 1961). In their study, the eutectic of the poorly water-soluble drug, sulphathiazole, and the physiologically inert, water-soluble carrier, urea, possessed higher absorption and excretion after oral administration than sulphathiazole alone. Other water-soluble carriers commonly used in solid dispersions include polyethylene glycol ("PEG") (Simonelli et al J. Pharm. Sci. 65, 3, 355, 1976 and Chin, Arch. Pharm. Res. 2 (1), 49, 1979) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (KollidonÂ® Polyvinylpyrrolidone for the Pharmaceutical Industry, Volker Buhler, BASF, Ludwigshafen, 88, 1993), and cyclodextrin (El Banna et al. Pharmazie 30, 788, 1985). These materials often have relatively low molecular weights, e.g., less than about 80,000 grams per gram mole and can have insufficient effectiveness in acidic environments, e.g., pH of less than about 5.Accordingly, methods are desired to enhance the water- solubility of substantially water-insoluble
