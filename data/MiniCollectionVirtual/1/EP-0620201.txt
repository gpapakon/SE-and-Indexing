<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing micro-optical elements includes a first isotropic 
etching step of a plurality of openings 
16
 exposed through a layer 
12
 of a masking 
material on substrate 
10
 and a subsequent generalized etching step of the entire surface 
of the substrate 
10
 after the layer 
12
 is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the manufacture of micro-optical 
elements and, in particular, relates to one such method including both a selective etching 
step and a generalized etching step. As used herein the phrase "micro-optical element" is taken to mean those optical 
elements that are not reasonably susceptible to manufacture by standard manufacturing 
techniques. More specifically, the phrase micro-optical element is taken to mean those 
optical elements that are not reasonably susceptible to fabrication by standard optical 
grinding and polishing techniques. In many fields of endeavor there is growing need for 
micro-optical elements. For example, in the general field of optics there is a need for 
micro-optical elements to keep pace with the many improvements in both optical materials 
and optical electronic materials. In the micro-optical element field, in particular, there 
has been an increased demand for high resolution micro-optical elements to support the 
application of new materials and circuitry. For example, the widespread use of optical 
fibers has increased the demand for high quality micro-optical elements. In addition, 
considerable effort is being directed to the development of optical detector arrays. One of the difficulties facing both end users and the manufactures of such micro-optical 
elements is the consistency of manufacture as well as the ability to manufacture 
the devices to ever tightening specifications. In general, such techniques include the use of lasers to cut or otherwise 
microscopically form the particular elements desired. However, such techniques are time 
intensive and applicable only over limited areas of the piece being manufactured. 
Another way of manufacturing micro-optical elements is by use of replication using 
masters formed by either a laser assisted chemical etching (LACE) process or other such 
means. The difficulty with using master replication, for example, in non-optical 
applications is that the master must come in contact with the substrate and this allows, in 
many instances, for errors to be introduced as well as reduced effectiveness due to the  
 
limitations on the radius of curvature of the various elements. Further, the manufacture 
of large numbers of micro-optical lenses covering a large area is difficult to achieve and 
is currently very time consuming In addition, in many fields of endeavor other than optical elements there is a 
growing need for micro-elements. For example, in the instrumentation field there is a 
n
