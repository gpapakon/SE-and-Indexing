<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for sampling of an electrical signal 
(4) in order to obtain at least one signal weighted 

together from two or more samples, in which in a first step 
the electrical signal is connected to a number of 

capacitors (C1, C2) connected in parallel. In a second 
step, one capacitor is disconnected from the electrical 

signal at each time of sampling (6, 7, 8, 9) and in a third 
step, when the sampling is completed, the capacitors are 

connected together. In this manner, one or more signals 
weighted together are generated in dependence of the charge 

of the capacitors when they are disconnected from the 
electrical signal and of the capacitances of the 

capacitors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus
for sampling of electrical signals according to the
preamble of claim 1 and claim 8 respectively.In fields such as radar engineering and telecommunication,
information exists in the form of carrier frequency
signals. In order to extract the information the signal
must be demodulated, which is most often achieved by down-mixing
to the frequency 0, so-called baseband or "zero-IF"
systems. Often the down-mixing is performed in two steps,
first from high frequency to an intermediate frequency and
thereafter to the baseband.In the above systems, the information exists both in the
amplitude of the signal and in its phase. A simple envelope
detection is therefore not sufficient. For this reason the
last down-mixing is performed in two mixers in which one of
them is supplied with the intermediate frequency signal and
a reference signal and the second with the intermediate
frequency signal and the reference signal phase-shifted
90Â°. The frequency of the reference signal is then equal to
the centre frequency of the intermediate frequency.The result is two orthogonal signals which can be regarded
as a complex representation of the baseband signal in which
both amplitude and phase information are preserved. As a
rule, these signals are called I- (In-phase) and Q-(Quadrature)
signals. As modern signal processing almost exclusively uses digital
technology, the I- and Q-signals are converted into digital
form in an analogue/digital converter, after which the
signal processing, for example filtering, is performed.In many applications, and especially in radar applications,
the requirements for amplitude equality and phase orthogonality
between the I- and Q-signals are very high. This
implies that some kind of automatic, active calibration
procedure usually is used. The calibration procedure
consumes signal processing capacity and also requires
certain additional equipment. It is therefore desirable to
eliminate the need for calibration.One method of eliminating the calibration need is to
perform the analogue/digital conversion directly on the
inter-mediate frequency signal and thereafter split up the
obtained signal samples into one I- and one Q-value by
means of digital filters. Examples of apparatus which
utilize this method are described in the patent documents
EP-109121 and UK2176362.Even this method has drawbacks. The use of the method is
thus limited due to limitations in the conversion rate of
the analogue/digital converters in combination with
accuracy.
