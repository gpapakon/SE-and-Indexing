<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gelled composition for
internal use. It comprises a carrier for adsorption as an effective
ingredient, and belongs to the fields of medicine and food.Most conventional medicines comprising a carrier for
adsorption as an effective ingredient generally require large
dosages and are orally administered after being suspended in water
or the like medium. However, the compliance from patients has
been extremely low for several reasons. First, it is necessary
to suspend the carrier for adsorption in water prior to
administration, and this procedure is tedious. Second, the
carrier for adsorption leaves a strong taste in the mouth. Third,
the patient may sense a foreign substance in the mouth due to
the remaining carrier. Fourth, it has been very difficult to take
an effective dosage for treatment because of the relatively large
dosage of the carrier for adsorption as compared with other
preparations. Finally, the unpleasant feeling of a foreign
substance in the mouth while taking such a composition often caused
side effects such as nausea or vomiturition. There has thus been
a problem in medical treatment since the desired treatment effect
of the medicine cannot be fully obtained even though its high
usefulness has been clinically established.An objective of this invention is to provide an easily taken
composition comprising a carrier for adsorption as an effective 
ingredient.Conventional pharmaceutical preparations that include a
carrier for adsorption as an effective ingredient must be suspended
in water or the like medium before being taken. Furthermore, the
carrier for adsorption often has a strong taste and requires a
large dosage. Together, these caused a significant reduction in
patients' compliance with taking the preparation. Conventional
pharmaceutical preparations also pose a serious problem in that
simply decreasing the amount of solvent used for the carrier for
adsorption increased the unpleasant taste of that carrier,
resulting in further reduction of patients' compliance (no
improvement of patients' compliance at all). The present
inventors focused their attention on these issues.The present inventors considered that the unpleasant taste
was caused by the difference in the taste between the carrier
for adsorption and the medium such as water. We therefore sought
a dosage composition that would taste less like the carrier for
adsorption. Subsequently, wey succeeded in not only
significantly decreasing the dosage but also reducing the taste
of the carrier for
