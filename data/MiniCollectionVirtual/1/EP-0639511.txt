<ABSTRACT>
A can package (10) is disclosed, including an array 
of cans (12) disposed in longitudinal rows and transverse 

ranks. A first carrier member (16) of resilient, flexible, 
plastic material includes a similar array of apertures 

respectively receiving can bodies (20). A second carrier 
(18) member of self-supporting sheet material such as 

paperboard includes a top panel (32) overlying chimes (24) 
of the cans (12) and opposite side panels (34, 36, 38, 40) 

extending down along opposite sides of the cans (12) and 
secured to the plastic carrier member (16). Slits (44, 46, 

48, 50, 52) are formed in the second member (18) at 
junctions between the top panel (32) and the side panels 

(34, 36, 38, 40) for presenting opposing edges respectively 
extending over and engaging beneath chimes (24) of the 

cans. This engagement of the second carrier (18) beneath 
the chimes (24) facilitates lifting of the package when it 

is lifted by the second carrier, for example by using hand 
grips (102, 104, 106, 108).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel package, 
including a carrier and a plurality of containers, and more 
particularly to a novel unitary package for an array of 
containers, such as cans. Packages of cans, such as conventional six-packs or 
twelve-packs, have become well-known. One type of package 
utilizes a carrier made from a thin sheet of resilient, 
flexible plastic material, having apertures therein which 
receive and grip the cans. Another type of well-known 
carrier utilizes a paperboard sheet which is wrapped around 
the cans. Advantages of the aforementioned plastic sheet 
carriers include economy of production and assembly with 
the cans, but such carriers provide no space for the 
printing of trademarks, advertising material, and the like. 
Advantages of the paperboard type carriers include the 
enclosing of the cans and the provision of panels for 
receiving the printing of promotional or advertising 
material. However, many such heretofore proposed 
paperboard carriers are relatively expensive. It would be a distinct commercial advantage if it were 
possible to provide a container package which is both 
economical and constructed so that it may be utilized for 
displaying promotional or advertising material. Our earlier patent, US-A-3,700,275, which corresponds to the 
preamble of claim 1, discloses a 
package for bottles which includes a carrier of plastic 
material including apertures for receiving and holding the 
bottom of the bottles, and a second carrier of cardboard 
and including holes which fit over the necks of the 
bottles, and ensures that the bottles remain separated 
throughout their height. According to this invention a package comprises an 
array of containers arranged in longitudinal rows and 
transverse ranks, said containers having cylindrical bodies 
and an upper end, a first carrier member of resilient, flexible, 
plastic material having a plurality of constrictive  
 
apertures respectively receiving and retaining said bodies 
at a location substantially below said upper ends, a second 
sheet material member, including a top panel overlying said 
upper end, and side panels extending downwardly from 
opposite side margins of said top panel along sides of said 
bodies and substantially engaging portions of said first 
member, and means securing said side panels to said first 
member, and is characterised in that the upper end of the 
containers is an annular chime, and in that said second 
member has a plurality of discrete slits therein defining 
opposing edge
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A package (10) comprising an array of containers (12) 
arranged in longitudinal rows and transverse ranks, said 

containers (12) having cylindrical bodies (20) and an upper 
end (24), a first carrier member (16) of resilient, flexible, 

plastic material having a plurality of constrictive 
apertures respectively receiving and retaining said bodies 

(20) at a location substantially below said upper ends (24), 
a second sheet material member (18), including a top panel 

(32) overlying said upper end (24), and side panels (34, 
36, 38, 40) extending downwardly from opposite side margins 

of said top panel (32) along sides of said bodies (20) and 
substantially engaging portions of said first member (16), 

and means (62) securing said side panels (34, 36, 38, 40) 
to said first member (16), and characterised in that the 

upper end (24) of the containers (12) is an annular chime 
(24), and in that said second member has a plurality of 

discrete slits (42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52) therein defining 
opposing edge portions of said top panel (32) and said side 

panels (34, 36, 38, 40), said edge portions of said top 
panel (32) overlying said container chimes (24), and said 

edge portions of said side panels (34, 36, 38, 40) engaging 
said chimes (24) in opposing relationship to said top panel 

edges for supporting the containers (12) when the package 
is carried by said second member (18). 
A package, as defined in claim 1, wherein said 
second member includes hand-engageable means (102, 104, 

106, 108) for facilitating carrying of the package. 
A package, as defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
side panels include wide planar portions (34, 36) adapted 

for receiving decorative or advertising printing. 
A package, as defined in any preceding claim, 
wherein said containers (12) are cans including a generally 

frusto-conical portion (26) between their chimes (24) and

wherein the carrier member (16) includes weakening means 

(110) adjacent the connecting means (62) to permit the 
removal of the sheet material (18) to break the carrier 

member (16).
