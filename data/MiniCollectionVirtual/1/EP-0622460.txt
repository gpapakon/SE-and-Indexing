<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a plasmid possessing 
the restriction enzyme map shown in Fig. 1, and this 

plasmid is largely characterized in that the kil gene is 
linked downstream from the human CRP (C-reactive protein) 

gene. Using this plasmid, it is possible to produce large 
amounts of human CRP by extracellular secretion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biotechnology, and
more specifically, it relates to a novel plasmid carrying
the gene for human CRP (C-reactive protein), to novel
microorganisms, for example those belonging to Escherichia
coli, which have been transformed with the plasmid, as well
as to a novel method for the production of human CRP by the
culturing of the above transformant.According to the present invention there has been
established a method for the industrial production of human
CRP, and since the purity of the resulting human CRP is
extremely high, it may be used more effectively in the
fields of diagnosis and clinical examination, as well as
medicines.Human CRP is produced in the liver upon stimulation by
as yet unidentified stimulating substances resulting from
bacterial infection, histological ischemic disorder,
malignant tumors, etc., and upon reaching the site of
inflammation, it binds to the phospholipids of the
membranes of cells which have undergone necrosis, inducing
c 
such biological changes as the activation of complement,
the suppression of platelet aggregation, the acceleration
of various lymphatic functions, and the acceleration of
the functions of macrophages, by which the pathologic
products produced in the body by the inflammation are
removed.In the field of clinical examination, assays of CRP
levels in the blood are conducted by methods in which anti- CRP
antiserum is added to test serum thought to contain CRP,
such as the single immunodiffusion method and the capillary
method. However, the presently used abdominal dropsy-derived
antigen is prepared through purification for
removing serum components including SAP (serum amyloid P
component) whose amino acid sequence is highly homologous
with that of CRP, to such an extent that they do not
interfere with the antigen, and so requires many purification
steps, thus increasing production costs. In addition, when
making measurements of CRP in the blood using antiserum or
IgG obtained by animal immunization using as the antigen
CRP which is insufficiently pure, being mixed with serum
components, it has been difficult to make accurate assays
because of the background antibodies against the serum
components such as SAP which are not completely removed by
the purification.Consequently, as antigen CRP for use in the field of 
clinical examination it has been greatly desired to have
highly pure and economical CRP which contains no
serum components such as SAP.On the other hand, bacteria belonging to the genus
Escherichia produce absolutely
