<ABSTRACT>
Reagents that specifically bind a carbohydrate target wherein sialic acid is linked at the nonreducing terminus of a glycoside to a galactose or galactosamine residue through an  alpha 2-6 linkage are able to inhibit the conversion of human Factor X to human Factor Xa. These reagents (SA/Gal/GalNAc binding reagents) as well as other strategies for inhibiting the conversion of Factor X to Factor Xa are useful in treating thrombosis, inflammation and other conditions associated with excess thrombin activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to agents that inhibit
the activation of Factor X, and thus are candidates for
treatment or prevention of thrombosis. More
specifically, the invention concerns agents that affect
the normal glycosylation pattern of Factor X and thus
diminish its conversion to its activated form. The
activated form of Factor X, Factor Xa, is essential for
the formation of thrombin, which is, in turn, essential
for the formation of blood clots, as well as an inducer
of smooth muscle cell proliferation.Thrombin is a multifunctional protease that
regulates several key biological processes. For example,
thrombin is among the most potent of the known platelet
activators. In addition, thrombin is essential for the
cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin to initiate clot
formation. These two elements are involved in normal
hemostasis but in atherosclerotic arteries can initiate
the formation of a thrombus, a major factor in
pathogenesis of vasoocclusive conditions much as
myocardial infarction, unstable angina, nonhemorrhagic
stroke and reocclusion of coronary arteries after
angioplasty or thrombolytic therapy. Thrombin is also a
potent inducer of smooth cell proliferation and may
therefore be involved in a variety of proliferative
responses such as restenosis after angioplasty and graft-induced
atherosclerosis. In addition, thrombin is 
chemotactic for leukocytes and may therefore play a role
in inflammation. (Hoover. R.J., et al. Cell (1978)
14:423; Etingin, O.R., et al., Cell (1990) 61:657.)
These observations indicate that inhibition of thrombin
formation or inhibition of thrombin itself may be
effective in preventing or treating thrombosis, limiting
restenosis and controlling inflammation.The formation of thrombin is the result of the
proteolytic cleavage of its precursor prothrombin at the
Arg-Thr linkage at positions 271-272 and the Arg-Ile
linkage at positions 320-321. This activation is
catalyzed by the prothrombinase complex, which is
assembled on the membrane surfaces of platelets,
monocytes, and endothelial cells. The complex consists
of Factor Xa (a serine protease), Factor Va (a cofactor),
calcium ions and the acidic phospholipid surface.
Factor Xa is the activated form of its precursor,
Factor X, which is secreted by the liver as a 58 kd
precursor and is converted to the active form, Factor Xa,
in both the extrinsic and intrinsic blood coagulation
pathways. It is known that the circulating levels of
Factor X, and of the precursor of Factor Va, Factor V,
are on the order of 10-7 M. There has been
