<ABSTRACT>
A grille (3) for use adjacent an outlet of a 
heating, ventilating or air conditioning system comprising 

a frame 15 and a plurality of blades 25 extending between 
opposed frame parts. Each blade 25 has a spindle 26 which 

is rotatably supported within opposed slots 21 formed in 
the opposed parts of the frame. The slots 21 are open at 

one end to permit the insertion of the blade spindle and 
the spindle is supported at the closed ends of the slots. 

The grille 3 further comprises means for retaining the 
blade spindles 26 in the slots 21. The retaining means 

comprise an element 30 mountable upon the frame 15 of the 
grille such that part of the retaining element 30 engages 

the blade spindles 26 when mounted upon the frame and 
prevents the spindles 26 from moving out of the open ends 

of the slots 21.

<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates broadly to the area of 
heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems and more 
particularly to a grille for use adjacent an outlet of such 
a system and through which air is supplied to or extracted 
from a space to be ventilated. The invention also relates 
to an arrangement for mounting a grille adjacent an outlet 
of a heating, ventilating or air conditioning system. At an outlet of a heating, ventilating or air 
conditioning system the ducting through which air is 
supplied or extracted may be connected to a so-called neck 
reducer or a plenum chamber which may be considered as a 
box which acts as an air buffer. Commonly the neck reducer 
or plenum chamber acts as a transition piece having a 
circular inlet adapted to be connected to the ducting and 
a rectangular outlet. A damper may be provided at the 
outlet of the heating, ventilating or air conditioning 
system, the damper having a set of blades movable to 
different settings between fully opened and fully closed 
positions in order to regulate the flow of air through the 
associated outlet. A grille is usually provided at the 
outlet, the grille being the component which is visible 
from within the space to be ventilated. The grille is 
usually mounted so as to be flush with a ceiling (which may 
be a false or suspended ceiling) or a wall in which an 
opening is formed at the position where the outlet of the 
heating, ventilating or air conditioning system is to be 
located. When air is to be supplied to a space to be 
ventilated it is conveyed along the ducting of the heating, 
ventilating or air conditioning system and passes through 
the plenum chamber/neck reducer and then through the damper  
 
before entering the space to be ventilated via the grille 
which typically incorporate blades which serve to direct 
the air in a desired direction. The grille is usually mounted in position upon a 
ceiling or a wall by means of mounting screws or the like 
which are passed through a flange formed on part of the 
grille and into the ceiling or wall. However, such 
mounting means can sometimes be unsightly and are awkward 
to instal when one bears in mind that the grille must be 
held in position at the same time as the screws are 
located. The present invention seeks to provide an improved 
grille for use adjacent an outlet of a heating, ventilating 
or air conditioning system. According to a first aspect of this invention there 
is provided a grille for use adjacent an outlet of a 
heating, ventilating or air
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A grille for use adjacent an outlet of a heating, 
ventilating or air conditioning system, the grille 

comprising a frame and a plurality of blades extending 
between opposed frame parts, each blade having a spindle 

which is rotatably supported within opposed slots formed in 
the opposed parts of the frame, the slots being open at one 

end to permit the insertion of a blade spindle therein, the 
spindle being supported at the closed ends of the slots, 

the grille further comprising means for retaining the blade 
spindle in the slots, the retaining means comprising a 

separate retaining element mountable on the frame of the 
grille, the frame defining a channel and the retaining 

element being designed to be slidingly inserted into the 
channel upon the frame such that part of the retaining 

element engages the blade spindle when mounted upon the 
frame and prevents the spindle from moving out of the open 

ends of the slots. 
A grille according to Claim 1 wherein the frame of 
the grille comprises an upstanding wall formed with an 

overturned lip at its upper edge, the retaining element 
comprising a panel formed with a hook-like projection along 

one edge, the hook-like projection defining a recess within 
which the overturned lip of the frame is retained when the 

panel is slidingly inserted into the channel defined by the 
frame. 
A grille according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein an 
edge of the retaining element engages each of the blade 

spindles when the retaining element is mounted upon the 
frame of the grille and prevents movement of the spindles 

towards the open end of the slots within which they are 
supported. 
A grille according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein 
the retaining element comprises biasing means which engage 

the blade spindles when the retaining element is mounted 
upon the frame of the grille, the biasing means serving to 

urge the spindles towards the closed ends of the slots 
within which they are supported. 
A grille according to Claim 4 wherein the biasing 
means comprise a plurality of independent biasing members, 

each biasing member engaging a single spindle and urging 
that spindle towards the closed end of the slot in which it 

is supported. 
A grille according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
wherein two retaining elements are provided for mounting on 

opposed part of the frame of the grille. 
A grille according to any one of Claims 1 to 6 
wherein the frame is of rectangular form having two pairs 

of opposed upstanding frame walls, each pair of opposed 
frame walls defining a plurality of slots which are open at 

one end and which receive spindles of blades supported 
within the frame, there being a first set of blades 

extending parallel with each other in a first direction and 
a second set of blades extending parallel with each other 

and extending substantially perpendicularly to the first 
set of blades. 
A mounting arrangement for mounting a grille 
adjacent an opening in a structural element at an outlet of 

a heating, ventilating or air conditioning system, the 
arrangement comprising a grille having a frame and a 

plurality of blades extending between opposed frame parts, 
the frame having a portion designed to project into the 

opening defined by the structural element and a portion 
 

which projects laterally to conceal the periphery of the 
opening when the grille is located in situ, the mounting 

arrangement further comprising a component mountable on the 
structural element which defines the opening at the outlet 

of the heating, ventilating or air conditioning system, the 
component and the grille frame being formed with cooperating 

snap-fitting connections located such that when 
the component is mounted on the structural element and the 

frame is passed into the opening defined by the structural 
element a connection is established between the component 

and the frame which serves to support the grille and which 
is concealed from view by the frame of the grille. 
A mounting arrangement according to Claim 8 wherein 
the component which is mountable upon the structur
al 
element comprises a frame of generally L-shaped cross 

section, the L-sectioned framed corresponding approximately 
in size to the size of the frame of the grille. 
A mounting arrangement according to Claim 9 wherein 
the snap-fitting connection is established by means of 

outwardly extending projections formed on the frame of the 
grille engaging behind a free edge of one limb of the L-sectioned 

frame, said one limb of the L-sectioned frame 
projecting slightly inwardly such that as the frame is 

passed into the opening defined by the structural element 
the outwardly directed projections engage said one limb and 

the limb flexes outwardly until the projections snap behind 
the free edge of the limb.
