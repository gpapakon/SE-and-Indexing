<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition 
useful to impart a glistening appearance to surfaces 
such as automobile engine surfaces, and more 
particularly relates to a composition which will 
impart a glistening, shiny appearance to metal and 
other surfaces such as automobile engine surfaces and 
provide the surface with a protective and glossy 
coating. A problem which has always existed in the 
automotive field is that automotive engines accumulate 
dirt, oil and grease, which tend to prevent heat 
transfer and contribute to warmer running engines. 
Further, the accumulation of dirt, oil and grease 
detracts from the appearance of the engine and is a 
detriment during maintenance. Various preparations and techniques have been used 
over the years to clean such engines without having to 
remove the engine from the vehicle and submerging in 
solvent. For example, flushing the engine with a water 
hose, physically scraping the engine and application of 
various liquid compositions have all been utilized in 
attempts to degrease or clean automobile engines. Engine cleaners may be generally classified as all 
solvent-based types or all water-based types. Such 
known compositions generally include detergents and/or 
combinations of solvents with aqueous detergents. 
Solvent-based cleaners are generally used by spraying 
on the engine by a conventional means. Before the  
 
solvent runs off the engine, it is sprayed or flushed 
with water to form an emulsion with the solvent to give 
better cleaning action. Water-based products are known to be used to clean 
engines and such products have good wetting ability 
and cleaning power. Water-based products generally 
contain water soluble detergents and, while effective 
to remove dirt, are not as effective on oil and grease. 
Combinations of solvents and detergents are also known 
in the prior art which is usually in the emulsion 
form. A further problem in cleaning of automobile 
engines is the appearance. It is desirable to maintain 
a good appearance of the engine as the accumulation of 
oil, grease and dirt over time adversely affects the 
appearance and adversely affects maintenance. It is also desirable among automobile enthusiasts 
to maintain an attractive appearance for automobile 
engines, especially in show cars and the like. The 
present invention provides a composition which provides 
an attractive and shiny coating to an automobile 
engine. It is accordingly one object of the present 
invention to provide a water-based composition which
