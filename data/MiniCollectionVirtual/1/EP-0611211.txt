<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for monitoring and controlling the movement of a slung load. The system according to a preferred variant of the invention comprises a speed controller (Cvit), a ramp generator (GRAMPE) and circuits (100) for controlling the speed (V(p)) of the slung load. According to the invention, a feedback chain (131) is provided, the output of which is linked to an input of a comparator (140) receiving a reference speed control signal (R(p)) on its other input. The output signal is passed to the speed control circuits (100). The feedback chain (131) is configured to stabilise the output speed. Application to assisted operation of lifting apparatus, especially dockside apparatus.
