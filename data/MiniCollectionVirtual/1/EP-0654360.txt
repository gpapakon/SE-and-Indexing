<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
field of apparatus and method for binding a book and more 
particulary, to automatic bookbinding apparatus which 
utilize a binding tape comprised of a substrate which 
carries an adhesive. Apparatus for binding books utilizing a binding 
tape carrying heat and/or pressure actuated adhesives 
are well known. For example, US-A-3,928,119 and 
US-A-3,911,517 disclose a bookbinding machine for binding 
a stack of sheets. The stack of sheets to be bound is 
first positioned on a movable plate and clamped between 
a pair of guides. A binding tape is positioned under 
the movable plate, below the spine of the book. The 
binding tape is supported intermediate two moveable 
heated platens and above a fixed heated platen. Once the book is positioned, the moveable plate is 
moved away from the book and the book is translated 
downward, towards the binding strip. The spine of the 
book engages the binding strip and forces the strip down 
between the two moveable heated platen until the center 
of the strip contacts the fixed heated platen. The 
moveable heated platens are positioned apart a distance 
slightly greater than the width of the book so that the 
periphery of the binding tape will fold over the front 
and rear book covers. The moveable platens are then forced together so as 
to seal the periphery of the binding strip to the front 
and back cover sheets using heat and pressure. The 
fixed heated platen functions to melt the central 
binding tape adhesive so as to wet the spine of the book  
 
(the edges of the sheet) with adhesive. The moveable 
platens are then retracted and the bound book is removed 
and permitted to cool. A further bookbinding apparatus is disclosed in US-A-3,531,358. 
The stack of sheets to be bound is gripped 
between a pair of opposing clamps. A binding tape having 
heat and pressure sensitive adhesive is positioned on 
top of a pair of heated moveable platens. The stack is 
then lowered on the binding tape so that molten adhesive 
contacts the edges of the sheets. The pair of opposing platens then separate a 
distance slightly wider than the stack and the stack is 
forced down between the opposing platens thereby causing 
the peripheries of the binding tape to fold up against 
the front and back covers of the stack. The opposing 
platens are then forced against the stack so as to seal 
the tape to the covers. The platens are then opened so 
that the bound book may be removed. In the abovementioned US-A-3 911 517 there is 
described a
