<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a resonant circuit incorporating 
at least a coil (L1) therein and a switching circuit for 

oscillation is connected to the resonant circuit and 
voltage doubler rectifier circuits (31) and (32) constituted 

of capacitors (C11,C12,C21 and C22) and diodes (D11,D12,D21 and D22) 
are also connected to the resonant circuit. 

When the switching circuit for oscillation is turned to 
be on and off, the resonant voltage (V
L1
) is generated in 
the resonant circuit and rectified with a voltage doubler 

amplitude by the voltage doubler rectifier circuits (31) 
and (32). A switching circuit for output changing over is 

connected to zero voltage terminals of the diodes (D11) and 
(D21) in the voltage doubler rectifier circuits (31) and (32). 

When the switching circuit for output changing over is 
turned to be on and off, an output voltage is selectively 

generated at output terminals (OUT1) and (OUT2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high voltage
power supply circuit, particularly, but not exclusively,
to a circuit capable of switching between positive and
negative output voltages.A conventional high voltage power supply circuit for
changing over a positive or negative output employs both
transistors for positive and negative outputs and the
positive and negative outputs are achieved by both
transistors being selectively turned on or off.The conventional high voltage power supply circuit
has incorporated thereinto both transformers for positive
and negative outputs. There are disposed switching
transistors at the respective primary windings of each
transformer which are selectively turned on and off.There are also disposed rectifier circuits
constituted of a diode and a capacitor at the respective 
secondary windings of each transformer. Each rectifier
circuit, in which the diode has a different connection in
polarity with each other, provides a positive or a
negative output through an output terminal in response to
turning on or off of the switching transistors.This kind of the high voltage power supply circuit
employs a load resistor in a circuit for a negative
output to avoid the influence from the circuit for a
negative output when a circuit for a positive output
generates a positive output, and on the contrary, a load
resistor in the circuit for a positive output to avoid
the influence from the circuit for a positive output when
the circuit for a negative output generates a negative
output. Accordingly, since output current flows through
the load resistor, the output voltage will decrease when
the output current increases so that the output load
characteristic (regulation) of the high voltage power
supply circuit is aggravated.To solve the above problem, there are provided, in
the conventional high voltage power supply circuit,
resistors between the rectifier circuit and the output
terminal which divide the output voltage and the divided
voltage is fed back to a control circuit which turns on
or off the switching transistors. Accordingly, the
output voltage should be regulated by controlling pulse 
widths output to the transistors, which makes the high
voltage power supply circuit complicated and large sized,
thereby causing the hike of the cost.There has been also proposed a high voltage power
supply circuit to avoid the aggravation of the output
load characteristic which eliminates the load resistors
for positive and negative outputs. The proposed high
voltage power supply circuit is
