<ABSTRACT>
A ceiling structure with a reinforced cast concrete ceiling slab (1), a plurality of cast concrete stiffening ribs (2) reinforced by lattice beams (7) and filling components (3) fitted between the stiffening ribs, each of which has a self-supporting three-dimensional lattice body having an upper (13) and a lower lattice (14), web wires (19) binding the lattices (13, 14) together at predetermined intervals and a displacement body (20) irremovably secured by the web wires (19) between the lattices, in which the displacement body (20) of the filling component lies flush against a cast-on base strip (12) in a lattice beam (7) having such a strip or, in a lattice beam cast in situ, its underside lies flush against the side-members of a shuttering plate.

<CLAIMS>
A slab structure comprised of a reinforced poured 
concrete slab (1), a plurality of poured concrete stiffening 

ribs (2) reinforced by lattice girders (7, 7') and filling 
elements (3) disposed between the stiffening ribs, each filling 

element (3) having a self-supporting three-dimensional gridwork 
body comprised of an upper gridwork mat (13) and a lower 

gridwork mat (14; 14'), fixed connecting rods (19) connecting 
the gridwork mats (13; 14, 14') at a predetermined distance 

apart, and a one-piece separator body (20) securely fixed 
between the gridwork mats (13; 14, 14') by means of the 

connecting rods (19), characterized in that either in the case 
of a lattice girder (7) which is included in a concretized base 

beam (12), the separator body (20) of the filling element (3) 
is sealingly lodged against said base beam, or in the case of a 

lattice girder (7') which is concretized by pouring of concrete 
in situ, the lower side of said separator body (20) in the edge 

region is overlapped by a side portion of a base beam (12') 
which forms a bottom boundary of the stiffening rib (2) and is 

formed by means of a temporary form panel (22), and in that the 
lower side of the separator body (20) and the lower gridwork 

mat (14, 14') of the gridwork bodies remain between the 
adjacent sides of the base beams (12, 12') without concrete 

covering. 
A slab structure according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the side portions of the base beam (12') or the side 

portions (23) of the form panel (22), respectively, extend 
slightly obliquely outwards and upwards, the side portions of 

the form panel comprising slots (24) for the wires of the lower 
gridwork mat (14, 14'). 
A slab structure according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the reinforcement of the slab (1) is 

formed by the upper gridwork mats (13) of the filling elements 
(3) and gap reinforcements (21) disposed in the regions of the 

stiffening ribs (2), which reinforcements (21) overlap the 
gridwork mats (13) at their edge regions. 
A method of constructing a slab structure according 
to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a plurality of  

 
pillars (26) are erected at predetermined distances apart, 

which distances correspond to the respective lengths and widths 
of the filling elements (3), a plurality of supporting boards 

(27) are placed on said pillars (26), which boards (27) extend 
flush with the stiffening ribs (2), and a plurality of prop 

boards (28) for the filling elements (3) are placed on said 
supporting boards (27) at positions disposed at edges of the 

stiffening ribs (2), whereupon either respective concretized 
base beams (12), each of which includes a lattice girder (7), 

are placed on the respective supporting boards (27), or 
respective concrete-form panels (22) for concretizing the 

stiffening ribs (2) in situ are placed on the respective 
supporting boards (27), the concrete-form panels (22) 

supporting the lattice girders (7') and forming a bottom 

boundary of the respective stiffening ribs (2), and in that 
thereafter either the filling elements (3) are disposed on the 

prop boards (28) and are sealingly lodged against the 
respective adjoining concretized base beams (12), or said 

separator bodies with their lower side are sealingly disposed 
against lateral parts (23) of the respective concrete-form 

panels (22), which lateral parts overlap the edges of the 
separator body sideways, following which the slab is 

concretized by pouring concrete. 
A method according to claim 4, characterized in that, 
in the case of stiffening ribs (2) which are poured in situ, 

the lattice girders (7') are supported on the concrete-form 
panels (22) by means of spacers (25).
