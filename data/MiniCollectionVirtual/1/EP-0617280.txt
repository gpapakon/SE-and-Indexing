<ABSTRACT>
A method of monitoring major constituents within a 
plating bath. The method involves applying an 

electrical signal to a working electrode positioned 
within the plating bath solution, varying signal 

parameters, and measuring the resultant response signal. 
The characteristics of the response signal indicate 

major constituent concentration levels. The method 
complements and is easily integrated with known 

voltammetric techniques for analysis of trace 
constituents, thus forming an integral part of an 

efficient overall plating bath analysis system. By 
adjusting major constituent concentration levels in 

accordance with measurements made using the method of 
the present invention, a high quality plating bath can 

be easily and inexpensively maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to plating
baths and methods for monitoring the major constituents
contained therein. More particularly, the method of the
present invention relates to a voltammetric analysis
technique that provides signal spectra which accurately
indicate concentrations of major constituents within the
bath. The signal spectra can be used to maintain
desired major constituent concentrations within limits
in order to ensure optimal plating bath performance.A typical plating bath solution is comprised of a
combination of several different chemical constituents.
The specific constituents vary depending upon the type
of plating bath, but in general can be broadly divided
into what are commonly known as major constituents and
trace, or minor, constituents. The major constituents
are defined as those chemical constituents which are in
excess of 5 percent of the total bath volume. Trace or
minor constituents, on the other hand, are defined as
those present in smaller quantities, i.e. less than 5
percent of the total volume. For example, in an acid
copper plating bath, a major constituent is sulfuric
acid, which typically represents about 8 to 12 percent
of the total volume. The acid copper plating bath might
also contain trace constituents such as organic addition
agents, degradation products and chemical contaminants,
present in much smaller concentrations.The concentration levels of both major and trace
constituents are important determinants of the quality
of the resultant plating deposit. Trace constituent
concentrations influence certain characteristics of the 
plating deposit, including tensile strength, ductility,
solderability, uniformity, brightness and resistance to
thermal shock. Monitoring and optimization of trace
constituents assumes that the major constituent
concentrations within the bath are already properly set
and maintained. Should the major constituents fall
outside of required concentration ranges, however, the
bath may fail to satisfactorily perform its plating
function. It is therefore important that major
constituent concentrations be regularly monitored.Current techniques for monitoring the major
constituents of plating baths typically involve removing
a sample of the chemical solution from the plating tank
for subsequent wet chemical analysis. Methods of
measuring major constituent content in various types of
plating baths are disclosed, for example, in K. E.
Langford and J. E. Parker, "Analysis of Electroplating
and Related Solutions," pp. 83-100, 65-68 and

A method of monitoring the concentration of major constituents
present in a plating bath solution, said method

comprising the steps of:

(a) applying a selected dc potential to a working
electrode which has been subjected to pretreatment and is

positioned within said solution wherein said dc potential
has an amplitude range of 2.4 to -1.5 volts and a sweep

rate of 20 to 500 mv/sec;
(b) superimposing a constant ac signal on said dc potential
applied to said working electrode, said ac signal

having an amplitude of 20 to 30 mv rms and a frequency of
50 to 2,000 hertz and producing an ac current;
(c) varying said dc potential at a chosen sweep rate
over a chosen range;
(d) using a phase angle offset for measuring said ac current between said working
electrode and a counter electrode positioned within said

solution as said dc potential is varied over said range,
said measurement of ac current in relation to varying dc

potential being expressed as an ac current spectra wherein
each parameter comprising said amplitude of said ac signal,

said frequency of said ac signal, said sweep rate of said
dc potential, said range of said dc potential, said phase

angle offset, and said pretreatment of said working electrode
is varied in combination, to determine the specific

value of each said parameter which, when taken in combination

with the remaining said parameters, provides maximum
spectra detail in said ac current spectra to determine and

monitor said major constituents in said solution which affect
said plating deposit properties wherein said major

constituents constitute in excess of 5 percent of the total
volume of said plating bath solution.

acid copper plating bath and further wherein one of said

monitored major constituents is sulfuric acid.
The method of claim 1 wherein said plating bath is a

The method of claim 1 wherein said plating bath is a
silver cyanide plating bath and further wherein one of said

monitored major constituents is potassium cyanide.
The method of claim 1 wherein said plating bath is a
silver cyanide plating bath and further wherein one of said

monitored major constituents is potassium carbonate.
The method of claim 6 wherein said dc potential has an
amplitude range of 0 to -1.5 volts where it was held for 10

seconds and reversed to 0.5 volts.
The method of claim 1 further comprising, prior to step
(a), pretreating said working electrode to remove contaminants

therefrom.
