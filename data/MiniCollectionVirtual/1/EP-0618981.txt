<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of determining the severity of diseases such as osteopenia by measuring the concentrations of certain blood constituents and then calculating a bone density coefficient. The blood constituents required for diagnosing osteopenia according to the present invention are calcium, phosphate, estradiol, progesterone, total alkaline phosphatase and an alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme. A bone density coefficient is calculated using the blood concentrations of these blood constituents. The bone density coefficient can then be used to classify severity of osteopenia in the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR DIAGNOSING OSTEOPENIA AND DETERMINING ITS SEVERITYTechnical Field The present invention relates to methods for diagnosing osteopenia. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for diagnosing osteopenia in a human or animal and determining its severity and cause by measuring blood serum levels of specific, predetermined blood constituents and then calculating a severity index. Optionally, the age of the human or animal can be factored into the calculation.Background of the Invention The term "osteopenia" as used herein means any decrease in bone mass below the normal. The term "osteoporosis" as used herein means a specific form of generalized osteopenia characterized by a decrease in bone density, low bone mass, and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue. Osteoporosis can lead to enhanced bone fragility and a consequent increase in fracture risk. Osteoporosis may be idiopathic or may occur secondary to other diseases.Bone consists primarily of an extracellular matrix containing (by weight) approximately 35% organic and 65% 

 inorganic components. The cells of bone represent a minor component of the bone constituents, yet they carry out a major portion of the function of the skeletal system. Bone cells help maintain serum calcium concentration within a narrow range to regulate mineral homeostasis while also being responsible for the continuous formation and resorption of the extracellular matrix, allowing response of the skeletal system to the mechanical forces resulting from physical activity.The major organic component of the extracellular matrix is collagen. This protein has a rigid rodlike structure and is composed of three alpha chains held together in helical fashion by covalent and noncovalent forces. Multiple collagen molecules form fibrils, and these fibrils in turn are arranged in bundles or fibers. It is the bundles or fibers of collagen that can be seen in the light microscope as layers or linear arrays,Non-collagen components of bone compose a very small portion of the organic matrix of the skeleton. This minor fraction consists of proteins, glycoproteins, mucopolysaccharides and lipids. Only a few of these components have been carefully identified and characterized.Two of the proteins that have been isolated and studied are osteonectin and osteocalcin. The synthesis of osteocalcin is vitamin K-dependent. This 6000 dalton protein contains the unique calcium-binding amino acid gamma-carboxyglutamic acid or Gla. Hence, osteocalcin has also been referred

Claims
What is claimed is:
1. A method of providing a diagnostic system for diagnosing osteoporosis and determining the severity of osteoporosis in a human or animal comprising the steps of: a. measuring the severity of osteoporosis in a set of humans or animals with varying severity of osteoporosis by a standard method; b. assigning the severity of disease a numerical value on a severity scale, the scale being from no disease to severe disease; c. measuring the blood concentrations of a predetermined set of blood constituents in the set of humans or animals with varying severity of the disease; and d. determining a numerical relationship between the set of blood concentrations and the severity of disease
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein the numerical relationship is calculated using multiple linear regression analysis.
3. The method of Claim 1, wherein the predetermined set of blood constituents comprises calcium, phospnate, total alkaline phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme, estradiol and progesterone. 


 4. The methc J if Claim 3, wherein the age of the human or animal is factored into the numerical relationship.
5. The method of Claim 3 wherein the alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme is selected from the group consisting of lymphocyte-derived alkaline phosphatase, liver alkaline phosphatase, bone alkaline phosphatase and liver alkaline phosphatase.
6. The method of Claim 1, wherein the standard method of measuring severity of osteoporosis is measuring bone density by radiographic absoφtometry, quantitative computed tomography, dual photon absoφtometry or direct measurement of bone density.
7. The method of Claim 6, wherein the standard method of measuring severity of osteoporosis is dual photon absoφtometry. 

8. A method of determining the diagnosing osteopenia in a human or animal comprising the steps of: a. measuring the concentrations of a predetermined set of blood constituents in the blood of the human or animal, b. determining a bone density coefficient using the numerical relationship of Claim 1; and c. determining the severity of osteoporosis in the human or animal by comparing the bone density coefficient to the severity scale of
Claim 1.
9. The method of Claim 8, wherein the predetermined set of blood constituents comprises calcium, phosphate, total alkaline phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme, estradiol and progesterone.
10. The method of Claim 9, wherein the alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme is selected from the group consisting of lymphocyte-derived alkaline phosphatase, liver alkaline phosphatase, bone alkaline phosphatase and liver alkaline phosphatase.
11. The method of Claim 8, wherein the age of the human or animal is factored into the numerical relationship.
