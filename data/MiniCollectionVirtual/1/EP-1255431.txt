<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a multipurpose machine for close-row production of tree or shrub plantations, such as vineyards or orchards comprising a working head (1) including a rotor (7) powered by a motor (5-6) and designed for receiving at least two interchangeable tools (10A or 10B). The invention is characterised in that it comprises a meshing guide (14) peripherally configured to mesh with the foot of trees or shrubs and arranged above the tools (10A or 10B), said meshing guide (14) being capable of rotating at a speed different from that of the rotor (7) and having, viewed from the direction of said axis, the general shape of a notched disc having at its periphery alternating notches (16) and projecting parts (17), the length of the operating radius (R1) of said rotary tools (10A or 10B) being not more than that of the radius (R2) of a circle tangent to the base of said notches (16) of the guide, which can thereby, in operation, successively mesh with the base of the trees or shrubs, when coming in contact with the latter.
