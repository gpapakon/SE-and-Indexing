<DESCRIPTION>
 DISPENSER FOR A STACK OF SHEETSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to dispensers for sheets disposed in a stack with each of the sheets having a band of adhesive coated on one surface along one edge by which the sheets are adhered together and with the sheets being stacked with the band of adhesive of adjacent sheets at alternate opposite edges of the stack.Background ArtOne dispenser for sheets of note paper in such a stack (i.e., "Scotch" brand "Post-it" Note Pads commercially available from Minnesota Mining andManufacturing Co., St. Paul, Minnesota) is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,416,392 assigned to the assignee of this application, wherein the stack of sheets is disposed in a box and the sheets can be withdrawn through a slot in the top of the box and centrally disposed parallel to the opposite edges of the sheets which are coated with the bands of adhesive. The box described in U.S. Patent No. 4,416,392, however, provides no means for preventing the second sheet in the stack from being withdrawn with the first sheet in the stack in response to force applied to the first sheet to withdraw it. Thus, to separate the first sheet from the second after the first sheet is withdrawn from the box, the first sheet must be manually peeled from the second while manually holding the second sheet, which is inconvenient.U.S. Patent No. 4,416,392 also describes a dispenser for such a stack of sheet material wherein a base is provided for supporting a removable cover within which is disposed the stack of sheet material. The cover is provided with an opening in its top wall and the stack of sheets is urged toward the top wall by 

a spring. The top wall is formed by two inclined portions which terminate at the dispensing opening. While the spring in this dispenser provides means for preventing the second sheet in the stack from being withdrawn with the first sheet in the stack in response to force applied to the first sheet to withdraw it due to the pressure the spring provides between the second sheet and the top wall, this dispenser comprises four basic parts to dispense the stack of sheets, and the sharp edges in the dispenser at the opening cause sheets that are dispensed to become stressed during the dispensing action about the edges of the opening so that the sheets retain a curl after they are dispensed. Subsequent non commercialized attempts to provide improved dispensers from such a stack of note paper are described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,562,938, 4,586,629, 4,586,630, and 4,586,631 assigned to

CLAIMS :
1. In combination, a stack of similarly sized sheets disposed in alignment in the stack with each of the sheets having top and bottom surfaces and a band of adhesive coated on a portion of said bottom surface adjacent one edge by which the sheet is releasably adhered to the top surface of the adjacent sheet in the stack, the sheets being stacked with the bands of adhesive of adjacent sheets at alternate opposite sides of the stack, said stack having first side surfaces at said alternate opposite sides of the stack, having second side surfaces disposed in a direction at a right angle to said first side surfaces, and a top surface defined by the top surface of the uppermost sheet in the stack; and a dispenser comprising a housing comprising walls having inner surfaces defining a cavity in which said stack of sheets is positioned, said walls including a normally generally planar top wall formed by a single layer of resiliently flexible polymeric material positioned adjacent the top surface of the stack, said top wall having edge surfaces parallel to the first side surfaces of the stack, said edge surfaces defining two opposed portions of said top wall and a slot through the top wall between the two opposed top wall portions through which slot projects a portion of the uppermost sheet in the stack so that when the uppermost sheet in the stack is withdrawn through the slot the top wall portion adjacent the band of adhesive on the uppermost sheet will flex away from the stack to form a surface adjacent the stack along which the sheet being withdrawn and the end of the second uppermost sheet in the stack to which the band of adhesive on the sheet being withdrawn is adhered can slide to thereby restrict curling of the sheets, and the top wall portion opposite the band of adhesive on the withdrawn uppermost sheet will place drag on the second uppermost 



sheet in the stack so that the force applied to withdraw the uppermost sheet will peel the uppermost sheet away from the end of the second uppermost sheet in the stack after it is withdrawn through the slot rather than fully withdrawing the second sheet through the slot.
2. A combination according to claim 1 wherein said resiliently flexible polymeric material is a plasticized vinyl compound having a Shore hardness generally in the range of about 35 to 100, and said top wall has a thickness in the range of about 1/16 to 1/8 inch.
3. A combination according to claim 1 wherein said resiliently flexible polymeric material is dip molded plasticized polyvinyl chloride having a Shore hardness in the range of about 40 to 80, and said top wall has a thickness in the range of about 1/16 to 1/8 inch.
4. A combination according to claim 1 wherein said top wall has through parallel flanking slits flanking said edge surfaces and said second side surfaces of said stack so that said opposed top wall portions are flap like with said slot through said top wall being between said flap like top wall portions, and said edge surfaces on said opposed flap like top wall portions are spaced from each other by a dimension in the range of about 3/16 to 2 inches.
5. A combination according to claim 4 wherein said through flanking slits defining each of said flaps like portions are in the range of 3/16 to 3.25 inches long.
6. A combination according to claim 1 wherein all of the walls of said dispenser are of 


resiliently flexible polymeric material, and said dispenser further includes a generally planar bottom wall normally generally parallel to and spaced from said top wall, and side walls extending between the peripheries of said bottom wall and said top wall, said top and bottom walls having generally oval peripheries with said edge surfaces extending longitudinally of and bisecting said top wall, said edge surfaces being separable by manually pressing said side walls adjacent the ends of edge surfaces toward each other to afford positioning said stack of sheets to be dispensed in said cavity.
7. A combination according to claim 1 wherein said dispenser further includes a generally planar rear wall normally generally parallel to and spaced from said top wall, and side walls extending between the peripheries of said rear wall and said top wall, said top and rear and side walls being integrally molded of resiliently flexible polymeric material, said rear wall having a through opening, and said dispenser further includes base means including a mounting portion adapted for supporting said dispenser on or attaching said dispenser to a predetermined type of structure and including an interlocking portion adapted, by resilient flexing of said walls, to be inserted through said opening and to engage said rear wall around said opening to retain said base means in releasable engagement with said walls, said interlocking portion being removable from said walls to afford positioning said stack of sheets to be dispensed into said cavity through said opening in said rear wall.
8. A combination according to claim 7 wherein said top wall has through parallel flanking slits flanking said edge surfaces and said second side surfaces of said stack so that said opposed portions of 


said top wall are flap like with said slot through said top wall being between said flap like portions.
9. A dispenser adapted for dispensing sheets from a stack of similarly sized sheets disposed in alignment in the stack with each of the sheets having top and bottom surfaces and a band of adhesive coated on a portion of said bottom surface adjacent one edge by which the sheet is releasably adhered to the top surface of the adjacent sheet in the stack, the sheets being stacked with the bands of adhesive of adjacent sheets at alternate opposite sides of the stack, said stack having first side surfaces at said alternate opposite sides of the stack, having second side surfaces disposed in a direction at a right angle to said first side surfaces, a top surface defined by the top surface of the uppermost sheet in the stack, and an opposite bottom surface; said dispenser comprising a housing comprising walls having inner surfaces defining a cavity adapted for receiving a said stack of sheets, said walls including a top wall formed by a normally generally planar single layer of resiliently flexible polymeric material adapted to be positioned adjacent the top surface of the stack, said top wall having through parallel flanking slits adapted to be parallel to and to flank said second side surfaces of the stack and to be generally centered between the first side surfaces of the stack, and said single layer having spaced edge surfaces extending between said flanking slits, said flanking slits and edge surfaces defining two opposed flap like portions of said top wall and a slot through the top wall between said two opposed flap like top wall portions through which slot can project a portion of the uppermost sheet in the stack when the stack is positioned in the cavity so that when the uppermost sheet in the stack is withdrawn through the slot the flap like top wall portion adjacent the band 


of adhesive on the uppermost sheet will flex away from the stack to form a surface adjacent the stack along which the sheet being withdrawn and the end of the second uppermost sheet in the stack to which the band of adhesive on the sheet being withdrawn is adhered can slide to thereby restrict curling of the sheets, and the flap like portion opposite the band of adhesive on the withdrawn uppermost sheet will place drag on the second uppermost sheet in the stack so that the force applied to withdraw the uppermost sheet will peel the uppermost sheet away from the end of the second uppermost sheet in the stack after it is withdrawn through the slot rather than fully withdrawing the second sheet through the slot.
