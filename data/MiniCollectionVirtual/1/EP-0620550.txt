<ABSTRACT>
An optical head apparatus for a magneto-optical recording medium (110) including 
a light beam source (21), an objective lens (24), a separating optical system (23 - 27), 

and a photodetector (28). The objective lens (24) is provided for irradiating an output 
light beam from the light beam source (21) as a focused light beam to the surface of the 

signal recording surface of the magneto-optical recording medium (110). The 
separating optical system (23 - 27) separates the light beam radiated from the light beam 

source (21) from a reflected light beam reflected by the signal recording surface of the 
magneto-optical recording medium (110) via the objective lens (24). The photodetector 

(28) receives the reflected light beam thus separated by the separating optical system 
(23 - 27). The separating optical system (23 - 27) also includes an enhancement 

element (26) which apparently increases the Kerr rotation angle of the reflected light 
beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical head. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an optical head for
recording signals onto an optical recording medium such as a
magneto-optical recording medium, or for reading signals therefrom.In the case of an optical head for reading out information
signals from a rewritable magneto-optical disc they can be
fabricated, for example, into a structure illustrated in FIG. 1.
Referring to FIG. 1, an optical head 1 includes a number of optical
elements described below. A light beam, emitted from a
semiconductor laser element 2 as a light beam source, is introduced
into an objective lens 3, so that the light beam can be converged
on the signal recording surface of the magneto-optical disc MO.
The divergent light beam which is emitted from the semiconductor
laser element 1 is converted into parallel light beams by a
collimator lens 4. A beam splitter 5, which includes an optical
prism (hereinafter referred to simply as a "prism") 51 adhered to
an optical element 52 having its edges arranged in parallel with 
each other, separates the light beam into emitted for the
semiconductor laser element 1 from a reflected light beam, i.e.,
a light beam reflected by the signal recording surface of the
magneto-optical disc MO. In further detail, the beam splitter 5
has a multilayered dielectric layer in the boundary plane between
the prism 51 and the optical element 52, that is, between the facet
(edge plane) 5a of the optical element and the prism 51. This
multilayered dielectric layer transmits the P-polarization
component, but reflects the S-polarization component. A total
reflection film which completely reflects the reflected light beam
from the recording surface of the magneto-optical disc MO is
provided on the other facet (edge plane) 5b of the optical element
52. The dielectric layer and the total reflection film are
provided by means of vapor deposition and the like. A Wollaston
prism 6 is provided to emit a plurality of beams based on the
aforementioned reflected light beam from the signal recording
surface. A Wollaston prism as disclosed, for example, in
US-A-4,771,414 can be used in the present invention. The
plurality of beams discharged from the Wollaston prism 6 are
focused on the photodetector 9 by means of an imaging lens 7. A
multi-purpose lens 8 is placed between the imaging lens 7 and the
photodetector 9 to generate astigmatism for the detection of
focusing error. Furthermore, since the multi-purpose lens 9
includes a concave plane on the output
