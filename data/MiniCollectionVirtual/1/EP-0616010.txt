<ABSTRACT>
A resin composition comprises an EVOH (A) and a 
thermoplastic polymer (B) having at least one functional 

group selected from the group consisting of boronic acid 
group, borinic acid group and boron-containing groups 

convertible into boronic acid group or borinic acid group in 
the presence of water. The composition may further comprise 

a thermoplastic polymer (C) other than (A) or (B). The 
resin compositions thus obtained have good compatibility and 

give molded products having superior transparency and good 
mechanical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to resin compositions
having good compatibility and superior transparency.Ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (hereinafter referred
to as EVOH) is, as it is, insufficient in softness,
mechanical properties, particularly in impact strength. To
overcome these disadvantages, thermoplastic polymers other
than EVOH, such as polyolefins are often blended with EVOH.
On the other hand, thermoplastic resins such as polyolefins
are insufficient in gas barrier properties, and to improve
this, EVOH is often blended with such resins. Japanese
Patent Publication No. 20615/1974 discloses a process for
improving the mechanical properties, particularly impact
strengths, of EVOH, which comprises treating EVOH with a
boron compound such as boric acid, borax, trifluoroboron, an
alkyl borane or an aryl borane.However, blends of EVOH and another thermoplastic
polymer such as polyolefin, having poor affinity and
compatibility with each other, give molded products or films
having markedly low mechanical properties and transparency.
For the purpose of overcoming these problems, a variety of
processes have been proposed, with no substantial success;
and development of a novel process to solve these problems 
has been desired.Further, as apparent from Comparative Example 2 to be
described later herein, blends of EVOH treated with a boron
compound, such as boric acid, and thermoplastic polymers,
such as polyolefins, have insufficient compatibility and
give molded products having insufficient transparency.DE-A-40 30 399 refers to macromolecules having a functional group
which may be derived from boranes. US-1-743 029 refers to ethylenically
unsaturated hydrocarbon polymers treated with boron compounds.
US-A-3 887 650 refers to a process for synthesizing block copolymers of olefins wherein a modifying diethoxylated monoborane is used.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a resin composition having good compatibility and
being capable of giving molded products having superior
transparency and good mechanical properties.This object can be achieved by providing a resin
composition comprising an EVOH (A) and a thermoplastic
polymer (B) having at least one functional group selected
from the group consisting of boronic acid group, borinic acid
group and boron-containing groups convertible into
boronic acid group or borinic acid group in the presence of
water.The object of the invention can also be achieved by
providing a resin composition comprising the above component
(A) and component
