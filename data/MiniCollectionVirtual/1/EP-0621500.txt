<ABSTRACT>
Applicants have discovered that a particularly efficient illuminating 
device for a transparent display (89) comprises a microtextured 

reflecting surface (92) formed 
on a major surface of a transparent substrate (90) and a light source 

(93) for directing light into 
the transparent substrate approximately parallel to the major surface. 

The microtextured reflecting surface (92) comprises a plurality of 
spherical segments. Preferably the 

substrate has two major surfaces separated by a thickness in the range 
0.5 to 1.0 mm 

so that the substrate acts as a light guide. A substantial portion of 
the light passing 

into the substrate undergoes total internal reflection until it hits a 
microelement and 

is reflected out of the substrate. The result is an efficient 
illuminating device 

particularly useful for lighting transparent displays.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to illuminating devices, and, more particularly, to 
an illuminating device particularly useful for illuminating transparent displays such 
as liquid crystal displays (LCD). By transparent display, applicants refer to visual 
display devices wherein either the visual message portion of the display or the 
background portion is transparent or translucent. The combination of microelectronic circuits and low power liquid 
crystal displays (LCD displays) has led to a wide variety of portable electronic 
products. These products range from electronic watches to hand-held television 
receivers and lap top computers. Low power consumption is a critical requirement 
for each of them. Despite their considerable utility in conjunction with integrated circuits, 
LCD displays have a number of shortcomings. In typical LCD cells the activated 
portion is darkened, representing a visual message, and the unactivated portion is 
transparent, constituting visual background. One shortcoming of LCD displays is the 
relatively low contrast between the activated portion and the unactivated portion. 
The contrast can be increased by backlighting the cell, thereby producing a sharp 
visual contrast between the portions of the cell darkened by activation and the light 
shining through the transparent regions. Unfortunately, conventional backlighting 
arrangements are inefficient. Even in so complex an electronic structure as a portable 
computer, the power used in display backlighting is the major drain on the system 
batteries. The copending application Serial Number 07/816405 discloses a 
microtextured reflector having dispersion characteristics of enhanced uniformity and 
a display device which can be read over an enhanced range of viewing angles. 
Specifically, a reflector comprises a base plane having a microtextured surface 
comprising a pattern of microelements having maximum lateral dimensions less than 
125 micrometers and smooth continuous mold-formed surfaces arising from the base 
plane. A preferred reflecting surface is composed of closely packed, smooth-surfaced 
spherical segments having diameters of twenty-five microns and attitudes of four 
microns.  Applicants have discovered that a particularly efficient illuminating 
device for a transparent display comprises a microtextured reflecting surface formed 
on a major surface of a transparent substrate and a light source for directing light into 
the transparent substrate approximately parallel to the major surface. Preferably the 
substrate
