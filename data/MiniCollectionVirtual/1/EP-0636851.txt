<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a blank cartridge having a propellant charge casing (1), which has a mouthpiece (2) and an inclined shoulder (3) and having a bursting body (4) whose rear section (6) is inserted into the mouthpiece (2) of the propellant charge casing (1) and is detachably connected thereto, the rear section (6) of the bursting body (4) having a circumferential groove (7) which is stepped in the axial direction into a flatter, rear region (8) and a deeper region (9) at the front, and a metallic retaining ring (10) being clamped in between the rear region (8) of the groove (7) and the inclined shoulder (3), the diameter and the length of the region (9) at the front of the groove (7) being such that it can accommodate the retaining ring (10), which is compressed to the external diameter of the rear section, and, when it is not clamped in, the internal diameter of the retaining ring (10) having play (clearance) with respect to the diameter of the rear region (8) of the groove (7). In addition to simple assembly, this results in there being no potential hazard when the blank cartridge is fired from a normal calibre barrel.

Training cartridge with a propulsion charge casing 
(1), having a mouth (2) and a tapered shoulder (3), and 

an explosive body (4), of which the rear part is inserted 
into the mouth (2) of the propulsion charge casing (1) 

and is connected to the said mouth, characterised by the 
fact that the rear part (6) of the explosive body (4) has 

a peripheral groove (7) which is graduated in the axial 
direction to form a flatter rear zone (8) and a deeper 

front zone (9), a metal retaining ring (10) being jammed 
between the rear zone (8) of the groove (7) and the 

tapered shoulder (3), the diameter and length of the 
front zone (9) of the groove (7) being such that it can 

accommodate the retaining ring (10) when pressed against 
the external diameter of the rear part (6), while the 

internal diameter of the retaining ring (10), in the non-jammed 
state, has a clearance in relation to the diameter 

of the rear zone (8) of the groove (7), the external 
diameter of the ring (10) in the jammed state in the rear 

zone (8) being greater than the internal diameter of the 
mouth (2). 
Training cartridge in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised by the fact that the thickness of the  

 
retaining ring (10) is approximately double the depth of 

the rear zone (8) of the groove (7). 
Training cartridge in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised by the fact that the retaining ring (10) 

comprises a split spring ring of circular cross section. 
Training cartridge in accordance with any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised by the fact that the groove 

(7) is located in the zone of a rear collar (6) by which 
the bursting body (4) is inserted into the propulsion 

charge casing (1). 
Training cartridge in accordance with any one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterised by the fact that the rear 

zone (8) of the groove (7) has an axial length at least 
equal to twice the diameter of the cross section of the 

retaining ring.
