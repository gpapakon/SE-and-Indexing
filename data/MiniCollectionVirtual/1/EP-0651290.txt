<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to single- and multicoloured colour proofs for the graphical industry which contain two layers A and B for controlling the optical dot enlargement. Layer A contains at least one polyolefin and, in a preferred embodiment, a light-reflecting white pigment. Layer B contains at least one binder, at least one light-reflecting white pigment such as titanium dioxide in a proportion by weight of from 50 % to 90 %, based on layer B, and at least one light-absorbing pigment. The invention also relates to a process and agent (means) for producing such proofs and multicoloured images (prints).
