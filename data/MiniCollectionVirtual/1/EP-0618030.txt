<ABSTRACT>
An annular front end base portion (11), a main portion (10) and an 
annular rear end base portion (12) form all together a substantial 

portion of a collet (9) provided with a tapered outside surface 
adaptable closely in a tapered hole of a collet chuck and a 

tool holding hole (13) is formed in the axial portion of the collet 
(9). In the main portion (10) are formed a first set of axially 

long radial slits (14) opening at the end surface of said front 
end base portion (11) and terminating to be closing in the rear 

end base portion (12) and a second set of axially long radial 
slits (15) opening at the end surface of the rear end base portion (12) 

and terminating to be closing in the front base portion (11). Each 
of the radial slits (14) of the first set and each of the radial 

slits (15) of the second set are arranged at proper angular intervals 
and alternatively along the peripheral direction of the 

collet (9), and respective zigzag paths (16) are formed which are 
closed over the whole peripheries of the outside and inside 

surfaces of the collet (9), respectively. The outside and inside 
surfaces of the collet (9) contact closely the inside surface of 

said tapered hole and the outside surface of a tool fitted in 
the tool holding hole (13), respectively along the respective zigzag 

paths (16). The collet is able to contract radially owing to 
the radial slits (14,15) of the two sets and the cutting oil supplied 

to the collet (9) flows out of the collet outwards only through 
jets (19) provided for feeding oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a collet chuck and a collet 
used in it and more particularly to an oil feeding collet 
chuck wherein cutting oil is supplied to a tool fitted in a 
collet chuck from an oil passage in a main body of the chuck 
and to a collet for the chuck. EP-A- 0 263 982 discloses a collet chuck having a collet which comprises a first and a 
second set of axially long radial slits, the first slits opening at the front end surface of the 
collet and the second slits opening at the back side of the collet. All slits of both sets are 
intersecting the clamping groove. There is no mentioning of an oil feeding to the collet 
chuck. DE 41 15 992 A1 discloses a collet chuck wherein internal oil feeding channels are 
provided. No axially long slits opening at the end surface are provided.  
 Fig. 7 shows a further embodiment of a conventional collet chuck. A main body 1c of the conventional collet chuck Ac comprises 
a tapered hole 2c, at one end thereof, to put a collet 
9c therein and an inside oil passage 4c communicating with 
the tapered hole 2c, as shown in Fig. 7. The outside surface 
of the collet 9c is made in a tapered form to fit closely in 
the tapered hole 2c. The collet 9c includes a groove 17c at 
the front end portion (the large radius side) of the outside 
surface thereof, a fitting flange 18c contiguous to the 
groove 17c and a tool holding hole 13c formed in the axial 
portion thereof. A plurality of axially long radial slits 14c 
are formed in the collet 9c at circumferential suitable intervals 
and terminate in an annular base portion 12c at the 
rear end portion (the small radius side) of the collet 9c and 
a loose hole 34 is formed in this base portion 12c. All the  
 
radial slits 14c are open at the front end of the collet 9c 
and communicate with the loose hole 34 and the tool holding 
hole 13c. The axially long radial slits 14c allow for the 
radial constriction of the collet 9c. The collet chuck Ac is 
provided with a clamp member 20c to press the collet 9c into 
the tapered hole 2c. Cutting oil is supplied to a tool 28c 
fitted in the tool holding hole 13c from the oil passage 4c 
through the loose hole 34 and the radial slits 14c. When the cutting oil is supplied at a constant flow 
rate, the axial speed of the cutting oil flowing out of the 
front end of the collet 9c is inversely proportional to the 
sum of those cross-sectional areas of all the radial slits 14c 
which are perpendicular to the axis of the collet 9c at the 
front end of it. This sum is considerably
