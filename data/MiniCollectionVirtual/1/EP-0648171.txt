<ABSTRACT>
The inclined elevator is comprised of a travelling chain, rope or cable with one or more push devices fixed to it at intervals. The elevator is intended for bicyclists or similar manned vehicles and is designed for installation in inclined streets, pedestrian tracks or in separate tracks specially designed for the purpose. The elevator chain, cable or rope is running in a conduit with a slot for the push device. The conduit is permanently installed on the ground. The push device is either running hidden inside the conduit on the ground, or, when in use, running on top of the conduit or guidance. During operation the bicyclist is sitting on the bicycle, and the bicycle is rolling on its own wheels. The push device pushes on the lower part of the person or the vehicle. The bicyclist is pushed upwards the elevator by standing with one foot on a push device fixed to the cable such as an inclined plate. The foot should be stretched backaords and the major bodyweight should be placed on the plate. The push device of the elevator could easily be adapted to wheelchairs, wheel wagons or similar.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONVEYOR ARRANGEMENT FOR ROLLING TRANSPORT DEVICESThe invention relates to an inclined elevator for man on cycle or on other rolling vehicles. The elevator is installed in inclined streets, pedestrian tracks or separate tracks specially designed for the purpose. For health - , environmental - and economical reasons modern society as well as individuals wish to transfer the transport of people away from automobiles and to public transportation such as buses, trains or cycles.By different kinds of actions and/or technical means the use of cycles could be stimulated. The disadvantages and obstacles of cycling could be removed or deminished. In most modern cities all over the world a wide net of separate cycle tracks are being built in addition to a lot of other actions to improve the security and the general conditions of the cyclists.Lately, the bicycle has gone through a technical development for example making it more suitable on rough ground/hilly terrain. This has led to increased popularity of cycling in towns/cities with a lot of hills. It is obvious however, that long and steep hills still represent a main hindrance for most of the cyclists. Saying this, we do not have in mind cyclists who are doing serious training. What really counis transport wise is cycling to and from work, shopping, social visits etc., where the purpose with the cycling is transport without to much p. ical effort. 

 Many towns and cities are characterized by terraced landscape where the major places of work and business areas are at the lower landscape level and where people live at the higher landscape level. Use of cycle between work and home is therefore depending on forcing one or more steep hills between terraced landscape.It is known that there are arranged vertical elevators for transport of people and goods where there also is room for a cycle. The cycle may also be transported on a rolling pavement. Ordinary elevators and rolling pavements are normally constructed for indoor use, and such installations represent for outdoor use dominating and expensive encroachments in the landscape and the street environment.It is also possible to adapt an ordinary gondola - or cableway making it possible to bring cycles. These cableways are normally suspended in masts above the ground but may also be pulled on tracks on ground level. These are normally installations that involve thorough and expensive encroachments in the terrain and street environment and often represent obstructions for crossing traffic. Elevators and cableways

Patent claims:
1. Engine-driven device for transportation of person on cycle or similar wheeled transport device, including an endless wire (1), belt or similar which is being placed in a loop between two end points, preferentially with level difference, and equipped with minimum one carrier (2) which is placed in contact with a forced guidance for the carrier, characterized by
- that the forced guidance (4;8;14) is placed in contact with the ground, and
- that the carrier is in guided enchroachment with the forced guidance, and arranged to get in pushing position towards the cycle wheel or towards a lower part of a person on the cycle. 2. Transport device in accordance with patent claim 1, characterized by
- that the carrier includes a foot device (2a) preferentially with a friction layer, suspension and damping. 3. Transport device in accordance with patent claim 1, characterized by
- that the forced guidance includes a stationary, flexible belt (8), and
- that the carrier includes a free running roller (18) which is led underneath the belt to form a wandering wave that serves as a sliding force towards the cycle wheel. 


 4, Transport device in accordance with patent claim 1, characterized by
- that the carrier (2c) is arranged with a free running roller (9b) with friction layer (12), which forms a sliding force towards the cycle wheel (11) starting the wheel to rotate.
5. Transport device in accordance with patent claim 3 or
4, characterized by - that the stationary friction belt (8) itself constitutes both the cycle's roller track and the carriers forced guidance. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 6 December 1993 (06.12.93); original claims 1-5 replaced by amended claims 1-3 (1 page)]
1. Engine-driven device for transportation of person on cycle or similar wheeled transport tool, including an endless wire (1), belt or similar which is being placed in a loop between two end points, preferentially with level difference, and equipped with minimum one carrier (2) which is placed in contact with a forced guidance for the carrier, characterized by
- that the forced guidance (4;8;14) is placed in contact with the ground, and
- that the carrier is in guided enchroachment with the forced guidance, and arranged to get in pushing position towards at least one foot sole of the person on the wheeled transport device. 2. Transport device in accordance with patent claim 1, characterized by
- that the carrier includes a foot supporting divice (2a) pushing on the whole foot sole of the person and arranged with a friction layer and a forward slope of approximately 30 - 40 Â°.
3. Transport device in accordance with claim 1 and 2, characterized by
- a start attenuating suspension and damping system (3).
