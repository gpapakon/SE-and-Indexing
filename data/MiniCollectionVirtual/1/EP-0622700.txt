<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
an image forming apparatus using a gear unit.The image forming apparatus includes a laser
beam printer, LED printer, an electrophotographic
copying machine, a facsimile machine, a word processor
or the like.In an image forming apparatus such as a
printer, a photosensitive drum is rotated, and a toner
image is formed thereon. In synchronism with rotation
of the photosensitive drum, a recording material is
fed, and the toner image is transferred thereto. The
transferred image is fixed by fixing means. In such
an apparatus, a driving force from a motor is
transmitted to the photosensitive drum, a feeding
roller and/or an image fixing roller or the like, by
way of a gear train.In such an image forming apparatus, the
feeding roller, the fixing roller, the photosensitive
drum or the like are assembled into the frame, and the
gear train is mounted to a roller shaft exposed
through a side part of the frame.A number of gears of the gear train for 
transmitting the driving force are individually
mounted on a frame side, and therefore, the gear train
assembling operation is time consuming. The mounting
accuracy is desired to be improved.GB-A-2 197 258 discloses an electrophotographic
image forming apparatus as in the preamble of claim 1,
in particular comprising a gear unit having a supporting
member for plural driving gears, the image bearing member
driving gear being supported by a gear shaft.
The gear shaft is, however, subjected to large loads.Accordingly, it is a concern of the
present invention to provide an image
forming apparatus having a gear unit in
which an operativity of assembling is improved.It is another concern of the present invention
to provide an image forming apparatus having a gear unit,
wherein the gear shaft supporting the image bearing member
driving gear is unlikely to collapse.These concerns are solved by an apparatus
as defined in claim 1.  These and other concerns, features and
advantages of the present invention will become more
apparent upon a consideration of the following
description of the preferred embodiments of the
present invention taken in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a sectional view of an embodiment
of the image forming apparatus according to the
present invention, depicting the general structure.Figure 2 is an oblique external view of the
same image forming apparatus as the one in Figure 1.Figure 3 depicts the structure of a process
cartridge.Figure 4 is an oblique external view of the
process cartridge.Figure 5 is
