<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatic control device for hot runner needle valves for injection moulds, which control device comprises a control piston (1), bearing the valve needle (10), a control cylinder (2) receiving the control piston, and a cylinder-receiving element (3), receiving the control cylinder. The control cylinder (2) is provided with compressed-gas channels (25a, 25b) for feeding and removing compressed gas to and from the cylinder chambers (4a, 4b) separated by the control piston. According to the invention, the control cylinder (2) can be pressed by one of its end faces (21) via seals (26a to 26c) against a contact surface (32) of the cylinder-receiving element (3), the seals (26a to 26c) bounding two mutually separate channel chambers (28a, 28b). The control cylinder (2) is displaceable on the contact surface (32) perpendicularly with respect to the piston longitudinal axis (b). Into each channel chamber (28a, 28b) there opens out a compressed-gas line (33a, 33b), leading through the cylinder-receiving element and for feeding and removal of the compressed gas, and from each channel chamber (28a, 28b) there leads a compressed-gas channel (25a, 25b), running in the axial direction, through the wall of the control cylinder (2) to a cylinder chamber (4a, 4b). The invention makes it possible for constraint-induced transverse forces on the valve needle (10) to be eliminated by the cylinder with the pistons for lateral displacement.

Pneumatic control device for hot runner needle valves for 
injection moulds which control device comprises a control 

piston (1) supporting the valve needle (10), a control 
cylinder (2) accommodating said control piston (2), and a 

cylinder receptacle body (3) accommodating said control 
cylinder, said control cylinder (1) being provided with 

pressure gas channels (25a, 25b) for the supply and discharge 
of pressure gas to and from, respectively, the cylinder 

chambers (4a, 4b), separated by said control piston,
 
   
characterized
 in that 

a) said control cylinder (2) is adapted to be pressed with 
one of its end surfaces (21) via sealings (26a to 26c) 

against an abutment surface (32) of the cylinder receptacle 
body (3), 
b) that said sealings (26a to 26c) form at least two mutually 
separated channel chambers (24a, 24b) between said 

abutment surface (32) of said cylinder receptacle body 
(3) and said end surface (21) of the control cylinder 

(2), 
c) that said control cylinder (2) is adapted to be moved on 
said abutment surface (32) perpendicularly to the longitudinal 

axis (b) of the piston, 
d) that each channel chamber (24a, 24b) is connected to a 
pressure gas conduit (33a, 33b) for the supply and discharge 

of pressure gas, 
e) and that each channel chamber (24a, 24b) is connected to 
one of the cylinder chambers (4a, 4b) via a pressure gas  

 
channel (25a, 25b) passing through the wall of the control 

cylinder (2). 
Pneumatic control device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the abutment surface (32) of 

the cylinder receptacle body (3) is formed by a recess (31) 
or some other receptacle opening in the cylinder receptacle 

body (3) the inner diameter of which is larger than the 
outer diameter of the control cylinder (2) to allow a clearance 

(c) for lateral movement. 
Pneumatic control device according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized
 in that the contact pressure of 
the control cylinder (2) against the abutment surface (32) 

is adapted to be brought about by a fastening device, for 
example fastening screws (23), attached to the cylinder receptacle 

body (3). 
Pneumatic control device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the channel 
chambers (24a, 24b) are formed by recesses on the end surface 

(21) of the control cylinder or on the abutment surface 
(32) of the cylinder receptacle body. 
Pneumatic control device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the sealings 
(26a to 26c) between the end surface (21) of the control 

cylinder (2) and the abutment surface (32) of the cylinder 
receptacle body (3) are of circular shape and are preferably 

arranged concentrically in relation to the longitudinal axis 
(b) of the cylinder. 
Pneumatic control device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the channel 
chambers (24a, 24b) are preferably formed as annular recesses  

 
concentrically arranged in relation to the longitudinal 

axis (b) of the cylinder. 
Pneumatic control device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the sealings 
(26a to 26c) are formed by sealing strips closed into loops 

which are inserted into corresponding slots (22) in the end 
surface (21) of the control cylinder or the abutment surface 

(31) of the cylinder receptacle body such that each sealing 
ring forms a wall of a channel chamber. 
Pneumatic control device according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
