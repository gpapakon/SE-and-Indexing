<ABSTRACT>
In clocked devices operating in duplicate for reasons of reliability, synchronisation with identical phase is desirable. This synchronisation is achieved by two phase-locked loops in the two devices which are connected and designed in the manner according to the invention.

Arrangement for synchronizing two clocked 
devices, having 


a) a first phase comparator (PD1) in the first device 
(G1), to one input (a) of which the leading first 

clock signal (C1) is fed, 
b) a phase locked loop in the second device (G2), which 
generates a second clock signal (C2) which is synchronous 

with respect to the first clock signal, the 
phase locked loop comprising a loop filter (LF2), 

and the phase locked loop comprising a second phase 
comparator (PD2), 
c) a connecting structure between the first and second 
devices, having 


c1) a first line (VL1) which feeds the first clock 
signal to the second input (b) of the second phase 

comparator, and 
c2) a second line (VL2), which feeds the second clock 
signal to the second input of the first phase 

comparator, the lengths of the first and second 
lines being identical, 
 
characterized 


d) in that with the aid of a differential amplifier 
(DV) the said loop filter (LF2) has at its input an 

inverting and a non-inverting input, a filter 
element (INT) with an integrating characteristic 

being connectea to the said differential amplifier 
(DV), 
e) in that the output signal of the second phase 
comparator (PD2) is fed to the non-inverting input 

of the differential amplifier (DV), and  
 
f) in that a third line (VL4) leads the output signal 
of the first phase comparator to the inverting input 

of the differential amplifier (DV). 
Arrangement for synchronizing in accordance with 
Claim 1, characterized in that the first device (G1) 

comprises a clock generator (VCO1) which generates the 
first clock signal (C1). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 

a) in that the first device (G1) comprises a phase 
locked loop identical to the second device (G2), it 

being possible to set the operation of a respective 
phase locked loop via a corresponding switch (S1, 

S2) both as a clock generator (phase locked loop 
open) and as a tracking phase locked loop (phase 

locked loop closed), and 
b) in that the said connecting structure between the 
first and second devices is extended by a fourth 

line (VL3) which feeds the output signal (P2) of the 
second phase comparator (PD2) to the inverting input 

of the loop filter (LF1) of the phase locked loop of 
the first device.
