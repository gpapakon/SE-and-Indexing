<ABSTRACT>
The internal (packing) element serves for plants for energy exchange and/or mass transfer and/or effecting chemical reactions between a liquid medium and a gaseous medium such as cooling towers, gas scrubbers, reaction columns and the like. The two media flow through the internal element in mutually opposite directions. The internal element has a first section (22) which comprises a multiplicity of essentially vertically arranged flow channels through which the liquid medium flows and which are joined together to form a package and have a meandering course over their length. The individual flow channels are connected to a closed feed duct system at their upper entry side to the feed line of the liquid medium. The recessed channel-like intermediate compartments between the flow channels provided within the package through which the liquid medium flows are open on both sides for passage of the gaseous medium. To the lower side of the package forming the first section (22) there is connected at least one zone as a further section which serves for direct contact of the media.
