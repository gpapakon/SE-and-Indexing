<ABSTRACT>
In a method of continuously coating a conductive substrate such as brass wire (10) to produce a desired cross-sectional size of coated material, the wire is drawn through a first die to produce an oversize wire, electroplate in a bath (32), and then drawn through a final die (44) to reduce its area to the desired size and produce a controlled surface finish. The wire may be cleaned in an acid bath (20) and rinsed in a rinsing bath (30) prior to the electroplating bath. A further rinsing bath (36) and dryer (38) may be interposed upstream of the final die (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method by which an
elongate substrate can be continuously coated. The invention
is of particular application to the coating or plating of a
metal alloy substrate in the form of wire or tape to achieve
a coated material having a desired overall cross-sectional size
and temper and from which pins are formed.For many applications wire or tape must be plated on its
external surfaces such as for protection or insulation. Where
the overall cross-sectional size of the coated or plated
material does not have to be held to a high tolerance, known
processes may be employed.Difficulties arise where continuous plating has to achieve a
particular overall cross-sectional size for the end product and
the invention is of particular importance in such processes.In patent document DE-C-2931939 there is disclosed a method and
apparatus for producing a copper wire which is heavily plated
with tin to a thickness of about 7 micron, but substantially
more than 3 microns. This is achieved by a pair of plating
baths which apply a total of 10 to 14 microns thickness of
plating. A drawing stage is interposed between the baths, and
a final drawing stage reduces the thickness to that desired.
Lastly the wire is annealed and quenched in water to produce
a stress-relieved wire of the desired size.Said document also refers to an earlier document, CH-A-310840,
which discloses a method of manufacturing copper wire which has 
only submicron thicknesses of tin electroplated thereon, by
subjecting the plated wire to a drawing process to produce wire
of the desired diameter. This prior document also suggests
that stress-relieving steps could be omitted.It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a
method for plating in a continuous manner a
conductive metal alloy substrate in the form of wire or tape,
from which surface treated pins are to be formed, so as to
enable the final predictable and accurately controlled cross-sectional
size of the plated material to be obtained.It is a further object of the invention to provide
a method by which continuously produced plated wire or tape
has not only a controlled cross-sectional size but also a
controlled surface finish.According to the present invention there is
provided a method for the production of surface treated, metal
alloy pins of a predetermined overall cross-sectional size,
which comprises continuously coating a conductive metal alloy
substrate by the steps of:
(a) drawing the metal alloy substrate through at least one die
so as to produce a first

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of surface treated, metal
alloy pins of a predetermined overall cross-sectional size,

which comprises continuously coating a conductive metal alloy
substrate (10) by the steps of:


(a) drawing the metal alloy substrate through at least one die
so as to produce a first cross-sectional size which is somewhat

greater than that desired for the pins;
(b) stress relieving the drawn alloy substrate;
(c) electroplating the drawn and stress-relieved metal alloy
substrate to a thickness not exceeding approximately 1 micron,

in a continuous manner as it passes through an electroplating
bath (32);
(d) drawing the plated, metal alloy substrate through a final
die (44) to reduce the cross-sectional area to the

predetermined pin size, whereby the desired degree of temper
is introduced by the final die into the substrate for the

subsequent pins; and
(e) forming the pins.
A method according to claim 1 in which the surface of the
metal alloy substrate is cleaned prior to the electroplating

step using acid or alkaline washes as appropriate.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the
plated, metal alloy substrate is rinsed and dried after it is

passed through the electroplating bath (32) and before it is
drawn, so as to remove any plating bath materials from the

surface of the plated substrate. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in which
the plated substrate material is heated and dried after rinsing

and prior to passing through the final die.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4 in which
the metal alloy substrate is a brass substrate, and in which

the reduction in size effected by the final die is also
arranged to introduce the desired temper into the brass

substrate as a result of the drawing through the die.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5 in which
two or more materials are plated on the metal alloy substrate

one above the other, the substrate being passed through second
and subsequent electroplating baths with appropriate rinsing

and washing stations between each bath, in manner known per se.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, in which
two or more electroplating baths (32) are arranged in series,

each plating the same material onto the metal alloy substrate
passing therethrough.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 7 in which
the step of drawing the plated substrate through a final die

also controls the surface finish required for the pins.
A method according to any of claims 1 to 8 in which the
electroplating is carried out at a speed of approximately 60

meters per minute.
Use of an
apparatus for producing surface treated, metal alloy pins in

the method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, the
apparatus comprising at least one die drawing means through which an

elongate, metal alloy substrate in a continuous length can be
drawn to achieve a first overall cross-sectional size,

characterised by stress relieving means located after the first
mentioned die drawing means, electroplating means (32) through

which the stress-relieved drawn substrate passes for 
electroplating on the surface thereof to a thickness not

exceeding approximately 1 micron, a final die drawing means
(44) through which the coated substrate material is drawn to

achieve the predetermined cross-sectional area for the pins,
and means for forming the pins.
Use according to claim 10, the apparatus further comprising a
cleaning bath (20) situated between the incoming elongate

material and the electroplating means (32), for surface
cleaning of the substrate.
Use according to claim 10 or claim 11, the apparatus further
comprising rinsing and washing baths (36) situated between the

electro-plating means and the final die means.
Use according to claim 12, the apparatus further comprising heating

and drying means (38) located between the rinsing and washing
baths and the final die means.
