<ABSTRACT>
A cylindrical filter is formed of stacked microfine 
conjugate fibers comprising a higher melting point 

component and a lower melting point component, each 
obtained by a melt-blow spinning process, the fiber 

diameter of the conjugate fibers decreasing across the 
thickness of the filter and in the direction of passage 

of a fluid to be filtered, and the contact points of the 
conjugate fibers being melt-adhered by the lower melting 

point component. 
This cylindrical filter is produced by a process 
which comprises subjecting a higher melting point 

component and a lower melting point component, each 
consisting of a fiber-forming thermoplastic polymer, to 

conjugate melt-blow spinning so that the fiber diameter 
varies during the spinning; winding up and stacking the 

fibers onto a core to form a cylindrical shape on the 
core with the fibre diameter decreasing across the width 

of the stack in the direction of flow of liquid through 
the filter; heat-treating the resulting web at a 

temperature above the melting point of the lower melting 
point component and below the melting point of the 

higher melting point component, before, at the time of 
or after the winding-up, and drawing out the core.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cylindrical filter for
precision filtration, prepared by winding up microfine
fibers according to a melt-blow process in a cylindrical
form, and a process for producing the same.Various kinds of filters have been known, which
are obtained by molding synthetic fibers into a cylindrical
form. JP-B-56-43139
discloses a process of winding up a carded web
of conjugate fibers onto a core under heating. However,
according to such a process, it is difficult to subject
fine fibers of 1.1 d tex (1 d/f) or less to a carding process stably.
Hence, a filter collecting fine particles of 10 Âµm or
less could not have been obtained. Further, in the
case of conventional synthetic fibers, an oiling agent
is coated on the fibers in order to prevent charge and
abrasion during the steps of spinning, stretching,
carding, etc. This oiling agent causes such problems
that it elutes from the fibers into the filtrated during
filtration, resulting in bubbling and contaminating
the filtrate such as foods, etc. On the other hand, as cylindrical filters for
precision filtration, filters using microfine fibers
according to a melt-blow process have been broadly used
as a filter for cleaning solutions for materials of
electronic equipments or as an air filter for dedusting
or as a prefilter for water, etc. used for pharmaceutical
products, etc.EP-A-0148638 (or JP-A-60216818)
discloses a process of winding up fibers obtained
according to a melt-blow process on a core after the
fibers have been cooled down to a temperature at which
they are not adhered to one another, and also discloses
a process of gradually varying the fiber diameter in
the thickness direction of the filter by controlling
the spinning conditions. In the case of such a filter,
the fibers are adhered to one another by entanglements
of the fibers almost without bonding of the fibers with
one another. Hence, the hardness of the filter is so
low that a sufficient pressure-resistance cannot be
obtained. In order to increase the hardness, a process
of winding up the web while heating it may be considered,
but the web is changed into a film due to melting of
the fibers, so that clogging of the filtering layer
occurs or the size of voids in the filter becomes non-uniform,
resulting in a product having an inferior
filtration life and accuracy. JP-A-1-297113 discloses a process of winding up several kinds
of non-woven fabrics according to a melt-blow process,
each having different fiber diameters and bulk densities,
successively each several times so
