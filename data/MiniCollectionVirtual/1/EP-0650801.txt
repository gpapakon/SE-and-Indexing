<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a pneumatic drive unit (1) which is connected to a feed element (7) via gearing (9) or directly. The drive unit (1) contains a rotor which is rotatable about the longitudinal axis (28) and on whose periphery sealing strips are arranged in the longitudinal direction. A working space is arranged along a section of the casing of the rotor. This working space is divided by means of the sealing strips and additional pressure-compensation passages into two pressure chambers of small volume. The inflow and outflow of compressed air to and from these pressure chambers and thus the rotary movements of the rotor are controlled via a valve (4) and a position control (3). The positioning device has only small effective air volumes which are always approximately the same size irrespective of the displacement of the feed element (7) and over the entire control range.
