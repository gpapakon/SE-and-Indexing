<ABSTRACT>
A metal component for joining workpieces (1;2) made of timber, derived timber product or plastic, consisting of a blade portion (3) providing a frictional joint with a first workpiece (1) having a groove (6) and a transverse hole (7) and a bolt-like section (4) which produces the frictional joint with the second workpiece (2) fitted with a longitudinal hole (8) by screwing or pinning. The plade (3) has a central drilling (5) perpendicular to the plane of the blade for securing in the groove (6) in the workpiece. Variants with a wing-like elongated or rectangular blade portion (3) in the form of a bolt-like component (4) like a conical wood screw (16), a cylindrical screw (17), a screw (18) with a metal thread or a pin (20). Accessories: insertion tool, hole gauge.

A metal component for joining a first workpiece (1) with
a second workpiece (2), based on the tongue and groove

principle, with it possessing a flat lamellar part (3),
which can be inserted into a groove (6) of the first

workpiece (1), and a pin-type part (4) provided on one
end face, which by insertion into a slot (8) in the

second workpiece (2) can be securely connected thereto,
with the lamellar part (3) in the axis of the pin-type

part (4) having a recess (5) perpendicular to the
lamellar plane, which serves for attachment to the first

workpiece (1) by means of a screw or a peg,
characterised in that
 the pin-type part (4) is moulded
onto the lamellar part (3),

and in that on its outer end face the lamellar part (3)
has the shape of a segment of a circle (9), at its end

face on the side of the pin has a projecting plane stop
(10) with a set-back shoulder (11) and towards both

tapering ends in the direction of the lamellar plane is
designed with a set-back taper (12).
A component according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the lamellar part (3) furthermore
has a rectangular shape (13) so that the cross-sectional

dimension exceeds the dimension of the stop (10) by 20 %
at most.
A component according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 on its outer end face the lamellar
part (3) has slots (14) for receiving a mechanical

screwing-in tool, which is provided with corresponding
swellings (15) to prevent lateral sliding during the

screwing-in operation. 
A component according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the pin-type part (4) takes the
form of a wood screw (16) with a conical thread for

screwing into wood, chipboard or soft plastics or dowels.
A component according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the pin-type part (4) takes the
form of a screw (17) with a cylindrical thread for

screwing into cylindrical bores in wood, chipboard or
plastics.
A component according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the pin-type part (4) has the form
of a screw (17) with a cylindrical metal thread for

screwing into threaded bushes, threaded dowels or nuts.
A component according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the pin-type part (4) takes the
form of a threaded sleeve (19) provided with an internal

thread for screwing onto screws, threaded bolts or
threaded pins.
A component according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the pin-type part (4) has the form
of a peg (20) or of a smooth tube.
A component according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that
 the lamellar part (3) comprises
lateral faces which are roughened for the purpose of

improving adhesion when gluing with the first workpiece
(1), comprise dents or raised sections or an embossed

pattern, or are constructed in any other way to enlarge
the surface. 
A screwing-in tool for a component according to one
of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that
 it consists of a cylindrical
or polyhedral shank (21) and a head (22) with a

transverse slot (23) having a circular base and
having lateral swellings (15).
A hole gauge for a component according to one of
Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that
 it consists of a body with a
U-shaped cross section with a plate-shaped circular

segment gauge, a stop part (25) for depth adjustment
and a counter-plate (26) for receiving a drill bush

(27).
