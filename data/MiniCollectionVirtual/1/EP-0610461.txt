<ABSTRACT>
The invention enables waste contaminated with potentially infectious germs from health-care institutions, such as clinics and doctors' practices, to be disposed of completely and safely yet simply and inexpensively by placing the waste in a container (1) to which ozone is fed and leaving it there, exposed to the action of the ozone, until germs are killed. Subsequently, the ozone is drawn out of the container (1) and reduced to a lower oxidation state, and the container (1) then emptied.
