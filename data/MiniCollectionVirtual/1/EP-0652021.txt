<ABSTRACT>
Micronized spray device (1) for washing nasal and 
neighboring cavities including a bell-shaped body (2) which 

forms an atomization chamber (4) on the bottom whereof there 
is a region (5) for containing a washing liquid in which a 

spray nozzle (6) draws; the spray nozzle is associated with 
a compressed-air injector (9) and is axially aligned with 

the inner outlet (10) formed by the bell-shaped body. An 
outer skirt (11) furthermore surrounds the bell-shaped body 

and forms an outer outlet (15) which is located at the inner 
outlet and forms a chamber (26) for collecting the catarrhal 

material that has been detached from the nasal cavities; the 
chamber is connected to the outside to vent the pressure 

generated during expiration. The outer skirt can be arranged 
in a first position, in which the outer outlet is spaced 

from the inner outlet so as to form an interspace (40) that 
is connected to the collection chamber, and in a second 

position, in which the outer outlet overlaps the inner 
outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a micronized spray
device particularly for washing nasal and neighboring
cavities, which in practice are the nasal fossae, the
paranasal sinuses, the rhinopharynx, the pharynx, the
auditory tube, and the middle ear.Currently there are no devices for cleansing nasal
fossae and neighboring fossae from mucopurulent secretions
or scabs.In particular, currently commercially available
inhalation-therapy devices are unable to eliminate catarrhal
secretions, since they produce a jet that is too finely
atomized owing to their particular structure, which has
obstacles, diaphragms, or bends between the pisper and the
outlet: these characteristics allow to produce a very fine
aerosol that is suitable to penetrate in the
tracheobronchial region but loses the larger water particles
that are instead useful for treating the upper respiratory
tract. EP-A-0 261 649 discloses a spray device of a similar structure as mentioned
above, comprising a body with an opening which body forms an atomization
chamber on the bottom whereof there is a region for containing a washing
liquid in which a spray nozzle draws and said spray nozzle being associated
with a compressed-air injector. A principal aim of the present invention is instead to
produce an abundant aerosol with large-diameter particles
that can penetrate directly in the nasal fossae, in the
rhinopharynx, and in the pharynx.Inhalation-therapy devices are furthermore unable to
obtain a direct effect with penetration of the water
particles in the paranasal sinuses and in the middle ear,
since they are not applied with positive pressure.An object of the present invention is instead to
produce and transmit a positive pressure from the atomizing 
chamber to the nasal fossae so that the patient can, by
swallowing, cause the micelles thus produced to penetrate in
the paranasal sinuses and in the middle ear.Another object of the invention is indeed to eliminate
the above described drawbacks by providing a micronized
spray device for washing nasal and neighboring cavities, in
which there is a micronized jet which is directed and
introduced in the nostrils without any diaphragm, obstacle,
or curve that can limit its flow-rate or vary the diameter
of the micelles as produced by the pisper, and the pressure
whereof can furthermore be discharged completely into the
nasal fossae, producing a positive-pressure space during
swallowing.Within the scope of the above specified aim, a
particular object of the invention is to provide a
micronized spray device

<CLAIMS>
Micronized spray device (1) for washing nasal and
neighboring cavities, comprising a

bell-shaped body (2) which forms an atomization chamber (4)

washing liquid in which a spray nozzle (6) draws, said spray
nozzle being associated with a compressed-air injector (9)

and being axially aligned with the inner outlet (10) formed
by said bell-shaped body, an outer skirt (11) furthermore

surrounding said bell-shaped body and forming an outer
outlet (15) at said inner outlet and a chamber (26) for

collecting the catarrhal material detached from the nasal
cavities which is connected to the outside to vent the

pressure generated during expiration, said outer skirt being
arrangeable in a first position, in which said outer outlet

is spaced from said inner outlet, forming an interspace (40)

second position, in which said outer outlet overlaps said
inner outlet.
Device according to claim 1, wherein said bell-shaped
body is sealingly detachably associable, in a

downward region, with a cap (3) to form said atomization
chamber.
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said spray nozzle (6)

comprises a cylindrical body (7) that is open towards the
bottom and has, in an upward region, a spraying hole (8)

which is located at said pressurized air injector.
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it produces in output a jet of

aqueous micelles in which a large percentage has a size
above 10 microns.
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in tha
t said outer skirt (11)
comprises a lateral body (12) that can be sealingly coupled

on the outside of said bell-shaped body (2).
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it comprises means (20,21) for

moving said outer skirt with respect to said bell-shaped
body to pass between said first position and said second

position.
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that
said movement means comprise at least one helical slot (20)

which is formed on said outer skirt and in which at least
one pin (21) engages, said pin protruding from the cap (3)
