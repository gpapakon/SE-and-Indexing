<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film
molded article and a mulitilayered
laminate
being suitably used as a retort packaging material and
excellent in tearability, rigidity, impact resitance and
heatsealability.Propylene resin is generally cheap and
excellent in characteristics such as transparency,
mechanical strength, heat resistance, gloss, chemical
resistance, oil resistance, rigidity, flex fatigue
resistance, etc., and is used in wide fields as various
industrial materials and packaging materials.When a propylene resin is molding-processed, 
its molecular chains are cooled to solidify in a
stretched state toward a machine direction (hereinafter
referred to as "M.D") by shear effects during molding-flowing,
thereby generating remarkable anisotropy in
properties. Generally, when orientation in a molded
article is high, anisotropy in properties is generated
in the molded article, whereby properties in a
transverse direction to the flow (hereinafter referred
to as "T.D") deteriorate.Moreover, sometimes, heat resistance,
weathering resistance, etc. deteriorate owing to
interior strains due to molecular orientation. In order
to improve it, various improving methods have been so
far proposed and practically applied. For example, in
extrusion molded films, there has been conducted
secondary processing in which after molding biaxially
stretched processing is conducted to keep the balance
between M.D and T.D.In injection molded articles and blow molded
articles, there has been applied a method in which after
molding a heat treatment is conducted.However, the secondary processing method for
films has such problems that not only a high cost for
the processing is necessary, but also the use is limited
since heatsealability deteriorates. The method in which after molding a heat
treatment is conducted provides complicated production
steps and consequently has problems in economy and
productivity.Hitherto, as a packaging material for articles
requiring a sterilizing treatment step, e.g, typically
processed foodstuffs, a parcel that is called "retort
pouch" has been used. In the pouch, for long term-preservation,
laminates having layers being excellent in
gas barrier property have been used.Recently, as a material of a pouch being
excellent in heat resistance, cold resistance and impact
resistance, there have been used multilayered laminates
comprising the combination of block copolymer of
polypropylene used in most inner layer, a polyester film
and an aluminum foil, e.g., layers of polyester/aluminum
foil/block
