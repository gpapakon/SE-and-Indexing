<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing an oxide superconductor
thin film of high quality
stably.Niobium nitride (NbN) and niobium germanium (Nb3Ge)
of A15 type binary compound were known as high temperature
superconductors. However, the superconducting transition
temperatures of these materials are 23 K at most. On the
other hand, perovskite structure compounds were expected to
have higher transition temperatures and high temperature
superconductors of Ba-La-Cu-O system were suggested (J.
Bednorz and K. A. Muller, Zeitschrift für Physik B-Condensed
Matter 64, 189-193 (1986)). Further, Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O
materials were found to have transition temperatures
of 100 K or more (H. Maeda, Y. Tanaka, M. Fukutomi and T.
Asano, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics 27, L209-L210
(1988), and Z. Z. Sheng and A. M. Herman, Nature 332, 55-58
(1988)). The details of the mechanism of the superconductivity
of these kinds of oxide materials are not yet clear.
However, there is a possibility that they have a transition 
temperature higher than room temperature, and applications in
electronic device area are expected with use of these
materials more than with use of the prior binary compounds.In order to use an oxide high temperature superconductor
such as Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O or Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O practically,
it is demanded to manufacture it in a form of thin film.
However, it is difficult previously to prepare a thin film
having good superconducting characteristics. It is known that
Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system has phases having different
superconducting transition temperatures, and it was very
difficult to prepare the phase itself of 100 K or more of
superconducting transition temperature in a form of thin film.Further, an insulator or a dielectric film of
thickness of a few tens nanometers is needed in order to
manufacture a periodic layered structure of superconductors
and insulators layered alternately and an integrated device
with use of such a layered structure. Especially, it is very
difficult to manufacture a periodically layered structure of
high temperature oxide superconductor films and insulator
films. In order to prepare a thin film having good
superconducting characteristics, it was necessary to conduct
heat treatment or heating process on preparation. However,
this causes mutual diffusion of atoms between the insulator
and superconductor films so as to deteriorate the characteristics
of the constituent layers. When an insulator film of for 
example Bi-W-O system is prepared by using a prior
