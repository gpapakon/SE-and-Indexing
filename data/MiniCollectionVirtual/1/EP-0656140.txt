<ABSTRACT>
Personal object to be worn by the user, especially a watch, a medal or a bracelet, including indicating means corresponding to personal medical details. The object is so designed that these confidential medical details are not visible from the exterior when the object is worn, but can be readily found and understood by the staff of rescue agencies. The details are set out in standardized form on the respective sections of an indication surface (6) which is covered by an ID tag (5), and states, in particular, the wearer's identity. Each section is covered with a removable tag portion (73). If the wearer shows symptoms indicated on one of the sections, the simply breaks the portion (73) covering that section. The existence of this risk is shown by means of a display device on the front face of the object, for example, on the watch face in the case of a watch. Complementary data can be shown by the display means and by tabs (7-10) attached to the watch bracelet (3).
