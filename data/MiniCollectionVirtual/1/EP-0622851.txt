<ABSTRACT>
A two-dimensional array (2) of imaging elements (3) is 
arranged in rows and columns. Each imaging element (3) has a two 

terminal component (40) for sensing light incident on the imaging 
element and for storing charge representing the incident light. A 

plurality of row and column conductors (5 and 6) are provided with 
one of the two terminals (4a,4b) of each component (40) in a row 

being coupled to the associated row conductor (5) and the other one 
of the two terminals (4a,4b) to the associated column conductor 

(6). Voltage signals are applied to the row and column conductors 
(5 and 6) for enabling the components (40) to sense light incident 

on the array (2) and to enable charge stored at a selected imaging 
element (3) to be sensed. The rows of imaging elements (3) are 

arranged in first and second sets (S1 and S2). A voltage signal of 
one polarity is applied to a row conductor (5) associated with the 

first set (S1) to enable charge stored at an imaging element (3) in 

the associated row (5) to be sensed. A voltage of the opposite 
polarity is applied to a row conductor (5) associated with the 

second set (S2) to enable charge stored at an imaging element (3) 
in the associated row (5) to be sensed. The leakage currents from 

rows in the first set (S1) of rows will thus be of opposite 
polarity to the leakage currents from rows in the second set (S2) 

so reducing the overall leakage current and thus the vertical 
cross-talk between rows.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image sensor, in particular an 
image sensor comprising a two-dimensional. EP-A-233104 and US Patent No. 4945242 describe image sensors 
comprising a two-dimensional array of imaging elements arranged in 
rows and columns with each imaging element comprising a two 
terminal component for sensing light incident on the imaging 
element and for storing charge representing the incident light and 
a cathode electrode, and a plurality of row and column conductors 
with one of the two terminals of each component in a row being 
coupled to the associated row conductor and the other one of the 
two terminals being coupled to the associated column conductor, and 
means for applying voltage signals to the row and column conductors 
for enabling light incident on the array to be sensed and to enable 
charge stored at a selected imaging element to be sensed. A problem with such an image sensor is that during read-out of 
the charge stored at a selected pixel or imaging element, a leakage 
current also flows in unselected pixels and so there is a high 
vertical cross-talk between pixels. One solution to this problem 
is to ensure that the image sensor is receiving no illumination 
when the charge stored at the imaging elements is being read-out. 
Where the image sensor operates by illuminating an object to be 
imaged, for example a document, this can be achieved by switching 
the illuminating light source on and off. However there are 
situations where light will inevitably be falling on the array 
during readout of the stored charge, for example when the array is 
viewing a scene rather than a document, and then illuminations 
cannot be avoided without placing a shutter or aperture in front of 
the image sensor. According to the present invention, there is provided an image 
sensor comprising a two-dimensional array of imaging elements 
arranged in rows and columns with each imaging element comprising a  
 
two terminal component for sensing light incident on the imaging 
element and for storing charge representing the incident light and 
a cathode electrode, and a plurality of row and column conductors 
with one of the two terminals of each component in a row being 
coupled to the associated row conductor and the other one of the 
two terminals being coupled to the associated column conductor, and 
means for applying voltage signals to the row and column conductors 
for enabling light incident on the array to be sensed and to enable 
charge stored at a selected imaging element to be
