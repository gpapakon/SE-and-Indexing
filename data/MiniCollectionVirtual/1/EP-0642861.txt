<ABSTRACT>
The positions of holes to be drilled along a line in a printed 
circuit board is described in binary vectors. The order of drilling is 

also described in binary vectors. The former binary vectors are made to 
correspond to the latter binary vectors through a conversion matrix where 

every partial matrix is normal. The positions of the holes are 
determined from the drilling order, or the drilling order is determined 

from the positions of the holes by the correspondence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drill apparatus for making holes 
in printed circuit boards, steel plates, plastic plates, and other plate 
materials. More specifically, the present invention relates to 
optimizing the drilling of many holes along a predetermined line. In processing printed circuit boards and other materials, a series 
of circular holes is often formed in such a way that their combination 
produces a linear long and narrow hole. For example, this method is used 
to make a hole in a printed circuit board for placing a chip. Figure 1 
shows this type or processing, wherein five round holes are formed 
continuously as shown in (b) thus to form a linear long and narrow hole 
as shown in (a). When the holes are made from 1 to 5 successively in the 
case of Figure 1, a hole on the left side is already drilled at the time 
of drilling of holes 2, 3, 4, and 5, so that the stress applied to the 
drill screw differs between the left and right side, making for a 
considerable probability of screw breakage. Since exchanging the drill 
screw requires time much larger than the time for horizontal motion, it 
is desirable to keep screw damage to the lowest extent possible. Thus, 
the drilling order must be determined so that the drill screw receives 
uniform stress at the left and right sides as much as possible. For 
example, drilling in the order of 1, 5, 3, 2 and 4 as shown in (d) and 
(e) in the example of Figure 1 is satisfactory. Determination of the 
drilling order so that uniform stress is applied at the left and right 
sides is called step drilling. Conventional step drilling, however, has been determined manually 
for the drilling order based on experience, causing a bottleneck due to 
increased working hours for the design of the drilling steps. The present invention has been made in view of the above mentioned 
circumstances and has the object of automatic determination of the order 
of drilling in step drilling.  In order to attain the above object, the present invention 
comprises describing in a binary vector fashion the positions of holes 
arranged along a line; as well as describing in a binary vector fashion 
the order of holes to be made; and making these binary vectors correspond 
by a conversion matrix in which every partial matrix is regular. On the 
basis of the correspondence, the hole position is determined by the 
drilling order, or the drilling order is determined by the hole position. An exemplary case where N holes are made along a straight line is 
discussed below.
