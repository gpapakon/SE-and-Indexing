<ABSTRACT>
On the basis of a finding that a magnetic hysteresis of a 
metal material, among magnetization characteristics changing 

with secular embrittlement of the metal material, shows 
a clear correspondence with the degree of embrittlement of 

the metal material, a change in such a magnetization characteristic 
is measured to estimate the degree of secular 

embrittlement of the metal material. In a typical embodiment, 
a superconducting quantum interference device (340) 

is used to detect the magnetization characteristic of a 
measuring object (11). According to the present invention, 

the degree of embrittlement of a metal material used in an 
environment of high temperatures can be quickly detected in 

a non-destructive fashion so that the danger of brittle 
fracture of the metal material can be reliably prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for detecting
degradation of a metal material. More particularly,
this invention relates to a degradation measuring method
and apparatus suitable for detecting embrittlement due to
high-temperature aging, of practical plant components of a
metal material such as a ferritic stainless steel used in
an environment of high temperatures such as that encountered
in a chemical plant and a nuclear power plant.Methods of measuring embrittlement of a metal material are
disclosed in, for example, JP-A-54-61981 and JP-A-61-28859.
According to one of the prior art methods disclosed in
JP-A-54-61981, a weld metal such as an austenitic stainless
steel is decided to become brittle when the amount of
δ-ferrite has decreased by more than 5 % of its initial
value. Also, according to the prior art method disclosed in
JP-A-61-28859, a change in a magnetic characteristic of a
measuring object is measured to detect degradation of the
measuring object.WO-A-8503577 describes testing ferromagnetic samples involving comparison
with a standard use of a point on the hysteresis curve
and embrittlement measurement are referred to. Further, JP-A-56-168545 discloses a method in which a magnetic
characteristic of a measuring object is utilized to
monitor the metallographic structure of the measuring object,
and JP-A-59-108970 discloses a method of detecting a
magnetic characteristic itself of a measuring object.As disclosed in JP-A-54-61981 cited above, it is already
known that aging degradation occurs on a metal material,
especially, a ferritic stainless steel, when the stainless
steel is used for a long period of time at high temperatures.
That is, at a relatively high temperature higher
than about 600 °C, σ-embrittlement attributable to precipitation
of a σ-phase occurs, while in a temperature range of
from 400 °C to 500 °C, so called 475 °C-embrittlement occurs.
However, this 475 °C-embrittlement may occur even
when the ferritic stainless steel is used for a long period
of time in a temperature range lower than 400 °C. Therefore,
it is necessary to give sufficient consideration to
the use of practical plant components of the ferritic
stainless steel at high temperatures. However, the tendency
to become brittle at temperatures lower than 500 °C was not
taken into consideration in the prior art disclosure cited
above, and the 475 °C-embrittlement could not be detected.Further, the initial amount of ferrite in practical welded
parts differs depending on the position of the welds and
tends
