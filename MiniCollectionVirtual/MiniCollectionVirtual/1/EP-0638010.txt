<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and device for the automatic assembly and working of several components (7, 8, 9), in particular vehicle-bodywork parts. A manipulator (2) controls a gripping device (3) fitted with controllable grippers (16, 17, 18) with which the gripping device automatically grips components (7, 8, 9) held ready on one or more component-readying devices (11, 12, 13) and assembles them in the required configuration to give an assembly (10). The components (7, 8, 9) gripped by the grippers are fed during and/or after assembly, depending on the required assembly order, to at least one manufacturing jig (4, 5, 6). The gripping device (3) can also feed the assembled components (7, 8, 9), maintaining their configuration, to an intermediate station (21) where it can work them using a toolholder (20).

A method for the automatic assembly and processing of a 
plurality of components (7, 8, 9) in the form of vehicle body 

parts, in a working station (1) having a manipulator (2), a 
holding device (3) guided by the manipulator, and one or more 

processing device(s) (4, 5, 6), characterized in that 

the assembly and processing procedures run in integrated 
manner in a closed working cell (1), 
the components (7, 8, 9) are supplied to one or more supply 
means (11, 12, 13) in the working cell (1), 
from where the manipulator (2) automatically takes up the 
components (7, 8, 9) individually or in groups by means of the 

holding device (3) and a plurality of independently controllable 
gripping tools (16, 17, 18), 
in the mutual association provided, the components (7, 8, 
9) are assembled to form an assembly (10) and clamped on a 

holding frame of the holding device (3), 
during and/or after assembly, according to the joining 
sequence provided, the taken-up components (7, 8, 9) are advanced 

to at least one processing procedure, and 
after completion, the manipulator (2) transfers the 
assembled assembly (10) to a discharging area (22) or to another 

manipulator. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that a 
plurality of supplied components (7, 8, 9) are taken up one after 

another and assembled in the association provided. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the components (7, 8, 9) are supplied in a stationary condition. 
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that 
the components (7, 8, 9) are supplied in a defined position.  

 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the manipulator (2) carries a processing device (5, 6), 

in which case the manipulator (2) discharges the assembled 
components (7, 8, 9) to an intermediate storage area (21) and 

then processes them at the intermediate storage area (21) itself. 
A method according to Claim 5, characterized in that, after 
processing, the manipulator (2) takes the components (7, 8, 9) 

up again by means of the holding device (3). 
A device for carrying out the method according to Claim 1 
or one of the following claims, having a manipulator (2), a 

holding device (3) and one or more processing device(s) (4, 5, 
6), the holding device (3) being arranged on the manipulator (2), 

characterized in that 

there is provided a closed working cell (1) in which the 
assembly and processing procedures run in integrated manner, 
the working cell (1) has one or more means (11, 12, 13) for 
supplying the components (7, 8, 9), 
the working cell (1) has a discharging area (22) for the 
assembled and processed assembly (10), 
the holding device (3) has a holding frame (15) for taking 
up the assembled components (7, 8, 9), 
the holding device (3) has a plurality of independently 
controllable gripping tools (16, 17, 18), and 
the gripping tools (16, 17, 18) are arranged on the holding 
frame (15) according to the assembly association provided for the 

components (7, 8, 9). 
A device according to Claim 7, characterized in that a 
processing device (5, 6) is arranged on the holding device (3). 
A device according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized in that 
the holding device (3) has a controllable tool gripping means 

(20) for taking up a processing device (5, 6). 
A device according to Claim 7, 8 or 9, characterized in that  
 

there are arranged in the working region of the manipulator (2) 
one or more means (11, 12, 13) for supplying the components (7, 

8, 9). 
A device according to Claim 10, characterized in that the 
supply means (11, 12, 13) has a positioning device (14) for the 

component(s) (7, 8, 9). 
A device according to one of Claims 7 to 11, characterized 
in that there is arranged in the working region of the 

manipulator (2) an intermediate storage area (21) for the 
assembled components (7, 8, 9).
