<DESCRIPTION>
 A BIODEGRADABLE POLYCATION COMPOSITION FOR DELIVERY OF AN ANIONIC MACROMOLECULEField of Invention:The present invention relates to a biodegradable polycation composition for delivery of an anionic macromolecule. Background:Gene therapy is a process by which genes are introduced into cells which then become mini-factories which manufacture and release essential compounds in cells and tissue which improve the life of the patient. Gene therapy has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic disorders, diseases associated with a genetic component like cancer, AIDS, and many other diseases. Gene therapy may be the only remedy for some individuals who would otherwise die or be severely disabled. Gene transfer may also be employed for systemic protein and peptide-like hormone administration. Nucleic acid sequences coding for a protein (insulin, growth hormone) would be administered to the patient allowing endogenous production of their own medication.Successful gene therapy requires the identification of an appropriate therapeutic gene for treatment of the disease, in addition to a delivery system by which that gene can be delivered to desired cell type both efficiently and accurately. Early attempts of gene transfer involved the removal of cells from the individual, and the alteration of the cells in the culture by the introduction of a functioning copy of the gene. The next step included grafting the genetically engineered cells back into the patient. This ex vivo approach to gene therapy is obviously limited to those target tissues that are not undergoing frequent multiplication and cell generation that could cause progressing elimination of the grafted cells. The ability of the altered cells to efficiently recombine with the target tissue is another limiting factor of the ex vivo approach since many cells do not exhibit the ability to recombine.The limitation and the complexity of the ex-vivo approach facilitated the development of direct in vivo gene transfer methods. Direct gene therapy involves the administration of the gene into the body, targeting of the gene to the desired cells and into the nucleus of said genes, and expression of functioning gene products therein. Currently there are two different approaches for direct gene transfer. One is a viral approach and the other is a 

non-viral approach. Viral and non-viral gene therapies differ in the methods used to deliver genes to the target cells and direct the uptake of gene into the nucleus. Viral gene therapies employ genetically
