<ABSTRACT>
Discharge-quantity controlling device in sewerage systems, in particular for connection to the discharge of a rainwater or combined-sewage tank, in the case of which control means there is provided, between an inflow connection stub and an outflow connection stub (16, 18), a float chamber (10) which is of a widened cross-section and contains a float (22) which is suspended by means of parallel linking means (26, 28) and follows the build-up, which changes in the float chamber with a variable inflow quantity, upwards or downwards. A shut-off member (44) arranged in the float chamber, behind the inflow opening (20), can be adjusted by a transition means (66, 36, 38), connected to one of the linking means (26), in order to restrict variable quantities of inflowing water to a discharge quantity which can be adjustably controlled without external energy (Figure 1).

Flow control device in sewer systems, particularly for connection to the 
outlet of a rainwater or mixed water basin, comprising a float chamber (10) 

of enlarged cross-section disposed between a feed pipe (16) and a discharge 
pipe (18) and having a bottom (30) ascending towards both sidewalls and 

including a float (22) adapted for vertical adjustment by means of parallel 
links (26, 28) supported by stationary bearings (32, 34) and adapted to adjust 

a shut-off member (44) of the feed opening (20) by means of transmission 
means driven by the link motion,
characterized in
that the float (22) is of approximately the same width as the float chamber 
(10) and has an underside conforming to the cross-sectional profile of said 

bottom (30) for being supported thereon, 
that the underside of the float (22) is upwardly curved at its central area 
above said bottom to form a through passage (58) for small non-regulated 

inflows, 
that said bottom behind the feed opening (20) is deepened with gradual 
downward slope to form a depression (67) and from the deepest point passes 

over to an upwardly inclined or curved ramp (61; 65) ending forwardly 
of the float, 
that the stationary bearings (32, 34) are disposed above the float (22) and 
in flow direction one behind the other, while the parallel links (26, 28), extend  

 
from the stationary bearings with downward inclination in flow direction, 
that the shutoff member (44) is connected to an upper elongated section 
(36) of the link (26) distal of the feed opening (20) by means of the transmission 

means forming a stiffened linkage and is of arcuate shape corresponding 
to its adjustment path about the stationary bearing (32) of this link 

(26). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the bottom (30) of the 
float chamber (10) is deepened from both sides toward its longitudinal center 

line to form a gutter. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the trailing edge of 
the ramp (65) is situated at a greater height than the lowest point of the feed 

opening (20). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the trailing edge of 
the ramp (61) is situated at the same height as the bottom of the feed 

opening (20) and joins the gutter shape of the chamber's bottom by means of 
a transition sheet (63). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the cross-section of the 
through passage (58) at least at one location is partially diminished by means 

of a restrictor sheet (59) attached to the periphery of its hollow convexity. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
lower area of the front wall of the float (22) is formed by a retracted jet  

 
receiving sheet (60) having an upper projecting area (59) acting as spray 

water guard. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 
transmission means additionally to the upper elongated section (36) of the 

link (26) distal of the feed opening comprise a motion damping member (66) 
and a connecting member (38) angularly fixed to the link and directly or indirectly 

fastened to the shut-off member. 
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the elongated section 
(36) and the connecting member (38) are joined with each other by means of 

a stiffening frame (86), which at one of its ends is connected to the link (26) 
upwardly from the stationary bearing (32) and at its other end to the shut-off 

member. 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that the stiffening frame 
(86) at its end distal of the shut-off member supports a longitudinally adjustable 

weight (70) for varying the buoyancy of the float (22). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the stationary bearings (32, 34) of the links (26, 28) as well as the transmission 

means are disposed on a support frame (88) resting on the float chamber 
(10), the support frame being adapted for upwardly pivotal movement 

about a horizontal lateral axis at the chamber's rear wall (14). 
Device according to claim 10, characterized in that a compensating 
weight (78) having respect to the transmission means is attached to the  

 
downstream link (26) near the horizontal lateral axis (82) of the support frame 

(88). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the shut-off member is a segmental plate (44), which is adjustably fastened 

to a support plate (42) including vertical slots. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the segmental plate (44) is guided between vertical sealing plates (72) consisting 

of plastic or having a low-friction coat and disposed in the float 
chamber at both sides of the feed opening (20). 
Device according to claim 13, characterized in that a sealing lip (74) 
consisting of sheet steel or of other material of reduced resiliency and forming 

an upper sealing of the feed opening is disposed between the lateral 
sealing plates (72) and at its downwardly bent free end biased to the segmental 

plate (44) to act as wiper during opening movements of the segmental 
plate.
