<ABSTRACT>
A process for fortifying an R-T-E cereal with beta carotene is provided. By adding the heat labile beta carotene to a cooked cereal mass prior to piece forming and finish drying, a beta carotene fortified R-T-E cereal is obtained which surprisingly not only has not lost significant vitamin activity, but even more surprisingly exhibits superior vitamin stability upon storage than when equivalent amounts are applied topically to the cereal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to food products and 
methods for producing them. More specifically, this 
invention relates to a vitamin enriched ready-to-eat cereal 
made by a method wherein a dry vitamin premix and beta 
carotene are homogeneously admixed into the cooked cereal 
mass before piece forming and finish drying. Breakfast cereal products are often enriched with 
vitamins. In known methods for making R-T-E cereals 
prepared from cooked cereal doughs, vitamins are generally 
applied in two separate portions. A first portion 
consisting of heat tolerant vitamins are generally 
incorporated into the cooked cereal dough. A second portion 
comprising heat sensitive or heat labile vitamins are 
generally sprayed onto the finished cereal pieces after 
pelleting, pellet shaping, drying, and toasting. In order to topically apply the heat sensitive 
vitamins, a dry premix of the heat sensitive vitamins is 
mixed into a solution and sprayed onto the cereal pieces. 
Spraying the multivitamin solution onto the cereal pieces 
after such hot process steps as drying, toasting, baking, 
etc., prevents heat sensitive vitamins from degradation 
during these hot process steps. Vitamin degradation from 
cooking steps is particularly undesirable because of the 
formation of distasteful odors and flavors as well as the 
loss of heat labile vitamin activity.  
 While effective for certain vitamin types, the 
topical application of a vitamin solution is not without 
certain disadvantages. For instance, one problem is that 
topically applied vitamins can cause an undesirable flavor 
for the cereal piece. When so applied on the surface area 
of the cereal pieces, the vitamin(s) are in direct contact 
with the cereal consumer's tongue upon consumption. With 
cereal products such as toasted flake cereal products having 
a high surface area, the amount of vitamins which come into 
contact with the consumer's tongue during consumption is 
increased. While applying a frosting to the cereal pieces 
after the vitamin solution has been sprayed onto the cereal 
pieces is helpful in masking the flavor of the vitamins, 
this process can also dilute the vitamin content present 
upon the cereal pieces. Still another problem is vitamin ingredient loss 
during application. Vitamins are very expensive 
ingredients. Unfortunately, topical vitamin application can 
involve substantial physical loss of the vitamins upon 
application since not all the spray hits the cereal but also 
coats the application vessel, transport belts, etc.

<CLAIMS>
A method for providing an R-T-E cereal product 
enriched with multivitamins and beta carotene that 

exhibits vitamin efficacy stability and improved visual 
appearance, comprising: 


A. providing a cooled cooked cereal mass having a 
moisture content of 15% to 45% and having a 

temperature of 32° to 43.3°C (90° to 110°F); 
B. thereafter uniformly dispersing beta carotene 
into said cooked cereal mass with sufficient 

simultaneous mixing to form an homogeneous 
beta carotene fortified cooked cereal mass 

composition; 
C. forming the beta carotene fortified cooked 
cereal mass into discrete pieces; 
D. finished drying the discrete pieces to form 
dried R-T-E cereal pieces having a moisture 

content of less than 5%; and, 
E. topically applying additional heat sensitive 
vitamin types to the R-T-E cereal pieces to 

form a multivitamin enriched, beta carotene 
containing
 
R-T-E cereal;
 
   wherein step B further includes dispersing a 

first multivitamin premix comprising heat tolerant 
vitamin types and wherein said cereal grain is a 

member selected from the group consisting of wheat, 
oats, rice, corn, barley, rye, sorghum, and 

mixtures of these. 
The method according to claim 1
 
   wherein said cereal grain is wheat and said 

cereal grain mass has a moisture content of between 
25% and 55% by weight. 
The method according to claim 2
 
   wherein said finishing step D comprises the  

 
substeps of 


1) forming the cooked cereal mass into cereal 
pellets, 
2) drying the cereal pellets to a moisture 
content of 15% to 22%, 
3) flaking the cereal pellets to form wet flakes, 
and 
4) toasting the wet flakes to form toasted dried 
flaked R-T-E cereal pieces having a moisture 

content of 1% to 3.5%, 
 
   wherein in step E the additional heat 

sensitive vitamins comprise vitamins A, C and D,
 
   wherein in step B, the multivitamin premix is 

in dry form,
 
   wherein the cooked cereal grain includes wheat 

and has a moisture content of 25% to 35%,
 
   wherein the cooked cereal grain includes corn, 

and
 
   wherein in step A the cooked cereal mass is 

provided by cooking a cereal grain at temperatures 
and humidities which hydrate and gelatinize cereal 

grain internal structure to form a gelatinized, wet 
cereal grain mass and subsequently tempering the 

cooked cereal mass at 101.6° to 110°C (215° to 
230°F) at 25% to 35% moisture for 6 to 12 hours. 
The method of claim 3
 
   wherein the beta carotene is in dry form. 
A vitamin fortified R-T-E cereal exhibiting 
improved vitamin stability and improved surface 

appearance comprising:
 
   an R-T-E cereal piece having an exterior 

surface fabricated from an R-T-E cooked cereal 
composition having homogeneously dispersed 

therethrough a vitamin combination comprising heat 
tolerant vitamins and beta carotene and including a 

plurality of heat sensitive vitamins topically 
applied to the exterior surface.  

 
The R-T-E cereal of claim 5
 
   wherein the beta carotene comprises 25 to 40 

mg per kilogram of the R-T-E cereal composition. 
The R-T-E cereal of claim 5 through 6
 
   wherein the heat sensitive vitamins are 

selected from the group consisting of vitamin A, 
vitamin C, vitamin D and mixtures thereof,
 
   wherein the cooked cereal composition 

comprises whole wheat, and
 
   wherein the R-T-E cereal is in a flake form 

and is toasted. 
The R-T-E cereal of claim 5 through 7
 
   wherein the R-T-E cereal is free of added 

colorants.
