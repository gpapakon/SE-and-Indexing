<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic 
compounds which are thrombin inhibitors and thus 
useful in inhibiting formation of thrombi. The heterocyclic thrombin inhibitors of the 
invention have the structure I 
including all stereoisomers thereof, and including 
all pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; 
wherein n is 0, l or 2;
 
   p is 0, l or 2;
 
   Q is a single bond or     A is aryl or cycloalkyl, or an azacycloalkyl 
ring A of 3 to 7 carbons in the ring or an 
azaheteroalkyl ring A of 4 to 6 carbons in the ring, 
as given by the structure 
   X is CH₂, O, S or NH;
 
   q = 0, l, 2, 3 or 4 if X = CH₂;
 
   q = 2, 3 or 4 if X = O, S, NH; and
 
   Y¹ and Y² are independently H, alkyl, halo or 
keto;
 
   R⁵ is guanidine, amidine or aminomethyl;
 
   R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen, lower 
alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, hydroxy, alkoxy, keto, 
thioketal, thioalkyl, thioaryl, amino or alkylamino; 
or R¹ and R² together with the carbons to which they 
are attached form a cycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl 
ring;
 
   R⁴ is hydrogen, hydroxyalkyl aminoalkyl, 
amidoalkyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, 
alkenyl, alkynyl, arylalkoxyalkyl, or an amino acid 
side chain, either protected or unprotected; and
 
   R³ is hydrogen, 
or -CO₂R⁶ (wherein R⁶ 
is lower alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or cycloheteroalkyl);
 
   with the provisos that where A is aryl or 
cycloalkyl, R⁵ is guanidine, amidine or aminomethyl;
 
 
   where A is azacycloalkyl or azaheteroalkyl, R⁵ 
is amidine;
 
   where X is a hetero atom (that is A is 
azaheteroalkyl), then there must be at least a 2-carbon 
chain between X and any N atom in the ring A 
or outside the ring A. Examples of the A ring (azacycloalkyl or 
azaheteroalkyl) which may be employed herein include 
and the like.  The term "lower alkyl" or "alkyl" as employed 
herein by itself or as part of another group includes 
both straight and branched chain radicals of up to l8 
carbons, preferably l to 8 carbons, such as methyl, 
ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, 
pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, heptyl, 4,4-dimethylpentyl, 
octyl, 2,2,4-trimethylpentyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, 
dodecyl, the various branched chain isomers thereof, 
and the like as well as such groups including l, 2 or 
3 halo substituents, an aryl substituent, an alkylaryl 
substituent, a haloaryl substituent, a cycloalkyl 
substituent, an alkylcycloalkyl substituent, an 
alkenyl substituent, an alkynyl substituent, hydroxy 
or a carboxy substituent. The term "cycloalkyl" by itself or as part of
