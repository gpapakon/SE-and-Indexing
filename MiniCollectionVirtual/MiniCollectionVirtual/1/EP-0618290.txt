<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of flow aids for
granular products which comprise a mixture of sodium
aluminosilicate and silica in a narrowly defined ratio. The
silica used is hydrophobic silica, preferably fumed
hydrophobic silica. The ratio of sodium aluminosilicate to
silica is from 100:1 to 3:1, preferably from
20:1 to 5:1, and most preferably around 10:1.The flow aid is used in the process of manufacturing high
density granular detergent components or compositions which
comprise nonionic surfactants. It is most useful in
combination with nonionic surfactants which are liquid at
ambient temperature, and are therefore mobile. Without a
suitable flow aid, the nonionic surfactant tends to leak
from the powder and soak into the cardboard container which
forms an unsightly stain. Although it is possible to avoid 
this problem by using lower levels of nonionic surfactant
in the composition, or by selecting nonionic surfactants
which have a lower solidification temperature, this limits
the flexibility of formulation.The use of flow aids in general which help to reduce the
stickiness of detergent granules comprising nonionic
surfactants, and which may help to increase bulk density is
known, for example from the following prior art:US-A-3 868 336, published on 25th February, 1975, claims
blends of detergent compositions with 0.5% to 15% by weight
of a particulate water-insoluble flow-promoting agent for
lessening, or eliminating caking, stickiness, and oiling
out when an oily liquid detergency improver is applied.
Although this patent discloses various flow-promoting
agents, it does not disclose the advantages to be gained
from mixing specific ratios of hydrophobic silica and
aluminosilicates.JP-A-61 069897, laid open 10th April, 1986 states that
aluminosilicate, silicon dioxide, bentonite and clay having
an average particle diameter of not more than 10
micrometers can be used as a surface modifier at a level of
from 0.5% to 35%.EP-A-0 351 937, published 24th January, 1990 and EP-A-0 352
135, published 24th January, 1990 disclose agglomeration
processes carried out sequentially with high speed and low
speed mixing. No finely divided particulate is present is
the granulation step. However flow aids may be used, for
example, aluminosilicates, precipitated silica and others
are suitable.EP-A-0 513 824, published 19th November, 1992, describes a
process for making nonionic detergent granules and the use 
of a surface coating having a particle size of less than 10 micrometers.EP-A-0 477 974, published
