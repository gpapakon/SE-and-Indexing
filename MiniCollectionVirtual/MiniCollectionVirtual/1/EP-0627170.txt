<ABSTRACT>
Spreadable, aerated confectionery product of the 
kind constituted by an emulsion of "water-in-oil" 

type, characterized in that the continuous oil phase 
in said emulsion is constituted by a mixture of fats, 

and the water phase in said emulsion comprises sugars 
and whey proteins, substantially in absence of casein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spreadable 
confectionery product, of creamy character in aerated 
form, suitable for being extruded for being used as a 
stuffing for cookies, or of chocolate creams. In patent literature, examples are disclosed of 
products which take advantage of the combination of 
proteins and fats in order to obtain a spreadable 
creamy structure, which may be either aerated or less. From literature references, as well as from 
operating practice, it is well known that the presence 
of even small amounts of fats annuls the capability of 
proteins of acquiring an aerated creamy structure by 
whipping. An example is given by the production of 
meringues. In order to obtain a structure like the one which 
is the object of the present invention, the use of 
milk derivatives, such as cream, cheese or condensed 
milk or fresh milk in large amounts, or of complete 
milk proteins (caseins + lactalbumins) or of casein 
alone, or salts thereof, is normally recommended. French patent 2,165,202 mentions the preparation 
of a proteinic cream based on molten cheese and one or 
more of the following ingredients: milk powder, cream, 
butter fat, casein and whey, with all of said 
ingredients being submitted to aeration under 
pressure. U.S. patent 4,623,551 discloses the preparation  
 
of a proteinic cream based on an albumin foam, the 
stabilization of which is obtained by means of the 
addition of cheese, i.e., a casein-containing product. U.S. patent 4,482,575 discloses the preparation 
of an aerated cream based on a foam of whey proteins, 
still containing mixtures of cheese powders, i.e. 
casein-containing products. U.S. patent 4,298,625 teaches the preparation of 
an aerated proteinic cream based on milk derivatives 
with a lactalbumin : casein ratio comprised within the 
range of from 1 to 2.8-3.2. U.S. patent 4,855,155 similarly teaches the 
preparation of an aerated proteinic cream based on 
fresh milk or condensed milk (therefore, still with 
casein being present), the structuring of which is 
carried out by the controlled crystallization of the 
fatty phase and pH control in order to attain precise 
modifications of proteinic fraction viscosity. U.K. patent 1,261,910 teaches the preparation of 
an aerated spreadable cream based on an emulsion 
containing milk powder or casein (also from cheese), 
or lactalbumins, the structuring of which is carried 
out by modifying the nature of the proteinic fraction 
by Lactobacillus. U.S. patent 3,851,070 teaches the preparation of 
a spreadable
