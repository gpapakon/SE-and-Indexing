<DESCRIPTION>
The Present invention relates to a rubber composition
containing a conjugated diene polymer. More specifically,
the present invention relates to a rubber composition
containing a conjugated diene polymer and a vulcanite
formed therefrom which has good breaking strength, good
wear strength, and high tanδ.Tires, high performance tires, in particular, have
been required to have good maneuverability, as the
capability of cars and highway conditions improve. Wear
strength, breaking properties, and grip properties, which
may be indicated by wear strength, stability at high speed,
accelerating capability and breaking capability are the
properties most in demand. It has been desired to improve
these properties, and, further, those which give priorities
to steering properties, good high speed stability and good
durability at high speed.To provide these rubber compositions, the relationship
between wet skid resistance or dry grip properties and
viscoelasticity of rubber compositions has been studied. 
It has been found that grip properties can be improved by
increasing hysteresis loss value, that is, by increasing
tanδ at 50 to 70 °C and by compounding large quantities of
extending oil. It has also been found that improvement in
wear strength and durability at high speed can be effected
by improving tensile strength and elongation at break, both
at high temperature, i.e., around 100 °C. In this regard,
it is known that these properties can be improved by using
an existing rubbery polymer or a novel polymer, i.e., by
adding such polymers to the tire tread compositions, to
make a novel composition.As examples of the former method, a butyl rubber, (see
JPA62-143945), a polynorbornene (see JP-A-62-143945 or see
JP-A-2-142838), a polyisoprene (see JP-A-63-132949), or a
cumarone-indene resin (see JP-A-62-1735) have been added to
a butadiene-styrene polymer (SBR). As examples of the
latter method, an SBR has been modified with a
diphenylmethyl alcohol derivative (see JP-A-60-61314), a
diblock butadiene-styrene polymer has been used as a
rubbery component (see JP-A-1-131258), an SBR has been
polymerized using an organolithium compound and certain
organic compounds such as potassium butoxide, as a rubbery
component (see JP-B-44-20463), and an SBR has been a
polymerized using a potassium salt as a randomizer as
rubbery component (see JP-A-3-239737). But, since a lot of extending oil has been used to
improve grip properties, processability was deteriorated.
So it is now required to improve both these properties and
processab
