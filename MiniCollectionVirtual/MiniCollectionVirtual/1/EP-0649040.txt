<ABSTRACT>
An optical passband filter having a frequency transition that is several of 
orders or magnitude narrower than prior optical filters includes two frequency 

routing devices of the arrayed waveguide type. 
The first frequency routing device has one input for 

receiving the input signal and at least N outputs, where N 
corresponds to the number of 

frequencies that compose the input signal. The N outputs of the first frequency 
routing device are each coupled to inputs of a second frequency routing device. 

The outputs of the second frequency device each correspond to one of the 
selected output frequency bands into which the input signal is to be divided. A 

multiplexed input signal containing several different frequency channels is 
divided into bands that are each directed to respective outputs of the second 

frequency routing device. The frequency transition between the various bands 
may be as small s the frequency resolution between adjacent outputs of the first 

frequency routing device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical communications systems. More
particularly, this invention relates to optical passband filters used in optical
communications systems.The capacity and speed of communications systems may be increased by
transmitting information in optical form over networks composed of optically
transmissive nodes, fibers, and the like. High capacity optical communications
systems require that many optical signals be frequency division multiplexed in 
the components of an optical network. Receivers must be configured such that a
desired optical frequency or band of frequencies may be retrieved from a group
of many optical frequencies. This necessitates the provision of suitable optical
filters such as an optical passband filter for dividing a multiplexed signal
composed of a large band of frequencies into one or more sub-bands of
frequencies. Until now, there has been no convenient approach to dividing a
band of optical frequencies while providing a sharp transition between the pass
band and the stop band. The performance of prior optical passband filters has
been limited because of the relatively large frequency transition between the
pass and stop bands.US-A-4 483 582 discloses a multiwavelength multiplexer-demultiplexer
constructed from units each capable of multiplexing or demultiplexing two
wavelengths. As many such units as required can be interconnected to form
multiplexer-demultiplexers of any number of wavelengths. Each two-wavelength
multiplexer-demultiplexer unit includes a four-port power divider, a four-port phase
shifter having two ports connected to two ports of the power divider, and another four-port
power divider having two ports connected to two ports of the phase shifter. The
power divider may be a single-mode optical fiber directional coupler, or a half-silvered
mirror beam splitter. The phase shifter may include a pair of single mode optical fibers
or a pair of oppositely disposed mirrors.US-A-4 723 829 discloses a device for separating radiation beams of
different wavelengths, which emerge from an optical fiber. The device includes a
reflection grating and a wavelength-selective mirror. The wavelength-selective mirror
is arranged between the optical fiber and the reflection grating. The mirror reflects
radiation beams of wavelengths which are spaced comparatively far from the
wavelengths of the radiation beams of comparatively closely spaced wavelengths. The
reflected beam is reflected to an output fiber. The mirror transmits the radiation beams
of comparatively
