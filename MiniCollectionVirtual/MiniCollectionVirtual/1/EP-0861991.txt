<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is intended to provide a pressed
retainer which can meet requirements for operation at high

temperature and high speed, can sufficiently retain lubricant,
does not allow ceramic balls, if used, to cut away track

surfaces and is superior in wear resistance, and also intended
to provide a ball bearing comprising the pressed retainer.
In order to solve problems, in the pressed retainer (1), wherein
two ring-shaped retainer plates (2), having ball retaining portions (3)

and flat portions (4) at predetermined intervals in the
circumferential direction thereof, are combined to face with

each other so as to form pockets (6) for accommodating balls (5), a
first spherical concave portion (3a) and a second spherical concave

portion (3b) having a curvature radius smaller than that of the first
spherical concave portion (3a) are formed at the ball retaining

portions (3), and a nitrided layer (2n) is formed on the surfaces of the
ring-shaped retainer plates (2). The ball bearing of the present

invention uses the pressed retainer (1) and ceramic balls (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressed retainer and
a ball bearing comprising the pressed retainer, more
particularly to a pressed retainer and a ball bearing comprising
the pressed retainer structured so as to be unlikely to seize
even when used in areas where lubrication conditions are strict,
such as the crankshaft of a two-cycle engine.A pressed retainer for a conventional ball bearing is
produced as described below. As shown in FIG. 6 for example,
two ring-shaped retainer plates 52, 52 provided with ball
retaining portions 53, 53, ... disposed at equal intervals in
the circumferential direction are faced to each other so that
two mating ball holding portions, that is, one ball holding
portion 53 and the other ball holding portion 53 form a pocket
56, and flat portions (joint portions) 54, 54 are joined and
secured with rivets 7. A corrugated retainer 51 for this ball
bearing, with balls disposed in the pockets 56, is disposed in a
ring-shaped space between the inner and outer races (not shown)
of the ball bearing.FIG. 7A is a sectional plan view showing the pressed
retainer 51 for the above-mentioned conventional ball bearing, 
taken in the circumferential direction of the pitch circle of
the bearing. In this kind of ball bearing, when its race (inner
race or outer race) rotates relatively, both the balls 5 and the
retainer 51 rotate simultaneously(around the race). However, the
ball 5 rotates around the race and also rotates on its axis
while making contact with the forward surface in the rotation
direction (advancing direction) and the inner wall surfaces of
the pocket 56. In other words, when the pressed retainer 51
rotates around the race, the ball 5 makes contact with the inner
wall surfaces 56a, 56b of the pocket 56 of the pressed retainer
51 in the advancing direction while rotating on its axis Z. The
shapes of the contact areas of the inner wall surfaces 56a, 56b
are shown in FIG. 7B as viewed from arrowed line A-A of FIG. 7A.Recently, ball bearings comprising ceramic balls being
usable in strict environmental conditions (temperature is high,
high strength is required, lubrication is insufficient, and the
like), have begun to be used. Such ceramic balls have begun
to be used in some areas wherein the use of ordinary bearings
is difficult, for example, in areas wherein heat resistance,
strength, high speed resistance, insulation, etc. are required,
because the ceramic balls are superior in light weight, heat
resistance, high hardness, low coefficient of linear expansion,
corrosion

A pressed retainer (1), wherein two ring-shaped retainer
plates (2), having ball retaining portions (3) expanded outward and

flat portions (4) at predetermined intervals in the circumferential
direction thereof, are combined so that each mating pair of said
