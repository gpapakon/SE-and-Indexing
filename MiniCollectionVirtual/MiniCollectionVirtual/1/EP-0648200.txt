<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an isoparaffin-olefin 
alkylation process. As a result of the curtailment in the use of 
tetraethyl lead as an octane-improving additive for 
gasoline, not only has the production of unleaded 
gasoline increased but the octane number specification 
of all grades of gasoline has increased as well. 
Isoparaffin-olefin alkylation is a key route to the 
production of highly branched paraffin octane 
enhancers which are to be blended into gasolines. Alkylation involves the addition of an alkyl 
group to an organic molecule. Thus, an isoparaffin 
can be reacted with an olefin to provide an 
isoparaffin of higher molecular weight. Industrially, 
alkylation often involves the reaction of C2-C5 
olefins with isobutane in the presence of an acidic 
catalyst. Alkylates are valuable blending components 
for the manufacture of premium gasolines because they 
possess both high research and motor octane (low 
sensitivity) numbers, contain no olefins or aromatics 
and little or no sulfur, demonstrate excellent 
stability and are clean burning. Alkylates typically 
comprise 10-15% of the gasoline pool. In the past, alkylation processes have included 
the use of hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid as 
catalysts under controlled temperature conditions. 
Low temperatures are utilized in the sulfuric acid 
process to minimize the undesirable side reaction of 
olefin polymerization and the acid strength is 
generally maintained at 88-94 percent by the 
continuous addition of fresh acid and the continuous 
withdrawal of spent acid. The hydrofluoric acid 
process is less temperature-sensitive and the acid is 
easily recovered and purified.  
 The typical types of alkylation currently used to 
produce high octane gasoline blending components, that 
is, the hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid alkylation 
processes, have inherent drawbacks including 
environmental concerns, acid consumption and disposal 
of corrosive materials. With the increasing demands 
for octane and increasing environmental concerns, it 
is desirable to develop an alkylation process based on 
a solid catalyst system. Crystalline metallosilicates, or zeolites, have 
been widely investigated for use in the catalysis of 
isoparaffin alkylation. For example, U.S. Patent No. 
3,251,902 describes the use of a fixed bed of 
ion-exchanged crystalline aluminosilicate having a 
reduced number of available acid sites for the liquid 
phase alkylation of C4-C20 branched-chain paraffins 
with C2-C12 olefins in which the molar ratio of 
isop

A process for isoparaffin-olefin alkylation which 
comprises the steps of: 


(a) introducing into a reactor fluidizable solid 
acid zeolite catalyst particles whose 

largest dimension ranges from 20-2000 
µ; 
(b) introducing into the reactor a feed of 
liquid reactants comprising an isoparaffin 

and an olefin at a first isoparaffin to 
olefin molar ratio greater than 1; 
(c) forming a slurry of said catalyst particles 
and said feed and circulating said slurry 

within the reactor such that the isoparaffin 
reacts with the olefin to produce alkylate 

product and the isoparaffin to olefin molar 
ratio of the slurry increases to a value in 

excess of said first ratio; 
(d) removing a first portion of said slurry from 
the reactor and recycling said first portion 

to mix with the feed and provide an 
isoparaffin to olefin molar ratio in the 

reactor of at least 500; 
(e) removing a second portion of the slurry from 
the reactor and passing said second portion 

to a separating means to separate alkylate 
product from the solid catalyst particles; 

and; 
(f) regenerating the separated catalyst 
particles and recycling the regenerated 

catalyst particles to the reactor. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said reactants are 
separated from said second portion of the slurry 

and recycled to mix with the feed. 
The process of claim 2 wherein said reactants 
separated from said second portion of the slurry 

are recycled to mix with the feed prior to 
introduction of the feed into the reactor. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said reactor 
comprises a draft tube open at both ends and 

wherein said first portion of said slurry is 
taken from outside of said draft tube. 
The process of claim 4 wherein said feed is 
conveyed into said reactor through atomizing 

nozzles disposed within said draft tube. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said slurry has a 
solids content ranging from 2 to 40 volume 

percent, said catalyst particles largest 
dimension ranges from 50 to 200 µ, said 

recycling of first portion of said slurry 
provides an isoparaffin to olefin molar ratio in 

the reactor of at least 1000, and said recycle is 
injected into the reactor at a velocity of at 

least 15 m/s (50 feet per second).  
 
The process of claim 1 wherein said slurry has a 
solids content ranging from 6 to 30 volume 

percent, said recycling of first portion of said 
slurry provides an isoparaffin to olefin molar 

ratio in the reactor of at least 3000, and said 
recycle is injected into the reactor at a 

velocity of at least 30 m/s (100 feet per

The process of claim 1 wherein said slurry is 
recycled at a rate of at least 1 volume percent 

of said total reactor volume per minute. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said slurry is 
recycled at a rate of 5 to 60 volume percent of 

said total reactor volume per minute. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the alkylation
