<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating an ink jet print head jetting ink though 
a ink jet nozzle (31) by pressurizing ink supplied to a pressure chamber 

(34) from a ink supplying portion, comprises the steps of: 

(a) applying flowable resin on a surface of a piezoelectric 
member (21) polarized in a thickness direction; 
(b) forming a low rigidity member (22) having a rigidity less than 
that of said piezoelectric member by curing the resin; 
(c) grinding a surface of said low rigidity member (22); 
(d) forming a plurality of grooves (23) extending from the surface 
of the low rigidity member (22) to an inside of said piezoelectric 

member (21); 
(e) forming electrodes (28) on entire inner surface of 
said grooves (23); 

and 
(f) sticking a top plate (30) to the ground surface to 
close an opening 

of the grooves (23), thereby forming the plurality of pressure chambers 
(34) communicating with the ink supplying portion and the 

ink jet nozzle (31). 
In this method, even if resin is cured and contracted, since the 
low rigidity member (22) is formed by curing the resin at (b) process and 

the surface of the low rigidity member (22) is ground at (c) process, the 
proportion of the height of the low rigidity member (22) and the 

piezoelectric member (21) is equalized. Consequently, coefficient and 
stability are improved in the jetting characteristics of ink.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of fabricating an on-demand 
ink jet print head, and more particularly to a method of fabricating 
an ink jet print head in which a low-rigidity member having a 
rigidity lower than that of a piezoelectric member constitutes a part 
of a side wall of a pressure chamber. Conventional ink jet print heads are disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Laid Open No. Hei 5-64893 and Japanese Patent Laid Open No. Hei 
5-96727 (EP-A-0 535 772). The structure of the ink jet print head will be described 
hereinafter in a fabricating process order, following which the 
operation thereof will be described. First, as shown in Fig. 6 (A), a predetermined gap is produced 
between a base plate 1 such as a glass and a piezoelectric member 2 
which is polarized in thickness direction, and adhesive is filled up 
between the base plate 1 and the piezoelectric member 2, after that 
the adhesive is cured to form an adhesive layer 3 between the base 
plate 1 and the piezoelectric member 2. Next, as shown in Fig. 6 (B), a plurality of grooves 4 are cut in 
the surface of the piezoelectric member 2 so that the grooves 4 extend 
into the adhesive layer 3 and side walls 5 are formed on both sides of 
the grooves 4. Then, electrodes 6 are formed on an inner surface of 
the grooves 4. Further, as shown in Fig. 6 (C), a top plate 7 is stuck to the 
surface of the piezoelectric member 2. The top plate 7 includes a ink 
supplying groove 9 (see Fig. 7) formed therein. Through this  
 
process, the upper openings of the grooves 4 are closed by the top 
plate 7, so that the side walls 5 and top plate 7 define a plurality of 
pressure chambers 8. After that, as shown in Fig. 7, an orifice plate 11 is stuck to the 
sides of the base plate 1, adhesive layer 3 and piezoelectric member 2. 
An orifice plate 11 is provided with a plurality of orifices 10 each of 
which serves as ink jet nozzle. Thus, the ink jet print head is 
completed. Next, operation of the ink jet print head thus constructed will 
be described hereinafter. Fig. 8 is a cross sectional view showing a 
part of the ink jet print head. In Fig. 8, a central pressure chamber is 
designated by reference numeral 8b, a left side pressure chamber by 
reference numeral 8a, and a right side pressure chamber by reference 
numeral 8c. An example of operation in jetting the ink from the 
central pressure chamber 8b will be described. Electric fields are generated on the side walls 5 between the 
central pressure chamber 8b and the left pressure chamber 8a and the 
sid
