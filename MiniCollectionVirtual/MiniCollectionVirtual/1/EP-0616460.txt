Prepayment or postpayment telephone apparatus made available to the
public comprising a control circuit (10) connected to a telephone line (20),


characterized in that
 it comprises:

a connector (15) accessible to the user,
a circuit (16) controlling said connector (15),
a switching circuit (22) making it possible to switch the line (20)
either to the control circuit of said apparatus (10) or to the control

circuit (16) of the connector (15),
an information circuit (12) of a connection of an external terminal in
the connector (15),
the connector control circuit being connected on the one hand to the
switching circuit (22) by a first electrical insulation module (21) and

on the other to the control circuit of said apparatus (10) by a second
electrical insulation module (19).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a
power supply circuit for the external terminal.
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the power supply
circuit (17) is within the public telephone and is connected to the control

circuit of the connector (16) across a third electrical insulation module (18).
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the power supply
circuit is an external box (34), which can be placed between the external

terminal (14) and the connector (15).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the information
circu
it of a connection is a current detector circuit.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the information circuit
of a connection is an external switch (26), which can be manipulated by the user.
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that

the electrical insulation modules (18, 19, 21) in each case comprise a
transformer.
Device according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 it comprises an a.c. 
power supply (17) connected to a current regulating circuit (25) across

a transformer (18) and a diode bridge (24), said regulator having its
output inserted between two windings of the transformer constituting

the first electrical insulation module.
Device according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the current regulating
circuit comprises a transistor (T1), two resistors (R1,R2) and a

diode (D3), a first capacitor (C1) making it possible to loop the alternating
current and a second capacitor (C2) making it possible to smooth

the direct current.
