<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an irrigant for use in dental surgical procedures, the irrigant comprising an electrolytically activated aqueous solution, characterised in having a pH of between 6.75 and 10 with microcidal as well as anti-oxidising, dispersing and surfactant properties, rendering the irrigant bio-compatible and non-corrosive. The invention further relates to the use of an irrigant in dental surgical procedures, a method for irrigating dental surgical procedures, and a coolant for dental surgical rotary instruments when used in dental surgical procedures, including procedures such as the surgical removal of teeth, the treatment of alveolar osteitis, periodontal surgical procedures involving alveolar bone and first stage implant treatment surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE: A COOLANT AND IRRIGANT FOR USE IN DENTAL SURGERYINTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a coolant and irrigant for use in periodontal andsurgical procedures involving alveolar bone, in surgical removal of teeth, duringfirst stage implant surgery and in the treatment of post-extraction alveolarosteitis, as well as to a method for such surgical procedures, using such coolantand irrigant.Simple extraction is the preferred, easy method of removal of teeth. In certaincases, such as impacted teeth, fractured teeth, or ankylosed teeth this is notpossible and it is then necessary to surgically remove these teeth. Surgeryincludes the steps of the incision of the periodontal tissues and periosteum; the reflection of a full thickness flap (of periodontium and periosteum); the removalof the overlying bone by means of motor or turbine driven rotary instruments;and the elevating of the tooth or root. The process is completed with theappositioning and suturing of the soft tissues.This procedure is typically followed by intense pain and swelling. The pain andswelling quite often lead to many days of bed rest and loss of productivity.One of the most common complications following the extraction of teeth is theinfection of the tooth socket, commonly referred to as "dry socket". This 

condition is also known as alveolar osteitis, alveolitis sicca dolorosa, alveolalgia,postoperative osteϊtis or localised acute alveolar osteomyelitis.In this condition, the blood clot covering the alveoli disintegrates or disappears,with the subsequent release of a foul odour and severe pain, but nosuppuration. The exact cause of "dry socket" is not known. The nature of thepain is quite severe and healing is relatively slow. There is no standard regimenof treatment for the condition. Many modalities and medicines have beensuggested but there had been, until now, no satisfactory method or agent fortreatment of post-extraction alveolar osteϊtis.In certain cases of advanced adult periodontitis surgical treatment isindicated. Such surgical treatment usually involves incision of theperiodontal and mucosal tissues, reflection of a full thickness flap, resectionand contouring of the alveolar bone, appositioning of the flap and suturingof the wound. Resection and contouring of the bone, when done by meansof motor or turbine driven rotary instruments such as dental drills mustalways be accompanied by copious cooling and irrigation with sterile wateror saline. Failure to do so will result in necrosis of bone,

CLAIMS
1. An irrigant for use in dental surgical procedures, the irrigant comprising
an electrolytically activated aqueous solution, the solution being
characterised in having a pH of between 6.75 and 10 with microcidal
as well as anti-oxidising, dispersing and surfactant properties,
rendering the irrigant bio-compatible and non-corrosive.
2. An irrigant as claimed in claim 1 , characterised in being selected from
the group consisting of a mixture of an anion-containing solution and a
cation-containing solution; an anion-containing solution, having been
generated from a cation-containing solution or a mixture of an anion-
containing solution and a cation-containing solution; and a cation-
containing solution, having been generated from an anion-containing
solution, a cation-containing solution or a mixture of an anion-
containing solution and a cation-containing solution.

mixture of electrolytically activated, anion-containing solution and
electrolytically activated, cation-containing solution in the proportions
and the state as generated by a electrolytic device, capable of
producing separate electrolytically activated, anion-containing and 


 electrolytically activated, cation-containing solutions, the irrigant consisting of a mixture in a ratio of about 4 to 5 volumes of the electrolytically activated, anion-containing solution to about 1 volume of the electrolytically activated, cation-containing solution, when prepared from an aqueous solution of a chloride or halide salt.
4. An irrigant as claimed in claim 2, characterised in consisting of a mixture of electrolytically activated, anion-containing solution and electrolytically activated, cation-containing solution in the proportions and the state as generated by a electrolytic device, capable of producing separate electrolytically activated, anion-containing and electrolytically activated, cation-containing solutions, the irrigant consisting of a mixture in a ratio of about 2 to 3 volumes of the electrolytically activated, anion-containing solution to about 1 volume of the electrolytically activated, cation-containing solution, when prepared from an aqueous solution of a bicarbonate or carbonate salt .
5. An irrigant as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterised in having been produced by means of electrolysis of a dilute saline solution of about 0,01 % to 1 %, thus minimising the formation of trihalomethanes and therefore the carcinogenic potential of the solution.
