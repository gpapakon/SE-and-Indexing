<ABSTRACT>
The resistive element (1) includes a central segment (2) of constant cross-section and two terminal parts (3, 4) made of copper brazed on to the central segment along two junctions (6, 7) transversal to the direction of passage of the current, equipped with lugs (8, 9) constituting the means for series connection, the said central segment (2) being made of a material having a resistivity higher than that of the copper by at least one order of magnitude, and exhibiting a resistivity variation as a function of temperature not exceeding 25 ppm/@C, at least between -20@C and +80@C. Use especially in electrical energy meters for distribution mains.

A current measuring shunt element (1) including 
means for connection in series with a load and means for 

taking a potential difference representative of the 
resistive voltage drop within the element,
 
   characterized in that it comprises a middle length 

(2) of constant cross-section and two end portions (3,4) of 
electrically conductive material brazed at both ends of said 

middle length along two junctions (6,7) extending 
transversely to the current flow direction, said end 

portions being provided with tabs (8,9) constituting the 
serial connection means, said middle length (2) being made 

of a material of resistivity that is greater by at least one 
order of magnitude than the resistivity of the material 

constituting the end portions, and presenting variation in 
its resistivity as a function of temperature that does not 

exceed 25 ppm/°C, at least in the range -20°C to +80°C. 
A shunt element according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the middle length (2) is made of an 

alloy constituted by 4% nickel, 10% manganese, and 86% 
copper, by weight. 
A shunt element according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the means for taking the potential 

difference are constituted by two holes (11,12) formed 
respectively in the middle length (2) close to the two end 

portions (3,4) and designed to receive terminal pins (13,14) 
of measurement wires (16,17). 
A shunt element according to claim 3, 
characterized in that it includes another hole (18) formed 

in the middle length (2) close to one of the end portions 
(3) and designed to receive a terminal pin (19) of a 

reference wire (21) for providing a reference potential. 
A shunt element according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that said holes (11,12,18) are at least 

partially situated at the transverse junctions (6,7). 
A connection and measurement module including  
 

connection means for connecting a live wire (P) and a 
neutral wire (N) of a single phase electricity distribution 

network to two respective power supply wires (AP,AN) for 
electrical installations situated downstream from the 

module, characterized in that the connection means include 
a current measuring shunt element (1) according to an
y one 
of claims 1 to 5 and disposed to be put into contact via one 

of its tabs (8) with the live wire (P) and via its other tab 
(9) with the corresponding power supply wire (AP). 
A connection module according to claim 6, 
characterized in that the current measuring shunt element 

(1) includes a hole (18) formed through the middle length 
(2) close to one of the end portions (3) and designed to 

receive a reference wire (21) for providing a reference 
potential, and in that it further includes a conductive 

strap (33) having two tabs (34,35) disposed so as to be put 
into contact respectively with the neutral wire (N) and with 

the corresponding power supply wire (AN), said strap 
including means for connection to a voltage taking wire (38) 

that provides a voltage relative to the reference wire (21) 
that is representative of the voltage applied to the load.
