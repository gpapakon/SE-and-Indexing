<ABSTRACT>
A switch mounted on the push rod of a master cylinder assembly and controlling in sequence several switches such, for example, as a cruise control switch, an electronic fuel injection switch, and a start interlock switch. The switch includes a hollow housing defining a central chamber through which the push rod passes and a plunger assembly carried by the push rod and mounted for axial movement within the chamber. The plunger assembly includes a primary plunger and a secondary plunger carried by and movable axially relative to the primary plunger. The initial portion of the forward movement of the push rod allows incremental forward movement of the secondary plunger to actuate a first series of switches whereafter the push rod moves further forwardly without either plunger whereafter the push rod engages the primary plunger to move the plunger assembly forwardly to actuate a further switch. The lost or relative movement between the push rod and the plunger assembly allows the switch housing to be significantly shortened and thereby allows the switch to be utilized on relatively short push rods.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a switch assembly according to the preamble of claim 1
operated by the input member of a hydraulic master cylinder
assembly, such as the master cylinder of a motor vehicle
clutch hydraulic control system or the master cylinder of
a motor vehicle hydraulic brake system.It has become general practice in the automobile
industry to interlock the operation of the engine starter
motor with other controls of the motor vehicle such that
the starter member is rendered inoperative unless the
transmission is in neutral or park in motor vehicles
provided with an automatic transmission or, in motor
vehicles provided with a foot operated clutch and a
manually operated gear shift transmission, unless the
transmission is in neutral and/or the clutch pedal is fully
depressed, to fully release the clutch. In addition, it is
convenient in a motor vehicle provided with a cruise
control and a mechanical clutch to shut off the operation
of the cruise control upon, for example, downshifting which
in turn requires release of the clutch. However, it is
necessary that the cruise control be disconnected even
before the clutch is fully released to enable the driver to
cut off the cruise control by a slight foot tap on the
clutch pedal. It is also desirable to actuate the
electronic fuel control (EFI) of the motor vehicle in
response to the initial depressing movement of the clutch. Many switch arrangements have been provided for
use in association with the master cylinder assembly to
accomplish the various desired switching operations as the
clutch pedal is depressed. Examples of such switches are
shown, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4878041 (closest prior art), 4719444,
and 4649238. The switch devices shown in these
prior art patents are all of the type in which the switch
mounts on the push rod of the master cylinder assembly and
in which the switch includes a plurality of axially spaced
switches which can be sequentially actuated in response to
depression of the clutch to generate a sequential series of
control signals with respect to cruise control, EFI
interlock, etc. Whereas these prior art switches have
proven to be generally satisfactory, generating the
required control signals in response to depression of the
clutch, the sequential arrangement of the various switches
along the length of the switch results in a relatively long
switch assembly which is incompatible with the relatively
short push rods that are found in many present day motor
vehicles.This invention is directed to the provision of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A switch assembly (22) comprising a hollow switch
housing (24) defining axially spaced first and second

switch means (27,28,29), and a plunger assembly (25)
mounted for sliding movement in the housing in

response to movement of a push rod (20) in a first
direction to sequentially coact with the housing

switch means (27,28,29) to actuate the switch means to
generate sequential first and second control signals,

the switch assembly being characterized in that:

in the initial increment of movement of the push rod
(20) in the first direction the plunger assembly acts

to actuate the first switch means (27,28);
in the second increment of movement of the push rod in
the first direction the push rod (27) moves relative

to the plunger assembly (25); and
in the third increment of movement of the push rod in
the first direction the plunger assembly moves

with the push rod to actuate the second switch means
(29).
A switch assembly according to claim 1 characterised in
that the plunger assembly (25) includes a first plunger

member (32) and a second plunger member (34) mounted on
the first plunger member and axially movable relative

to the first plunger member; and

the actuation of the first switch means (27,28) upon
the initial increment of movement of the push rod (20) 

in the first direction comprises movement of the
second plunger member (34) with the push rod and

relative to the first plunger member (32).
A switch assembly according to claim 2 characterised in
that the first switch means (27,28) is spring biased to

a first position and movable against the resistance of
the spring bias to a second position;


with the push rod (20) in a fully extended position
prior to movement in the first direction the second

plunger member (34) maintains the first switch means
in its second position; and
as the push rod (20) undergoes its initial increment of
movement in the first direction it releases the second

plunger member (34) and allows it to move in the first
direction with the push rod to allow the first switch

means (27,28) to move to its first position under the
spring bias of the switch.
A switch assembly according to claim 3 characterised in
that the push rod (20) defines first and second axially

spaced radially extending actuating surfaces (40,20b);
with the push rod in its fully extended position the

first actuating surface (40) precludes movement of the
second plunger member (34) in the first direction so as

to maintain the first switch means (27,28) in its
second position; and

the second actuating surface (20b) engages the plunger 
assembly (34) as the push rod begins its third

increment of movement.
A switch assembly according to claim 4 characterised in
that the first actuating surface (40) coacts with a

first surface (34c) on the second plunger member (34);
the second actuating suface (20b) coacts with a second

surface (32b) on the first plunger member (32); and
the actuating surfaces (40,20b) are spaced axially by a

distance greater than the axial distance between the
first and second surfaces (34c,32b) on the plunger

that the first and second actuating surfaces comprise

first and second annular shoulder surfaces (40,20b) on
the push rod (20).
A switch assembly according to claim 6 characterised in

that one of said annular shoulders comprises a shoulder
(20b) formed at the junction of a large diameter

portion (20c) of the push rod (20) with a reduced
diameter portion (20a) of the push rod and the other 

annular shoulder is defined by a ring (40) fixedly
positioned on the reduced diameter push rod portion

(20a).
A switch assembly according to claim 1 characterised in
that the hollow switch housing includes a first end

wall (24c) and an annular interior surface (24j)
extending in said first direction away from the first

end wall and in surrounding relation to the central
