<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for creating a false color image, by utilizing a video camera provided with two or three arrays of semiconductor detectors (2, 13), the sensitivity range whereof, in relation to wavelength, extends from the visible light range to near infrared radiation range, and where the radiation received in the semiconductor detectors is filtered. According to the invention, the radiation received in the first array (2) of semiconductor detectors is filtered so that only near infrared radiation (ir) is given access to the detector array. Further, the radiation received in the second semiconductor detector array (13), or alternatively in the second and third semiconductor detector arrays (3, 4) is filtered so that, of the radiation of the visible spectrum range, green (g) and red (r) are given access to the detector array (13) or arrays (3, 4). The signals (ir, g, r) obtained from the first and second semiconductor detector arrays (2, 13), or alternatively from the second and third semiconductor detector arrays (3, 4) and representing the strength of near infrared radiation (ir) and the strength of the radiation of the green (g) and red (r) spectrum ranges, are decoded by changing the order of the signals in order to achieve a desired false colour signal (g, r, ir) in the camera output (10, 11, 12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the methods of the 
introductory sections of patent claims 1 and 2 for 
producing false color images. The invention also relates 
to apparatuses applying the said methods for producing 
false color images. Semiconductor video cameras include a number 
of semiconductor detectors, generally silicon-based 
detectors, which are arranged in line form or in matrix 
form. In addition, these detectors are generally coupled 
as CCD-detectors. Such CCD-detectors are sensitive 
for both visible light and near infrared radiation, as 
is illustrated in figure 1. In color video cameras 
based on semiconductors, there are generally two or 
three arrays of CCD-detectors, the first array whereof 
is used for detecting blue color B, and the second for 
detecting combined green G and red R, or alternatively 
only green color G, in which case red color R is detected 
by means of the third array. The spectrum ranges 
of different colors with respect to wavelength are 
illustrated in figure 1. In ordinary video cameras, the access of near 
infrared radiation to the detectors is prevented by 
placing a filter cutting off near infrared radiation in 
front of the said detectors. The colors of the drawing, 
i.e. blue, green and red, are separated by means 
of another set of filters provided in front of the 
different detector arrays. From the Finnish patent publication FI-A-79,641, 
there is known a method and apparatus for producing 
a false color image. In the invention described 
in the said patent publication, the false color image 
is created so that from two channels, i.e. detector 
arrays, the effect of near infrared radiation was electrically 
reduced, whereafter the signals R, G, B representing 
various colors were coded, and a video image  
 
resembling a false color image was created. Similarly, WO-A-89/12941 discloses separating light into R,G,B components which still may comprise near infrared light. The blue light is filtered to pass only the infrared portion therein. R+IR, G+IR, IR light is thus detected and R,G,IR component data calculated therefrom. A drawback with the known methods and apparatuses 
is, that the video signal is electrically processed for 
several times, which weakens the image quality. Another 
drawback of the prior art is that this kind of 
electrical arrangement for producing a false color 
image uses a relatively high amount of electric power, 
which is an obvious disadvantage for instance while 
surveying the surroundings with a false color camera 
from an aeroplane.
