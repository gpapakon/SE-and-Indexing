<ABSTRACT>
Dental X-ray films for the direct absorption 
of x-radiation are disclosed in which silver halide 

emulsion layers are coated on the opposite faces a 
transparent film support. To achieve direct absorption 

of X-radiation with the low image noise levels required 
for dental diagnostics while enhancing image invariance 

as a function of processing solution seasoning silver 
halide grains containing less than 5 mole percent 

iodide, based on silver, forming the emulsion layers 
are coated on each face of the support at a coverage of 

greater than 7.5 g/m², greater than 75 percent of total 
grain projected area being accounted for by tabular 

grains having an average equivalent circular diameter 
of less than 5.0 µm, an average thickness of less than 

0.36 µm, and an average aspect ratio of at least 5.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to silver halide 
radiographic elements particularly adapted for use in 
dental diagnostic imaging. In less than one year after the discovery of 
X-radiation by Roentgen in 1914 silver halide emulsions 
were being used in radiographic medical diagnostic 
film. It was recognized almost from the very outset 
that the high energy ionizing X-radiation was potentially 
harmful, and ways were sought to avoid high 
levels of patient exposure. One approach, still in wide-spread use was to 
coat the silver halide emulsions on the opposite faces 
of the film support. It was recognized that a silver 
halide emulsion layer absorbs only about 1 percent of 
the X-radiation it receives. By coating a second emulsion 
layer on the back side of the support X-radiation 
absorption can be doubled. Dual-coated radiographic 
films are sold by Eastman Kodak Company under the 
trademark "Duplitized". A second approach for X-ray dosage reduction 
that is compatible with the first approach is to 
rely on a phosphor containing X-ray intensifying screen 
to absorb X-radiation and to emit light that exposes 
the silver halide emulsion of the radiographic element. 
X-ray intensifying screens are approximately 20 times 
more efficient in capturing X-radiation than silver 
halide emulsions. In 1918 the Eastman Kodak Company 
introduced the first medical radiographic product that 
was dual coated, and the Patterson Screen Company that 
same year introduced a matched intensifying screen pair 
for that product. As would be expected, indirect radiographic 
films, those in which an intensifying screen is relied 
upon to capture X-radiation and to emit light that 
exposes the film, are fundamentally different in their  
 
construction from direct radiographic films, in which 
imaging depends on the silver halide grains to absorb 
X-radiation. The primary function of the silver halide 
grains in indirect radiographic films is to capture 
light and to produce a viewable silver image. Hence 
the silver halide coating coverages of dual-coated 
indirect radiographic films are typically in the range 
from 1.5 to 3.0 g/m2 of silver per side. About the 
same overall silver coverage levels are employed in 
comparable single-sided films (films with silver halide 
emulsion coatings on only one side of the support). To at least partially compensate for the much 
lower X-ray absorption capabilities of silver halide 
emulsions as compared to intensifying screens direct 
radiographic films are coated at much higher silver 
coverages
