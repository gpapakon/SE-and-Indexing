<ABSTRACT>
An optical sensor apparatus capable of accurate measurement
without using a filter circuit, and therefore being further

capable of pulse driving an LED and thus reducing power
consumption, is provided. To achieve such an optical sensor

apparatus, when an optical current sensor 10 is not sensing the
current to be measured, an optical current sensor signal

processing circuit 11 first supplies dc light of a specific
intensity to the optical current sensor 10, and then adjusts the

intensity of the light so that the intensity of light returned
from the optical current sensor 10 to the signal processing

circuit 11 is a specific predetermined value. When the optical
current sensor 10 is sensing the current, the signal processing

circuit 11 electrically processes the optical signal from the
optical current sensor 10 to measure the current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical sensor
apparatus, and relates more specifically to an
intensity-modulated optical sensor apparatus (hereinafter
simply "optical sensor") for measuring such physical quantities
as current and voltage based on intensity modulation of light.
The present invention further relates to a signal processing
circuit used in the aforementioned optical sensor apparatus.An optical sensor can be used for measuring current, voltage,
and other physical properties based on intensity modulation of
light using, for example, the Faraday effect or Pockels effect.
Equipment typical of such optical sensors is taught in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (kokai) S62-150170 (1987-150170).
Such optical sensors are commonly used in the power generating
industry, particularly as current-voltage measurement equipment
and fault detection equipment on power transmission lines,
because of their high withstand voltage and high insulation
properties. Application in general purpose measuring 
instruments has also been considered with the development of high
performance, low cost optical sensors, but this requires the
development of specialized optical sensor signal processing
circuits.FIG. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary optical current
sensor apparatus according to the related art. As shown in FIG.
3, this optical current sensor apparatus comprises an optical
current sensor 30 and an optical current sensor signal processing
circuit (hereinafter referred to as signal processing circuit)
31 connected by means of optical fibers 33 and optical connectors
32. The signal processing circuit 31 comprises an optical-electrical
conversion circuit 311, subtraction circuit 312,
filter 313, LED driver 314, and LED 315.The optical current sensor 30 contains a magneto-optical
crystal (not shown in the figure), detects a change in (the field
strength of) the current to be measured, and intensity modulates
light according to the detection result. The signal processing
circuit 31 supplies a dc light beam to the optical current sensor
30, and calculates a current value based on the modulated optical
signal returned by the optical current sensor 30. It should be
noted that "dc light" as used herein refers to an output light
beam obtained by driving the LED 315 with a dc current.The relationship between the intensity P0 of light
outputted from the signal processing circuit 31 to the optical
current sensor 30, and the intensity P of the optical signal 
returned from the optical current sensor 30 to the
