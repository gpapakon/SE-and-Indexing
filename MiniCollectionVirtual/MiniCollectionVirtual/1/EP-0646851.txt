still camera, for example, includes a color separator (CSA) for 

separating the optical image of a subject from a lens (TL) into a 
plurality of different color images, an optical shutter (PS

the subject to the color separator (CSA), a photoconductive layer (PCL) 
for converting the different color images into respective 

electric charge images, and an information recording medium (R1)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color imaging 
system for use as an electronic still camera, for example. Heretofore, the optical images of subjects are 
recorded using optical photographic cameras or combinations 
of television cameras and video tape recorders. It has also 
been customary to record audio information as well as image 
information on various recording mediums such such cinematographic 
films, magnetic video tapes, or the like. Optical images recorded on photographic films with 
silver-salt light-sensitive photographic emulsions are of 
relatively high resolution, but can be reproduced only after 
being processed by the complex development process. Imaging 
devices such as television camera tubes produce video signals 
representative of optical images, and such produced 
video signals are typically recorded on magnetic video tapes 
by video tape recorders. While the recorded video images 
can quickly be reproduced, the reproduced video images are 
relatively low in resolution because the electron beams used 
in the television camera tubes are of limited diameter. 
Since the capacitance of the target in the camera tubes  
 
increases with the surface area of the target, the image 
resolution cannot be increased even if the target surface 
area is increased. Video signals indicative of moving 
images, which are produced by the television camera tubes, 
have frequencies ranging from several tens MHz to several 
hundreds MHz. These video signals will be poor in signal-to-noise 
ratio if the resolution is increased. Therefore, 
the television camera tubes cannot produce video signals of 
desired high quality and high resolution. Solid-state imaging 
devices for use in television cameras are also subject 
to limitations since it is difficult to two-dimensional 
solid-state sensors with as many pixels as required to 
achieve desired levels of image quality and resolution. 
Video tape recorders available on the market are not yet 
advanced enough to record and reproduce video signals in a 
wide frequency range for desired image quality and 
resolution. There has recently been proposed an imaging system 
for recording images as highly fine electric charge images 
to make it possible to reproduce them with high quality and 
resolution. It has also been proposed to record electric 
charge images as representing video information such as 
still images and also electric charge images as representing 
audio information. Such proposed imaging systems are disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Applications
