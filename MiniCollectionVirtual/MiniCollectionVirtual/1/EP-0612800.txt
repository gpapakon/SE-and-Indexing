<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to propylene polymer 
compositions having excellent properties of being coated (i.e., 
having excellent coating adhesion), and more 
particularly to propylene polymer compositions which have 
high adhesion to coatings such as 
melamine resin coatings and urethane resin coatings even if 
the compositions are not subjected to any surface treatment 
with, for example, a primer or a solvent. Propylene polymers have been widely prepared on an 
industrial scale because they have excellent 
properties such as mechanical properties, heat resistance, 
solvent resistance, oil resistance and chemical resistance. 
Propylene polymers having such properties are widely 
used as materials for industrial parts, e.g. automotive 
parts and electrical apparatus parts, and daily 
necessities. The propylene polymers are chemically inert 
and safe because they have no polar groups in 
their molecules. However, because they have no polar 
groups, they have poor adhesion to other 
resins. Therefore, for coating a molded product formed 
from the propylene polymer with, for example, a urethane  
 
resin coating, it is necessary to perform a treatment 
to improve the affinity of the surface of the product for the 
resin coating, such as an electrical treatment (e.g., corona 
discharge), mechanical surface-roughening treatment, flame 
treatment, oxygen treatment or ozone treatment. Prior to 
practicing these surface treatments, the surface of the molded product 
is generally cleaned, 
with a solvent such as an alcohol or aromatic 
hydrocarbon or with the 
vapors of a solvent such as trichloroethylene, 
perchloroethylene, pentachloroethylene or toluene. An apparatus is necessary to conduct the above-mentioned surface 
treatments, but this is economically disadvantageous. 
In addition 
these treatments require a long period of time. Other 
than the method of the pretreatment of the molded product, 
also utilized is a method of coating the molded product 
with a primer which is able to adhere to propylene polymers 
and then applying a coating such as a urethane resin 
coating to the surface of the primer layer. In this 
method, however, two steps comprising the primer coating 
(undercoating) and the topcoating (final coating) are 
necessary, and hence this method also needs a long period 
of time for the coating. Further, 
formation of the two-layer structure 
consisting of the primer layer and the topcoating layer on 
the molded product increases costs.
