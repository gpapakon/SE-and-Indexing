<ABSTRACT>
In an autonomously responsive laminate formed by sealing an isotropic aqueous solution, in which the 
polysaccharide derivative dissolved in water aggregates due to a temperature rise to cause the cloudy scattering thereof 

to occur, in a cell at least part of which is transparent and through which this aqueous solution can be seen directly, 
the isotropic aqueous solution consists of a solution obtained by dissolved 100 parts by weight of polysaccharide 

derivative of weight average molecular weight of about 10,000-200,000 in about 110-2,000 parts by weight of a water 
medium composed of water the quantity of which corresponds to about 25-450 parts by weight with respect to 100 

parts by weight of the polysaccharide derivative and amphipathic substance. This laminate can be manufactured by 
sealing an isotropic aqueous solution in a cell which is transparent at at least a part thereof, and which permits the 

aqueous solution to be seen directly therethrough, and it can be used advantageously as a window.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated body, its
production and its use, which under the action of heat
resulting from absorption of light becomes cloudy and
restricts or blocks the transmission of light. The present invention
can be realized e.g. in buildings or automobiles
having windows in which only the surface that is directly
irradiated with light selectively blocks light. In
addition, it can also be used in partitions or doors
equipped with electronic curtains by combining it
with a heating element.In recent years, light regulating glass that
reversibly controls the transmission of light by physicochemical means using
compound glass incorporating functional materials has been
proposed as an alternative to mechanical methods. Examples
of such glass include liquid crystal, electrochromic, fine
particle polarized orientation, photochromic and
thermochromic types. In addition, heat absorbing glass and
heat reflecting glass have come to be used in
windows to prevent the entry of solar energy into living
space. However, although heat absorbing glass and heat
reflecting glass certainly prevent the entry of solar
energy into living space, this glass leaves residual
coloring and surface glare, thus having the disadvantage of
losing the inherent advantages of glass in terms of being
colorless and transparent. Moreover, in terms of energy
conservation as well, control of visible light, which has
roughly half of the energy of sunlight, is inadequate.
Furthermore, as is described in detail in the research
report of the 1991 Survey of Countermeasures of the New
Glass Industry of the New Glass Forum (Measures for 
Preventing Global warming), the use of light regulating
glass is related to energy conservation policies, and there
are strong expectations with respect to its future
development.The inventors of the present invention therefore
focused their attention on solar energy irradiated onto
windows. A comfortable living space could be obtained if
window glass would cause a reversible change between
transparency and opacity by automatically responding to the
presence or absence of this energy. This self-responding
quality is extremely appealing not only in terms of the
characteristic of blocking out light from only the
irradiated surface and its effect on energy conservation,
but also with respect to installation, maintenance and
upkeep costs. Although photochromic and thermochromic
types could also be selected from this viewpoint, in
contrast to the mechanism of action of photochromic types
being
