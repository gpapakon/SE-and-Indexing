<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (1) and method for making absorbent 
products (17) in which a first material (10), such as absorbent fluff 

formed from wood pulp, is introduced into a vacuum forming 
chamber (12). A portion of the fluff is deposited into the 

cavity of a mold (19) transported through the forming chamber (12) by 
a forming wheel (7) so as to form a layer of pure fluff within 

the bottom of the mold cavity (20). A second material (11), such as 
superabsorbent particles or heat stabilized fibers, is 

introduced into the forming chamber (12) so that streams of the 
first (10) and second (11) materials collide within a mixing zone (24). 

As the mold (19) continues its travel through the forming 
chamber (12), a mixture of first (10) and second (11) materials from the 

mixing zone (24) is deposited within the mold cavity (20), thereby 
filling it. The portion of the mixture that extends above 

the surface of the mold (19) is scraped off by a scarfing brush (13,14) 
that directs the mixture back into the mixing zone (24), thereby 

creating turbulence that ensures thorough mixing of the two 
materials. The result is an absorbent product having a 

first layer formed by pure first material (10) and a second 
layer formed by a mixture of the first (10) and second (11) 

materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The current invention is directed to an apparatus
for making absorbent products, such as sanitary
napkins and the like, containing a first material dispersed
throughout at least a portion of a second material. More
specifically, the current invention is directed to the
manufacture of an absorbent product having two zones -- one
containing pure fluff and the other containing a fluff
dispersed particulate, such as superabsorbent particles. European patent application 0 313 800 discloses
features contained in the preamble of claim 1 and is related
to a hygienic article made of cellulose as a disposable article
and a method for making it. Articles of this kind, like
diapers, comprise a superabsorbent body to which superabsorbent
substances have been added. This document is based on the
object to provide an optimal dispersion of the absorbent
components of the diaper corresponding substantially to the
profile of disperse of the fluid within the diaper and having
an optimal fluid receiving capacity. In addition to an economic
use of the superabsorbent substances it is intended to
locate most of the absorbent substances in that area of the
diaper which receives most of the fluid. An apparatus for
manufacturing these diapers has a shroud as a guidance for a
first airstream. At the end of this shroud there is mounted a
drivable screen drum being partially enclosed by the shroud.
The circumferential edge portion projects from both of its
side faces. The drum is provided with molds which are separated
by webs and receives mixed substances supplied by the first
and second airstream. The second airstream is vertically
directed into the first airstream carrying the superabsobent
substances. The mixed airstreams are drawn by a vacuum source
through the circumference of the drum so that the mixture of
substances carried therewith are backheld at the periphery of
the drum.US-A-4 674 966 discloses an apparatus for forming
fibrous pads in the shape in which they will be used, without
the need for later cutting and, if desired, with varied thickness
over its surface and by the use of an apparatus which
vacuum-forms fibrous pads by use of interchangeable inserts
having a screen, supported by a foraminous floor which moves
along with the screen to minimize wear to the screen. This 
known apparatus comprises a hammermill to defiberize web of
compressed fibrous material so that the fibers entrained in an
airstream caused by a vacuum source can be drawn down onto
depressions on the upper surfaces of said inserts having the
shape

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (1) for making absorbent products
(17) containing first and second layers (28, 29) in which the

first layer (28) contains pure first material (10) and the second
layer (29) contains a mixture of the first (10) and a second

(11) material, said apparatus comprising:

a vacuum forming unit (4) including a vacuum forming
chamber (12) and a forming wheel (7) within a

housing (18);
the vacuum forming chamber housing (18) having an
inlet (38) being connected to a source of the first

material (10) to be directed into the vacuum forming
chamber (12);
the vacuum forming chamber (12) also having an inlet
(39) being connected to a source (8) of the second

material (11) to be interspersed into the first
material (10) within a mixing zone (24) of said

vacuum forming chamber (12);
the forming wheel (7) being mounted for positively
driven rotation within the housing (18) of the

vacuum forming chamber (12) and placing the vacuum

forming chamber (12) in flow communication with a
duct (6) through which air can be drawn by a vacuum

source (5);
a number of molds (19) being arranged circumferentially
around the periphery of the forming wheel (7);
each of the molds (19) having a cavity (20) that has
the shape of the absorbent product; and
a screen (37) being disposed in the bottom of the
mold cavity (20) being connected to said vacuum

source (5), if said mold (19) enters the vacuum
forming chamber (12);
