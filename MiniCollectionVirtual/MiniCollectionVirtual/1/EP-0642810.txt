<ABSTRACT>
Organic feedstocks (1) containing thermally 
unstable compounds and a halogen component are treated by 

catalytic hydrogenation (2) in admixture with a gaseous 
recycle stream (7) containing hydrogen and a hydrogen 

halide compound and, optionally, a recycle stream (14) 
containing unreacted halogenated organic compounds. The 

resulting effluent (3) is condensed (4) and separated (6) 
to produce said recycle stream (7) and a stream (8) 

containing hydrogenated carbonaceous compounds. An 
anhydrous hydrogen halide product (10) can be recovered. 

The stream (8) can be separated (9,12) to provide a product 
stream (13) containing hydrogenated hydrocarbonaceous 

compounds and the optional recycle stream (14) containing 
unreacted halogenated compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention pertains 
is the conversion of an organic feedstock which contains 
thermally unstable compounds and a halogen component to 
produce hydrocarbonaceous compounds having a reduced 
concentration of halogen moieties. There has always been a demand for the conversion 
or disposal of waste or by-product streams which originate 
in the petroleum, chemical and petrochemical industries. 
More particularly, these by-products originate from the 
chlorination of olefins in the production of epichlorohydrin, 
propylene oxide and vinyl chloride monomers, for 
example. It is common in such streams for the predominant 
species to be halogenated alkanes, but, in addition, in 
some cases, there are present more highly reactive species 
such as olefins and other thermally unstable compounds that 
can often polymerize or decompose during processing thereby 
leading to the plugging of the reactor and its associated 
piping. This polymerization or decomposition process is 
the primary mechanism leading to the formation of 
carbonaceous deposits and the resulting deactivation of the 
conversion catalyst. Previous techniques utilized to 
dispose of waste streams containing halogen components, 
olefins and other heteroatomic compounds have frequently 
become environmentally unpopular or illegal and, in 
general, have always been expensive. With the increased 
environmental emphasis for the treatment and recycle of 
chlorinated organic compounds, there is an increased need 
for the conversion of these products when they become 
unwanted. Therefore, those skilled in the art have sought 
to find feasible techniques to convert such feedstocks to 
provide hydrocarbonaceous product streams having a reduced  
 
concentration of halogen which may be safely and usefully 
employed or recycled. Previous techniques which have been 
employed include incineration and dumping which, in 
addition to potential pollution considerations, fail to 
recover valuable hydrocarbonaceous materials and the 
resulting halogen compounds. The present invention provides a process for 
hydrotreating an organic feedstock containing thermally 
unstable compounds and a halogen component by means of 
contacting the organic feedstock and a gaseous recycle 
stream containing hydrogen and a hydrogen halide compound 
with a hydrogenation catalyst in a hydrogenation reaction 
zone to produce a hydrogenated hydrocarbonaceous stream 
having a reduced concentration of halogen and a halide 
compound stream. The resultant effluent
