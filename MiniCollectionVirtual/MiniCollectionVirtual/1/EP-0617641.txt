<ABSTRACT>
A nozzle assembly (10) for a trigger sprayer having a cap (58) rotatable relative to a housing (12) to establish the spray character of the fluid discharged and a slot (86) and cam follower (88) connection between the trigger sprayer housing (12) and the cap (58) with the cam (86) shaped to impart an "off" condition, a gradually increasing spray condition, a combination spray and stream condition of gradually reversed relative influence, and a stream only condition. The different flow conditions are established by the interrelationship between a spinner head section (24) and the cap (58) that is rotatable along a path controlled by the cam (86) and cam follower (88).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a nozzle assembly for a
trigger sprayer and more particularly to a nozzle assembly
that incorporates a cam and cam follower for controlling
the relative positions of a cap and a housing to
selectively establish the flow condition of fluid discharged
from the trigger sprayer.A typical trigger sprayer has a housing incorporating
a fluid chamber. A manually actuable trigger
pumps fluid from a fluid source to the fluid chamber. A
spinner at the outlet end of the fluid chamber has a
swirl chamber that can impart a spray condition to fluid
being discharged from the housing chamber. A cap is
threaded onto the housing and the rotational position of
the cap changes the flow condition of fluid from a spray
condition to a stream condition. This is caused by the
threaded connection of the cap to the housing in a typical
helical threading configuration. In one threaded
position of the cap, a spray condition is achieved with
the fluid being discharged through an outlet orifice in 
the cap. As the cap is threaded relative to the housing,
a stream character is introduced and with further threading
of the cap, the influence of the stream condition
increases while the influence of the spray character
decreases. Still further threading of the cap achieves a
stream only condition.These threaded cap arrangements do not provide
selective control that enables adjustment of the spray
characteristic of the discharged fluid without influence
from a stream characteristic and separately do not impart
a gradually increasing stream condition with a corresponding
gradually decreasing spray condition to be followed
by a stream only condition that is maintained over a
finite span of rotation of the cap.Some efforts have been made to incorporate a cam
and cam follower in a trigger sprayer. Malone U.S.
Patent No. 3,650,473,
which represents the prior art as referred to in the preamble of
claim 1,
and Micheloff U.S. Patent No.
4,234,128 represent examples of these efforts. In the
Malone patent, only two spray conditions are established
by the position of the cap relative to the spray body.
These two conditions are a spray condition and a stream
condition. In order to establish an "off" condition, it
is necessary to operate a separate hinged cover. Also,
in the Malone device, there are no variations of the
spray condition without immediate influence from the
stream condition.In the Micheloff patent, the trigger sprayer works
differently from the manner of the present invention.

<CLAIMS>
A nozzle assembly (10) for use in combination with a
spray dispenser used for dispensing a liquid substance

from a container in a selectively variable fluid discharge
pattern and flow rate in response to actuation of the

dispenser, the nozzle assembly (10) comprising:

a fluid spinner (22) having a swirl chamber (46) formed
therein for imparting a spin to fluid being dispensed from

the dispenser;
a cap (58) mounted adjacent the fluid spinner (22), the
cap (58) being rotatable relative to the spinner (22)

between first, second and third positions, the cap (58)
being configured to move axially away from the swirl

chamber (46) as the cap (58) is rotated between the second
and third positions to vary the fluid discharge pattern

from a spray to a stream, the cap (58) having an end wall
(70) with a nozzle orifice (72) therein through which

liquid is dispensed;
a housing (13) containing the spinner (22), one of the cap
(58) and the housing (13) having a cam (86) formed therein

and the other of the cap (58) and the housing (13) having
a cam follower (88) configured to engage the cam (86) and

force the cap (58) to move axially away from the spinner
(22) as the cap (58) is rotated between the second and

third positions; characterised in that
a passage is defined by the fluid spinner (22) and cap
(58), the passage being configured to open and close in

response to rotation of the cap (58) between the second
and first positions, respectively, to vary the flow

condition between an on condition and an off condition.
The nozzle assembly (10) of claim 1, wherein the cam
(86) is a slot formed in the housing (13). 
The nozzle assembly (10) of claim 1, wherein the cam
(86) is comprised of an arcuate section (90) connected to

a spiral section (92), the cam follower (88) traversing
the arcuate section (90) as the cap (58) is rotated

between the first and second position, the follower
traversing the spiral section (92) as the cap (58) is

rotated between the second and third position.
The nozzle assembly (10) of claim 3, wherein the cap
(58) is rotatable relative to the spinner (22) between the

to remain at a substantially constant distance from the

spinner (22) as the cap (58) is rotated between the third
and fourth positions to assure that the discharge pattern

rotated between the third and fourth positions, and

the cam (86) is comprised of a second arcuate section (94)
