<ABSTRACT>
A variable cooling time is imposed on ions in a quadrupole ion 
trap prior to excitation through border effect operation. Continuous 

variation of the cooling time brings about continuous variation of the 
selected ion internal energy when subjected to the boundary effect 

such that the boundary effect competes more favorably with ion loss 
in the trap, and fragmentation reaction channels having successively 

greater energies of activation can be accessed preferentially.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of quadrupole ion traps
and mass spectroscopy, and in particular relates to operation of
quadrupole ion traps using border effect excitation.Tandem mass spectroscopy is commonly practiced in a
quadrupole ion trap by the simple expedient of maintaining a residual
partial pressure of a buffer gas in the trap. Some selected ion species
(the parent ion) is selectively stored in the trap. The translational
kinetic energy of the parent ion is increased and collisions with the
buffer gas result with some probability, in the dissociation of the
parent ion into various energetically allowed decay channels. A finger
print of the parent ion is then evident in the mass spectral distribution
of the products of the dissociation.In the prior art, it is known to increase the translational kinetic
energy of stored ions by a resonant process wherein a supplemental
AC field is imposed axially on the trap to transfer energy to the stored
ions. Also a DC pulse of sufficient amplitude can cause stored ions to
collide with the inner surface of the trap. The collision products are
then available for further manipulation. This is described by Cooks et
al, J. American Society for Mass Spectroscopy, V. 2, P. 487 (1992). It
is known that certain operating conditions of the trap which approach
a condition of instability will result in a large non-resonant energy
transfer to the trapped ions. This "border effect" has been recognized
and described by Paradisi et al, Organic Mass Spectrometry, v.27, PP.
251-254 (1992). The Paradisi et al article discloses a sequence in a
quadrupole ion trap with an ionization phase followed by a
separation phase. A storage time then follows prior to an
acquisition phase. The present work makes use of the border effect with the
additional recognition that through a period of selected duration prior
to border effect operation, particular collisional dissociation channels
may be emphasized or de-emphasized in accord with the length of the
pre-border effect excitation interval which is referenced hereafter as
the "cooling time".Operation of a quadrupole ion trap to confine ions within the
trap volume is a well known phenomenon. Associated with the
quadrupole ion trap is a stability diagram (see Fig. 2) representative
of a class of solutions of the equations of motion associated with the
trap geometry. The theory, operation and prior art for quadrupole ion
traps are reviewed in the work Quadrupole Storage Mass
Spectrometry by March and Hughes, Wiley Interscience

<CLAIMS>
A method of selectively fragmenting parent ions by
collisional dissociation in a quadruple ion trap (12-33),

comprising:

(a) introducing a buffer gas to said quadruple ion
trap (12-33),
(b) admitting sample gas for analysis to said
quadruple ion trap (12-33),
(c) ionizing (42) said sample gas,
(d) isolating (44, 46) parent ions by applying at
least an RF field of amplitude V and a DC potential U to

said quadruple ion trap (12-33) so as to trap parent ions
of selected mass-to-charge ratio in a selected stable

operational mode (A-E) of said quadruple ion trap (12-33),
(e) allowing (48,F) said potential U to dwell for a
selectably variable cooling time interval, during which

transfer of energy from said parent ions to said buffer
gas occurs, and
(f) adjusting (49) either said amplitude V or said
potential U to assume values such that said stable mode

of operation is caused to closely approach a condition of
instability so that energy from said RF field is non-resonantly

transferred to said parent ions and from said
parent ions to said buffer gas such that said parent ions

fragment.
The method of claim 1 wherein step (e) further
comprises the step of eliminating ions of mass-to-charge

ratio outside a selected range during said selectively
variable time interval. 
The method of claim 1 wherein step (c) further
includes the step of eliminating ions of mass-to-charge

ratio outside a selected range.
The method of claim 1 wherein said step (c) includes
introducing said sample gas to the quadrupole ion trap

after ionizing said gas.
The method of claim 1 wherein step (d) further
includes isolating a selected parent ion in said trap by

ejecting selected ions from said trap.
