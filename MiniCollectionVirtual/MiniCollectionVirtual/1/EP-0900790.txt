<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel triazine thiol derivative
having a perfluoro group, a method for producing the triazine thiol derivative,
and a film for metal surface which is obtained by subjecting a metal to a
surface treatment with use of the triazine thiol derivative.Triazine thiol derivatives have already been industrially
manufactured (by some manufacturers such as Sankyo Kasei Co. Ltd.) and
used as crosslinking agents, adhesion accelerating agents, surface treatments,
heavy metal treatments, anti-corrosive agents and the like. Among them,
those triazine thiol derivatives whose substituent in 6 place is selected from
the group consisting of -SH, -N(C4H9)2, -NHC6H5 and metal salts thereof have
been especially used as surface treatments for metals and partly put to practical
use (for example, "Practical Surface Treatment Techniques" by Mr. Ikuo Mori,
35, 595 (1988), "Chemical Industry" 42, 1005 (1991)). Although films of
conventional triazine thiol derivatives provided on a surface of solid material
such as a metal had large surface free energy, thereby attaining improved
adhesion property, such conventional films were poor in anti-staining property,
non-tackiness, anti-fogging property, lubricity and anti-icing performance.To solve the above-mentioned problems, Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 6-322595 discloses a method of manufacturing a
metal material in which triazine thiol compounds having perfluoro octyl
anilino group are electrodeposited on a solid material such as a metal by
means of electrolytic polymerizing treatment, so that water repellency is
imparted to the metal. However, the triazine rings of the above-mentioned compounds are
coupled by aromatic anilino group and thus, it has large cohesive force while
being an electron attractive group. Accordingly, the compounds are poor in
solubility, low in reactivity of thiol group and further, critical micelle
concentration (surface activity) of the compounds is high. As a result, the
above-mentioned compounds cannot perform the functions as a surface
treatment agent for metals sufficiently, thereby greatly narrowing the range
of its practical use in industrial fields.Under the circumstances stated above, the inventor has made
various studies in order to solve the above problems and to attain a compound
having a novel molecular structure. As a result thereof, the present
invention has been accomplished.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a
triazine thiol derivative having a perfluoro group, which
