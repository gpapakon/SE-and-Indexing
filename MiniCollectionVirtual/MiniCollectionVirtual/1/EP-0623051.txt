<ABSTRACT>
Disintegrated material is supplied by means of a reciprocating scew piston (2) into a pressure chamber. By rotation said piston in a first axial position is transporting and compacting the material in a receiving chamber (5) against an output valve (4) in front of the piston. The output valve is opened and said compacted material is moved into the pressure chamber by axial non rotative motion of the piston. The output valve then is closed and the piston is axially returned to its first axial position while rotating in the same direction as before. The operation cycle is repeated as above. An apparatus for carrying out said process comprises an axially movable guide piston (7) rotationally carrying and guiding the screw piston (2) for rotation and axial movement by action of a hydraulic cylinder (11) and a mechanism (12) for rotationally positioning the screw piston.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for feeding disintegrated material such as wood chips and the like 
into a collecting container under pressure, the material being 
transported in a pulsing flow from a charging bin through an input 
valve to a cylindrical input chamber, the material being discharged 
axially from this chamber to the collecting container through 
an output valve by means of a feeding piston. Various feeding devices for grainy or fragmented material 
are known, the material being fed in for further treatment without 
any great increase of pressure, or for further treatment under 
an essentially increased pressure. An example of the first mentioned 
treatment is feeding fuel into a fludized bed as described 
in the publication EP-A1- o219686. In this case the fuel is fed in 
from a charging bin by means of a first plane slide which moves 
the fuel from the charge bin laterally to a position in front of 
a cylindrical input slide. Finally, said last mentioned slide 
feeds the fuel through an opened side gate into the fuel chamber. 
The fuel is fed into the fuel chamber without any actual overpressure. In order to feed disintegrated material against a comparatively 
high pressure for further treatment of the material, as 
for example gasifying, some form of lock-passing or sluicing is 
exercised when feeding in. The publication SE-B-456 645 examplifies 
such an apparatus. In this case the material is supplied for 
treatment from a charging bin to a first receiving chamber and is 
removed therefrom, by means of a feed piston or a feed screw, and 
introduced into the input chamber proper through a valve device. 
By means of a feeder piston in the input chamber the material is 
introduced into a following high pressure chamber through a further 
valve. The two valves cooperate in order to bring about 
sluicing of the material into the high pressure side. The final 
feeding into the high pressure chamber takes place by means of 
said piston. The device is especially directed towards input 
sluicing of wet bio mass, such as e.g. damp peat having up to 20 % 
dry substance, into a high pressure reactor operating at a pressure  
 
of up to 150 bar and a temperature of 350o C. In order to ensure 
complete discharge of the peat from the actual input chamber 
(sluice chamber) into the reactor on the high pressure side the 
feed piston is moved past the closing member of the output valve. 
This known device operates by in-feed in two steps, namely, a 
first feeding in from the

A process for feeding disintegrated material such as wood 
chips and the like in one single feeding direction into a 

collecting container under pressure, the material being 
transported in a pulsing flow from a charging bin through an 

input valve to a cylindrical input chamber and discharged 
axially therefrom through an output valve to the collecting 

container by means of a screw shaped feeding piston positioned 
in an axially retracted receiving position in the input chamber 

opposite to the input valve,
characterized
 in that 

a)
 the material is received between the threads of the screw 
shaped feeding piston and transported in essentially 

translatory motion by rotation of said piston in axially 
stationary piston position through the chamber towards the 

output valve then closed, rotation of material about the piston 
axis being prevented by axial grooves on input chamber walls 

under axial transport of material sliding against the rotating 
screw piston,

the chamber in front of the output valve, 
c)

release, 
e)

pushed, by the screw piston being moved axially, into the  

 
collecting container through a slightly expanding pressure tube

movement of the plug, 
f)

back to its starting position while rotating in the same 

direction as when feeding in material and in correspondence to 
the pitch of the screw piston, and
