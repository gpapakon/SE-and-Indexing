<ABSTRACT>
In a hose-cutting device (1) with a rotor (12) which rotates around the hose axis, and upon which is mounted at least a blade-holder (18a, b, c) with blades (4a, b, c) so as to move between a rest and a cutting position in a pressure chamber (11), the pressure chamber (11) is delimited by the housing (14), the rotor (12) and the blade-holder (18a, b, c). Three curved blade-holders (18a, b, c) to each of which is centrally secured a blade may be arranged on the rotor (12). At their first end (27) the blade-holders (18a, b, c) are swivellingly mounted and with their second end (28) they surround the respective first end of the adjacent blade-holder. The blade-holders (18a, b, c) are swivelled inwards by pressurised gas, so that the blades (4a-4c) cut into the hose (2).
