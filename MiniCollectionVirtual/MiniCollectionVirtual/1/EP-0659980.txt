<ABSTRACT>
An improved system for recovering waste heat from 
a combustion turbine in a combined cycle power plant of the 

type that includes at least one combustion turbine (22) and at 
least one steam turbine (16) includes a first heat recovery 

system (60,54,46) for heating condensate in the steam turbine cycle 
with heat from the hot exhaust gases from the combustion-type 

turbine, and a second heat recovery system (74,66) for heating 
the fuel that is used in the combustion turbine with heat 

from the exhaust gases. The second system permits recovery 
of heat energy that is not recovered by the first system, 

thereby improving plant efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to combined cycle
power plants of the type that include at least one combustion-type
turbine and at least one steam-type turbine.
More specifically, this invention relates to an improved
system for recovering waste heat from a combustion turbine
in such a combined cycle power plant.It is well known in the field of power generation to
provide one or more steam turbines in a plant with one or
more combustion-type turbines and to use the waste heat
contained in the exhaust of the combustion turbines to
generate motive steam for the steam turbines. Plants such
as these are typically referred to as "combined cycle power
plants."In a combined cycle-type power plant, spent motive
steam from the steam-type turbine is condensed into a
liquid condensate in a condenser. The condensate is then
pumped through a deaerator and from the deaerator into one
or more heat exchangers that transfer heat from the exhaust
gases of the combustion-type turbine to the condensate. In
the heat exchangers, the waste heat from the combustion
turbine exhaust is recovered to heat the condensate back
into steam, which is then redirected to the steam-type
turbine. Such a system is disclosed in U.S. Patent
4,961,311 to Pavel et al.Reference is also made to EP-A-0391082 which discloses
a combined cycle power plant wherein the fuel for the
combustion turbine is preheated by excess flow through an
economizer section of a heat recovery steam generator,
thereby extracting additional heat from the heat recovery
system.Unfortunately, some waste heat from the turbine exhaust
remains unrecovered in even the most efficient conventional
combined cycle power plants, and is released to
the environment. It is generally recognized that any 
improvements that permit recovery of some of the presently
unrecoverable waste heat to increase plant efficiency would
be desirable.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to
provide an improved system for recovering waste heat from a
combustion turbine in a combined cycle power plant that has
heretofore been unrecoverable.The invention consists in a combined cycle power plant
having a combustion-type turbine with a fuel inlet and an
outlet for emitting hot gases that are combustion products,
a fuel line communicating with said fuel inlet, a steam
type turbine having a steam inlet and a steam outlet; a
condenser in communication with said steam outlet for
condensing spent steam from said steam type turbine into a
liquid condensate, a deaerator, a pump for supplying
