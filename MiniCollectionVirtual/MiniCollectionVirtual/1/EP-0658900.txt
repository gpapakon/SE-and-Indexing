<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a data storage device secured against unauthorised use by a mechanical lock. The data storage device is connected to a safety lock (12). Means (64; 224, 228; 428, 430) interacting with the safety lock (12) are suitable for permitting or preventing access to the data storage device.

Insertable lock (12) intended to be inserted
into a lock receptacle (50), with a writable and/or

readable data store firmly connected operatively to the
said lock, the insertable lock (12) and the data store

forming a data lock (10, 110, 310), and at least one
enabling device (64; 224, 228; 428, 430), which cooperates

with the insertable lock (12), allowing or
preventing access to the data store.
Data lock according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the data store cannot be released from the

insertable lock (12), without the said data store or
insertable lock (12) being destroyed.
Data lock according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the data store is writable and/or

readable via an electrically isolating coupling device
having one or more transmission channels, different

transmission channels being assigned different storage
regions and/or different access privileges (read-out,

modification of storage content).
Data lock according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the data store and the coupling device are

parts of a transponder (14, 114, 314) known per se and
operating with radio waves as a transmission medium,

each transmission channel being assigned a coupling
coil (16; 116, 116'). 
Data lock according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the coupling coil consists of two antiparallel-connected

windings, and in that at least one
transmission channel can be enabled by the insertion of

the data lock (10) into a lock receptacle (50),
enabling taking place as a result of damping means (64)

which are arranged on the lock receptacle (50) and
which damp one of the windings.
Data lock according to Claim 3 or 4,
characterized in that at least one transmission channel

can be blocked by the insertion of the data lock (10)
into a lock receptacle (50), blocking taking place as a

result of blocking means (64) arranged on the lock
receptacle (50).
Data lock according to one of Claims 3 to 6,
characterized in that at least one transmission channel

is enabled by the insertion of a key (120) into the
keyway of the insertable lock (12) and/or by the

rotation of the key into one of at least two locking
positions or by the withdrawal of the key from the

keyway, enabling taking place as a result of the change
in position of blocking means (228) arranged on the

lock cylinder (122).
Data lock according to Claim 7, characterized
in that predeterminable combinations 
of transmission
channels to be enabled are assigned to different

locking positions.
Data lock according to Claim 7 or 8,
characterized in that predeterminable combinations of

transmission channels to be enabled are assigned to
differently privileged keys.
Data lock according to one of Claims 7 to 9,
characterized in that a pin (224, 424) having a

transport thread (226) is arranged at that end (220) of
the lock cylinder (122) which is remote from the key,

the said pin changing the position of a blocking means
(228) relative to the coupling device (116, 116') when

the key (120) is actuated. 
Data lock according to one of Claims 4 to 10,
characterized in that a reed contact (430) is built

into the transponder (314), the said reed contact being
capable of being actuated by a permanent magnet (428),

the position of which can be changed relative to the
said reed contact, the change in position of the said

permanent magnet being caused by the actuation of the
insertable lock (12).
Data lock according to one of Claims 4 to 11,
the data lock (310) being capable of being inserted

into a lock receptacle (350), characterized in that a
reed contact (432) is built into the transponder (314),

the said reed contact being capable of being actuated
by a permanent magnet (436) connected to the lock

receptacle (350).
Data lock according to one of Claims 1 to 12,
characterized in that it can be inserted into a lock

receptacle (50) without the use of a key, but can be
extracted from the said lock receptacle only by the use

of the associated key (20, 120).
Data lock according to Claim 13, characterized
in that the insertable lock (12) contains a bolt

element (18) which, in its locking position, is loaded
by the force of a spring (34) and which can be brought

into its unlocking position, counter to the spring
force, as a result of the actuation of the key (20,

120).
Arrangement according to Claim 13 or 14,
characterized in that the lock receptacle (50) has a

bolt latch (56), of which the ramp (58) facing the
insertion side for the data lock (10) ascends at a low

inclination and of which the rearward ramp (60) is set
back essentially vertically, and in that the bolt

element (18) engages behind the rearward ramp (60) when
the data lock (10) is pushed into the lock receptacle

(50). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 15,
characterized in that a lock receptacle (50) is mounted

on a transport pallet or a transport container and the
data store contains information on the transported

product and/or its owner, and in that this information
serves for controlling the use or transport of the

pallet or container.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 15,
characterized in that a lock receptacle (50) is mounted

on a valuables container, in particular a money
cassette or a cash-register drawer, and the data store

contains information on the content of the valuables
container and/or the person or persons responsible for

it, and in that this information serves for controlling
an accounting device.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 15,
characterized in that a lock receptacle (50) is mounted

on an electronic appliance, in particular a personal
computer, a workstation or an electronic cash-register,

and the data store contains information which is used
to establish identity and/or authorization.
