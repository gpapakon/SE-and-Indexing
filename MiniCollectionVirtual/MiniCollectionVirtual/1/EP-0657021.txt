<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of improving the 
accuracy of a measuring result obtainable by means of a flow 
meter of the type defining therein a flow passage for a 
medium flow to be measured, which flow meter comprises a 
sensor for sensing a varying condition of the medium flowing 
through the passage, means for generating ultrasonic signals 
and for directing such signals in opposite directions along 
at least part of the flow passage, means for receiving signals 
having passed along said at least part of the flow 
passage, and electronic circuit means for calculating or 
determining a measured flow rate value of the medium based on 
the difference in velocity of transmitting the ultrasonic 
signals in said opposite directions. A flow meter of this type is disclosed for example in German 
patents Nos. 29 24 561, 29 34 031, and 30 39 710. As 
described in these patent specifications, various factors, 
such as varying acoustic loads on the ultrasound generating 
disc of piezoelectrical material at varying temperatures, 
undesired disturbing echoes of ultrasonic signals transmitted 
to a receiving transducer, and varying, uneven conditions of 
the flow into and out from the flow passage may adversely 
influence the accuracy of the measuring results to an unsatisfactory 
degree. SU 792143 discloses a testing device for testing the accuracy 
of flow meters. This known testing device may simulate a flow 
rate, and the flow rate measured by the flow meter being 
tested is compared to the flow rate simulated. This known 
testing device renders it possible to draw graphs showing the 
absolute error of measurements in dependency of the temperature 
and pressure of the medium flow measured. US-A-4164865, which is also referred to in US-A-4372166, 
in col.1-2, discloses a flowmeter operating on the principle 
of transmitting ultrasonic waves in upstream and 
downstream directions and using the difference in the 
velocities in these directions as the basis of the calculation 
of flow rate, and discloses the features of the 
preamble of claim 1. The circuit used employs an amplifier 
156 (see col. 12, lines 35-59) delivering an output 
representative of the sound velocity (dependent of gas 
composition), which varies with temperature and pressure 
(see col. 2, lines 6-11). This output is compared with a 
(stored) value for the calibrating liquid and used to 
modify the flow rate measurement. 
DE-A-3312092 discloses a main ultrasonic meter for the 
travel time measurement of flow rate and a reference
