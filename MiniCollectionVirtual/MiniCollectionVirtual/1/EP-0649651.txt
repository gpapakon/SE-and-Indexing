<ABSTRACT>
Soft gelatin capsules having a capsule shell comprising gelatin, plasticizers and, 
if desired or required, further auxiliary agents, and a capsule filling containing a 

solvent including a migrateable solvent such as 1,2-propyleneglycol as a solvent 
in the capsule filling and in the capsule shell. The manufacture of said capsules 

is improved, if in the process for making the soft gelatin capsules the gelatin 
bands are cooled with a liquid, and preferably with water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soft gelatin capsules having a capsule shell
made of gelatin, plasticizing agents, in particular 1,2-propylene glycol, and
optionally further auxiliary materials, and a capsule filling containing solvent,
wherein 1,2-propyleneglycol is also present,
adjuvants and one or more pharmacologically active substances. The invention
further relates to a process for preparing such soft gelatin capsules.Some pharmacologically active substances may have biopharmaceutical and/or
physicochemical properties which make them difficult to formulate into
commercially acceptable formulations. Such substances may however be
conveniently administered in liquid form, e.g in a complex carrier medium made
up of several components. Solvents such as 1,2-propylene glycol and dimethyl
isosorbide have great potential in such carrier media. The carrier medium may
be designed to form an emulsion in the stomach thereby facilitating absorption of
the pharmacologically active substance. The carrier medium may have to be
accurately prepared and even slight variations in the composition cannot be
tolerated without irreversibly upsetting the system, and destroying its beneficial
properties. Thus the solubilizing properties of the capsule filling may be changed
and the active substance precipitates out. This precipitation process may be
irreversible, and the patient is under-dosed. The emulsifying properties of the
capsule filling may be changed, and, upon administration, an emulsion may not
be formed in the stomach and the pharmacologically active substance is not
correctly or reproducibly absorbed.Encapsulation of such liquid formulations in soft gelatine capsules potentially
offers a very convenient way of administering such pharmacologically active
substances. However the manufacture of commercially acceptable liquid filled
sort gelatine capsules is fraught with difficulties which restricts the availability of
this approach. Thus, during manufacture, the capsule shell is formed from wet 
gelatine bands and the resultant wet capsules are dried. During this stage or
even afterwards, we have found that components in the capsule filling may
migrate into the capsule shell, and vice versa, thereby changing the composition
of the capsule filling at least in the boundary region near the interface of the
capsule filling and the capsule shell, with the result that the beneficial properties
of the capsule filling are lost.In recent years microemulsion pre-concentrates have been developed as carrier
media for active
