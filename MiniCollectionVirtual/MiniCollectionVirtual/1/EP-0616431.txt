<ABSTRACT>
An input buffer for utilization in a programmable 
logic device (PLD). The input buffer includes an 

inverter (200) consisting of a PMOS pull up transistor (202) one 
half the size of a corresponding NMOS pull down 

transistor (204) to enable TTL compatibility. To drive a high 
capacitance load, instead of utilizing further buffering 

which introduces gate delays, a cascode transistor (300) is 
used to control an additional pull up output driver (302) 

connected to the output of the inverter (200). The cascode 
functions to turn on the additional pull up output 

driver (302) to supplement the PMOS pull up transistor (202) during 
a low to high transition of the output. The input 

buffer further includes a switching transistor (500) coupled 
between a V
DD
 power supply and the PMOS pull up 
transistor (202) to cut power to the PMOS pull up transistor (202) 

when the inverter (200) has a low output. With no utilization 
of power during a low output, the input buffer provides 

a zero power TTL input enabling the input buffer to be 
utilized on circuitry in battery powered devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an input 
buffer preferably of the type
 
which provides an interface between a digital integrated 
circuit and circuitry external to the digital integrated 
circuit. Preferably, it 
relates to an input buffer for a programmable array 
logic (PAL) device. Fig. 1 shows a block diagram for the AmPALCE22V10, 
a typical programmable logic device manufactured by 
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. The internal circuitry of 
the AmPALCE22V10 is CMOS logic. To enable the circuitry 
of the AmPALCE22V10 to be compatible with circuitry 
external to the chip, which may be TTL logic, input 
buffers 100(a-1) are utilized. The AmPALCE22V10 further includes output logic 
macrocells 102 connected to provide an output which 
registered or combinatorial. The output from the output 
logic macrocell can be fed back into an input buffer on 
the chip. Fig. 2 shows typical prior art input buffer, such as 
that utilized on the AmPALCE22V10. In Fig. 2, an input 
signal to the input buffer is received by a CMOS 
inverter 200. In order for the input buffer of Fig. 2 
to be TTL compatible, the CMOS inverter 200 should have 
a threshold at around 1.5 volts, assuming a valid TTL 
high level is 2.0 volts. The 1.5 volt threshold is achieved by making the 
PMOS transistor 202 of inverter 100 relatively weak, or  
 
about half the size of the NMOS transistor 204. Note 
that circles on transistors, such as transistor 202, 
indicate a P-type transistor, while no circle on a 
transistor indicates an N-type transistor. With 
transistor 202 being half the size of transistor 204 
inverter 200 has approximately a quarter of the drive 
capability because of the reduced mobility of holes in 
relation to electrons. Note that a TTL high to a standard CMOS input will 
result in the PMOS 202 not turning off completely so 
that the first inverter will draw power. Typically, the 
input would have to be raised to within less than 1.0 
volt of the supply voltage for the input stage to not 
draw power. To avoid TTL high power consumption, extra steps may 
be added to a standard CMOS fabrication process to 
create a PMOS transistor which turns completely off at 
TTL high input levels. Inverters 206 and 208 are added to the output of 
inverter 200 in order to drive a high capacitance node 
connected to the input buffer output. Note, however, 
that each inverter added to the signal path of the input 
buffer has an inherent gate delay so that the decision 
to add buffering in order to achieve the highest 
performance is dependent
