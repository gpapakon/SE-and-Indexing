<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to plasma 
arc torches. More specifically it relates to a method 
for reliably starting a transferred arc plasma torch according to the 
preamble of claim 1 (see US-A-5 036 176). Reliable ignition of a plasma arc torch has 
been a significant problem throughout the development 
of plasma technology for cutting metallic workpieces. 
It is particularly important today where multiple cuts 
are made in unison by multiple torches. All torches 
should start at substantially the same time; and it is 
essential that they all start regardless of the 
precise timing of the start. More generally, 
reliability of starting is increasingly important as 
plasma cutting torches are used in robotic 
applications where human interventions to replace or 
repair a torch that will not start is a serious 
detriment to the reliability and cost effectiveness of 
a large automated operation. One solution has been contact starting, one 
form of which is described in commonly assigned U.S. 
Patent No. 4,791,268. However, the principal starting 
technique in use today uses a high frequency high 
voltage (HFHV) signal coupled to a power line from a 
D.C. power supply to an electrode of the torch. The 
HFHV signal induces a spark discharge in a plasma gas  
 
flowing between the electrode and a nozzle, typically 
in a spiral path. A HFHV generator is usually 
incorporated in a power supply or in a "console" 
located remotely from the torch and connected to the 
torch by a lead set. While a number of HFHV generators are known, 
e.g. capacitive discharge circuits and high voltage 
transformers, the most common type, shown in Fig. 1, 
is a Marconi RF generator. The generator produces, 
for typical plasma arc ignition purposes, a 5 to 10 kV 
impulse that oscillates at 1 to 3 mHz. This signal 
propogates through the lead set to the electrode 
(cathode) and nozzle (anode) where it ionizes the 
plasma gas to produce charge carriers. The ionized 
charge carriers in the plasma gas create a current 
carrying path that can sustain an arc. While this technique seems straightforward in 
practice, it is a difficult and complex problem At 
the time of arc ignition, the location of the arc on 
the electrodes, and its maintenance once it is 
initially struck depend on many factors that vary, and 
some of which may be interdependent. The result is 
that the voltage at which breakdown occurs, and the 
time at which it occurs, are random events. Some of 
the factors include the cathode and anode geometries 
and gap

<CLAIMS>
A method of reliably starting and maintaining an arc in a plasma 
arc torch where a high-frequency, high-voltage (HFHV) signal initiates a 

breakdown in a plasma gas flowing between the electrode (18) and the 
nozzle (22), and where a surge injection circuit (38) includes a surge 

capacitor (C
4
) initially charged to a predetermined value and a DC power 
supply (28) connected across the surge injection circuit (38), said surge 

injection circuit (38) supplying current to maintain the arc as a pilot arc 
(11a) and then a transferred arc (11b), characterised in that:
 
   said HFHV signal applied between the electrode (18) and nozzle 

(22) is pulsed with intervals between pulses having a time period T which 
is at least equal to the time required for the power supply (28) to charge 

the surge injector circuit (38) to a value sufficient to initiate and sustain 
the pilot arc (11a) the value being substantially the same as the 

pre-determined value while the DC power supply (28) ramps up from a 
zero current open circuit output. 
The starting method of Claim 1 wherein said interval T is equal to 
at least three times the time constant of the surge circuit.
