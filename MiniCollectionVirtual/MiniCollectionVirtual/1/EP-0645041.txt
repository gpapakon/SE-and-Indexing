<ABSTRACT>
A music teaching aid (10) which comprises a base member having a surface on which a number of reference rings (13) are positioned so as to have independent rotatable movement on the base member. Depending on the shape of the base member, the reference rings (13) are either substantially coaxial cylindrical sleeves or concentric rings. Each reference ring (13) has an outside surface which is divided into segments each of which displays indicia representing a note of the chromatic scale and which is identifiable by a predetermined colour coding system such that when segments of the reference rings (13) are aligned in accordance with the predetermined colour coding system, corresponding segments of each successive ring will represent the notes of a non-chromatic scale.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a music teaching aid, in particular, a device that can be
used to calculate various forms of musical scales and display them in all keys simultaneously.Sounds recognised as music can be characterized generally in terms of rhythm
and pitch. The pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound wave that is produced by a
musical instrument or human larynx. The difference in pitch between a wave of frequency f
and a wave of frequency 2f is termed an octave and is subdivided into eight "notes" which when
played in succession comprise a scale.An octave, more specifically, consists of 12 half-notes or semitones which when
played successively produce a chromatic scale (ie C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A# and
B). The difference in pitch or interval spanning two semitones is called a tone and the
sequences of tones and semitones characterize a variety of non-chromatic scales such as the
major, harmonic minor and melodic minor scales. The ascending major scale for example is
characterized by the succession of two tones, one semitone, three more tones and one more
semitone (the scale can also be described in terms of two tetrachords of two tones followed by
one semitone, wherein the two tetrachords are separated by a tone). The ascending harmonic
minor scale, however, is characterized by one tone, one semitone, two more tones, one more 
semitone, one and a half tones and a final semitone. Each note of the scale is described by a
letter A through G and sharps (#) and flats (b) are used to describe the semitones that fall
between those letters. For example, the interval between A and B is one tone, the semitone
above A is A# but can alternatively be described as the semitone below B, or Bb.Whether a scale will contain certain sharps or flats depends on what the first,
tonic, or base note of the scale is. For a major scale, if the tonic is C, the scale is said to be
in the "key of C major". In that key there are no sharps or flats. However, if the tonic is C
sharp (ie C# major key) there are seven sharps and if the tonic is C flat (ie Cb major key) there
are seven flats.It can be very difficult for a student, and sometimes a music teacher, to determine
the correct notes of a certain type of scale in a certain key. However, it becomes even more
difficult to rewrite or "transpose" music that has been written in one key into another key. For
example, the ascending C major scale is C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. Transposing it to D major
is not simply a matter of replacing each note with the next

<CLAIMS>
A music teaching aid comprising a plurality of reference
rings (13) each rotatable about a common axis, each ring

having a surface divided into a plurality of segments having
indicia representing a musical note characterised in that each

segment of each ring has indicia representing a note of the
chromatic scale and individually identified by a colour in a

colour coding system such that when the reference rings (13)
are rotated relative to one another to align selected segments

of successive rings (13a-13g) according to the colour coding
system, the indicia of said adjacent aligned segments of each

successive ring represent the notes of a non-chromatic scale.
A music teaching aid according to claim 1 comprising
seven or more said reference rings (13).
A music teaching aid according to claim 1 or 2, wherein
when the reference rings (13) are rotated to align according

to the colour coding the hue of the colour of adjacent aligned
segments differ to indicate the notes are ascending up the

scale.
A music teaching aid according to any one of clains 1 to
3, wherein the colours of adjacent segments of the ring alter

prismatically along the ring.
A music teaching aid according to any one of claims 1 to
4 wherein the surface around each ring (13) is divided into 

twelve similar segments and the indicia around each ring
represent all the notes of the chromatic scale, such that the

rings may be rotated to align according to the colour coding
system whereby the segments of successive rings represent the

notes of a type of scale such as major, enharmonic minor or
melodic minor scales.
A music teaching aid according to any one of claims 1 to
5 wherein both enharmonic equivalents of a musical note having

such enharmonic equivalents are displayed on some segments
(40, 41, 42).
A music teaching aid according to claim 6, wherein the
colour of any segments representing the notes between the

diatonic notes of a scale is an intermediate colour between
the colour of the segments representing the diatonic notes on

each side.
A music teaching aid according to claim 6, wherein
segments comprising indicia representing both enharmonic

equivalents of a musical note are divided into two semi-segments
each containing an indicia representing one of said

enharmonic equivalent notes.
A music teaching aid according to claim 8 wherein each of
said semi-segments is an intermediate colour related to the

colour of the basic note. 
A music teaching aid according to claim 6, wherein the
non-diatonic notes are indicated by brighter or flatter

versions of the colour of the basic diatonic note.
A music teaching aid according to any one of claims 1 to
10 also incorporating an integral metronome to generate an

audibly repetitive beat.
A music teaching aid according to claim 6 wherein
segments (40, 41, 42) comprising indicia representing both

enharmonic equivalents of a musical note are represented in
such a manner as to identify which of the enharmonic

equivalents is correct for the non-chromatic scale represented
by the segments aligned according to the colour coding system.
