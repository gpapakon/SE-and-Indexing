<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an electronic flip-chip device 
(12) encapsulated in an elastomeric silicone rubber 

material (16). Also disclosed is a method of 
encapsulating a flip-chip electronic device (12) 

including placing the flip-chip electronic device (12) 
in a mould (28,30) and injecting a self-hardening 

silicone composition (16) into the mould (28,30) at a 
temperature so that solder bumps (14) of the flip-chip 

device (12) do not collapse and the flip-chip device 
(12) maintains its position above the substrate (10) 

on which it is mounted. The moulding process also 
prevents the solder bumps (14) from flowing and 

short-circuiting the hybrid circuit. The electronic 
device may be held in a position in the mould by 

support pins (22) connected to the periphery of the 
substrate (10) of the device. The support pins (22) 

extend from, and are supported by, a rigid support 
strip (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
electronic devices including encapsulated flip-chip 
electronic devices as specified in the preamble of 
claim 1. Electronic devices have been encapsulated by 
a variety of materials. However, encapsulation of 
electronic devices having flip-chips thereon has been 
particularly problematic. In the manufacture of 
"flip-chip" devices, an integrated circuit is made in 
a silicon chip. Solder bumps are formed on one face 
of the chip at locations on the integrated circuit 
where electrical connection is desired. The chip is 
"flipped" over and mounted by the solder bumps to a 
hybrid circuit so that the integrated circuit side of 
the chip is face down. The use of flip-chips has a 
variety of advantages, one of which is to elevate the 
chip above the surface of the substrate to which it is 
mounted. In the elevated position, the chip operates 
at cooler temperatures due to improved heat 
dissipation. Flip-chips also eliminate potential 
parasitic effects associated with wire bonding to 
other types of chips. Maintaining the integrity of the solder bump 
and the level of the flip-chip above the substrate is 
extremely important. Encapsulation processes which 
involve moulding a material at high temperatures 
around a flip-chip is undesirable. The high 
temperature of such moulding processes causes the 
solder bumps to flow, often resulting in the 
short-circuiting of the hybrid circuit, therefore 
causing the chip to fail, or the flip-chip becoming 
elevated in a lopsided orientation. Thus, it would be desirable to develop an 
encapsulated flip-chip electronic device, and method 
of making the same, which does not cause the solder  
 
bumps to flow, and which maintains the integrity and 
position of the flip-chip on the device. A semi-conductor device according to the 
present invention is characterised by the features 
specified in the preamble of claim 1. Generally, the invention includes an 
electronic flip-chip device encapsulated in silicone 
material. The invention also includes a method of 
encapsulating a flip-chip electronic device which 
includes placing the flip-chip electronic device in a 
mould and injecting a self-hardening silicone 
composition at a temperature that will prevent 
collapse of the solder bumps on the flip-chip and will 
maintain the position of the flip-chip above the 
substrate. The moulding process also prevents the 
solder bumps from flowing and short-circuiting the 
hybrid circuit to which the flip-chip is mounted. The 
substrate
