<CLAIMS>
Spindle for a spinning machine, especially a ring 
spinning machine, with an underwinding region provided 

with profiling, characterized in that the profiling (3) 
consists of recesses (10) which are worked into the 

underwinding region (2) and are closed over their circumference 
and which are separated from one another by banks 

(11) having flat crests (12) lying in an imaginary 
cylindrical surface coaxial relative to the axis of the 

spindle. 
Spindle according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the recesses (10) are of pyramidal design. 
Spindle according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the banks (11) lie in mutually intersecting 

spirals in the imaginary cylindrical surface coaxial 
relative to the axis of the spindle. 
Spindle according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the profiling (3) is reworked by 

lathe-turning or grinding. 
Tool for producing the underwinding region of a 
spindle according to one of the preceding claims, consisting 

of a rolling cylinder having pyramidal tips which 
are separated from one another by pits with flat pit 

bottoms.
