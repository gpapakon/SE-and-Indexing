<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with amidrazones, pesticidal (e.g.
insecticidal) amidrazone compositions, and methods of using such compositions.The search for compounds which have a combination of excellent insecticidal
activity and low undesirable toxicity is a continuing one because of factors such as
the desire for compounds exhibiting greater activity, better selectivity, low
undesirable environmental impact, low production cost, and effectiveness against
insects resistant to many known insecticides.EP-A-0 261 755 and EP-A-0 347 216 disclose insecticidal N'-substituted-N,N'-diacylhydrazines.
However, neither of these documents disclose or suggest the
specific amidrazones to which the present invention is directed. In particular,
neither EP-A-0 261 755 nor EP-A-0 347 216 discloses or suggests compounds
diacylkydrazine compounds wherein the nitrogen atom of one of the hydrazine
groups bears a =O group and the nitrogen of the other hydrazine group bears a
-NR1,R2 group wherein R1 and R2 are alkyl.Compounds of the present invention have utility for controlling plant-destructive
pests (e.g. insects) in crops of cultivated plants, ornamentals, and
forestry.According to the present invention, there is provided a compound having the
formula

wherein 
A and B are each independently aryl or aromatic heterocyclyl, optionally
substituted with one or two substituents selected from (C1-C6)alkyl, (C1-C6)alkoxy,
halo, halo(C1-C6)alkyl and nitro;U is oxygen;Y is NR1R2,
   wherein:
(a) R1 and R2 are alkyl; or(b) R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached
form a 5- or 6- membered ring; and(c) Z is a straight or branched (C3-C9)alkyl;
   or an agronomically acceptable salt of such compound.Further, in accordance with the present invention, there are provided
compositions containing compounds of the present invention, and methods of using
such compounds and compositions.In the following definitions, unless stated otherwise, the alkyl and alkoxy,
groups may, optionally, be substituted with one or more substituent selected from
halo such as fluoro, chloro or bromo, cyano, nitro, alkyl such as methyl, and
mixtures thereof.Preferably, "(C1-C6)alkoxy" is methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy,
n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, isobutoxy or t-butoxy.
"(C1-C6)alkyl" means straight and branched (C1-C6)alkyl groups, preferably
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, s-butyl, t-butyl or n-pentyl."Aromatic Heterocyclyl" is a fully unsaturated five or six membered
heterocyclic ring containing one,
