An iontophoretic delivery device (10) is provided. Device (10) has an electronic circuit (32) having electronic components such as batteries (30) mounted thereon. Device (10) also includes a pair of electrode assemblies (18, 19). The electronic circuit (32) is electrically connected to the electrode assemblies (18, 19) using an electrically conductive adhesive (34). The adhesive can also be used to electrically connect two or more electronic components within circuit (32) or to connect an electronic component to the electronic circuit (32). In one practice of the invention, the electrically conductive adhesive (44) functions as an electrode and electrically connects the circuit (32) to an agent-containing reservoir (24, 25). In a further practice of the invention, the electrically conductive adhesive (93) functions as an agent reservoir and contains the agent to be iontophoretically delivered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally concerns an apparatus for the 
electrically assisted delivery of a therapeutic agent. More specifically, this invention concerns a flexible apparatus 
for iontophoretic drug delivery having at least two components which 
are electrically connected in a novel, inexpensive, yet reliable 
manner. Preferably, the apparatus has an electronic circuit which is 
electrically connected to another component or sub-assembly of the 
apparatus in this same novel, inexpensive, yet reliable manner. The present invention concerns apparatuses for transdermal 
delivery or transport of therapeutic agents, typically through 
iontophoresis. Herein the terms "iontophoresis" and "iontophoretic" 
are used to refer to methods and apparatus for transdermal delivery 
of therapeutic agents, whether charged or uncharged, by means of an 
applied electromotive force to an agent-containing reservoir. The 
particular therapeutic agent to be delivered may be completely 
charged (i.e., 100% ionized), completely uncharged, or partly charged 
and partly uncharged. The therapeutic agent or species may be 
delivered by electromigration, electroosmosis or a combination of the 
two. Electroosmosis has also been referred to as 
electrohydrokinesis, electro-convection, and electrically-induced 
osmosis. In general, electroosmosis of a therapeutic species into a 
tissue results from the migration of solvent, in which the species is 
contained, as a result of the application of electromotive force to 
the therapeutic species reservoir. As used herein, the terms "iontophoresis" and "iontophoretic" 
refer to (1) the delivery of charged drugs or agents by 
electromigration, (2) the delivery of uncharged drugs or agents by 
the process of electroosmosis, (3) the delivery of charged drugs or  
 
agents by the combined processes of electromigration and 
electroosmosis, and/or (4) the delivery of a mixture of charged and 
uncharged drugs or agents by the combined processes of 
electromigration and electroosmosis. Iontophoretic devices for delivering ionized drugs through the 
skin have been known since the early 1900's. Deutsch UK Patent No. 
410,009 (1934) describes an iontophoretic device which overcame one 
of the disadvantages of such early devices, namely that the patient 
needed to be immobilized near a source of electric current. The 
Deutsch device was powered by a galvanic cell formed from the 
electrodes and the material containing the drug to be transdermally 
delivered. The galvanic cell produced the current
