<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sample treatment composition for lipoprotein-containing samples and for immunochemical determination of an antigen, where the composition contains a diluting buffer with a content of an amino acid, where appropriate with a content of a reaction accelerator, and antibodies against the antigen to be determined.

Sample treatment means for lipoprotein-containing
samples and for the immunochemical determination of an

antigen, characterised in that the means contain a
dilution buffer with a content of an amino acid,

optionally with a content of a reaction accelerator, and
antibodies against the antigens to be determined.
Sample treatment means for lipoprotein-containing
samples and for immunochemical determination of a

lipoprotein, characterised in that the means contain a
dilution buffer with a content of an amino acid,

optionally with a content of a reaction accelerator, and
antibodies against the lipoprotein to be detected.
Sample treatment means for Lp(a)-containing samples
and for immunochemical determination of Lp(a),

characterised in that the means contain a dilution buffer
with a content of an amino acid, optionally with a

content of reaction accelerator, and antibodies against
Lp(a).
Sample treatment means according to one of Claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the amino acid is contained

at a concentration of 0.05 to 3 M, preferably in a
concentration of 0.1 to 0.5 M.
Sample treatment means according to one of Claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the amino acid is proline.
Sample treatment means according to one of Claims 1

to 5, characterised in that the means contains
polyethylene glycol as reaction accelerator.
Set for sample treatment for a lipoprotein-containing
sample and for immunochemical determination of 

an antigen contained therein, characterised in that a
first component of the means has a content of buffer

substance, of an amino acid and optionally of a reaction
accelerator and a second component of the means contains

antibodies against the antigen to be detected.
Set according to Claim 7, characterised in that the
amino acid is contained in a concentration of 0.05 to 3

M, preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 M in the first component of
the means.
Set according to one of Claims 7 or 8, characterised
in that the amino acid is proline.
Set according to one of Claims 7 to 9, characterised
in that the first component of the means contains

polyethylene glycol as reaction accelerator.
Set according to one of Claims 7 to 10,
characterised in that the second component of the means

contains antibodies against a lipoprotein.
Set according to one of Claims 7 to 11,
characterised in that the second component of the means

contains antibodies against Lp(a).
Process for immunochemical determination of an
antigen, characterised in that an amino acid is added to

a sample provided for the immunochemical determination,
then or simultaneously antibodies against the antigen to

be determined are introduced into the sample and the
antibody antigen complex formed is determined.
Process for diminishing or avoiding clouding in a
cloudy biological sample, characterised in that an amino

acid is added to the cloudy biological sample. 
Process according to one of Claims 13 or 14,
characterised in that the amino acid is proline.
Process according to one of Claims 13 to 15,
characterised in that the sample is a blood, serum or

plasma sample which, in some circumstances, is optically
cloudy because of a lipoprotein content.
Use of an amino acid for treating lipoprotein-containing
samples, preferably a sample provided for the

immunochemical determination of an antigen.
Use of proline for treating lipoprotein-containing
samples, preferably a sample provided for the

immunochemical determination of an antigen.
Use of an amino acid for reducing or avoiding
cloudiness in a biological liquid, preferably in a cloudy

lipoprotein-containing sample provided for the
immunochemical determination of an antigen.
Use of proline for reducing or avoiding cloudiness
in a biological liquid, preferably in a cloudy

lipoprotein-containing sample provided for the
immunochemical determination of an antigen.
