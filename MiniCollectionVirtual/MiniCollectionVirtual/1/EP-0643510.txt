<ABSTRACT>
In order to transmit blocks of data organised into frames of variable length and interlaced between a calling sender and a called receiver the method consists in having a reception acknowledgement (ACKNOWLEDGEMENT #) sent by the called receiver as soon as it has received, from the calling sender, a defined number of blocks forming a superframe, and in interrupting the sending from the calling sender at the instants of sending of the reception acknowledgement. Application: data transmission by radio channel.

<CLAIMS>
Process for automatic-repetition transmission
of data blocks using bit-rate-compatible punctured

codes (4) in half-duplex mode between a called (7) and
a calling (2) party in which the data blocks are

organized into variable-length and interleaved
frames, characterized in that it consists in having the

called party send an acknowledgement of receipt
(ACKNOWLEDGE #) as soon as it has received from the

calling party a specified number of blocks forming a
superframe and in having the transmission from the

calling sender interrupted at the instants of sending
of the acknowledgement of receipt.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it consists in sending an acknowledgement of

receipt report interleaved with the useful data over
the outbound link.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the data blocks are coded by a Reed-Solomon type

error-corrector detector code and protected by a
Hagenauer type convolutional code (3).
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that it consists in increasing the redundancy of the

data blocks transmitted by the calling party, through a
supplementary redundancy determined by puncture tables

(T
1
...T
5
), in the superframe which follows the instant
at which an acknowledgement of receipt ought to occur

when the calling party has not received the
acknowledgement of receipt.
