<ABSTRACT>
The present invention demonstrates a device in a housing (1) for the reliable pressurising or venting of a control line for air brakes in rail vehicles. The entire mechanism of the emergency brake pull case according to the invention is accommodated in the housing (1) and in addition to the mechanism there is an electrical switch (6) and a control valve (3) in the said case. The emergency brake case according to the invention is characterised by its simple construction and its operating reliability which, inter alia, lies in the fact that, once the device has been actuated, it can no longer be tampered with by unauthorised persons. The mechanism can be returned into its original position, that is into the position in which the control valve (3) is closed, only by means of a suitable guard's key.

<CLAIMS>
Device in a housing (1) for the reliable
pressurisation and release of pressure of a control

line (2) for compressed air brakes in rail vehicles, in
particular emergency brake tension boxes, having a

valve (3), a resetting element (4), a manual pull
handle (5), an electric switch (6) and a mechanism,

characterized by:

a recess (7) on a swing latch (8), which is
mounted articulatedly by means of a pin (9),
the swing latch (8) having a spherical friction
surface (10) near the recess (7) which abuts the

end surface (11) of a locking piston (12), wherein
the locking piston (12) is articulated by a pin
(13) on a multi-arm lever (14), and
the multi-arm lever (14) is secured articulatedly
by means of a pin (15) on the housing (1), wherein
the multi-arm lever (14) has gear teeth into
which the resetting element (4) engages and
the swing latch (8) is connected articulatedly
to the manual pull handle (5) by means of a pin

(17).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the valve (3) and the switch (6) are housed together

with the mechanism in a housing (1).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the manual pull handle (5) is fitted outside the

housing (1) by means of a securing element (18)
laterally of the housing (1).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the swing latch (8) is constructed like a fork at one

of its ends with a bore (19).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the swing latch (8) is mounted rotatably by means of a

pin (9), and a pin (17) secured against rotation is
located in the bore (19), whereby the swing latch (8)

is connected to the guide pin (21).
Device according to claim 1 and 5, characterised
in that pressure is exerted on the guide pin (21) by

means of a spring (22).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the locking piston (12) has a spherical surface

(24) inside the sliding bore (23).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the locking piston (12) has a bore (25) in the front

part, into which the pin (13) for securing to the
multi-arm lever (14) engages.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
one arm of the multi-arm lever (14) is of fork-like

construction and has three bores (27, 28, 29).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that one arm of the multi-arm lever

(14) actuates the switch (6).
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the bore (29) in the tip (30) of

the fork of the multi-arm lever (14) is penetrated by a
pin (31).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the gear teeth (16) on the multi-arm lever (14) are

arranged at a specific distance from the point of
rotation (15, 28).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the resetting element (4) has on its circumference at

least one tooth (26) for engagement into the teeth (16)
of the multi-arm lever (14).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that pressure is exerted on the

locking piston (12) by means of a compression spring
(32).
