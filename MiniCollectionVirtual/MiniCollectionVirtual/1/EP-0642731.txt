<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mowing machine intended 
for being coupled to a coupling device attached to the front 

side of a vehicle, the machine comprising first (13) and 
second (15) frame portions. The first frame portion (13) 

includes a coupling trestle (17) and a carrier structure (20, 
22) connected thereto, and the second frame portion (15) 

includes a frame beam (1) which extends at least 
substantially at a square angle to the direction of travel 

(A) and predominantly in a horizontal direction. To this 
frame beam (1) there is coupled at least one carrier (3) 

which is disposed at a lower level for mowing elements (4) 
which are rotatable via upwardly directed and motorically 

drivable shafts. The first (13) and second (15) frame 
portions are interconnected via a four-bar linkage (14) which 

is pivotal about shafts (26 - 29) which are arranged at least 
predominantly horizontally and transversely of the direction 

of travel (A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mowing machine 
intended for being coupled to a coupling device attached to 
the front side of a vehicle and having for its object to 
carry the machine, the machine comprising a first and a 
second frame portion, the first frame portion comprising a 
coupling trestle and a carrier structure connected thereto, 
and the second frame portion comprising a frame beam which 
extends at least substantially at a square angle to the 
direction of travel and in a predominantly horizontal 
direction, to which at least one carrier disposed at a lower 
level is coupled for accommodating mowing members which are 
rotatable via upwardly directed and motorically drivable 
shafts. Machines of this type are known. According to the 
invention, an advantageous embodiment of such machines is 
obtained, when the first and second frame portions are 
interconnected via a four-bar linkage which is pivotal about 
shafts which are arranged at least predominantly horizontally 
and transversely to the direction of travel. In addition, the invention has for its object to 
provide a further improvement of such machines. According to 
the invention, this can be achieved when the carrier and the 
major portion of the drive means intended for driving the 
mowing elements, are, taken in a side view, located at least 
predominantly between the leading and the trailing pivotal 
shafts of the lower connecting arms of the four-bar linkage. In accordance with another, also further  
 
improvement according to the invention, which can be 
implemented both separately and in combination with the said 
above mesure in the described prior art machine, it is 
advantageous that at least two arms of a set of four-bar 
linkage arms are interconnected by means of a torsion rod 
which comprises the pivotal shafts for the connection between 
the relevant four-bar linkage arms and the first frame 
portion, or is at least arranged thereabout in a concentric 
manner. This has the advantage that these two lateral motions 
of the second frame portion is limited relative to the first 
frame portion and that when the second frame portion deflects 
upwardly in front of an obstacle encountered at one end of 
the machine, also the other end of the machine is lifted 
upwardly in conjunction therewith. This last feature is of 
particular advantage when the drive of the machine is 
effected mainly via one end of the machine. In accordance with the invention, an advantageous 
embodiment of the machine further includes a carrier 
stru
