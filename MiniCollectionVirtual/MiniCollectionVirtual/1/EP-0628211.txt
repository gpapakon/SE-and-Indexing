<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
electrical fuses and particularly to surface mount fuses 
employing thin film technology. Surface mounting has become the preferred technique 
for circuit board assembly and virtually all types of 
electronic components have been or are being redesigned 
for surface mount, that is, leadless, applications. The 
rapid incorporation of surface mount devices (SMD) into 
all types of electronic circuits has created a demand for 
SMD fuses. Fuses serve an essential function on many circuit 
boards. By fusing selected sub-circuits and even certain 
individual components it is possible to prevent damage to 
an entire system which may result from failure of a local 
component. For example, fire damage to a mainframe 
computer can result from the failure of a tantalum 
capacitor; a short in a single line card might disable an 
entire telephone exchange. The required characteristics for circuit board fuses 
are small size, low cost, accurate current-sensing, very 
fast reaction or blow time and the ability, in the case 
of time lag fuses, to provide surge resistance. Existing tube type or leaded fuses take up excessive 
space on circuit boards designed for SMD assembly and add 
significantly to production costs. Recognizing the need 
for fuses compatible with SMD assembly techniques, 
several manufacturers offer leadless, molded fuses for 
standard SMD assembly. The devices provided by this 
approach, however, remain bulky (for example, package 
sizes of about 7 x 4 x 3 mm), expensive and of limited 
performance range. Most importantly, the characteristics  
 
of fuses of the prior art cannot be accurately controlled during manufacture. DE-C-3104419 discloses a method of manufacturing surface 
mount resistors in which a resistance layer is deposited on a surface of a substrate 
between 2 contact strips. The contact strips and the resistance layer are covered with 
a screen printed passivation layer. The substrate, prepared in this manner, is divided 
into strips having opposed planar surfaces exposing edge surfaces of the contact 
strips. Conducting termination's are applied over each end surface thereby connecting 
the termination to the edges of the contact portions exposed at the end surface. The 
strips are then divided into individual resisters. US-A-3, 358, 363 discloses a method of making fuse elements from 
a sheet of silver foil or the like in which the fuse elements are formed by 
photolithographic techniques. International patent application WO-A-89/08925

A method of manufacturing a surface mount 
electrical fuse (10), comprising the steps of: 


applying a thin metal film to a surface of an 
insulating substrate (12,50); 
removing selected portions of the thin metal 
film to define a repetitive pattern (56-1, 56-2, ...) 

comprising continuous rows of identical fuse elements, 
each fuse element comprising a pair of contact portions 

(20, 58) interconnected by at least one fusible link (22, 
60) having a width smaller than that of the contact 

portions; 
passivating the thin metal film and the 
adjacent surface of the substrate; 
bonding an insulating cover (26, 64) to the 
passivation layer (24, 62) formed by the preceding step; 
cutting the assembly formed by the preceding 
steps into strips (70) along planes (68-1, 68-2, ...) 

normal to the surface of the substrate (50), each strip 
thereby including opposed end planar surfaces (32, 72) 

formed by the cutting operation and a series of side-by-side 
fuses extending between the end surfaces, and an 

edge (36) of one of the contact portions (20, 58) of each 
fuse element being thereby exposed at each of said end 

surfaces (32, 72); 
applying a conductive termination (38, 73) over 
each end surface (32, 72) thereby electrically connecting 

each termination to the edges (36) of the contact 
portions (20, 48) exposed at the end surface (32, 72); 

and 
cutting the strips into individual fuses. 
A method of manufacturing a surface mount 
fuse, as de
fined in claim 1, in which the application of 
the terminations includes the steps of: 


applying a conductive layer (40, 74) to each 
end surface (32, 72); and 
coating the conductive layer (40, 84) with 
solder (42, 80). 
A method of manufacturing a surface mount 
fuse, as defined in claim 1, in which the strips include 

corners (34, 76) bounding the end planar surfaces (32, 
72) and which includes the step of:
 
   applying the termination to extend around said 

corners. 
A method of manufacturing a surface mount 
fuse, as defined in claim 3, in which the substrate and 

cover are glass and in which the application of the 
terminations includes the steps of: 


depositing on each end planar surface (32, 72) 
a highly conductive metallic layer (40, 74); and 
depositing over said layer a low melting point 
metallic layer (42), said low melting point metal wetting 

said first mentioned layer but not said glass layers, 
such that when the temperature of the fuse during use 

thereof rises to the melting point of the low melting 
point metal, the first mentioned layer dissolves in the 

low melting point metal causing electrical 
discontinuities to occur in the termination. 
A method of manufacturing a surface mount 
electrical fuse (10) comprising the steps of: 


depositing a thin conductive film on a surface 
of an insulating substrate (12, 50); 
removing selected portions of said film to

elements, each of said fuse elements comprising a pair of 
contact portions (20, 58) interconnected by at least one 

fusible link (22, 60) having a width smaller than that of
