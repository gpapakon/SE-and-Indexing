<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane which comprises hydrogenating 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-chloropropene 
with hydrogen in vapor phase in the presence of a noble metal catalyst. This process serves to produce readily at a low cost 

1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane, which is useful and does not cause environmental destruction (i.e. is capable of environmental protection), 
from an inexpensive starting material in one stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the method of producing 
1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane at low cost, which is a hydrofluorocarbon 
having no fear of destroying ozone layer and 
may be substituted for chlorofluorocarbons which have been 
used as working fluids and blowing agents. Until now, 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane is known to be 
sythesized by the following steps; hexafluoropropene is 
hydrogenated into hexafluoropropane, then the product is 
dehydrofluorinated by reacting it with an alkali aqueous 
solution to produce pentafluoropropene, and finaly the 
pentafluoropropene is hydrogenated again. However, this 
reaction is a multistage reaction and complicated. Moreover, 
hexafluoropropene as a raw material is expensive. This invention is aimed at offering a method of easily 
producing 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane at low cost, which is 
useful as a working fluid and so on, and has a property to  
 
help preserving the environment. As a result of eagerly studying of efficient methods of 
1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane, the inventor found a reduction 
catalyst by which 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane can be 
selectively derived from easily available 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-chloropropene 
at high selectivity in one step, 
having reached this invention. That is, this invention relates to a production method 
of 1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane that is characteristic of 
hydrogenating 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-chloropropene by 
hydrogen in a gas phase in the presence of a noble metal 
catalyst. In the production process of this invention, the above-mentioned 
noble metal catalyst is desirable to be such a 
catalyst as one or more than one kind of metals selected 
from platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd),rhodium (Rh), and 
ruthenium (Ru) which are carried on a carrier. In this case, the carrier is active carbon or alumina. 
And the above-mentioned noble metal catalyst is desirable to 
be palladium catalyst carried on active carbon made from 
coconut shell. In the production process of this invention, the 
reaction temperature of the above-mentioned hydrogenation is  
 
desirable to be from 30 to 500째C. The invention will be explained in more detail. To execute the production process of this invention, 
the raw material 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-chloropropene is 
introduced into a reactor, which is filled with a reduction 
catalyst shown below (a noble metal catalyst) and is kept at 
a temperature properly chosen from the range of 30 to 500째C 
(preferablly of 50 to 300째C), together with hydrogen of 1.5 
to 10 times, preferablly 2 to
