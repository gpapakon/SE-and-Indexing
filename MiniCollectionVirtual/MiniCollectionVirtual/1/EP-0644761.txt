<DESCRIPTION>
 HYDROXYPYRIDIN-4-ONES FOR TREATMENT OF PARASITICAL INFECTIONSThis invention relates to 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one chelating agents of value in the treatment of parasitic infections and in particular to the treatment of malaria and other conditions in which the parasite is iron dependent. Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) show a complex pattern of development in the mammalian host. Infection is initiated when female mosquitoes feeding on blood inoculate sporozoites into the bloodstream from whence they enter the liver. The parasites proliferate in the liver and are ultimately released therefrom in the mature form, known as merozoites, which initiate the asexual erythrocytic cycle which causes the disease. The parasites, once taken up as merozoites by the red blood cells, pass through various stages, including the trophozoite and schizont stages, which culminate in the rupture of the blood cells with the release of much increased numbers of merozoites, thereby perpetuating the cycle.Malaria presents a very considerable medical problem, despite the development of various drugs for its treatment. This is particularly the case since, of the different species of Plasmodium responsible for malaria in humans, J_. falciparum is the species which causes the most morbidity and mortality and is at the same time the one which poses most problems by way of resistance to the preferred therapeutic agent, chloroquine.UK Patent No. 2 136 807 and various scientific papers describe the use of 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones for the treatment of iron overload arising from various causes, particularly that arising from the treatment of pathological conditions such as thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia, idiopathic haemochromatosis and aplastic anaemia by regular blood transfusions. Moreover, in addition to use for the treatment of general iron overload, the3-hydroxpyridin-4-ones are of interest for use in certain pathological conditions where there may be an excess of iron deposited at certain sites even though the patient does not exhibit 

a general iron overload, this being the case, for example, in certain arthritic and cancerous conditions.Although the major use described in the literature for these compounds is in the removal of iron, they are also of potential interest for the removal of other metals present in the body in deleterious amounts, for example copper, plutonium and other related transuranic metals, and especially aluminium.The 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones are also of interest for use in certain other contexts. Thus the

<CLAIMS>
 CLAIMS 1 . The use in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of a condition caused by an i ron dependent parasite of a 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one of formula ( I)
(i) in which Ri is a C3 or C4 hydroxyalkyl group in which the hydroxy group is terminally substituted on the alkyl group, R2 is methyl or ethyl and R3 and R4 are each separately hydrogen, methyl or ethyl but with the proviso that the total number of carbon atoms in R-
j
 to R4 is no more than six, the compound optionally being in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt and/or pro-drug thereof. 2. The use according to Claim 1, in which R3 and R4 are each hydrogen.
3. The use according to Claim 1 or 2, in which R2 is methyl.
4. The use according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, in which R-j is a C3 hydroxyalkyl group. 5. The use according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, in which R] is a straight chain hydroxyalkyl group.
6. The use according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, in which R-| is 3-hydroxypropyl.
7. The use according to Claim 1, in which the compound of formula (I) is 3-hydroxy-l-(3-hydroxypropy!)-2-methylpyridin-4-one.
8. The use according to Claim 1, in which the compound of formula (I) is 3-hydroxy-l-(4-hydroxybutyl)-2-methylpyridin-4-one.
9. The use according to Claim 1, in which the compound of formula (I) is 2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-l-(3-hydroxypropyl)pyridin-4-one. 


10. The use according to Claim 1, in which the compound of formula (I) is 2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-l-(4-hydroxybutyl)pyridin-4-one.
11. The use according to any of Claims 1 to 10, in which the medicament is for use in the treatment of malaria.
12. A medicament for treating a condition caused by an iron dependent parasite comprising as an active ingredient a 3-hydroxypyrid-4-one of formula (I)
(I) in which R^ is a C3 or C4 hydroxyalkyl group in which the hydroxy group is terminally substituted on the alkyl group, R2 is methyl or ethyl and R3 and R4 are each separately hydrogen, methyl or ethyl but with the proviso that the total number of carbon atoms in R-j to R4 is no more than six, the compound optionally being in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt and/or pro-drug thereof. 13. A method for the treatment of a patient having a condition caused by an iron dependent parasite which comprises administering to that patient a therapeutically effective amount of a 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one of formula (I)

 (i) 


in which R~ is a C3 or C4 hydroxyalkyl group in which the hydroxy group is terminally substituted on the alkyl group, R2 is methyl or ethyl and R3 and R4 are each separately hydrogen, methyl or ethyl but with the proviso that the total number of carbon atoms in R-
