<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to co-pending EP patent application No. 
EP-A-0 644 362 , titled FORCED ENGAGEMENT LOGIC, 
and assigned to the same assignee, Eaton Corporation, as this 
application. This invention relates to vehicular automatic or partially automatic 
compound mechanical transmission systems having a main section and an 
auxiliary section connected in series therewith and, in particular, to 
automated compound mechanical transmission systems of the range type 
wherein two selectable range ratios are engaged bv a double-acting 
synchronized jaw clutch. More particularly, the present invention relates to a control 
system/method which enhances recovery from unintended non-engagement 
conditions in the synchronized range section of an automated mechanical 
compound range-type transmission. Fully automatic transmission systems, both for heavy-duty vehicles 
such as heavy-duty trucks, and for automobiles, that sense throttle openings 
or positions, vehicle speeds, engine speeds, transmission shaft speeds and 
the like, and automatically shift the vehicle transmission in accordance 
therewith, are well known in the prior art. Such fully automatic change gear 
transmission systems include automated transmissions wherein pressurized 
fluid is utilized to frictionally engage one or more members to other members 
or to a ground to achieve a selected gear ratio as well as automated 
mechanical transmissions utilizing electronic and/or pneumatic logic and 
actuators to engage and disengage mechanical (i.e., positive) c!utches to  
 
achieve a desired gear ratio. Examples of such transmissions may be seen 
by reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 3,961,546; 4,081,065 and 4,361,060. Semi-automatic transmission systems utilizing electronic control units 
which sense throttle position, engine, input shaft, main shaft, output shaft 
and/or vehicle speed, and utilize automatically controlled fuel throttle 
devices, gear shifting devices and/or master clutch operating devices to 
substantially fully automatically implement operator manually selected 
transmission ratio changes are known in the prior art. Examples of such 
semi-automatic transmission systems may be seen by reference to U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,425,620; 4,631,679 and 4,648,290. Semi-automatic shift implementation systems/methods for mechanical 
transmission systems for use in vehicles having a manually only controlled 
engine throttle means and/or a manually only controlled master clutch, have 
been proposed. Such systems may be seen by reference to U.S.

A control system for controlling shifting of a two-speed 
transmission section (14) comprising a double-acting synchronized jaw 

clutch assembly (92), including an axially movable two-sided jaw clutch 
member (93) fixed for rotation with a first shaft (90) and having a first axial 

position relative to said first shaft for engaging a first selectable ratio (88) 
and a second axial position relative to said first shaft for engaging a second 

selectable ratio (86), movement of said axially movable jaw clutch member 
toward each of said first and second axial positions initially causing 

engagement of synchronizer friction surfaces (93A) carried by said axially 
movable jaw clutch member with synchronizer friction surfaces (86A, 88A) 

carried by second jaw clutch members rotating with a second shaft (28) 
prior to positive engagement of the engaging first and second jaw clutch 

members, said system including: 

means to sense selection of engagement of one of said 
transmission section ratios;

(a) causing said axially movable jaw clutch member to move 
axially toward the axial position thereof associated with 

engagement of the non-selected ratio,

movable jaw clutch member toward to axial position

ratio, and 
(c) upon sensing engagement of the synchronizer friction 
surfaces engageable upon axial movement of said axially  

 
movable jaw clutch member toward the axial position 

thereof associated with engagement of the non-selected

move toward the axial position thereof associated with 
engagement of said selected speed ratio.
