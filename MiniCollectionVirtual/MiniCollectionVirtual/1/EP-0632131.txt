<ABSTRACT>
The drug sensitivity of a bacterium is judged by adding a 
specimen containing it to each of a solution containing an antibacterial 

and another solution containing no antibacterial and 
examining whether or not there is any substantial difference in 

dissolved oxygen concentration between both the solutions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This present invention relates to an
antibacterial drug inspection method and apparatus
therefor, and more particularly, this present invention
relates to a method and apparatus for inspecting whether
or not bacteria which is a cause of infectious disease
and the like has drug sensitivity to specific
antibacterial drug.When medical care for infectious disease which
is caused by bacteria is performed in clinical
iatrology, it is widely employed as a general medical
care method that dosage of antibacterial drug
(antibiotic resistance, bactericidal drug and the like)
to which bacteria causing infectious disease has drug 
sensitivity. But, it must be recognized prior to dosing
the antibacterial drug that bacteria causing infectious
disease has drug sensitivity to the antibacterial drug.
Because, it is known that following general usage of
antibiotic resistance, for example, for medical care of
infectious disease, resistance bacteria having
resistance to such antibiotic resistance appears. And
because, when the most recent antibiotic resistance is
applied to bacteria which has no resistance to all
antibiotic resistance, resistance bacteria appears which
has resistance to the most recent antibiotic resistance.Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measuring
method established by Nihon Kagaku Ryouhou Gakkai and a
method using liquid medium are proposed as drug
sensitivity inspection method for satisfying such
demand.The MIC measuring method is a method for
inoculating bacteria by concentration of 106
articles/ml, for example, onto a agar medium including
antibacterial resisrance by predetermined concentration,
which bacteria is incubated for a predetermined time in
another medium, for incubating the bacteria inoculated
onto the agar medium for a predetermined time (about 18-20
hours), and for judging drug sensitivity of the
corresponding bacteria by visually judging whether or 
not colonies are generated. Consequently, it is
accurately judged that whether or not bacteria has drug
sensitivity and that a degree of drug sensitivity of the
bacteria, by preparing plural agar medium, antibacterial
drug concentration of each agar medium being different
from one another.The method using liquid medium is a method for
performing MIC method using liquid medium instead of the
agar medium. The method judges whether or not bacteria
has drug sensitivity and degree of drug sensitivity of
the bacteria based upon turbidity of the liquid medium,
variation in pH and the like.Because any one of both above-mentioned methods
is MIC

<CLAIMS>
An inspection method for an antibacterial drug, comprising
the steps of:


introducing an antibacterial drug into a first liquid in which
bacteria exist,
detecting dissolved oxygen quantity on the first liquid and in a
second liquid, in which bacteria but no antibacterial drug exist,

determining whether or not the dissolved oxygen quantity varies in
the first liquid, with respect to the dissolved oxygen quantity in

the second liquid,
deciding that bacteria are drug sensitive to the corresponding antibacterial
drug only when dissolved oxygen quantity in the first

liquid varies with respect to the dissolved oxygen quantity in the
second liquid, and
introducing a respiration interfering drug into the first and
second liquids in which bacteria exist.
An antibacterial drug inspection method as set forth in claim
1, further comprising the step of:


introducing a bacteria non-sensitive respiration interfering drug
into the first and second liquids in which bacteria exist.
An inspection apparatus for an antibacterial drug,
comprising:


at least two culture cell means (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) including a first
and a second culture cell means (2a, 2b),
test solution injection means (1) for supplying a liquid in which
bacteria exist to each culture cell means,

characterized by: 
a plurality of oxygen electrode means (3) each corresponding to
each culture cell means, and
comparing means (4) for comparing whether or not an output signal
from the oxygen electrode means (3) for the liquid of the first

culture cell means (2a) is different from an output signal from
the oxygen electrode means (3) for the liquid of the second culture

cell means (2b),
wherein antibacterial drug is absent in only the second culture
cell means (2b), and
wherein all culture
cell means (2c, 2d) comprise a respiration interfering drug

therein.
The apparatus as set forth in claim 3, wherein all culture
cell means (2c, 2d) comprise a bacteria non-sensitive respiration

interfering drug therein.
