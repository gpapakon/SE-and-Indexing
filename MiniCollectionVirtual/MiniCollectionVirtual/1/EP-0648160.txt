<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, the supply (11) of an adhesion and release agent respectively to the surface of a Yankee-cylinder (1) from which the paper web is removed with the aid of a doctor blade (5) is controlled as a function of a signal from a gauge (20) which measures web tension and which is located between the cylinder (1) and the device (7, 8, 9) by means of which the web is rolled-up. When the degree of crêping is constant, an increase or decrease in web tension indicates that adhesion has increased or decreased respectively, resulting in a change in the setting of the supply device (11, 12). The invention also relates to a suitable web tension gauge to this end.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method of measuring and controlling adhesion/release of a paper web which is removed by a doctor blade from a Yankee cylinder . and a web tension gaugeThe present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of Claim 1 and an arrangement according to the preamble of Claim 6.In the manufacture of more or less crepe-type paper, such as toilet paper, tissue paper, cellulose wadding and similar soft paper products, the wet paper web is placed on a large drying cylinder, a so-called Yankee- cylinder, from which the paper web is then removed by means of a doctor blade and rolled into rolls. The peripheral speed of the drying cylinder is somewhat higher than the speed of the downstream web and the pro¬ portional difference between these speeds can be defined as---the-^-degre~e-:--σf*--crepi riψ ^Cffi ~preϊe'quϊ^ϊ't"er^fd * r6^ manufacture of such papers is that the paper web adheres to the surface of the drying cylinder during the drying process, although this adhesion must neither be too strong nor too weak. The extent to which the web will adhere to the drying cylinder is influenced by the quality of the pulp, the additive substances present therein, e.g. softeners, and also by the nature of the surface of the drying cylinder itself. It is well known to treat this surface continuously, by spraying the same with appropriate chemicals at a position between the doctor blade and the location at which the wet paper web is applied to the cylinder. It is also possible to coat the actual web itself, prior to applying the same, for instance as the web passes a felt, or the felt itself can be treated with such chemicals, which are then taken-up by the web as it comes into contact with the felt. The essential criterion is that these chemicalsSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 will be applied to the cylinder surface.One advantageous method of applying such chemicals is described in U.S. 4,448,818, according to which chemi- cals are sprayed in the form of airborne droplets, i.e. in an aerosol form. One embodiment hereof is sold by Leckners Verkstads AB, Jδnkδping, Sweden, which enables the application of two different chemicals in desired, controllable mixing proportions, e.g. to thereby in- crease adhesion or facilitate release.Efficient operation of present-day machines of this kind depends greatly on the expertise of the machine operator and on many years of practice. The operator is able to observe the amount of waste removed by the cleansing doctor blade located downstream of the web-removing blade in order to judge

Claims
1. A method of controlling adhesion/release of a paper web (1) removed from a Yankee-cylinder (4) with the aid of a doctor blade (5) , said web being taken-up up on a roll (9) under a specific degree of creping, wherein the paper web has a web-part which is drawn freely between the doctor blade and the roll, and with the aid of a device (11, 12) which functions to deliver a substance between the paper web and the Yankee-cylinder for con¬ trolling web adhesion/web release, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d by exerting a deformation force (via 20) to the paper web at a local part of the freely drawn web-part; detecting the resultant positional change at said local web-part so as to obtain an electric signal corresponding to the tension in the paper web; and passing said signal to a control unit (13) for control¬ ling the supply of said substance to control adhesion/ release between the paper web and the Yankee-cylinder.
2. A method according to Claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d by controlling the ratio between the peripheral speed of the Yankee-cylinder and the speed of the paper web subsequent to its removal from the cylin¬ der in a manner to maintain said ratio essentially con¬ stant.
3. A method according to Claim 1, c h a r a c - t e r i z e d by exerting said deformation force by means of an air jet.
4. A method according to Claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d by exerting the deformation force through the medium of air ejected through an opening in a sur¬ face which is moveable towards and away from the paper 


web and which is arranged on one end of a telescopic piston device (23) which is movable towards the paper web through the action of compressed air and which is accommodated in a stationary cylinder device (21) , said electric signal being derived from a position determin¬ ing device which determines or measures the relative position between the piston device and the cylinder device.
5. A method according to Claim 4, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d by delivering compressed air through a constriction (27) of the piston device, such that com¬ pressed air is ejected therefrom through the opening provided in said surface.
6. An arrangement for contactless measuring the tension in a paper web, particularly for carrying out the method according to Claim 1, said arrangement including nozzle means for spraying air onto a moveable paper web, and means for measuring web movement caused thereby, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by a fixedly mounted holder (22), a mushroom-like nozzle part (23, 24) having a shaft (23) and arranged telescopically in the form of a piston in said holder; means (25) for delivering compressed air at stable pressure to the holder (21) so as to exert an outwardly acting pressure on the shaft (23) of said nozzle part and for ejecting air (27) from the nozzle part (22) in a direction opposite to its shaft (23); and means (28, 29) for determining the extent to which the shaft (23) is extended and to produce an electric signal (30) corresponding to the extent to which the shaft (23) is displaced.
7. An arrangement according to Claim 6, c h a r a c - t e r i z e d in that the end of the nozzle part remote from the shaft has provided thereon a skirt part (24) 


which is directed towards said shaft and which lies outside a part of the fixedly mountable holder which projects into said skirt to an extent which corresponds to the extent to which the shaft (23) is extended.
8. An arrangement according to Claim 6, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the means for determining the extent of shaft movement includes a magnet (28) fixed to the piston device and a Hall-effect detector (29) mount- ed centrally opposite the magnet.
