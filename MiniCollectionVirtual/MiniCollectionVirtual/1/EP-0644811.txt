<ABSTRACT>
In a device for electrical discharge machining a workpiece (4) inside a hermetically closed container (12) having a dielectric capable of being supplied and removed in particular under pressure, the container (12) has at least two parts (6, 14a, 14b, 14c) capable of sliding on each other. In particular, the parts are designed as telescopically nestable rings (14). At least two parts (86, 14a) are further interconnectable and detachable from each other by a quick acting closing system.

Electro-erosive device with a centre sleeve (10) 
for displacing the working electrode (2) in the Z 

direction and with a container (12) closable on all 
sides, which: 


a) is designed for receiving a workpiece (4) and a 
liquid which may be fed and returned particularly under 

pressure (P), and further has: 
b) a base member (6) carrying the workpiece (4), 
c) and a cover member (14a, 14b, 14c), which 

c1) engages slidingly and movably about the 
centre sleeve (10) and 
c2) is connectable to and detachable from the 
base member (6) in a friction-locking manner via a 

closure system, 
 
characterised in that 
d) the cover member (14a, 14c, 14b) comprises further 
part members (14a; 14b; 14c), which are slidingly 

movable one on the other. 
Electro-erosive device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the cover member (14a, 14c, 14b) 

movably and slidingly engages about the centre sleeve  
 

(10) directly or via an intermediate part (14c) rigidly 
attached to the centre sleeve (10). 
Electro-erosive device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the base member (6) is a machine 

bench. 
Electro-erosive device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the part 

members (14a; 14b; 14c) slidingly movable relative to 
one another are designed as annular members of varying 

diameters which may be pushed one into the other 
axially and telescopically. 
Electro-erosive device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the annular members (14a, 14b, 

14c), seen in a cross-sectional view, through the plane 
of which the ring axis extends, are step-like. 
Electro-erosive device according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the part members (14a, 14b, 14c) 

have a portion (22) cylindrical to the ring axis, on 
both ends of which there connect annular disc-like 

portions (20, 24), one of the two annular disc-like 
portions (20) being aligned radially outwardly relative 

to the cylindrical portion, and the other annular disclike 
portion being aligned radially inwards (24).  

 
Electro-erosive device according to one of claims 
3 to 6, characterised in that the part member (14c) 

engaging around the centre sleeve (10) has a second 
inner cylindrical portion (26) the inner side of which 

is slidingly attached to the centre sleeve (10) of the 
erosive device. 
Electro-erosive device according to one of claims 
4 to 7, characterised in that the step-like part 

members (14a, 14b, 14c) are provided at their inner 
and/or outer peripheral edge with one or more seals 

(28). 
Electro-erosive device according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the external edge seals (28) 

respectively seal the outer edge of the outer annular 
disc-like portion (20) of a part member (14a, 14b, 14c) 

of smaller diameter against the inner edge of the 
cylindrical portion (20) of the respectively next 

largest part member (14a, 14b, 14c). 
Electro-erosive device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the workpiece 

(4) is movably guided in the Z direction.
