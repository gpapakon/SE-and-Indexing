<ABSTRACT>
The method and apparatus for startup control of a polyolefine polymerization 
reactor of the present invention determines an olefine feed rate based on a reaction 

amount set by the heat balance within the polyolefine polymerization reactor, a reaction 
balance amount calculated from its unreacted amount and dynamic compensation 

amount, and the olefine concentration within the polyolefine polymerization reactor. 
Due to this, model errors are reduced, and the practical application of feed-forward 
control is possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus necessary for the
startup control of a polyolefine polymerization reactor which produces polyolefines by
repeated polymerization of olefines such as ethylene.Generally, the concentration of olefines inside a polyolefine polymerization
reactor (hereafter referred to simply as the olefine concentration) has a substantial effect
on the catalytic activity.Therefore, the control of the olefine concentration is necessary in order to
prevent any unwanted reactions due to the increase in catalytic activity or decrease in the
operational efficiency due to a lowered catalytic activity state. Furthermore, in the case
in which olefines are polymerized with the presence of either one of or both chain
transfer agents and comonomers, then the ratio between the chain transfer agent
concentration and the olefine concentration and the ratio between the comonomer
concentration and the olefine concentration also have a substantial effect on the physical
properties of the polyolefine. That is, it is necessary to control the olefine concentration
from a product quality control standpoint as well.During steady operation in which constant operating conditions are maintained,
feedback control methods, such as PID control, or control methods using models
calculated from the material balance of the olefines are commonly used. However, in
non-steady operation, such as during startup, since the reaction rate and the olefine
concentration change non-linearly, it has been impossible to put into practice a stable
and robust control of the olefine concentration.In this case, startup refers to the process of gradually increasing the feed rate of
catalysts and olefines from a state in which there are no reactions to a target state of
steady operation wherein a desired rate of polymerization is taking place.Previously, when performing the startup of a polyolefine polymerization
reactor, a method was used in which a skilled operator used specifically for this task
was employed to change the feed rate of catalysts and olefines and other operational 
rates depending on the state of the polymerization reaction based on his own
experience.However, the polymerization reaction rate is determined by the temperature of
the reaction mixture, the concentration of catalysts, the catalytic activity, and the
concentration of olefines. Therefore, during the startup, when the feed rate of olefines
and the feed rate of catalysts is changing over time, the concentration of olefines and the
reaction
