<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the production of moulded objects, in particular optical lenses, specifically contact lenses (CL), a starting material which can be crosslinked by exposure to suitable energy is introduced into a mould which is at least partially permeable to the energy concerned and has a mould cavity (15). The starting material is introduced in an at least partially still uncrosslinked state into the mould cavity, which defines the shape of the moulded object (CL) to be produced. By exposure to the energy concerned, the starting material is crosslinked to an extent adequate for the demouldability of the moulded object (CL). The filling of the mould cavity is performed with the starting material in an at least partially still uncrosslinked state.
