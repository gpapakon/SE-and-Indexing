<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyimide, and more
particularly to a thermoplastic and amorphous polyimide, a
preparation process thereof, and an aromatic diamino compound used
for preparing said polyimide and a preparation process of the diamino
compound.The invention further relates to a polyimide-based resin
composition comprising the polyimide and a fibrous reinforcement.The aromatic diamino compound of the invention is useful as a raw
material of polyimide of the invention and can also be applied to the
raw material of polyamide, polyamideimide, bismaleimide and epoxy
resin.Polyimide is excellent in mechanical properties, chemical
resistance, flame retardance and electrical properties in addition to
its essentially excellent heat resistance, and thus conventionally has
broad use in the field of forming materials, composite materials and
electric · electronic appliances.For example, a representative polyimide which has been known is
Kapton and Vespel (Trade Mark of E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co.) which
have recurring structural units of the formula (A) :
The polyimide, however, is insoluble and infusible and thus must be
formed by using a specific technique such as sinter molding by way of
polyamic acid precursor. Such a difficulty results in problem in the
processing step and it is thus difficult to obtain articles of a
complex shape. Consequently, finishing operation such as cutting is
additionally required in order to obtain satisfactory articles and
causes a serious defect of high processing cost.Another type of polyimide which has been known as amorphous and
thermoplastic polyimide having an improved processability is Ultem
(Trade Mark of General Electric Co.) which has recurring structural
units of the formula (B).

(USP. 3,847,867 and 3,847,869)The polyimide, however, has a glass transition temperature
(hereinafter referred to as Tg) of 215°C and thus heat resistance is
unsatisfactory.The present inventors have found that polyimide having recurring
structural units of the formula (C) :

is thermoplastic while maintaining heat resistance, solvent resistance
and mechanical properties which are essential properties of polyimide 
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent SHO 62-205124, and HEI 1-110530 and 1-123830).The polyimide, however, is essentially crystalline and causes
crystallization by specific treatment.Further, the present inventors have introduced recurring structural
units obtained by using a compound of the formula (D) :

as a second diamine component into polyimide having recurring
