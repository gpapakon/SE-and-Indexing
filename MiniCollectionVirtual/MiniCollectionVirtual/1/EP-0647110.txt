<ABSTRACT>
A device for holding garment hangers is described which has two parts: one preferably inflexible hook part made of plastics material or metal shaped to be carried by a rail, and a flexible loop or strap or series of loops, adapted to receive many garment hangers. The two parts are connected flexibly and the loop may be adjusted to alter its separation from a rail. The device allows more garments to be hung from a single rail than previously was possible and is particularly useful in the transport and storage of garments in shops, warehouses and factories. Two devices may be interlocked across a handler's shoulders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for holding 
garment hangers, particularly for hanging garments on a 
rail. The number of garments which can be hung on any one 
rail is traditionally limited by the bulk of the hangers 
used. The modern trend for shoulder pads in many garments 
also adds to the bulk and reduces the space available. There are known devices which aim to increase the 
hanging capacity of a rail but none are as advantageous as 
that of the present invention. US 5 050 833 describes a device with a first part made 
of an extruded metal rod bent into a hook at one end and a 
loop at the other end. The hook is threaded with roller 
bearings to support the device on a rail. The loop carries 
a rope sling knotted at intervals to support a plurality of 
garment hangers at positions below the rail thus increasing 
the number of hangers which can be carried by the rail. 
However this known device cannot coexist effectively on the 
rail with ordinary garment hangers since the roller bearings 
ride over and tangle with ordinary hangers. Also the rope 
sling does not provide any lateral support for the hangers 
so as to orient them in a direction perpendicular to the 
rail. They are instead free to adopt any of a variety of 
orientations and must be arranged manually by a user into 
the most convenient orientation for the application. The 
use of bent metal is a disadvantage making the device 
relatively weak and difficult to carry in a user's hand. US 4 091 976 suggests a device with a bent metal hook 
part for hanging on a rail and a flexible rope loop part for  
 
holding a plurality of garment hangers. Again no 
substantial support is given to orient the plurality of 
hangers satisfactorily and no means is suggested to 
facilitate manual carrying of the loaded device. Use of 
metal makes the known device relatively weak and expensive 
to manufacture. US 4 153 189 suggests a C-shaped gripping bar to be 
held in a hand, attached to a strap for supporting a 
plurality of garment hangers. However this device is not 
designed to slide easily on a rail, and since the strap 
holds the hangers by being wound or tangled around them it 
provides no lateral support to put the hangers in the 
correct orientation, nor does it allow easy withdrawal of 
any one hanger when required. US 3 633 801 has a carrying handle and a garment hanger 
support but is not adapted to carry a plurality of garment 
hangers. US 4 893 715 describes an inflexible ladder arrangement 
which can be hung on a rail to increase the

<CLAIMS>
A device for holding garment hangers so as to 
increase the number of hangers which can be carried by a 

rail, the device comprising a first part (1) formed of 
substantially rigid plastics material and being in the form 

of a hook (2) and a ring (4) spaced from the hook (2) and a 
second part comprising a loop (3) of flexible webbing 

attached to the first part through the ring (4), 
the hook (2) having an arcuate lower surface 

characterised by 
the fact that said surface is shaped and adapted to be carried directly 

on a rail adjacent to garment hangers hung directly on the rail and 
the loop (3) having two parallel side walls extending 

generally in the same plane as the hook (2) and providing 
lateral support for garment hangers in the loop (3) to keep 

them in an orientation substantially parallel to the garment 
hangers hung directly on the rail. 
A device according to claim 1, wherein the second 
part is adjustable to alter the separation of the loop (3) 

from the first part (1). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the second part comprises a plurality of 

loops (3). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the first part is a hook (2) in the form of 

a closed loop for permanent attachment to a rail. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the first part comprises latched element for  

 
resisting inadvertent displacement from a rail. 
A method of hanging garments from a rail, 
comprising using a device according to any one of the 

preceding claims. 
A method of hanging garments from a rail, 
comprising hanging two devices according to any one of 

claims 1 to 5, at spaced positions on a rail and suspending 
a second rail by means of the loops of the two spaced 

devices.
