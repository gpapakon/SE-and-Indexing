<ABSTRACT>
A carbon dioxide absorber is made by separating sludge 
from exhaust water discharged upon manufacturing fresh mixed 

concrete or concrete secondary products, then dewatering the 
separate
d sludge, and drying and crushing the dewatered 
sludge into dry fine particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a method for manufacturing
a carbon dioxide absorber
using sludge which is discharged
typically as a result of manufacturing fresh mixed concrete
or concrete secondary products, and also relates to a method
for absorbing carbon dioxide contained in exhaust gas by
using sludge.The cement- or concrete-related industries discharge
exhaust water including sludge, as result of manufacturing
fresh mixed concrete or concrete secondary products, or
washing concrete mixers, hoppers, agitator trucks or wet dust
collectors. Such sludge-containing exhaust water includes 60
percent of cement particles of a mean grain size of 10Âµm or
less and their hydrate, such as particles of calcium
hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), and exhibits a strong alkali.Heretofore, sludge-containing exhaust water has been
treated by separating it into solid components and water by
using a precipitator, a filter press or other appropriate
equipment, so as to dispose the solid components as a waste
and to reuse or release the water after pH adjustment using
sulfuric acid (H2S04), hydrochloric acid (HCl), carbon
dioxide (CO2), or the like.A conventional system for treatment of such exhaust
water is outlined below with reference to Fig. 3 which has
been taken from "Simple Knowledge on Cement and Concrete" (by
Junji Yamada et al., Kajima Shuppankai, February 10, 1983, p.
256). Fig. 3 shows a treatment process of such exhaust
water. Sludge-containing water discharged after cleaning of 
a plant such as mixers, hoppers, etc. (1) and that discharged
after cleaning agitator trucks (2) are treated by a solid
separating process. Solid components, such as ballast and
sand, separated from the sludge-containing water are held as
reusable materials, and the remainder water is sent to a
subsequent treatment step, that is, a precipitating/separating
step (6). Also, exhaust water from wet dust collectors
(4) and that used for watering factory facilities and
aggregates (5) are collected, and sent to the precipitating/separating
step (6). Supernatant water, obtained in the
precipitating/separating step (6) and not containing sludge
and other solid components, is pH-adjusted in a neutralizing
step (7), and released thereafter. Another part of the
exhaust water obtained in the precipitating/separating step
(6) and including solid components and a certain amount of
water is adjusted in concentration to be reused for making
concrete. The other part of the exhaust water obtained in
the precipitating/separating step (6) and consisting of
sludge is

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing a carbon dioxide absorber comprising
the steps of:


separating sludge from exhaust water discharged upon manufacturing
fresh mixed concrete or concrete secondary products such as water after

washing concrete manufacturing plants or water after washing agitator
trucks;
dewatering the separated sludge; and
drying and micronizing the dewatered sludge.
