<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating an aircraft bypass turbofan 
engine having variable fan outlet guide vanes. In a 

first embodiment, an engine out condition is sensed, 
fan rotor speed is repeatedly measured, and vane (52) pitch 

is adjusted to a predetermined value as a function of 
the fan rotor speed to generally maximize airflow 

through the vanes during the engine out condition. In 
a second embodiment, vane pitch is adjusted to a 

preselected value as a function of fan rotor speed to 
generally minimize engine noise during a noi
se 
reduction mode of engine operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a type
of gas turbine engine known as an aircraft bypass
turbofan engine, and more particularly to a method of
operating the engine for an engine out condition and
for engine noise reduction.A gas turbine engine includes a core engine having
a high pressure compressor to compress the air flow
entering the core engine, a combustor in which a
mixture of fuel and the compressed air is burned to
generate a propulsive gas flow, and a high pressure
turbine which is rotated by the propulsive gas flow and
which is connected by a larger diameter shaft to drive
the high pressure compressor. A typical aircraft
bypass turbofan engine adds a low pressure turbine
(located aft of the high pressure turbine) which is
connected by a smaller diameter coaxial shaft to drive
a front fan (located forward of the high pressure
compressor) which is surrounded by a fan nacelle and
which may also drive a low pressure compressor (located
between the front fan and the high pressure
compressor). The low pressure compressor sometimes is
called a booster compressor or simply a booster. A
flow splitter, located between the fan and the first
(usually the low pressure) compressor, separates the 
air which exits the fan into a core engine airflow and
a surrounding bypass airflow. The bypass airflow from
the fan exits the fan nozzle (also called the fan
bypass nozzle or the fan exhaust nozzle) to provide
most of the engine thrust (for the case of a high
bypass engine) for the aircraft. Some of
the engine thrust comes from the core engine airflow
after it flows through the low and high pressure
compressors to the combustor and is expanded through
the high and low pressure turbines and accelerated out
of the core nozzle (also called the core exhaust
nozzle). A core nacelle surrounds the low and high
pressure compressors and turbines and the intervening
combustor.Known aircraft bypass turbofan engine designs
include those having a row of variable-pitch (e.g.,
pivoting) fan outlet guide vanes radially located
between the fan and core nacelles and longitudinally
located aft of the flow splitter wherein it has been
reported that the vane incidence angle is controlled to
reduce losses, improve fan bypass efficiency and
increase fan bypass stall margin. One system for
controlling variable pitch outlet guide vanes has been
described in our prior patent specification GB-A-2038421.
What is needed is a method to more
efficiently operate such an engine.The invention seeks to provide a method of
operating an

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating an aircraft bypass
turbofan engine (10), said engine (10) including: a

generally longitudinally extending axis (12) extending
forward and aft; a longitudinally aft-most row of

generally radially outwardly extending fan rotor blades
(30); a core nacelle (32) disposed longitudinally aft

of said blades (30) and having a longitudinally forward
end defining a flow splitter (34); a fan nacelle (38)

circumferentially surrounding said blades (30) and at
least a portion of said core nacelle (32); and a row of

variable-pitch fan outlet guide vanes (52) radially
disposed between said fan and core nacelles (38 and 32)

and longitudinally disposed aft of said flow splitter
(34), and said method comprising the steps of:


(a) repeatedly measuring fan rotor speed;
(b) adjusting the pitch of said vanes (52) to a
preselected value as a function of the current fan

rotor speed measurement to generally minimize engine
noise during a noise reduction mode of engine

operation,
(c) adjusting the pitch of said vanes (52) to a
preestablished value as a function of the current fan

rotor speed measurement during a mode of engine
operation different from said noise reduction mode,

wherein said preselected value is different from said
preestablished value for an identical fan rotor speed

measurement, and
(d) sensing an engine out condition for said
engine (10) and adjusting the pitch of said vanes (52)

to a predetermined value as a function of the current
fan rotor speed measurement to generally maximize

airflow through said vanes (52) during an engine out
condition.
