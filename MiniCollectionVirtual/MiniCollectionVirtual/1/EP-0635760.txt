<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of microstructure elements having structure depths of from several  mu m into the mm region by imagewise irradiation of polymers applied to dimensionally stable supports by means of one or more adhesive layers, with synchrotron radiation and removal of the areas which have been exposed imagewise, where the adhesive layer comprises carbon or carbon compounds with elements of low atomic number and is applied to the dimensionally stable support by vapour deposition, plasma supported chemical gas-phase deposition or cathode sputtering.   The process is suitable for the production of microstructure elements from metals or plastic.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of microstructure 
elements having structure depths of from several µm into 

the mm range by imagewise irradiation of polymers applied 

to dimensionally stable substrates by means of one or 
more adhesion layers, with synchrotron radiation and 

removal of the areas which have been irradiated imagewise, 
wherein the uppermost adhesion layer in contact 

with the polymer comprises pure carbon or hydrocarbons 
having a substoichiometric content of hydrogen, this 

adhesion layer being applied to the dimensionally stable 
substrate by vapor deposition, cathode sputtering or 

plasma-supported chemical gas-phase deposition. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
thickness of the uppermost adhesion layer is from 10⁻³ to 

10 µm. 
A process as claimed in either of the preceding 
claims, wherein the dimensionally stable substrate is 

electroconductive. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
dimensionally stable substrate has semiconductor properties. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
dimensionally stable substrate is an insulator. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
dimensionally stable substrate is a silicon wafer. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein microstructure elements having structure 

depths of from 3 to 2000 µm and lateral dimensions of 
less than 10 µm are produced from an X-ray sensitive 

polymer.  
 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the electroforming and casting steps 

conventional in the LIGA process are subsequently carried 
out, and microstructure elements are produced from metals 

or plastics.
