<DESCRIPTION>
 UL InZ FϋNGICIDAL OXAZOLIDINONES * FIELD OF THE INVENTION i 5 The present invention relates to substituted 6 oxazolidinone compounds, fungicidal compositions containing such compounds, and method of use of the compounds and compositions as fungicides. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 10 New compounds effective for controlling the growth of undesired fungi are in constant demand. In the most common situation, such compounds are sought to selectively control the growth of fungi in useful crops such as cotton, rice, corn, wheat and soybeans, to name 15 a few. Unchecked fungus growth in such crops can cause significant losses, reducing profit to the farmer and increasing costs to the consumer. There are many products commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for products which are more 20 effective, less costly and environmentally safe.WO90/12791 teaches the use of fungicidal compounds of Formula i25 i wherein:A is 0 or NR4; and W is 0 or S. ■. WO90/12791 also relates to processes for the 30 preparation of these compounds and to certain novel compounds. The compounds of O90/12791 differ from those of the present invention in the nature of R2. 

The above reference does not disclose the compounds of the present invention.The compounds of the prior art, although useful as fungicides, tend to have drawbacks including poor efficacy, toxicity to non-target organisms and/or unacceptable environmental effects. A need therefore exists for fungicidal products and methods of application which address the limitations of the prior art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention comprises compounds of Formula I including all geometric and stereoisomers, agricultural compositions containing them and use of the compounds and compositions as fungicides. The variation in Formula I occurs primarily in substituent R2. Formula I comprises:wherein:R1 is H; C-.-C4 alkyl; C^^ haloalkyl; C3-C6 cycloalkyl; C2-C alkenyl; C2-C4 alkoxycarbonyl; or phenylmethyl optionally substituted on the phenyl ring with R6 and on the benzylic carbon with R7;R2 is C7-C20 alkyl; C7-C2o haloalkyl; C4-C17 alkyl substituted with C3-C6 cycloalkyl; C4-C17 alkyl substituted with phenyl optionally substituted with R31 on the phenyl ring; C3-C14 alkyl substituted with phenoxy or phenylthio each optionally substituted with R31; C1-C o alkyl substituted with R19; C2-C6 alkoxyalkyl 

 substituted with R21; C7-C2o alkoxyalkyl optionally substituted with R21; C7-C20 alkenyl;C2-C20 alkenyl substituted with R20; C7-C20 alkynyl; C2-C20 alkynyl
