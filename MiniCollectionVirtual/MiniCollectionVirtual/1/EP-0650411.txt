<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an installation for the thermal drying of strips, sheets, etc., which are conveyed along a path (12) over guide elements (15) past the drier units (14) of a drying device (13). The installation has a refrigeration device (16, 17, 18, 19) whose coolant is fed through suitable coolant lines (20) to the guide elements (15) in the drying zone and to the drier units (14), from where it is fed to a heat exchanger (16). The installation also has an air extractor (23) to extract the air from the drying zone. In order to give a space-saving installation, the invention proposes that the heat exchanger (26) in the refrigeration device is located in the vicinity of the air-extraction aperture (36) of the air extractor, adjacent to the drying zone.

Installation for the thermal drying of strips, sheets, etc., which are 
conveyed along a path (12) over guide elements (15) past the dryer 

units (14) of a drying device (13), having 

a refrigerator device (16, 17, 18, 19) whose coolant is fed 
through suitable coolant lines (20) to the guide elements (15) 

in the drying zone and to drier units (14), from where it is fed 
to a heat exchanger (16), and 
an air extractor (23) to extract the air from the drying zone, 
characterized in that
 
the heat exchanger (16) in the refrigeration device is located in the 

vicinity of the air extraction aperture (36) of the air extractor, 
adjacent to the drying zone. 
Installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the air 
extractor (23) is arranged in an accessory housing (32) attached to a 

machine housing (33) that encloses the conveying path (12) and the 
drying elements (14). 
Installation according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the heat 
exchanger (16) of the refrigeration device is arranged in the 

accessory housing (32).  
 
Installation according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the refrigeration device comprises a coolant circulation system 

including a circulation pump (19), which is arranged in the accessory 
housing (32) together with the other operating and control means 

(18, 17) of the refrigeration device for the coolant circulation 
system. 
Installation according to claim 4, characterised in that detachable line 

connectors (45, 47), located in the transition area between the 
accessory housing (32) and the machine housing (33), are provided 

in the coolant lines (46, 20 and/or 22) leading away from and back 
to the heat exchanger (16). 
Installation according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that a flow 
detector (17), located in the accessory housing (32), is arranged in 

the coolant circulation system between the heat exchanger (16) and 
the circulation pump (19). 
Installation according to claims 4 to 6, characterised in that a 
coolant equalising reservoir (18) located in the accessory housing 

(32) is provided in the coolant circulation system between the heat 
exchanger (16) and the circulation pump (19). 
Installation according to any of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the air extractor comprises a connection housing, in which 

the heat exchanger (16) is located in the vicinity of the air intake 
zone (36) and to which a blower (25) is connected by its intake end.  

 
Installation according to claim 8, characterised in that the connection 
housing (26) comprises a preferably rectangular air extraction zone 

(35, 36) extending substantially across the entire width of the 
conveying path and being substantially covered by the heat 

exchanger (16). 
Installation according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in that, viewed 
in crosswise direction to the conveying path (12), the blower (25) is
