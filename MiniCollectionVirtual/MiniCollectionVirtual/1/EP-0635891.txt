<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor integrated circuit device that can prevent 
a crack in a silicon nitride acting as a dielectric thin film 

of a capacitance element. 
A lower electrode of a gate polycrystalline silicon is 
formed on a LOCOS oxide film. A BPSG film is formed as an 

interlayer insulating film. An opening as well as first and 
second contact holes surrounding the opening are formed. A 

silicon nitride film is deposited on the opening and then an 
upper electrode is formed on the silicon nitride film. A 

take-out electrode extending out of the first contact hole is 
in contact with the lower electrode. The first and second 

contact holes separate the BPSG film into a first portion 
surrounding the silicon nitride film and a second portion 

outside the first portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
integrated circuit device which has at least a capacitance
element comprising a high dielectric thin film sandwiched with
electrode materials and can prevent cracking in the high
dielectric thin film.A junction-type capacitor, a MOS-type capacitor, a
MIS-type capacitor, and the like are listed as a capacitance
element integrated into semiconductor integrated circuit
device. The junction-type capacitor uses a PN-junction
capacitance. The MOS-type capacitor uses a silicon oxide film
sandwiched between a diffusion region (or lower electrode) and
an upper metal electrode. The MIS-type capacitor uses a
silicon nitride film having higher dielectric constant instead
of the silicon oxide film. Without using the diffusion region,
both the upper and lower electrodes can be made of an electrode
wiring material for sandwiching the dielectric thin film. This
structure can cancel a voltage dependency of a capacitance
value because it has no variation in resistance.Figs. 7A and 7B show a conventional structure of the
capacitance element. Fig. 7A is a plan view showing a
structure of the capacitance element described above. Fig. 7B
is a cross sectional view taken along line F-F in Fig. 7A. 
Referring to Figs. 7A and 7B, a lower electrode 2 of a
polycrystalline silicon film is formed on a LOCOS (local
oxidation) oxide film 1 formed on a semiconductor substrate.
A silicon nitride film 5 is deposited so as to cover the
opening 4 in the interlayer insulating film 3. An upper
electrode 6 is formed on the silicon nitride film 5 using a
part of an aluminum wiring electrode 6. An aluminum take-out
electrode 8 is electrically in contact with the lower electrode
2 via a contact hole 7 in the interlayer insulating film 3.
The capacitance element having the above mentioned structure is
disclosed, for example, in Japanese laid-open Patent
Publication 2-226755.For the latest semiconductor integrated circuit devices,
a smoothing technique is indispensably adopted for smoothing
steps formed on a surface to establish high density electrode
wiring. A reflowing process of an interlayer insulating film
is one of the most typical smoothing techniques. Boron-phosphosilicate
glass (BPSG) has been widely used as a
reflowing material. In this technique, a BPSG film is heated,
and then thermally softened to absorb the underlying steps so
that the shape of an opening is smoothed. In order to
integrate a capacitance element using the reflowing technique,
a silicon nitride film 5 is deposited onto
