<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises the transverse transition portion 
(8) and a sheetlike buttstrap (11, 11a). The transverse portion 

(8) is capable of being flush with a transverse end 
edge (2a) of the lid section (2) and engages the side walls 

(4) of the base section (1) by way of end walls (10) which 
may be provided with projections (20) or with hook-shaped 

legs (22). The transverse portion (8) is provided with center 
tabs (9) extending longitudinally and which are capable of 

being covered by the lid section (2). It is also provided 
with retaining holes (14). The sheetlike buttstrap (11, 11a) 

is adapted to cover the transverse portion (8) and the part 
of the lid section (2) covering the center tab (9). It is 

provided with resilient protuberances (13) mating with the 
retaining holes (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for joining trays for 
electrical conduits, particularly for joining a first length 
of tray to a second length of tray or to an accessory, said 
trays being formed by a base section and by a lid section, 
the base section having a bottom wall and side walls in which 
there are longitudinal grooves forming a rear plane and the 
lid section being provided with inwardly directed lips capable 
of being retentively inserted in said longitudinal 
grooves, said lengths of tray forming transverse end edges 
of the base section and of the lid section; the device being 
provided with a transitional transverse portion adapted to be 
flush with a transverse end edge of said lid section and 
having: means for engagement with said side walls; at least 
one center tab extending longitudinally from said transverse 
portion and being adapted to be covered by said lid section. The said trays are made according to set lengths which 
frequently do not coincide with the lengths used in the 
field. Therefore, successive connections or joints which are 
clearly visible although the facing transverse edges are in 
mating abutment have to be made. Also, when the trays have to 
be expressly cut for inserting electrical mechanism boxes or 
to form elbows, branches or terminations, it is not always 
possible to make such cuts with the required accuracy whereby, 
since the joint is visible, it spoils the accuracy and 
pulchritude of the installation. Another point to bear in mind is that the presence of 
joints more or less accurately made between trays forms narrow 
gaps allowing moisture, dust and other foreign bodies to 
penetrate. US-A-4 077 434 shows a sealed lay-in electrical conduit 
duct of the type cited above; notwithstanding the invention 
object of this document does not provide a great security to 
avoid the appearance of the narrow gaps mentioned in the 
above paragraph. It is an object of the invention to adopt solutions 
which, further to overcoming the above drawbacks, provide a 
better finish to the installation. This object is achieved  
 
according to the invention by a device of the type mentioned 
at the beginning which is characterized in that said transitional 
transverse portion comprises at least one retaining 
hole; and in that said device comprises a sheetlike buttstrap, 
adapted to cover said transitional transverse portion 
and at least part of the lid section adapted to cover said 
center tab and having at least one resilient protuberance to 
be inserted retentively

A device for joining trays for electrical conduits, 
particularly for joining a first length of tray to a second 

length of tray or to an accessory, said trays being formed by 
a base section (1) and by a lid section (2), the base section 

having a bottom wall (3) and side walls (4) in which there 
are longitudinal grooves (5) forming a rear plane and the lid 

section (2) being provided with inwardly directed lips (6) 
capable of being retentively inserted in said longitudinal 

grooves (5), said lengths of tray forming transverse end 
edges (1a, 2a) of the base section (1) and of the lid section 

(2); the device being provided with a transitional transverse 
portion (8) adapted to be flush with a transverse end edge 

(2a) of said lid section (2) and having: means (10, 22) for 
engagement with said side walls (4); at least one center tab 

(9) extending longitudinally from said transverse portion and 
being adapted to be covered by said lid section (2), characterized 

in that said transitional transverse portion (8) 
comprises at least one retaining hole (14); and in that said 

device comprises a sheetlike buttstrap (11, 11a), adapted to 
cover said transitional transverse portion (8) and at least 

part of the lid section (2) adapted to cover said center tab 
(9) and having at least one resilient protuberance (13) to be 

inserted retentively in said retaining hole (14). 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that said 
engagement means are two end walls (10) of said transverse 

portion (8), capable of externally abutting said side walls 
(4) of said base section (1). 
The device of claim 2, characterized in that said 
end walls (10) are provided with internally extending projections 

(20) and which are capable of being retentively 
inserted in said longitudinal grooves (5). 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that said 
transverse portion (8) has two hook-shaped legs (22) capable 

of retentively engaging said rear plane of said groove (5) in 
the side walls (4) of the base section (1). 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that said 
resilient protuberance (13) of said sheetlike buttstrap (11, 

11a) is provided with a peripheral retaining bead (16).  
 
The device of claim 5, characterized in that said 
resilient protuberance (13) is tubular and is divided by at 

least one axial cut (17). 
The device of claim 6, characterized in that said 
sheetlike buttstrap (11, 11a) is provided with at least one 

projecting flat tab (19) generally centered on one of said 
resilient protuberances (13) and said transverse portion (8) 

has at least one elongated hole (21) capable of receiving one 
of said tabs (19). 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that said 
transverse portion (8) and said sheetlike buttstrap (11) are
