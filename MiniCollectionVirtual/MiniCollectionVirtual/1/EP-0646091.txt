<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to folder gluer machines for making
paper cartons from a traveling carton blank, and more particularly to a
support tool for temporarily supporting the top surface of the carton
blank during a folding operation.When making paper cartons, a traveling carton blank
which has previously been cut to the appropriate shape and scored to
define a main carton portion and at least one flap, is sent to a folder
gluer machine for folding the flap to form a side wall of the carton and
to glue the side walls together. Such paper cartons are typically
employed in retail stores for boxing clothing or other similar items
where a rigid carton is not required. In the folder gluer machine, a
folding hook is typically employed to rotate and engage the bottom
surface of the carton flap to bend the flap along the score line and form
the side wall of the carton. The carton blank is typically traveling in a
direction perpendicular to the score line so that the folding hook must
be operated in timed relation to the speed of the traveling blank.One problem that has developed in folder gluer machines is that
occasionally a carton flap will buckle or kink when the folding hook
engages its bottom surface. This results in improper carton formation
and subsequent jamming of the blank in the folder gluer machine. The
machine must then be stopped and cleared of the jam resulting in
undesirable down time for the entire carton making operation. It has
been found that this buckling or kinking occurs especially when
employing recycled paperboard for the carton blank since recycled
paperboard has little fibre or grain structure to provide "body" for the
blank.A typical, but complex, box making machine arranged to fold
flaps of a pre-cut carton blank is shown in US-2 291 063, which discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1. This
machine has a movable support arranged temporarily to support the
top surface of the blank during a pre-folding operation performed on a 
flap of the blank, though the machine does not use a folding hook as
described herein. A disadvantage of this arrangement, apart from its
complexity, is that a blank must be stationary during the pre-folding
operation.Apparatus for making paper cartons from a traveling blank
according to this invention is defined in appended claim 1. A carton
blank support member is mounted above a traveling carton blank in a
folder gluer machine. The support member is cyclically driven between
an inoperative position above the carton blank to an operative

<CLAIMS>
Folder gluer apparatus for making paper cartons from a
traveling carton blank (2) having a supported bottom surface (4) and an

unsupported top surface (3), said carton blank (2) having a score line (6)
formed therein defining a carton flap (8), and folding means (10, 11) for

folding said flap (8) upwardly along said score line (6) toward said top
surface (3) to form a side wall of a carton, a carton blank support

apparatus for temporarily supporting the top surface (3) of said carton
blank (2) during a folding operation, said carton blank support

apparatus being characterised in that there is provided:

a stationary housing (14) supported above said traveling carton
blank (2);
a first link (22) having an elongate body with upper and lower
opposite ends (23,24) said first link (22) mounted for longitudinal

movement within said housing so that said lower end (24) moves in a
rectilinear motion;
a second link (34) having an elongate body with inner and outer
opposite ends (35,36), said second link (34) mounted for longitudinal

movement within said housing (14) and slidably interconnected
intermediate its inner and outer ends (35,36) with the lower end (24) of

said first link (22) for movement therewith so that the outer end (36) of
said second link (34) moves from a first position above said carton

blank (2) to a second position above said carton blank and closer to said
carton blank than said first position;
drive means (30, 33; 39, 40; 43) connected to the upper end (23)
of said first link (22) and the inner end (35) of said second link (34) for

independently driving said first and second links (22, 34) in their
respective longitudinal movements; and
a carton blank support member (47) connected to the outer end
(36) of said second link (34) for movement therewith from an inoperative

position above said carton blank when said outer end (36) is in its first
position to an operative position engaging the top surface (3) of said 

carton blank adjacent said score line (6) during a folding operation
when said outer end (36) is in its second position.
Folder gluer apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
movement of the outer end (36) of said second link (34) is such that

when engaging the top surface (3) of said carton blank said support
member (47) is traveling a the same rate of speed as said carton blank.
Folder gluer apparatus as claimed in claim 1, or claim 2,
wherein said drive means comprises a first gear (30) mounted for

rotation in a first direction (32) within said housing (14) about a first
axis (31), first connecting means (33) for connecting the upper end (23)

of said first link (22) to said first gear (30) for rotation therewith, a
second gear (39) mounted for rotation within said housing (14) about a

second axis (41) parallel to said first axis (31) in the same direction (42)
as said first gear, second connecting means (40) for connecting the

inner end (35) of said second link (34) to said second gear (39) for
rotation therewith, and means (43) for rotating said first and second

gears (30,39) in said first directions (32, 42).
Folder gluer apparatus as claimed in claim 3, wherein said
means for rotating said first and second gears (30, 39) comprises a drive

gear (43) mounted for rotation within said housing (14) about a third
axis (44) parallel to said first and second axes (31,39) and in the

opposite direction (45) as said first and second gears.
Folding gluer apparatus as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4,
wherein said first and second connection means each comprises a

crank pin (33, 40).
Folder gluer apparatus as claimed in any of the preceding
claims, wherein the lower end (24) of said first link is bifurcated to form

a pair of spaced arms (25, 26) and said second link (34) passes between
said spaced arms.
Folder gluer apparatus as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
rectilinear motion of the lower end (24) of said first link (22) is provided

by a vertically extending race (20, 21) formed in said housing (14) and a 
bearing (27, 28) mounted outside of one of said arms (25, 26), said

bearing (27, 28) captured within said race for rolling movement therein.
Folder gluer apparatus as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7,
wherein said second link (34) includes an elongate opening (38) formed

therein intermediate its inner and outer ends (35, 36) and the
