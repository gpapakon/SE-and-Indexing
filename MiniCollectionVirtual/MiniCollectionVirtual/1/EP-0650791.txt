<ABSTRACT>
A fine-grained powder is composed of metal, metal alloy, or a metallic cpd., MeX, where Me=Al, Ga, In, Te, Ge, Sn, Pb, As, Sb, Ag, Au, Pt and/or Pd, and X=C, N, B, Si, Se, Te, P, O and S or their combinations, with the exception of AlN and Al2O3. Particle size is 1.0-1000 nm, with less than 1% of particles deviating by more than 40% from mean particle size, and none of the particles deviating by more than 60% from mean particle size.
