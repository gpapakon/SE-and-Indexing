<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a low-pressure mercury vapour 
discharge lamp comprising two or more substantially parallel 

co-extending glass discharge tubes wherein an inter-connecting 
joint is formed between the tubes by heating the tubes to form 

blisters and causing the blisters to simultaneously fuse and 
break, thereby forming a joint between the tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of producing a low-pressure
mercury vapour discharge lamp.More particularly, the invention relates to a method of
producing a low-pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp
comprising two or more substantially parallel co-extending
glass discharge tubes, the discharge spaces of two adjacent
discharge tubes being inter-connected by a coupling tube
extending transverse to the axes of the discharge tubes, such
that during operation of the lamp, the discharge passes
predominantly through the discharge tube, and in which method
the discharge tubes are first coated on the inside with a
luminescent layer and then closed at one end. Such a method
is disclosed in German patent specification 858,105.German patent specification 858,105 describes a method
in which the above-mentioned lamps are produced by providing
an aperture in the glass wall of the discharge tube prior to
deposition of a luminescent layer, the connecting coupling
tubes being sealed thereto after the application of the
luminescent layer.UK patent specification GB 2 048 562B recognises that
this method has the drawback that during the process of
coating the discharge tube wall with luminescent material,
which is often done by means of a suspension, liquid material
can easily flow out through the aperture so that it is
difficult to realise a uniform coating on the wall. There is
also the risk that fusion of the coupling tube to the
discharge tube is made difficult by enclosure of luminescent
material in the glass seal. This may cause stresses in the
glass and the chance of fracture is considerable.In an attempt to overcome these drawbacks, the above
mentioned UK patent specification proposes that such lamps are 
produced by a method in which the inner wall of the discharge
tube is first coated with a luminescent layer and then sealed
at one end. Once a luminescent layer has been deposited on
the inner wall, the tube is heated to form an aperture. The
aperture is formed with an outwardly facing collar. This
process is repeated with a second discharge tube and the tubes
are then placed with their apertures opposite one another.
The collars are then fused together by further heating to form
a coupling tube.Such a method has the drawback -that exhaust gas,
particles and even oil contained in the fuel supply piping
will be unavoidably introduced into the gas discharge tube
from the apertures.In addition, when the collars are heated with a naked
flame and fused to form the coupling tube, the luminescent
material becomes

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a low-pressure mercury vapour
discharge lamp comprising two or more substantially parallel

co-extending glass discharge tubes (2,4), the discharge spaces of
two adjacent discharge tubes being inter-connected by an

inter-connecting joint (22) extending transversely to the wall of
those discharge tubes, during operation of the lamp the

discharge passing through the greater part of the discharge
tubes, in which method the inner walls of the discharge tubes

are:

(a) first coated with a luminescent layer (6) and sealed at
one end (8); and
(b) placing the discharge tubes adjacent to each other
and heating at points opposite to one another so that blisters (18,20)

are formed naturally on the walls of the discharge tubes;

characterised by the steps of

(c) applying regulated pressurised gas to enlarge each
of the blisters;
(d) heating the blisters and moving the discharge tubes
close to each other so as to join the blisters together;
(e) applying regulated pressurised gas from one or more
directions to result in simultaneous breakage of the blisters

and the formation of the joint ; and
(f) pulling the discharge tubes to a pre-determined
distance to form the inter-connecting joint between the discharge tubes.
