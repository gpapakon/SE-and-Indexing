<ABSTRACT>
A container for air transport and aimed dropping, for which the container (1) is connected to a braking system (3, 4, 6) allows accurately aimed dropping in that it is provided with a controller which has a navigation system and operating means for a passive guidance device (4, 6) which can result in the container (1) making lateral direction changes during the braked descent. The container is preferably provided on its underneath with a large-volume shock absorber (7 to 10) which, at most, has a slightly raised pressure.

Container for air transport and for targeted dropping, 
for which latter purpose the container (1) is provided 

with a braking system and with a steering arrangement 
in the form of flaps (4, 6) which can be put down 

laterally from the container, 
characterised in that
 
the flaps (4, 6) project away from the container walls 

via surfaces which are of a size such that they form 
the braking system for the container (1), and 
in that
 
the container (1) is provided with a control system 

which has a navigation system and actuating means for 
the angular position of the flaps (4, 6) for the 

purpose of accurately targeted correction of the 
direction of falling by lateral changes in direction 

during the braked fall of the container (1) in 
dependence upon the output signals of the navigation 

system. 
Container according to claim 1, characterised in that 
it is provided, on its underside, with a large-volume 

shock-absorber (7 to 10) which is under, at most, a 
slight excess pressure. 
Container according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the shock-absorber is formed by a downwardly open 

tarpaulin (9) devoid of excess pressure, which is held 
in a downwardly open, convexly curved shape by an 

inflatable supporting structure (7, 8). 
Container according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the tarpaulin (9) is provided, preferably in its upper 

region, with air outlet holes (10). 
Container according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in 

that the inflatable supporting structure (7, 8) is 
inflated at an excess pressure which is so slight that 

the said structure collapses rapidly when the 
container strikes the ground.  

 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by a parachute (3) which is fastened to 

the said container and is so dimensioned that it 
brings about the rapid orientation of the container 

(1) into a stable falling position and, if need be, 
represents an additional braking system. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the flaps (4, 6) are essentially 

operative in the upper half of the container (1) or 
above the said container (1). 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the flaps (4, 6) are of multi-part 

construction on all four sides of the container 
(1). 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the flaps (4, 6) are provided 

with arrangements which render the airflow turbulent. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the flaps (4, 6) are formed by 

stable, adjustable frame parts over which a flexible 
fabric is stretched. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the intervening spaces between 

the flaps (4, 6) are spanned by a flexible fabric 
(11). 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the navigation system is a 

global positioning system equipment. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the actuating means act upon the  

 
steering arrangement hydraulically, pneumatically or 

electrically. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that all the parts are fastened to 

it. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that it can be folded together and, 

in the folded-together condition, all the parts 
fastened to it are adjacent to it. 
Container according to one of claims 1 to 15, 
characterised by visual and/or acoustic signalling 

arrangements which are fastened to it.
