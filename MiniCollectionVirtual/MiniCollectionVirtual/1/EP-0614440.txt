<ABSTRACT>
Self-supporting, closed box body superstructures or containers composed of individual walls made of an insulating, sandwich material, with no thermal bridges, with or without cooling units, for the transport of goods on trucks, are known. The individual prefabricated walls are glued together at their corners with inner and outer angles that increase their stability. A self-supporting, closed container made of fiber-reinforced plastics as an insulating, sandwich construction with no thermal bridges is made of a single piece. Its bottom, top and walls (2) are not individually prefabricated. The type of the supporting fibres, their number and their orientation are graded in the whole sandwich structure according to stress conditions. The container is automotive when provided with corresponding units, with or without cooling units.

A container for transporting merchandise, appliances, 
persons and animals, comprising a container housing 

(1) having main openings (3) which may be closed 
and which are situated at face sides of the container 

housing, wherein an interior space of the container 
housing may be accessed through said main openings, and 

the housing (1) has a fibrous sandwich structure which 
comprises at least a first and a second fiber layer 

(12,14) which are separated from each other by a support 
layer (13) maintaining a spacing, 
characterized in 
that
 the container housing (1) consists exclusively of 
a self-supporting, one-piece fibrous sandwich shell 

with fibrous sandwich structure using a fiber-reinforced 
plastic material, without forming joints and with 

large-surface load-carrying ability, and that the fibers 
in the respective fiber layer are applied in two 

distribution directions, the one of which extends in 
the direction of load application and the other extends 

perpendicular thereto.  
 
A container according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 corner elements (5) are provided on outer corners 
of the container. 
A container according to claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
 holding devices and/or receptacle devices are provided 
on the container. 
A container according to claim 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the corner elements (5) and the holding devices 
are constructed in one piece with the container housing 

(1). 
A container according to claim 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the corner elements (5) and the holding devices 
are attached to the container housing as auxiliary elements. 
A container according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 at least one door (4) is provided for closing the 
main openings (3). 
A container according to claim 6, 
characterized in 
that
 a locking mechanism is fitted inside the fibrous 
sandwich structure of the door (4). 
A container according to claim 6, 
characterized in 
that
 seals (7) are provided between the at least one 
door (4) and the container housing (1). 
A container according to anyone of the previous 
claims, 
characterized in that
 at least one closable auxiliary 
opening is provided.  

 
A container according to claim 9, 
characterized in 
that
 at least one closure device for closing the auxiliary 
opening. 
A container according to claim 10, 
characterized in 
that
 a seal is provided between the closure device and 
the container housing (1). 
A container according to anyone of the previous 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the fiber layers (12,14) 
are provided with covering layers (11,15), wherein an 

inner one of said covering layers (15) is inert with 
respect to the merchandise being transported. 
A container according to anyone of the previous 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the space maintaining 
support layer (13) has heat insulating properties. 
A container according to anyone of the previous 
claims, 
characterized in that
 the support layer (13) 
is bonded two-dimensionally to the first fiber layer 

(12) and the second fiber layer (14). 
A container according to anyone of the previous 
claims, 
characterized by
 apparatus incorporated into 
the fibrous sandwich structure to provide environmental 

conditions required for the merchandise being transported. 
A container according to anyone of the claims 3 to 
15, 
characterized in that
 the one of the receptacles is 
provided for placing an apparatus for controlling atmosphere 

inside the container actively or passively.
