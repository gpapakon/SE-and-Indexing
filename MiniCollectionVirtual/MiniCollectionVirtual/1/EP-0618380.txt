<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
having a pendulum structure such as cable
suspension transporter (gondola lift).In recent years, cable suspension transporters
used in skiing grounds or sightseeing places have been
under discussion for adoption as traffic means, by virtue
of their low construction cost as compared with monorail
and the like. However, the largest disadvantage of those
cable suspension transporters is their weakness to wind.
Transporters suspended to steel cables are easily affected
by drag of wind in terms of structure. Accordingly, they
are currently stopped in operation at a wind velocity of
approximately 15 m/s, but need to be operable for at least
a wind velocity around 20 m/s to use them as a mean of city
traffic. Thus, the technique for damping wind-excited
vibration of cable suspension transporters gains
considerable public attentions. However, general
translational motion models cannot be applied to this
technique, which necessitates a new technique for damping
vibrations of rigid pendulums.As concrete damping techniques for cable 
suspension transporters, there have conventionally been
proposed one using gyroscopic moment(Nishihara, Matsuhisa,
and Sato, Vibration Damping Mechanism with Gyroscopic
Moment, Transactions of JSME, C, 57-534(1991), 497;
Matsuoka and Nishida, Control the Rolling Motion of a
Ropeway Gondola by a Gyro Device, Proceedings of
JSME, No. 920-55, B (1992), 178). As for these, a trial
product for six-passenger transporter has already been
manufactured (Kanki H., Nekomoto Y. and Monobe H.,
Development of CMG Active Vibration Control Device for
Gondola, The First International Conference on Motion and
Vibration Control (MOVIC), (1992), 310), in which swing
caused by wind is reduced to about 1/3. However, this has
a problem that since the cable suspension transporter is
not connected to external power supply, there arises a need
of developing a power-saving system which can be driven by
batteries.Further, there have been proposed another damping
technique using dynamic absorber on which there have been
discussed spring-mass type absorber or pendulum type
absorber (Sato and Chishima, Swing Reduction of
Gondola Lift Carriers by Pendulum-Type Dynamic Absorber,
Proceedings of JSME, C, No. 910-17(1991), 528 and 529). This discloses an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 and it shows more particular a pendulum dynamic absorber mounted on the suspended body of the pendulum structure being damped, with the damping mass swinging below the suspended
