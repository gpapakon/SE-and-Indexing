Thread clamping device for holding at least one thread 
in a textile machine, including means (11, 12) for 

inserting or feeding the thread (29, 30) into the thread 
clamping device and means (15) for detaching the clamped 

thread (29, 30), characterised by a clamping-tape device 
(1) including a clamping tape (7, 8) which clamps the 

thread (29, 30), the tape-run of the tape being 
controllable and the tape holding the thread that is to 

be clamped between itself and a rigid surface. 
Thread clamping device for holding at least one thread 
in a textile machine, including means (11, 12) for 

inserting or feeding the thread (29, 30) into the thread 
clamping device and means (15) for detaching the clamped 

thread, characterised by a clamping-tape device (1) that 
comprises two clamping tapes (7, 8) whose tape-runs are 

controllable and which tapes press against one another in 
the thread clamping region and can be moved such that 

their tape-runs are in the same direction. 
Thread clamping device in accordance with Claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that, the tape-run of at least one of 

the clamping tapes (7, 8) is controllable by means of a 
stepping motor. 
Thread clamping device in accordance with any of the 
preceding Claims, characterised by a movable thread 

feeding hook (11, 12) for feeding the thread that is to 
be clamped (29, 30) into the clamping region of the 

clamping-tape device (1). 
Thread clamping device in accordance with Claim 4, 
characterised by a thread feeding hook (11, 12) on each 

of the longitudinal sides of the clamping-tape device 
(1).  

 
Thread clamping device in accordance with Claim 4 or 
5, characterised in that, the thread feeding hook or the 

thread feeding hooks (11, 12) can be moved in a 
controlled manner by means of at least one stepping 

motor. 
Thread clamping device in accordance with any of the 
preceding Claims, characterised by at least one thread 

guiding element (18) for guiding a thread that has been 
led out from the clamping region of the clamping tape 

device (1). 
Thread clamping device in accordance with Claim 7, 
characterised in that, at least one thread guiding 

element (18) is fixed in position. 
Thread clamping device in accordance with Claim 7, 
characterised in that, at least one thread guiding 

element (18) is movable. 
Thread clamping device in accordance with any of the 
Claims 7 to 9, characterised in that, at least one thread 

feeding hook (11, 12) is constructed such as to be able 
to grip the guided thread. 
Thread clamping device in accordance with any of the 

preceding Claims, characterised by a thread cutting 
device (15) for detaching the clamped thread (29, 30). 
The use of the thread clamping device and the thread 
cutting device in accordance with any of the preceding 

Claims 1 to 11 in a flat-bed knitting machine (2) having 
needle beds (3, 4). 
Flat-bed knitting machine including a thread clamping 
device and a detaching device in accordance with any of  

 
the Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that, the clamping-tape 

device (1) is arranged on at least one side of the 
flat-bed knitting machine (2) at the sideways end of the 

needle beds (3, 4) and its clamping region extending 
substantially parallel to the device for drawing off the 

knitted fabric. 
Flat-bed knitting machine in accordance with Claim 
13, characterised in that, the clamping-tape device 1 is 

arranged below a plane defined by the knitting area. 
Flat-bed knitting machine in accordance with any of 
the Claims 13 to 14, characterised in that, the cutting 

device 15 is arranged between the clamping-tape device 
(1) and the needle beds (3, 4).
