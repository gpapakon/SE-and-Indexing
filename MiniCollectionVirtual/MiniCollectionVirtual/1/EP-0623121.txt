<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of derivatives of
N-acetyl neuraminic acid. More particularly the invention relates to a process for the
preparation of 5-acetamido-4-amino-2,3,4,5-tetradeoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-enopyranosonic
acid (the 4-amino analogue of DANA; also known as 5-(acetylamino)-4-amino-2,6-anhydro-3,4,5-trideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-enonic
acid) and derivatives thereof and the preparation of intermediates for use in the process.Schreiner et. al. Ann. Chem 1991, 129-134 describe the preparation of the 4-amino
analogue of DANA from the peracetylated methyl ester of sialic acid (peracetyl NANA
methyl ester) by the route shown in Scheme 1.PCT/AU91/00161 (publication no. WO91/16320) describes a number of derivatives
of 5-acetamido 2,3,5-trideoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-enopyranosonic acid
(2,3-dideoxy-2,3-didehydro-N- acetyl-neuraminic acid; DANA) including the 4-amino
analogue of DANA from the peracetylated methyl ester of DANA by a method similar to
that of Schreiner et. al. with the exception that the peracetylated compound (3a) was
reduced prior to deacetylation. The method is shown in Scheme 2.A major problem with the known processes for preparing the 4-amino analogue of
DANA lies in the fact that the conversion directly or indirectly of the compound (2) and
any other compound with a leaving group in the 4-position with azide is not stereospecific
and leads to significant amounts of the undesired β-isomer (3b) in addition to the desired
α-isomer (3a). This leads to both reduced yields of the desired compound and to the
need for chromatographic purification at this or a subsequent step in the synthesis.We have now found that by careful selection of the azide source the conversion of
(2) to (3a) can be effected with high stereospecificity.The invention thus provides in a first aspect a method for the preparation of the
compound of formula (I) 

by reaction of the compound of formula (II)

with trimethylsilylazide (TMSN3).It is currently believed that the reason for the stereospecificity is that the reaction
generates HN3in situ; other reagents which generate HN3in situ are well known to those
skilled in the art.The reaction is effected in a protic solvent. Preferably the solvent is a C1-8 alcohol in
particular a hindered alcohol. Hindered alcohols include for example isopropyl alcohol
and, particularly, tert-butyl alcohol.The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature of for example 0-150°C,
preferably at 15-90°C such as about 80°C.
