<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photographic solid
developing composition and a method for processing
photographic light-sensitive materials which uses a developer
prepared from said solid developing composition. More
specifically, the present invention relates to a solid
developing composition for silver halide photographic light-sensitive
materials and a processing method using the same,
which cause neither contrast reduction nor sensitivity
fluctuation in continuous processing of low replenishing rate.There has been widely known and practiced a continuous
processing system which continuously processes a light-sensitive
material in an automatic processor being replenished
at a constant rate. Reduction of waste liquors is urgently needed in recent
years for environmental protection, and there has been
demanded a realization of stable processing at a replenishing
rate as low as possible. Since reduction of the replenishing
rate prolongs the retention time of a processing solution in
the processor's tank, it causes troubles such as lowering in
contrast and fluctuation in sensitivity and thereby hinders
the processing from being run stably. Moreover, in
replenishers which are supplied to users mostly in the form of
concentrated solutions, decomposition and reaction of
ingredients in the solutions are liable to proceed, causing
fluctuation in photographic properties during continuous
processing. And such a fluctuation becomes larger as the
replenishing rate becomes smaller. It is useful to supply a
solid processing agent to users to have them prepare a
processing solution by themselves before use, but it is still
inadequate for stable processing.As a result of studies to solve such problems, the
present inventors have found that a replenisher comprising a
solid developing composition containing a specific silver-sludge
inhibitor scarcely fluctuates in photographic
properties such as sensitivity, a γ value and a maximum
density during continuous processing. EP-A-0 529 526 discloses a developing solution for
silver halide photographic materials which contains a six-membered
heterocyclic compound having two nitrogen atoms as the
constituent atoms of the six-membered ring and mercapto
group, hydroxyl group and at least one substituent group
other than hydrogen atom and a five-membered heterocyclic
compound having one to three nitrogen atoms as the
constituent atoms of the five-membered ring and at least one
mercapto group. There is also disclosed a method for
processing a silver halide photographic material
