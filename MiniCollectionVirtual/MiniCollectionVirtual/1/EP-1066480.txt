<ABSTRACT>
Brush seals (22) are employed on steam turbine rotors (12) without the risk of causing thermal rotor bowing without compromising the sealing performance. In one form, a groove (32) in the rotor has an insert (34) in frictional contact with the brush seal. The non-uniform distribution of heat due to frictional contact between the brush seal (22) and proud portions of the rotor (12) is dissipated within the insert (34) such that adjoining rotor portions are substantially uniformly heated without causing thermal bow. In a further form, a groove (40) or grooves (42) are provided in the rotor surface adjacent to the brush seal (22) and maintain non-uniform heat distribution locally in the rotor without causing thermal bow of the rotor. In another form, a land (50) projects radially outwardly of the rotor surface in contact with the brush seal (22). The non-uniform distribution of heat due to frictional contact between proud portions of the land and the brush seal (22) dissipates into a uniform distribution of heat in the rotor proper to avoid thermal bowing. In a final form, the brush seal has frictional contact with bucket dovetail or wheel protrusions (60) spaced radially outwardly of the rotor such that non-uniform distribution dissipates into a uniform distribution within the rotor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ELIMINATING THERMAL BOWING OF STEAM TURBINE ROTORSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to apparatus and methods for eliminating thermal bowing of the rotor of a steam turbine resulting from non-uniform distribution of heat about the rotor due to frictional contact between a brush seal and a proud portion of the rotor.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSteam turbines for the generation of power typically include a continuous solid elongated shaft carrying the turbine wheels and buckets. Steam turbines of impulse design typically operate above the rotor's first bending critical frequency and often near the second bending critical frequency. Steam turbine rotors, however, often have proud or high spots on the rotor, resulting from operations or run-outs caused by machining operations. Brush seals can be used for sealing between the rotors and stationary components in steam turbines. Brush seals typically comprise a plurality of metal bristles projecting from the stationary component toward the rotating component, i.e., the rotor, with the tips of the bristles engaging with and bearing against the rotor surface. Sustained rubbing between the rotor and the brush seals can lead to thermal bowing of the rotor or exacerbate an existing bowed condition of the rotor. That is, the friction generated by contact between the rotor and the stationary brush seals leads to an uneven, i.e., non-uniform, temperature distribution about the circumference of the rotor. The proud portion of the rotor therefore becomes increasingly hotter than circumferentially adjacent portions of the rotor, resulting in non-uniform axial expansion of the rotor and hence a bow in the rotor. This non-uniform 

 .?.temperature distribution can be particularly pronounced during start-up when there is no cooling flow about the rotor.Thermal bowing of the rotor in steam turbines becomes an issue because bowing will cause an imbalance which can adversely affect the rotor dynamic behavior of the rotor system.Brush seals have previously been installed in steam turbines with an initial clearance sized to ensure that the bristles do not contact the rotor during start-up. This approach eliminates or minimizes rotor dynamics concerns with brush seals. However, sealing performance is significantly compromised.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with the present invention, the rotor is modified to accommodate brush seals without compromising their sealing performance, yet enabling operation of the turbine.

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. In a steam turbine having a rotor and a non-rotating component about the rotor carrying a brush seal for sealing engagement with the rotor, a method of substantially eliminating bowing of the rotor resulting from circumferentially non-uniform distribution of heat about the rotor due to frictional contact between the brush seal and a proud portion of the rotor, comprising the step of inhibiting circumferential non-uniform heat transfer to the rotor generated by frictional contact between the proud portion of the rotor and the brush seal.
2. A method according to Claim 1 including distributing heat generated by the frictional contact between the proud portion of the rotor and the brush seal substantially uniformly about the rotor.
3. A method according to Claim 1 including providing a groove in the rotor at an axial location corresponding to an axial location of the brush seal and providing an insert in said groove for engaging the brush seal.
4. A method according to Claim 3 including substantially uniformly heating said insert in a circumferential direction before substantially heating the rotor surrounding the groove to ensure substantial uniform circumferential distribution of heat from the insert to the rotor.
5. A method according to Claim 3 including limiting the contact between said insert and a surface defining said groove to limit heat transfer from the insert to the rotor.

9. A method according to Claim 1 including providing grooves in the rotor at locations on opposite axial, sides of the brush seal and spaced axially from the axial location of the contact between the brush seal and the rotor, thereby distributing heat generated by the frictional contact between the rotor and the brush seal substantially uniformly about the rotor at locations radially inwardly of bases of said grooves to prevent thermal bowing of the rotor.
