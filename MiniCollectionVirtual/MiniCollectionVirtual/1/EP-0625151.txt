<DESCRIPTION>
Thiazolyl-pyridlne derivatives and their use as gastric add secretion In¬ hibitorsThe present invention relates to novel substituted thiazole compounds, processes for their preparation, intermediates useful in their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use in therapy, in particular as gastric acid secretion inhibitors.The present invention therefore provides, compounds of structure (I) :n which1 R is optionally substituted phenyl;2 .R is Ci-galkyl or (CH2)nAr in which n is 0 to 2 and Ar is optionally substituted phenyl;R 3 i.s hydrogen or Cι_4alkyl;R is hydrogen, Cι_4alkyl, NR7R8 or OCi-^alkyl; R5 is hydrogen or Cχ_ alkyl;R6 is hydrogen, Cι_4alkyl or NR7R8;R7 and R8 are the same or different and are each hydrogen orCι_4alkyl or one of R7 and R8 is hydrogen and the other is hydroxyCι_4alkyl, or R7 and R8' together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a 5- or6-membered ring optionally containing one or more additional heteroatoms; and the salts thereof.Suitably, R is hydrogen or optionally substituted phenyl. Preferably R is an optionally substituted phenyl group. 

 1 Suitable substituted phenyl groups R include phenyl groups substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected fromC^-galkyl, C^-galkoxy, amino, Cι_galkylthio, halogen, cyano, hydroxy, carbamoyl, carboxy, C^-galkanoyl or trifluoromethyl. Preferred substituted phenyl groups are those substituted by a single substituent, in particular a methyl group, most preferably in the 2-position of the ring.Suitably, R 2 is Cχ_galkyl or (C__2)nAr; preferably R2 is Cχ_galkyl, in particular n-propyl.Suitably, n is 0 to 2, preferably n is 0 or 1.Suitable substituted phenyl groups Ar are as defined for substituted phenyl groups R .Suitably, R 3 i.s hydrogen or Cχ_4alkyl; preferably R3 is hydrogen.Suitably R4 is hydrogen, C _4alkyl, NR7R8 or OCι_4al l; preferably R4 is NR7R8.Suitably R^ is hydrogen or Cι_4al l; preferably R^ is hydrogen.Suitably R6 is hydrogen, 

 or NR7R8; preferably R^ is hydrogen.Suitably, R7 and R8 are the same or different and are each hydrogen or Cι_ alk l or one of R7 and R8 is hydrogen and the other is hydroxyCχ_4alkyl, or R7 and R8, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a 5- or 6-membered ring optionally containing one or more additional heteroatoms. Preferably R7 and R8 are the same and are both hydrogen. 

 Suitable 5- or 6-membered rings formed by R7 and R8, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, include, for example, pyrrolidino, morpholino,
