<ABSTRACT>
This method for positioning nuclear fuel assemblies side by side on a core plate of a reactor vessel, in which positioning is carried out by means of a handling tool and by means of removable guide modules placed in each location, consists, sequentially:   
&
cirf
&
  in positioning modules grouped in sets on almost all of the locations, with the exception of the peripheral locations of the core plate (P), 
&
cirf
&
  in positioning assemblies on a diagonal portion of the empty peripheral locations, 
&
cirf
&
  in withdrawing the set of adjacent modules of the following diagonal, 
&
cirf
&
  in depositing the withdrawn set of modules on a storage area (S),    
&
cirf
&
  in positioning assemblies in the locations thus freed, 
&
cirf
&
  finally, in repeating the same sequence of operations on the following diagonals until almost all of the locations have been filled.   The invention also relates to a set of modules for implementing this method.
