propulsion device 1 provided with a clutch operating 

device that can easily be installed comprises a shift slider 
40 axially slidable within a propeller shaft 9 to move a 

clutch gear 30 through a clutch shifter pin 38 inserted 
through the propeller shaft; and an operating member capable 

of operating the shift slider from above a gear case 5; the 
operating member includes: a shift fork 50 engaged with a 

fork engaging portion 35c of the shift slider, to move the 
shift slider; a guide member 59 supporting the shift fork 

movable in a specific direction; a rotary rod member 55 
engaged with a rod engaging section 50b of the shift fork to 

move the shift fork; and a support member 51 drivably 
supporting the rod member and fixedly supporting the guide 

member, thereby sub-assembling the rod member and the guide 
member to transmit the operation of the rod member to the 

shift fork; the shift fork is so assembled to be engaged with 
the fork engaging section of the shift slider by fitting the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drive
transmission system for a vessel propulsion device such as
an outboard motor, inboard-outboard motor and so forth in
which power is transmitted through a clutch.In most vessel propelling equipment, output
power of an engine is transmitted downward by means of a
vertical shaft to a propeller shaft. There is provided a
clutch mechanism between the vertical shaft and the propeller
shaft. The clutch mechanism is composed of two bevel gears
rotatably supported on the propeller shaft and driven by the
vertical shaft to rotate in opposite directions to each
other, and a clutch gear rotatable together with the
propeller shaft and slidable along the propeller shaft. The
clutch gear is engaged with either bevel gear according to
its sliding direction to rotate the propeller shaft in a
normal direction or a reverse direction.In vessel propelling equipment disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 50-21493, the above-mentioned
clutch gear is connected to an annular member
axially slidably fitted around the propeller shaft by means
of a slider so that the clutch gear can be slided by sliding
the annular member. The annular member is provided with a
groove on the periphery and an engaging pin eccentrically
hanging down from a lower end of a vertical manipulating
shaft (shift rod) is engaged with the groove.With the rotation of the shift rod the engaging
pin rocks back and forth to move the annular member back and
forth, thus operating the clutch.Since the annular member, however, rotates
normally and reversely at a high speed together with the
propeller shaft, with the engaging pin in the lower part of 
the shift rod engaging and sliding in contact with the groove
in the outer periphery of the annular member, and the annular
member is pressed back and forth by the engaging pin while
rotating at a high speed, deviation of the shaft center and
vibration of the shaft, if slight, are likely to exercise
influence on the operation. It is, therefore, necessary to
be greatly careful in manufacturing and mounting a support
structure of an operation system in order to insure reliable
operation of the drive transmission system.Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 57-160796
discloses another outboard motor. Fig. 16 shows the lowermost
part of the outboard motor. On a propeller shaft 01 having
a propeller (not shown) fitted at the rear end are rotatably
supported a front driven gear 03 and a rear driven gear 04.
These driven gears 03, 04 are bevel gears meshed with a drive
gear (not shown)
