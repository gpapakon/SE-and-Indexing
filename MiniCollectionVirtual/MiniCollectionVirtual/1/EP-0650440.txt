<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a corrugated thermoplastic blank for a container. The blank (20) has a base panel (24) with wall panels (26, 28, 30, 32) connected to the base panel (24) by fold lines (38). The fold lines (38) comprise weld lines which destroy the original memory of the thermoplastic material. The free edges of the blank are sealed by seals (38) which prevent water from entering the blank. The sealed free edges and/or the weld lines or line (38) surround and reinforce each panel (26, 28, 30, 32) and increase the strength of each panel and thereby the strength of a container erected from the blank.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a corrugated thermoplastic blank for producing a 
container as defined in the preamble of claim 1. Such a blank is known from 
WO-A-8 605 159.  
 Corrugated thermoplastic sheet has proved to be unsuitable for the construction 
of boxes especially where relatively heavy loads are to be carried in such 
boxes. These relatively heavy loads may comprise fish or vegetables which 
weigh in the order of 4 to 15 kilograms. Boxes constructed from the 
corrugated thermoplastic sheet have been too weak for these loads. Such 
corrugated thermoplastic sheet has traditionally been 3 to 4 mm thick and has 
had a weight of approximately 600 grams per m2 with a buckling load 
resistance index of about 100. This sheet could simply be made thicker and 
heavier to increase its strength. However by increasing the thickness and the 
weight of the sheet, more material is used and consequently it is not cost 
effective to increase the thickness and the weight of the sheet to increase the 
strength of the sheet. It is an object of this invention to provide a lightweight yet sufficiently strong 
blank made of corrugated thermoplastic sheet. The applicant has addressed the above objective by increasing the overall 
thickness of the sheet whilst using substantially the same amount of material 
as used in prior art sheets. The skins and flutes of this sheet are thus thinner  
 
than the prior art sheets. However such sheet is unsuitable for the 
construction of the required boxes since the flutes can collapse as the skins 
move relative to one another. It is accordingly a further object of this invention to provide a reinforced 
lightweight, corrugated thermoplastic blank which can be used to produce a 
box of sufficient strength. Corrugated thermoplastic boxes have suffered from the disadvantage that water 
can be trapped between the two skins of the corrugated sheet. Such water, 
besides adding to the weight of a box, can promote the growth of bacteria 
which is obviously undesirable especially in food applications. The thermoplastic material, especially polypropylene, has a memory which is 
not destroyed by the creation of fold lines which are created in the same 
manner in which fold lines are created in corrugated cardboard blanks. Thus 
even after a fold line has been created on a sheet of polypropylene in the 
traditional corrugated cardboard manner, the sheet is not easily folded along 
that line because it tends to return to its original unfolded planar shape because 
of its memory. It is

<CLAIMS>
A container blank (20) made of corrugated thermoplastic sheet (8) having 
two skins (10) spaced from one another by flutes (12) includes a base panel (24) 

connected to wall panels (26,28) by fold lines (38) each comprising a weld line 
welding the two skins (10) together and reducing or destroying the 

original memory of the thermoplastic along the length of the weld 
line, and wherein the free edges of the blank are sealed (48) to prevent 

liquid from entering the blank (20), with the sealed free edges (48) and/or the 
weld lines surrounding and reinforcing each panel (24,26,28) thereby 

increasing the strength of each panel of the blank and thereby the 
strength of a container erected from the blank (20) characterized in that, the 

corrugated thermoplastic sheet (8) being between 5mm and 10mm thick and having 
a weight of between 400 grams/m
2
 and 850 grams/m

. 
The blank of claim 1 wherein the corrugated thermoplastic sheet (8) is 
between 6.0mm and 7.5mm thick. 
The blank of claim 1 wherein the corrugated thermoplastic sheet (8) has 
a weight of between 400 grams/m
2
 and 700 grams/m
2

The blank of claim 1 wherein the panels (24,26,28) of the blank have a 
buckling load resistance index of between 300 and 500. 
The blank of claim 1 including a plurality of apertures (40) in at least 
one of the panels with the edges (42) of the apertures being sealed. 
The blank of claim 1 wherein at least one of the panels includes at 
least one weld (44) within its periphery which increases the strength of 

the panel. 
The blank of claim 1 wherein the thermoplastic is polypropylene. 
A container erected from the blank as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
7.
