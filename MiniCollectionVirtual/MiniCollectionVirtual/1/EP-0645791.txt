<ABSTRACT>
The circuit breaker comprises a rotary operating handle (1), a casing (2) consisting of a cover (2a) and of a base (2b), an intermediate actuating element (3) actuated by the operating handle so as to act on an axially movable sprung cage (4), a transverse electrical bridge (5) and two electrical studs (7). The sprung case (4) comprises a support axis (9) provided with a diametral aperture (12) accommodating the electrical bridge and a main spring (13) centred in the diametral aperture in order to act axially against the electrical bridge in order to place it, at the bottom of the diametrical aperture when the electrical bridge is not in contact with the heads (7a) of the electrical studs and in order to exert an axial compression force on the electrical bridge by pressing it against the heads (7a) of the electrical studs so as to make the electrical contact between the studs (7) via the electrical bridge.
