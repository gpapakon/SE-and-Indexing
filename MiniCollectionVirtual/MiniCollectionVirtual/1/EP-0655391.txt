<ABSTRACT>
A material handling container (10) of the 
type for packaging, shipping and inventorying goods 

and of the type for stacking one upon the other 
when not in use, made of molded thermoplastic and 

having a plurality of plastic reinforcement members 
(86) arranged in predetermined positions about the 

plastic planer expanses (84) of the container (10) 
for adding strength and stiffness. The 

reinforcement members (86) define a plurality of 
hollow channels (88) disposed adjacent to the 

planer expanses (84) of the container (10) and 
including at least one rib (90) extending upwardly 

from the channel (88) defined the reinforcement 
member (80) for adding strength and stiffness to 

the planer expanse (84) of the container (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a container. An
illustrative material handling container is of the
type for packaging, shipping, and inventorying
goods. More specifically, an illustrative
embodiment of the invention relates to a reusable,
molded thermoplastic container which is collapsible
when empty and stackable in either the collapsed or
upright position in order to reduce the space
required to ship or inventory goods stored in the
container.Material handling containers used for
packaging, shipping and inventorying goods are well
known in the art. For example, United States
Patent No. 4,591,065 issued to Foy on March 27,
1986; United States Patent No. 4,917,255 issued to
Foy et al. on April 17, 1990; United States Patent
No. 4,923,079 issued to Foy; United States Patent
No. 4,674,647 issued to Gynge et al. on June 23, 
1987; United States Patent No. 4,775,068 issued to
Reiland et al. on October 4, 1988; and United
States Patent No. 5,094,356 issued to Miller on
March 10, 1992 all disclose collapsible containers
having a base and four walls which are hingedly
connected to the base. The walls are moveable
between a collapsed position where the walls are
folded one on top of the other and an upright
position where the walls extend vertically upward
from the base to define an interior of the
container.Containers of the type disclosed in the
patents listed above are made of plastic and are
generally the largest of their class having
dimensions ranging from approximately 1.02-1.14 m (40-45 inches)
in width, x approximately 1.22 m (48 inches) in length, x
approximately 0.63-0.99 m (25-39 inches) in height. Typically,
in the prior art, each wall and base of such
containers are molded separately using a structural
foam molding process. The structural foam molding
process is often employed to mold large parts such
as those which make up a collapsible container.
This is a low pressure molding process in which a
gas foaming agent, typically nitrogen, is
introduced upstream of the mold foam material, 
typically a high density polyethylene plastic. The
foaming agent aids the material to spread out and
fill the entire mold until the mold is fully
packed. The gas foaming agent defuses out of the
material leaving a porous part having a cellular
structure.However, there are certain disadvantages
attendant with structural foam plastic molded
containers. For example, the minimum wall
thickness required when using structural foam is
6.35 mm (.250 inches). Further, large parts such as walls
and bases need to be reinforced with

<CLAIMS>
A material handling container (10) of the type for packing,
shipping and inventorying goods and of the type for stacking one upon the

other when not in use, said container comprising:

a molded thermoplastic container (10) including a plurality of
planer expanses (84) in each wall defined by a plurality of plastic reinforcement members

(86) integrally molded with the container at predetermined positions on said
plastic planer expanses (84) of said container (10);
said plurality of reinforcement members (86) each defining a
hollow channel (88) disposed adjacent to one of said planer expanses

(84) and each including at least one rib (90) extending along the length of
the reinforcement member and upwardly from said channel (88)

defined by said member (86) for adding strength to said planer expanses (84)
of said container (10).
A container (10) as set forth in Claim 1 further characterized
by said reinforcement members (86) including a pair of upstanding ribs (90)

disposed in spaced parallel relationship with respect to each other and
extending upwardly from said channel (88). 
A container (10) as
set forth in claim 2 further characterized by said

hollow channel (88) defined by said reinforcement
members (86) including a bottom wall (92) formed by

said planer expanse (84) and a pair of upstanding
flanges (94) disposed spaced from one another and

a truss member (96) extending between said flanges
(94) and spaced from said bottom wall (92) of said

channel (88).
A container (10) as
set forth in claim 3 further characterized by said

upstanding flanges (94) integrally defining said
upstanding ribs (90) at said flanges (94) upper

margins such that said reinforcement member (86) is
substantially H-shaped in cross-section.
A container (10) as
set forth in claim 4 further characterized by said

material handling container including a collapsible
container (10) having a base (12), a pair of

sidewalls (14) and a pair of end walls (16), each
of said walls (14, 16) hingedly connected to said 

base (12) and moveable between a collapsed position
wherein said walls (14, 16) are folded one on top

of the other and an upright position wherein said
walls (14, 16) extend vertically upward from said

base (12) to define an interior (18) of said
container (10);


said base (12) and said walls (14, 16)
each defining planer expanses (84) and having a

plurality of reinforcement members (86) arranged in
predetermined spaced positions on said base (12)

and walls (14, 16) for adding strength to said
container (10).
