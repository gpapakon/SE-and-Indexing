<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for machining a thin film on a substrate by use of a laser precisely at a high speed, 

and a liquid crystal panel patterned by use of the apparatus and method. This apparatus comprises a plurality of 
pulse laser oscillators, means for driving the plural laser oscillators cyclically by shifting the phase of the oscillation 

cycle of each of the laser oscillators, means for uniformalizing the quality of laser beam from each of the oscillators, 
means for producing an elliptically polarized beam from the beam from each of the oscillators, means for splitting 

each of the beams emitted from the laser oscillators into plural beams. The apparatus selectively directs the plural 
beams thus produced by the splitting means onto an object to be machined. As the splitting means, a phase grating of 

irregular surface type which is designed to produce plural beams having the same intensity can be used. In this way, 
it is possible to form electrode gaps having a uniform quality and a uniform shape. The liquid crystal panel has an 

electrode structure where electrode gaps are formed in an ITO film by use of the laser apparatus and method described 
above. Since the electrode gaps having approximately the same width of 10 Âµm or less are formed uniformly in 

a display area at approximately the same intervals, the contrast and visibility, the major factors for controlling the 
quality of display of a liquid crystal panel, are significantly enhanced as compared to conventional panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser machining apparatus and method according to the preamble
of claims 1 and 16 (see US-A-5029243).There are various types of known laser machining apparatus. These include a CO2 laser
apparatus that is a popular technique to cut or bore a metal plate, and a YAG laser apparatus
that is broadly used to perform high precision machining of a thin metal sheet. In particular, the
YAG laser apparatus is a useful tool for various kinds of high precision machining owing to its
small size, easy maintenance, and high performance that can readily provide a laser beam
focused into a spot with a diameter of a few tens microns. Another advantage of the YAG
laser is that the second harmonic wave (at a wavelength of 532 nm) is available to perform
precision machining on a thin film using the ablation effect. The "ablation" means here an
effect that when a macromolecular material is illuminated with a short-pulse laser beam with a
short wavelength such as an excimer laser or YAG harmonic laser, the illuminated portion is
instantaneously decomposed, vaporized, and scattered, whereby the very limited portion
illuminated with the laser beam is removed. In fact, Q-switched YAG lasers are used in various
applications such as correction of defects of a semiconductor production mask, patterning of
detecting portions of a thin film sensor, patterning of electrodes of a liquid crystal display
panel, etc. The Q-switched laser is preferably used in these application fields because it can
provide a laser beam with a high peak power for a short pulse duration thereby performing high
quality machining on a material to be machined without giving thermal damage. For further
detailed information on the ablation machining technique, refer to "Application of a Short-Wavelength
Short-Pulse Laser to Ablation Machining" (The Journal of the Institute of Precision
Engineering, Vol.3, pp.473-478 (1993)).One of important applications of thin film machining techniques is patterning of transparent
electrodes of a liquid crystal panel, in which high quality machining and high machining
capability are required. In general, electrodes of a liquid crystal panel are patterned by
illuminating a transparent conductive film coated on a substrate with a laser beam while
moving the substrate relative to the laser beam, thereby cutting the conductive film along lines
spaced from each other at a predetermined distance. The machining quality and thus the
electrical characteristics of the conductive film depend on the
