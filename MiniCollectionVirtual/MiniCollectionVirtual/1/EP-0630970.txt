<ABSTRACT>
A process for production of canthaxanthin comprising 
the steps of culturing a microorganism capable of 

producing canthaxanthin and belonging to the genus 

Corynebacterium
, such as 
Corynebacterium
 sp. SQH 348 
(FERM BP-4284), and recovering canthaxanthin from the 

culture. 
The present producer microorganism produces mainly 
all-trans type canthaxanthin which is the naturally 

occurring type canthaxanthin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
production of canthaxanthin which is one of carotenoid
pigments. Canthaxanthin produced by the present process
is useful as a natural red pigment in fodder additives,
food additives, cosmetics and the like.It is known that canthaxanthin is present in a
mushroom (Botanical Gazette 112, 228-232, 1950), fishes,
and crustaceans (Carotenoids of Aquatic Organisms, Nippon
Suisan Gakukai, 1978). In addition as microorganisms
producing canthaxanthin, microorganisms belonging to the
genus Brevibacterium (Applied and Environmental
Microbiology, 55(10), 2505, 1989), and microorganisms
belonging to the genus Rhodococcus (Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2-138996) are known.
Moreover, canthaxanthin can be chemically synthesized by
oxidation of Î²-carotene (J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 78, 1427
(1956)) and synthesis from a novel 3-oxo-C15 phosphonium
salt ([5 - (2, 6, 6, trimethyl - 3 -oxo - 1 - cyclohexene -1-yl)-
3 - methyl - 2, 4 -pentadienyl] triphenylphosphonium
bromide) (Pure Appl. Chem. 51, 875 (1979)).The conventional processes, however, have various
drawbacks; for example, extraction from natural products
is expensive, raw materials are not stably available,
productivity by microorganisms is low, and products are
accompanied with a lot of impurity. It is problematic
touse chemically synthesized canthaxanthin due to safety
problems.The present invention provides a simple process for
production of canthaxanthin having high purity and being
safe.The present inventors carried out various attempts 
to develop a process for production of canthaxanthin
using microorganisms. As a result the present inventors
found that microorganisms belonging to the genus
Corynebacterium accumulate a high concentration of
canthaxanthin in their cells, and completed the present
invention. The present invention relates to a process
for production of canthaxanthin comprising culturing a
microorganism having an ability to produce canthaxanthin
and belonging to the genus Corynebacterium, and
extracting and purifying canthaxanthin accumulated in the
cells to obtain canthaxanthin.Fig. 1 represents an infrared absorption spectrum of
canthaxanthin produced according to the present
invention.Fig. 2 represents a result of mass analysis of
canthaxanthin produced according to the present
invention.Fig. 3 represents a 13C nuclear magnetic resonance
of canthaxanthin produced according to the present
invention.According to the present invention, any
microorganism belonging to the genus
