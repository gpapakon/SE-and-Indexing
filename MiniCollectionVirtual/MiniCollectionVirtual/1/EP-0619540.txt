<ABSTRACT>
A digital clock circuit (10) generates a high-speed clock (14) 
and window pulses (58) substantially centered about transitions of 

the high-speed clock in one quadrant (12) of an integrated circuit 
(IC) and routes the high-speed clock and window pulses to other 

quadrants (18, 19, 20) of the IC where a low-speed clock generator 
develops a low-speed clock signal from the window pulses. A 

control circuit (130) checks alignment between the high-speed and 
low-speed clock signals and adjusts first (90) and second (92) 

shift registers to control the delay in generating the low-speed 
clock as necessary to maintain alignment. The first shift register 

controls the falling edge of the low-speed clock signal and the 
second shift register controls the rising edge of the low-speed 

clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to digital clock
circuits and, more particularly, to a digital clock circuit for
synchronizing the edges of a low-speed clock signal to a high-speed
clock signal.Many digital systems use two or more clock signals operating
at different frequencies for transferring data throughout the
system. A common procedure for generating a high-speed clock and
a low-speed clock is to feed an external clock source into a phase
lock loop (PLL) and develop the high-speed clock signal at the
output of the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) of the PLL. The
low-speed clock may be taken at the output of a divide-by-N
circuit in the feedback path between the output of the VCO and the
phase detector of the PLL. The high-speed and low-speed clock
signals are buffered and routed throughout the system to perform
the intended functions.The logic circuit using the high-speed and low-speed clock
signals may be a considerable distance from the PLL generation
source. Therefore, the transitions of the high-speed clock signal
and the low-speed clock signal can become misaligned at various
points in the system primarily due to differences in propagation
delay and capacitive loading in the different paths. In many
applications, it is critical to have accurate alignment of the high-speed
clock signal and the low-speed clock signal at the point of
utilization. Otherwise, data may be clocked at the wrong points
resulting in invalid data transfers. Thus, circuit designers have
typically invested considerable time and effort into detailed
analysis of the propagation paths to ensure proper alignment of the
high-speed and low-speed clock signals at key points in the
system. Unfortunately, the difficulty in aligning the clock edges of
the different frequency clock signals often forces the designers to
use more setup and hold time for the data transfers which limits
the operating speed and bandwidth of the system. Hence, a need exists for an improved clock generation circuit and method
for providing proper alignment between the clock edges of high-speed
and low-speed clock signals at the point of usage.US5144170 discloses a clock alignment circuit for
generating a low speed clock signal from a high speed clock signal
in accordance with the preamble of the independent claims.Briefly stated, the invention comprises a circuit for
generating first and second clock signals including first means for
generating the first clock signal and further generating window
pulses each substantially centered about a
