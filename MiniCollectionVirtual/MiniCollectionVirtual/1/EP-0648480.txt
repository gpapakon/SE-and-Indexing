<ABSTRACT>
Wound implant materials are described comprising a 
plurality of bioabsorbable microspheres bound together by a 

bioabsorbable matrix, such as in a freeze-dried collagen 
matrix. The microspheres preferably comprise over 30% of 

the volume of the material, and preferably have diameters of 
10 µm to 1500 µm. The microspheres and/or the matrix 

preferably comprise a polylactic/polyglycolic copolymer, 
collagen, cross-linked collagen, hyaluronic acid, cross-linked 

hyaluronic acid, an alginate or a cellulose 
derivative. The resulting implants are stronger and more 

slowly resorbed than conventional collagen sponge implants. 
Better control over the porosity of the implant is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel bioabsorbable
materials for use as or in wound implants, and to methods of
preparation of those materials.Healing of cavity wounds depends on the production by
the wound of substantial quantities of matrix materials and
granulation tissue as natural filler, and the dekeratinization
and migration of cells at the periphery of
the wound across the moist surface of the neoangiogenic
matrix. Currently, such wounds are treated with dressings
designed to maintain a moist environment and to prevent
fluid loss, infection, adherence and trauma. Additionally,
alginates and hydrocolloids have been used to absorb excess
exudate and contribute to granulation induction. These
materials have the obvious disadvantage that they are not
designed to be 'absorbed' by the wound and therefore must be
removed from the cavity, usually with irrigation and
disruption of wound reparation.An effective alternative to alginates and
hydrocolloids would be similar materials constructed from
absorbable biomaterials with a determined pharmacological
fate that could be left in situ throughout and after wound
healing. Hitherto, the materials suggested for this purpose
have included bioabsorbable sponges formed by freeze-drying
solutions or suspensions of bioabsorbable polymers.Advantageously, these bioabsorbable polymers are
natural biopolymers such as collagen, fibrin, fibronectin
or hyaluronic acid. Such materials are not only highly
biocompatible and biodegradable, but they can also assist
wound healing by promoting the proliferation of fibroblasts,
and by promoting angiogenesis.For example, US-A-4970298 (Frederick H. Silver et al)
describes a biodegradable collagen matrix suitable for use
as a wound implant. The matrix is formed by freeze drying
a dispersion containing collagen, crosslinking the collagen
via two crosslinking steps and freeze-drying the crosslinked
matrix. The matrix may also contain hyaluronic acid and
fibronectin. WO90/00060 (Collagen Corporation) describes collagen
implants that are formed by flash freezing and then freeze-drying
a suspension of collagen fibrils without chemical
cross-linking. The implants have a bulk density of 0.01 to
0.3 g/cm3 and a pore population in which at least about 80%
of the pores have an average pore size of 35 to 250 µm.
This wound healing matrix also serves as an effective
sustained delivery system for bioactive agents.EP-A-0274898 (Ethicon Inc.) describes an absorbable
implant material having an open cell, foam-like structure
and formed from
