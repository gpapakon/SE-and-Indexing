<ABSTRACT>
A signal reproducing apparatus for receiving a 
broadcasting signal transmitted in the form of a multiplex 

signal added with data concerning classification of 
broadcasting content includes a reception unit, a 

demodulating unit, a signal processing unit, an 
identification unit and a control unit. The reception unit 

receives the broadcasting signal. The demodulating unit 
demodulates an output signal supplied thereto from the 

reception unit and also demodulates the data concerning 
classification of broadcasting content contained in the 

output signal from the reception unit. The signal processing 
unit or reproduction unit is supplied with an output signal 

from the demodulating unit and reproduces the output signal 
supplied thereto. The identification unit is supplied with 

an output signal from the demodulating unit and identifies 
the demodulated data supplied thereto. The control unit 

controls the supply of power to the demodulating unit, the 
signal processing unit and the identification unit. The 

control unit energizes the demodulating unit and the 
identification unit when the power switch of the apparatus is  

 
turned off under the condition that a mode for receiving 

broadcasting of a predetermined broadcasting classification 
represented by the data concerning the broadcasting content 

is set. Also, when the identified result from the 
identification unit shows that the broadcasting of the 

predetermined broadcasting classification is carried out, the 
control unit generates a channel selection control signal to 

the demodulating unit based on the identified result from the 
identification unit and energizes the signal processing unit 

to reproduce a signal obtained when a channel-selected 
broadcasting signal is demodulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reception
apparatus, a signal reproducing apparatus using the reception
apparatus and a control method thereof. More particularly,
this invention relates to a reception apparatus for receiving
data multiplex broadcasting, a signal reproducing apparatus
using the reception apparatus and a control method thereof.In European countries, FM audio broadcast service
is initiated to broadcast an audio signal in the form of a
broadcast signal added with data concerning broadcast
contents. This broadcasting service that just started in
European countries is called a Radio Data System (RDS). FM
broadcasting based on the RDS (hereinafter simply referred to
as "RDS broadcast") will be described below.As shown in FIGURE 1 of the accompanying drawings,
a baseband signal of an FM broadcast signal is transmitted in
the multiplexed form of a main signal M (sum signal L+R in
the case of stereo broadcasting) and a stereo signal S
(difference signal L-R), and a stereo pilot signal P is
assigned to a frequency band of 19 kHz. This is the same as
the ordinary FM stereo broadcast signal.In the case of the RDS broadcast, a sub-carrier
signal SC is assigned to a frequency band of 57 kHz which is 
three times as high as the frequency of the stereo pilot
signal P. RDS data R is modulated by the sub-carrier signal
SC.The RDS data R is composed of grouped digital data
as shown in FIGURE 2. As shown in FIGURE 2, one group is
composed of 4 blocks and each block is composed of 26-bit
data. Of 26 bits, 16 bits are assigned to practical data
representing broadcast contents or the like, and remaining 10
bits are assigned to an error correction code. The 16-bit
data in respective blocks are defined individually.Data transmitted according to the above-mentioned
format are mainly as follows:
PS code ... Character data representing broadcast
station namePI code ... ID (identification) code of broadcast
program, country name code, program code, etc.TP code ... Traffic information broadcast station
ID signalTA code ... Traffic information broadcasting ID
signalPTY code ... Program content ID code representing
contents of news, sports and music of each genreEON code ... ID code representing broadcast
contents of other broadcast stationThe listener can learn the present broadcast 
contents of a certain broadcast station by using these codes
and also can learn broadcast contents of other broadcast
station.. By using the TP code representing that the traffic
information broadcasting is carried out, for example, it
