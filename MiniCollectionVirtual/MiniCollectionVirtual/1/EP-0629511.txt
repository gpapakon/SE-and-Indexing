<ABSTRACT>
A recording material contains both a microcapsule 
containing an electron-donating color former dissolved in a 

solvent and an electron-accepting developer. The solvent 
comprises a glyceride and the electron-donating color 

former comprises a fluoran compound of the formula: 

in which R¹ represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon 
atoms, R² represents a branched alkyl group of 4 to 12 

carbon atoms or a tetrahydrofurfuryl group, and each of R³ 
and R⁴ represents independently a hydrogen atom, a halogen 

atom or a methyl group, provided that R¹ differs from R².

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording material
which is employable for a pressure sensitive material and a
heat sensitive material.Recording materials that contain both a microcapsule
containing an electron-donating color former (hereinafter
may be referred to as "color former") dissolved in a
solvent and an electron-accepting developer (hereinafter
may be referred to as "developer"), are widely used. In
the recording material, the color former reacts with the
developer to form a colored image.Such recording material is roughly divided into a
pressure sensitive material and a heat sensitive material.
The pressure sensitive material utilizes the mechanisms
that the microcapsule containing the color former is
ruptured by application of pressure to form a color image
through the reaction of the color former with the developer.
The pressure sensitive recording material includes a
no-carbon-paper-type recording material that a color former
layer comprising a microcapsule containing a color former
(hereinafter may be referred to as "color former layer")
and a developer layer containing an electron-accepting
developer (hereinafter may be referred to as "developer
layer") are respectively formed on surfaces of separate
supports or separate surfaces of one support and are in
contact with each other to be used; and a self-coloring-type
pressure sensitive recording material (e.g., pressing-type
paper or self-contained paper) comprising a self-coloring
layer having both the color former and the developer
provided on one side surface of a support. The no-carbon-paper-type recording material consists
of a upper paper having a color former layer provided on
one side surface of a support (which usually is paper
sheet), an intermediate paper having a color former layer
provided on one side surface of a support and a developer
layer on another side surface of the support, and a lower
paper having a developer layer provided on one side surface
of a support. The intermediate paper is usually used in
the form of two or more sheets. Such no-carbon-paper-type
recording material is employed by bringing the color former
into contact with the developer to form a colored image.In the self-coloring-type pressure sensitive recording
material, when pressure is applied to a surface having a
self-coloring layer, a microcapsule in the layer is ruptured
to form a color image on the self-coloring layer
through the reaction of the color former with the developer.
Therefore, the material is usually employed for
writing or drawing an
