<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing 2-chlorobutadiene-1,3 ("chloroprene") by
means of the dehydrochlorination of 3,4-dichloro-1-butene
(DCB) and, in particular, to a process for
preparing chloroprene by starting from DCB, in which
DCB is dehydrochlorinated with lime.The present process for preparing chloroprene
consists in dehydrochlorinating DCB with sodium
hydroxide. The consumption of sodium hydroxide is
stoichiometric, and, consequently, the cost thereof
strongly increases the total process costs.Therefore, attempts were carried out in the past
in order to develop less expensive solutions than
using sodium hydroxide. US-A-3,079,446 describes a process for the production of 2-halo-1,3-butadiene,
comprising a step of heating of 1,2-dihalo-3-butene at a
temperature of from 80°C to 120°C with an alkali metal hydroxide in the
presence of both water and an organic solvent chosen from the group
consisting of ether-alcohols and water soluble cyclic ether.JP-A-56 156 223 Patent Abstract of Japan Vol.6, No.40, 12.3.1982)
discloses a process for obtaining chloroprene thorough a long-term
continuous operation at a high reaction rate with little formation of polymers,
by reacting 3,4-dichlorobutene-1 with an aqueous solution of an alkali
metallic hydroxide in the presence of a sorbitol derivative. In particular, the replacement
of sodium hydroxide with less expensive lime was
proposed. The problem which had to be solved in this
case, derives from low lime reactivity.Some DCB dehydrochlorinating processes, using
lime as the basic reactant, are disclosed in some
patent references.So, e.g., JP-51/43 705 discloses a system
constituted by calcium hydroxide and sodium sulfate.
Said process is schematically represented by the
equation:
2CH2=CH―CH(Cl)=CH2Cl+Ca(OH)2+Na2SO4 →
2CH2=CH―C(Cl)=CH2+CaSO4+2NaCl+2H2OThe main drawback displayed by this process
consists in that two byproducts are produced, and
namely, calcium sulfate and sodium chloride. In particular, CaSO4, insoluble in water, should
be separated from the aqueous solution which contains
sodium chloride, This step adds up to the costs of the
overall process. Furthermore, the process disclosed in
this patent does not allow a quantitative conversion
to be obtained.This being the state of the art, the present
Applicant was able to develop a process for
dehydrochlorinating DCB into chloroprene, which
overcomes the above drawbacks.In accordance with the above, the present
invention relates to a process for preparing
chloroprene by means of
