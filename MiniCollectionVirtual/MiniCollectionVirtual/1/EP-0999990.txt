<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser (10) of wet wipes (45) from a coreless log (44) with a semi-cylindrical chimney member (26) in the lid (20) of the container (18) that houses the log (44) or houses a refill cartridge (12) in which the log (44) is disposed. The chimney member (26) is disposed and configured to shelter the main portion of a dispensing opening (35) without sealing the dispensing opening (35). The chimney member (26) influences the user to extract the wipe (45) in a way that reduces the incidence of streaming of wipes (45) from the log (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dispenser for wet wipes and 
particularly to such dispenser that receives a refill cartridge containing such 
wipes in the form of a perforated, coreless log or accommodates such wipes 
in the form of a log without a refill cartridge. Dispensing of wet wipes from conventional perforated, coreless logs is 
problematical. The typical design for a dispensing port for conventional 
coreless logs is a star-shaped dispensing hole disposed in a horizontal plane. 
The user has a natural tendency to withdraw the wipes vertically from this 
dispensing hole. However, if the user withdraws the wipes vertically from this 
dispensing hole design, the wipes tend to fail to separate along the 
perforations, and thus "streaming" results in withdrawal of several wipes one 
behind the other. This wastes the additional wipes beyond the one wipe that 
the user desired. To try to avoid streaming, the user must be instructed (as 
by printed instructions furnished on a printed label located near the hole) to 
pull the wipes sharply at a 45 degree angle. However, this action is not 
always successful in achieving separation along the first line of perforations 
and removing a single wipe. Moreover, the leading portion of next wipe to be 
dispensed, is partially exposed to the air and thus tends to dry out if not used 
immediately. This can lead to additional wastage. In one attempt to 
overcome streaming, the dispensing hole is made smaller. However, the 
wipes tend to get hung up in the hole and thus become difficult to dispense. Conventional refill packs are made from flexible films produced in 
flowpack lines. The logs are dropped into the film sack. The liquid is inserted 
into the sack. It may be necessary to use special barrier films in order to 
resist permeation of solvents through the film. The sack is sealed with a heat 
weld to form a refill pack. The user must orient the pack in the dispenser 
according to the printed instructions on the flowpack with the correct end of 
the pack facing the dispensing hole and then break the film to start the first 
wipe. Installing such refill packs by the user is somewhat difficult and often  
 
time-consuming, and the welded seams may be prone to leakage. With any 
store of wipes imbued with liquid, the force of gravity tends to drain the liquid 
from the wipes and cause the drained liquid to collect at the bottom of the 
refill pack. EP-A-0 006 709 discloses a closure for a dispenser-container for moist 
tissues, or the like, which minimises
