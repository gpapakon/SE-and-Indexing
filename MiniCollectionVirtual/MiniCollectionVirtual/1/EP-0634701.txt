<ABSTRACT>
An exposure apparatus includes an exposure 
device for exposing an exposure area of a substrate (3) 

through a pattern (21) of a mask (1), wherein the pattern 
involves writing error; and a correcting device for 

correcting the writing error of the pattern to 
correctly overlay the pattern on the exposure region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exposure
apparatus and a method of manufacturing devices using
the same.The recent progress of the semiconductor
device manufacturing and the fine processing related
thereto are remarkable. Particularly,
photolithography is mainly effected by reduction
projection exposure apparatus (stepper) having a
resolution of submicrons, and a larger numerical
aperture (NA) and further reduction of wavelength of
the light for the exposure are developed toward
further improvement in the resolution.One-to-one scanning type exposure apparatus
using reflection type projection optical system is
improved, for example, there are noted a reduction
projection optical system incorporating a refraction
element such as lens in a projection
optical system to combine with reflection element such
as mirror, or a scanning type exposure apparatus in
which a reduction projection optical system
constituted only by refraction elements are used, and
both of a mask stage and a wafer stage are moved in a
speed ratio corresponding to the reduction. As a factor influencing alignment between a mask
pattern and a wafer pattern, there is a deviation of EB
writing (electron beam writing) of the mask pattern
(original) from design pattern. Conventionally, the
deviation has been ignored because the amount of
deviation is small.According to one aspect the present invention
provides an exposure apparatus comprising:
means for exposing an exposure area (22) of a
substrate through a pattern of a mask, wherein said
pattern deviates in position, size or shape with respect
to a design pattern; andmeans for detecting the deviation of the pattern
wherein said exposure means is responsive to said
detecting means to effect its exposure operation so as
to compensate for the pattern deviation during exposure
of the substrate.According to a second aspect the present invention
provides an exposure method using a mask (4) having a
device pattern deviated in position, size or shape with
respect to a design pattern, the method comprising the
steps of:
detecting the deviation of the device pattern; andexposing a pattern area of a substrate while
compensating for the deviation of the device pattern.Embodiments of the present invention will now be
described with reference to the accompanying drawings in
which:Figure 1 is a schematic view illustrating an
apparatus according to an embodiment of the present
invention.Figure 2 illustrates scanning exposure in the
apparatus of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a flow chart for manufacturing a
