<ABSTRACT>
A tamper-evident closure device (11) for a 
container (10) has a tear tab (17) which can be at 

least partially detached by tearing to leave an opening 
(21) through which the contents of the container (10) 

can be removed. A roller (18) integral with one edge 
(17
b
) of the tab (17) has an operating member (19) for 
manually rotating the roller (18) back across the tab 

(17) from the one edge (17
b
) such that during such 
rotation the tab (17) is progressively torn away 

starting at the one edge (17
b
).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tamper-evident 
closure device for a container and is applicable, 
though not exclusively, to a bottle for sterile water 
or antiseptic liquid for use in hospitals. Closure devices are known which comprise a tear 
tab which normally seals the container but which can be 
at least partially detached by tearing to leave an 
opening through which the contents of the container can 
be removed. One example of such a device is the 
so-called "ring pull" closure for canned drinks, 
wherein a ring is attached to a tear tab and by pulling 
back on the ring the tab can be removed. Similar 
closure devices have been used on containers for other 
consumables, such as milk cartons. An advantage of such devices is that they are 
"tamper-evident", meaning that they cannot be re-sealed 
once opened so that any tampering can be detected. 
This is especially important when it is necessary to 
detect a possible contamination of the container 
contents. However, a disadvantage of such closure 
devices is that they require a relatively large force 
to start the tear. Further, once the initial tear is 
made the force required to continue the tear drops 
substantially so that the tab removal is uncontrolled 
and liquid spillage often results. It is an object of the invention to provide an 
improved closure device which mitigates this problem.  Accordingly, the invention provides a 
tamper-evident closure device for a container, 
comprising a tear tab which can be at least partially 
detached by tearing to leave an opening through which 
the contents of the container can be removed, the 
device further comprising a roller attached to the tab 
adjacent one edge and an operating member attached to 
the roller for manually rotating the roller back across 
the tab from the one edge whereby during such rotation 
the tab is progressively torn away starting at the said 
one edge. The closure device may be manufactured together 
with and as an integral part of a container or, 
alternatively, manufactured as a separate device for 
subsequent fitting to the neck of a container. 
Accordingly, the invention also provides a container 
having a closure device as described hereinabove. The advantage of the invention, as compared to 
the known ring-pull devices, is that a more 
controllable opening requiring less initial force can 
be achieved. Embodiments of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A tamper-evident closure device (11) for a 
container (10), comprising a tear tab (17) which can be 

at least partially detached by tearing to leave an 
opening (21) through which the contents of the 

container (10) can be removed, characterised in that 
the device (11) further comprises a roller (18) 

attached to the tab (17) adjacent one edge (17b) and an 
operating member (19) attached to the roller (18) for 

manually rotating the roller (18) back across the tab 
(17) from the one edge (17b) whereby during such 

rotation the tab (17) is progressively torn away 
starting at the said one edge (17b). 
A closure device (11) as claimed in claim 1, 

wherein a portion (19a) of the operating member (19) is 
attached to a portion (20) of the closure device (11) 

away from the roller (18) so as to prevent rotation of 
the roller (18) without breaking the attachment. 
A closure device (11) as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
further including means (22; 24) to latch the operating 

member (19) in an open condition of the container (10). 
A closure device (11) as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 
3, wherein the operating member (19) is a lever. 
A closure device (11) as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the length of the roller (18) is greater 

than the width of the tab (17) so that the ends of the 
roller (18) are supported by the closure device (11) on 

either side of the tab (17) during rotation of the 
roller (18). 
A closure device (11) as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein said device (11) has a skirt (13) for 

force fitting in the neck (14) of a container (10). 
A closure device (11) as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein the closure device (11) is made as a 

one-piece moulding of plastics material. 
A container (10) having a closure device (11) 
according to any one of the preceding claims.
