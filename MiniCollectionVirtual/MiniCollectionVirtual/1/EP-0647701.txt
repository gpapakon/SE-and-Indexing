<ABSTRACT>
A lubricant for refrigerators using a hydrofluorocarbon such as R134a, R32 or R125 as the refrigerant, 
and a refrigerant composition containing the same. The lubricant comprises a synthetic oil and a carbodiimide 

compound represented by the general formula R₁-N=C=N-R₂, wherein R₁ and R₂ represent each independently 
hydrogen or a hydrocarbon group which may contain nitrogen or oxygen. The refrigerant composition comprises 

the hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant and the lubricant in a specified ratio.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricant for use in refrigerators
and a refrigerant composition using same, more specifically, to a lubricant for
use in refrigerators employing a hydrofluorocarbon coolant such as R 134a
(1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane: Flon 134a), R 32 (difluoromethane: Flon 32), R 125
(pentafluoroethane: Flon 125) and a refrigerant composition using
same.Hydrocarbon coolants containing fluorine and chlorine such as
chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons have conventionally been
considered excellent for use as coolants for refrigerators as they are
chemically stable and have low toxicity. However, the recent Montreal Protocol
decided that the use of chlorofluorocarbons. for example R 12 (dichlorodifluoromethane:
Flon 12) shall be totally abolished by the year 1996, because
chlorofluorocarbons cause damage to the ozone layer in the stratosphere and
thereby contribute to global warming.While, hydrochlorofluorocarbons such as R 22
(monochlorodifluoromethane: Flon 22) have been expected to be used as
alternatives to R 12, various countries are conferring in order to abolish the 
use of R 22 by the early twenty-first century, since there is an uneasiness
concerning its damage to the ozone layer.Based on such circumstances, R 134a and a mixture of R 134a and R 32
have been noted as alternatives to R 12 and R 22 respectively. Also, hydrocarbon
coolants which do not contain chlorine in their molecular compositions such as
hydrofluorocarbon coolants as represented above have been expected to be used in
the future as coolants.However, because the polarity of hydrofluorocarbon coolants such as R
134a, R 32 is higher than that of R 12 or R 22, these
hydrofluorocarbon coolants have poor compatibility with naphthene mineral oils,
alkylbenzene and the like which have been conventionally employed as lubricants
for refrigerators. In order to improve upon said disadvantage as lubricants for
use in refrigerators using hydrofluorocarbon coolants, lubricants comprising
polyoxyalkylene glycol has been described in U.S. Patent No.4,755,316, Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 03-28296 and lubricants comprising esters have
been proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 03-505602, 03-88892, 03-128991,
03-128992.Since small amounts of water exist in compressors of the
refrigerators, if a compound having an ester linkage is present in the
refrigerator oils, there is the problem that the ester linkage may be hydrolyzed
to form free acid and said free acid may cause corrosion and sludge.In order to improve on
