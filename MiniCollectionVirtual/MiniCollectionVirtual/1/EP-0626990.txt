<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of olefins in an olefin plant, which includes an olefin pyrolysis furnace having pyrolysis tubes in which hydrocarbon feedstock is cracked, comprises introducing hydrocarbon feed substantially free of phosphorous-containing compounds into the pyrolysis furnace and operating the furnace under pyrolysis conditions producing olefin-containing effluent therefrom wherein the pyrolysis tubes have an effective passivator of metal catalytic sites bonded to the exposed metal surface by injecting an effective passivator into the furnace at a point above the dew point of water.

<DESCRIPTION>
 THERMAL CRACKING PROCESS WITH REDUCED COKINGCross-Reference to Related Applications This application is a continuation-in-part to U.S. Serial No.07/992,719 filed December 18, 1992, which is incorporated herein by reference.Background Of The InventionThis invention relates to a process for converting hydrocarbon feedstocks to olefins by thermal cracking in high temperature cracking or pyrolysis furnaces. In a particular aspect, the invention relates to such a process including steps for reducing formation of coke in pyrolysis furnaces and associated equipment such as transfer line exchangers.Olefins such as ethylene and propylene are produced by pyrolysis (thermal cracking) of petroleum gases (butane, ethane, propane, etc.) or of distillates such as naphtha, n-hexane and gas oil. The cracking reactions occur in a thermal reactor comprising tubes or coils inside a high- temperature furnace. During manufacture of olefins, steam can be added to the hydrocarbon feedstocks to reduce hydrocarbon partial pressure to promote production of olefins and to minimize rate of coke deposition. The cracking reactions occur under a reducing atmosphere in which there is substantially no oxygen present.Pyrolysis tubes are made of metal alloys which can withstand the high temperature and stress-strain relationship of production conditions and that are stable against carburization. A special 25% chrome-20% nickel alloy has been a preferred tube material for reactor coils. Materials having a still higher nickel content, which may be alloyed with minor amounts of carbide stabilizers such as tungsten and niobium (columbium), also are used. Such materials contain catalytic sites which promote the formation of catalytic coke. Typically, other portions of the cracker are made of lower grade steels which are less corrosion-resistant.Illustrative of olefins production, cracking of petroleum gases or distillates to produce ethylene is accomplished by passing the hydrocarbon feedstock at a positive pressure into a high-temperature cracking furnace composed of a feed section, a convection heating coil section and radiant coil cracking section; cracking the feed in the cracking furnace at a temperature in the range of from about 650°C to about 930°C 

and in the presence of steam, with the steam-to-hydrocarbon ratio typically in the range of from about 0.2:1 to about 1.5:1 ; pressurizing the cracking furnace effluent in a compressor from substantially atmospheric pressure; and fractionating the pressurized cracking furnace effluent,
