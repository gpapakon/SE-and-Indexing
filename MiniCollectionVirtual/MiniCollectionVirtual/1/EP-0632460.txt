<ABSTRACT>
A method and circuit for significantly reducing a 
delay added to a clock signal which clocks an output of a 

first circuit into an input of a second circuit in a 
semiconductor device. An output of a first circuit is 

connected to a data line. The first circuit is designed 
with elements having a selected set of design parameters, 

such as transistor dimensions and transistor orientation. 
A second circuit is connected to the data line and also 

receives a clock signal generated by a signal delay 
circuit. The signal delay circuit receives an output 

enable signal, and after a delay period, produces the clock 
signal in response to the output enable signal. At least a 

portion of the signal delay circuit utilizes elements 
having the selected set of design parameters utilized in 

the first circuit. Thus, as process variations affect the 
electrical properties and the speed of the transistors in 

the first circuit, the same process variations will 
proportionately affect the electrical properties and speed 

of transistors in the delay circuit. This automatically 
compensates for process-induced speed variations and 

eliminates the need for a time margin when providing a 
clock signal for clocking an output of a first circuit into 

the input of a second circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to 
semiconductor devices, and more particularly to internally 
synchronous digital semiconductor devices. Still more 
particularly, the present invention relates to delay 
circuits utilized to generate a clock signal for 
controlling an input circuit in a digital semiconductor 
device. Desirable design goals in electronic semiconductor 
manufacturing include a potential for significant cost 
reduction during the life of the design, high speed 
operation, low power consumption, and good reliability. In 
order to attain the goal of high speed operation, the many 
intermediate operations performed within the semiconductor 
device must be performed as quickly as possible, and with 
as little delay between operations as is practical to 
ensure reliable operation. Such intermediate operations 
may be synchronized by an internal clock signal. For 
example, if an output signal of a first intermediate 
operation is used as an input signal for a second 
intermediate operation, an internal clock signal may be 
utilized to synchronize the transfer of the output signal 
of the first intermediate operation to the input circuit of 
the second intermediate operation. Unfortunately, increasing the speed of a semiconductor 
device is not as simple as increasing the speed of the 
internal clock which synchronizes the intermediate 
operations. One obstacle to increasing the speed of a 
semiconductor device is the amount of time required to 
transfer an output signal from a circuit performing a first  
 
intermediate operation to an input of a circuit performing 
a second intermediate operation. One contributor to such a signal transfer delay is the 
operating speed of individual transistors within the 
semiconductor device. In many semiconductor devices, 
transistors are utilized in digital circuits in a manner 
that resembles an ordinary switch. However, such 
"transistor switches" do not "turn on" or "turn off" 
instantaneously; it takes a finite amount of time to move 
an electrical charge, which is sufficient to "turn on" or 
"turn off" the transistor, into or out of the semiconductor 
structure that forms the transistor. This time required to 
move a sufficient electrical charge to either "turn on" or 
"turn off" a transistor may be referred to as the 
transistor switching time and is typically in the range of 
a few nanoseconds. In addition to high speed transistor operation, 
another semiconductor device design goal is to make the 
transistors within the device as small as
