<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a box-like 
container construction specifically designed for 

packaging products. 
The box-like container construction 
(1) according to the invention comprises two half-shells 

(2,3) each made of a die-cut material sheet and having a 
concave shape on a side thereof defined by bending 

peripheral portions of said sheet. 
The two half-shells (2,3) can be superimposed 
onto one another with their concave sides facing to 

one another and a first (2) of said two half-shells being 
provided with at least a pair of closure tabs (4a,4b) which 

laterally extend from opposite portions toward the 
second half-shell (3) and engage within slot (5a,5b) defined on 

the side surface of the second half-shell (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a box-like 
container construction, which has been specifically 
designed for packaging products. As is known, for packaging bulk or loose 
products, for selling said products, there are 
conventionally used decorated paper packages, in 
which as a supporting base there is frequently used a 
tray element, made of a cardboard or other material, 
adapted to provide a required strength to the bottom 
of the package. In other cases, in particular as the 
packaging material must not contact the packaged 
products, there are used cardboard box containers, 
which are conventionally made starting from a 
cardboard die-cut sheet material and which are closed 
by a strip and, if desired, coated by or enveloped in 
a decorated paper. As stated, the packages which simply 
comprise a paper sheet and a rigid tray as a bottom 
of the package, are not adapted to prevent the 
contained products from contacting one another. On the other hand, in the case of a package 
comprising a box-like body, one has the drawback that  
 
the package must be closed by a strip or tape, for 
providing the box body with a proper resistance 
against an accidental opening. Moreover, prior box-like containers have 
generally poor aesthetic characteristics and, because 
of this reason, they must be enveloped by decorated 
paper. Accordingly, the aim of the present 
invention is to overcome the above mentioned 
drawbacks, by providing a box-like container 
construction which is specifically designed to resist 
against an accidental opening without requiring the 
application of a closure strip or tape. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is to 
provide such a box-like container construction, which 
can be made with a very small amount of material and 
which reduces to a minimum the waste of material 
during the making thereof. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a box-like container construction 
which can be made at a very reduced cost while having 
a very satisfactory aesthetic aspect.  Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a box-like container construction 
which occupies a very reduced space in a stored and 
shipment condition thereof. According to one aspect of the present 
invention, the above mentioned aim and objects, as 
well as yet other objects, which will become more 
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a box-like 
container construction, particularly for packaging 
products, characterized in that it

<CLAIMS>
A box-like container construction, 
particularly for packaging products, characterized in 

that it comprises two half-shells, each of which is 
formed of a die-cut sheet material, and has a concave 

configuration on a side thereof, defined by bending 
peripheral portions thereof, said two half-shells 

being provided with at least a pair of closure tabs 
which extend laterally, from opposite portions, 

toward the second of said two half-shells, and 
engaging with slots defined on the side surface of 

the second half-shell. 
A box-like container, according to Claim 
1, characterized in that each of said two half-shells 

comprises a die-cut sheet element, having a 
substantially rectangular central portion and four 

substantially rectangular peripheral portions, each 
of said peripheral portions being connected to said 

central portion by a bending line coinciding with a 
side of said central portion, isosceles trapezoid 

corner portions being further provided which are 
connected, with a slanted side thereof, to one of 

said peripheral portions through a bending line and 
being provided, on the other slanted side thereof, 

 
with a restraining tab associated with the adjoining 

peripheral portion, said peripheral portions and said 
corner portions being bent in the direction of a same 

face of said central portion. 
A box-like container, according to the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said closure 

tabs extend from the peripheral portions arranged on 
the sides of the first half-shell. 
A box-like container, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said slots are formed along the bending line 
connecting the two peripheral portions with the sides 

of the second half-shell. 
A box-like container, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said closure tabs are provided, on the portion 
thereof engageable in said slots, with anti-disengaging 

tabs. 
A box-like container, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that the peripheral portions of said second 
half-shell, affected by said closure tabs, are 

provided, on a side thereof facing the opposite 
portion of said central portion, with locating 

 
recesses for said closure tabs. 
A box-like container, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that the peripherical portions of said half-shell, 
provided with said closure tabs, are provided with 

locating tabs engaging, as said half-shells are 
superimposed onto one another, in locating recesses 

correspondingly defined on the peripheral portions of 
the second half-shell. 
A box-like container, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said half-shell is provided, on the convex side 
thereof, with a strip-like handle, coupled to the 

central portion of the second half-shell. 
A box-like container, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said closure tabs are made in a single-piece 
with the first half-shell. 
A box-like container, according to one 
or more of the preceding claims, characterized in 

that said half-shells are made of a paper material.
