<ABSTRACT>
A cutting apparatus is provided, in which a recording laser 
beam from a laser light source (1) is ON/OFF-modulated by an optical 

modulating device (8) on the basis of a square output signal in which 
a video FM wave signal is pulse width modulated by an audio FM 

wave signal thereby to form exposure pits on a master disc (15,16). This 
cutting apparatus includes a photodetector (38) for receiving one 

portion of the recording laser beam irradiated on the master disc (15,16) 
from the laser light source (1) or a photodetector (38a) for receiving a 

reflected light of the recording laser beam irradiated on the 
master disc from the laser light source (1) and which is reflected on 

the master disc (15,16). A detected output signal from the photodetector (38,38a) 
is supplied through a low-pass filter (39,39a) to a control circuit which 

controls an intensity of an output laser beam from the laser 
light source (1)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to cutting apparatus
for an optical disc and more particularly to a cutting apparatus
for an optical disc in which a master disc of a video disc is
provided by using a laser light source.Video and audio signals are recorded on a prior-art video
disc as shown by a frequency allocation of Fig. 1.As shown in Fig. 1, a video signal and a 2-channel audio
signal are modulated to provide FM signals by FM modulators (not
shown). More specifically, the video signal is FM-modulated to
provide a video FM carrier signal 30 having a central frequency
of 8.5 MHz (frequency deviation is 1.7 MHz), and the stereo 2-channel
audio signal is FM-modulated to provide a first channel
audio FM carrier signal having a central frequency of 2.3 MHz and
a second channel audio FM signal (referred to hereinafter as an
analog audio signal) 31 having a central frequency of 2.8 MHz
(frequency deviation is in a range of Â± 100 kHz). Further, the
2-channel audio signal is pulse code modulated (PCM-modulated) by
16 bits to provide an eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM)-coded
digital audio signal 33. This digital audio signal 33 is
inserted into the low band region lower than 2 MHz as shown in
Fig. 1.Fig. 2 shows a systematic block diagram of a prior-art
cutting apparatus in which the above-mentioned video and audio
signals are recorded on a photoresist coated on a glass master
disc.Referring to Fig. 2, a video signal to be recorded is
recorded by a video tape recorder (i.e., VTR) 35 and the audio 
signal is recorded by a tape recorder 36 or the like in a similar
fashion. The video signal is supplied from the VTR 35 through a
switch 28 to a video modulator 25 provided within a video signal
processing circuit, in which it is FM-modulated. The first 2-channel
audio signal is also supplied from the tape recorder 36
through a switch 29 to an audio modulator 26 provided within an
audio processing circuit, thereby being FM-modulated. The video
FM-modulated wave from the video modulator 25 and the audio FM-modulated
wave from the audio modulator 26 are supplied to a
mixing circuit 24.A second audio signal is recorded by a tape recorder 37 and
is supplied through a switch 34 to an analog-to-digital (A/D)
converter (not shown), in which it is converted into a digial
audio signal. This digital audio signal is pulse code modulated
(PCM-modulated) by an EFM encoder 27, filtered out in its band
higher than 2 MHz by a low-pass filter (not shown), pre-emphasized
in its low band by a pre-emphasizing circuit (not
shown)
