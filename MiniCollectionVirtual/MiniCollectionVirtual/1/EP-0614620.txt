<ABSTRACT>
An extruded filtration material which is degradable 
and comprises either a plastics material or an inorganic 

material having a melting point above the operating 
temperature, a polysaccharide expansion medium, a binder 

and water. These ingredients are fed to an extruder (17) and 
subjected to an extrusion process which involves a 

pressure reduction, upon extrusion from the exit die, of 
up to about 70 bars so that swelling of the extrudate 

occurs to give a cellular structure. 
When exposed to the natural weather conditions, 
tobacco smoke filter elements comprising such material 

degrade without leaving a fused amalgamation of plastics 
or inorganic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to filters and filtration
material, and in particular, but not exclusively to tobacco
smoke filters, and methods of producing same.Numerous methods of making filtration material have been
proposed. One method previously proposed by the Applicant was
disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 2 205 102A,
wherein a particulate plastics material, a polysaccharide,
optionally a binder, and water are fed to an extruder which is
operated under such heat and pressure conditions that upon
emergence from the extruder die, the extrudate assumes a
cross-section greater than that of the exit orifice of the
die. The expanded product may be fed to the garniture of a
cigarette filter making machine or shredded and then gathered
and formed into a cigarette filter in a garniture of a
cigarette filter making machine. A disadvantage with the
product obtained by following the teaching in this document
was that, although the product was considerably expanded, it
was not very suitable for standard filter making product
because at low moisture contents the product could be friable
and brittle. Thus, the use of such product on a filter
tipping machine, where the filter element is rolled to
interattach same to the tobacco rod, would be likely to result
in the physical breakage thereof. Furthermore, it has been
found that polypropylene, and other plastics materials having
similar melting points, fuse with itself and/or the
polysaccharide expansion medium and will not break down if 
left in the physical environment without leaving a fused
amalgamation of plastics material.The present invention has as an object the provision of
processes for producing a filtration product which is
particularly suitable for filtering tobacco smoke and which is
degradable, especially under the weather conditions of the
natural environment.It is a further object of the present invention to
provide a filtration product which has physical
characteristics which are suitable for the manufacture of
tobacco smoke filtration elements and filter tipped
cigarettes, and which is degradable, especially under the
weather conditions of the natural environment.The weather conditions of the natural environment were
simulated using a Q.U.V. Weathering Tester (Horizontal Option)
made by the Q - Panel Company. This machine reproduces the
damage caused by sunlight, rain and dew on materials placed
outdoors. Filters according to the present invention and
control conventional filter elements of cellulose acetate and
paper were tested by exposing

material, 1-100% water-soluble polysaccharide expansion

extruded filtration material, and water, said extruded

filtration material having a cellular structure as a
result of vaporisation to steam of at least a portion of

said water upon extrusion of said material, and said
