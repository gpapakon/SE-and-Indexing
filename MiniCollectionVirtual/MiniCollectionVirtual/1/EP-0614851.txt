<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a speed coupling head for a container 
containing a beverage under pressure of the type comprising a stop-tap 

(3) of the beverages located on a delivery line (4) and having a mobile 
valve (2) in a complementary seating (20), as well as stop means (30) 

for the entry of the gas coming from the supply line (14), and further 
having a lever (8) with two manually-achieved stable positions freeable 

for the passage from one position to the other of the said stable 
positions. The head (5) comprises a command element (16) of the valve 

(2) and a transmission shaft (15) interconnected with the lever (8) in 
such a way as to shift it automatically on the activating of the lever 

(8), correlating the intercepting of the drink delivery line (4) with 
the position of the lever (8) in which the stop means (30) prevent the 

gas from acceeding to the head (5) and vice versa.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rapid connection head 
for drinks containers, having a delivery line for 
beverages and a gas supply line, for drinks 
dispenser plants. The said head is of the type 
comprising a stop-tap of the beverages located on 
a delivery line and having a mobile choke-valve in 
a complementary seating, as well as stop means 
for the entry of the gas coming from the supply 
line, and further having a lever with two 
manually-achieved stable positions freeable for 
the passage from one position to the other of the 
said stable positions. The prior art embraces connection heeds, 
particularly used in drinks dispensing plants, 
which are structured in such a way as to permit 
the rapid substitution of the containers or kegs 
of beverages which become empty during the plant's 
use. The said heads also permit the immediate 
reconnection of the delivery lines of the beverage 
and the supply line of the carbon dioxide which,  
 
normally, is added to the beverage to produce 
effervescence and the characteristic foamy head. The activation of the lever of the above stop 
means has the aim of moving, internally to the 
head, a mobile element which permits of 
intercepting the gas inlet mouth before the 
detachment of the head from the drinks container, 
thus preventing the gas' exit into the atmosphere 
during all of the time necessary to effect the 
substitution of the drinks container. The stop tap of the feed lines, which is 
associated to the head, has the aim of avoiding 
the return of the drink which has already been 
sent to the delivery line, in order to avoid the 
emptying of the relative pipe. All of the prior art devices envisage that the 
stop tap is closed by means of a manual operation 
before the detachment of the head, the said manual 
operation being performed independently of the 
activating of the lever stopping the gas access to 
the head. The fundamental disadvantage of the above 
solutions is represented by the fact that the 
substitution of the empty containers is performed 
without drawbacks only if a precise sequence of  
 
determined operations is performed, as follows: 
closure of the delivery tap of the drink; closure of the gas supply line; substitution of the empty container; connection of the container head; reopening of the gas line; reopening of the drinks delivery tap. If this sequence is not respected, a series of 
drawbacks arise, the most important of which is 
represented by the emptying of the drinks delivery 
line and/or the failure of the dispensing plant

<CLAIMS>
A rapid connection head for drinks containers, 
having a delivery line for beverages and a gas 

supply line, for drinks dispenser plants, of the 
type comprising a drinks stop tap (3) located on 

the said delivery line (4) and having a mobile 
valve (2) in a complementary seating (20); stop 

mans (30) of the entry of gas coming from a 
supply line (14), having a lever (8) with two 

stable positions, manually freeable for passing 
from one position to another of the said 

positions; the said head being characterised in 
that it comprises a command element (16) of the 

said valve (2) and a transmission shaft (15) 
interconnected, at two opposite ends (151, 152) of 

the said shaft (15), to the said command element 
(16) and to the said lever (8), the said 

transmission shaft (15) automatically moving the 
said valve (2) in a valve seating (20) on the 

activating of the said lever (8), correlating an 
intercepting of the delivery line (4) of the drink 

with a position of the said lever (8) in which the 
 

said stop means (30) prevent the gas from 
acceeding to the head (5) and vice-versa. 
A head as in claim 1, wherein the said valve (2) 
and the said complementary seating (20) are 

rotoidally associated, characterised in that the 
said transmission shaft (15) and the said command 

element (16) of the valve (2) are mutually 
interconnected at respective first hinged ends 

(151, 152), having respective second ends (152, 
162) interconnected one rotoidally to the said 

lever (8) and the other solidly to the said valve 
(2). 
A head as in claim 1, wherein the said valve (2) 
and the said complementary seating (20) are 

rotoidally associated, characterised in that the 
said command element (16) is rotatably 

oscillatingly supported by the said head (5), with 
the said command element (16) rotatably 

interconnecting with the said transmission shaft 
(15) at a first hinged end (161), exhibiting at a 

second opposite end (162) a rack (18) meshing with 
a cogged wheel (19) solid with the said valve (2), 

in such a way as to correlate the rotation of the 
 

said command element (16) with respect to the said 
seating (20) with the movement of the said lever 

(8). 
A head as in claim 1, wherein the said valve (2) 
is slidably associated to the said complementary 

seating (20) characterised by the fact that the 
said command element (16) is elastically checked

position in which the said tap (3) is open, the 

said transmission shaft (15), solidly 
interconnected with the said lever (8) at the said 

second end (152), being associated to the said 
command element (16) by means of the said first

said lever (8), the said transmission shaft (15) 

and the said command element (16) are reciprocally 
interconnected in an articulated quadrilateral

(2) a movement with respect to the said seating 

(20) which movement is correlated with the 
 

movement of the said lever (8).
