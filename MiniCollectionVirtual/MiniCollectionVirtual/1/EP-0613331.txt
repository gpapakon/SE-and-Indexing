<ABSTRACT>
Hybrid circuits are usually attached with contact pins (combs) onto the corresponding printed circuit boards by being placed in a dip-solder bath. Surface-mount components are in addition soldered onto the printed circuit board in an oven. Two soldering steps are necessary for this purpose. The method according to the invention provides an improvement in this regard, in that through-contact bores (B) are made on the support substrate of the hybrid circuit (H). These are placed on soldering surfaces of the printed circuit board (L) which are provided with solder paste and the entire arrangement is soldered in an oven.

Method of securing a hybrid circuit on a printed 
circuit board, which is connected to the carrier 

substrate (TS) of the hybrid circuit (H) by means of a 
soldered joint which forms an electrical contact, electrical 

components being arranged on the surface of the 
carrier substrate (TS) and the carrier substrate (TS) 

being provided with plated-through holes (B), characterized 

in that the plated-through holes (B) are arranged at such 
a short distance from one another that shear forces, 

occurring after soldering during the cooling-down 
process, between the carrier substrate (TS) and the 

printed circuit board (L), which are composed of 
different materials, are absorbed, 
in that soldering areas for making electrical contact 
with the hybrid circuit are provided on the printed 

circuit board (L), 
in that a solder paste is applied to the soldering areas 
of the printed circuit board (L), and the carrier 

substrate (TS) of the hybrid circuit having the plated-through 
holes (B) is placed onto the soldering areas of 

the printed circuit board (L), and 
in that the entire arrangement is soldered in a furnace. 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterized
 
in that when there is an integrated circuit (IC) on the 

carrier substrate (TS), the plated-through holes (B) are 
provided at the end of the terminals of the integrated 

circuit (IC).  
 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized
 
in that one of the components is a printed resistor 

network or a capacitor network. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized
 
in that a capacitor network comprising at least one 

capacitor is provided on the printed circuit board (L). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized
 
in that the holes (B) are provided as semicircular holes 

in the region of the side edges of the carrier substrate 
(TS). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized
 
in that the plated-through holes (B) are arranged in a 

circular geometry relative to one another on the carrier 
substrate (TS). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized
 
in that the plated-through holes (B) are arranged in a 

rectangular geometry relative to one another on the 
carrier substrate (TS).
