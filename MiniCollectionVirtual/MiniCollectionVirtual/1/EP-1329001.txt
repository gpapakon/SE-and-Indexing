<ABSTRACT>
An antenna system (10) capable of transmitting electromagnetic radiation using the technique of combining two quadrature signals for either right hand circular polarization or left hand circular polarization using a circularly polarized antenna (30), or alternately, either horizontal or vertical polarization using a linearly polarized antenna (36) while incorporating feedback for automatically correcting for amplitude and phase variations in the quadrature paths using a switch (12) which selects the sense of the polarization and electronic optimization of the transmit antenna (30, 36). The antenna system includes a control circuit having a polarization switch (12) for receiving a transmission signal. The switch (12) generates first and second output signals which are substantially similar to the transmission signal, and determines whether to apply the transmission signal to one of a first or a second switch output. A coupler (14) receives the first and second switch outputs and generates first and second output signals having a predetermined phase difference. A variable detector (16, 18) detects and adjusts a relative amplitude and phase of the respective first and second output signals. An error correction circuit (34) determines an adjustment to the variable phase detector to vary the phase and amplitude of the first and second output signals in accordance with the relative amplitude and phase of the respective first and second output signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antenna system capable of transmitting
electromagnetic radiation and, more particularly, to microwave transmitters
associated with an antenna which allows the user to select antenna polarization.It is known in the radio frequency (RF) field that feeding two linearly polarized
antenna elements with quadrature signals yields circular polarization. It is also known
that operating on the relative phase of each of these signals changes the sense of the
circular polarization. This technique is generally limited to radar and jamming
applications where the amount of cross-polarization signal is less important.
However, in the field of communications, dual polarization is often used to increase
the number of independent signals that can share a common spectrum. Therefore,
for communication applications, it becomes critical to minimize the level of the cross-polarized
signal to facilitate the maximum number of independent signals.The conventional method for generating high quality switchable dual
polarization is to use an antenna with two input ports, one for each of the desired
polarizations. An RF switch is then used to connect to the appropriate input port of
the antenna, thus allowing selection of the desired polarization. Also, in order to meet
the output power requirements of many implementations, several amplifiers must be
used. As a result, one or more couplers are required for combining the outputs of
multiple amplifiers. One must also keep in mind that the RF switch which is selected
must be capable of switching the full output power of these amplifiers. In light of this,
it is desirable to eliminate the need for high power switching and couplers, reducing
the amplification required to overcome the losses inherent in these devices. Finally, it
is desirable to alternately utilize a quadrature coupler for recombining quadrature
signals, allowing application to linearly polarized antenna systems. US 4,710,734 discloses two examples of microwave polarization control
networks. The first produces two sets of orthogonal linear polarizations and
constitutes a two position transfer switch and a directional coupler having two ports
alternating as input and isolated ports and two ports alternating as through and
coupled output ports. The transfer switch is connected to switch an input to one or
the other of the two ports alternating as input and isolated ports and couple the other
to a termination. An ortho-mode transducer junction, having two input ports, has one
input port coupled
