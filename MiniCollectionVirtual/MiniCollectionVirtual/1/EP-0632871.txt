<ABSTRACT>
A secondarily contained underground piping system which interconnects at least one underground storage tank (TS1, TS2, TS3) dispensing pump to at least one above-ground dispensing unit. The system includes an originating chamber surrounding the dispensing pump and having at least one opening therein for pipe access thereto. A terminating chamber (CT2) is positioned directly under the above-ground dispensing unit and includes at least one opening therein for pipe access thereto. A transfer pipe (P1, P2) is operably connected from the dispensing pump to the above-ground dispensing unit, and passes through the openings in the originating chamber and the opening in the terminating chamber (CT2). Seals are provided for sealing the passage of the transfer pipe (P1, P2) through the openings. The transfer pipe (P1, P2) includes an inner primary supply pipe for transferring fuel and an outer secondary containment pipe for defining an interstitial space between the primary pipe and the containment pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a secondarily contained
piping system according to the preamble of claim 1. In recent years there has been an increased
awareness that the underground storage and distribution
systems of hazardous fluids, such as hydrocarbon fuels
and a diversity of chemicals, need to be improved to
prevent any product leaking from these systems from
escaping into the environment and contaminating the
underground drinking water. Both public health and fire
safety regulatory bodies have imposed strict guidelines
and regulations on such systems to insure public safety.Leaking underground storage tanks and their
associated underground piping systems became the focus of
the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which
initiated federal and state legislation that would
require an improved means of storage, distribution, leak
detection and accounting of all stored fluids which are
deemed to be hazardous. The EPA conducted studies which
showed that underground piping failures were caused by
poor installation practices, corrosion and structural
failure, and these factors were responsible for most of
the leaks reported.In response to this public awareness and concern,
equipment specifiers and manufacturers have developed
improved piping systems in recent years to provide a
greater degree of protection around the primary fluid 
supply piping, commonly referred to as "secondary
containment".In addition to the regulatory bodies mentioned
above, facility owners and their insurance companies have
become very concerned with the type of materials used and
the design specifications of existing, new and proposed
fuel storage, transmission and dispensing equipment. An
important area of concern is the chemical compatibility
of the materials used in the construction of both the
primary and secondary containment systems. As a result,
Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL), a nationally
recognized and accepted independent testing laboratory,
has already established and proposed new standards for
both the primary and secondary containment underground
storage, transmission and dispensing equipment.
Acceptable materials for use in this application
generally relate to the material's stability when exposed
to conditions and chemicals additives, as well as other
chemicals being stored and dispensed. In addition,
another area of concern is the ability of a material to
provide an acceptable containment barrier for the product
to be stored. The product permeability rating of a
material is generally accepted by

A secondarily contained piping system comprising:

an originating chamber (167) enclosing a dispensing
pump (171) on a storage tank (169) and having at least

one opening therein for pipe access thereto,
a terminating chamber (187A) positioned under a dispensing
unit (53) and having at least one opening therein

for pipe access thereto,
a flexible transfer pipe (87) operably connected to
said dispensing pump (171) and said dispensing unit

(53), said transfer pipe (87) passing through an opening
in said originating chamber (167) and an opening in said

terminating chamber (187A),

characterized in that

the transfer pipe (87) comprises a flexible inner
primary supply pipe (80) for transferring fluid, said

inner supply pipe comprising an inner barrier layer
(83), a fiber reinforcement layer (85) and an outer

damage protection layer (81), and
a flexible outer secondary containment pipe (91)
spaced from the inner supply pipe (97) by a plurality of

circumferentially spaced ribs (93) extending radially
from one of the inner or outer pipe, said ribs (93) each

having a surface confronting and engaging the other of
the inner or outer pipe,
said ribs creating an interstitial space (95) between 
the inner and outer pipes
, and said ribs having a
predetermined configuration in a longitudinal direction

for the migration of fluid in the interstitial space
(95) between the inner and outer pipes.
The piping system of claim 1, wherein the ribs (93)
undulate in both the circumferential and axial directions

to permit fluid flow in all directions between the
outer pipe (91) and the inner pipe (97) in the interstitial

space (95).
The piping system of claim 1, further characterized by
a monitoring unit (17) for detecting leaks anywhere in

the system.
The piping system of claim 3, wherein the monitoring
unit (17) comprises a liquid level detection system.
The piping system of claims 3 or 4, further characterized
by a plurality of level detectors (61A,61B,61C) for

detecting the amount of fluid contained in the interstitial
space relative to a fixed point on a chamber

(11), and
an alarm (63) operably connected to a supply pump

(13) that shuts down the fluid supply pump (13) in the
system when a leak is detected.
The piping system of claim 3, wherein the monitoring
unit (17) is connected to the interstitial space (95) in

the pipe system via a tube (19) and connecting boot
(21).
The piping system of claim 1, further characterized by 
at least one pair of boots (43,43A) and a tube (44)

enabling connection of the interstitial space (95) of
one pipe segment (23) to the interstitial space of a

next pipe segment (41).
The piping system of claim 7 wherein boots (43,43A) have
one end snugly fitted to the outside of the outer secondary

containment pipe (65) by a fastening strap (75)
and the other end snugly fastened to the inner pipe (64)

by a fastening strap (77),

   and wherein the tube (44,73) is connected to the elbow
fitting (71) of each boot (43,43A) to connect the

interstitial space of the first and second pipe segments
(23,41).
