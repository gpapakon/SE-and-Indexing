<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide an 
ink, and ink jet recording method and apparatus using 

the ink which has excellent dispersion stability, 
discharge stability and recovery properties, and which 

can be kept in the weak alkali region even if it 
contains carbon black with low pH, which is generally 

considered to be difficult to handle and which can 
obtain a high-density image. The ink contains acid 

carbon black having a volatile content within the range 
of 3.5 to 8 % by weight, and a water-soluble resin 

having a weight average molecular weight within the 
range of 3,000 to 30,000, both of which are dissolved in 

an aqueous liquid medium, and a compound represented by 
the following formula (I), wherein the ratio by weight 

between the acid carbon black and the water-soluble 
resin is within the range of 3 : 1 to 10 : 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an ink,
particularly to a pigment ink for ink jet
recording.An ink jet recording system has the advantages that
less noise occurs in recording, and that a recorded
image with high resolution can be obtained at a high
speed by using a highly-integrated head.Such an ink jet recording system uses as an ink a
solution obtained by dissolving a water-soluble dye in
water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent.
However, the use of the water-soluble dye frequently
causes the recorded image to have low light resistance
because of the poor light resistance of the water-soluble
dye, and the low water resistance, because of
the water-solubility of the ink. Namely, when the
recorded image is exposed to rain, sweat or drinking 
water, the recorded image is sometimes blurred or
disappears.In order to improve fastness, investigations to
find a water-soluble pigment ink having excellent water
resistance and light resistance had been made.
Particularly, acid carbon having low volatile content
and pH, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 3-210373,
had been investigated because the use of such
carbon produces images having high density regardless of
the type of the paper used.However, since such acid carbon exhibits dispersion
stability which is far worse than that of conventional
basic carbon, the selecting on the type, amount and acid
value of the dispersant, and the neutralizer (alkali
substance) for neutralizing the dispersant used are
strictly limited. In addition, even inks formed by
using the selected materials face rapid increases in the
viscosity of the ink and pigment agglomeration and
deposition due to evaporation of only a small amount of
water. In other words, in order to satisfy various
properties of the ink containing acid carbon, such as
the dispersion stability, discharge stability, recovery
properties, pH maintenance, at least a weak alkali
humectant having chemical stability must be added. In
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,173,112 and 5,250,109, an amide of 
polyoxyalkyamine, a sulfonamide, urea or a thiourea
derivative is added to a dye or pigment ink in order to
improve clogging and preservation stability. However,
as described above, only a narrow range of permissible
substances can be combined with acid carbon, and
sufficient reliability cannot be obtained by these
substances.Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-55552 discloses
various humectants for dye ink. However, in this
specification, the amounts of the dispersant and
humectant used in an ink
