<ABSTRACT>
A direct access storage device (DASD) system uses a read/write head 
having a wide transducer write element (110) and a narrow 

magneto-resistive 
read element (112). In order to avoid mistakenly reading a incompletely 

erased 
old data field (202), the system uses a verification procedure. The 

data is 
read at two positions along the data track which are separated by a 

radial distance D. This distance D is selected to be greater than the 
width of any incompletely erased data record. If the data read at the 

two read positions is equal, then the data is deemed to be correct and is 
sent to a host system 70.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data storage system having a 
wide write element and a narrow read element. Direct access storage devices (DASD) or disk drives, store 
information on concentric tracks of a rotatable magnetic recording disk. 
A read/write head is moved from track to track in order to read and 
record the desired information. Typically, the head is positioned on an 
air bearing slider which flies above the surface of the disk as the disk 
rotates. In some disk drives, the slider rides on a liquid film or 
bearing on the disk. A head suspension assembly connects the slider to a 
rotary or linear actuator which moves the head to different radial 
positions along the disk. During operation of the DASD units, it is important that the head 
stays positioned over the center of the track on which it is writing or 
reading data. This has become increasingly difficult as the tracks have 
become smaller in width and are spaced closer together in order to 
increase the overall data density of the DASD. The head may be off 
centre due to differences in thermal expansion of the different parts of 
the DASD, inaccuracies in the head position actuator, imperfect axial 
rotation of the spindle motor which rotates the disk, or any of a number 
of other factors. One solution to the head mispositioning problem is to move the head 
in incremental steps across the track and try to determine the actual 
centre of the track. The references which discuss this include 
US4,485,418 issued November 27, 1984; European Patent Application 0220382 
published June 5, 1987; IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 35, 
No.4B, p.303, Sept. 1992; IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol.29, 
No.2, p.586, July 1986. Incomplete erasure of a previously recorded data track is another 
problem which occurs due to mispositioning of the head. When a new data 
field is written on a track, it overwrites the previous old data field. 
However, if the head is not properly centreed on the track, then a slice  
 
of the old data may remain at the edge of the new data field. This may 
cause errors in reading. One approach to solving this problem has been to provide erase 
bands between the data tracks. The head may have additional separate 
erase elements on either side of the write element in order to insure 
that the edge of each newly written field does not contain any data. 
Alternatively, the write element may be used to create the erase bands on 
either side of a newly written data field. Examples of this include US
