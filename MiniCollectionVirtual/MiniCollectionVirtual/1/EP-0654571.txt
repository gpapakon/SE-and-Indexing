<ABSTRACT>
The method comprises the steps of: 
erecting trussed column assemblies (1A, 1B) 

which are constructed by arranging and joining 
a plurality of struts, beams and braces; 

installing trussed beam assemblies (1C) between 
the tops of the trussed column assemblies 

(1A, 1B) which have been erected in parallel 
with each other, to form a portal truss 

assembly (1D); mounting portal truss assemblies 
(1D) lengthwise and breadthwise in conformity 

with a configuration of a steel structure 
being built; and carrying a first module 

(6A) into a construction zone, which module 
being among modules being mounted in the 

construction zones between the oppositely arranged 
portal truss assemblies (1D) and being 

to be arranged at a position higher than 
those for the other modules, lifting the first 

module (6A) above a second module (6B), 
which is to be arranged immediately below 

the first module (6A), by means of a first lifting 
device provided on the sides of the portal 

truss assemblies 1D, carrying in the second 
module (6B) immediately below the first module 

(6A), joining the both modules (6A, 6B), 
further carrying in third modules (6C) below 

the second module (6B) and joining the both 
modules (6B, 6C), and repeating the above sequences 

to mount the modules (6A, 6B, 6C, 
---) between the portal truss assemblies (1D).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a module construction
method in a steel structure building zone, which can be applied
to the assembly and construction of steel buildings and the assembly
and installation of power generating sets, steel making
machines, or paper making machines, or apparatuses and equipment
for chemical plants etc. which are installed in the buildings.The module construction methods in a steel structure
building zone shown in FIGS. 26 and 27 have so far been used.The method shown in FIG. 26 is called a pile-up method,
in which a member 021 forming a steel building 02 or an apparatus
03 to be installed in the steel building is lifted and
transported for installation and assembly as a single item or a
block forming a certain small section by using a crane 01 installed
on the ground.The method shown in FIG. 27 is called a push-up method
in which after a roof 06 and a top floor 07 are completed, they
are raised (jacked up) by using hydraulic equipment etc. to
produce a space for installing the next floor under the top
floor 07, the next floor to be connected to the top floor 07 is
built in this space, the roof 06 and the top floor 07 is lowered
(jacked down) to incorporate with the lower floor, and the
incorporated structure is jacked up to produce a space for installing
the next floor under the incorporated structure, thus
the building structure is assembled successively.In FIG. 27, reference numeral 08 denotes an external
protective cover, 09 denotes a material carrying unit, and 010
denotes a slide strut. 
(1) With the above-described pile-up method, the weight
and size of a single item of apparatus or a block formed by incorporating
the items are limited by the crane capacity such as
working radius, lifting capacity, lifting height, and lift, so
that the work efficiency is decreased. When the building and
the apparatus to be installed in the building are assembled
separately, it is necessary to provide an upper or a side space
for transportation to the place where the apparatus is installed.
Therefore, the term of works is extended due to the
adjustment of the work schedule or the work progress and for
other reasons.
Even when there is no limit of crane capacity and the
building and the apparatus to be installed in the building can
be assembled as a block, the next step cannot sometime be performed
because of the relationship between the floors.(2) With the above-described push-up method, the next
step cannot be performed before the entire floor is completed.
For example, if a trouble

Module construction method in a steel structure building
zone applicable to the construction of a steel structure or

steel building, comprising the steps of:

erecting truss column assemblies (1A, 1B) formed by arranging
and joining a plurality of pillars;
installing a truss beam assembly (1C) between the tops of
said two truss column assemblies (1A, 1B) erected in parallel

to construct a gate-shaped truss assembly (1D);
installing gate-shaped truss assemblies (1D) in opposition
to fit in with the planar shape of said steel structure to

be constructed; and
installing modules (12) in the construction zone formed
between said gate-shaped truss assemblies (1D) by repeating a

process in which, among modules to be installed in the construction
zone formed between gate-shaped truss assemblies, a

first module (12) to be located at a high place is lifted to
the required height by using a first elevating device (3,4) installed

at the upper part at the side of a gate-shaped truss
assembly, and a second module is carried in just below the

first module to integrate both modules.
Module construction method in a steel structure building
zone according to claim 1, wherein is added after the step

of installing gate-shaped truss assemblies in opposition the
step of:


lifting permanent support beams (20) between gate-shaped
truss assemblies (1D) arranged in opposition by using the first 

elevating devices (3, 4) installed at the upper part at the
side of the gate-shaped tr
uss assemblies (1D), and joining both
ends of the permanent support beam (20) to the sides of the

beam truss assemblies (1C).
Module construction method in a steel structure building
zone according to claim 1 or 2, wherein a step is added in

which structure blocks (6A, 6B, 6C) are installed in the construction
zone under a gate-shaped truss assembly (1D) by repeating

a process in which, among structure blocks to be housed
in the construction zone formed under a gate-shaped truss assembly,

a first structure block (6A) to be located at a high
place is lifted to the required height by using said first elevating

device (3,4), and a second structure block (6B) is carried
in just below the first structure block (6A) to integrate

both blocks.
Module construction method in a steel structure building
zone according to claim 3, wherein a step is added in which

after one of said modules (12) or structure blocks (6A, 6B,
6C), which are manufactured in advance so that their heights

are equal to each other, is installed into the construction
zone, then the other (module or structure block) is joined

with beams and horizontal braces (11) to install into the
same floor.
Module construction method in a steel structure building
zone according to claim 3, wherein the step for installing

modules (12) in the construction zone and the step for installing
