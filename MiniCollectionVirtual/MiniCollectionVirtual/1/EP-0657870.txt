<ABSTRACT>
In the sound absorbing member (1), partition members (5) each 
formed of sound absorbing material are disposed between 

first and second light transmissive sheet members (2, 3) to 
thereby form a plurality of small spaces, and first and 

second through holes (2a, 3a) are formed in the first and second 
sheet members (2, 3), respectively, in such manner that the 

first through holes communicate with other small spaces 
than the small spaces in communication with the second 

through holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sound
absorbing member having a light transmissive property.Conventionally, sound absorbing members such as
a plastic foaming member formed in a fiber mat or including
communication pores have been often used in the ceiling,
walls, and the like for a building. These sound absorbing
members are required by no means to have a light
transmissive property and thus most of them do not have the
light transmissive property.In recent years, as a ceiling member or a wall
member for a certain type of building having a membrane
structure or as a composite material with a lighting window
used in a factory, there has been demanded a sound
absorbing member which has a light transmissive property.
However, conventionally, there has not been developed this
type of sound absorbing member. Quite lately, a sound
absorbing member using a glass fiber mat has been available
on the market. However, it has only such a light
transmittance of 25% or less that an image cannot be seen
through the member.The sound absorbing property of a sound absorbing
material is determined by the following conditions: That 
is, (1) the flow resistance within the material, (2) the
porosity of the material, (3) the thickness of the
material, (4) the background conditions, and the like.
When a sound wave enters the surface of the material, then
it travels through the air in gaps within the material into
the interior of the material. At that time, part of the
sound energy is converted to heat energy due to the viscous
friction of the air to thereby absorb a sound energy. At
the same time, sound absorption is also produced due to
heat conduction between the air in the slight gaps of the
material and the slight gap walls. Therefore, in order to
obtain a certain degree of sound absorption, the density of
the material must be increased and the diameter of a fiber
must be decreased. As a result, even if a transparent
glass fiber is used, the light transmissive property of the
glass fiber is lost, which results in the low light
transmittance.WO 85/02640 discloses a sound barrier formed by an outer wall
and an inner wall made of transparent plastic, with acoustic
resonators concealed in a frame holding both walls.The present invention has been made to eliminate
the above drawbacks found in the conventional sound
absorbing member. Accordingly, it is an object of the
invention to provide a sound absorbing member which has not
only a sound absorbing property but also a light
transmissive property. After having carefully

<CLAIMS>
A light transmissive sound absorbing member (1),
comprising:


a first sheet member (2) having a light transmissive
property and including a plurality of through holes (2a);
a second sheet member (3) so disposed as to form a space (4)
between said first sheet member and said second sheet

member, said second sheet member having a light
transmissive property and including a plurality of through

holes (3a); and
partition members (5) interposed between said first and
second sheet members to divide said space into a plurality

sheet member (2) are so positioned as to communicate with a

first group of said small spaces (4a) other than a second group
of said small spaces (4b) that are in communication with said

through holes (3a) formed in said second sheet member (3).

claimed in claim 1, wherein said first and second sheet 

members are provided with projections (2b,3b) for fixing said
partition members.
