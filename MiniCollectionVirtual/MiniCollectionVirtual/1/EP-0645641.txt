<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
magnets.Magnetic resonance imaging requires that an object to be
imaged is placed in a magnetic field homogeneous to a few tens of
parts per million. High magnetic fields (≥ .5 T) are typically
produced in cylindrical super conducting electro-magnets. For
lower fields (≤ .3 T) a permanent magnet or a 'resistive' electromagnet
is sufficient. The present invention is concerned more
especially with these latter kinds of magnet having opposing pole
pieces, such as the so called 'H' and 'C' magnets, wherein an
imaging volume is defined between the opposing pole pieces.As is well known to those skilled in the art the imaging
process requires that linear magnetic field gradients are pulsed on
and off to provide spatial frequency and phase encoding which is
necessary to generate an image. These linear magnetic field
gradients are generated by gradient coils which are typically an
assembly of electrical conductors, the precise geometry of which
defines the orientation of the magnetic field gradient produced
and when the gradient coils are pulsed current changes of
between 60 to 100 amps are typically produced in 1 msec. One of
the problems with this imaging process is that hysteresis and
eddy current effects are produced in the pole pieces, which can
spoil the stability and or homogeneity of the magnetic field over
the imaging volume and this leads to degradation of image
quality. One known method of reducing these undesirable effects is
to actively shield coils provided to produce the magnetic field
gradients and this is achieved by designing the coils so that they
comprise layers of conductors with currents flowing in opposite
directions so that a magnetic field in pole plates provided on the
opposing pole pieces is as close to zero as possible. This method
usually requires air or water cooling due to increased electrical
power which leads to an increase in the capital and running costs
of a magnet system.An alternative approach is to choose a pole plate material
having low coercivity and low conductivity whereby the
hysteresis and eddy current problem would be substantially
obviated. Hitherto, various materials and types of construction
have been proposed for pole plate construction comprising inter-alia,
the use of ferrites or horizontally disposed Silicon Iron
laminates (i.e. pole plates fabricated of stacked discs of Silicon
Iron which afford lamination in a direction orthogonal to the
longitudinal axis of the pole pieces). Hitherto, all of these
