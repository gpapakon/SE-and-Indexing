<ABSTRACT>
In an electric connecting device, a pair of conductors 
(3) is engaged in respective anchoring seats (3) formed 

in one connecting portion (6) provided with a coupling 
bush (17) to be coaxially engaged by sliding on a guide 

collar (18) associated with a second connecting portion 
(10). Suitable fitting lugs (25, 27) associated with the 

guide collar (18) cooperate with coupling slots (26, 28) 
formed in the bush (17) for mutually fastening the first 

and second connecting portions (6, 10) to an operating 
condition in which the electric connecting elements (11) 

shaped as piercing points and integral with the first 
portion diametrically cross the terminal ends (3a) of 

the conductors (3) housed in the anchoring seats (7) for 
coming into close contact with the conductor cores (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connecting device for
electric components, of the type comprising,
the features defined in the preamble of claim 1.In the embodiment to which reference will be
particularly made in the course of the present
description the connecting device aims at electrically
connecting bulb microlamps, of the type used for signal
lights in electrical apparatus and the like. However it
is understood that the device in question can also be
conceived for uses different from the described one.It is known that connection of electric and/or
electronic components to respective electric conductors
can be presently made following different modalities.According to a first system it is essentially provided
that the electric or electronic component be equipped
with appropriate terminals to which the ends of the
respective conductors are secured by welding, upon
removal of the insulating sheath coating said ends.The execution of this method involves many difficulties
above all with reference to small-sized and mass-produced
electric or electronic components where the 
connection of the wires is required to be carried out in
a completely automated manner and within a very short
period of time.According to another known connecting method, suitable
connectors may be associated with the electric conductor
ends through a mere clasping operation, said connectors
being adapted to be engaged by forced fitting on
corresponding terminals associated with the electric or
electronic component to be connected.This solution has undoubted advantages as compared to
the execution of a welding, but suffers from some
drawbacks too, such as the necessity of carrying out
different workings for removing the insulating sheath
from the conductor ends and fastening the connectors
thereto.It is also to be noted that with the use of the above
described connectors operations for engaging each
conductor to the respective terminal take place
independently of each other. This situation involves
important technical difficulties when in automated
processes such engagement operations must be carried out
simultaneously for the purpose of reducing the working
time.There are also connecting devices enabling the
connection of all conductors associated with an electric
or electronic component to be carried out simultaneously
in a single operation, without requiring removal of the
insulating sheath from the ends of the individual
conductors.These devices essentially comprise one connecting
portion usually made of plastic material in
