<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a comminuting device which processes small 
pieces of bulk materials, such as pieces of rubber tires, into crumb-sized 

particles. It is designed to operate at slow speeds, 50 - 350 rpm by having the 
work material move along the exterior peripheral surface of a 

rotating drum (72) 
cutting efficiencies are improved. This unique invention provides cutting teeth 

on the stator (70) and drum (9) each having limited rotational movement 
which permits 

greater efficiency for cutting multi-grade materials such as rubber tires having 
steel and material cord. Cutting blades can be rotated three times to expose 

unused cutting edges before replacement is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The applicant claims the benefit of the following prior filed copending 
international application designating the United States of America by the same 
sole inventor: International Application No. PCT/US93/01555, International 
Filing Date: February 19, 1993; and United States of America Continuation-in-Part 
Application No. 08/094,543, Filing Date: April 30, 1993. The background of this invention relates to various shredding, tearing, 
cutting and grinding devices which process small pieces of bulk materials, such 
as pieces of rubber tires, into crumb-sized particles. Shredding devices are 
generally known which process large pieces of bulk materials. An early patent issued to Klagsbrunn, U.S. Patent No. 2,546,860, 
teaches a high speed centrifugal mill having a rotating drum having a sieve 
disposed on its peripheral edge with grinding tools disposed in said drum. It 
was used for grinding corn. Each tool disclosed had a three-edged profile and 
a helical pitch which allowed the mill to operate more smoothly because the 
striking surfaces of the centrifugal tool members did not operate along their 
entire length at the same moment. U.S. Patent No. 4,394,983, issued to Ulsky for a tire shredder 
assembly, has a stationary rack in opposition to a rotary cutting assembly. This 
device is specifically for the purpose of reducing tires to small pieces or chunks 
with a minimum production of fines and powdery material. The Ehrlick et al. device, U.S. Patent No. 3,561,303, employs a series 
of reciprocating or oscillating knives which co-act with a stationary anvil to 
shear tire moving across the anvil into diamond-shaped particles. A later 
patent issued to Ehrlick et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,052,013, relates to a tire 
shredding device employing a pair of side-by-side parallel and generally 
cylindrical shredding drums, said drum defined by a series of axially spaced 
apart circular cutting disks. U.S. Patent No. 4,520,963, issued to Grebe et al., discloses a method  
 
for continuously cutting materials such as tires employs a centrifugal technique 
with fast rotating knives. U.S. Patent No. 4,714,201 issued to Rouse et al. teaches an apparatus 
and method for used tire processing including a method for monitoring the 
electrical load on the drum motor to reduce overloads. Reference therein is 
made to a plastics granulator manufactured by the Cumberland Engineering 
Company, a division of Leesona Corporation. Leesona is the assignee of 
numerous U.S. Patents including the following. U.S. Patent Nos.
