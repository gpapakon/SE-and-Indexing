<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a modified polishing pad (62) 
and methods on how to form and used the polishing pad (62). In 

one embodiment, a modified polishing pad (62) is formed similar 
to polishing substrates (14) except that the modifying pressure 

should be large enough to mechanically deform part of the 
polishing pad (62) . The modifying pressure is typically at least 

10 pounds per square inch. The materials used to modify the pad 
should be hard with a smooth surface. Examples of these 

materials are metals, dielectrics, and semiconductors. After 
modifying the polishing pad (62), it may be used to polishing 

semiconductor substrates (14). Compared to a fresh pad, the 
modified polishing pad (62) should be have a higher planarization 

efficiency and be less likely to cause corner rounding of a 
patterned layer (33) adjacent to an opening (39).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor 
devices, and in particular, to polishing pads used in chemical-mechanical 
polishing semiconductor substrates. Planarization of semiconductor substrates is becoming 
more important as the number of layers used to form a 
semiconductor device increases. Nonplanar semiconductor 
substrates have many problems including difficulty in patterning 
a photoresist layer, formation of a void within a film during the 
film deposition, and incomplete removal of a layer during an etch 
process leaving residual portions of the layer, which are 
sometimes called "stringers." A number of planarization 
processes has been developed and include chemical-mechanical 
polishing. FIG. 1 and 2 include illustrations of a part of one type of a 
chemical-mechanical polisher that is used to polish 
semiconductor substrates. FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a 
chemical-mechanical polisher 10. The polisher 10 has a platen 11 
and a polishing pad 12 attached to the platen 11 with an adhesive 
compound (not shown). Above the polishing pad 12 are substrate 
holders 13, and each substrate holder 13 has a semiconductor 
substrate 14. The polisher 10 also includes a polishing slurry and 
a slurry feed, both of which are not shown. The polishing pad 12 
may be made of a porous polyurethane material. FIG. 2 illustrates 
the relative motion of the semiconductor substrates 14 and the 
polishing pad 12. Typically, the polishing pad 12 and 
semiconductor substrates 14 rotate in the same direction. FIG. 2 
illustrates both rotating in a counterclockwise direction, 
although they could both be rotated in a clockwise direction. 
While the rotations occur, the substrates 14 oscillate laterally 
back and forth over a portion of the polishing pad 12. The 
polishing pressure, which is the amount of pressure between the 
substrates 14 and the polishing pad 12 during polishing, is 
typically no greater than about 8 pounds per square inch (about 55  
 
kilopascals). At higher polishing pressures, the substrates 14 
may be fractured during polishing causing the substrates 14 to be 
scrapped. The polishing pad 12 has a plurality of asperities lying at 
the surface of the polishing pad. An asperity is a peak that 
protrudes from the polishing pad, and each asperity has an 
asperity radius and an asperity height. The asperity radius is the 
approximate radius of curvature at the end of an asperity, and the 
asperity height is the distance that the asperity height extends 
from the polishing
