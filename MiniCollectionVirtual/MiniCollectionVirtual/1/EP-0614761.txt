<ABSTRACT>
A dot matrix printer head comprising an ink supply 
tank (2) containing ink absorbing means (61,62), the ink 

supply tank (2) having an ink supply port (41) which is 
arranged to receive ink from the ink absorbing means 

(61,62), characterised in that the ink absorbing means 
(61,62) comprises a plurality of ink absorbing members 

(61,62) arranged so that ink may flow from one to the 
other, the ink absorbing members (61,62) having pores of 

different average diameter such that the average 
diameter of the pores reduces in the direction of the 

ink supply port (41).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink tank and an ink
supply system for supplying a proper amount of inks of
different colors to a printer head.Ink tanks which comprise a bottom wall, a top wall,
walls extending between the top and bottom walls,
an ink supply port in the bottom wall, an ink
supply section filled with an ink absorbing member of a
porous material impregnated with ink, and being formed
as an integral unit detachably mountable to a print head
are known e.g. from JP-A-57 100 088 and EP-A-0 041 777.
However, these ink tanks are not suited for supplying
inks of different colors.In DE-A-3 336 815 an ink-supply system is disclosed
which comprises four separate ink supply sections of
different colors. However, in all prior art documents
space for obtaining and storing ink is completely filled
with ink. Only in case of a maximum filling of the space
the optimum amount of ink needed is provided. In case of
less filling of the space the amount of ink supply may
vary.US-A-4 095 237 also discloses an ink reservoir
comprising a porous filter and an air hole. Though it is
mentioned that the filter may only partially fill the
reservoir US-A-4 095 237 does not teach how to arrange
this filter only partially filling this reservoir. It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a high-quality and highly reliable ink tank
and an ink supply system of a simple construction which
are capable of supplying stable and appropriate
quantities of inks of different colors and are less
subjected to the influence of environmental
changes such as temperature variations than
prior constructions. According, therefore, to the present invention, there is
provided an ink tank according to independent claim 1
and an ink supply system according to independent claim
5. Further advantageous features of the ink tank and the
ink supply system are evident from the dependent claims.The ink tank for supplying a proper amount of ink needed
to a dot matrix printer head has a bottom wall, a top
wall and walls extending between them. The ink tank is
formed as an integral unit detachably mountable to a
printer head and is formed with a plurality of ink-supply
sections defined by the ink tank walls and
separation walls between the ink supply sections. Each
of said ink-supply sections has an ink supply port in
the bottom wall of the tank. The ink tank contains an
ink absorbing member or ink absorbing means, formed of a
porous material impregnated with ink, in each of said
ink-supply sections. Furthermore, the ink-supply

<CLAIMS>
An ink tank (2) for supplying a proper amount of ink
needed to a dot matrix printer head, said ink tank having

a bottom wall, a top wall and walls extending between
them, being formed as an integral unit detachably

mountable to a printer head and being formed with a
plurality of ink-supply sections defined by the ink tank

walls and separation walls between the ink supply
sections, each of said ink-supply sections having an ink

supply port (41) in the bottom wall of the tank, said ink
tank having an ink absorbing member, formed of a porous

material impregnated with ink, in each of said ink-supply
sections,


said ink-supply sections containing ink of different
colors,
and each ink-supply section having an air hole (42)
therein which communicates with air in a space formed

between the ink absorbing member and at least one wall of
the ink-supply section such that the ink absorbing member

is at a distance from the at least one wall of the ink-supply
section.
An ink tank as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
at least one of the ink-supply sections contains two ink

absorbing members (61, 62), the ink absorbing members (61,
62) having respective surfaces which are in direct contact

with each other, the ink supply port (41) being arranged
to receive ink from the second ink absorbing member (62), 

and the first ink absorbing member (61) having pores
therein whose average diameter is greater than those of

the second ink absorbing member (62).
An ink tank as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
the ink absorbing member is compressed in the vicinity of

the ink supply port (41).
An ink tank as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterized in that only a projecting portion, ridges or

a partition wall (44, 47, 48, 51) of the inner side of the
at least one wall of the ink supply section contacts the

ink absorbing member so that the remaining portion (40a,
40c, 45a, 45b, 45c, 50) of the at least one wall is spaced

from the ink absorbing member.
An ink supply system for a dot matrix printer head,
comprising an ink tank according to one of the preceding

claims and

a further separate ink tank, said ink tank having a bottom
wall, a top wall and walls extending between them and

being formed as a detachably mountable, integral unit with
an ink supply port in the bottom wall and an ink absorbing

member formed of a porous material impregnated with ink,
said separate ink tank containing black ink.
