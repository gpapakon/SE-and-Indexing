<ABSTRACT>
A medication dispenser 12 for use in a hospital or 
other medical setting comprises a plurality of containers 

for holding medication units, packaging apparatus for 
containing one or more medication units in a package and 

robotics for manipulating a selected container to 
transfer one or more medication units from the container 

directly to said package. Since medication is directly 
transferred from the container to the package, no cross-contamination 

occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to medical 
dispensing machines, and more particularly to a medical 
dispenser system to provide medications to nurses in a 
hospital setting.  The efficient and accurate distribution of 
medication in a hospital is an extremely important facet 
of patient care. In a typical hospital setting, 
medication orders are initiated by a physician, who 
contacts a pharmacist in the hospital's pharmacy. In 
response to the physician's request, the pharmacist enters 
information into the hospital's pharmacy computer system, 
which is typically implemented on a mainframe computer. 
The pharmacy computer system maintains a database of 
information concerning each patient in the hospital and 
performs a number of functions necessary to enable the 
pharmacy to efficiently distribute medications. For 
example, the pharmacy computer system maintains 
information on each patient, such as the patient's 
location in the hospital, whether the patient has any 
allergies to medication, the diagnosis, if any, for the 
patient, the patient's primary physician, the patient's 
personal data (height, weight, age, blood type), the date 
of admission, and so on. Further, the pharmacy computer 
system maintains a database of medications which may be 
ordered by the physicians. This database may include, 
for example, the NDC code for the medication, the 
manufacturer, the brand name, the generic name, the 
dosage form, the location of the drug in the pharmacy, 
and pricing information. For each medication ordered for 
a patient, the pharmacy system maintains a database of 
the medication ordered, the frequency of administration, 
start and stop dates (and times) for administration, and 
the nursing station to which the medication should be 
delivered. Pharmacy computer systems have been widely 
available since at least 1985. Their availability has 
greatly increased the accuracy and efficiency of the 
hospital pharmacy.  Based on the information in the pharmacy computer 
system, the pharmacy prepares the medications for each 
patient. Carts containing the medications are brought to 
the nursing stations, where the nurse retrieves the 
medication for his or her patients and then administers 
the medication. Typically, a separate container holding 
the medications for each patient are provided on the 
cart. To aid the nurses, a medication administration 
report (MAR) is provided from the pharmacy computer 
system, so that the nurse can verify that each patient 
has received all scheduled medication.
