<ABSTRACT>
Each illuminator of a two-dimensional array 1 is illuminated in turn and 
directs light to a correction lens 2. Light from the lens 2 passes through 

a microlens array 3 and a spatial light modulator 4, for instance of the 
liquid crystal type. The pixels of the modulator 4 are aligned with 

respective microlenses of the array 3 and are individually controllable so 
as to vary the amount of light which they pass. The microlenses form 

images on a film or diffuser at an image plane 5 of the illuminators of the 
array 1. Image data supplied to the modulator 4 is changed for each 

change of illuminated illuminator so that a complete image is formed for 
a complete cycle of illumination of all the illuminators of the array 1. 

Thus, each pixel of the modulator 4 produces by temporal multiplexing a 
plurality of sub-pixels at the image plane 5. The resolution of the 

modulator 4 is thus effectively enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical apparatus. Such an apparatus
may be used to increase the resolution of a spatial light modulator (SLM)
for display or printing applications.EP-A-0 301 715 discloses a display in which red, green and blue light
sources are disposed behind liquid crystal devices acting as optical
shutters. The shutters are controlled to allow the red, green and blue
light sources to be presented in sequence to a spatial light modulator so
as to build a full colour image.GB 2 206 763A discloses an autostereoscopic display apparatus in which
the position of an illuminator with respect to a spatial light modulator is
moved so as to image views in different directions.A known spatial light modulator comprises a two-dimensional array of
picture elements (pixels). Each pixel comprises a liquid crystal device
whose transmissivity to optical radiation such as light can be individually
controlled. Thus, when a light source is placed behind the SLM, light
passing through the SLM is spatially modulated by controlling the
transmissivity of the pixels. Such an arrangement may be used as part of
a display or printing apparatus with the pixels of the SLM being
modulated so as to represent image data to be displayed or printed.The size and maximum resolution of the SLM are limited by practical
considerations during manufacture. The resolution is limited by the
minimum size of pixel which can be provided, for instance by liquid
crystal technology. The maximum size of SLM and the maximum 
resolution are limited by manufacturing yields which can be
economically obtained. For large size high resolution SLIM's, the
manufacturing yields are relatively low so that the cost of such SLMs is
high. The maximum resolution is further limited by the minimum size of
liquid crystal pixel which can be manufactured.According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an
apparatus as defined in the appended Claim 1.According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an
apparatus as defined in the appended Claim 13.Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the other
appended claims.It is thus possible to provide an apparatus in which the resolution of a
SLM is effectively increased without the need to reduce the size of the
pixels. Thus, relatively large high resolution display and printing
arrangements can be provided without the problems of poor
manufacturing yield which are associated with large SLMs in which the
pixel size is reduced.The invention will be further described
