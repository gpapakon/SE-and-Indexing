<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a capillary (10) comprises the steps of providing first 
a capillary having a uniform inner width throughout its length, introducing then 

an etchant into the capillary, and producing a temperature gradient over the 
length of the capillary (10) in such a way that a temperature-controlled increased 

expansion of the inner width of the capillary (10) will take place during the 
etching process in the heated region thereof. 
A capillary produced in this way is excellently suitable for use in an 
electrophoresis device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with a method of producing an electrophoresis
capillary, and with a capillary of the type which is adapted to be used for an
electrophoresis device.There are various techniques for rapidly and accurately identifying small
quantities of inorganic and organic substances. When such substances, whose
molecular structure is comparatively small, are to be detected, gas
chromatographs and liquid chromatographs have been used for this detection
for years. Although chromatography proved to be a successful attempt to
determine metals and inorganic mixtures as well as small organic ions, this
technique used for determining a constituent part in a sample is not suitable
for determining large and complex molecules, such as amino acids, proteins
and DNA.Hence, another analysis technique, which is called electrophoresis, has been
used with great success for some years. This technique comprises the step of
applying an electric field across the length of a capillary that contains a 
mixture of an unknown sample and a non-reactive liquid, which is referred to
as sample solution. The electric field causes the constituents of the unknown
sample to migrate through the capillary due to the electrical attraction created
by the electric field. Different components within the sample are attracted at
different rates due to their varying molecular properties (molecular drag) and
varying electrical charges. Hence, the substances become increasingly
separated into distinct zones or groups as they progress along the capillary.
Each band of constituent material that makes up the original, unseparated
mixture of the unknown sample material passes through the capillary. At some
point along the capillary, the band is examined and identified by a detector.
One typical detector for electrophoresis separation measures the electrical
conductivity of the bands in the capillary. An alternative detection scheme
uses fluorescence, for example laser induced fluorescence. Although this
technique is comparatively sensitive, it is costly and limited to specific
mixtures that can be stimulated to fluoresce.In other electrophoresis systems, an optical detection technique is used, which
comprises the step of measuring the light absorption caused by the bands,
which are separated from one another over the electrophoresis path. In
conventional electrophoresis devices, the sensitivity of this type of optical
detection is only very low due to the short path that the light travels through
the interior of the capillary. An
