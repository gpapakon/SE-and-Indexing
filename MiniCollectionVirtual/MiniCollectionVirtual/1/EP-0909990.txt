<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the area of improved photopolymerizable compositions
that can be processed to produce a relief image (e.g., an imaged photoresist pattern
or an imaged proofing or flexographic printing plate pattern) having improved
sidewall geometry and development latitude.Photopolymerizable compositions are used to form a photoresist (or resist)
layer on a substrate, such as copper-clad glass epoxy, to allow subsequent
selective processing of the substrate, such as selective etching or electroplating.
Photopolymerizable compositions are also used to form a permanent solder mask
layer on an imaged substrate to protect the underlying circuit lines from solder
exposure during the later step of soldering in printed circuit board (PCB)
manufacture. The use of photoresists and solder masks for manufacture of printed
circuit boards (PCBs) is described in Photoresist - Materials and Processes, by
William S. DeForest, McGraw-Hill, 1975, in Printed Circuits Handbook, edited
by Clyde F. Coombs, Jr., McGraw-Hill, 1988 (3rd Edition), and in Handbook of
Printed Circuit Manufacturing by Raymond H. Clark, Van Nostrand Reinhold,
1985. Photopolymerizable resist materials are known, for example, from U.S. Pat.
3,469,982 which describes a film resist with a sandwich structure in the form of a
photopolymerizable layer between a cover sheet and a temporary support.
Photoresist and solder mask products that have substantially all of the solvent for
coating removed are known as dry films. The use of photopolymerizable proofing
films for off-press proofing in the printing industry is described in Principles of
Color Proofing, by Michael H. Bruno, GAMA Communications (Salem,NH),
1986. The use of flexographic photopolymer films for use in production of
flexographic printing plates is described in Flexography - Principles and Practices,
Fourth Edition, Foundation of Flexographic Technical Association,
(Ronkonkoma, NY), 1992.As the technology level of printed circuit boards increases towards finer
lines/spaces, the demands placed on the photoresist materials used to produce such
boards becomes greater. This in turn places a greater burden on the resist
formulator to accommodate improved performance, without a decrease in
production level or an increase in manufacturing cost of the photoresist product.
Similiar considerations apply for use of photopolymerizable compositions in
proofing and flexographic printing. For use in the manufacture of printed circuit boards (PCBs) having fine
lines/spaces, it is critical that the
