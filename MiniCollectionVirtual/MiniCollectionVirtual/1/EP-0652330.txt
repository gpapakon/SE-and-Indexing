<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a concrete-containing moulded object for gutters, gullies or similar elements of a gutter system, having a liquid-tight and chemical-resistant layer which is arranged in a U-shaped or rectangular clearance. The moulded object is characterised in that the layer (12) is connected in a liquid-tight manner, via layer regions (14), longitudinally on both sides to plastic strips (16) and on the end side to plastic brackets (15) in order to form a three-dimensional, permanent part of a shuttering (10) which is surrounded by the concrete body (28). The invention further relates to a method of making such a moulded object.

A concrete-containing moulded object for
gutters, gullies or similar elements of a gutter

system, having a liquid-tight and chemical-resistant
layer arranged in a U-shaped or rectangular recess,

characterized in that the layer (12) is connected in a
liquid-tight manner by means of layer regions (14)

longitudinally on both sides to plastic strips (16) and
at the end faces to plastic brackets (15) for forming a

three-dimensional, permanent part of a formwork (10),
which is surrounded by the concrete element (28).
A concrete-containing moulded object according
to claim 1, characterized in that devices, in

particular grooves (20), for the receiving and sealed
fastening of sealing sheets (32) are arranged on the

plastic strips (16).
A moulded object according to either of claims
1 and 2, characterized in that the plastic strips (16)

are provided on the upper longitudinal edges with a
casing profile (18) for receiving and fastening a

covering (34).
A moulded object according to any one of claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the end faces of the

moulded object (30) are each provided with a plastic
bracket (15), which are welded to parts of the plastic

layer (14) and to the plastic strips (16).
A moulded object according to any one of claims
1 to 4, characterized in that each plastic bracket (15)

has in preferably the lower region a first profiling
(46) and, on the side facing away, a profiling (48)

complementing the first profiling, with the result that
the two sides of a plastic bracket (15) fit together

like a female mould and a male mould.
A moulded object according to one or more of
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the plastic strips

(16) are each connected to a casing profile (18) for
receiving the covering (34), the casings being fastened

by means of screws (36) screwed into threaded sleeves 
(40), there being inserted into the threaded sleeves

from below anchoring screws (36'), which are anchored
in the concrete core (28).
A moulded object according to one or more of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the layer

(12) has on its side facing the concrete core (28)
anchors (22) for the positive engagement of the layer

(12) in the concrete core (28).
A moulded object according to one or more of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the layer

(12), the plastic strips (16) and the plastic brackets
(15) consist of polyethylene (HDPE).
A moulded object according to one or more of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the layer

(12) has a thickness of from 2 mm to 10 mm.
A method of making a concrete-containing
moulded object for gutters, gullies or similar elements

of a gutter system according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that plastic strips

are attached in a liquid-tight manner by adhesive
bonding or welding to the longitudinal side edges of a

flexible plastic layer (12) or of a plastic part bent
in a U-shaped form, and in that plastic brackets (15),

provided with appropriate clearances, are attached in a
liquid-tight manner by welding or adhesive bonding to

the end-face regions of the layer (12) bent in a U-shaped
form or of the moulded object already shaped in

a rectangular form, the thus preformed rigid, three-dimensional
form being used as a permanent part in a

formwork (10) with lateral walls (24), into which
formwork the concrete mass is subsequently filled.
A method according to claim 10, characterized
in that the plastic strips (16) on the longitudinal

edges of the layer (12) are provided with the casing
profile (18) for a covering before the casting.
