<ABSTRACT>
A P diffused layer (12) has an impurity surface concentration ranging from 
1 x 10¹⁵ cm⁻³ to 1 x 10¹⁷ cm⁻³ and a thickness ranging from 0.1 µm to 3.0 

µm. Since the P diffused layer (12) has lower impurity surface concentration, 
an injection of minority carriers from the P diffused layer (12) to an N⁻ 

semiconductor substrate (11) during a forward operation is suppressed, so that 
reverse recovery electric charges decrease. Since the P diffused layer (12) is 

thinner, the reverse recovery electric charges further decrease and a forward 
voltage is reduced. A peak of a reverse recovery current becomes smaller as 

the reverse recovery electric charges decrease. In consequence, a soft recovery 
is achieved, to therefore decrease a surge voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a semiconductor device which 
has a PN junction, and more particularly to improvements related to a decrease 
of reverse recovery electric charges in a high-speed switching diode and the 
like. Fig. 31 is a sectional view showing a structure of a conventional high-speed 
switching diode 100 which has a PN junction. Fig. 32 is a schematic 
diagram showing a distribution of impurity concentration in the direction along 
a longitudinal section of the diode 100. This figure illustrates a relation 
between the thickness X in the direction along the longitudinal section and the 
impurity concentration ρ of the diode 100 in a semi-logarithmic scale. The diode 100 comprises an N⁻ semiconductor substrate 1 of low impurity 
concentration, an N⁺ diffused layer 3 of high impurity concentration on the 
lower main surface of the N⁻ semiconductor substrate 1 and a P diffused layer 
2 having an impurity concentration ρ s over 1 x 10¹⁷cm⁻³ in its surface and a 
thickness D0 over 20 µm on the upper main surface of the N⁻ semiconductor 
substrate 1. The diode 100 further comprises a metal electrode layer 4 on the upper 
surface of the P diffused layer 2 and a metal electrode layer 5 on the lower  
 
surface of the N⁺ diffused layer 3. The metal electrode layers 4 and 5 are 
formed while being in ohmic contact with the P diffused layer 2 and the N⁺ 
diffused layer 3, respectively. In order to decrease reverse recovery electric charges in a switching 
operation conducted by using the diode 100, it is required that the number of 
minority carriers accumulated in the P-type semiconductor layer 2 and N-type 
semiconductor layers 1 and 3, respectively, during a forward operation should 
be small. To meet the requirement, metals such as gold, platinum or the like 
have been diffused to act as lifetime killer in conventional arts. In this method, 
however, there is a disadvantage that a forward voltage remarkably increases as 
the reverse recovery electric charges decrease. In order to suppress a surge voltage developed during a reverse recovery, 
it is necessary to achieve a soft recovery waveform of a reverse recovery 
current. To achieve the soil recovery waveform of the reverse recovery current, 
however, it is required that the number of minority carriers (positive holes) 
accumulated in a region in the vicinity of an interface of the N⁻ semiconductor 
substrate 1 and N⁺ diffused layer 3 during the forward operation, to which a 
depletion layer comes during the reverse recovery,
