<ABSTRACT>
A touch trigger probe for a coordinate measuring machine or 
machine tool has a stylus (14), which is biased into a rest 

position. The stylus has two independent supports, 
provided within a housing (10). In the embodiment of Fig 

1, the first support comprises an axially projecting skirt 
(18) of a stylus holder (12), which is axially constrained 

on a surface (20) of the housing (10). The second support 
comprises a support element biased into contact with an 

inclined surface; more particularly a kinematic arrangement 
of cylinders (34) and balls (36), which provide lateral 

constraint. The second support is distinct from the skirt 
(18) and the surface (20) and is closer to the axis than 

the skirt. This improves the lateral constraint during the 
commencement of tilting of the stylus, for example by 

reducing wobble transverse to the plane of tilting when the 
support element disengages from the inclined surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to touch probes for position 
determining apparatus such as machine tools and coordinate 
measuring machines. Such machines have a spindle, quill or arm which is movable 
in two or three dimensions and which can carry a touch 
probe or other tool. Scales or other measuring devices 
measure the position of the probe or tool in the two or 
three dimensions. A touch probe for use with such a 
machine has a deflectable stylus extending from its body, 
for contacting a workpiece surface. Soviet Union invention disclosure no. SU 460426 describes a 
touch probe for position determining apparatus, comprising:
 
   a fixed housing member having an axis;
 
   a movable member for carrying a workpiece-contacting 
stylus;
 
   bias means for biasing the movable member into a rest 
position relative to the fixed member, the movable member 
being movable out of the rest position against the action 
of the bias means when a force is applied to the stylus;
 
   an axially projecting skirt defining a first annular 
surface on said movable member, and a second annular 
surface on said fixed member, the annular surfaces axially 
confronting each other and extending around the axis and 
being engageable such that said skirt tilts to permit 
tilting of the movable member when the stylus contacts a 
workpiece while said second annular surface does not tilt;
 
   a lateral constraint, including a support element 
connected to the movable member, and a surface connected to 
the fixed member, which surface is inclined to the axis, 
the support element being axially biased by the bias means  
 
into contact with said inclined surface, thereby providing 
lateral constraint when in contact; and
 
   means for detecting deflection of the movable member 
out of the rest position. In this probe, the support element of the lateral 
constraint forms part of the axially projecting skirt. Touch probes with axially projecting skirts are also known 
from German Patent Applications DE 37 15 698 and 
DE 32 46 252. In these probes, however, the lateral 
constraint takes the form of a planar spring, rather than a 
support element which is biased into contact with an 
inclined surface. International Patent Application WO91/10887 (published 25th 
July, 1991) shows a probe having various features similar 
to SU 460426. Additionally, it shows a support element and 
an inclined surface which are distinct from the axially 
projecting skirt and second annular surface, and which are 
located closer to the axis than said skirt.

<CLAIMS>
A touch probe for position determining apparatus, 
comprising: 

   a fixed structure, by which the probe may be connected 
to the movable arm of the machine, the fixed structure 

having an axis; 
   a movable member, carrying an elongate stylus having a 

sensing tip at a free end thereof, the movable member being 
axially biased into a position relative to the fixed 

structure from which it is displaceable when a deflecting 
force is applied to the sensing tip; 

   the movable member including thereon an axially facing 
annular surface, extending around and in a plane orthogonal 

to the axis, the movable member being tiltable relative to 
the fixed structure about a contact point on said surface 

when a force is applied to the sensing tip in a direction 
transverse to the length of the stylus, thereby to actuate 

signalling means for generating a trigger signal to be sent 
to the machine, the deflecting force required to actuate 

said signalling means thereby being equal in all directions 
perpendicular to said axis; 

   a constraint for locating said movable member 
transversely relative to the axis, including a seating, the 

seating being provided by mutually engageable elements 
having inclined surfaces which are disengageable when said 

stylus tilts beyond a given angle relative to said axis, 
but remain engaged during at least a part of said tilting; 

   wherein said annular surface and said seating are 
axially spaced from each other, with the seating being 

located closer in a direction along said axis to the 
sensing tip than the annular surface. 
A touch probe according to claim 1, wherein said 
mutually engageable elements remain engaged with each other 

during the commencement of said tilting, thereby continuing 
to locate said movable member transversely during the 

commencement of tilting, and wherein said mutually 
 

engageable elements disengage from each other as further 
tilting occurs. 
A touch probe according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the annular surface of the movable member faces axially 

towards the sensing tip. 
A touch probe according to any one of the preceding 
claims, further including a planar spring for constraining 

movement of the movable member relative to the fixed 
structure.
