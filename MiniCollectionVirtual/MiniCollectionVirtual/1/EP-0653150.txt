<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with a fluorescent tube driver arranged to be supplied by a direct voltage source (particularly a voltage source less than 50 volts, preferably 24 volts nominal) and having a tube drive output in the range 10 to 100 watts of arc power (preferably 10 to 40 watts) with a frequency of oscillation in the range 15 to 50 KHz (preferably 32 KHz nominal), the driver comprising an arc waveform transformer (22), the primary winding (23) of which is supplied with a variable drive current derived from the low voltage source (15), and the secondary winding (25) of which is adapted to be connected to the electrodes (13, 14) of a fluorescent tube (12), such that in use an alternating tube arc current will flow through the secondary winding and tube. The drive includes a closed loop control system (31-44) provided for maintaining substantially constant the tube arc current by varying the amplitude of the arc current waveform without varying the pulse width. This extends the tube life and reduces the wasted heat. The arc transformer driver (24) and arc current are selected to give a symmetrical arc waveform with a constant waveform duty cycle in the range 90 to 95 %, and a tube arc power less than 90 % of the rated tube power, and to maintain at a constant value in the range 1.3 to 1.5 the arc crest factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUORESCENT TUBE DRIVER AND LIGHTING SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a fluorescent tube driver and a fluorescent lighting system including such a driver.The invention is concerned with a driver working from a direct voltage supply, preferably but not essentially a low voltage supply (less than 50 volts) and including an oscillator circuit producing a relatively high frequency oscillation (15 to 50 KHz preferably 25 to 50 KHz) and including a transformer supplying arc current to the fluorescent tube. Known circuits operating from a direct voltage supply at a high frequency are described for example in UK Patent Sp cifications 1010208 , 1308578 , 2126810, 2246034, 2244608, 2212995 and 2095930. However these operate by controlling the current to the driver by varying the pulse width.The present invention particularly aims to provide a driver capable of operating at high efficiency and which is particularly suited for use in heat conscious and energy saving environments. Additionally the invention aims to produce a driver which will promote optimum tube life.Summary of the InventionThe invention is particularly concerned with a fluorescent tube driver arranged to be supplied by a direct voltage source (particularly a voltage source less than 50 volts, preferably 24 volts nominal) and having a tube driver output in the range 10 to 100 watts of arc power (preferably 10 to 40 watts) with a frequency of oscillation in the range 15 to 50 KHz (preferably 32 KHz nominal) , the driver comprising an arc waveform transformer, the primary winding of which is supplied with a variable drive current derived from the low voltage source, and the secondary winding of which is adapted to be connected to the electrodes of a 

fluorescent tube, such that in use an alternating tube arc current will flow through the secondary winding and tube. The driver of the present invention is of the above type and has a number of novel and advantageous features which may be claimed independently or in any combination. These are as follows:A closed loop control system is provided for maintaining substantially constant the tube arc current by varying the amplitude of the arc current waveform. This preferably comprises means for measuring the arc current flowing through the secondary winding and tube to produce a measured signal representing actual arc current supply, means for generating a reference signal representing desired arc current, comparator means for comparing the measured signal and the reference signal
