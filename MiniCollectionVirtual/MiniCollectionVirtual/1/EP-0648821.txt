<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink, in
particular, an ink suitable for use in ink-jet recording,
and an ink-jet recording method using such an ink and ink-jet
recording instruments containing the ink therein.Inks with greatly various manners of being composed
have been hitherto reported in respect of inks for writing
utensils (fountain pens, marking pens, ball-point pens
making use of a water-based ink, etc.) and for ink-jet
recording. In particular, in recent years, detailed
researches and developments have been made from various
aspects such as compositions and physical properties of
inks because of a strong demand for improving the water
fastness of images recorded on plain paper such as paper
for copying, paper for reporting, notepaper and letter
paper, which are commonly used in offices.For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Nos. 2-296878, 2-255876 and 57-57760 disclose a method of
improving the water fastness of the resulting recorded
images.In such a technique, there is however a potential 
problem that the water fastness of the recorded image may
be insufficient, its quality may be deteriorated, its
drying characteristics may be poor, or the stability or
clogging resistance of an ink used may be impaired.The EP-A-0 452 096 discloses a an ink for thermal ink-jet
printing comprising an organic sulfonic acid salt.Furthermore, FR-A-2 385 782 discloses an ink composition
for ink jet printing comprising, inter alia, an electrolyte
substance which can be selected from an acid, an alkali or
a salt thereof, for example p-toluene sulfonic acid and
triethanolamine.It is accordingly an object of the present invention
to provide an ink which can provide recorded images having
sufficient water fastness without adversely affecting
their quality when conducting recording on so-called plain
paper such as acid paper and neutralized paper, commonly
used in offices and the like, and permits high-quality
printing without the least problem even after stored in a
high-temperature environment and also without the problem
of clogging, and an ink-jet recording method and
instruments using such an ink.The above object can be achieved by the present
invention described below.According to the present invention, there is thus
provided an ink comprising a coloring material and a
liquid medium dissolving or dispersing the coloring
material therein, wherein the ink contains in combination
a compound of the general formula

wherein R1 denotes hydrogen, a nitro group or an amino  
group, and R2 denotes a salt
