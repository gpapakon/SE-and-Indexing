<ABSTRACT>
A lintel (11) for block and brick walls with pins, posts or stops (14, 28, 29) to project into perpends of the course of bricks laid thereover. The pins might be in pairs (28, 29) and be associated with reinforcement (31, 39) in a lintel formed of concrete.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title; "LINTELS"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(1) Field of the InventionTHIS INVENTION relates to lintels and, in particular, to lintels made of concrete and the like.(2) Prior ArtLintels of various kinds are used in brick walls to continue brickwork over the top of doors and windows. Commonly the lintel is a length of angle iron with the iron overlapped at its ends over the top of the course of bricks at each side of a window or door opening which finishes at the upper level of the door or window. A variation of this style of lintel is seen in US 4106247. The brickwork then continues with the next course extended over the iron lintel. In time such lintels are corroded particularly in environments such as at the seaside. Concrete lintels are used, but for these to have any long term stability against sagging, they must be large in cross-section and they are visually obvious within a brick wall unless specially treated with facing bricks. Large sectioned lintels in concrete are heavy and not readily handled on a building site.OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a lintel which is basically relatively easy to handle on a building site and, in use, resists sagging and corrosion to a degree greater than hitherto possible. NATURE OF THE INVENTION The invention achieves its object by providing a lintel for spanning openings such as windows, doors and the like in a brick, block, or other like type wall comprising: an elongate body part sufficient in length to span the opening with an upper surface for the laying 

of courses of bricks, blocks, etc. thereover; characterised in that there is provided a plurality of upstanding pins, posts or stops arrayed along the length of the upper surface of the elongate body part; said pins, posts or stops being provided in a predetermined pattern for projection into the perpends between bricks or blocks laid, in use, over the lintel to resist shear induced by the bricks thereover. The term pins, posts or stops used herein is to be taken to encompass any member which projects from the surface of the lintel to project into the perpend between bricks thereover and provide resistance to shear. Thus pins, posts or stops (referred to for convenience simply as pins or posts with the intention that the broader function of a stop is to be read into the term) might have a variety of geometries so long as their shape is consistent with the need to project into a perpend and resist shear. A pin, post or stop might therefore have planar, plate form

CLAIMS
1. A lintel for spanning openings such as windows, doors and the like in a brick, block, or other like type walls comprising: an elongate body part sufficient in length to span the opening with an upper surface for the laying of courses of bricks, blocks, etc. thereover; characterised in that there is a plurality of upstanding pins, posts or stops arrayed along the length of the upper surface of the elongate body part; said pins, posts or stops being provided in a predetermined pattern for projection into the perpends between bricks or blocks laid, in use, over the lintel to resist shear induced by the bricks thereover. 2. A lintel as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: said elongate body part is uniform in cross- section therealong, with a cross-section matching that of a course of bricks or blocks.
3. A lintel as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: said pins, posts or stops are in spaced apart pairs, each pin, post or stop of a pair extending, in use, into the same perpend.
4. A lintel as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: the number of pins, posts or stops per unit length of the lintel is reduced at the centre thereof as compared with its ends.
5. A lintel as claimed in Claim 4 wherein: the centre of the lintel is free of pins, posts or stops over a length equal to a multiple of bricks, and enough pins, posts or stops exist at each side thereof to project into every perpend outside the pin, post or stop free centre region.
6. A lintel as claimed in Claim 1 wherein: said elongate body part is concrete. 7. A lintel as claimed in Claim 6 wherein: 


 reinforcement extends internally through the elongate length of the body part, and the pins, posts or stops are steel rod-form elements attached thereto.
8. A lintel as claimed in Claim 7 wherein: the pins, posts or stops are established by the arms of a generally U-shaped element embedded in the elongate body part with the upper arm ends of the generally U-shaped elements projecting therefrom.
9. A lintel as claimed inr Claim 1 wherein: the face thereof which is oriented outwardly, in use, is provided with brick tiles to duplicate a course of bricks and match those of a wall incorporating the lintel.
10. A lintel as claimed in Claim 2 wherein: the number of pins, posts or stops per unit length of the lintel is reduced at the centre thereof as compared with its ends.
11. A lintel as claimed in Claim 10 wherein: the centre of the lintel is free of pins, posts or stops over a length equal to a multiple or bricks, and enough pins, posts or stops exist at each side thereof to project into every perpend outside the pin, post or stop free region.
12. A lintel as claimed in Claim 9 wherein: said pins, posts or stops are in spaced apart pairs, each pin, post or stop of a pair extends, in use, into the same perpend.
13. A lintel as claimed in Claim 12 wherein: the number of pairs per unit length is reduced at the centre of the lintel as compared with its ends.
14. A lintel as claimed in Claim 13 wherein the centre of the lintel is free of said pairs over a length equal to a multiple of bricks, and enough pairs exist at each side thereof to project into every perpend outside 


the pair free centre region.
15. A lintel as claimed in Claim 14 wherein the elongate body part is concrete.
26. A lintel as claimed in Claim 15 wherein: reinforcement extends internally through the body part and the pairs are the arms of U-shaped elements embedded in the body part with the ends of the U-shaped element's arms projected therefrom.
