<ABSTRACT>
The analog timepiece, in particular a wristwatch, having timekeeping and display means (5, 21, 22) as well as motorised driving means and a battery (9) in a housing (1) additionally comprises means arranged in the timepiece housing (1) for measuring and displaying, in particular, atomic radiation, which means have a bendable circuit carrier (2), which is folded into the housing (1), is developed in a planar fashion, and has a printed circuit. Said circuit carrier connects a sensor (detector, detecting element) (3) to the display means via a circuit (4) for amplification and evaluation.

<CLAIMS>
Analogue clock, in particular wristwatch, having watch and dial means as well 
as motor-driven actuating means and battery in one housing and additional means 

for measuring and indicating, especially of nuclear radiation, disposed in the 
watch housing, characterized in that the means for measuring and indicating 

nuclear radiation include a circuitry carrier (2) with a printed circuit that is folded 
into the housing (1), flexible, and planar in its development, which circuitry carrier 

connects a measuring sensor (3) with the indicator means via an amplifier and 
evaluator circuit (4), whereby the folded-in, flexible circuitry carrier (2) encompasses 

a first intermediate plate (6) carrying the watch work (5) by bending of 
planar parts (7, 7') which project in the development of the circuitry carrier (2), 

and that with another planar part (8) it reaches under a second intermediate 
plate (10) carrying the primary battery (9) for the watch drive and whereby the 

circuitry means of the circuitry carrier (2) connect the primary battery (9) and a 
secondary battery (11) used for saving of data with the amplifier and evaluator 

circuit (4). 
An analogue clock as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that one of the intermediate 
plates (6 or 10) includes a projection (13) for support of the measuring 

sensor (3) which is surrounded by an extension (14) of the watch housing 
(1). 
An analogue clock as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the secondary 
battery (11) for saving of data is connected via the amplifier and evaluator circuit 

(4) and cooperates with a detector so as to detect and indicate a voltage drop at  
 

the primary battery (9) of the watch, and to perform an automatic switchover 
from the primary battery (9) to the secondary battery (11). 
An analogue clock as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the means for 
indicating radiation are connected to a computer testing and evaluating unit. 
An analogue clock as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the means for 
indicating radiation are LCD displays (16, 17). 
An analogue clock as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the means for 
indicating radiation include an additional dial train. 
An analogue clock as claimed in claim 1, characterized by a connection between 
the motor of the watch work (5) and the dosimeter time base of the multiprocessor 

(4) to ensure exact time measurands.
