<ABSTRACT>
A geosynthetic clay liner (10) is disclosed for providing 
barriers in landfills that substantially preclude the migration 

of liquids. The geosynthetic clay liner includes a layer of 
bentonite (12) disposed between a primary carrier sheet (11) and a cover 

sheet (13). The primary carrier sheet and the cover sheet are linked 
via plurality of tufting threads (14). 

A bight or loop portion (16) of the 
tufting thread extends through to the undersurface of the lower 

or primary carrier sheet and is partially melted to prevent the 
bight portion from slipping back through the primary carrier 

sheet (11). The partially melted bight portions (16) create an under 
surface with a high coefficient of friction thereby enabling the 

geosynthetic clay liner to be installed on steep slopes or banks 
of landfills or ponds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to geosynthetic clay liners 
for use in creating a low permeability bottom layer in waste 
containment sites and man-made bodies of water. More 
particularly, the invention relates to a geosynthetic clay liner 
consisting of two textile sheets, known as a primary carrier 
sheet and a cover sheet, with a bentonite layer disposed 
therebetween. The primary carrier sheet and the cover sheet are 
connected using a tufting process and the bight or loop portions 
of the tufts are then melted, interlocked, knotted, looped, 
buttoned or otherwise fastened to prevent the tufts from pulling 
out of the textile sheets. The present invention addresses three problems: (1) the 
lack of stability of geosynthetic clay liners on slopes or 
embankments; (2) the problems associated with the use of 
adhesives or glue in the manufacture of geosynthetic clay liners; 
and (3) the requirement imposed by needlepunching process that 
at least one nonwoven fabric be employed in the construction of 
the geosynthetic clay liner. The concept of using bentonite to create a low permeability 
layer for use in landfills and man-made bodies of water is well 
known. Bentonite is a naturally occurring clay material which 
expands upon being exposed to water. When dry bentonite 
is wetted and thereafter expands, the bentonite is capable of 
substantially precluding the migration of liquids through it if 
properly contained.  
 It is also well known to provide bentonite in sheet or roll 
form by gluing or adhering bentonite to a sheet of textile 
material, hereinafter known as the primary carrier sheet. 
Another term used interchangeably with primary carrier sheet is 
primary textile. An upper layer of textile material may be 
provided thereby disposing the bentonite between two layers of 
textile material. The upper layer is hereinafter referred to as 
the cover sheet. Other terms used interchangeably with cover 
sheet include secondary textile, secondary carrier sheet and 
scrim. The bentonite in roll-form is often referred to as a 
geosynthetic clay liner by those skilled in the art. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) provided in rolls are easily 
applied to large surface areas, such as a landfill or a man-made 
pond or lake, by simply unrolling the liners in a manner similar 
to the laying of carpet. When the bentonite is exposed to water 
it expands between the two textile sheets and forms a barrier 
with a very low permeability. At least three problems are associated with the above 
technique for providing
