<ABSTRACT>
Novel water-soluble polyperfluoroalkylated surfactants derived from polycarboxylic functional polymers and having oil and alcohol repellent properties enabling their use in synthetic or protein-based extinguishing foam compositions for putting out not only burning hydrocarbons but also burning polar liquids (alcohols, ethers, esters, etc.) without requiring thickening agents such as polysaccharides.

New water-soluble polyperfluoroalkyl surfactants, derived from functional 
polycarboxylic polymers, characterised by the fact they are not only oleophobic, 

but mainly with a strong alcophobic property, that they are compatible with 
anionic surfactant agents and protein derivatives, that their molecular structure 

has no organic quaternary nitrogen atom and has at least two perfluoroalkyl 
groups with from 4 to 20 carbon atoms bonded indirectly to the polymer's 

carboxylic functions through an ester or amide bond (in the case of an amidation 
bond, the nitrogen atom must have a hydrophilic group to promote alcophobia)
