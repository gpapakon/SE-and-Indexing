<ABSTRACT>

differential transformer wherein the demodulator adjusts 

for phase shift in the transformer and maintains the full 
bandwidth of the transformer, the demodulator (10) 

obtaining the maximum positive or negative amplitude of the 
sinusoidal signal at one of the secondary windings of the 

transformer by first counting (14) either a positive or 
negative half cycle of the signal and then, while down 

counting (18) one half of the counting half cycle, sampling 
(20) the amplitude of the sinusoidal signal. The sampling 

(20) ends when the down count reaches zero.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sinusoidal signal peak
amplitude detection, such as in association with the use of
a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) for
position detection, and more particularly in the detection
of the secondary voltages of the LVDT.A LVDT is used in a control system to provide a
voltage which is representative of the position of a
controlled device such as a valve. As is well known, the
LVDT has a primary winding which receives a sinusoidal
excitation voltage and two secondary windings. The LVDT
also includes an iron core which is connected to the driver
that provides the input to change the position of the
controlled device. As the output of the driver changes to
change the position of the controlled device the core moves
relative to the primary and secondary windings of the LVDT
to thereby change the amplitude of the AC voltage at the
output of each secondary winding.The output of each secondary winding of the LVDT is
connected to a peak amplitude detector which provides at
its output a DC signal representative of the position of
the controlled device. This DC signal is used as the
position feedback in a system for controlling the position
of the controlled device.One such detector well known to those skilled in the
art uses a sample/hold amplifier which is strobed by a
pulse synchronized to the primary of the LVDT to extract
the peak or trough voltages of the AC signals at the LVDT
secondary windings. However, this detector does not adjust
for phase shift in the LVDT and as a result thereof can 
produce a lower signal-to-noise ratio and lead to other
inaccuracies over time and with changes in temperature.
Therefore, this detector can require frequent
recalibration.Another such well known peak amplitude detector
rectifies and filters the sinusoidal signals at the outputs
of the LVDT secondary windings thereby obtaining RMS values
for those signals. While this known detector eliminates
the phase shift problems described above, it causes a
significant loss in bandwidth due to the extensive
filtering required in the detector. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a detector for use with a LVDT that both
eliminates any phase shift problems and maintains the full
LVDT bandwidth.JP-A-55 042 066 discloses a peak amplitude detector
which counts clock pulses over four full cycles of an AC
signal. The resulting count is then divided by sixteen to
obtain a quarter-cycle (zero-crossing to peak) count for
locating the signal peak.In one aspect the present invention provides a peak
amplitude
