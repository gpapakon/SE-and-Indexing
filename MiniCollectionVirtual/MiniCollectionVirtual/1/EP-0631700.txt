<ABSTRACT>
At least one drum (10) supporting at least one metal segment (13) adjustable angularly therearound is mounted on a shaft, and at least one inductive proximity sensor (15) is arranged in a plane perpendicular to the drum axis such that its working surface (16) is at a predetermined distance from the path of a metal segment (13) during rotation of the drum (10). Said inductive proximity sensor outputs a signal as a metal segment (13) crosses its sensing field.

Rotary programmer for travel-limit control, comprising 
a shaft (11) on which there is mounted at least one 

support carrying at least one angularly adjustable 
element for determining the instant when a travel-limit 

occurs, and an inductive proximity detector (15) that 
produces a signal when said angularly adjustable element 

moves within its field of detection, characterised 
in that the support is comprised of a drum (10) carrying 

at least one metallic segment (13) that is angularly 
adjustable in position along its periphery, the drum 

(10) being mounted on said shaft (11) which is coupled 
to a driving shaft (21) by means of a clutch plate (22) 

locked in connecting position by a switch-lock (23), 
the inductive proximity detector (15) being disposed in 

a plane extending transversally the drum axis such that 
its active face (16) is located at a predetermined 

distance from the travel of the metallic segment (13) 
during rotation of the drum. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the switch-lock (23) consists in an arm pivotally 

jointed to a pivot (24) so as to be able to pivot in a 
transversal plane in relation to the drum carrying 

shaft. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised by 
comprising an indicating element for responding to a 

signal from the inductive proximity detector. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the indicating element is a luminescent diode.
