<ABSTRACT>
A process and electrolyte for forming mound-free coatings of zinc-iron alloy on metal, e.g. steel, sheet and strip comprises passing the article to be plated through an electrolyte bath containing chlorides of iron and zinc and from about 2 to about 6 g/l, and particularly about 2.5 to about 3.5 g/l, of citric acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to iron-zinc 
electrogalvanized metal sheet and strip, and 
particularly to improved methods and electrolytes 
for providing electrogalvanized steel sheets and 
strip having enhanced surface smoothness essentially 
free of "mounds" caused by metal oxides occluded in 
the electrodeposited metal coating. Manufacture of lustrous iron-zinc 
electrodeposited coatings on metal substrates is 
described in Salt, U.S. Patent No. 2,778,787. In 
that patent, such deposits are obtained from an 
electrolyte bath containing chlorides of iron, zinc, 
ammonia and potassium and, for example, 0.5 g/l of 
citric acid which furnishes ferric ion with a 
chelate group, thereby preventing precipitation of 
ferric hydroxide from the bath. In an article entitled "Development of 
Zn-Fe Alloy Electroplating With Soluble Anode in 
Chloride Bath," 4th AES Continuous Strip Plating 
Symposium, Chicago, Ill., May 13, 1984, Irie et al., 
describe a similar process using soluble anodes and 
with addition of citric acid (amount not specified)  
 
to prevent precipitation of ferric hydroxide from an 
electrolyte bath containing chlorides of iron, zinc 
and ammonia. Japanese published application No. 
59/211594 discloses the production of Zn-Fe 
electroplated steel sheets wherein the deposited 
coating contains 7-35 weight percent Fe and is 
chemically single-phase. Examples of electrolyte 
baths contain chlorides of iron, zinc, ammonia and 
either ammonium citrate, 5 g/l, or citric acid, 
2 g/l, together with sodium acetate, 10 g/l, and 
wherein plating was performed at 50°C (122°F) and a 
pH of 3. U.S. Patent No. 4,540,472 discloses the 
electrodeposition of Zn-Fe alloy coatings from an 
electrolyte bath containing chlorides of zinc, iron 
and potassium, together with an amount of sulfate 
ion, an adduct such as a polyethylene glycol, and a 
chelating agent such as citric acid in an amount 
from 0.5 g/l to 5 g/l. In accordance with one aspect the present 
invention provides a method of producing on an elongated 
steel strip base a substantially mound-free 
electroplated coating of zinc-iron alloy by passing said 
steel strip through an electrolyte bath comprising 
chloride ions and a soluble anode source of iron and 
zinc ions, said method being characterized by 
substantially preventing the scaling of iron oxide 
particles from the iron-containing anode and maintaining 
the maximum amount of total solids in the bath at about 
0.5 grams per liter of the bath during electroplating of 
the coating by adding to the
