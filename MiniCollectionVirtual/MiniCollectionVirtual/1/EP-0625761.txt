<ABSTRACT>
Data processing method and apparatus for 
converting data such as character data or image data of 

a resolution X into data of a resolution Y which are 
effective for use in, particularly, a recording 

apparatus such as an ink jet printer or the like. The 
data processing method comprises a first dividing step 

of dividing the data of the resolution X in the main-scan 
direction every A bits; a first converting step of 

converting the divided A-bit data into the B-bit data 
of the bit number B by using a first conversion pattern 

table; a second dividing step of dividing the data 
which was obtained by repeating the conversion by the 

first converting step by a number of times as many as a 
plurality of lines in the sub-scan direction every A 

bits; a second converting step of converting the 
divided A-bit data into the B-bit data of the bit 

number B by using a second conversion pattern table; 
and a reducing step of reducing the data of the 

resolution Y obtained by the second converting step by 
a thinning process by using a third conversion pattern 

table.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to data processing method
and apparatus for converting a resolution and a
magnification of input data and, more particularly, to
data processing method and apparatus which are
effective to an ink recording apparatus using a member
to be conveyed such as paper, cloth, or special sheet
as a member on which a liquid-like deposition material
such as ink, ink which is obtained by setting the solid
ink into a dissolved state, or toner which is obtained
by dissolving fine particles was held and which can be
applied to recording apparatuses such as copying
apparatus, facsimile apparatus, and the like, a
communicating apparatus, a business machine, a
composite apparatus, a printer, and the like.Generally, in a recording apparatus which is
connected to a host computer or the like and records
and generates an image, image data comprising binary
data which was binarized on the host computer side or
character image data comprising character code
information is received and generated as an image.The image data falsely expresses a half tone image
by a binary signal. A multivalue image signal is 
converted into a binary signal for deciding an on/off
state of each dot which forms a pixel by using a dither
matrix in which, for example, 16 threshold values are
arranged in a two-dimensional plane of (4 x 4) by a
dither method or the like. Due to this, even in case
of the binary signal, a half tone image without a
pseudo outline can be reconstructed.As for character image data, a character code is
sent to a recording apparatus and the recording
apparatus develops a character pattern according to a
character code in the apparatus and generates a
character image. Generally, the character pattern has
a pattern construction according to a resolution of the
recording apparatus.The resolution of the recording apparatus differs
in dependence on a recording method. A resolution of
the image data comprising the pseudo half tone image
data which was processed by the host computer doesn't
always coincide with the resolution of the recording
apparatus. For example, when the resolution of the
image data is lower than the resolution of the
recording apparatus, an image which is generated is
smaller than a desired size. Therefore, an enlargement
converting process is needed.That is, in order to commonly possess image data
by a plurality of apparatuses having different
resolutions, a resolution converting process to convert 
the image size (the number of pixels) is necessary.A variable magnification process is needed
