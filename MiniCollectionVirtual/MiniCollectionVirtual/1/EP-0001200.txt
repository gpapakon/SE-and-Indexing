<ABSTRACT>
The method involves secluded handling of blood samples. 
The device for performing the method comprises a container 

adapted to contain a blood sample and a so-called 
phase body (4) inserted into the container beforehand, which 

after centrifugal treatment of the container separates the 
phases of the blood from each other. The container consists of 

a tube length (1) each end of which is closed by one pierceable, 
self-sealing closure (2 and 3 resp.). The blood sample is 

introduced by means of e.g. a cannula (5) through the one 
closure (2) and one of the blood phases formed during centrifugation 

is removed through the other closure (3) by means 
of e.g. a cannula.
