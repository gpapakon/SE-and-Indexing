<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reagent for classification
and counting immature cells contained in a liquid sample
such as blood.Various blood cells such as erythrocytes, leukocytes
and platelets are included in peripheral blood of normal
subject. The blood cells are produced in a bone marrow and
transferred to a blood stream, while growing in accordance
with differentiating themselves from immature cells.For example, leukocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils
and basophils are differentiated from immature cells
to mature cell through (myeloblast → promyelocyte → myelocyte
→ metamyelocyte) to (stab cell → segmented cell).
In a peripheral blood collected from a normal subject,
immature cells such as myeloblasts, promyelocytes, myelocyte
and metamyelocyte do not appear and stab cells are a small
number. However, immature leukocytes appear in some specific 
cases of, for example, bloods collected from patients
suffering blood diseases such as leukemia, metastasis of
cancer to bone marrow and severe infectious disease. Thus,
it is important and significant to measure immature leukocytes
for diagnosis of such diseases.As one technique for an automated classification and
counting of blood cells, there is known a method of recording
images of cells and processing. In other case, blood
cells are automatically classified and counted by passing
them suspended in a diluent through an aperture and processing
signals obtained from the respective corpuscles. Lately,
the latter's flow system is preferably used in view of
accuracy, cost or the like.According to the flow system, blood cells are suspended
in a diluent, and detected by signals based on the respective
cells, for example, by signals based on the difference
in an optical property and an electric property. That is,
they may be detected by using a flow cytometry for detecting
scattered light or fluorescent light based on the difference
in an optical property, or by using a blood cell counter for
detecting electric signals generated from blood cells when
the blood cells pass through an aperture therein to which is
applied an electric current based on the difference in an
electric property. The latter can be further classified
into either a DC method for applying direct current to 
detect signals based on the difference in electric resistance
of blood cells and an RF method for applying high
frequency current in several MHz to detect signals based on
the difference in dielectric constant of blood cells. The
DC method detects signals sized in proportion to the
