<ABSTRACT>
Preparation of triphenylphosphine (TPP) by reaction of triphenylphosphine dichloride (TPPCl2) with magnesium, aluminium and/or iron in the presence of an inert solvent by employing a TPPCl2 solution whose content of phosgene, chlorine, diphosgene, hydrogen chloride, thionyl chloride, sulphuryl chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus oxychloride and/or aliphatic halogen compounds ("active chlorine compounds") in total is below 1000 ppm of Cl.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the continuous preparation of

solutions which are composed of an inert solvent and
TPPC1
2
 and whose content of phosgene, chlorine, diphosgene,
hydrogen chloride, thionyl chloride, sulfuryl

chloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus oxychloride
and/or aliphatic halogen compounds (active chlorine

compounds) is less than 1000 ppm Cl by reacting triphenylphosphine
oxide (TPPO) with phosgene in the inert

solvent, wherein

a) the TPPO-containing solution and the phosgene are
passed countercurrently through one or more reaction

vessels R arranged in series,
b) the TPPO solution introduced into the system is
enriched, in an upstream scrubber column W, with

phosgene from the phosgene countercurrent under
conditions such that the phosgene dissolves, and the

CO
2
 stream which may still contain some phosgene is
removed from the scrubber column, and
c) the solution which leaves the last of the reaction
vessels R is transferred into a distillation column

D from which the phosgene and the active chlorine
compounds are removed together with part of the

solvent by distillation, this mixture being returned
to the last reaction vessel in which the fresh

phosgene is also introduced countercurrently to the
solution, and the TPPCl
2
 solution being removed from
the bottom part of D.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the TPPO
and the phosgene flow cocurrently through the apparatuses

R. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
reaction of TPPO with phosgene is carried out in the

presence of a phosgenation catalyst.
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein an
N,N-disubstituted formamide is used as phosgenation

catalyst.
A process for preparing triphenylphosphine,
wherein the active chlorine compounds in the TPPCl
2

solution obtained as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 are
separated off in the distillation column D at from 130 to

175Â°C and the solution is subsequently reacted in the
presence of aluminum to form triphenylphosphine.
