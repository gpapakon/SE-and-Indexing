<ABSTRACT>
A frequency surveillance method for monitoring background atmospheric noise levels in unoccupied channels in an operating frequency band of a high frequency communication system. In the method, the unoccupied channels are scanned a number of times to obtain analogue signals. The obtained signals are transformed to a digital form and averaged. The averaged digital signals are filtered to remove substantially all radio frequency interference. Absolute signals are then produced by scaling or comparing the filtered signals with a known noise level. The background noise levels are obtained by further averaging the absolute signals. A visual display unit is used to display the background noise levels as functions of frequencies. A frequency surveillance apparatus is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
HF BACKGROUND NOISE MEASUREMENT IN HF ENVIRONMENTSThis invention relates to frequency surveillance systems and in particular to a method and apparatus for determining the background atmospheric noise level in unoccupied channels in an operating band. In addition the invention relates to a system of selecting an appropriate operating frequency to minimise the effects of interference.It is well known by communicators using the high frequency (HF) bands that performance depends largely on frequency selection. This is due in large part to the vagaries of the Ionosphere. For HF skywave radars, or Over-the-Horizon Radars (OTHR), it is particularly important that the optimum frequency is chosen for the task at hand. This leads to a requirement for real-time frequency advice on a continuous basis.An HF system will normally consist of one or more antennas connected to one or more receivers. The antennas may be omnidirectional or may be physically arranged to have a degree of directionality. In addition, various analogue techniques can be used to form receiver beams having a defined direction and width. The signals from the antennas are often subjected to some degree of analogue filtering before reaching the receiver. The receiver output can be converted from analogue to digital form before undergoing further processing and analysis. Once in digital form phase weighting techniques can be used to form multiple simultaneous beams.It is an object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus for monitoring a frequency band and providing an indication of the background atmospheric noise levels in selected unoccupied channels.It is desirable to operate any HF system at the optimum signal to noise ratio. For an OTHR which relies on backscattered signals this translates to a requirement to select an operating frequency which is based on the clutter to noise ratio. Clutter refers to the signal backscattered from the earths surface.A number of sub-systems such as sounders provide information for determining the optimum operating frequency band for a given combination of ionospheric conditions. Once a frequency band has been selected however, 

 an unoccupied channel must be chosen in which to operate. This invention is designed to aid in this choice.Therefore, in one form of this invention, there is proposed a frequency surveillance system which monitors an entire frequency band on a continuous basis and provides an indication of the background environmental noise in the band.In a further form of this invention
