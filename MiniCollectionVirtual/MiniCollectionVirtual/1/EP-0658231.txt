<ABSTRACT>
There is described a water-proofing material (10) basically made from a plastic mass containing a liquid and particulate smectite clay, usually montmorillonite such as bentonite, which can be united with a carrier sheet (20). The plastic mass can contain aqueous and/or non-aqueous liquid which can be expelled after forming. The smectite clay can be a smectite liner intercalation complex and the mass is desirably formed by extrusion, in the latter case preferably during reaction of the clay and can have a density of at least 1000 kg/m-3 and can be 1 m or more wide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a waterproofing material suitable for waterproofing ponds, lakes, lagoons or comparable
sites whereby water is retained, or wherein waste is deposited and the ground beneath has to be protected
against leakage of aqueous or other liquid. The material can also be used in relation to water proofing structures,
covering contaminated land to prevent flow of water into such contaminated land and lining trenches which separate
contaminated areas from clear areas. The material can also be used as roofing material on flat or sloping roofs. Several
materials have been proposed in the past which include a layer of swellable smectite such as montmorillonite and/or
saponite incorporated'within the material to act as the sealing agent. The montmorillonite has been carried by a support
layer or base which has been provided in various ways. A support layer acts as protection but also gives additional
strength within the material.European patent number 59625 (CLEM) describes a waterproofing material which is a laminate comprising
a fabric base, particles of montmorillonite adhered to the base and a scrim adhered over the montmorillonite particles
to retain them on the base.In European patent application 246 311 (McGROARTY) a lower sheet comprises a base and montmorillonite
and an overlaid sheet comprises a base and montmorillonite. The bases are of solid plastics non-venting and impermeable
material so one of the bases forms a non-water transmissive layer between the two layers of montmorillonite,
thus giving a very good seal.However, the McGROARTY construction does have several practical difficulties. Firstly, the bases are made
from a thick, impervious and essentially solid plastics material, described in the specification as HDPE.Secondly, the granules of montmorillonite are adhered not only to the base but also to each other.Waterproofing materials of this kind are usually supplied in rolls and have to be unrolled and placed to lie in
the pond, lagoon or storage space. With the bases made from high density polyethylene the MCGROARTY material
is less flexible than when using a fabric (non-woven or woven) for the base. This means that the product is much more
difficult to handle and the montmorillonite is likely to crack during folding and unfolding. Further, because of the nature
of an HDPE plastic sheet the adhering of the montmorillonite to its surface is not easy. Quite large quantities of very
strong glue have to be used.A further waterproofing barrier material is disclosed in British

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a waterproofing material comprising mixing particulate smectite clay with a liquid, at least a
proportion of which is water, kneading the mixture to form a substantially homogeneous plastic mass, forming the

mass into a continuous layer (11;30) by extrusion, rolling or other means, uniting same with a carrier sheet
(12;20;51), and subjecting same

to a drying step by passing
through an oven (39) to remove liquid from the layer by evaporation.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein a proportion of said liquid is an alcohol having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms.
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein said alcohol is methanol, ethanol or propanol.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said liquid contains acrylate or polyacrylate.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said liquid contains glycerol or glycerine.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said liquid contains a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) compound.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the smectite containing layer (11;30) is sandwiched between
said carrier sheet (12;20;51) and a cover sheet (13;37;50).
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein reinforcement is provided in the smectite containing layer
A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein the reinforcement is secured to the cover sheet (13;37;50) and/or the
carrier sheet (12;20;51).
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the smectite layer (11;30) and the carrier sheet (12;20;51) are treated
after union to cause the layer to lose a degree of plasticity to enable it to be handled and stored without undergoing

significant deformation.
