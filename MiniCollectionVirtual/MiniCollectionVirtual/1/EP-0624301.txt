<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for processing image data operates in a high capacity mode or a high quality mode. In the former a single bit per pixel is created and processed along one of two identical processing paths (101, 101'). The processing paths involve compression, buffering and expansion for output to a writer interface (126, 126', 130). The processing path selected for pixels in each image frame is in accordance with the most available buffering memory. In the latter mode two bits per pixel, a more significant bit (MSB) and a less significant bit (LSB) are created and processed simultaneously along the two processing paths. The processing path for each is selected in accordance with the LSBs being processed by the processing path with the most available memory. As compression of the LSBs is not as efficient as that of the MSBs, the number of document pages stored in the compression buffers is maximized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus
and methods for processing of image data for non-impact
recording apparatus.In the prior art, it is known to use non-impact
recording apparatus that employ laser, LED,
thermal, ink-jet or other recording sources for
respectively recording images on an appropriate medium
by forming picture elements (pixels) of varying grey
shades. Typically, the recording apparatus includes
image processing means for generating a multibit image
digital signal (MIDS) for each pixel to be recorded.
In response to each MIDS, a pixel of a corresponding
size or density is recorded on the medium and a number
of pixels in the aggregate comprise a recording image
that may be viewed or transferred to another medium for
viewing. The recording apparatus may form a part of a
copier wherein a multipage document to be copied
includes an image scanner to transform the images on
the document to electrical signals representative
thereof. If multiple copies of the document are to be
made and printed in collated order without more than
one scan of each page of the original, it may be
necessary for the copier to store the image data for
all of the pages of the document. Where the stored
data is more than one bit per pixel, such storage
requirements may be excessive because of limited
available memory and the job may need to be broken up
differently through operator intervention. This is
true even though the copier may include image
compression circuits which can substantially reduce the
amount of memory required to store a job. It is therefore an object of the invention to
increase capacity of the recording apparatus while also
providing an ability to record very high quality images
when required. These and other objects and advantages
of the invention which will become apparent after
reading of the description of a preferred embodiment of
the invention are realized by a method and apparatus
for processing image data for recording in accordance with claims 1,3,8 and 12.FIG. 1 is a schematic of a printing apparatus
of the prior art;FIG. 2 is a block diagram of circuitry used
in forming a print head of the apparatus of FIG. 1 in
accordance with the prior art; andFIGS. 3, 3A, B and C represent a block
diagram of a printer control system which includes an
improved data processing circuit for processing data to
the driver circuit of the print head of FIG. 2 in
