<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fusion protein having epitopes
of at least two of the autoantigens glutamic acid

decarboxylase (GAD65), islet cell antigen (IA2) and
preproinsulin (PPINS) wherein said epitopes are connected

with a linker peptide. The fusion protein must be able to
bind to a solid phase.
The invention also concerns the cDNA, and a vector and cell
comprising said cDNA. Furthermore, this invention relates

to the use of said fusion protein in an immunoassay for the
simultaneous detection of autoantibodies related to

insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new fusion protein, its cDNA,
and a vector and a cell comprising said cDNA. Furthermore,
this invention relates to the use of said fusion protein in
an immunoassay for simultaneous detection of autoantibodies
related to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.The publications and other materials used herein to
illuminate the background of the invention, and in
particular, cases to provide additional details respecting
the practice, are incorporated by reference.GAD65, IA2 and insulin are pancreatic proteins produced by
the beta cells (for review see Atkinson and Maclaren 1993).
Autoantibodies to these proteins are detected in patients
with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and healthy
individuals at risk for developing the disease. More than
80 % of newly-diagnosed IDDM patients have antibodies
against at least one of these proteins (Baekkeskov et al.
1982). The risk of diabetes in relatives of IDDM patients
increases markedly when the number of autoantibodies
detected in the serum increases (Bingley et al. 1994; Verge
et al. 1994). In a group of high genetic risk, presence in
serum of antibodies to one or more of these autoantigens
predicted the disease onset accurately (Verge et al. 1996).
Also permanently healthy subjects (as regards IDDM) may
have temporarily or permanently antibodies against one of
the three antigens, but antibodies against multiple
antigens occur extremely rarely. It is therefore sought to
simultaneously determine reactivity against two or all 
three of the proteins, as the positivity for more than one
of these autoantibodies remarkably increases disease risk
(Bingley et al. 1994).GAD65 (Bu et al. 1992) has several epitopes recognised by
autoantibodies (Falorni et al. 1996). These are located
mostly at the center and C-terminus of the molecule whereas
the N-terminal quarter of the molecule is thought to
contribute to membrane docking of the protein, and to
contain few if any IDDM-informative epitopes (Falorni et
al. 1996).IA2 (also known as ICA512) (Rabin et al. 1994) is a
transmembrane protein with still unknown function. The
intracellular part of the molecule (IA2ic, about 40 kDa)
contains a domain with similarity to the active center of
protein phosphatases (Fischer et al. 1991), but no
enzymatic activity has been ascribed the IA2 molecule. The
informative epitopes of IA2 reside in the cytoplasmic
domain and herein they are concentrated at the C-terminal
half (Lampasona et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 1997).Insulin (Bell et al. 1980) is made by
