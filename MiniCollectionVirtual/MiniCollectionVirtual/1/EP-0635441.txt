<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor chain for conveying articles, especially a multi-layer mass stream of stick-shaped articles of the tobacco-processing industry, along a conveying zone. The links (1a to d) of the chain are connected to one another by means of joint pins (2, 3) which extend alternately perpendicularly to one another. Every second joint pin (2) is designed as a supporting pin which carries two running rollers (7) and a carrier plate (9) for the conveyed material. During movements of the chain, the running rollers (7) run down on a convexly curved guide rail and orient the surface of the carrier plates (9) horizontally. Further joint pins (3) project laterally from the joints and engage into a slot (23) which extends in the running surface of the guide rail. The advantage of this chain is that it moves a multi-layer mass stream of cigarettes or other stick-shaped articles along curved conveying zones reliably and carefully.

Conveying chain for conveying rod-shaped articles of the 
tobacco-processing industry transversely to their axis, in 

particular as a multi-layered mass flow, over a conveying 
section, the links of which are articulatedly interconnected and 

equipped with carrying pins which are arranged upright and at 

their upper end carry a carrying plate having a supporting 
surface, extending in a radial plane of the carrying pin, for the 

articles to be conveyed, characterised in that the joint pins 
(2,3) of successive joints (4, 6) extend perpendicularly to one 

another, in that every second joint pin (2) is designed as a 
carrying pin which projects out of the joint (4) at least on one 

side and has a carrying plate (9) pivotable in a plane radial to 
the axis of said carrying pin, in that the carrying pin (2) has 

at least one axial portion which projects out of the joint (4) 
and on which two running rollers (7) having substantially 

cylindrical circumferential surfaces extending concentrically to 
the carrying-pin axis are rotatably mounted, in that the 

circumferential surfaces of the running rollers (7) of each 
individual carrying pin (2), for the horizontal alignment of the 

supporting surface (11) of the carrying plates (9), can be 
brought by a tensile force acting on the chain to bear, for 

carrying the load of the articles to be conveyed, on two running 
surfaces (22), extending transversely to the running direction 

vertically above one another and in parallel, of a guideway (19) 
which is convexly curved at least in stretches, and in that 

horizontal joint pins (3), which project on both sides out of the 
joints (6) lying between the joints (4) having the carrying pins 

(2), are provided to project, in such a manner as to be 
displaceable in the conveying direction, into a slot (23) 

extending between the parallel running surfaces (22) of the 
guideway (19). 
Conveying chain according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
each carrying plate (9) has projections (14) and recesses (16) 

at the edges which are at the front and rear in the conveying  
 

direction, in that the projections and recesses of the front edge 
are laterally offset with respect to those of the rear edge, and 

in that the projections and recesses of successive carrying 
plates interdigitate with play to form a supporting surface for 

the articles to be conveyed. 
Conveying chain according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that each carrying plate (9) has on its underside a guide bar 

(17) which extends in the conveying direction beyond the profile 
of the supporting surface and, for the alignment of the carrying 

plate in the conveying direction, engages in a corresponding 
cutout (18) on the underside of the neighbouring carrying plate. 
Conveying chain according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the front faces, extending at a distance 

from and vertically above one another, of parallel rails (44) 
forming the guideway (19) are provided as the running surfaces, 

in that two running rollers (41) are rotatably mounted on the 
carrying pin (2), and in that each running roller has a 

substantially cylindrical running surface (42) for rolling on a 
rail (44) and a flange (43) for guiding the running roller along 

the rail. 
Conveying chain according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the supporting surfaces (11) of the 

carrying plates (9) form, in the conveying run of the chain, a 
surface which is substantially horizontal or rises or falls in 

the conveying direction, and in that both running rollers (7) of 
a carrying pin (2) bear and are guided, on one side, on two 

running surfaces (22), extending in a vertical plane above one 
another, of the guideway (19). 
Conveying chain according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the carrying plates (9) have on their 

supporting surface (11) hump-like elevations (46), extending 
transversely to the conveying direction, for aligning the 

conveyed articles transversely to their axis in changing curves.  
 
Conveying chain according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the running rollers (7) consist of a wear-resistant 

sintered material. 
Conveying chain according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the running rollers (7) of successive 

carrying pins (2) are designed and arranged to engage in the 
toothing (36) of a sprocket wheel (26). 
Conveying apparatus having a chain according to one of 
Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that a guideway (19), which 

defines the conveying section, extends, at least in portions, in 
a convexly curved manner, has two running surfaces (22,44) 

arranged vertically above one another and extending parallel to 
one another and a slot (23) extending between the running 

surfaces and parallel to them, is provided, in that the conveying 
chain is designed as an endless conveyor drivable in circulating 

fashion, in that the running rollers (7), for the horizontal 
alignment of the supporting surfaces (11) of the carrying plates 

(9), are pressed by a tensile force acting on the chain onto the 
running surfaces (22,44) of the guide rails (21,44) and upon 

movement of the chain roll on them in the conveying direction, 
in that the joint pins (3) engage, in such a manner as to be 

displaceable in the conveying direction, in the slot (23), and

opposite directions along the guide rail (21) are provided. 
Conveying apparatus according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that at least one running surface (22) of the guide rail (21) is 

interrupted in one section, in that a sprocket wheel (26), which
