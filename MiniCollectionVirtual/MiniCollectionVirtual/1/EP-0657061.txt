<ABSTRACT>
An insulating tape for the winding of an electric machine, in particular a rotary machine, consists of an electric breakdown-resistant material, such as mica, of a support material such as glass silk and of a thermoplastic adhesive for holding together the insulating tape. The adhesive consists of a thermoplastic material having a continued use temperature lower than the insulation class provided for the winding. The machine insulation has however the required mechanical and electric stability, after the winding insulation is impregnated with an hardenable resin.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a winding of the heat
resistance class H or C according to IEC 85 for an

electric machine,

in which firstly an insulating tape is produced, which
consists of a backing material in the form of glass

silk, an adhesive and an electric breakdown-resistant
material such as mica,
wherein the adhesive, which is present in liquid form
using a solvent, is firstly applied either to a layer of

backing material or the layer of electric breakdown-resistant
material or to both layers, the two layers are

connected together and the connected layers are then
subjected to heat treatment,
in which the insulating tape produced in this way is
wound round an electric conductor and then impregnated

with an impregnating resin, which consists of a mixture
of an epoxy resin and an isocyanate resin,
and in which the impregnated winding is cured,

characterised in that

a thermoplastic adhesive of a polyurethane or a
saturated polyester is used as the adhesive.
A process according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the adhesive is mixed with an accelerating agent prior
to application to the layer of backing material or to

the layer of electric breakdown-resistant material.
A process according to claim 1,

characterised in that

an accelerating agent is applied to the insulating tape
separately from the adhesive. 
A process according to claim 2 and claim 3,

characterised in that

tertiary amines, imidazoles, quaternary ammonium salts,
Lewis acids, Lewis bases, phosphonium salts,

piperazines, organometallic compounds or a mixture of
two or more of these substances are used as accelerating

agent.
