<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices containing liquid 
crystal oligomeric siloxane materials. Polymeric liquid crystals consisting of a siloxane 
backbone and a mesogenic portion are known, see for example 
E.P. 029 162 which discloses the preparation of such 
polymers by the addition of a polysiloxane having silicon-bonded 
hydrogen atoms to vinyl-substituted mesogenic 
molecules. More recently chiral smectic liquid crystal 
materials having ferroelectric properties have been 
described, see for example JP 01144491 which discloses 
materials containing 
 
in which Me represents methyl, R represents an optically 
active alkyl or aralkyl group, m = 0 to 5 and n = 2 to 10. Desirable properties of ferroelectric liquid crystals 
include a low viscosity and a relatively high tilt angle 
which is also substantially independent of temperature. 
Low viscosities are related to reduced response times and 
are advantageous when a dye is to be incorporated into the 
liquid crystal material. A high tilt angle is advantageous 
with regard to the electro-optic properties of the liquid 
crystal. In a device based on birefringence effects the 
tilt angle is normally 22.5° whereas devices incorporating 
dyes require an angle greater than this for good optical 
contrast. Measurements of the tilt angle of liquid crystal 
materials of the kind disclosed in JP 01144491 have shown 
not only a variation from polymer to polymer but also a 
reduction of the tilt angle with increasing temperature. We have now surprisingly discovered that a certain 
narrowly defined group of oligomeric liquid crystal  
 
materials exist as neat compounds or in mixtures which 
exhibit relatively high tilt angles and that such angles 
are substantially independent of temperature over a broad 
temperature range including ambient. Accordingly this invention provides a liquid crystal 
device wherein the liquid crystal material is a siloxane-containing 
compound having the general formula 
 
wherein R represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 10 
carbon atoms or the group 
 
each R' represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon 
atoms, T is 
 
X represents an alkyl or halogen-substituted alkyl group 
having at least one chiral centre, Y represents a fluorine 
atom, m has a value of 0, 1 or 2 and n has a value of 10, 
11 or 12. In the general formula of the liquid crystal material 
employed according to this invention R represents an alkyl 
group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, for example methyl, 
propyl, hexyl or decyl, and each R' may be
