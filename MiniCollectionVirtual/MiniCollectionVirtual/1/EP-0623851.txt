<ABSTRACT>
A processing rack (15) for holding a plurality of 
exposed film cartridges (16) from which the respective 

filmstrips of each cartridge may be unwound to provide 
full extension thereof to facilitate processing and 

wound back into the cartridges (16) by selective operation of 
a reversible drive mechanism that engages the spool of 

each film cartridge. The rack comprises a plurality of 
cartridge engaging clamps (201-20n) and elongated guide rods (501-50n) 

for receiving the respective plurality of cartridges in 
driving relation with the drive mechanism for unwinding 

and winding the respective filmstrips from and into each 
such cartridge (16). The cartridge engaging clamps (201-20n) are also 

loosely attached to respective weighted clips (601-60n) which 
engage the leading end (19) of each of the filmstrips as each 

such leading end is unwound from the cartridge and are 
released by thrust forces applied by the leading ends of 

the filmstrips as they are unwound. The weighted clips (601-60n) 
each have guide brackets that loosely engage guide rods 

attached to the respective cartridge engaging clamps (201-20n) so 
that they move along the guide rods during unwinding. 

After processing of the filmstrips is complete, they are 
rewound back into the cartridges (16), and the leading ends 

are detached from the weighted clips as they are 
re-engaged by the cartridge engaging clamps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of processing 
exposed photographic film and more particularly to a 
method and apparatus for automatically withdrawing an 
exposed filmstrip from its cartridge, tensioning the 
withdrawn filmstrip during processing, and rewinding the 
processed filmstrip into the cartridge for further 
handling. Several techniques are employed in processing exposed 
rolls of positive and negative photographic film on a 
commercial scale. In a continuous processing method, in 
a darkroom or enclosure, the exposed filmstrips are 
withdrawn and severed from the cartridges, spliced 
together with other exposed filmstrips and slowly drawn 
through successive developing, rinsing and fixing 
solutions until processing is complete. In a further processing method, referred to as "dip 
and dunk", the exposed filmstrips are withdrawn and 
severed from the cartridges and clipped at one end to a 
rack. Weights are attached to the free ends of the 
filmstrips so that gravity operates to tension the 
filmstrips as they hang downward from the rack during 
immersion in the processing solutions. When all of the 
filmstrips have been attached to the rack and weighted, 
the rack is successively suspended over the tanks 
containing the developing, fixing and rinsing solutions 
and then lowered to lower the weighted filmstrips into 
each such solution. The removal of the filmstrips from the cartridges 
and attachment to the racks, and the attachment of the 
free hanging weights, requires care and is time 
consuming. After processing is complete, the removal of  
 
the filmstrips from the rack, the weights from the free 
ends and the handling of the processed filmstrips also 
require labor. After either type of processing is complete, in the 
case of negative film types, the filmstrips may be 
spliced together or separately drawn through the 
printing stations of printers in which the images in the 
frames are exposed onto positive print media from which 
prints are made. In the case of positive film, the 
filmstrip image frames may be cut apart and mounted as 
"slides". Eventually, negative filmstrips are typically 
cut into envelope sized segments so they can be provided 
to the consumer within a typical package containing the 
prints made from the negative images. Recently, it has been recognized that there are 
certain advantages to retaining the negative filmstrip 
with its cartridge through processing and printing, 
particularly so that it can be protected between these 
operations and can be

<CLAIMS>
A processing rack for holding a plurality of 
film cartridges from which the respective filmstrips of 

each cartridge may be unwound to provide full extension 
thereof to facilitate processing and wound back into the 

cartridges by selective operation of a reversible drive 
mechanism, the processing rack comprising: 

   a plurality of cartridge engaging means for 
receiving the respective plurality of cartridges in 

driven relation with said drive mechanism for unwinding 
the filmstrip from and winding the filmstrip into each 

such cartridge, each cartridge engaging means having 
first guide means for directing the leading end of each 

such filmstrip as it is unwound from the cartridge into 
an engagement position and second guide means for 

guiding movement of the filmstrip as it is unwound from 
the cartridge to full extension thereof and wound into 

the cartridge; and 
   a like plurality of leading end engaging means 

coupled to said second guide means for attachment to the 
leading end of each such filmstrip when the leading end 

thereof is directed into the engagement position and for 
restraining lateral movement and contact of the 

elongated filmstrips during extension thereof. 
The processing rack of Claim 1 further 
comprising: 

   a plurality of second guide means each extending 
from a respective cartridge engaging means in side by 

side orientation for loosely engaging and guiding the 
leading end engaging means during further unwinding and 

extension of the elongated filmstrips from the
