Process for the preparation of a multilayer 
protective and/or decorative coating on a substrate 

surface, in which 

(1) a pigmented aqueous basecoat which contains a 
polyacrylate resin as binder is applied to the 

substrate surface, the polyacrylate resin being 
obtainable by polymerization of (a) a mixture of 

esters of methacrylic acid and/or esters of 
acrylic acid, together if required with (b) 

further monomers different from (a) or mixtures of 
such monomers, 
(2) a polymer film is formed from the basecoat applied 
in stage (1), 
(3) a transparent topcoat is applied to the resulting 
basecoat and subsequently 
(4) basecoat and topcoat are baked together, 
 
characterized in that the polyacrylate resin contained 

in the pigmented aqueous basecoat can be obtained by 
employing as component (a) a mixture of esters of 

methacrylic acid and/or esters of acrylic acid, which 
contains furfuryl acrylate and/or furfuryl 

methacrylate. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that component (a) contains furfuryl methacrylate. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that component (a) contains a quantity 

of furfuryl acrylate and/or furfuryl methacrylate such 
that the proportion of furfuryl acrylate and/or 

furfuryl methacrylate, based on the total weight of (a) 
+ (b) = 100% by weight, is 0.25 to 10% by weight,  

 
preferably 1.0 to 9.0% by weight and particularly 

preferably 2.0 to 7.0% by weight. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the pigmented aqueous basecoat 

contains a metallic pigment, preferably an aluminium 
pigment, or a mixture of metallic pigments. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the pigmented aqueous basecoat 

contains a pearlescent pigment or a mixture of 
pearlescent pigments. 
Aqueous paints which contain a polyacrylate 
resin as binder, the polyacrylate resin being 

obtainable by polymerization of (a) a mixture of esters 
of methacrylic acid and/or esters of acrylic acid, 

which contains furfuryl acrylate and/or furfuryl 
methacrylate, together if appropriate with (b) further 

monomers different from (a), or mixtures of such 
monomers, characterized in that they contain a metallic 

pigment or a mixture of metallic pigments and/or a 
pearlescent pigment or a mixture of pearlescent 

pigments. 
Aqueous paints according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that they contain an aluminium 

pigment. 
Aqueous paints according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that component (a) contains furfuryl 

methacrylate. 
Aqueous paints according to one of Claims 6 to 
8, characterized in that component (a) contains a 

quantity of furfuryl acrylate and/or furfuryl 
methacrylate such that the proportion of furfuryl 

acrylate and/or furfuryl methacrylate, based on the 
total weight of (a) + (b) = 100% by weight, is 0.25 to  

 
10% by weight, preferably 1.0 to 9.0% by weight and 

particularly preferably 2.0 to 7.0% by weight.
