<ABSTRACT>
A multi-element surgical drape includes a bottom 
sheet that is placed over a patient and a top sheet that 

is reversibly secured to the bottom sheet. The two sheets 
each have a fenestration, and the fenestrations are 

aligned to provide access to the surgical site. After the 
surgical procedure has been completed the two sheets are 

separated. The top sheet is contaminated ("red-bag") 
medical waste, while the bottom sheet can be disposed of 

as non-contaminated waste, recycled, or processed for 
reuse. The invention permits a substantial reduction in 

the volume of red-bag waste generated by surgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical drapes; more
particularly, to multi-element drapes that can be
separated after use into contaminated and non-contaminated
elements.Surgical drapes are used to maintain a sterile field
in the vicinity of a surgical site, in order to prevent
infection or contamination. In the process of use, a
surgical drape becomes contaminated with blood and other
body fluids. The contaminated drapes must be carefully
segregated, so that they do not spread pathogens into the
environment. Used disposable drapes must be "red-bagged;"
i.e., maintained separately from non-contaminated waste.
With the increasing concern regarding the potential
environmental and waste disposal problems posed by
contaminated medical waste, disposing of red-bag waste in
an acceptable manner is becoming increasingly expensive.
There is thus an incentive to reduce the amount of
contaminated waste generated by surgical procedures (See,
e.g., Tieszen ME and Gruenberg JC, "A Quantitative,
Qualitative, and Critical Assessment of Surgical Waste,"
JAMA 267, 2765 [May 27, 1992]).A number of patents disclose inventions that relate
to the present invention. U.S. Patent 4,024,862, issued
on May 24, 1977, to R.F. Colins, discloses a drape that
includes auxiliary elements. Specifically, a conventional 
surgical drape includes a fenestration that is large
enough to perform an enlarged surgical procedure, but the
fenestration is covered by one or more "frame sheets"
removably secured to the upper surface of the drape around
the fenestration. The frame sheet has a smaller
fenestration aligned with the large fenestration in the
drape. Thus a reduced surgical procedure may be performed
through the fenestration of the frame sheet or,
alternatively, the frame sheet can be removed in order to
perform the enlarged procedure.U.S. Patents, 4,316,455 and 4,316,456, issued on
February 23, 1982, to W.K. Stoneback, disclose a draping
system designed to reduce the inventory that a hospital
must stock. The system makes use first of a small drape
that is placed in contact with the patient and that
includes a fenestration for placement over the operative
site. Thereafter, a large "standardized" top sheet is
placed over the bottom drape. The larger top drape,
which has a fenestration that is larger than that of the
bottom drape but smaller than the outer periphery of the
bottom drape, is positioned so that the fenestrations are
aligned. The top drape is then secured to the bottom
drape.U.S. Patent 4,476,860, issued on October 16, 1984, to
R.F.

<CLAIMS>
A multi-element surgical drape, comprising

a) a bottom sheet (12) for placement over a patient and
comprising


i) a bottom surface for contacting the patient,
ii) a top surface for facing away from the patient after placement,
iii) attachment receptor means (36, 36A) on the top surface, and
iv) a fenestration (34); and
b) a top sheet (14) comprising

i) a bottom surface facing the bottom sheet (12) and a top surface facing
away from the bottom sheet,
ii) attachment means (26, 26A) on the bottom surface that attach to the
receptor means (36, 36A) on the bottom sheet to removably secure the top sheet (14) to

the bottom sheet (12), and
iii) a fenestration (24) smaller than, and aligned, with the fenestration (34) in
the bottom sheet (12); characterised in that the drape further comprises
c) a pouch (16, 16') on the top surface of the top sheet, near the
fenestration, for collecting fluid runoff during surgery, the pouch comprising


i) a top edge (D) and a bottom edge (C) joined by two opposing side edges
(A, B), the side edges and a bottom edge being sealed closed,
ii) means (42, 46) for detachably sealing the top edge (D) to permit opening
the pouch (16, 16') to receive fluid and then closing the pouch to prevent leakage of the

fluid.
The surgical drape of claim 1 in which the attachment receptor means (36) is a
release layer and the attachment means (26) is a releasable adhesive.
The surgical drape of claim 1 in which the attachment receptor means (36A) and
attachment means (26A) in combination form a hook-and-loop fastener system. 
The surgical drape of any preceding claim in which the bottom sheet (12) further
comprises guide means (38) to indicate a preselected position on the top surface and the

top sheet (14) is placed in the preselected position.
The surgical drape of any preceding claim in which the top edge (D) of the
pouch (16) has a flexible surface that may be pressed against a facing surface and the

means for detachably sealing comprises a raised ridge (42) on one surface for sealingly
engaging a corresponding channel (46) on the other surface.
The surgical drape of any preceding claim in which the pouch (16) further
comprises a sealable drainage port (48) through which fluid may be drained from the

pouch.
The method of draping and undraping a surgical patient comprising the step of:

a) securing a top sheet (14, 60) to a bottom sheet (12, 50), wherein

i) the bottom sheet (12, 50) comprises a fenestration (34, 56) and an
attachment receptor means (36, 36A, 54) that surrounds the fenestration and
ii) the top sheet (14, 60) comprises

1) a bottom surface facing the bottom sheet (12, 50) and a top surface
facing away from the bottom sheet,
2) attachment means (26, 26A, 62) on the bottom surface that attaches to
the receptor means (36, 36A, 54) on the bottom sheet to accomplish the securing

together of the sheets, and
3) a fenestration (24, 66) smaller than, and aligned with, the fenestration
(34, 56) in the bottom sheet; characterised in that the method comprises the further steps

of
b) separating and removing the top sheet (14, 60) from the bottom sheet
(12, 50) after the patient has undergone a surgical procedure;
c) removing the bottom sheet (12, 50) from the patient, and
d) identifying the top sheet (14, 60) for disposal and the bottom sheet (12,
50) for reuse or recycling.
