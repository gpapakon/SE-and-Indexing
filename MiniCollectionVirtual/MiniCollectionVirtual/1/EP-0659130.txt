<ABSTRACT>
An improved insulation system for vehicles and method of making and using the same are disclosed. The insulation system comprises one or more layers of insulative material (14) sealed within a case (12) which is impermeable to liquids while being at least in part moisture vapor permeable. When installed within a sealed vehicle where moisture vapor build-up is a problem, the insulation of the present invention serves to isolate condensed moisture from causing damage to the vehicle's contents or its shell. When moisture levels decrease within the vehicle, moisture is free to evaporate from the insulation and dissipate from the vehicle, thus reducing the vehicle's weight and the costs inherent in excessive moisture retention within a vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to insulation for vehicles, and 
especially to thermal and sound insulation installed within 
vehicles such as aircraft, trains, boats, automobiles and trucks. The demand for faster and more comfortable vehicles has 
resulted in many problems for vehicles designers. One such problem 
is that thermal and acoustical insulation must be carefully 
selected to make sure that the vehicles remain comfortable and 
relatively quiet under a wide range of environmental demands. 
These demands are particularly stringent in the design of aircraft 
which regularly undergo dramatic temperature changes and which must 
screen intense operational noise. Although not as extreme, other vehicles may also require 
considerable air-conditioning and acoustical insulation in order to 
comply with the demands of travelers or shippers. This is a 
growing concern in a variety of vehicles, such as high-speed 
trains, automobiles and trucks, and watercraft. Another constraint placed upon vehicles today is that faster 
vehicles generally require better sealing of seams and portals so 
as to minimize noise, maintain pressure differentials, and improve 
laminar flow around the shell of the vehicle. Unfortunately, since 
tightly sealed vehicle shells do not freely exchange air with the 
outside of the vehicle, heavy demands are placed upon the ability 
of air-conditioning systems to vent moisture out of the vehicles. Very tightly sealed vehicles, such as high-speed jet aircraft, 
can experience extensive moisture build-up in the passenger cabin 
from breath, perspiration, steam from foods, etc. When the 
exterior of such vehicles are at a lower temperature than the 
interior and/or undergo substantial changes in temperature, the 
moisture vapor in the interior air tends to condense against the  
 
shell or within insulation surrounding the shell. The build-up of moisture within insulation surrounding a 
vehicle's shell is a multi-faceted problem. First, many insulation 
materials commonly used today, such as fiberglass and certain 
foams, have a tendency to retain water once wetted. As a result, 
the insulation increases in its weight over time as condensate 
forms and remains within the insulation. In vehicles where 
increase in weight can result in substantial differences in fuel 
costs (e.g. aircraft), this build-up of moisture results in 
astronomical waste in fuel. With the steadily increasing costs of 
fuels, weight is further becoming a concern in virtually all forms 
of vehicles, including

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle insulation package (10) for use in a partially or completely 
sealed vehicle, comprising at least one layer of insulation material (14, 

50, 52), a case (12) completely surrounding the insulation material and 
sealed so as to form the insulation package (10), 
characterized in that
 
at least a portion of the case consists of a material (16, 48) which is 

both water repellent and moisture vapor permeable whilst the remaining 
case material (38, 40) is impermeable to moisture vapor transmission so 

that moisture vapor contained in air can pass freely in and out of the 
insulation package but liquid is prevented from permeating through the 

package. 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
water repellent and moisture vapor permeable material includes a 

laminate of breathable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane. 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in claim 2 wherein the 
laminate of PTFE membrane comprises a water repellent and moisture 

vapor permeable fabric including the laminate of breathable polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE) membrane. 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in claim 3 wherein the 
laminate of breathable PTFE membrane comprises an expanded 

microporous lattice of PTFE nodes interconnected by fibrils. 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 4 
wherein a first surface (16) of the case (12) is formed of the water 

repellent moisture vapor permeable material and a second surface (18) of 
the case (12), opposing the first surface (16), consists of the material 

impermeable to moisture vapor transmission.  
 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 4 
wherein two opposing surfaces (16, 48) of the case (12) are formed of 

the water repellent and moisture vapor permeable material. 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 6 
wherein multiple layers of insulation material are provided within the

barrier material (54) is arranged between the two opposing surfaces (16, 

48) forming two spaces within the insulation package which are filled 
with the insulation material. 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 8 
wherein the insulation material is readily moisture vapor permeable. 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in claim 9 wherein the 
insulation material which is moisture vapor permeable includes a 

breathable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). 
The vehicle insulation package as claimed in claim 9 wherein one of 
the two spaces is filled with an open cell insulation material and the 

other of the two spaces is filled with a fibrous insulation material.

insulation package covers an interior surface of an outer shell (24) of the 
vehicle. 
A partially or completely sealed vehicle with a vehicle insulation 
package according to claim 5 wherein the vehicle insulation package 

covers an interior surface of an outer shell (24) of the vehicle, the water 
repellent and moisture vapor permeable first surface (16) of the case
