<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for improving the 
processes in leather treatment, and more particularly to the use of 
selected polymers to improve the wringing, splitting and shaving 
steps in leather treatment. Animal hides and skins are converted into useful leather by 
processing involving both wet and dry operations. The wet 
operations include trimming and sorting, soaking, fleshing, 
unhairing, bating, pickling, tanning, wringing, splitting and 
shaving, retanning, coloring, fatliquoring and setting out. Some of 
these steps put the hide or skin into the proper condition for a 
subsequent processing step. Others of these steps affect major 
changes in the properties or appearance of the hide or skin. Each 
step in the processing is interrelated with one or more of the other 
steps in the processing. Typically, leather is produced from hide which is first pickled 
and then tanned and neutralized. The tanned stock is subsequently 
wrung to remove excess moisture from tanned stock so that it can 
be properly handled on the splitting and shaving machines which 
follow to adjust the thickness of the tanned stock to that required 
for the end use. Chromium salts are often used to tan hides because a stable 
hide is produced. When the chrome-tanned leather is subsequently 
split and shaved, however, residual waste is produced which 
contains some of the chromium salts. Some tanneries now attempt 
to complete the mechanical splitting and shaving operations before 
the hide is subjected to the chrome tanning so that the residual 
waste will not contain any chromium salts. These tanneries 
however experience difficulties because hides which have not yet  
 
been chrome tanned are characteristically sticky causing the hides to 
stick to the processing machinery used to split and shave them. Our 
invention permits the tannery to overcome this sticking problem if 
it chooses to split and shave the hides before chrome tanning. 
Furthermore, our invention improves the splitting and shaving 
steps even if the chrome tanning step is completed before the 
splitting and shaving steps. We have discovered that the use of a dispersion of a selected 
amphiphilic copolymer formed from a predominant amount of at 
least one hydrophobic monomer and a minor amount of at least 
one copolymerizable hydrophilic monomer in the pretanning and 
tanning step improves moisture release in the wringing step and 
improves thickness adjustment in the splitting and shaving steps of 
leather treatment. A method of the present
