<ABSTRACT>
A PAL wide aspect ratio luminance signal is transmitted in letterbox format with a main signal component occupying the central part of the vertical scan and a helper signal occupying the top and bottom borders. The input signal is sampled at 4/3 x 2fsc and is split into the two parts so that low horizontal frequency components are transmitted at 2fsc in the main component and high horizontal frequency components, e.g. above fsc, in the borders. The border signals are multiplexed up to 2fsc and preferably are frequency inverted. The main signal occupies three-quarters of the number of lines and the borders comprise the remaining one quarter. The resultant 2fsc signal can be applied to the luminance input of a phase segregated Weston PAL decoder for transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN TELEVISION SYSTEMSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates- to apparatus for and methods of transmitting and receiving television signals, and particularly to the transmission of improved-quality television signals compared with those provided by the present-day transmission systems.The invention could be applied to the NTSC system or to other systems, but will be described for convenience with reference to the PAL system and more particularly with reference to a system using a 16:9 picture aspect ratio. The signal can be displayed on a special 16:9 aspect ratio receiver, or can be displayed on an existing 4:3 aspect ratio receiver with what is known as a "letterbox" display.In a letterbox display, illustrated in Figure 24, the wide aspect ratio image is displayed with full horizontal width in the vertically central part of the screen, and the top and bottom of the picture are blanked off to black. This subjective effect is sometimes seen already when wide-screen cinematographic films are transmitted by broadcast television.It is already known in a 625/50/2:1 standard PAL transmission system to transmit 432 active lines which are then displayed on a 4:3 aspect ratio receiver in letterbox format. To display the picture on a 16:9 aspect ratio receiver the picture can be expanded vertically by increasing the vertical scan of the raster. This however results in the lines being further apart on the screen, and becoming visible, which is quite the opposite of the effect desired, namely to improve the subjective image quality. There is also less definition in the horizontal direction.Another proposal includes black bars at the top and bottom of the picture to include additional information so as to give more vertical detail. Related to this, United Kingdom Patent Application GB-A-2 213 342 describes the transmission of the picture in letterbox format on a reduced number of lines, with low-amplitude non-visible additional information being transmitted in blanked-off areas at the top or bottom of the picture. 

 Other prior documents in this field include the following, united Kingdom Patent Application GB-A-2 186 165 describes a CRT (cathode ray tube) display device which displays wide aspect ratio signals on a conventional display by reducing the scanning amplitude of the scanning raster. This however requires a modification to the CRT circuitry of the existing receiver.United Kingdom Patent Application GB-A-2 203 Oil describes a transmitter which includes also a decoder like that at
