<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit arrangement for detecting adjacent-channel interference in a stereo broadcast receiver in which a stereo multiplex signal is present, a signal indicating the adjacent-channel interference (adjacent-channel interference signal) is derived in dependence on a direct-voltage component and in dependence on spectral components above 60 kHz.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for detecting adjacent channel
interference in a stereo broadcast radio receiver

in which a stereo multiplex signal is present,

characterized in that
 first means (96) are
provided which, on the basis of a DC voltage

component of the stereo multiplex signal and on
the basis of spectral components above 60 kHz of

the stereo multiplex signal, derive a signal (DD3)
which indicates the adjacent channel interference.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 second means (2, 4, 5, 13)
for deriving a first auxiliary signal (SKU) are

provided if the DC voltage component of the stereo
multiplex signal is greater than a first reference

value (C3), 
in that
 third means (70) for forming a
second auxiliary signal (BHD) are provided if the

amplitudes of the spectral components above 60 kHz
of the stereo multiplex signal are greater than a

second reference value (HDT), and 
in that
 the
first means (96) subject the first and the second

auxiliary signal to an AND operation in order to
form the adjacent channel interference signal

(DD3).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,

characterized in that
 the second means (2, 4, 5,
13) comprise fourth means (2) for low-pass 

filtering the stereo multiplex signal, 
in that
 the
second means (2, 4, 5, 13) also comprise fifth

means (4, 5) for rectifying the low-pass filtered
stereo multiplex signal, and 
in that
 the second
means (2, 4, 5, 13) comprise a first comparator

(13) for comparing the rectified signal with the
first reference value (C3).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2 or 3,

characterized in that
 the third means (70)
comprise sixth means (101) for rectifying the

high-pass filtered stereo multiplex signal, 
in
that
 the third means (70) comprise seventh means
(102) for low-pass filtering the rectified stereo

multiplex signal, and 
in that
 the third means (70)
comprise a second comparator (107, 108, 109) for

comparing the low-pass filtered signal with the
second reference value (HDT).
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
adjacent channel interference signal (DD3) is

supplied to an integrator (81; 114, 116, 118, 120,
122), 
in that
 the adjacent channel interference
signal (DD3) changes to the value zero at the

start of adjacent channel interference, so that
the integrator is set to zero for the adjacent

channel interference signal (DD3), and 
in that
 the
adjacent channel interference signal (DD3) assumes

the level one again at the end of the adjacent
channel interference, whereupon the integrator

rises to the value one by integrating a constant
(AST5).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 5,

characterized in that
 the time constant of the
integrator (81; 114, 116, 118, 120, 122) is

smaller in the presence of adjacent channel interference 
than in the absence of adjacent channel

interference.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 6,

characterized in that
 the time constant of the
integrator (81; 114, 116, 118, 120, 122) is equal

to zero in the presence of adjacent channel interference.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 5, 6 or 7,

characterized in that
 the output signal from the
integrator (81; 114, 116, 118, 120, 122) is

supplied to a limiter (97).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 8,

characterized in that
 means (70, 71, 72, 73) for
deriving further signals (DD2) which represent the

reception quality are provided, 
in that
 means (81)
for logically combining the adjacent channel

interference signal (DD3) with these further
signals (DD2) are provided, and 
in that
 the
logically combined signal (AMU) produced thereby

is supplied to the limiter (97).
