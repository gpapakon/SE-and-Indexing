<ABSTRACT>
A camera using film means (2) including a storage medium for 
storing information, a film and a cartridge (1) accommodating the 

film, the camera comprising: means for drawing (12) the film from 
the cartridge; rewinding means (11) for rewinding the film to the 

cartridge; storage means (13,14) for causing information to be stored 
in the storage medium (5,7) in synchronization with the drawing 

operation; erasing means for erasing information stored in the 
storage medium; detection means (18) for issuing an alarm signal if 

it detects a fact that the quantity of the film drawn out by 
the drawing means (12) is less than a predetermined quantity; and 

control means for driving the erasing means (HE) so as to erase the 
information stored in the storage medium (5,7) in response to a 

fact that the alarm signal has been transmitted and that the 
film rewinding operation has been performed by the rewinding 

means (11). Therefore, even if the film has at all been incorrectly 
initially fed, the recording medium provided for the film is 

set to the non-record state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a camera which 
uses a film having a recording medium. Hitherto, there has been a cine camera arranged 
in such a manner that a magnetic medium is, as a 
magnetic track, formed in a photography film so as to 
be recorded/reproduced by a magnetic head provided in 
the camera. Therefore, it might be considered feasible to 
employ a structure of a still camera arranged in such 
a manner that a magnetic medium is formed in the film 
so as to record a variety of information items about 
the photography to the magnetic medium. In the case 
where the magnetic recording medium is provided as 
described above, an advantage can be obtained in that 
a larger quantity of the various information items 
about the photography can be recorded in comparison 
to a conventional optical imaging method. A film cartridge 1 shown in the upper portion 
of Fig. 1 is a film cartridge invented by the applicant 
of the present invention, the cartridge 1 accommodating 
a film 2. There are frames (frames to be subject to  
 
photographies) 4 and 6, to which the image of a subject 
is photographed, on the surface of the film 2. 
Furthermore, magnetic tracks 5 and 7 are respectively 
formed below the frames 4 and 6. The magnetic track 5 stores exclusive data 
about the frame 4, while the magnetic track 7 stores 
data about the frame 6. The other portion of the 
film 4 wound in the cartridge 1 are similarly 
arranged as for the relationship with the magnetic 
tracks. When data is recorded/reproduced from the 
magnetic tracks 5 and 7 thus arranged, two magnetic 
heads 13 and 14 are provided for, for example, on the 
back cover of the cartridge 1 in such a manner that 
the two magnetic heads 13 and 14 confront the magnetic 
tracks 5 and 7. In synchronization with feeding of the film 
2, a signal is supplied to the recording head 13 so 
that information is recorded to the surface of the 
magnetic track 5, while information recorded in the 
magnetic track 5 can be reproduced by monitoring 
the output from the reproduction head 14. A critical matter in the relationship between 
the magnetic tracks and the magnetic heads lies in 
that the magnetic head must equally positioned in 
contact with the magnetic track and that the surface 
of the magnetic head must be free from contamination  
 
or the like. If the above-described conditions are 
not satisfied, information cannot be correctly recorded 
and what is even worse it cannot be reproduced 
correctly. The degree of contact in which the 
magnetic head comes
