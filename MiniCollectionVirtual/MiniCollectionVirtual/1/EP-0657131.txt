<ABSTRACT>
There exists a catering dish for buffets which is substantially rectangular, is stackable with others one inside the other and consists of a uniform shell material, in which two transverse walls 4 and two longitudinal walls 5 project from a base 1, said walls merging into one another at corner regions 6 and bearing a peripheral gripping ledge 11 which protrudes outwards and forms prominent corners 12 in the corner regions 6, and in which the transverse walls 4 and the longitudinal walls are oriented outwards, widening the receptacle, and form an outwardly directed peripheral projection. It is desired for the catering dish to exhibit increased heat storability. This is achieved in that the dish material is porcelain. A dish made of porcelain has, owing to the material, a greater wall thickness than a dish made of high-grade steel, and the heat storability of porcelain is much better than that of high-grade steel.

A catering dish for buffets, being substantially rectangular, being 
stackable with others one inside the other and comprising a 

uniform dish material, wherein two transverse walls (4) and two 
longitudinal walls (5) project from a base (1), merge into one 

another at corner regions (6) forming defined corners (13) and 
carry a circumferential gripping rim (11) projecting outwards and 

forming defined corners (12) in the corner regions, wherein the 
width of the gripping rim (11) in the corner regions (6) is 

substantially equal to the width in the straight regions, wherein the 
transverse walls (4) and the longitudinal walls (5) are outwardly 

formed so as to widen the container, wherein the transverse walls 
and the longitudinal walls are slightly inclined in a lower insertion 

region, and wherein, when two dishes are stacked one inside the 
other, the upper dish has an inserted region in a receiving region of 

the lower dish, characterised in that the uniform dish material is 
porcelain and the transverse walls (4) and the longitudinal walls (5) 

form an outwardly extending circumferential projection (9), there 
being a degree of clearance between the receiving region of the 

lower dish and the inserted region of the upper dish, and in that 
the circumferential projection (9) is provided in the centre third of 

the wall height at the top of the slightly inclined insertion region.  
 
A catering dish according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
circumferential projection (9) is provided in the third sixth of the 

wall height, counted from the top. 
A catering dish according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
circumferential projection is formed as a step (9). 
A catering dish according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the transverse walls (4) and the longitudinal walls (5) are formed 

substantially vertically (10) above the circumferential projection 
(9). 
A catering dish according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the longitudinal walls (5) and the transverse 

walls (4) form a circumferential base support (2) at the bottom in 
the region of the base (1) by means of a curved recess (7). 
A catering dish according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the thickness of the gripping rim (11) is less 

than the thickness of the transverse walls (4) or the longitudinal 
walls (5).
