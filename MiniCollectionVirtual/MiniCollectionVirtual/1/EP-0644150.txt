<ABSTRACT>
A suspending apparatus is provided with a swing beam (10) 
rotatably supported in a horizontal plane, a swing beam 

driving linkage (20) comprising an oil hydraulic cylinder (22) and 
links (24,25) for moving the swing beam (10), a slide beam (30) slidably 

connected to the swing beam (10) for protruding from the free 
end of the swing beam (10), a slide beam driver (40) for moving the 

slide beam (30) along the swing beam (10), a motor driven chain 
block (50) movably mounted on the slide beam (30), a wireless 

controller (60) and a receiver (70) for actuating the swing beam (10) 
driving linkage (20), the slide beam driver (40) and the chain 

block (50) according to remote manipulation by wireless.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a suspending apparatus 
used for suspending and carrying objects, or for 
suspending and moving, for example, a wire feeder of 
welding equipment at the time of semi-automatic arc 
welding. Heretofore, there has been used, for example, a 
suspending apparatus provided with a swing beam disposed 
rotatably on a wall of a workshop house in a horizontal 
plane and a chain block mounted on the swing beam movably 
along the swing beam. In a case of carrying out semi-automatic 
arc welding by using the suspending apparatus, 
a wire feeder of welding equipment is hung from the 
chain block of the apparatus and welding work is 
performed as the wire feeder is moved according to the 
progression of the welding after shifting the wire feeder 
together with the chain block from a welding source 
disposed in the vicinity of a wall of the workshop house. 
Namely, the welding work is carried out as the wire 
feeder is moved together with the chain block within the  
 
rotatable range of the swing beam. In the above-mentioned conventional suspending 
apparatus, the movable area of the chain block is not so 
wide and a large force is required to rotate the swing 
beam and to move the chain block when the wire feeder is 
weighty. Accordingly, there has been a proposal to widen 
the movable area of the chain block by connecting a slide 
beam to the swing beam slidably in a longitudinal 
direction so as to extrude from the top end of the swing 
beam and to facilitate the rotation of the swing beam by 
disposing an electric motor for driving the swing beam 
in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,232,192. In the case of disposing the slide beam and the 
electric motor for driving the swing beam, however, there 
is the possibility that an operator is in danger at the 
time of rotational operation in the vicinity of the 
suspending apparatus. In addition to the above, there is a 
problem in that it is feared that the driving motor and 
the transmission system are damaged since considerable 
torque is applied to the driving motor and the 
transmission system for driving the swing beam at the 
time of, especially starting and stopping the rotation of 
the swing beam.  This invention is made to solve the 
aforementioned problems of the prior art, and it is an 
aim to provide a suspending apparatus which 
ensures the safety of the operator at the same 
time as realizing a laborsaving, moves the 
hoisting means such as the chain block in a wide range, 
and drives the swing beam without hindrance 
even if a

<CLAIMS>
A suspending apparatus comprising: 
   a swing beam rotatably mounted on a support in a 

horizontal plane; 
   a swing beam driving means disposed between the 

swing beam and the support for moving said swing beam 
swingingly; 

   a slide beam slidably connected to said swing beam 
for moving in a longitudinal direction of the swing beam; 

   a slide beam driving means for moving said slide 
beam along the swing beam; 

   a motor driven hoisting means movably mounted on the 
slide beam in a longitudinal direction of said slide beam 

for hoisting or lowering an object; 
   a wireless controller for transmitting control 

signals to control the swing beam driving means, the 
slide beam driving means and the motor driven hoisting 

means by wireless; and 
   a receiver for receiving the control signals 

transmitted from said wireless controller and for putting 
said swing beam driving means, said slide beam driving 

means and said hoisting means in or out of operation in 
response to said control signals. 
A suspending apparatus as set forth in claim 1, 
 

wherein said swing beam driving means consists of an oil 
hydraulic cylinder disposed on the swing beam, a first 

link rotatably connected to said swing beam at one end 
thereof, a second link rotatably connected to a top end 

of a cylinder rod of said oil hydraulic cylinder at one 
end thereof and rotatably connected to another end of 

said first link at a middle part thereof, and an eye 
plate secured to a base fixed on the support and 

rotatably connected to another end of said second link.
