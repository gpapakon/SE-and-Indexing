<ABSTRACT>
In order to spark-machine a workpiece (20) at points which are difficult of access, the invention calls for a flexible Bowden cable (8) to be used to transmit longitudinal displacements of the tailstock sleeve (2), which is mounted so that it can move longitudinally in the machining head, to an electrode (16) remote from the tailstock sleeve (2).

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the electroerosion of a work 
piece (20) in places to which access is difficult, 

having an erosion sleeve (2), which is arranged such 
that it is axially displaceable in an erosion head, and 

also having an erosion electrode (16) which is arranged 
at a distance from the erosion sleeve (2), wherein a 

flexible Bowden cable (8) is provided in order to 
transmit an axial displacement of the erosion sleeve 

(2) to the erosion electrode (16). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, having an 
erosion electrode (16) which is arranged in an 

electrode holder (14) which is guided in an axially 
displaceable manner in a guide element (12). 
Arrangement according to claim 2, having an 
electrically insulating guide element (12). 
Arrangement according to claim 2, the Bowden 
cable (8) of which arrangement is formed by means of a 

flexible spiral (7), in the interior of which extends a 
flexible cable (6) which is connected to the erosion 

sleeve (2).
