<DESCRIPTION>
 Cloning and Expression of Xylanase BThe present invention relates to the field of molecular biology. In particular, the present invention relates to the cloning and overexpression of a DNA sequence encoding a protein having the activity of the Aspergillus tubigensis xylanase B (XYL B) protein. The present invention also provides methods for the production and use of a single xylanase which is obtainable in a form which is free of other xylanases, and indeed from other enzymes in general.Background of the InventionThe composition of a plant cell wall is complex and variable. Polysaccharides are mainly found in the form of long chains of cellulose (the main structural component of the plant cell wall) , hemicellulose (comprising various Î²- xylan chains) and pectin. The occurrence, distribution and structural features of plant cell wall polysaccharides are determined by (1) plant species; (2) variety; (3) tissue type, (4) growth conditions; (5) ageing and (6) processing of plant material prior to feeding.Basic differences exist between monocotyledons (e.g. cereals and grasses) and dicotyledons (e.g. clover, rapeseed and soybean) and between the seed and vegetative parts of the plant (Chesson, 1987; Carre and Brillouet, 1986). Monocotyledons are characterized by the presence of an arabinoxylan complex as the major hemicellulose backbone. The main structure of hemicellulose in dicotyledons is a xyloglucan complex. Moreover, higher pectin concentrations are found in dicotyledons than in monocotyledons. Seeds are generally very high in pectic substances but relatively low in cellulosic material. Three more or less interacting polysaccharide structures can be distinguished in the cell wall: 

 ( 1 )The middle lamella forms the exterior cell wall. It also serves as the point of attachment for the individual cells to one another within the plant tissue matrix. The middle lamella consists primarily of calcium salts of highly esterified pectins;(2)The primary wall is situated just inside the middle lamella. It is a well-organized structure of cellulose icrofibrils embedded in an amorphous matrix of pectin, hemicellulose, phenolic esters and proteins;(3)The secondary wall is formed as the plant matures.During the plant's growth and ageing phase, cellulose microfibrils, hemicellulose and lignin are deposited.The primary cell wall of mature, metabolically active plant cells (e.g. mesophyll and epidermis) is more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than the secondary cell wall, which by this stage, has become highly
