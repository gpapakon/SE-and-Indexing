<ABSTRACT>
In an arrangement for inflating tubeless wheels, the air-proofing 
band (2) housed in the rim comprises a tyre inflating 

valve (1) as an integral part thereto forming up a 
single piece, said valve being inserted into a rim hole (3) 

and positioned by any conventional clamp-tightening means, 
with a nut or by pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an arrangement for inflating 
tubeless wheels. More particularly, this invention refers to an arrangement 
directed to inflating tubeless wheels of bicycles and the 
like and is characterised in that the air inlet valve is an 
integral part of the air-proofing rubber band used. In Spanish utility models Nos.8600785 and 9300686 the use 
of air-proofing rubber bands for bicycle wheels is disclosed, 
said bands making up an elastic belt which is clung to 
on the spoke heads setting up a sealing closure allowing 
thus to leave out the conventional tube. In these wheels, the prior art tyre inflating valve is presently 
used and said valve requires a manual insertion. This valve and the coupling operation, even though effective 
enough as to their performance, have several drawbacks 
regarding mass production and assembly. Basically they are:
 
Valve and rubber band, as two specific pieces are essentially 
required, and subsequently too one must have stocks 
of both readily available with also handling replication. The rubber band hole during assembly must be well mated 
with the one at the rim and the valve be then inserted. The valve shall carefully be clamp-tightened against the 
rim with a nut for obtaining a perfect sealing between the 
valve head and the rubber, this being set up as a critical 
air-proofing area.  Even as a small percentage, any mistake in the above-mentioned 
clamp-tightening meant that at any repairs all the 
tyre, rubber and valve unit shall be detachably removed because 
the clamp-tightening cannot previously be detected 
and only until the tyre is actually inflated, and re-assembly 
thereby means an additional production cost. To avoid all these drawbacks, this arrangement for inflating 
tubeless wheels, being the object of the present invention, 
has been devised and in this arrangement the valve is 
an integral part of the rubber band making up a single piece, 
the main advantages disclosed hereinafter are thus obtained 
with the present arrangement. To have a single piece for inflating and sealing, with 
stocks effective cost-cutting and handling reduction, consequently 
a cost-effective turnout. Easiness in the band assembly because the valve shall be 
inserted in the above-mentioned hole, the present prior art 
assembly costs are thus remarkably cut down. To be able to make a usual clamp-tightening with a nut or 
by pressure since not any air-proofing relies on the former 
as there is not any critical area, and costs are thereby 
again cut down.
