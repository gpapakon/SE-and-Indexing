<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biaxially
oriented film of polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate.
More specifically, it
relates to a biaxially oriented film of polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
useful as a base film for
magnetic recording media, particularly a metal tape,
which are capable of recording for a long time and
high-density recording.A polyethylene terephthalate film has been
and is widely used as a base film for a magnetic tape.
In recent years, a magnetic tape is increasingly
required to perform high-density recording for
downsizing and high-quality display images, and it is
also required to decrease the thickness and increase
the recordable hours of the magnetic tape as a 8-mm
video tape is typically required. Therefore, the
magnetic tape is required to have a magnetic layer
surface having higher flatness, and further, is
required to have a smaller thickness. For complying
with these requirements, the base film is also required
to have a highly flat surface and a smaller thickness.Conventional polyester films used for a
magnetic tape for a home-use VTR have a rough surface,
and no polyester films have satisfied the above
requirements, or can be practically used. It is
therefore required to greatly decrease the surface
roughness for high-density recording. Generally,
however, when the surface roughness of a film is
decreased, the film surface/film surface lubricity
decreases, and air present between the film/film
interface is hardly released, so that it is very
difficult to take up the film in the form of a roll.
This difficulty in taking up the film greatly increases
as the film thickness decreases. For complying with the requirement of an
increase in the recordable hours of a magnetic tape, it
is necessary to decrease the thickness of the base
film. The decrease in the thickness may sometimes
cause a decrease in the stiffness of the tape, so that
the tape edge is liable to be damaged when the tape is
loaded or unloaded, or that a tape undergoes
deformation and recorded data is liable to have a
strain when high tensile force is instantaneously
exerted on the tape. For these reasons, the base film
for a magnetic tape having long recordable hours is
required to have a high Young's modulus.A biaxially oriented polyethylene
terephthalate film has been conventionally used as a
base film for the above magnetic recording tape, and in
particular, there is known a so-called supertensilized
film of which the Young's modulus in the longitudinal
direction is increased for long
