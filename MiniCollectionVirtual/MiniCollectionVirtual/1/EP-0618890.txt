<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a process of oxidizing silyl enol ethers to alpha, beta-unsaturated 
enones by means of radical intermediates. More specifically it relates to preparing enones that are 
intermediates for spectinomycin and its analogs. Spectinomycin and its analogs are known 
antibiotics and are described in U.S. Patent 4.532.336. Hydroperoxides are known to decompose with metal catalyst to give radicals which can be 
used for abstraction of allyl hydrogen atom. A.L.J. Beckwith et al. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1985, 108. 
8230-8234 and M. S. Kharasch et al. J. Org. Chem. 1953 18. 322-327. Oxidation of silyl enol 
ethers with metals and hydroperoxides has been reported to give diacids and ketoacids, K. Kaneda 
et al. Tet. Let. 1981. 2595-2598. The preparation of ketone by oxidation of the corresponding trimethylsilyl enol ether 
is reported in J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol. 107. no. 1, 1985 (pages 268-270). 
In this process, the trimethylsilyl enol ether is reacted with benzeneselenyl chloride 
followed by direct oxidation with metachloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA). The present invention provides: A process from preparing an alpha, beta-unsaturated enone of Formula I 
 
which comprises oxidizing a silyl enol ether of formula II 
 
with a radical intermediate generated by the metal catalyst decomposition of a peroxide in the 
presence of a solvent wherein R is selected from the group consisting of (C1 - C8) alkyl, phenyl, 
and substituted phenyl, or the two R groups together can form the residue of a ring system; with 
the proviso that the peroxide used cannot be hydrogen peroxide. A preferred embodiment of this invention is a process for preparing an alpha. beta-unsaturated  
 
enone of a spectinomycin analog of Formula III 
 
which comprises oxidizing a silyl enol ether of Formula IV 
 
with a radical intermediate generated by the metal catalyst decomposition of a peroxide in the 
presence of a solvent wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of 
halogenated carbonyl and alkoxylcarbonyl and R2 is selected from the group consisting of triethylsilyl, 
trimethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl, and diphenylmethylsilyl. In this process free radical intermediates are utilized to oxidize silyl enol ethers to alpha. 
beta-unsaturated enones. The radical intermediates are generated by the metal catalyst 
decomposition of peroxides. The term (C1 - C8) alkyl means methyl, ethyl, propyl butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl and 
isomeric forms thereof: The terms halogenated carbonyl, and alkoxycarbonyl are terms described 
in
