<ABSTRACT>
An integrated structure is described, that 
comprises a vertical bipolar transistor and a vertical 

MOSFET transistor, where, in order to reduce the series 
resistance of the MOSFET transistor, the collector 

region of the bipolar transistor and the drain region 
of the MOSFET transistor are both parts of a common 

zone and are contiguous each other, so that the high 
charge injection in the collector region when the 

bipolar transistor is in conduction state, causes a 
simultaneous increase in the conductivity of the drain 

region of the MOSFET transistor. 
Both transistors are formed by cells each 
containing an elementary bipolar transistor and an 

elementary MOSFET transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated
monolithic semiconductor structures and, more
specifically, to a structure comprising a vertical
bipolar transistor and a vertical MOSFET transistor
as defined in the preamble of claim 1 and known
from EP-A-176753.It is well-known a structure wherein a field
effect transistor is connected to a bipolar transistor
to form a three-terminal device of Darlington type,
that is, a device wherein the terminals, of collector
and drain respectively of the two transistors are
coupled into one common terminal, that constitutes one
of the terminals of the device, and the source terminal
of the field effect transistor is connected to the base
terminal of the bipolar transistor. The other two
terminals of the device consist of the gate terminal of
the field effect transistor and the emitter terminal of
the bipolar transistor. Such device is characterized by
a high input impedance and a low driving current, by
virtue of the field effect transistor acting as a
driving stage, but exhibits a series resistance in
conduction between the power terminals, that is the
emitter and collector terminals, which is relatively
high because of the series resistance (RDSon) of the 
field effect transistor. This is a limit in the usage of this
structure for supplying power to high current loads because of
the important power losses due to dissipation on the series
resistance.The above-identified document EP-A-0176753 discloses
integrated MOSFET and bipolar transistors exhibiting a mutual
interaction which causes a reduction of the MOSFET series
resistance.From document EP-A-0103934 it is known to combine a bipolar
emitter region with an insulated-gate field-effect power
transistor to obtain a structure in which the series resistance
of the source-drain path of the transistor is reduced by carrier
injection from the bipolar emitter region into the drain region.Document WO-A-85 04285 discloses integrated vertical MOSFET
and bipolar transistors which share a common zone with the
function of drain and collector region, respectively.The main object of the present invention is to provide an
integrated monolithic structure comprising a bipolar transistor
and a field effect transistor having a low series resistance in
conduction (RDSon).This object is reached according to the invention by a
structure as defined and characterized in claim 1.The invention will be better understood and its adavantages
will result clearly by reading the following description of one
examplary non-limiting embodiment
