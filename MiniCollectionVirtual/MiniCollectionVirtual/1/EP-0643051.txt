<ABSTRACT>
The invention aims at providing a safe technique for remarkably improving the yield of an α,β-unsaturated ketone through 
introduction of an ω-chain into an aldehyde without being accompanied by the generation of hydrogen in the process for synthesizing 

a prostaglandin, in particular, one having at least one halogen atom in the 16- or 17-position. The invention process comprises 
conducting the reaction of an aldehyde with a 2-oxoalkylphosphonate in the presence of a base and a zinc compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing α,β-unsaturated ketones which are useful as
synthetic intermediates for prostaglandins.It is known that there are many
prostaglandins having the prostanoic acid skeleton
represented by the formula:

that exhibit characteristic pharmacological activities.The Corey method has been known for a long time and is
still a typical synthetic procedure for producing
prostaglandins.The Corey method includes the step of producing
an α,β-unsaturated ketolactone (III) from Corey lactone
(I) via Corey aldehyde (II): 

[wherein Ar represents an aromatic group.]The Corey lactone (I) is oxidized to the Corey aldehyde
(II) using the complex of pyridine and chromium trioxide
(so-called Collins oxidation), followed by a reaction
between this aldehyde and an anion generated by reacting
a dimethyl (2-oxoalkyl)phosphonate with sodium hydride to
give the α,β-unsaturated ketolactont (III).Attempts have been made to
carry out the reaction in the presence of sodium hydride and a
copper compound, or a thallium compound, to improve the
yield. However, sodium hydride is likely to produce
hydrogen gas, while use of the copper compound does not
result in an adequate improvement in the yield. The 
thallium compound will act to improve the yield to some extent, but this compound is
toxic and is very expensive. Thus, it has been desired that further improvement be
made in the reaction step.EP-A-0 501 625 discloses a method of producing α,β-unsaturated ketolactones
having one or more halogen substituents at the 16 or 17 position which comprises
reacting a bicyclolactone aldehyde with a dimethyl (2-oxoalkyl) phosphonate which is
substituted by at least one halogen atom at the 3-position of the alkyl group in the
presence of an alkali metal hydride and a zinc compound.The object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing an
α,β-unsaturated ketone in a considerably improved yield in which a ω chain is
introduced into the aldehyde during the process of synthesizing prostaglandins, more
particularly those having at least one halogen atom at the 16 or 17 position.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a method
of producing an α,β-unsaturated ketone which comprises reacting an aldehyde
expressed by the formula:

[where, A1 and A2 represent a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl protection group; B
represents a simple bond or -CH2-; R1 represents a bivalent saturated or unsaturated
aliphatic hydrocarbon residue having a carbon number of 1 to 10; Q
