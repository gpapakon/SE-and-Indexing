<ABSTRACT>
A handrail entry safety device (18) comprising a 
collar (38) and a base (40) is provided for a balustrade 

having an enclosure (12) and a handrail (18). The base 
(40) comprises an upper section (42) and a lower section 

(44), the latter having a seat for receiving the collar 
(38). The upper section (42) is attached to the 

enclosure (12) and is hingedly attached to the lower 
section (44) above where the handrail (18) enters the 

safety device, thereby enabling the lower section (44) 
and the collar (38) to pivot together to operate a 

safety switch (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to balustrades for people
moving devices in general, and to balustrade handrail
entry safety devices for people-moving devices in
particular.Escalators, moving walkways, and other people
moving devices efficiently move a large volume of
pedestrian traffic from one point to another. Passengers
step on moving steps (or belts, treads, or pallets) and
are transported along at a constant rate of speed. For
safety reasons, a passenger handrail is provided on each
side of the steps, travelling in the same direction and
speed as the steps.A balustrade, extending from the entry to the exit
of the people moving device, supports and guides each
handrail. Each balustrade includes a plurality of
balustrade panels (typically glass) which rise up from
an enclosure to support the handrail. Externally, the
enclosure consists of a number of enclosure panels
including an outer decking, an outer cladding, an inner
profile, and a skirt panel. The outer decking and outer
cladding enclose the mechanics on the side of the
balustrade panel opposite the moving steps. The inner
profile and skirt panel enclose the mechanics adjacent
the moving steps.The handrails are connected into endless loops
which travel from one end of the device to the other
along the top of the balustrade panels and then return
through the enclosure. At each end of the balustrades,
the balustrade panels have curved sections, or "newels",
which enable the handrails to curve down and into the
enclosure. The end of the balustrade where the handrail
enters the enclosure and the end where it exits, depends
on which direction the steps are travelling. A person of skill in the art will recognize that
the handrail entering the balustrade enclosure presents
a potentially dangerous pinchpoint. Unwary hands,
particularly small ones, can easily be drawn into the
enclosure along with the moving handrail and thereby be
injured.Numerous attempts have been made in the prior art
to prevent hands or other foreign objects from entering
the enclosure, or to minimize the damage to those
objects drawn in, or both, for example JP 5078083, on
which the preamble to claim 1 is based. Some of the
problems with the prior art solutions include marginal
effectiveness and reliability. Hence, a person of skill
in the art will recognize that a more effective and more
reliable safety device is desirable.In accordance with the invention there is provided
a handrail entry safety device for a balustrade having
an enclosure and a handrail, characterised in that the

<CLAIMS>
A handrail entry safety device (18) for a
balustrade having an enclosure (12) and a handrail (16),

characterised in that the device (18) comprises:

a collar (38); and
a base (40), said base (40) having a first section
(42) and a second section (44) having a seat (58) for

receiving said collar (38);
wherein said second section (44) and said collar
(38) receive and substantially surround the handrail

(16) when said device is assembled to said balustrade;
and
wherein said first section (42) is hingedly
attached to said second section (44) at a position such

as to enable said second section (44) and said collar
(38) to pivot together in the event that in use an

object strikes said second section (44) and/or said
collar (38).
A handrail entry safety device (18) according to
claim 1


wherein said first section is an upper section (42)
of the base (40), and said second section is a lower

section (42) of the base (40), said upper section being
hingedly attached to said lower section (44) above the

handrail (16), thereby enabling said lower section (44)
and said collar (38) to pivot together.
A handrail entry safety device according to claim 1
or 2, wherein said collar (38) comprises:


a first surface (66);
a seat surface (70); and
a channel (72), having a cross-sectional area,
extending through said surfaces, wherein said cross-sectional

area of said channel (72) increases as said
channel extends from said first surface (66) to said

seat surface (70); and 
wherein said collar (38) seats in, and is attached
to, said second or lower section (44) along said seat

surface (70).
A handrail entry safety device according to claim
3, wherein said seat surface (70) of said collar (38)

and said seat of said second or lower section (44)
comprise mating surfaces.
A handrail entry safety device according to claim
4, wherein said base (40) has a front (46) and a rear

surface (48), and said seat is formed in said front
surface (46); and


wherein said mating surface of said seat forms an
acute angle with said rear surface (48) of said base

(40), said acute angle defined by an initial line in the
plane of said rear surface and a terminal line in the

plane of the seat, said angle being swept through said
base;
wherein lateral forces applied within said channel
tend to push said collar material up said seat, away

from said channel.
A handrail entry safety device according to any of
claims 3, 4 or 5 wherein said collar (38) further

comprises an exterior surface (68), extending from said
first surface (66) to said seat surface (70), at an

angle away from the handrail received within said
channel (72);


wherein said angled exterior surface (68) tends to
deflect foreign objects away from the handrail.
A handrail entry safety device according to any of
claims 3 to 6, wherein said first surface (66) is

perpendicular to the direction of travel of the handrail
(18).
A handrail entry safety device according to any 
preceding claim, wherein said collar (38) comprises

cellular sponge rubber having a hardness on the Shore
scale of between 30A and 35A.
A handrail entry safety device according to any
preceding claim, wherein said base (40) comprises

thermoplastic polyurethane having a hardness on the
Shore scale of between 90A and 95A.
A handrail entry safety device according to any
preceding claim wherein said first or upper section (42)

further comprises means (50) for attaching said base
(40) to the enclosure (12) of the balustrade (14).
A handrail entry safety device according to any
preceding claim, further comprising a switch means (30)

the arrangement of said switch means being such that in
use an object striking and pivoting one or both of said

second or lower section (44) and said collar (38) toward
the enclosure (12), actuates said switch means (30).
