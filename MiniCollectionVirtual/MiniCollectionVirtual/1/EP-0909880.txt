<ABSTRACT>
An actuation system (36) for variable position stator vanes (28) in a
turbine. The vanes are pivotally mounted in a casing (20) and the actuation

system includes a plurality of levers (38) joined to the respective vanes. An
actuation ring (40) coaxially surrounds the casing adjacent to the levers.

A plurality of circumferentially spaced apart ring guides (48) are joined to the
casing for guiding circumferential rotation of the ring. Respective slip joints

(50) are provided between each of the levers (38) and the actuation ring (40)
for varying pivot length of the levers as the ring is rotated for effecting

nonlinear vane actuation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and,
more specifically, to variable stator vane actuation in multi-stage axial
compressors thereof.In a gas turbine engine, air is pressurized in a compressor and channeled
to a combustor wherein it is mixed with fuel and ignited for generating hot
combustion gases which flow downstream therefrom into one or more turbine
stages which extract energy therefrom for powering the compressor and
producing useful work. A typical compressor has a plurality of axial stages
which compress the air in turn as it flows downstream. And, each
compressor stage includes a row of rotor blades extending radially outwardly
from a compressor spool or disk, and a cooperating row of stator vanes
extending radially inwardly from an annular casing.In order to control performance and stall margin of the compressor,
many of the stator vane rows are variable for selectively adjusting the angle
of the vanes relative to the air being compressed. Variable stator vanes
include a spindle which extends radially outwardly through a casing and to
which is attached a lever. The lever in turn is pivotally joined to a unison ring
coaxially surrounding the compressor casing. The several unison rings for the
different variable stages are in turn typically joined to a common beam
pivotally joined to the casing at one end and joined to a suitable actuator at
an opposite end. The actuator pivots the beam which in turn rotates the
unison rings connected thereto which in turn rotates the respective levers 
attached thereto for pivoting the corresponding stator vanes.Since the individual levers are pivotally joined to the unison rings, the
unison rings are allowed to rotate circumferentially and translate axially to
follow the path of the levers. The rotation of the unison rings directly rotates
the attached levers and vanes in a substantially linear cooperation. And, the
amount of stator vane pivoting varies from stage to stage since the several
unison rings are joined to the common beam at correspondingly different
pivoting lengths from the pivoting end of the beam.Since a gas turbine engine typically operates over a range of output
power, the operation of the compressor is correspondingly scheduled for
maximizing efficiency of operation without undergoing undesirable
aerodynamic stall. Vane scheduling is controlled by the kinematic motion of
the levers, unison rings, and actuation beam.However, it is desirable to introduce further variability in the stator vane
position schedule for
