<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymers and their use as additives in crude oil,
lubricating oil and fuel oil.It is known that wax separates from crude oil, lubricating oil and fuel oil as their
temperature is lowered, thus reducing their ability to flow. It is also known to use
additives (called "Cold Flow Improvers") to improve the ability of the oil to flow,
and a number of such additives are described in the art. A Cold Flow Improver
acts as a wax crystal modifier when blended with waxy mineral oil by modifying
the size and shape of the wax crystals therein and reducing the adhesive forces
between the crystals and between the crystals and the oil to permit the oil to
remain fluid at a lower temperature.Examples of known additives are polymeric materials based on or derived from
alpha-olefins, for example as described in US Patents Nos 2,895,915;
3,252,771; 3,252,772; 3,767,561; 3,790,358; 4,022,590; 4,132,663; 4,255,159
and 3,920,622.EP-A-0,317,240 describes an α-olefinic random copolymer with specific physical
properties comprising 70%-99.9% by weight of an alpha-olefin component
having 5 to 10 carbon atoms and 0.1%-30% of an α,ω-nonconjugated diene
component having 6-20 carbon atoms. Such a copolymer exhibits improved
mouldability and high vibration damping performance at high temperature.US Patent No. B 632,416 describes interpolymers composed of ethylene and a
small weight percent of higher olefinic hydrocarbons having 5 to 18 atoms per
molecule. Such polymers are described as useful for mouldings, pipes and wire
coatings.UK Patent No. 1,303,074 describes pour point depressants for middle distillate
fuel oils being copolymers essentially only of ethylene and at least one higher
olefin, containing 1.1 to 30 molar proportions of ethylene per molar proportion of
straight chain C12 to C22 alpha-olefin, and having a number average molecular
weight of 1,000 to 50,000. Further WO-A-9111488 describes inter alia the use, as a wax crystal modifier in
a fuel oil, of a copolymer derived from ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin of
the formula CH2=CHR1 wherein R1 represents an alkyl group having from 1 to
18 carbon atoms, at least 30% of the chains of which polymer have terminal
ethenylidene unsaturation, the polymer having a number average molecular
weight in the range of from 300 to 15000 and a molar ethylene content in the
range of from 40 to 90%, the polymer being obtainable by polymerisation in the
presence of a metallocene catalyst.However, both UK 1,303,074 and WO-A-91/11488 indicate that ethylene alpha
