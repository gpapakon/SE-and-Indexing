<ABSTRACT>
A garment size indicating system 
is 

provided in the form of a garment hanger (110) equipped with a 
tab-holding 

section that accommodates a size-indicating tab (128). The 
size-indicating tab (128) is provided in the form of a stick or 

coil (196) of tabs (128) for easy 
installation. Once the size-indicating tab (128) is inserted into the 

tab-holding section, it is substantially unremovable without the 
use of a pronged or otherwise sharp tab-removing tool. Any 

removal of the tab (128) from the tab-holding section will 
substantially damage the tab (128) and render it useless. The tab (128) 

is ergonomically designed to reduce 
the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome in assembly-line workers 

charged with the task of installing the tabs (128) on the garment 
hangers (110).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an improved system for
indicating the size of a garment suspended from a garment hanger.
Specifically, this invention relates to an improved system for
easily indicating the sizes of the garments on hangers in retail
outlets. Structurally, the garment hanger is equipped with a
size-indicating tab that cannot be easily removed from the hanger
after it is attached thereto without destroying the tab. The tab
and tab-holder mounted on the hanger are of an improved ergonomic
design that reduces the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome in
assembly-line workers who attach the tabs to the hangers. The
tab is provided in stick form to decrease the assembly time and
improve the manufacturing process for size-indicating garment
hangers.The concept of a garment hanger that includes a label
indicating the size of the garment hung thereon is well-known.
However, modern safety standards require a size-indicating tab to
be irremovable once installed on a hanger. From the standpoint
of safety, if a small tab can be easily removed from a hanger, it
may become lodged in a child's throat. But another problem has
arisen in wake of the development of permanently attached size-indicating
tabs. Specifically, the tabs are difficult to attach
to the hangers and assembly-line workers may develop carpal 
tunnel syndrome as a result of installing the tabs on the
hangers.Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common nerve disorder affecting
the hands, wrist and forearm of its victims. Specifically,
carpal tunnel syndrome results from the compression of the median
nerve at the wrist, within the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel
acts as a conduit for important nerves, blood vessels and tendons
extending through the wrist to the thumb and fingers. The
compression of nerves in the carpal tunnel causes sensory and
motor changes in the median distribution of the hand. Carpal
tunnel syndrome usually occurs in women between ages 30 and 60
and poses a serious occupational health problem. Assembly-line
workers, packers and persons who repeatedly use poorly designed
tools are most likely to develop this disorder. Any strenuous
use of the hands, including sustained grasping, twisting or
turning, may aggravate this condition.Thus, a need exists for an improved size-indicating tab that
is easier for the assembly-line worker to install on a garment
hanger and easier to manufacture. The size-indicating tab must
also include the non-removable aspects previously known so as to
not create a child-safety problem. With the above

<CLAIMS>
A garment hanger assembly having garment support
means (12), hang means (11), and a sizing system for indicating

the size of a garment carried by the garment hanger (10),
wherein the size-indicating system includes a base member (16)

extending away from the garment hanger (10), a seat member (17)
at the distal end of the base member (16) with that portion of

the seat member (17) which is adjacent the base member (16)
having a greater thickness than the thickness of the distal end

of the seat member, and a size-indicating tab (24) having a
generally U-shaped configuration which includes a bight portion

(27) and a pair of side walls (25, 26) which extend in
generally the same direction from the bight portion of the tab

towards the hanger (10), the bight portion (27), when the tab
(24) is assembled to the seat member (17), being disposed at

the distal end of the seat member, the innermost end of each
side wall (25, 26) having an end portion which projects

inwardly towards the base member (16) when the tab (24) is
assembled to the seat member (17), the open distance between

the inwardly-projecting end portions of the side walls (25, 26)
which project towards the base member (16) being less than the

thickness of the seat member (17) adjacent the base member (16)
so as to resist separation of the tab (24) from the seat member

(17),
there being blocking means (21, 22) which project outwardly from

the base member (16) on each side thereof at a location beneath
the inwardly-projecting end portion of the innermost end of each

side wall (25, 26), the blocking means being located so close to
the innermost ends of the side walls as to preclude obtaining a

finger purchase on the innermost ends of the tab side walls,

characterised
 in that no portion of the side walls (25,
26) between the innermost ends and the bight portion (27) is

in separation-restraining engagement with the seat member (17),
and that

the inwardly projecting end portions are disposed adjacent to
and immediately rearward of the seat member (17) when the tab

(24) is assembled thereto.
A garment hanger assembly according to claim 1,

characterised
 in that at least one channel (142, 143, 144) is 
formed in blocking means (21, 22) on each side of the base

member (16), the channel, or each channel, being sufficiently
narrow to preclude finger purchase on the innermost end of the

tab (24) while being sufficiently wide and deep to receive a
tool by which the innermost end portions of the side walls (25,

26) of the tab (24) may be pried apart a distance sufficient
to enable the tab to be removed from the garment hanger.
A garment hanger assembly according to claim 2,

characterised
 by channel means in the seat member (17) which
extend at least part way towards the outermost end of the seat

member, the channel means being aligned with a channel in the
blocking means (21, 22) to enable a tool to slide smoothly

through the blocking means and the seat member in the process
of removal of the tab (24) from the seat member.
A garment hanger assembly according to claim,

characterised
 in that the tab (24) is an end-tab in a plurality
of size-indicating tabs (196) which are aligned end-to-end in

series, the tabs being integrally connected one to the other
by a thin cross section which is sufficiently small to provide

no significant resistance to snapping-off one tab from the
balance of tabs by finger-applied pressure during the assembly

of a leading tab in a series of tabs to the garment hanger
(10).
A garment hanger assembly according to claim 4,

characterised
 in that the aligned tabs (128) are connected at
the outermost portion of their bight portions.
A garment hanger assembly according to claim 5,

characterised
 in that the tabs (128) are initially formed as
an extrusion, following which the individual tabs are formed

by severing the ends of the side walls (25, 26) and, also,
some, but not all, of the bight portions.
