<ABSTRACT>
The castor includes a clevis with two wings (1A, 1B) supporting a rotation spindle (6) about which there are mounted two flanges 8A, 8B which are free to rotate and distant from one another so that they can engage in the grooves in the surface of the walkway (pavement) and a braking means (20) which is set back between the two flanges and allows them to rotate, the braking means (20) being designed to come into contact with the ribs of the surface when the two flanges (8A, 8B) are engaged in the grooves of this surface. According to the invention, the braking means consists of an intermediate member (20) mounted so that it can rotate freely about the spindle 6 and including an end-fitting (24) which is designed to butt up against a stationary element of the cart (1).

<CLAIMS>
A trolley wheel capable of being immobilised on an 
inclined pavement with a grooved surface, comprising a fork 

with two wings (1A, 1B) supporting a rotation shaft (6) about 
which are mounted two wheel disks (8A, 8B) which are free to 

rotate and spaced from each other in such a way as to be able 
to engage in the grooves in said surface and a braking means 

(20) set back between the two wheel disks (8A, 8B) and 
permitting their rotation, said braking means (20) being 

capable of coming into contact with the ribs of said surface 
when the two wheel disks (8A, 8B) are engaged in the grooves 

therein and consisting of an intermediate member (20) mounted 
so as to rotate freely about said shaft (6) and comprising an 

extension piece (24) capable of coming into a position of 
abutment against a fixed element of the trolley, 

characterized in that, since the fork defines a trough (1) 
open at the bottom, said extension piece (24) is housed in 

said trough (1) and is capable of coming into abutment 
thereagainst to block rotation of the intermediate member 

(20). 
A wheel according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the intermediate member (20) consists of a disk (21) with a 

radial projection forming said extension piece (24). 
A wheel according to either one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said intermediate member (20) comprises 

a receptacle (27) for a removable pad (30) with a sole piece 
(31) of non-skid material. 
A wheel according to either one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the intermediate member comprises a 

strip of non-skid material in the area of contact with the 
ribs on the pavement.  

 
A wheel according to claim 4, characterized in that 
said strip is of polyurethane and is moulded on. 
A wheel according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each wheel disk has a profile suited to 

interacting by interlocking with a complementary profile 
(35) of said intermediate member (20).
