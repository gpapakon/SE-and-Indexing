<ABSTRACT>
Water-dispersible and/or water-emulsifiable co-oligomers contain (a) fatty crotonates; (b) radically copolymerisable, hydrophilic, ethylenically unsaturated acids and/or their anhydrides, and possibly (c) minor amounts of other copolymerisable comonomers. These co-oligomers are used as amphiphilic agents for greasing leather and pelts. Also disclosed are aqueous dispersions of said amphiphilic co-oligomers designed as water-dilutable aqueous-pasty masses. These dispersions may contain other emulsifiers, greasing or water-proofing agents known per se for leathers and pelts, mixed with the co-oligomers.
