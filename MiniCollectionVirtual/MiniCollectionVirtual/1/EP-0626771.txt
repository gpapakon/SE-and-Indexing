<ABSTRACT>
In a passive optical COUPLE ATM network, sampling times are obtained which cannot be accurately defined in time due to delay differences. It is therefore the object to find the exact phase angle of each data packet. For this purpose, the header of the packets is in each case sampled continuously and staggered in time, the staggering corresponding to the time "bit duration/N different samplers" (N = number of). The samples are read in parallel with one another into N shift registers (33.0 - 33.7). The content of the shift registers which is being built up during this process is checked at the bit rate of the packets for whether it corresponds to a predetermined keyword (S) or not. The resultant check bits (P) are stored for the duration of one clock interval. The in each case current check bits and the stored check bits are jointly used for determining the centre of the agreements found. The serial output (43.0 - 43.7) of the shift register (33.0 - 33.7) which corresponds to the respective centre then supplies the samples of the respective packet.
