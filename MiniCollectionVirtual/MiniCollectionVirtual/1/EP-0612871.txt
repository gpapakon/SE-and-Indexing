<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a transporting device, for example for transporting spinning cans (5), with at least one transport track, on which the articles to be transported can be displaced in a row and which has a push rod (2) extending in the longitudinal direction and is movable to and fro by means of a drive (4). In order to provide a transporting device of simple and reliable design which consists of only a few components, it is proposed that the transport track consist of a bearing block (1) with at least two parallel grooves (9) in the form of a part circle, arranged at a distance from one another and extending in the longitudinal direction, that cylindrical push rods (2) provided with flattenings (2a) be arranged in the grooves (9), and that the push rods (2) be rotatable in the grooves (9).

Transport apparatus, especially for the transport 
of spinning cans, with at least one transport track, on 

which the articles (5) to be transported are displaceable 
in a row, and which has push rods (2) which extend in the 

longitudinal direction of the transport track and which, 
by means of a drive (14), are movable to and fro and are 

rotatable in grooves (9), characterized in that the 
transport track consists of bearing blocks (1) having at 

least two part-circular grooves (9) arranged therein 
parallel to and at a distance from one another and 

extending in the longitudinal direction of the transport 
track, and in that cylindrical push rods (2) provided 

over the entire length with flattenings (2a) are arranged 
in the grooves (9). 
Transport apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the transport track consists of two 

bearing blocks (1), each with a part-circular groove (9) 
extending in the longitudinal direction and with a flattened 

push rod (2) arranged therein. 
Transport apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that, in order to transport the articles 

(5), the push rods (2) are rotatable until the push rods 
(2) bear with their round outer surfaces (2b) on the 

underside (5a) of the articles (5). 
Transport apparatus according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that, for tr
ansport, the 
push rods (2) are rotatable through at least 45°. 
Transport apparatus according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the two parallel  

 
push rods (2) of a transport track are rotatable in opposite 

directions to one another. 
Transport apparatus according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that, for the transverse 

transport of the articles to be transported, the two 
parallel push rods (2) of a transport track are rotatable 

in the same direction through 360° or a multiple thereof. 
Transport apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the bearing block (1) of a transport 

track arranged on the floor (6) has run-on slopes (7) 
arranged on the longitudinal sides (1a). 
Transport apparatus according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the two push rods 

(2) of a transport track are rotatable via a hydraulic or 
pneumatic cylinder (11). 
Transport apparatus according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the two push rods 

(2) of a transport track are rotatable via an electrical 
crank drive. 
Transport apparatus according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the drive (4) for 

moving the push rods (2) to and fro moves the push rods 
(2) to and fro together with a drive (3) for rotating the 

push rods (2). 
Transport apparatus according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the drive (4) for 

moving the push rods (2) to and fro is designed as a 
hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder (14). 
Transport apparatus according to at least one of 
Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the drive (4) for 

moving the push rods (2) to and fro is designed as an 
electrical crank drive.
