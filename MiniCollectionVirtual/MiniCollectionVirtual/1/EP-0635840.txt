<ABSTRACT>
An opto-electronic memory system comprises a memory element 
(14) in which information is stored in an array of optically 

readable memory locations (17) and reading means comprising an 
electro-optic, e.g. liquid crystal, shutter arrangement (10) 

which is operable to scan the memory element with reading light 
and an array of linear light sensitive elements (18) disposed 

adjacent the output side of the shutter arrangement and extending 
in the scan direction, the light sensitive element array defining 

a reading surface remote from the shutter arrangement (10) on 
which the memory element (14) is disposed with the memory 

locations (17) in close proximity to the light sensitive elements 
(18) and being operable in a contact sensing mode to sense 

reading light reflected from the memory locations of the memory 
element according to the reflectance characteristics of the 

memory locations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an opto-electronic memory system
comprising a planar memory element in which information is stored
in a two dimensional array of optically readable memory locations
and reading means for optically reading information in the memory
element and providing an electrical output in accordance
therewith, the reading means comprising an electro-optic shutter
arrangement which is operable to address memory locations of the
memory element with reading light and to scan the array with
said reading light along a first direction of the array, and a
light sensing arrangement comprising a planar array of linear
light sensitive elements disposed adjacent to the memory element
with the linear light sensitive elements extending parallel to
one another in said first direction for sensing light from the
memory element.Such a system is described in EP-A-0509597. In this system,
the electro-optic shutter arrangement consists of a planar array
of linear liquid crystal light shutters arranged parallel to one
another and extending in a second direction perpendicular to the
first direction, together with a light source which illuminates
the array over its input side. The memory element, in the form,
for example, of a digital data card, carries optically encoded
data and consists of a medium, such as a photographic medium,
having memory locations arranged in rows and columns whose light
transmission characteristics denote stored information. To read
the stored information the memory element is disposed in a gap
between the array of electro-optic shutters and the array of
light sensitive elements, which consists of thin film photodiodes
in strip form carried on a support. The liquid crystal light
shutters are operated individually in sequence so as in effect to
scan in step fashion a band of light determined by the size of a
light shutter and covering the height of a column of memory
locations in the memory element across the array in the row
direction. The system may also be operated in a random access 
mode wherein the light shutters are operated to scan the memory
element in a non-sequential manner. The system can be used for
reading stored digital data in applications similar to CD-ROM
systems, audio CD systems and so-called laser card systems. In
these systems information consisting of digital data stored in an
optically-readable manner on a carrier such as a disc or card is
read out by electromechanically scanning a light beam over the
carrier and detecting the beam reflected or transmitted in
accord
