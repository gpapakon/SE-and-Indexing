<ABSTRACT>
 Non-aqueous liquid landry detergent compositions which contain a condensed phosphate builder e.g. sodium tripolyphosphate, are rendered more easily dispersed during use, particularly when dispensed using a dosing means, by including a small quantity of a water soluble salt of a hydroxycarboxylic, especially citric or tartaric, acid especially an ammonium, substituted ammonium or alkali metal salt. The compositions include a surfactant, desirably a non-ionic surfactant and may include a bleach e.g. sodium perborate or percarbonate. Desirably a polyoxyalkylene glycol, especially ethylene glycol, having a molecular weight of 100 to 1500 D is also included. The solids of the composition are preferably present as finely divided e.g. less thant 10 (my)m average size, particles in the liquid components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detergent compositions and in particular 
to non-aqueous laundry liquid detergent compositions. Detergent compositions are known which comprise a suspension of a 
builder and optionally other solids in an organic liquid which 
comprises a surfactant. Non-aqueous compositions of this 
type, of good stability, are described in European Patent 
Specifications Nos EP 0030096 B and EP 0120659 B. Such compositions 
may contain phosphate builders, for example alkali metal condensed 
phosphates, for example sodium tripolyphosphate. When a non aqueous composition comprising a condensed phosphate 
builder is contacted with water it is possible with certain models of 
washing machine if used with certain washing programmes to form a 
solid deposit comprising the builder which is slow to dissolve. If 
access of water to the deposit is limited the deposit may not dissolve 
during the washing process. In some cases detergents are placed in containers which are 
introduced into the washing zone. If the container has restricted 
access solid deposits may be left in it especially if it was not dry 
when detergent was placed in it. We have now found that if a minor quantity of a water soluble salt 
of a hydroxycarboxylic acid, particularly of tartaric or citric acid, 
is included in the composition this problem with condensed phosphate 
builders can be substantially mitigated. This invention accordingly provides a substantially non-aqueous 
liquid laundry detergent composition which comprises a surfactant, a 
condensed phosphate builder and a water soluble salt of a hydroxycarboxylic 
acid containing 1 to 6 -COOH groups and 1 to 5 -OH groups 
in an amount to give a weight ratio of the condensed phosphate builder 
to the hydroxy carboxylic acid of 60:1 to 5:1. By "substantially non-aqueous" we mean that the amount of water in 
the composition is sufficiently small that the tendency of the 
condensed phosphate builder to hydrolyse and thus to cause the 
viscosity of the detergent formulation to increase or the formulation 
to gel during storage prior to use is overcome. In practice, it is 
free water i.e. water that is not chemically bound as in water of 
crystallisation, in the formulation that is problematical and the  
 
amount of free water will usually be kept to less than 2%, and very 
desirably less than 1%, by weight of the composition. Small 
quantities of free water are typically present in various components 
of the formulation e.g. non-ionic surfactants and polyethylene glycol, 
and it
