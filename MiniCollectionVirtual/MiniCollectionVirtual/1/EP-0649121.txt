<ABSTRACT>
A digital data on-demand turnkey system at a customer premise wherein N 
number of servers provide for 100% of content distribution of remotely stored 

digitized information, which information may be previewed in real-time, and 
product incorporating selected digitized information can be manufactured on-site 

and within a short response time to a customer's request at a point of 
sale location. In a retail environment customers, at a point-of-sale location 

are able to exhaustively search and preview the content database using 
graphics-based touch screens at consumer kiosks. Previews including audio 

and video segments are made available. Prompting screens allow customers to 
make purchasing decisions by stipulating content which is available from any 

number of categories of subject matter including music. Content can be 
identified by album, artist or partial portions of material within the content 

of the totality of the work. The selected media for the manufacture and 
production of the digital data may be from a myriad of different selections 

and can include CD's, cassette tapes, CD ROM technology, reel-to-reel tapes, 
and video disks, as an example. Since the system is adaptable to having an 

unlimited number of servers, strategic and economic networking is accomplished 
to allocate proportionally the preview material as well as the total content 

of a specific work at the respective servers depending, in particular, on the 
popularity of the content and the costs of transmission. A master server will 

be situated geographically so as to be accessible to chain and network 
subservers. Its geographic and networked location is dependent upon 

communication network systems and subsystem costs and availability in order to 
best serve a customer's premise, whether it be a retail store or similar 

point-of-sale or other end-user location. The strategy of allocating the 
content between the servers, preview and for the final manufacturing process 

for a particular work, is done so as to eliminate the need for any in-store 
inventory of, for example, an artist's composition regardless of format. 

Security mechanisms that require centralized database authorizations prior to 
the transmission of content and/or the manufacture of any of the products is 

provided in addition. The systems provides simplified financial and accounting 
services. The total authorization, accounting and management reporting and 

marketing system collects and maintains data useful to the retailer and the 
content data owners or managers, such as label companies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of data storage and
data communication. In particular, the invention relates to a system
for accessing digital information, such as audio and video information,
at remotely stored locations and for communicating in real-time that
information to another location (such as a user's premise or a point-of-sale)
for reproduction of the communicated information in a material
object for end-user use.Retailers of the world are in a constant struggle to meet the
demands of the consuming public with regard to the availability and
competitive pricing of products. This struggle is a challenge for the
retailer's ability to meet the end-user's immediate need and if an item
must be backordered, the customer's patience. The retailer must do that
in a manner which is cost effective to the merchandiser and competitive
from a delivery and price standpoint to the purchaser.There is likely no more of a demanding and aggressive purchasing
public than those individuals who are avid followers and fans of
entertainers and artists in the entertainment industry. Because of the
high demand and the massive number of customers and potential customers,
as it relates to the entertainment industry, the level of competition is
extremely high, whether it be for memorabilia, contemporary news items,
fashion trends, or entertainment products.Product distribution and availability is one of those
merchandising areas where the retailer has experienced keen competition
and where they have struggled to be the source of all products, to be
identified as having immediate availability, to continue to serve the
totality of the market share which they have captured and to grow that
market share. As an example, in the entertainment industry, particularly as it
applies to companies involved in music typically known as music label
companies, there has been a constant challenge for such companies to
exploit their entire catalog. There is a need or concern to make every
album in their catalog available in any format and to never be out of
stock with respect to that particular product. If the labels are indeed
able to achieve that high level of expectation and availability, the
retailer then is faced with the dilemma of allocating floor space to all
of that available inventory regardless of the popularity of much of the
stocked material. If this is not common practice, the retailer will be
faced with losing a particular customer and clientele if the stock is
not on-hand. In most instances, it is unrealistic to
