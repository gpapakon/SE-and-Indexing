<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for the detection of gastric epithelial damage and a method which is performed by administering a disaccharide to a patient, assaying the patient's blood or urine for the presence of the disaccharide and correlating the determined disaccharide assay value to gastric epithelial damage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention herein is directed to a method for 
the detection of gastric epithelial damage and more 
particularly, is directed to a method for the detection 
of ulcers and lesions in the stomach using non-invasive, 
non-radioactive and non-x-ray techniques or 
procedures. The method herein is useful in detecting 
and diagnosing gastric epithelial damage regardless of 
the cause for such damage. The method herein is 
further advantageous in that the method is site 
specific for damage to the gastric epithelium. Stomach ulcers can pose a serious health threat as 
in many instances ulcers are asymptomatic. Since 
stomach ulcers can develop and be present without any 
symptoms, the damage brought about by the ulcers to the 
stomach and the bleeding associated with such ulcers 
can be a serious health risk. The health risk can 
prove to be fatal. It would be highly desirable to develop a non-invasive 
and accurate method for detecting and 
diagnosing the presence of stomach ulcers. The 
detection and accurate measurement of abnormal mucosa 
in the stomach such as damage to gastric epithelial 
cells would be highly desirable. Such a method could 
be used to diagnose and detect various disorders which 
cause damage to the stomach epithelial cells. 
Illustrative disorders are gastric (stomach) ulcers, 
carcinoma, benign lesions and the like. Stomach ulcers 
can also occur through the use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) which have as a class been 
acknowledged by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
as presenting a serious health risk for causing stomach 
ulcers. The FDA has imposed a warning on labeling for 
NSAIDs advising users of the attendant risk for ulcers 
brought about by the constant use of NSAIDs. Currently there are various methods available for 
detecting stomach ulcers. The currently employed 
method with the most reliability is that of performing  
 
endoscopies of the patient's stomach. In such a 
procedure, an endoscope is passed through the esophagus 
and into the patient's stomach. Such a procedure is 
discomforting but does allow visual inspection of the 
stomach lining. The procedure requires some 
anesthetizing of the patient. Drawbacks of the 
procedure include discomfort, the anesthetizing of the 
patient and that it is dependent on the skill of the 
physician in performing the endoscopy to ensure 
complete review of the stomach for lesions and in 
recognizing lesions. This procedure does not lend 
itself to performance in the physician's office but 
must be

<CLAIMS>
A method for the detection of gastric epithelial damage in 
a patient, the method comprising: 


assaying for the presence of a disaccharide in the blood 
or urine of a patient, which disaccharide is not 

transported across cell membranes and which metabolizes in 
the small intestine to its monosaccharides; 
comparing the disaccharide assay value with a normal 
control value for detecting gastric epithelial damage. 
A method as recited in Claim 1 wherein the disaccharide is 
selected from sucrose, maltose and lactose. 
A method as recited in Claim 2 wherein the disaccharide is 
sucrose. 
Use of a disaccharide which is not transported across 
cell membranes and which metabolizes in the small intestine to 

its monosaccharides for preparing a medicament for the 
detection of gastric epithelial damage in a patient by 

administering the disaccharide to a patient and assaying the patient's 
blood or urine for the presence of the disaccharide and 

correlating the determined disaccharide assay value to 
gastric epithelial damage. 
Use according to Claim 4 wherein the disaccharide is 
selected from sucrose, maltose and lactose. 
Use according to Claim 5 wherein the disaccharide is 
sucrose. 
Use according to Claim 4 wherein the assaying step further 
comprises collecting the patient's urine over time; and 

assaying the collected urine for the presence of the 
disaccharide over such time.  

 
Use according to Claim 7 wherein the urine is collected 
over a period of time of from the first urinary evacuation 

of the patient up to five hours. 
Use according to Claim 4 wherein the assaying step is 
performed on a blood sample collected from the patient. 
Use of a preselected amount of disaccharide which is not 
transported across cell membranes and which metabolizes in 

the small intestine to its monosaccharides for preparing a 
medicament for the detection of gastric epithelial damage 

in a patient by fastning a patient for a preselected time; 
administering a preselected amount of disaccharide to the patient assaying the 

patient's blood or urine for the presence of the 
disaccharide; and correlating the determined disaccharide 

assay value to gastric epithelial damage for detecting 
gastric epithelial damage. 
Use according to Claim 10 wherein the disaccharide is 
selected from sucrose, maltose and lactose. 
Use according to Claim 11 wherein the disaccharide is 
sucrose. 
Use according to Claim 10 wherein the assaying step further 
comprises collecting the patient's urine over time; and 

assaying the collected urine for the presence of the 
disaccharide over such time. 
Use according to Claim 13 wherein the urine is collected 
over a period of time of from the first urinary evacuation 

of the patient up to five hours. 
Use according to Claim 10 wherein the assaying step is 
performed on a blood sample collected from the patient.  

 
Use of a disaccharide which is not transported across 
cell membranes and which metabolizes in the lower intestine to 

its monosaccharides as an indicator of the 
extent of gastric epithelial damage. 
Use of a disaccharide as recited in Claim 16 wherein the 
disaccharide is sucrose, maltose or lactose. 
Use of a disaccharide as recited in Claim 17 wherein 
the disaccharide is sucrose.
