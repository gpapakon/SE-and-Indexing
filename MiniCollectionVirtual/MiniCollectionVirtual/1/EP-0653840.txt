<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement according to the invention exhibits a system for generating a clock signal which generates from a supplied clock signal a number of clock signals which are in each case supplied to a logic and/or driver stage. The output clock signal can be picked up at the output of each stage. This output clock signal is supplied to an amplifier stage having a low operating point, and is subsequently processed by a logic arrangement. The output signal generated by the logic arrangement is used for enabling the basic clock.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for the synchronization of
at least two output clock signals (6) generated from a

single input clock signal (1), having

an enable stage (2), to which the input clock signal
(1) is fed and which enables the input clock signal (1)

under the control of an enable signal,
a branching stage (3), which generates at least two
clock signals from the enabled input clock signal (1),
in each case one logic circuit (4) and/or driver
stage (5) provided for each clock signal, which are

connected downstream of the branching stage (3) and at
whose outputs the at least two output clock signals (6)

can be tapped off,
in each case one amplifier circuit (7) for each
output clock signal (6) for detecting the clock-signal

edges thereof,
a logic arrangement (8), for logically combining the
output signals generated by the amplifier circuits (7)

and for providing the enable signal given the presence
of the same logic state of all the output signals.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that the amplifier circuits (7) are designed as
sense amplifiers having an operating point lying near

the negative supply potential of a supply voltage.
