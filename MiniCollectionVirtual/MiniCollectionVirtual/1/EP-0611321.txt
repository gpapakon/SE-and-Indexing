<ABSTRACT>
A screw for a toy building set has a shank with a threaded section for screwing into another of the elements of the toy building set with a preformed threaded hole. The screw is adapted to resist forces acting transversely to the shank of the screw at a distance from the element. In elongation of the threaded section the screw has an engagement area by which the screw, when screwed in, engages a complementary engagement area on the other toy building set element formed with the threaded hole. The screw is thus supported in an area which is positioned at a greater radial distance from the longitudinal axis of the screw than the radius of the threaded section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a toy building set comprising a 
screw with a shank with threads for screwing into another 
of the elements of the toy building set with a preformed 
threaded hole, so that the screw is capable of resisting a 
force acting transversely to the shank of the screw at a 
distance from the element. It is known from toy building sets of the construction 
type to screw elements together. Thus, there are examples 
that, in addition to ordinary coupling means, such as 
coupling studs and complementary receiving means, elements 
subjected to special loads are also coupled together by 
means of screws constructed for the purpose. These screws 
are screwed into special, preformed threaded holes in 
others of the building elements of the toy building set. 
It is also known to use screws for securing wheels to vehicle 
bottoms built with the elements of the toy building 
set. The mutual intensified attachment of the elements 
takes place in a fully satisfactory manner as far as it 
goes. Such a load is absorbed in the screw in its longitudinal 
direction, and the tension absorbing properties of 
the screw are fully satisfactory. Such a screw is known 
e.g. from the US Patent Specification 4 551 110. The International Patent Application WO-A-9009825 discloses 
a screw which blocks the flexible properties of an 
element. Here too, the tension is applied to the screw in 
the longitudinal direction. However, screws loaded transversely to the longitudinal 
direction of the shank have a significant weakness. The 
diameter of the threaded section of the screw is determined  
 
by the dimensions of the element into which the 
screw is inserted. With respect to the overall structure 
the dimensions of this element are often to be minimized, 
so that the diameter of the threaded section is likewise 
minimized. The moment of force on the screw is determined 
partly by the size of the transverse component of the 
force acting on the screw, partly by the distance between 
the point of application of the force and the contact 
point of the shank with the element (the arm on which the 
force acts) in which the screw is secured. With the requirement 
of a small threaded section diameter screws used 
e.g. as wheel shafts will tend to break in the area positioned 
around the surface of the element when the screw is 
subjected either to great static loads or by pulse impacts 
e.g. when being dropped. A corresponding problem will be 
present if the screw is used for transferring forces in 
the transverse direction

<CLAIMS>
A toy building set comprising a building element (30) 
having a preformed threaded hole (35) therein, and a 

screw (10) having a hollow shank (14) with a threaded 
section (24) at one end for screwing into the threaded 

hole in the building element (30),
 
said screw being made of a thermoplastic material and 

provided as a hollow body including the shank (14), the 
shank (14) having an engagement area (22) for engaging a 

complementary engagement area (35) on the building 
element, when the screw (10) is screwed into the threaded 

hole (35) in the building element (30),
characterized
 in that the engagement area 
(22) on the screw (10) is in the form of a conical 

annular collar spaced from said one end and increasing in 
radius 

with increasing distance 
from the threaded section (24).  

 
A toy building set according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the conical face is 

continuous. 
A toy building set according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the collar forms a transition 

between the threaded section (25) with one diameter and a 
shank section (14) having a diameter greater than said  

 
diameter. 
A toy building set according to claims 1-3, 
characterized
 
in that the engagement areas (22,36) 

are provided with complementary depressions (37) and projections 
(23). 
A toy building set according to claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that the engagement area (22) of the 

screw (10) has at least one depression (23), and that the 
engagement area (36) of the other element (30) has at 

least one knob (37) for reception in the depression (23). 
A toy building set according to claim 5, 
characterized
 
in that the depression (23) is asymmetric 

such that circumferencially it has a steep side face 
serving as a stop face, and an inclined side face serving 

as a guide face upon mutual locking of the elements 
through engagement between knob (37) and depression (23). 
A toy building set according to claims 1-6, 
characterized
 
in that the threaded section (24) of 

the shank (14) is formed by just one convolution around 
the shank of the screw.
