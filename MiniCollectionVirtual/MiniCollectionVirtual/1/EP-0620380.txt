<ABSTRACT>
A viscous torsional vibration damper of the kind operating on the 
shear film principle has a roll spun annular channel shaped housing (10) 

providing an annular working chamber (11) within which is mounted an 
annular complementary inertia mass ring (12) and a viscous damping fluid 

substantially filling shear film spaces between the working surfaces of 
the inertia ring and confronting working surfaces of the housing within 

the chamber. The annular working chamber is formed by first roll 
spinning an inside surface of two adjacent walls (14,17) of the chamber 

and roll spinning an outside surface of a third wall (15). Working 
surface areas of the two walls of the housing within the working chamber 

have a spinning roll burnished finish. A roll formed rabbet provides a 
shoulder seat (31) on one wall of the housing with an edge portion of a 

closure sealed thereto. Laser welding permanently secures the closure to 
the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in viscous 
torsional vibration dampers and is more particularly 
concerned with improving the reliability and lowering 
the cost of such dampers. Viscous torsional vibration dampers of the kind 
to which the present invention is directed have 
heretofore been successfully produced with cast 
ferrous, forged ferrous, stamped, and welded housings 
all machined to provide the desired dimensions, 
providing an axially opening annular working chamber 
within which is housed a complementary annular inertia 
mass ring and with a cover sealed across the axial 
opening of the housing for confining the inertia ring 
within the annular working chamber therein. Opposed 
surfaces of the inertia ring and the housing are in 
shear film spaced relation having regard to a viscous 
damping fluid substantially filling those spaces. 
Cast, forged, and stamped and welded housings require 
much machining, and therefore present a substantial 
cost factor in the dampers. A further proposal has been to finish shape the 
damper housings by hydroforming techniques. This 
necessitates rather wide tolerances and therefore 
unusually high viscosity damping fluid, unless the 
shear film gap surfaces are machined, consequently 
resulting in a costly construction. By way of example 
United States Patent No. 3,512,612 is referred to for 
a disclosure of the hydroforming proposal for such 
dampers.  
 The document US-A 3, 792, 683 discloses a housing 
of a torsional vibration damper. An annular inertia 
weight is rotatably mounted in a closed chamber and 
comprises an iron casting or other weighty material 
covered with a coating such as nylon, Teflon, bronze 
or the like. In order to avoid abrasion of this 
customary coating, the working chamber wall surfaces 
have to be machined in a separate operation. This 
problem is a general one and cannot be avoided with 
prior art dampers. Further, it may occur that because 
of those abrasion processes the damper is not 
dynamically balanced. There are methods known to guarantee a 
dynamically balanced integral clutch housing by use of 
a roller spinning tool. This method, described in US-A 
4, 056, 291, uses a roller to process the outer 
surfaces of the housing, so that rotational symmetry 
of the outer parts of the housing is obtained. 
However, this does not prevent from inhomogeneities 
occurring inside the damper, for instance by the above 
mentioned abrasion of the weight coating. A finishing device for spinning work is disclosed 
in Japanese
