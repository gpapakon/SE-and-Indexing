<ABSTRACT>
Electrostatic toner containing a polymeric binder and, as the charge stabiliser, a 1:2 chromium, iron, cobalt or zirconium complex of azo colorants of the formula: D-N=N-K, where D is derived from a diazo component D-NH2, which arises from the group consisting of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, anthranilic acid and picramic acid, and K is derived from coupling components K-H which arise from the group consisting of (beta)-naphthol, diacetic acid anilide and 1-phenyl-3-methyl pyrazol-5-one, and the use of the aforementioned metal complexes as charge stabilisers in electrostatic toners.

and as charge stabilizer a 1:2 zirconium complex of azo 

dyes of the formula D-N=N-K, where D is derived from a 
diazo component D-NH
2
 selected from the group consisting 
of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol, 2-amino-5-nitrophenol, 2-aminophenol-4-sulfonamide, 

anthranilic acid and picramic acid 
and K is derived from a coupling component K-H selected 

from the group consisting of Î²-naphthol, acetoacetanilide 
and l-phenyl-3-methylpyrazol-5-one. 
An electrostatic toner as claimed in claim 1, 
containing a symmetrical 1:2 zirconium complex of azo 

dyes as charge stabilizer. 
An electrostatic toner as claimed in claim 1, containing 
from 0.01 to 10% by weight, based on the weight 

of the toner, of a 1:2 zirconium complex of azo dyes. 
An electrostatic toner as claimed in claim 1, 
additionally containing a colorant. 
The use of the 1:2 zirconium complexes of azo dyes 
as set forth in claim 1 as charge stabilizers in electrostatic 

toners.
