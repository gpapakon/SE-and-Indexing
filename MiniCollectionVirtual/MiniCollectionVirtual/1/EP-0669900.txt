<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the treatment of incineration residues which are produced, for example, in the incineration of domestic waste, in which method said residues are treated with gas containing CO2. In the treatment, microorganisms may be used which are already present naturally in the incineration residues or can be added thereto. The invention furthermore relates to the use of incineration residues as absorption material for the removal of CO2 from exhaust gases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the treatment of 
incineration residues. It is known that slags which are released in the incineration 
of waste, in particular of domestic waste and waste comparable thereto, 
are usable as foundation material and embankment material in road 
construction and as gravel substitute in concrete (C.R.O.W. (1988): 
Residues are (no longer) waste - WIP slags. Publication 15, Stichting 
C.R.O.W., Ede [1]; Leenders, P. (1984): Management of Solid Waste 
Incinerator Residues in The Netherlands. In: K.J. Thomé-Kozmiensky (ed.): 
Recycling International, Vol. 2, p. 1420-1441. EF-Verlag, Berlin [2]). This material, referred to as WIP slags for short, serves to 
fulfil certain civil-engineering and environmental-hygiene quality 
requirements, depending on the field of application. The environmental-hygiene 
quality requirements can be subdivided into requirements relating 
to the composition and requirements relating to the leachability of the 
product. As far as the territory of the Netherlands is concerned, these 
environmental-hygiene quality requirements will be laid down in the so-called 
Building Materials Order, a General Order in Council (AMVB) within 
the framework of the Soil Protection Act. In said AMVB, a draft of which 
has been published, the stress is placed on the quality requirements 
relating to leaching. Of the civil engineering quality requirements which 
are imposed on applications as foundation material [1], in particular, 
the requirements which are imposed on unincinerated and digestible 
material are relevant within this framework. For applications as gravel 
substitute in concrete, the pH is also important. In order to meet the requirements of the Building Materials 
Order, it is necessary to suppress the leaching of heavy metals from WIP 
slags. Such processes, generally-referred to as immobilization processes, 
are generally known and are subdivided into physico-chemical and thermal 
processes. The object of physico-chemical processes is to produce a hard, 
low-porosity and durable matrix by using binders and other aggregates and 
at the same time fix impurities in the form of sparingly soluble 
compounds. The formation of a hard matrix according to known methods, in 
which, for example, use is made of a binder is in general not a problem. 
According to leaching tests, however, in many cases no chemical binding  
 
of the impurities occurs. After reduction of the matrix, the leaching is 
often again at the level of the starting material. Another weak

Method for the immobilisation of heavy metals and/or 
metalloids in waste incineration residues by treating the residues 

with gas containing 0.1 to 100 % by volume of CO
2
 at a temperature 
from the ambient temperature to 200°C under a pressure from atmospheric 

pressure to 10 bar overpressure, during which treatment the 
pH of the waste incineration residues used as a starting material is 

lowered, the residues being treated as such and 
not via slurrying in water. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the method 
is carried out with gas containing 5-20% by volume of CO
2
 at a 
temperature of not more than 100°C and an overpressure of not more 

than 1 atmosphere. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that microorganisms are added during or before the 

treatment with CO
2
. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 1-3. characterized 
in that nutrients are added at the start of or during the treatment 

with CO
2
 to stimulate the growth of microorganisms. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 1-4, characterized 
in that the required CO
2
 is supplied completely or partly in the 
form of flue gases or other CO
2
-rich off-gas flows. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in that flue gases 
originating from the waste incineration plant are used. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 1-6, characterized 
in that the required CO
2
 is separated from biogas, flue gases or 
other CO
2
-rich gases and then mixed with air to the required 
composition.  

 
Method according to one or more of Claims 1-7, characterized 
in that a gas containing water vapour is used. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 1-8, characterized 
in that the process is carried out batchwise by passing the CO
2
-rich 
gas through the residue to be treated in a sealed chamber. 
Method according to one of more of Claims 1-9, characterized 
in that the process is carried out continuously by bringing the 

residue to be treated into contact with the CO
2
-rich gas in a mixing 
drum, silo or comparable processing apparatus. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 1-10, characterized 
in that the pH of the incineration residues is set to 7-8.5 by the 

treatment with CO
2

2
-rich off-gases, such as flue 
gases, biogas, disposal-site gas or off-gas of composting plants, the 

residues being used as such and not in 
an aqueous slurry.
