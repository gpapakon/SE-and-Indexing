A measuring device for measuring the thermal conductivity and/or the calorific 
capacity in a transitory regime of an injectable or non-injectable material, comprising 

two plane wall heat exchangers (3a, 3b) located on one side and the other of a flat 
plate (1) with parallel walls, sufficiently conductive of heat to be regarded as 

isothermal and bounding with the said plate two substantially identical chambers, 
means for heating and/or cooling (5, 6) the said heat exchangers (3a, 3b), two 

specimens (2a, 2b) of the material to be characterized, of similar thickness (E), located 
in the said chambers respectively between the external face of the exchanger (3a, 3b) 

and on face of the central separating plate (1), in such a manner as to be traversed by 
a heat flux (a, b), a device for positioning and maintaining the exchangers (3a, 3b) 

substantially parallel to the central plate (1) in such a manner as to ensure contact 
under uniform pressure between the walls of the exchangers (3a, 3b), the external 

faces of the specimens (2a, 2b) and the faces of the central plate (1), insulating means 
closing the edges remaining free of the said chambers in order to ensure a 

unidirectional heat flux (a, b), and at least two temperature sensors of which one 
(T2), formed by a thermocouple, is integrated in the central plate (1) and of which the 

other (T1), also formed by a thermocouple, is integrated in the external wall of the 
plate of one of the exchangers (3a). 
A measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a 
third temperature sensor formed by a thermocouple (T3) integrated in the external wall 

of the plate of the second exchanger (3b). 
A measuring device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
respective thicknesses (Ep and E) of the central separating plate (1) and the specimen 

(2a or 2b) to be characterized are selected in a manner such that: 

(Ep/E
2
) 
<
 0.1 αP/αE, 1/ΔΘ 
 
and 


Ep/E ≤ 0.5, 
  
 

αP and αE being the respective diffusivities of the plate (1) and the specimen (2a, 2b), 
ΔΘ being the range of variation of temperature imposed by the said heating and/or 

cooling means (5, 6). 
A measuring device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
insulation has a thermal conductivity lower than 0.1 w/m/K and a thermal capacity 

lower than 2.10
5
 J/kg/K. 
A measuring device according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
recording of temperature curves T1(t), T2(t), T3(t) of the thermocouples is effected 

over a period [t, t+Δt] for a variation in temperature [Θ, Θ+ΔΘ]
 only when thermal 
equilibrium of the device has been attained, i.e. when the change of T1(t) is identical 

to that of T2(t). 
A measuring device according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
thickness E of the specimen (2a, 2b) to be characterized satisfies the following 

relation: 

E
2
 ≤ λTπ
2
/γ Cp 
 
λ, γ, Cp being respectively the conductivity, the specific gravity and the volumetric 

specific heat in the temperature range involved of the specimen of the material to be 
characterized, in such a manner that the time T is the maximum time necessary and 

sufficient before being able to effect the measurement. 
A measuring device according to claim 1, characterized in that the device for 
positioning and maintaining the exchangers is formed by movable plates of a press 

whose confronting faces are fixed to the said exchangers. 
A method of identifying the optimum conductivity of a material by means of a 
measuring device in accordance with claim 1, providing at least the curves (T1(t), 

T2(t)) provided by the succession of object responses, characterized in that a model of 
finite difference type is created allowing a model response Θ(t) to be obtained, in that 

a divergence criterion is defined  
 


 
where 


Θ
k
 is the calculated temperature at the instant k 
and T
k
 is the measured temperature at the instant k 
 
which enables the divergence between the temperatures measured in the central plate 

and the calculated temperatures for the same point and at the same instants for the 
model, the said minimisation taking place iteratively in such a manner as to adjust 

successively the set of parameters according to a method of successive approximation, 
and in that a check is made for each new value of the criterion whether it satisfies the 

stop condition given by the equality J = Σ, Σ being taken to be negligible in such a 
manner as either to stop the calculation, the optimum value of the conductivity having 

been obtained, or to recommence the calculations recited above.
