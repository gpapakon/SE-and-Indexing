<ABSTRACT>
A portable electronic translation device has an input unit (2), a multiple-line display (3) and at least one memory unit. The input unit (2) has a memory key (4), by means of which the user can store words, phrases or sentences and their translations in at least one language. The device can be used because of this as an educational aid for language pupils who store in the device whatever progress they have made as they learn and by inputting the already stored word in one language obtain the corresponding translation, which they can thus memorise.
