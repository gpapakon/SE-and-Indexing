<ABSTRACT>
In a video recorder (2) having an electronically tunable tuner (19) and a 
connector (4) to which a cabling (6) can be connected, which cabling can also be 

connected to a connector (5) of a television receiver (3) which also has a tuner (46), at 
least one comparison device (69, 75, 130) of the video recorder (2) is connected to the 

tuner (19) of the video recorder (2) and to the connector (4) of the video recorder (2) 

via
 each time one connection (65, 66, 73, 77) in order to compare at least one 
component of one of the two received signals supplied by the tuner (46) of the 

television receiver (3) and applied to the connector (4) thereof with the corresponding 
component of the received signal supplied by the tuner (19) of the video recorder (2), 

which comparison device (69, 75, 130) supplies an inequality signal in the case of 
inequality of the signals applied to it, and an equality signal in the case of equality of 

the signals applied to it, the tuner (19) of the video recorder (2) being successively 
tuned to different stations when the inequality signal is produced and the tuner (19) of 

the video recorder (2) being kept tuned to a station when the equality signal is 
produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a video recorder having an electronically tunable
tuner which can be tuned to each time one station of a plurality of stations and after it
has been tuned to a station supplies a received picture signal and a received sound
signal, and having a connector to which a cabling can be connected, which cabling can
also be connected to a connector of a television receiver which also has a tuner which
can be tuned to each time one station of a plurality of stations and after it has been
tuned to a station supplies a received picture signal and a received sound signal, which
received signals can both be applied to the video recorder via the cabling.Such a video recorder is generally known in a multitude of versions. For
example, such a video recorder manufactured by the Applicant has been marketed under
the type number VR 6760. Such a video recorder can form a video system comprising a
television receiver and this video recorder, which television receiver and video recorder
may be constructed as separate units or may be combined to form a single unit. In such
a video system the tuner of the television receiver and the tuner of the video recorder
are frequently tuned to different stations transmitting different programs, i.e. different
program signals. However, the user of the video system often wishes to have the
possibility of properly and rapidly receiving the same program signal by means of the
tuner of the video recorder as by means of the tuner of the television receiver, for
example in order to apply a program signal corresponding to the television program
being watched on the television receiver by the user to the recording electronics of the
video recorder via the tuner of the video recorder, to record this very program signal by
means of the video recorder, regardless of whether during such a recording the
television receiver is set to another television program or is even turned off. For this
purpose, the tuner of the video recorder should be tuned accurately and as rapidly as
possible to a station broadcasting the same program signal as that transmitted by the
station to which the tuner of the television receiver has been tuned. Until now, in order
to obtain such a tuning of the tuner of the video recorder, the user should several times 
start, for example, a search tuning mode of the tuner of the video recorder until the
tuner of the video recorder is tuned to a station broadcasting the same program signal as
that transmitted by the station to which the tuner of the

A video recorder having an electronically tunable tuner which can be
tuned to one station of a plurality of stations and after it has been tuned to a

station supplies a received picture signal and a received sound signal, and having a
connector to which cabling can be connected, which cabling can also be connected to

a connector of a television receiver which also has a tuner which can be tuned to
one station of a plurality of stations and after it has been tuned to a station supplies

a received picture signal and a received sound signal, which received signals can both
be applied to the video recorder 
via
 the cabling, characterized in that at least one
comparison device of the video recorder is connected to the tuner of the video recorder

and to said connector of the video recorder in order to compare at least one component
of one of the two said received signals supplied by the tuner of the television receiver and

applied to the video recorder, with the corresponding component of the received signal
supplied by the tuner of the video recorder, in that such a comparison device is adapted

to supply an inequality signal in the case of inequality of the two received signals
supplied to it and to supply an equality signal in the case of equality of the two received

signals supplied to it, and in that the tuner of the video recorder is successively tuned to
different stations when such a comparison device supplies an inequality signal and the

tuner of the video recorder is kept tuned to a station when such a comparison device
supplies an equality signal.
A video recorder as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the received
picture signal supplied by the tuner of the television receiver and applied to the video

recorder and the received picture signal supplied by the tuner of the video recorder are
applied to said comparison device, and that the comparison device is adapted to

compare the luminance signal components of the two picture signals.
A video recorder as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
received sound signal supplied by the tuner of the television receiver and applied to the

video recorder, to the connector thereof, and the received sound signal supplied by the 
tuner of the video recorder are applied to said comparison device, and the comparison

device is adapted to compare the two sound signals.
A video recorder as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that
there are provided devices for deriving synchronisation signals from the received picture

signal supplied by the tuner of the television receiver and from the received picture
signal supplied by the tuner of the video recorder, and in that the comparison device is

adapted to compare the synchronisation signals derived from the two picture signals.
A video recorder as claimed in Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterized in that
such a comparison device is formed by a correlation device.
