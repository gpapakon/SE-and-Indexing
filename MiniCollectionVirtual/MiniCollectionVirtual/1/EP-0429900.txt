<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing hollow valves, especially those with a coolant introduced into the hollow valve stem. The cavity in the valve stem is preferably drilled from the valve disc side and after the coolant has been introduced if required - is reclosed by means of deposition welding, a thin plug introduced into the hole to a defined depth temporarily holding the weld pool of the deposition weld. The use of deposition welding allows cost savings over other closure methods. The deposition welding is preferably carried out by a method in which the workpiece does not form part of an electric circuit through which welding energy flows, such methods including oxy-gas welding, electron beam welding or laser welding. With these methods, it is possible to avoid so-called edge effects.

Process for the production of hollow gas exchange valves 
(1) for elevating piston machines, the gas exchange valves 

(1) having a valve shaft (2) which is hollow and 
hermetically closed on the exterior and which project from 

the valve head, in which process 

an axial, side, open, bored hole (6) disposed in the valve 
shaft (3), 
in the opening of the bored hole (6, 22, 23, 23') on the 
front face to be closed there is a fillet inserted (7, 7', 

7'') which corresponds in size at least to the diameter of 
the bored hole and 
the opening of the bored hole (6, 22, 23, 23') is 
hermetically closed by means of welding, 
 
characterized in that
 
the fillet (7, 7', 7'' cup 15) which in thickness (a) is 

significantly smaller than the plug (dimension B) is punched 
out of a single metal sheet and is made of a material which 

is more favourably priced and lighter than the other 
workable valve raw materials, on the upper side, is inserted 

set back in the bored hole (6, 22, 23, 23') to approximately 
the same distance from the edge of the open end of the bored 

hole (free head face 9) as the thickness of the wall 
(dimension B) of the plug (8, 8', 8''),
 
the plug (8, 8', 8'') closing the opening of the bored hole 

(6, 22, 23, 23') is produced by means of deposit welding 
(fig. 5) by the addition of the mass of the plug (8, 8', 

8'') as a settling, alloyed, thermically highly resistant 
material in wire or flux form,
  
 

whereby with the fillet (7, 7', 7'', cup 15) which is set 
back, the welding melt is held only on the end face of the 

bored hole (6, 22, 23, 23'). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
the deposit welding is carried out employing a welding 

process by which the workpiece (1) is disposed externally to 
and electrically passively in relation to the valve material 

welding energy flux which melts. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
deposit welding is carried out using laser welding (fig. 

11). 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
deposit welding is carried out by means of electron beam 

welding (fig. 12 or 13). 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
deposit welding is carried out by means of gas welding (fig. 

14). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
deposit welding (fig. 5) is carried out by means of inert 

gas shielded arc welding using a tungsten electrode. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
deposit welding (fig. 5) is carried out by means of inert 

gas metal-arc welding. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
deposit welding (fig. 5) is carried out by means of plasma-flux 

welding.  
 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the bo
red hole (6) in the valve shaft (3) is bored 
and closed towards the head face. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that before inserting the fillet (7, 7', 7'', cup 15) 

info the bored hole (6) a coolant (18) is introduced (fig. 
3). 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the fillet (7, 7', 7'', cup 15) is 

manufactured from unalloyed steel. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the fillet (7, 7', 7'') is formed as 

flat platinum. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the fillet is formed as a truncated-cone 

shaped cup (15) and is inserted into the bored hole (6, 
23') with the closed face (16) showing towards the outside. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the fillet (7) is driven into the 

bored hole (6) to a specific depth and adheres therein as a 
force fit. 
Process according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that a shoulder (13, 14, 14') is applied to 

the bored hole, the depth of insertion of the inserted 
fillet (7, 7', 7'') being defined by said shoulder against 

which said fillet is held in a form-locking fashion.
