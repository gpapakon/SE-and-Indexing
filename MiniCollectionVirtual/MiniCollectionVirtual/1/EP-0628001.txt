 CLEAT RETAINING BOLT AND NUT FOR VEHICLE ENDLESS TRACKBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field:The field of the invention is endless track assemblies for snow grooming vehicles, and more particularly the cleat assemblies thereof, including structures for fastening the cleats to the flexible plastic belting of such tracks.2. State of the Art:Snow groomer vehicles use endless tracks made up of flexible plastic belts made continuous by lacing their ends together. Actual lacing thread may be used, although lacing joint assemblies are more commonly employed, being a combination of metallic hinge plates and an associated hinge pin. The snow grooming vehicle commonly has an endless track assembly on each of its sides , each comprising a number of fabric reinforced plastic belts. The belts are spaced apart to provide a broad base for the track while utilizing minimum amounts of belting. Steel cleat assemblies are bolted across the individual belts at intervals, tieing them together into a track assembly. Each assembled track is engaged by a power-transmitting sprocket wheel, which forces the "belts to travel together around a set of guiding wheels called bogies. The powered belt imparts horizontal shear forces to the cleats, which engage the snow to propel - the vehicle. Extensive development has gone into the design of the elongate cleat members, with the objectives of pro¬ viding maximum forward traction, along with substantial 

resistance to side slipping. Cleat constructions are dis¬ closed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,765,731, 4,560,211, 4,281,882 and 4,059,315. Typically, the ground contacting cleat, also called a "grouser", is fastened to the outside of the flexible belting by bolt and nut assemblies installed in matching holes in the grouser, the belt, and a metal backing plate on the inside of the belt. A large number of bolt and nut assemblies are required to spread the high shearing forces among the b©lt holes. The horizontal force on the grou engaging part of the cleat also results in high moment loads which must be resisted by the stems of the bolts. Failure of the bolts in bending is a too frequent common occurence, and is largely caused by the moment force applied to the portion of the stem at the junction of the threads and the unthreaded shank, resulting in stress concentration.A cleat assembly design of greater strength is needed, particularly incorporating a bolt and nut assembly not susceptible to bending fracture at the threaded portions.

<CLAIMS>
1. A cleat to be mounted upon the flexible belting of a vehicle endless track, the track comprising at least one endless flexible belt carrying longitudinally spaced sets of holes for mounting the cleat transversely to the belt, said cleat comprising: an elongate grouser plate having a generally planar belt contacting portion, having mounting holes therethrough matching the holes of one of the sets carried by the belt; an elongate backing plate laterally spanning the belt, and having holes matching the mounting holes of the grouser; a mounting bolt operable through each of the matching holes to secure the backing plate, the belt and the grouser together, said bolt having an enlarged head portion and an elongate unthreaded shank portion extending a substantial distance beyond the grouser mounting hole to join with an end portion carrying external threads; and a torque nut having an elongate body spanning from the bolt threads to the grouser, having a longitudinal bore therethrough with an internally threaded end portion joining an unthreaded, shank clearing, portion, the latter spanning from the threaded portion to an opposite, grouser- bearing end thereof. 


 2. The cleat of claim 1, further comprising: an elongate rigid member retaining the torque nuts non-rotatably, spaced apart in matching relationship to the grouser mounting holes.
3. The cleat of claim 2, wherein: the nut retaining member comprises an elongate channel member having a pair of parallel leg portions extending from a connecting web member toward the belt contacting portion of the grouser plate; wherein a grouser bearing end portion of each nut carries at least one pair of opposed parallel faces spaced apart to allow closely clearing insertion of the nut between the channel leg portions, each face carrying a depression; an opposite,threaded end,portion of the nut joining with the grouser bearing portion thereof, having a circular cross section; a threaded end portion receiving bore through the web of the channel at each cleat mounting hole, and a pair of opposed, inwardly projecting, dimples at each nut re¬ ceiving hole; so that the nuts may be inserted into and retained within the channel in bolt receiving positions.
