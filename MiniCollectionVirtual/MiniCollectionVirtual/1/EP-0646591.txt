<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 3- or 4-glycosyloxybenzopyran derivatives which 
are obtained by glycosylation reaction of the 3- or 4-position hydroxyl group of a 
benzopyran derivative with a hexose derivative. These compounds or 
physiologically acceptable salts thereof are useful as antiallergic agents. Benzopyran derivatives as the aglycon moiety of the 3- or 4-glycosyloxybenzopyran 
derivatives of the present invention have been disclosed 
for example in EP-A-0598117 by the present inventors, and similar benzopyran 
derivatives for example in J. Med. Chem., vol.31, pp.1437 - 1445, 1988, by 
Donald T. Witiak and in U.S. Patent 4,845,121, but nothing about the 3- or 4-glycosyloxybenzopyran 
derivatives as their 3- or 4-position glycosides. In 
addition to this, nothing is known about the antiallergic activity of the 3- or 4-glycosyloxybenzopyran 
derivatives of the present invention and physiologically 
acceptable salts thereof. Since antiallergic agents so far available commercially are not satisfactory 
in terms of efficiency, safety and bioavailability, studies on the development of 
antiallergic agents have been carried out extensively. For example, a typical 
antiallergic agent, Tranilast (general name), requires high-dose administration 
for care of allergic disease, though its acute toxicity value (LD50) in mice is low 
(780 mg/kg), hence causing a problem of requiring caution at the time of its use 
because of the closeness between quantities of its efficacy and toxicity, namely 
its narrow safety range. Also, Disodium Cromoglicate (general name) as a well 
known antiasthamtic agent whose efficacy has been confirmed clinically is  
 
satisfactory in terms of its toxicity, but must be used by spray inhalation due to its 
extremely poor gastrointestinal absorbability. In addition, these known 
antiallergic agents are not effective on delayed type allergy, though they are 
effective on immediate type allergy. Chronic state of allergic diseases including 
asthma and atopic dermatitis is a serious problem, and the delayed type allergy 
is deeply concerned in the development of the chronic state. In consequence, a 
drug which is effective on both immediate type allergy and delayed type allergy is 
desirable as an antiallergic agent. As it is universally known, steroid is effective 
on both immediate type allergy and delayed type allergy but cause extremely 
serious side effects. As has been described above, most of the antiallergic agents so far 
reported have various disadvantages, because they cannot
