<ABSTRACT>
The torque measurement device is interposed between a motor assembly (2) and a load assembly (3) and comprises:   - a means for measuring the torque transmitted between the motor assembly (2) or the load assembly (3), - a means for measuring the torque taken up or yielded by the angular acceleration of the rotational masses located between the means for measuring the transmitted torque and the location where the torque is being investigated, - a means for algebraically adding the value of these two torques, the result of this algebraic addition being representative of the value of the torque under investigation at the predetermined location, this value would be the one obtained if the measurement could be carried out in strictly steady-state regime.
