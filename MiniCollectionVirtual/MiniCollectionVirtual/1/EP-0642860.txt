<ABSTRACT>
The device has a tension piece (2) displaceable in the direction of the spindle axis (1') and a likewise displaceable actuating member (3) which is acted upon in the clamping direction of the tension piece (2) by a clamping spring (4) and is supported against its force on the tension piece (2) via clamping wedges (5), for which bearing surfaces (6, 7) inclined towards one another are provided on the tension piece (2) and on the actuating member (3). Furthermore, the clamping wedges (5) can be supported on a supporting sleeve (8), connected to the work spindle (1), in bearing surfaces (9) and are positively guided on the bearing surfaces (6) of the actuating member (3) in such a way that they are carried along by the actuating member (3), even during its displacement against the direction of force of the clamping spring (4), right into a radially inner position relative to the spindle axis (1'). In this position, they can be retracted into the hollow inner space of the supporting sleeve (8) during the further displacement of the actuating member (3) against the direction of force of the clamping spring (4), in the course of which they bear with their radially outer surface (10) against the inner surface (11) of the supporting sleeve (8).

An arrangement for actuating a clamping head which is arranged on
a working spindle (1) for workpieces or tools, in particular steep-angle

taper tools, having a pulling portion (2) of the clamping head, which is
displaceable in the direction of the axis (1') of the working spindle (1),

and an actuating member (3) which is likewise displaceable and which is
urged in the clamping direction of the pulling portion (2) by a clamping

spring (4) and is supported against the force thereof against the pulling
portion (2) b
y way of clamping taper members (5) for which the pulling
portion (2) and the actuating member (3) are provided with inclined

contact surfaces (6, 7) in opposite relationship, of which the contact
surface (7) on the pulling portion (2) is approximately perpendicular to

the spindle axis (1') and the contact surfaces (6) on the actuating member
(3) are inclined from the outside inwardly in the direction of force of

the clamping spring (4) relative to the spindle axis (1'), wherein the
clamping taper members (5) can be supported against a support sleeve (8)

which is disposed in opposite relationship to the contact surfaces (6, 7)
and which is connected to the working spindle (1), in contact surfaces (9)

which are inclined from the inside outwardly in the direction of force of
the clamping spring (4) with respect to the spindle axis (1'),

characterised in that there is provided a positive guide means for
displacing the clamping taper members (5) against the contact surfaces (6)

of the actuating member (3) upon the displacement of the actuating member
(3) which occurs in the opposite direction to the direction of force of

the clamping spring (4), into a position which is radially inward with
respect to the spindle axis (1'), and that in the radially inward position

upon further displacement of the actuating member (3) in the opposite
direction to the direction of force of the clamping spring (8) the

clamping taper members (5) can be pulled into the hollow interior of the
support sleeve (8), in which case they bear with their radially outer

surface (10) against the inside surface (11) of the support sleeve (8). 
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that provided
in each of the contact surfaces (6) of the actuating member (3) is a guide

groove (20) of undercut configuration which forms the positive guide means
for one of the clamping taper members (5) and into which the clamping

taper member (5) engages in positively locking relationship with a guide
foot (21).
An arrangement according to claim 2 characterised in that the
guide groove (20) and the guide foot (21) are of a dovetail-shaped

configuration.
An arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in
that the contact surfaces (9) on the support sleeve (8) for each clamping

taper member (5) are formed by the bottom of a guide groove (22) against
whose lateral groove walls (23) the clamping taper member (5) bears with

mutually parallel side surfaces (24).
An arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in
that the contact surfaces (6) on the pulling portion (2) and the contact

surfaces (9) on the support sleeve (8) include with each other an angle
which is so small that the clamping taper member (5) is held between them

in the unclamping direction in a self-locking condition.
An arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in
that the part (2.2) of the pulling portion (2), which carries the contact

surface (7) and the actuating member (3) are arranged coaxially in
succession and the clamping taper members (5) are arranged between them

distributed uniformly over the periphery, wherein the actuating member (3)
is in the form of a tubular portion which is coaxial with the support

sleeve (8).
An arrangement according to claim 6 characterised in that the
pulling portion (2) comprises a pulling plate (2.2) which carries its

contact surface (7) and a pulling bar (2.1) which is connected thereto, 
wherein the actuating member (3) annularly surrounds the clamping bar (2)

and axially displaceably guided in the pulling plate (2.2) are clamping
thrust members (17) which engage through between the clamping taper

members (5) and which bear at one end against the actuating member (3) and
at the other end butt against a power-actuated control piston (16) on the

side of the pulling plate (2.2) which is opposite to the actuating member
(3).
