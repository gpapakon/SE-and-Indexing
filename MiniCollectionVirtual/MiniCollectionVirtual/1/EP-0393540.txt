<ABSTRACT>
The essence of the proposed process for electroplating surface segments situated on the surface of an object is that the surface of the object (1) is first provided by mechanical means with a corrugation or knurling (3, 4) which is coated with an insulating material (6). Exposed surface segments (7) are then produced by stripping the surface and these are electroplated. The insulating material in between is then removed. This makes it possible, for example, in the case of grinding tools on which an electroplated layer containing abrasive particles is to be deposited, to keep the segments small and to create gaps for receiving cuttings which are recessed with respect to the surface segments.

Process for galvanically coating of surface segments that are 
situated on the surface of a basic body, 
characterized in that
 
the surface of the basic body (1) is first provided mechanically 

with a ribbing or knurling (3, 4) wich is coated with an 
insulating material (6) such as a lacquer and bare surface 

segments (7) are then created by cutting of the surface which 
are then galvanically coated and that the insulating material 

(6) situated between the coated surface segments (7) is 
removed thereafter. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
surface is coated with a synthetic resin lacquer (6) such as 

acrylic resin. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
ribbing (4) is made up of pyramidal bodies (5). 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
electro-plated layer (8) contains abrasive grains (9). 
Process according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
electro-plated layer (8) contains diamond grains (9). 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
ribbing (4) is produced by placing material of the basic body 

(1) into a cylindrical mould (14) composed of several parts, 
the inner wall of which is provided with a ribbing (15) or 

knurling.  
 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized
 by the use of a 
basic body (1), the core (12) of which is made of another 

material than its outer metallic ring (13). 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the core 
(12) is made of a metall or synthetic resin and the outer ring 

(13) of a synthetic resin with a metallic filler. 
Tool, the basic body of which bears surface segments on its 
metallic surface, 
characterized
 by an electro-plated coating 
(8) of the surface segments (7) according to a process 

according to claim 1. 
Grinding wheel consisting of a basic body which bears surface 
segments on its metallic surface, 
characterized
 by an electroplated 
coating (8) with abrasive grains (9) on the surface 

segments (7) according to a process according to claim 1.
