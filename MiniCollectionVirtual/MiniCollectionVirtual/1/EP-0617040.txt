<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an improved process for producing diesters of 
phosphorous acid. The process comprises (a) reacting phosphorous acid with monohydric 

alcohol in a petroleum distillate solvent while maintaining a reaction mass temperature 
within the range of from 130° to 138°C, and (b) refluxing the reaction mass during the 

reaction, wherein the phosphorous acid contains more than 10 up to 35 wt.% water, the 
molar ratio of alcohol to phosphorous acid used is within the range of from 2.0:1 to 4.0:1, 

and water is removed from the reaction mass essentially as it is formed during steps (b) 
and (c).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cost-effective, commercially feasible process for 
preparing dihydrocarbyl esters of phosphorous acid. Dihydrocarbyl esters of phosphorous acid, such as dibutyl hydrogen phosphite 
are useful as gear lubricant additives as is or they may be further reacted with elemental 
sulfur to form an intermediate reactive product. The intermediate reactive product can 
then be reacted with an amine, olefin, or alkylene oxide to obtain a desired lube oil additive. Processes for preparing dihydrocarbyl phosphites are well known. Alkyl 
phosphites may be prepared by the reaction of alcohols and alkali metal alkoxides with 
phosphorus trichloride and with phosphorus trioxide. However, reactions of trivalent 
phosphorus derivatives are known to be more complex and more difficult to control than 
reactions involving the corresponding pentavalent phosphorus derivatives. Baker, et al., U.S. Patent No. 2,670,368 and GB Patent No. 699,154 disclose 
the direct esterification of phosphorous acid with monohydric alcohols. According to Baker, 
et al., alkyl phosphites, principally dialkyl phosphites, may be produced in good yield 
without the formation of excessive quantities of ethers, olefins, and other undesirable 
products by esterification of the alcohol with phosphorous acid under such conditions that 
the water present and formed during the esterification is removed continuously. Continuous 
removal of water is achieved by the use of a solvent which forms a ternary azeotropic 
mixture with water and the alcohol. The phosphorous acid used in the Baker, et al. process 
is obtained by concentrating a more dilute acid, for example, concentrating commercial 
70 percent acid whereby a solid product containing 90 percent or more H₃PO₃ is usually 
formed. Previously, it was believed that it was necessary to utilize concentrated or 
solid phosphorous acid whereby water is removed from the acid prior to initiation of the 
reaction between phosphorous acid and monohydric alcohol. It has now been discovered 
that phosphorous acid solutions containing more than 10 up to 35 wt.% water, preferably 
from 20 to 30 wt.% water, can be reacted with monohydric alcohol without first 
concentrating the acid to 90 wt.% or more. This discovery has led to a dramatic decrease 
in reaction time, without adversely affecting the yield or purity of diester product thus  
 
produced. Accordingly, the reaction can be completed in as little as 4 to 10 hours in 
laboratory scale reactions. Previous attempts utilizing solid
