<ABSTRACT>
The metal golf club head (10) includes a main 
body (12) and a sole plate (14). The main body (12) has 

a front wall (22) arranged for impacting a golf ball, a 
top wall (16), a bottom wall (18) with an opening (28) 

formed therein, and a rear wall (20). The sole plate 
(14) closes the opening (28) in the bottom wall (18) of 

the main body (12). A circular ridge (30,32,34,36) 
circumscribes the main body opening (28) and projects 

downwardly from the main body (12). The sole plate (14) 
has a circular ridge (46) extending around its periphery 

and projecting downwardly. When the sole plate (14) is 
inserted in the main body opening (28), the circular 

ridges (30,32,34,36;46) on the main body (12) and the 
sole plate (14) are juxtaposed. Then, these circular 

ridges are fused together in order to affix the sole 
plate (14) to the main body (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to golf clubs and, in 
particular, to a method of assembling a metal golf club head. U.S. Patent No. 4,465,221 to Schmidt discloses a method 
of making a metal golf club head having a main body and a 
sole plate. The main body of the club head has an opening 
formed in its bottom wall as a result of an investment 
casting process used in making the main body. A ledge 
circumscribes the opening for supporting the sole plate 
during a welding operation. A welded joint is formed in a 
gap between the main body and the sole plate in order to 
affix the sole plate to the main body. A drawback of the 
method disclosed in the Schmidt patent is that the ledge used 
to support the sole plate becomes distorted during the 
investment casting process and thus does not properly support 
the sole plate. Furthermore, this ledge is difficult, if not 
impossible, to straighten. Another drawback of providing a 
ledge to support the sole plate during the welding operation 
is that the bottom wall of the main body must be thicker than 
otherwise required. A further drawback of the prior method 
is that the sole plate is not fully secured to the ledge even 
though the sole plate rests on the ledge during the welding 
operation.  
 The present invention provides a method of assembling a 
metal golf club head comprising the step of providing a main 
body formed of metal having a front wall-with a face arranged 
for impacting a golf ball, a top wall, a bottom wall with an 
opening formed therein, and a rear wall. The main body has a 
ridge circumscribing the opening in the bottom wall and 
projecting outwardly from the bottom wall. The method also 
comprises the step of providing a sole plate formed of metal 
for closing the opening in the bottom wall of the main body. 
The sole plate has a ridge extending around its periphery and 
projecting outwardly therefrom. The sole plate is inserted 
in the opening in the main body bottom wall so that the 
opening is closed by the sole plate and so that the ridges on 
the main body and the sole plate are juxtaposed. The 
juxtaposed ridges are fused together in order to affix the 
sole plate to the main body. In its preferred embodiment, the method of the present 
invention further comprises the steps of providing a 
plurality of notches in the ridge on the main body thereby 
dividing the main body ridge into a plurality of arcuate 
ridge sections, providing a plurality of locator tabs on the 
sole plate, and positioning the sole plate and the main body

<CLAIMS>
A method of assembling a metal golf club head (10) 
comprising the steps of:
 
   providing a main body (12) formed of metal having a front 

wall (22) with a face (26) arranged for impacting a golf ball, a top 
wall (16), a bottom wall (18) with an opening (28) formed therein, and a 

rear wall (20), said main body (12) having a ridge (30, 32, 34, 36) 
circumscribing the 

opening (28) in said bottom wall (18) and projecting outwardly from 
said bottom wall (18);
 
   providing a sole plate (14) formed of metal for closing the 

opening (28) in said bottom wall (18) of said main body (12), said sole 
plate (14) having a ridge (46) extending around its periphery and 

projecting outwardly therefrom;
 
   inserting said sole plate (14) in the opening (28) in said main 

body bottom wall (18) so that said opening (28) is closed by said sole 
plate (14) and so that said ridges (30, 32, 34, 36; 46) on said main 

body (12) and said sole 
plate (14) are juxtaposed; and
 
   fusing said ridges (30, 32, 34, 36; 46) together in order to affix 

said sole 
plate (14) to said main body (12). 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step 
of removing any excess metal where said ridges (30, 32, 34, 36; 46) 

were located 
on the main body (12) and the sole plate (14), and wherein the removing 

step is performed after the fusing step.  
 
The method of claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising 
the steps of:
 
   providing a plurality of notches (38, 40, 42, 44) in the ridge 

(30, 32, 34, 36) on said 
main body (12) thereby dividing said main body ridge into a 

plurality of ridge sections (30; 32; 34; 36);
 
   providing a plurality of locator tabs (48, 50, 52, 54) on said sole 

plate (14); and
 
   positioning said sole plate (14) and said main body (12), during 

said inserting step, so that said locator tabs (48, 50, 52, 54) are 
disposed 

in said notches (38, 40, 42, 44). 
The method of claim 3, wherein said notches (38, 40, 42, 44) are 
spaced unevenly around a circumference of said opening (28), and 

wherein said locator tabs (48, 50, 52, 54) are spaced unevenly around the 
periphery of the sole plate (14) so that said sole plate (14) has a 

registered fit within said opening (28). 
The method of claim 3 or claim 4, wherein said plurality of 
notches (38, 40, 42, 44) comprises four notches, and wherein said 

plurality of 
locator tabs (48, 50, 52, 54) comprises four locator tabs. 
The method of any one of claims 3 to 5, wherein said ridge 
sections (30, 32, 34, 36)

and an approximate width of 1.91 mm (0.075 inch).  

 
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the main body opening (28) 
is substantially circular, and further comprising the step of 

machining the main body opening (28) to make it perfectly 
circular, the machining step being performed before the
