<ABSTRACT>
In order to reproduce the desired capacity for transferring printing ink of an anilox roller, even after it has been worn out, such as is caused, for example, by the interaction of the surface of the screen roller with a doctor blade in an ink supply unit with an ink chamber, the screen roller has depressions or wells (14a) to receive the printing ink in its surface, the depth of which is substantially greater than is necessary to obtain the appropriate volume to retain a suitable quantity of ink which is to be transferred to a printing carrier with a desired printing intensity. Before the printing ink is introduced into the cells (14a), the latter are filled with a removable filler material (20), for example copper, a plastic, for example polyethylene, epoxy resin, wax or the like. When the surface of the webs or edges or cell walls has been worn out, some of the filler material (20) is removed, for example by laser evaporation, etching or the like, in order to reproduce the original volume to receive the ink.

Process for controlling and adjusting the quantity 
of printing ink available for ink transfer from a 

screen roller (6, 6'') whose surface is provided with 
recesses or cells (14), which are partially filled with 

a filling material (20) so as to predetermine an 
available volume for filling the recesses or cells (14) 

with printing ink, strips or ridges (16) existing 
between the recesses or cells (14) and the screen 

roller (6, 6') being engaged against at least one 
doctor blade (7a, 7b), causing surface abrasion and 

erosion of surfaces (17) of the screen roller (6, 6'), 
characterised in that after the screen roller (6, 6') 

has been in operation in the printing machine for a 
preset time period with an abrasion of the screen 

roller (6, 6') corresponding to this operating period 
and with the reduction of the diameter of the strips or 

ridges (16) between the recesses or cells (14) in a 
radial direction, which leads to a reduction of the 

volume of ink in the recesses or cells (14), the 
available volume of recesses or cells (14) is 

reproduced, by reducing the quantity of filling 
material (20). 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the available volume is increased by ablation of 

at least one part of the filling material (20) inside 
the recesses or cells (14), in particular by removing a 

part of the filling material (20) by etching or 
irradiation of the filling material (20) with a laser. 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that all the filling material (20) is removed from 

the recesses or cells (14), after the volume has been  
 

reduced through wear, and in that the recesses or 
cells (14) are refilled in a second filling step with 

filling material (20), the amount of filler however 
being smaller than that used initially, the filling 

material (20) in particular being a meltable material 

and the removal of the filling material (20) including 
a melting of the filling material (20); or in that the 

filling material (20) is particularly soluble in a 
fluid and is dissolved in or washed out with this, so 

that a smaller quantity of filling material (20) 
remains in the cells (14), or in that the filling 

material (20), in a smaller quantity, is once again 
filled into the cells (14). 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the print density is set after a 

certain operational period of the screen roller (6, 6') 
and that when the print density suddenly decreases the 

volume of the cells (14) is increased again. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a screen roller (6, 6') is used, 

whose base body (12) is preferably made of steel and 
which has a surface layer (13) made of a surface-treatable 

material, particularly of ceramics or copper, 
recesses or cells (14) being formed in the layer (13), 

which are respectively partially filled with a filling 
material (20). 
Screen roller (6, 6') for use in a process 
according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 

that the filling material (20) is a plastic, preferably 
polyethylene or a two-component adhesive material, 

preferably epoxy resin. 
Screen roller (6, 6') according to claim 6,  
 

characterised in that the outer surfaces or the ridges 
or strips (16), which form the outer surface of the 

screen roller (6, 6'), are hydrophilic. 
Screen roller (6, 6') according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the ridges or strips (16), which 

are formed between the recesses or cells (14), contain 
a wear-resistant material, preferably chromium oxide or 

aluminium oxide. 
Screen roller (6, 6') according to one of claims 6 
to 8, characterised in that the layer (13) has a 

thickness corresponding to at least three times and 
preferably ten times the depth (H1) of the recesses or 

cells (14). 
Screen roller (6, 6') according to one of claims 6 
to 9, characterised in that the inner walls of the 

recesses or cells (14) are provided with a lining (15). 
Screen roller (6, 6') according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the layer (15) is made of copper.
