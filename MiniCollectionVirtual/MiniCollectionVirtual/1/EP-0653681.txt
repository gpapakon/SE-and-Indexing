<ABSTRACT>
A novel resist composition is disclosed. The resist composition is used 
in a lithographic process for device fabrication. The resist composition contains a 

polymer with phosphorus ester moieties. These moieties make the resist 
composition suitable for use in a variety of lithographic processes for fabricating 

integrated circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to polymeric energy sensitive materials
and a process for device fabrication that utilizes these materials.Lithographic processes are commonly used to fabricate integrated
circuits and other devices. In lithographic processes, a latent image is introduced
into an energy sensitive resist material ("resist"). The incident energy is introduced
into the resist in a patternwise manner, the pattern corresponding to the desired
image. The incident energy induces a chemical change in the resist. Frequently, this
chemical change is augmented by a post-exposure bake (PEB). This chemical
change does not significantly occur in the portions of the resist that are not exposed
to energy. The chemical difference between the unexposed and the exposed areas of
the resist, known as the chemical contrast, is then exploited to develop the latent
image introduced into the resist by the incident energy.The energy-induced chemical contrast between the unexposed region
and the exposed region of a resist material is enhanced by a process referred to as
chemical amplification. In chemical amplification, the effect of exposing the resist
to energy is chemically enhanced. Examples of chemically amplified resists are
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,200,544 to Houlihan et al. and U.S. Patent No.
4,491,628 to Frechet et al.Chemically amplified resists frequently use moieties which are cleaved
from the resist in the presence of light (photolabile) or acid (acid labile) as a
mechanism for introducing the desired contrast into the resist. These moieties, when
pendant to certain functional groups, "protect" the functional groups. "Protect"
means that when the moieties are attached to the functional groups, the resist does
not exhibit the activity associated with these functional groups. When the moieties
are cleaved from the resist, the functional groups are unblocked and the resist then
exhibits the activity associated with the functional groups.It is advantageous if the chemical contrast is introduced without extreme
changes in the resist volume. For example, cleavage and volatilization of protecting
groups results in shrinkage of the resist because of the mass loss. This shrinkage
will cause distortion of pattern features and loss of resolution. Although a certain
amount of shrinkage and distortion is tolerated, it is advantageous if the resist 
shrinks less than 20% by volume during deprotection and subsequent processing.
Therefore, polymers that shrink less during deprotection are desired.A resist

A process for fabricating a device comprising an energy sensitive material
comprising:


i) providing a radiation-sensitive material comprising a material including (1) a
polymer that is the polymerization product of one or more monomers, wherein at least

one of the monomers is selected from the group consisting of phosphonate ester
monomers and phosphate ester monomers, and (2) a photoacid generator;
ii) exposing a region on said radiation-sensitive material to radiation, which
causes said photoacid generator in said exposed region to generate an acidic moiety, to

define an image of a pattern in said radiation-sensitive material;
iii) subjecting said radiation-sensitive material to a post exposure bake thereby
convening a substantial portion of the phosphonate ester moieties and the phosphate ester

moieties to phosphorus acid moieties;
iv) developing said pattern in said radiation-sensitive material.
The process of claim 1 wherein the phosphonate ester and phosphate ester
monomers have the general structure:



wherein R
1
 is chosen such that the O-R
1
 bond cleaves in the presence of acid to form a
carbonium ion that is sufficiently stable to eliminate an available Î±-hydrogen and R
2
 is 
the same or different from R
1
 but is not hydrogen, n is an integer greater than or equal to
one, and X is a polymerizable moiety containing ethylenic unsaturation.
The process of claim 2, wherein R
1
 is selected from alkyl, substituted
alkyl, and aryl alkyl, and/or wherein the polymerizable moiety containing ethylenic

unsaturation is selected from vinyl, vinylbenzyl and vinylphenyl.
The process of claim 1, further comprising introducing an etch selectivity
between the area of the radiation sensitive region exposed to radiation and the area of the

radiation sensitive region not exposed to radiation by introducing a composition
containing a refractory material onto the radiation sensitive region after the radiation

sensitive region has been exposed to radiation and binding a significantly greater amount
of refractory material to the polymer in the exposed region than in the unexposed region.
The process of claim 1, further comprising introducing a color difference
between the area of the radiation sensitive region exposed to radiation and the area of the

radiation sensitive region not exposed to radiation by introducing a dye composition that
is selectively incorporated onto and into polymers that are more acidic than the

polymerization product, thereby incorporating a greater amount of the dye onto and into
the polymerization product in the exposed region of the radiation sensitive region than in

the unexposed region of the radiation sensitive region.
