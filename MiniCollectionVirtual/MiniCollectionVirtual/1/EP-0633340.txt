<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a machine for dyeing fabrics 
wound up into cords using the overflow 

or jet system, comprising 
two or more overflow (10,11,12,13) or jet units arranged in series 

in a single tank (1), in which the speed of the various reels of 
each overflow or jet device is synchronized with respect to 

a driving reel by affixing permanent magnets to the fabric 
and appropriate sensors (27,28,29,30) on the machine 

so that possible 
slipping of the fabric can be corrected by a microprocessor 

drive control system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art field of machines for
dyeing fabrics wound up into cords with the overflow or jet
system or with a combined overflow and jet system. More
particularly, the invention discloses a machine for dyeing
fabrics wound up into cords by means of the passage of the
fabric through two or more overflow or jet devices arranged
in series (see for example EP-A-310013, upon which the
preamble of claim 1 is based).Prior art envisages overflow or jet machines for dyeing
fabrics wound up into cords, essentially comprising a reel
that lifts the fabric, in a closed loop, from the underlying
collection tank and:
in the case of the overflow system, introduces the fabric
into a funnel into which the dyebath liquor is poured and
circulated by means of a pump and heated by virtue of its
passage through a heat exchanger before reaching the overflow
funnel. The funnel is followed by a tube through which the
fabric floats and is caused to advance by the flow of dyebath
liquor arriving from the funnel before falling into the tank
where it is arranged in layers or allowed to accumulate; it
is then picked up by the reel. After a certain number of
passages through the overflow funnel, and after having been
immersed in the dyebath at an increasingly high temperature,
the dyed fabric is extracted from the machine.The overflow system is generally utilised for delicate fabrics 
so the procedure is slow in that the pressure at which
the dyebath liquor is directed against the fabric is the same
pressure as that resulting from the pouring of the fluid into
the funnel so the fabric moves very slowly through the machine.
in the case of the jet dyeing system, which is used for
more resistant fabrics, the fabric is subjected to a pressurised
jet of dyebath liquor in a similar machine to the
overflow dyeing machine, so that it circulates at considerably
higher speed than the speed obtained in the overflow
system and, since dyeing is completed after a certain number
of passages of the fabric through the overflow or jet device,
the greater the speed of translation, the fewer the dyeing
passages required. Machines employing the foregoing systems are able, in addition
to dyeing, to perform other dyeshop operations such as
washing, stripping, bleaching, and so forth.Prior art also envisages so-called continuous machines comprising
several overflow or jet devices arranged in series,
whereby the fabric is fed in at the start of the series and
withdrawn at the end; such systems are mainly used for washing,
stripping or

<CLAIMS>
A machine for dyeing fabrics wound up into cords,
comprising two or more overflow or jet devices (10,11,12,13)

arranged in series in a single tank (1), characterised in that the speed of the
various reels (2,3,4,5) of each overflow or jet device is synchronised with

respect to a driving reel (denominated "master" in current international
terminology) in such a way that any slipping of the

fabric on any of the dependent reels (denominated "slaves" in
current international terminology) is corrected by the machine

microprocessor control unit, this action being achieved by monitoring
the passage of the fabric to be dyed in the various overflow

or jet devices arranged in series, the fabric having been previously arranged
with its ends joined to form a loop and having been

divided, in the preparatory stages, into the same number of equal
length sections as there are overflow or jet units in the machine,

and a each section having been subsequently fitted with a
permanent magnet which relays a signal to a sensor (27,28,29,30), located

externally to each overflow or jet device (10,11,12,13), on each passage
through the selfsame overflow or jet device, said signal being

received by the microprocessor control unit, and using prior art
systems to cause, whenever necessary, a variation of the speed of

the slave reel with respect to the speed of the master reel in
such a way that the passage of the various permanent magnets

through all the overflow or jet devices (10,11,12,13) making up the machine
takes place simultaneously and therefore the passage of each 

section of fabric in which the fabric
is divided, through each overflow or jet device (10,11,12,13) in the machine,

takes place within an identical time interval in all
cases.
A machine for dyeing fabrics wound up into cords as in
claim 1, wherein the signals generated by the successive

passages of the permanent magnets through the various over-flow
or jet devices (10,11,12,13) are received by the machine microprocessor

control unit in such a way that the increase in temperature
of the dyebath liquor, the delivery rate of the pump and

also the immission of dyestuff or other products necessary to
the dyeing process, are automatically adjusted in accordance

with the number of passages so that it is possible to alter
the translation speed of the fabric during the process.
A machine for dyeing fabrics wound up into cords as in
claim 1, characterised in that in one dyebath of parallelepiped
