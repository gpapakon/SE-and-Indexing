<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to slides for sport or 
play, for example for skating or other activity requiring 
low friction so as to facilitate sliding or gliding. Presently sport or play activities requiring a low 
friction support, for example skating, takes place on 
artificial skating grounds or on natural ice. Artificial 
ice grounds involve high investment costs, and solely the 
cooling plant for a conventional ice ground amounts presently 
to several million SEK. To this comes high operational 
costs which for cooling only are estimated to about 
half a million SEK per year. The season for a conventional 
artificial ice ground is often not more than about seven 
months, and during periods with high daytime temperatures 
it is often uneconomical. An artificial skating ground is 
furthermore restricted to a specific geographic location 
and is thus useful only at the site where the cooling 
tubes are cast into the support. Another inconvenience with artificial ice grounds is 
the fact that the cooling equipment uses cooling media 
containing ammonia and water containing salts. The ammonia 
will have to be replaced at frequent intervals and the 
waste is considered as an environmental hazard and must be 
especially treated according to the environmental laws. Furthermore, the usefulness of today's artificial ice 
grounds is very limited. When the outdoor temperature exceeds 
about 10°C artificial ice grounds function only indoors 
within an enclosure. This, however, results in very 
high operational costs. In practice an iceground can be 
used only if the surface of the ice has a temperature of 
between about -1°C and -20°C. In countries having a high 
average temperature skating is virtually impossible to 
practice.  
 As prior art reference is made to DE-A-3 445 976 and 
US-A-3,726,817 which disclose slides based on wax and polymer 
but which do not suggest the presence of any crack resistance-imparting 
mineral.  
 The present invention has for an object to provide 
slides for sport and play which involve essentially reduced 
investment and operational costs and furthermore are  
 
capable of operation within a much broader temperature 
range. Another object of the invention is to provide slides 
which are easy to restore and the friction coefficient 
and surface hardness of which can be modified according to 
the activity involved. Still another object of the invention 
is to provide slides which show improved non-cracking 
characeristics.  
 For these and other objects which will be clear
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A slide for sport or play, for example for skating 
or other activity requiring low friction, comprising 

a surface layer that has been formed by the solidification 
of a melted mixture based on a wax and a polymer, characterized 

in that said mixture comprises more than 40% by 
weight of said wax in the form of a natural and/or synthetic 

hard wax, 5-30% by weight of said polymer and 5-40% by 
weight of a crack resistance-imparting mineral, said percentages 

being based on the weight of the total composition. 
A slide according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said surface layer has a hardness of about 0-15 measured 

with needle penetration according to DIN 51579 or 
Norm ASTM 1321 at +20°C. 
A slide according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that said mixture has a melting point of from about 80 

to about 180°C, preferably about 90 to about 140°C, especially 
about 100 to about 130°C. 
A slide according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the viscosity of said mixture 

at 140°C is about 1000-100000 cSt, preferably 2000-50000 
cSt. 
A slide according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said hard wax constitutes 

more than 50, % by weight, based on the total composition. 
A slide according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said hard wax comprises 

technique waxes, microwaxes, polyethylene waxes, 
and/or paraffin waxes. 
A slide according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said polymer comprises 

polyethylene, polypropylene, and/or nylon.  
 
A slide according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said mineral comprises 

talcum and/or mica or any synthetic equivalent thereof, 
such as inorganic oxide, inorganic phosphate, inorganic 

carbonate and/or inorganic hydrate. 
A slide according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said mixture additionally 

contains a friction and wear reducing additive in an 
amount of up to 10% by weight, preferably 2-10% by weight, 

based on the total composition. 
A slide according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said friction and wear reducing 

additive is an additive or additive mixture having 
a lamellar molecular structure, which preferably comprises 

molybden disulphide, graphite, boron nitride and/or cerium 
trifluoride. 
A slide according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said mixture additionally 

contains stabilizing additives, such as UV-stabilizers and 
antioxidants.
