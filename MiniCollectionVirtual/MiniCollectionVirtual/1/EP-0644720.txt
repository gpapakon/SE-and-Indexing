<CLAIMS>
Partially denatured whey protein product having 
a protein content of 65 - 95% by weight of protein, 

based on dry matter, a degree of denaturation of the 
protein of 55 - 80% and having a mean particle diameter 

in the range 30 - 60, in particular 40 - 50 µm, which, 
when suspended in water, shows a pH value in the range 

between 
>
 7.0 and 8.0. 
Partially denatured whey protein product 
according to Claim 1, having a particle size 

distribution in which at least 50% of the particles 
possess a particle diameter in the range 20 - 70 µm, 

less than 10% of the particles possessing particle 
diameters below 10 µm and less than 1% of the particles 

possessing particle diameters below 5 µm and less than 
10% of the particles possessing particle diameters 

above 100 µm and less than 1% of the particles 
possessing particle diameters of above 200 µm. 
Partially denatured whey protein product 
according to one of the preceding claims, having a 

protein content of 70 - 95, in particular 75 - 85, % by 
weight, based on dry matter. 
Partially denatured whey protein product 
according to one of the preceding claims, having a fat 

content of 5 - 8% by weight, based on dry matter. 
Partially denatured whey protein product 
according to one of the preceding claims, in powder 

form having a water content of at most 6% by weight. 
Partially denatured whey protein product 
according to one of the preceding claims, which, 

suspended in water, shows a pH value in the range 
between 
>
 7.0 and 7.5. 
Partially denatured whey protein product 
according to one of the preceding claims, having a 

degree of denaturation of the protein of 60 - 75%.  
 
Partially denatured whey protein according to 
Claim 4, having a lactose content of 3 - 6% by weight, 

based on dry matter. 
Process for the production of a partially 
denatured whey protein product having a protein content 

of 65 - 95, in particular 70 - 95, % by weight, based 
on dry matter, a degree of denaturation of the protein 

of 55 - 80% and having a mean particle diameter of 
30 - 60, in particular 40 - 50, µm, characterised in 

that 

a) from whey a protein-enriched, lactose-depleted 
whey retentate which is concentrated to a dry matter 

content of 25 - 35% by weight and has a protein content 
enriched to 65 - 95, in particular 70 - 95, % by 

weight, based on dry matter, and a lactose content 
depleted to 
<
 20% by weight, based on dry matter, is 
separated off, 
b) the protein-enriched concentrated whey retentate 
obtained is converted by addition of water and dilute 

alkali into a dilute whey retentate having a dry matter 
content of 10 - 20% by weight and a pH value in the 

range between 
>
 7.0 and 8.0, 
c) the dilute whey retentate obtained is preheated 
to a temperature of at least 50°C, lying below the 

coagulation point of the whey proteins, and is then 
passed through a homogeniser and is therein exposed to 

a denaturing temperature generated by simultaneous 
introduction of steam, with simultaneous 

homogenisation, during a residence time sufficient for 
the denaturation of 55 - 80% of the protein content and 
d) the homogenate obtained in process step c) is 
immediately afterwards subjected to spray-drying. 
Use of a partially denatured whey protein 
product according to Claim 1 as an emulsifying and 

viscosity-increasing additive in cold-producible food 
emulsions, in particular mayonnaises, dressings and 

meat pastes.
