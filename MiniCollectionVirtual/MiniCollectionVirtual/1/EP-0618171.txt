<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of substantially crystalline silicon 
nitride comprising heating a mixture of ammonia and a silicon halide by 

means of an electric plasma formed in a stream of non-oxidising gas is 
described. Energy is transferred to the stream of gas at a rate of at least 30 

kilowatts per mole of silicon halide per minute and at least 25 kilowatts. In 
a preferred embodiment reactant gases are caused to recirculate so that the 

recirculation ratio (RR) is greater than 2.5 where RR is defined by 

wherein 

M
n
= mass flow of gas stream through an inlet nozzle (2) 
R
= internal radius of the reactor (1) into which said 
nozzle (2) flows 
M
= mass flow at a distance 4R downstream from the 
inlet nozzle (2) 
R
n
= radius of inlet nozzle (2) 
D
n
= density of gas stream passing through the inlet 
nozzle (2) 
D
= density of gases in reactor (1) at a distance 4R 
downstream from the inlet nozzle (2). 
The degree of crystallinity of the silicon nitride prepared according to this 
method is very high and, typically greater than 85%.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of silicon nitride and in 
particular to a process for the production of crystalline silicon nitride 
by means of a vapour phase reaction between silicon tetrachloride and 
ammonia. A number of processes for the preparation of silicon nitride are 
known and the product may be either crystalline or amorphous. The 
crystalline form is preferred since this form has a higher resistance to 
hydrolysis, a higher density and is generally easier to handle. Crystalline silicon nitride can be produced by, for example, 
nitridation of elemental silicon with nitrogen or ammonia but this 
product is generally coarse and needs to be milled to produce a fine 
material suitable for forming ceramics. The milling process is likely to 
introduce contaminants such as iron or tungsten. The gas phase 
reaction of silane, SiH₄, with ammonia can also produce crystalline 
silicon nitride but this is usually contaminated with elemental silicon 
and must therefore be purified. Vapour phase reaction of a silicon 
tetrahalide with ammonia produces silicon nitride having a small 
particle size but this is normally amorphous. Further processing is 
necessary to produce crystalline silicon nitride. It is an object of the current invention to provide a process for 
the production of silicon nitride in which crystalline silicon nitride 
having a small particle size and high purity is produced in one step. According to the invention a process for the production of 
substantially crystalline silicon nitride comprises heating a mixture of 
ammonia and a silicon halide by means of an electric plasma formed in 
a stream of a non-oxidising gas and generated by the discharge of 
direct current electricity between a pair of electrodes wherein the rate 
at which energy is transferred to the stream of gas is at least 30 
kilowatts per mole of silicon halide per minute and at least 25 
kilowatts. The process produces in one step silicon nitride which is 
substantially crystalline and has a small particle size. The particle size 
can be assessed by measuring the BET specific surface area by 
nitrogen desorption and products of the process of the invention  
 
typically have a specific surface area greater than 20 metres squared 
per gram. The crystallinity of the silicon nitride can be established by, for 
example, X-ray powder diffractometry but a particularly convenient 
method is the measurement of the density of material by pycnometry. 
In this specification the term "substantially crystalline silicon
