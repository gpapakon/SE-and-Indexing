<ABSTRACT>
An ignition system for a spark-ignition engine (13) has an intermediate layer (10) between a cylinder block (12) and a cylinder head (11) which serves as a cylinder head gasket. The intermediate plate (10) carries at the inner edge of each drilled hole (14,...) at least two electrode pairs (15, 16...) to which an ignition voltage pulse generating device (26) applies a high-voltage energy through feed lines (19, 20...) laid in the intermediate layer. Diodes (27, 28...) in the feed lines (19, 20...) are used for equalizing the high-voltage energy fed to all the electrode pairs (15, 16...) of a cylinder.

layer (10) consisting of three layers (40, 41, 42) of wich the
middle layer (40) contains channels, the sheet-like

intermediate layer being able to serve on one hand as a
cylinder head gasket and on the other hand as a carrier for at

least two ignition electrode pairs for each cylinder, and in
the channels being placed electric supply-lines to the

ignition electrode pairs, the ignition electrode pairs for
each cylinder being placed regulary distributed in the

intermediate layer at the circumference of the interior edge
