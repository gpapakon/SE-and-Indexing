<ABSTRACT>
The printing machine has a number of digital printing devices, e.g. ink jet printers, supplied with machine specific image data by a raster image processor (6) receiving the image data in a machine-independent data format. Register errors for the digital printing devices are detected by optical sensors (8,9) on each side of the sheet. They detect colour intensity and send the data to an evaluating circuit (10) which provides register error signals. The corresponding error signals are supplied to an image data modification circuit (5) for register correction. The image data modification circuit receives the image data as postscript data. It modifies singles parameters of the data and outputs the modified postscript data to the raster image processor.
