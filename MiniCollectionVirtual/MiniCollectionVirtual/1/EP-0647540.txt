<ABSTRACT>
A device for operating the accelerator of an 
automobile by drivers deprived of the use of their legs 

and consisting at least of a control ring (6, 22) set 
coaxially with the steering wheel (1) and fixed to it 

with regard to rotation but with the possibility of 
axial displacement to actuate the accelerator through a 

linkage (15 - 21) fixed around the steering column (4), 
the control ring (6, 22) being joined to a collar (9) 

set coaxially around the steering column (2) and moving 
on guide stems (12) fixed to the spokes (3) of the 

steering wheel, the collar (9) acting on the linkage 
(15 - 21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device for operating the 
accelerator of an automobile by drivers deprived of the 
use of the legs. More particularly, the invention 
concerns the perfecting of this type of device. As is well known, cars for disabled persons are 
equipped in such a way that the traditional pedals are 
substituted by controls worked by hand. In particular, the most common system for 
accelerator control is that of a control ring set 
coaxially with the steering wheel, normally above the 
wheel and which operates the accelerator by axial 
movement through suitable straight-line motion. Devices of this type in current use have a 
complicated design, inasmuch as they have complex guide 
systems for the control ring and its movement towards 
and away from the steering wheel and are thus rather 
costly. Furthermore, these known systems always have a 
certain stiffness of action which can increase if the 
device is not regularly and carefully maintained and 
which makes the control ring action rather uncertain.  
 DE-A- 2.841.786 describes an 
accelerator control device having the features of the 
preamble of appended claim 1.  
 The object of the invention is to eliminate the 
above mentioned defects in providing an accelerator 
control device which is of very simple design and 
therefore economical and which is extremely easy to use 
with minimum effort, even by one finger of the hand. Another object of the invention is that of 
allowing the accelerator control device to be operated  
 
by a control ring which can be placed either above or 
below the steering wheel or even with two control rings 
placed respectively above and below the wheel, without 
this requiring any structural modification. These objectives are attained, according to the 
invention, by providing at least two guide stems, fixed 
to but running away from the spokes of the steering 
wheel and parallel to the axis of this latter and along 
which runs a collar which actuates a linkage which acts 
in its turn on the car accelerator pedal. There is also 
a control ring which can be placed either above or 
below the car steering wheel. Two control rings can be used advantageously, one 
above and the other below the steering wheel. Further features of the invention will become 
clearer from the following detailed description which 
refers to a purely exemplary form and is therefore not 
limitative and which is illustrated in the attached 
drawings:

Device for operating the accelerator of an 
automobile by drivers deprived of the use of their legs 

and consisting of a control ring (6, 22) set coaxially 
to the steering wheel (1) and fixed to it with regard to 

rotation but with the possibility of axial displacement 
to actuate the accelerator through a suitable linkage 

fixed around the steering hub (2) and steering column 
(4), said control ring (6, 22) acting on a collar (9), 

set coaxially around the steering wheel (1) hub (2), the 
translatory movement of the collar (9) actuating the 

said linkage which operates the accelerator, 
characterized in that said collar (9) is moving on guide 

stems (12) fixed to the spokes (3) of the steering 
wheel. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the said collar (9) has two supports (10) with 

respective tubular couplings (11) moving on the said 
guide stems (12). 
Device according to claims 1 or 2, characterized by 
the fact that the said control ring (6) is set above the 

steering wheel (1) and is fixed to the said collar (9) 
by means of support and connection stems (7). 
Device according to claims 1 or 2, characterized by 
the fact that the said control ring (22) is placed 

coaxially beneath the steering wheel (1) and is fixed to 
the said collar (9) by means of support plates (23). 
Device according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said control rings (6  

 
and 22) are for use in combination. 
Device according to any one of the previous claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said collar (9) is of 

a flattened type and accommodates several U seatings 
(16) of a semicircular bracket (15), attached rigidly to 

a rod (17), moving in a fixed jacket (18) and acting 
with its lower end, through a ball joint (20), on a 

further rod (21).
