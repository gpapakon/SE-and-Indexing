<ABSTRACT>
The signalling light comprises, on the one hand, a base (1) having at least one cavity, in the bottom of which a lamp is arranged and, on the other hand, at least one transparent cover (2) closing this cavity, the said base (1) and the said transparent cover (2) being held at least partially with respect to one another by mutual engagement of complementary locking means (12, 13) of two holding tabs (11a, 14) which are superposed with one another, the inner tab (11a) being the return branch of a lip (11) designed in a U-shape, the said branch (11a) being elastically flexible and having a bearing portion (15) which can be stressed elastically in bending mode, so as to allow mutual disengagement of the locking means (12, 13).

Indicator light, notably for a motor vehicle, having, on the one hand, a base (1) 
having at least one cavity (3, 4) in the bottom of which is disposed a lamp, and on 

the other hand at least one glass (2) closing this cavity, characterised in that the 
said base (1) and the said glass (2) are held at least partially with respect to one 

another by the mutual engagement of complementary locking means (12, 13) on two 
holding lugs (11a, 14), one carried by the base (1), the other by the glass (2), these 

two lugs (11a, 14) being placed one on top of the other during the positioning of the 
glass (2) on the base (1), one of the two lugs (11a, 14) then being inside the light 

with respect to the other, the inside lug (11a) being the return branch of an edge 
(11) formed in a U shape, the said branch (11a) being elastically flexible and having 

a bearing portion (15) able to be flexed elastically, so as to permit the mutual 
disengagement of the locking means (12, 13). 
Light according to Claim 1, characterised in that the U-shaped edge (11) is open 
towards the glass (2) or the base (1) which carries it, the bearing portion (15) of the 

return branch (11a) extending beyond the outer lug (14) when the glass (2) is in 
place on the base (1). 
Light according to Claim 2, characterised in that the U-shaped edge (11) is 
carried by the outer branch of a receiving groove (7) on the base (1), this groove 

being designed to receive a centring lug (5) carried by the glass (2). 
Light according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the locking 
means have at least one protrusion (12) and a complementary recess (13) carried 

respectively by each of the two holding lugs (11a, 14).  
 
Light according to Claim 3, characterised in that the retum branch (11a) carries 
the protrusion (12), the complementary recess (13) being carried by the outer lug 

(14). 
Light according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the base (1) 
and the glass (2) carry other holding lugs having complementary locking means (9, 

10) disposed on the said base (1) and the said glass (2) diametrically opposite the 
return branch (11a) and the holding lug (14) complementary thereto.
