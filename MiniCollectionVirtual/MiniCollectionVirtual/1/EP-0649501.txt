<ABSTRACT>
The microvalve of the invention is made up in layers of at least one lower part (11), a central part (12) and an upper part (13).  The sealing ring (31) (closing member), the valve plate (29) (pressure equalisation area) and the diaphragm (26) are integrated into the central part (12), this one-piece component being produced by a plastic moulding process. The valve is actuated by anelectric operating device, e.g. an electrostatic, electromagnetic or piezoelectric drive. Especially in the case of an electrostatic drive, two electrodes (17, 22) are applied in layers to the central part (12) or the lower part (11). The lower, central and upper parts are put together and permanently bonded, e.g. adhesively or by welding.

<CLAIMS>
Microvalve made of layers (11, 11a to 11l; 12,
12a to 12l; 13, 13a to 13l; 44, 6l, 61e) arranged one

above the other and connected to one another, having at
least two pressure-medium connections (14, 15; 38) for

the feed and outlet, and having a valve seat (38, 35)
connected between said connections, to which valve seat

a closure member (31) is assigned which can be deflected
by electric actuating means (17, 18, 22; 58), the closure

member being firmly connected to a membrane (26, 26a to
26l) which is integrated in one of the layers (12, 12a to

12l) and adjoins a space (34) which is acted upon by
pressure medium, and having a pressure-compensating

surface (29) which acts counter to the pressurized
membrane, characterized in that the closure member (31),

the membrane (26, 26g) and the pressure-compensating
surface (29f, 29g) are formed by a plastic moulding

process, in particular injection moulding or embossing,
in a two-layered plastic component (20f, 20g, 33f, 33g)

which, when fitted together, is a middle layer of the
microvalve and is tensioned by its outer, two-layered

circumference.
Microvalve according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the membrane (26, 26a to 26l) is formed by a cut-out

(25, 25a to 25l) on the underside (21), facing away from
the closure member (31), of the middle layer (12, 12a to

12l).
Microvalve according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the cut-out (25, 25a to 25l) is designed in the form

of a flat cylinder. 
Microvalve according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the cut-out (25, 25a to 25l) is designed in the form

of an integral axisymmetrical depression.
Microvalve according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the cut-out (25a) has the shape of

a flat truncated cone which widens towards the open side.

Microvalve according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the surface of the membrane (26, 26 a to 26l) subjected

to the pressure and the active surface acting as
a pressure-compensating surface and subjected to the

pressure are formed on the valve plate (29, 29a to 29l)
in such a way that the forces and moments are eliminated

due to the pressures acting on the membrane and the
pressure-compensating surface.
Microvalve according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the membrane (26, 26a to 26l) is

designed as an annular membrane.
Microvalve according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the closure member (31) is lifted

up from a valve seat (35) by actuating the electrical
actuating means and is brought to rest against the valve

seat again by a resilient restoring means (26, 26a to
26l; 67).
Microvalve according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the resilient restoring means is the membrane (26,

26a to 26l).

13a to 13l), of the microvalve, which is stationary when
the valve is actuated.
