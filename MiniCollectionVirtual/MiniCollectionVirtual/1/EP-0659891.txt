<ABSTRACT>
Process for manufacturing a cold-rolled thin mild steel strip for deep drawing, in which a mild steel is rolled hot in a temperature region where the said steel exhibits a ferritic structure with a rolling end temperature lower than 780 DEG C in order to form a hot-rolled strip. This hot-rolled strip is then rolled cold with a thickness reduction ratio higher than 75 % and preferably between 78 % and 85 %. The cold-rolled strip may next be subjected to a final annealing, either as a reel or continuously, and to a surface cold-working on a skin-pass rolling mill.
