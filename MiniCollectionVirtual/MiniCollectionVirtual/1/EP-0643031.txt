<ABSTRACT>
1,3-Butadiene is hydroformylated at 60 to 150 DEG C and 1 to 20 MPa in the presence of an aqueous solution which comprises at least one water-soluble rhodium compound and at least one water-soluble organic phosphine, this solution acting as the catalyst. To increase the selectivity of the reaction with regard to the formation of n-C5-aldehydes and subsequent products of the n-C5-aldehydes, a pH of 8 to 11 is maintained in the aqueous catalyst solution.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the hydroformylation of 1,3-butadiene 
at temperatures of 60 to 150°C and pressures of 1 to 

20 MPa in the presence of an aqueous solution as 
catalyst which contains at least one water-soluble 

rhodium compound and at least one water-soluble 
organic phosphine, which comprises reacting the 

butadiene at a pH in the aqueous solution of 8.0 to 
11.0. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pH in 
the aqueous solution is 8.5 to 9.5. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
pH is adjusted with the aid of a buffer mixture.

5, wherein the rhodium concentration in the aqueous 

catalyst solution is 20 to 2000 ppm by weight, 
preferably 50 to 700 ppm by weight, based on the 

aqueous catalyst solution. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
6, wherein, per mole of rhodium, 4 to 100 mol of 

phosphorus, preferably 10 to 60 mol of phosphorus, 
are present in the aqueous solutions. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
7, wherein the water-soluble phosphines used are 

triarylphosphines, trialkylphosphines, tri(alkylaryl)phosphines,  
 

alkylenediphosphines or aryldiphosphines
