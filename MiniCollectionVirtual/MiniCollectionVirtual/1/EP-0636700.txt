<ABSTRACT>
A metal-ceramic composite body is 
prepared by impregnating a porous ceramic 

preform with a molten metal. A preform (3, 15), 
a crucible (7) containing molten metal (6), and 

a channeling bundle (8) of filaments are set 
such that one end of the bundle (8) is disposed 

above the molten metal (6) in the crucible (7) 
and the other end of the bundle (8) is disposed 

in contact with the preform (3, 15). The 
crucible (7) is moved up until the bundle one 

end is immersed in the molten metal (6) whereby 
the molten metal (6) is channeled to the preform 

(3, 15) through the filaments of the bundle (8) 
for impregnating the preform (3, 15) with the 

molten metal. The crucible (7) is moved down 
until the bundle one end is withdrawn from the 

molten metal (6) whereby supply of the molten 
metal to the preform (3, 15) is interrupted. 

The invention facilitates impregnation of porous 
ceramic preforms of various shapes with molten 

metal while controlling the feed and feed rate 
of molten metal, thereby producing metal-ceramic 

composite bodies without flaw.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to methods and 
apparatus for preparing metal-ceramic 
composite bodies by impregnating porous ceramic 
preforms with molten metal. More particularly, 
it relates to such a method and apparatus which 
facilitates impregnation of porous ceramic 
preforms of various shapes with molten metal 
while controlling the feed and feed rate of 
molten metal, thereby reducing or eliminating flaws. Composite products of ceramic and metal 
are generally prepared by manufacturing porous 
ceramic preforms and impregnating the preforms 
with molten metal. One of the simplest methods for supplying 
molten metal to preforms for impregnation is by 
containing molten metal in a crucible, placing a  
 
preform above the crucible, and bringing the 
preform in contact with the molten metal whereby 
the preform is entirely impregnated with the 
molten metal by utilizing the capillary 
phenomenon associated with micropores or 
interconnected cells in the preform. This 
method suffers from several problems. 
(a) When a multiplicity of relatively 
small size preforms are impregnated at once, it 
is difficult to arrange a multiplicity of 
preforms such that all the preforms may be 
uniformly impregnated with molten metal. (b) Since preforms are impregnated with 
molten metal by utilizing the capillary 
phenomenon of the preforms, it is impossible to 
obtain composite products using preforms having 
a height exceeding a certain limit. (c) If exothermic reaction accompanies 
when preforms are impregnated with molten metal, 
many preforms can be damaged. (d) Often more metal is adhered to the 
outside, especially the bottom of a product, 
rendering post-treatment difficult. 
Another method is described in "ADVANCED 
MATERIAL AND PROCESS", 7/91, p. 25. A metal to  
 
be infiltrated (single metal or alloy) is placed 
in a suitable container, the metal is disposed 
adjacent to the top or bottom of a preform, and 
the container is heated to melt the metal 
whereby the preform is impregnated with the 
molten metal. This method also suffers from 
several problems. (e) The method is not suited for large 
scale manufacture since a container is necessary 
for each of products. (f) Where a plurality of preforms are 
disposed in a container and impregnated with 
molten metal, the preforms are at least 
partially submerged in the molten metal. The 
molten metal adheres to the outside of the 
resulting composite body. A difficult post-treatment 
is necessary to remove the metal 
deposit from the composite body after

A method for preparing a metal-ceramic 
composite body by impregnating a porous 

ceramic preform with a molten metal, comprising 
the steps of: 

   setting a porous ceramic preform (3, 15), 
a crucible (7) containing a molten metal (6), 

and a channeling bundle (8) of a plurality of 
filaments having one end and an opposite end 

such that the one end of the bundle (8) is 
disposed above the molten metal (6) in the 

crucible (7) and the opposite end of the bundle 
(8) is disposed in contact with the preform (3, 

15), 
   moving upward the crucible (7) until the 

one end of the bundle (8) is immersed in the 
molten metal (6) whereby the molten metal (6) is 

channeled to said preform (3, 15) through the 
filaments of the bundle (8) for impregnating the 

preform (3, 15) with the molten metal, and 
   moving downward the crucible (7) until the 

one end of the bundle (8) is removed from the 
molten metal (6) whereby channeling of the 

molten metal to the preform (3, 15) is 
 

interrupted.

preform (3, 15) is disposed, 
   a support (5) disposed for vertical 

motion, 
   a crucible (7) resting on said support (5) 

and containing a molten metal (6) therein, and 
   a channeling bundle (8) of a plurality of
