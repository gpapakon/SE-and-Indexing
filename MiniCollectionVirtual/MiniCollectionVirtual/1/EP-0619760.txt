<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing a catalyst particularly useful in the reaction of ethylene, oxygen and acetic acid in the vapor phase to form vinyl acetate comprises impregnating a porous support with water soluble salts of palladium and gold, fixing the palladium and gold on the support as water insoluble compounds by immersing the impregnated support in a reactive solution and tumbling the impregnated support in the reactive solution for at least 1/2 hour to begin precipitation of the insoluble compounds and completing precipitation of the insoluble compounds on the support and reducing the insoluble compounds to free palladium and gold. The catalysts prepared in this manner have been shown to provide improvement with respect to reduced selectivity to CO2 during the vinyl acetate forming reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method of producing a catalyst useful in 
the reaction of ethylene, oxygen and acetic acid in the vapor phase to form vinyl acetate. In 
particular, the present invention is directed to a novel method of forming a catalyst useful in the 
catalytic formation of vinyl acetate in which said catalyst comprises metallic palladium and gold 
deposited on a suitable porous support. It is known in the art that vinyl acetate can be produced by reacting ethylene, 
oxygen and acetic acid in the gaseous phase and in the presence of a catalyst comprising 
palladium, gold and an alkali metal acetate supported on certain carrier materials such as silica. 
Generally, such catalyst systems exhibit a high activity. Unfortunately, results utilizing such 
palladium and gold catalysts have been inconsistent. This inconsistency appears to be based 
somewhat on the distribution pattern or profile of the catalyst components which are deposited 
on and in relation to the support. For example, when use is made of the known vinyl acetate 
catalyst systems comprising a porous support with palladium and gold, the metal components 
deposited at or about the support interiors or central regions do not contribute significantly to the 
reaction mechanism, since the reactants are not readily able to diffuse into the central or inner 
regions of the porous network of the catalyst. Hence, the reaction occurs substantially only at 
the outermost or surface regions of the catalyst. The catalyst components in the interior regions 
of the support do not largely contribute to the reaction scheme, resulting in a reduction in 
catalytic efficiency per unit weight of the catalyst components. Furthermore, the use of a highly 
active catalyst at times gives rise to side reactions and, therefore, leads to a reduced selectivity 
to vinyl acetate. Various patents have been granted based on the desire to more evenly distribute 
and anchor the gold and palladium catalytic components within a narrow band on the support 
surface to provide a vinyl acetate catalyst having high yield, good selectivity and long life.  
 
Examples of such patents include U.S. Patent Nos. 4,087,622; 
4,048,096; 3,822,308; 3,775,342 and British Patent 
1,521,652. The basic method of forming the vinyl acetate catalyst 
containing palladium and gold deposited on a catalyst 
support comprises (1) impregnating the support with aqueous 
solutions of water-soluble palladium and gold compounds, 
(2) precipitating water-insoluble palladium and
