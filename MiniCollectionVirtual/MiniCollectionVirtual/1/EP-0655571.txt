<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a valve with axially sliding control device 
for fluid flow and a chamber, by which a maximum flow is made possible 

with simple structure and maintenance, without hydraulic strokes, noise 
and cavitation in the system or on the valve. The valve consists of a 

hollow cylindrical housing (9) with chamber (11) therein, axially sliding 
along the cylindrical body (1). At the middle of body (1), which has been 

carried out in axial direction with inlet/outlet openings, radially, and under 
angle relative to axial axis, two overflow openings (5,5') have been made. 

The axes of overflow openings (5,5') are placed in the same level. The inlet 
opening on body (1) with overflow openings (5) and outlet opening with 

overflow openings (5') have been mutually separated. On body (1), in bearings 
(3), in front of overflow openings (5) and between overflow openings (5) and 

(5'), sealing rings (7) are placed, over which the surface (10) of housing 
(9) slides.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of mechanical engineering, i.e. 
machine assemblies in general, and precisely, to the field of valves, 
namely, fluid flow control devices with axial sliding movement of the 
shutter, and pertains to a valve with axial sliding control device for 
fluid flow having a chamber therein. According to International Classification, the invention is classified 
as: F16K3/00. The technical problem desired to be solved is how to design the 
structure of a fluid valve which, by using a cylindrical axially movable 
housing with a chamber in it would make possible a simple and efficient 
opening/closing of fluid flow, whereby a valve of exceptionally directed 
fluid motion without cavitation, without hydraulic strokes in the system, 
i.e. noiseless, simple for maintenance with minimum parts and long lasting, 
would be obtained. The known flow valves which are most often utilized and working on a 
closing principle through coil spindle, whereby valve closing resists 
fluid pressure and is carried out by resting of rubber gasket on the 
valve seat, demonstrated many shortcomings. By such a way of valve closing 
uncontrolled tightening occurs, i.e. insufficient tightening of rubber 
gasket on valve seat, what in the first case leads to damage of gasket, 
i.e. to errosion of valve seat, due to increased velocity of fluid flow 
through such reduced cross section of the fluid flow that occurred. In those known solutions, an excessive friction also occurs between the 
coil spindle and nut through which the coil spindle is led, what most often 
leads to sliding of coil spindle. The results of such increased friction are, 
inter alia, the increase of clearance between movable elements, what creates 
vibrations of these movable elements in fluid flow, which additionally, due to 
the effect of fluid pressure, cause hydraulic strokes being transferred to 
the entire piping, whereby they make flow valves extremely noisy gadgets.  
 
These phenomena are especially known in big apartment houses, what, inter 
alia, leads to disturbance of peace in such buildings. The known flow valves working on closing principle in the direction of 
fluid motion have common shortcomings being reflected in the following: 
noisyness of such flow valves to a great extent, great piston vibrations, 
due to unsealingness and often as a result of clearance that appeared, 
uncontrolled motion occurs, i.e. undirected fluid motion, what causes 
cavitation with all negative results. A valve with axial sliding control
