<ABSTRACT>
A drive train for an electric vehicle includes a traction battery, a power drive circuit, a main contactor for connecting and disconnecting the traction battery and the power drive circuit, a voltage detector across contacts of the main contactor, and a controller for controlling the main contactor to prevent movement of its contacts to the closed position when the voltage across the contacts exceeds a predetermined threshold, to thereby protect the contacts of the contactor. The power drive circuit includes an electric traction motor and a DC-to-AC inverter with a capacitive input filter. The controller also inhibits the power drive circuit from driving the motor and thereby discharging the input capacitor if the contacts are inadvertently opened during motoring. A precharging contactor is controlled to charge the input filter capacitor prior to closing the main contactor to further protect the contacts of the main contactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
electric vehicles, and more particularly, to a drive
train for an electric vehicle including a main
contactor for connecting and disconnecting a traction
battery.Electric vehicles are receiving considerable
attention as a substitute for present gasoline-fueled
vehicles. This interest is based primarily on zero
atmospheric emissions obtainable from an all-electric
vehicle. Several states are considering stricter
emissions regulations for vehicles, and California has
adopted regulations that will go into effect and
require zero emissions for a percentage of vehicles
when operating in certain urban areas. Electric
vehicles also offer other advantages including reducing 
dependency on imported oil, since utilities in the
United States generate a large portion of their energy
demands using coal, gas, nuclear, and hydroelectric
energy sources.A typical electric vehicle has a power train
including a rechargeable traction battery powering one
or more electric motors through a suitable power drive
circuit. The traction battery typically includes a
plurality of rechargeable battery cells for powering
the vehicle. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,449,080
entitled Electric Vehicle Protection Scheme to Konrad
et al. discloses an electric vehicle including a
traction battery, a power control circuit, and a DC
drive motor. The patent also discloses a main
contactor including a pair of contacts connected in
series with the traction battery and the power control
circuit. The contactor permits the traction battery to
be connected during start-up and motoring, and
disconnected otherwise. In addition, the main
contactor also operates in combination with a circuit
fault detector to disconnect the traction battery if a
fault is detected in either of a chopper circuit or a
chopper bypass contactor.While DC motors have been used in electric
vehicles, there has been a reduction in the cost
inverters for changing DC into AC. Accordingly, AC
drive trains are now advantageously used in electric
vehicles. An AC drive train offers advantages in terms
of power-to-weight ratio and improved overall vehicle
operating efficiency. The voltage of the traction
battery is desirably relatively high, such as above 300
volts, also to provide greater efficiency.
Unfortunately, this relatively high battery voltage may
readily damage contacts of a contactor for connecting
and disconnecting the traction battery from the DC-to-AC
inverter. In general, a larger air gap is required for
contacts to interrupt
