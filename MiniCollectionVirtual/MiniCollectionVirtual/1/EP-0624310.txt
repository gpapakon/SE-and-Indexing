<CLAIMS>
A cleaning device (26), especially for a combine harvester (10), with a plurality of permeable or
impermeable crop feeding pans (40, 42, 46, 66) following one another in the direction of material

flow, and a cleaning fan (56) with a plurality of outlets (58, 64) for feeding air into the gaps
between a plurality of crop feeding pans (40, 42, 46, 66), characterized in that the first outlet

(58) comprises one channel (60) which feeds a first airstream (52) between first and second crop
feeding pans (40, 42) and another channel (62) which passes a second airstream (54) between the

second and a third crop feeding pan (42 and 46), while the second outlet (64) passes a third
airstream (72) under a fourth crop feeding pan (66).
A cleaning device according to claim 1, characterized in that the discharge directions of the two
channels (60, 62) are parallel to one another.
A cleaning device according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
cleaning fan (56) sucks in the air rally and discharges it tangentially.
A combine harvester (10) with a cleaning device (26) according to one or more of the preceding
claims.

66), of which a first (40) is formed by a pre-conditioning pan which is serrated or provided with

augers, a second (42) is formed by a step pan, a third (46) by a conditioning pan and a fourth (66)
by a chaff sieve.
A combine harvester according to claim 5, characterized in that the fourth crop feeding pan (66)
comprises louvres (76) extending transverse to the feed direction, wherein the spacing between a

front louvre (76) and a frame part (78) receiving the same, or a further louvre, is substantially
twice as large as the spacing between following louvres.
