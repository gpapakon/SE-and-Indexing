<ABSTRACT>
Two substrates (202) are simultaneously produced by an
injection molding apparatus (12), and the injection-molded

substrates (202) are alternately arranged and cooled by a
cooling apparatus (14). The cooling apparatus (14) has a

feed screw mechanism (250) for feeding the alternately
arranged substrates (202) in one direction while cooling air

is being applied to the substrates (202). An information
recording medium which includes a substrate (202) is

manufactured on a production line having a single injection
molding apparatus (12) for simultaneously injection-molding

two substrates (202) and four dye solution coating machines
(38) for forming a dye recording layer (204) for recording

information on each of the substrates (202).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing an information recording medium having a substrate manufactured by injection molding.Optical information recording mediums (optical disks) capable of recording information once with a laser beam include a write-once CD (so-called CD-R) and a DVD-R. These optical information recording mediums are advantageous in that they allow a smaller quantity of CDs to be supplied quickly to the market at a reasonable price than conventional CDs (compact disks), and there are growing demands for such optical information recording mediums in view of the recent widespread use of personal computers.Typically, a CD-R-type information recording medium comprises a disk-shaped transparent substrate having a thickness of about 1.2 mm, a recording layer of an organic dye deposited on the substrate, a light reflecting layer of metal such as gold disposed on the recording layer, and a protective layer of resin disposed on the light reflecting layer. For details, see Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 6-150371, for example.A DVD-R-type information recording medium comprises two disk-shaped transparent substrates each having a thickness of about 0.6 mm which are bonded to each other with their information recording surfaces facing each other. The DVD-R-type information recording medium can record a greater amount of information.The substrates of these optical disks are generally made of polycarbonate or acrylic resin by injection molding or injection compression molding for better productivity.Specifically, a stamper is disposed in a cavity defined between a fixed mold and a movable mold of a closed mold assembly of an injection molding machine, and a molten resin is injected into the cavity to produce a substrate which has tracking grooves and recesses and protrusions representing information such as address signals transferred to its surface from the stamper.Usually, one or two substrates are manufactured in one injection molding cycle. Substrates which have been molded are removed from the mold and cooled. Specifically, the substrates are cooled by either being placed flatwise on respective rotary tables which have chucks for holding the substrates at central holes thereof, or being arranged vertically in a magazine.For manufacturing CD-R-type information recording mediums, two substrates are simultaneously molded, and the molded substrates are cooled on independent lines. For manufacturing DVD-R-type information recording mediums, one of the two substrates to
