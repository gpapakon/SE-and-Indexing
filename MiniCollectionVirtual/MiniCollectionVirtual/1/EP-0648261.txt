A RETROVIRALVECTOR CAPABLE OFTRANSDUCING THE ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE-1 GENE AND USES OF SAID VECTORThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 08/041,722, filed on April l, 1993, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.Throughout this application various publications are referenced by the names of the authors and the year of the publication within parentheses. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.BACKGROUND OP INVENTIONRecent advances in autologous bone marrow transplant strategies indicate that normal hematopoiesis can be promptly restored in patients treated with myelotoxic agents (drugs or radiation) by re-injection of autologous peripheral blood (CD34+) "stem cells" (Gianni, et al., Lancet 2:580, 1989). In addition, it has very recently been reported that CD34+ cells can be transduced in vitro at high efficiency with retroviral vectors expressing specific genes (Bregni, et al., Blood 80:1418, 1992) . These technology open the way to approaches in which the in vitro transduction of specific genes into autologous CD34+ cells followed by reinoculation into patients can be used to transduce 

genes of therapeutic significance. This gene therapy approach includes the reconstitution of drug-resistant hematopoietic cells allowing for subsequent treatment with higher dose myelotoxic chemotherapy in cancer patients.
