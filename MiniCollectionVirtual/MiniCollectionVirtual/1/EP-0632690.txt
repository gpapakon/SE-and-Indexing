<ABSTRACT>
The dispensing and metering device has a container (1) connected by a funnel-shaped region (3) to a tube (4) defining a lower end (5). A valve (6) is journalled by a pivot (9) to a clamp (10) connected to the lower end (5). A biasing spring maintains the valve (6) in a normally closed position on the lower end (5). Arms (7, 8), connected to the valve (6), can be placed in contact with the ground to rotate the valve (6) about the pivot (9) against the action of the biasing spring to open the lower end (5) and dispense product (2) from the container (1) in a localized area.

<DESCRIPTION>
PORTABLE DEVICE FOR DISPENSING AND METERING GRANULAR OR POWDERY PRODUCTSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a portable device for dispensing and metering granular or powdery products, particularly herbicides or fertilizers.Background ArtThe invention is used in the highly localized weeding or fertilizing operations often required in hobby and professional gardening, in agriculture and in any case in operations that entail the highly localized placement, on a flat surface such as for example a lawn or flower-bed, of small doses of dry and freely flowing granular and powdery products.In particular, weeds, including invasive ones, very often spread in lawns and must be eliminated, otherwise they quickly spread and visibly damage the lawn.According to a known method, these weeds are removed with blade-fitted tools, but it is obvious that this is a tiring and very slow operation.In some cases it is possible to use selective herbicides, but since these substances are not applied in a localized manner they lead to an expensive and unhealthy application.Disclosure of the InventionThe aim of the present invention is to provide an apparatus that can act in a localized, fast and trouble-free manner.An object is to provide a tool for metering the product used from a minimum amount up to an amount required. 

 Another object is to provide an apparatus which is convenient in use and has low costs.With the above aim and objects in view, there is provided a portable device for dispensing and metering granular or powdery products, characterized in that it comprises a container for a granular product which is associated with a discharge tube having, at its lower end, a valve which is kept closed by an elastic means and has a lever for opening it by interaction with the ground. Brief description of the drawings Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, given only by way of non- limitative example and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein: figure 1 is a view of the dispensing and metering device in a carrying condition; figure 2 is a view of the dispensing and metering device of figure 1 during discharge of the product; figure 3 is a detail view of the valve located at the base of the dispensing and metering device of figure 1; figure 4 is a second view of the valve of figure 3; figure 5 is an exploded view of the components of the valve; figures 6 and 7 are views of another embodiment of the

CLAIMS
1. Portable device for dispensing and metering granular or powdery products, characterized in that it comprises a container for a granular product which is associated with a discharge tube that has, at its lower end, a valve which is kept closed by an elastic means and has a lever for opening it by interaction with the ground. 2. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said container for granular product is substantially a cylindrical body that tapers like a funnel in its lower part and blends with the discharge tube. 3. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said valve is composed of two mutually rigidly coupled arms which are arranged substantially at 90 , the first arm being flat and mating with the open end of said tube, the second arm being conveniently longer and being suitable to interfere with the ground, said lever being associated, by means of a pivot, with a means for clamping on the end of the tube. 4. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said valve has, in its pivoting point, a spring which by acting between the clamping means and said levers keeps the nozzle, constituted by the end of the tube, normally closed. 5. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the end of said tube is cut along a plane which is not at right angles to the geometric axis of the tube but is inclined so as to facilitate the discharge of the granular material when the valve is open. 6. Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 


in an alternative solution, said lever-like valve is associated with said tube by means of an elastic lamina which acts both as return and closure spring and as a deformable element that allows to open said valve.
