<ABSTRACT>
A colour display device (10) incorporates three light sources (12) supplying red, green and blue light respectively. A spatial light modulator (20) is positioned to provide time varying selective blocking of light from the sources (12) under television signal control. Light passes from the sources (12) to a condenser lens (16), then through a liquid crystal display element (22) and a projection lens (18) before reaching a screen (30). The display element (22) is also under television signal control. Signals supplied to the display element (22) provide for successive sets of three frames to be displayed, each set incorporating frame information to be displayed as red, green and blue and combinable to form a coloured frame. When the element (22) displays a frame corresponding to one of the three colours red, green and blue, the modulator (20) transmits that colour and blocks the others. The screen (30) receives a colour image in which red, green and blue are displayed successively for each frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a colour display device.Colour display devices such as colour television and colour projection apparatus
are well known. One variety of colour television involves a thermionic vacuum
tube containing a phosphor pixel screen. The screen has three phosphor dots in
respective primary colours at each pixel. Three electron guns are employed, each
addressing a respective primary colour dot at each pixel. This arrangement is
complex, bulky and expensive. Colour projection apparatus typically employs a
coloured slide projected on to a screen with illumination by a white light source.
This does not lend itself to the projection of television signals, since such slides
are only suitable for still images.Liquid crystal displays are known for the production of television pictures, but there
is difficulty in producing sufficiently large displays of the required quality. To obtain
a large area picture, it is known to employ three liquid crystal displays each
illuminated by a respective primary colour. Light from each display is projected on
to a screen at which the primary colours are superimposed to yield a colour image.
This is optically complex, as it requires three optical sections with accurate mutual
alignment.Colour display systems incorporating liquid crystal light valves or spatial light
modulators are also known. International Patent Application PCT/US88/00142
published as WO-A-88/06391 relates to one such system. It includes a white light
source and an array of dichroic mirrors to define separate red, green and blue light
beams. The beams pass through respective polarizers referred to as optical
switches; the latter are arranged to provide either polarization rotation or no such
rotation according to an electrical signal input effecting an "off" or "on" state. The
beams are subsequently recombined to form a single beam and pass to a
polarization analyser. The analyser reflects light with rotated polarization to a light
valve and transmits light having unchanged 
polarization. The red, green and blue beams undergo rotation of polarization
successively, so that at any one time the light valve receives light of one of the
three colours. A cathode ray tube illuminates the light valve to form an image
therein, and the image reflects the incident red, green or blue light to a projection
screen or the like. This system is undesirably complex. It requires five
polarization selective devices and three colour selective (dichroic) mirrors.European Patent Application EP-A-0301 715 relates to a
