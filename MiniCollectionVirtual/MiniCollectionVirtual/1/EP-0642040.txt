<ABSTRACT>
In order to manufacture lightweight mirror structures or other reflecting assemblies, there are applied, to a porous carbon supporting framework (CFC or CMC) having the dimensions of the assembly to be manufactured, shaped parts made of silicon and having an adequate wall thickness, at temperatures between 1300 DEG C and 1600 DEG C in vacuo or in a protective gas (inert gas) atmosphere, which directly results in the formation of mirror structures or reflectors. It is possible to operate at temperatures of 300-600 DEG C if the shaped parts made of silicon, especially wafers, are bonded to the supporting framework via a zone of a melt eutectic, introducing a non-ferrous metal, especially gold. Finally the surfaces are coated.

Method of manufacturing a reflector for reflecting
electromagnetic waves, the said method comprising the

following steps:

a) the manufacture of a porous carrier body from
carbon fibre-reinforced or silicon carbide fibre-reinforced

composite;
b) the covering of the carrier body with silicon in
the form of powder or silicon mouldings;
c) the infiltration of the carrier body with silicon
in a protective gas atmosphere or in a vacuum, so

that the silicon becomes liquid and the porous
material is saturated with the liquid silicon and

a silicon carbide coating is generated at the
boundary faces between the porous material and

the liquid silicon and the covering of silicon is
connected to the infiltrated carrier body by

melting-on or sintering-on;
d) the cooling of the carrier body with the covering
of silicon located thereon, and the smoothing of

the said covering; and
e) the application of a reflection coating made of
silicon, carbon, silicon carbide, silicon oxide,

silicon nitride, gold, silver, nickel, copper or
alloys of the aforesaid metals, to the smoothed

covering.
Method according to claim 1,

wherein, in step

e), a reflection coating made of silicon, carbon,
silicon carbide, silicon dioxide, silicon

nitride, gold, silver, nickel, copper or alloys
of the aforesaid metals is applied by physical

vapour deposition (PVD) in a temperature range of
20°C to 900°C.
Method according to claim 1,

wherein, in step

e), a reflection coating made of gold, silver,
nickel, copper or alloys of the aforesaid metals

is applied by electrolysis at between 20°C and
200°C.
Method according to claim 1,

wherein, in step

e), a reflection coating made of silicon, silicon
carbide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, nickel

or alloys of the aforesaid metals is applied by
thermal flame spraying or plasma spraying.
Method according to claim 1,

wherein, in step

e), a reflection coating made of silicon, carbon,
silicon carbide, silicon dioxide, silicon

nitride, nickel or alloys of the aforesaid metals
is applied by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) in

a temperature range from 600°C to 2000°C and in a
vacuum or a protective gas atmosphere.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that

a coating made of carbon is applied before the
application of the reflection coating.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that

recesses are incorporated in the porous carrier body
before the introduction of silicon.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that,

before the covering of the carrier body with silicon,
the silicon and/or the carrier surface is coated with 

an NF metal, preferably gold, which forms a molten
eutectic with silicon, and the said molten eutectic is

generated by heat treatment at 300°C to 600°C.
Method according to one of claim 1 to 8,
characterised in that

the carrier body is exposed, at temperatures between
1600°C and 2300°C, to an atmosphere containing silicon

vapour, and is infiltrated with silicon.
