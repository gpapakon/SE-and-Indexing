<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of determining in a mobile telephone network when a mobile can be considered to be switched-off, so as to obviate the need of paging the location of the mobile concerned upon the occurrence of a terminating call thereto. The time of making each radio contact with the mobile is recorded, and upon the occurrence of a terminating call, the difference between the time of this occurrence and the recorded time is calculated. The mobile is marked as being switched-off when this difference exceeds a given length of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A Method and a System for Activity Supervision in a Mobile Telephone NetworkField of the inventionThe present invention generally relates to cellular mobile radio systems based upon the so called GSM standard (GSM - Global System for Mobile communication) , and more particularly to a method and to a system for determining in a mobile telephone network when a mobile can be considered to be switched-off so as to obviate the need to page the mobile concerned upon occurrence of a terminating call.Background of the invention A GSM network basically comprises at least one base station system BSS including a base station controller BSC and base station tranceivers BTS. The GSM network furthermore includes a mobile services switching centre MSC, a home location register HLR and a visitors location register VLR. Each subscribing mobile station MS belongs to a HLR in a home network, wherein permanent subscriber data is stored.When a mobile station is registered in a MSC/VLR as a new visitor, that mobile station's HLR sends a copy of the relevant subscriber data to MSC/VLR. Present-day mobile telephony systems have a finite available radio-path capacity, and consequently different methods are employed in an attempt to utilize available radio resources to a maximum.When signalling to and from mobiles, it is necessary to achieve uniform distribution between signalling from the network to the mobile and between signalling from the mobile to the network, in order to better utilize those radio resources that are available.In order to make the area within which a called sub- scriber shall be paged as small as possible when connecting a call to a mobile subscriber, the radio network is divided into location areas which consist of one or more cells. This results primarily in a reduction of the load on the radio path in a direction from network to mobile. Thus, only the radio network is loaded in that location area in which the 

paged mobile is expected to be located when paging, this being the procedure followed by the network when paging a called mobile. Consequently, procedures are found in which the mobiles are required to inform the network of a move from one location area to another and which oblige the mobiles to carry out this procedure. These procedures are called locaÂ¬ tion updating procedures in the GSM-system.It is not sufficient to know in which location area a given mobile is located, since the mobile may have switched- off its receiving power and cannot therefore be reached by paging. It is thus desirable

 Claims
1. A method of determining in a mobile telephone network when a mobile station can be considered to be switched-off so as to obviate the need to page the mobile station concerned upon the occurrence of a terminating call thereto, comprising the steps of registering a time stamp Tl at which each radio contact is made with a mobile, registering upon occurrence of a terminating call to a mobile station a time of occurence T2, calculating a time difference T3 between said time stamp Tl and said time of occurrence T2, marking the called mobile station as being switched-off if said time difference T3 exceeds a predetermined length of time T4.
2. A method according to claim 1, comprising the step of first checking, at occurrence of a terminating call to a mobile station, whether said station has allready been marked as being switched off, and stopping the call set up attempt if this is the case.
3. In a GSM mobile telephone network including mobile switching centers, a system for determining when a mobile station can be considered to be switched-off, so as to obviate the need of paging the mobile station upon the occurrence of a terminating call thereto, said system comprising in said mobile switching centers means for registering a time stamp Tl at which each radio contact is made with a mobile, means for registering upon occurrence of a terminating call to a mobile station a time of occurence T2, means for calculating a time difference T3 between said time stamp Tl and said time of occurrence T2 , means for marking the called mobile station as being switched-off if said time difference T3 exceeds a predetermined length of time T4.
4. A system according to claim 3, comprising means for first checking, at occurrence of a terminating call to a mobile station, whether said station has allready been marked 


as being switched off, and stopping the call set up attempt if this is the case.
