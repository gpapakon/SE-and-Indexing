<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bipolar high-frequency surgical instrument comprising a rigid pipe shaft (11) and a working tip (12) which preferably has essentially the same cross-section as the adjoining part of the pipe shaft (11) and on which there are centrally arranged at least one working electrode that can be exposed to a high-frequency voltage, for example a cutting electrode (13, 13'') or coagulation electrode (13'), and a neutral electrode (14) which preferably has a much larger surface area. The working tip (12) is connected in articulated or bendable fashion to the rigid pipe shaft (11) near the distal end of the instrument, such that it can be pivoted from a position axially aligned with the pipe shaft (11) into a position angled-off relative to the pipe shaft (11), and that there are means (17, 18, 19) for pivoting and returning the working tip (12).
