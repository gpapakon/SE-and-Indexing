<ABSTRACT>
Leather products that are well lubricated, impermeable and water-repellent are produced by impregnating tanned hides or skins under alkaline conditions with an aqueous emulsion of a mixture of alkyl or alkenyl carboxylic acids or anhydrides containing at least 16 carbon atoms, and in particular polyisobutenyl succinic acid or its anhydride containing at least 30 carbon atoms, and fatty acids in specified proportions followed by retaining with basic solutions or with the emulsion which is also covered may additionally contain fatty acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
In our European Patent Application 89300038.0 (EP-A-0 324 536) we describe 
well lubricated leather which may also be impermeable, and 
water-repellent, in addition the leather can have improved 
fullness. That Application also describes a process for 
producing such leather which does not significantly change 
the normal tanning cycle, it also relates to new emulsions 
which may be used in this process. Products and processes for waterproofing leather have been 
described for example fluorinated compounds, chromium 
stearate esters and silicone derivatives have been proposed 
to impart impermeability to water. However, only 
exceptionally do such substances have the property of 
inducing good lubrication of the leather fibre and on no 
account have they been found to simultaneously impart 
impermeability, water-repellence and lubrication. 
Lubrication apart, impermeable leather is not always 
water-repellent and vice versa, as impermeability is 
associated with molecular transformation of the 
water-absorbing loci into water-repellent loci whilst 
water-repellence is only due to actual depositing 
(impregnation) of a water repelling agent between the 
fibres of the skin, without any reaction. Impermeable leather, lacking water-repellent properties, 
will become considerably wet on the surface when in contact 
with water before inhibiting penetration of the water. 
Hitherto, water-repellent properties have been obtained by 
a hydrophobic coating however, the movement of the leather 
during use, will displace this coating, with consequent 
loss of the water-repellent properties.  
 For this reason, water-repellent leathers do not respond 
well to the I.U.P. 10 dynamic impermeability test. 
Moreover, it is well known that leathers can lose their 
impermeability or water repellent properties or lubrication 
when washed with surfactants or solvents. In the tanning process leather is generally treated with a 
strong acid such as sulphuric acid and then with a metal 
tanning agent generally based on chromium or aluminium 
compounds. This tends to result in the leather retaining a 
positive charge particularly in the bulk of the leather 
even if the surface is subsequently neutralised. Previous 
proposals have been made, for Example in United States 
Patents 3770372 and 3784400, that leather may be lubricated 
with emulsions of alkyl or alkenyl succinic acids or 
anhydrides which may also contribute to the waterproof 
properties of the leather. These processes would result in 
a hydrophobic product with no

<CLAIMS>
A process comprising treating tanned hides or skins 
with an aqueous emulsion of a mixture of (a) an alkyl 

or alkenyl carboxylic acid or anhydride or derivative 
thereof containing at least 25 carbon atoms in the 

alkyl or alkenyl group and (b) from greater than 23.08% up to 60% by 
weight of fatty acids based on the weight of the 

mixture of (a) and (b) in which the treatment is 
carried out at a pH from 9 to 10 and subsequently 

acidifying the treaded hides or skins, wherein the fatty acid is selected from stearic, aleic and palmitic acids or is a mixture of C6 to C19 mono and dicarboxylic acids. 
A process according to claim 1 in which the aqueous 
emulsion comprises water, the carboxylic acid, 

anhydride or derivative thereof, the fatty acids and an 
emulsifier. 
A process according to either claim 1 or claim 2 in which 
the treated hides or skins is retanned with metal salts 

to fix free carboxylic acid groups or derivative groups used in the treatment as 
well as dyes and organic retanning agents.  

 
A process according to claim 3 in which the treated 
hides or skins is finally rotanned with chromium or 

aluminium salts. 
A process according to claims 3 or 4 in which 
subsequent to retanning the retanned hides or skins is 

treated with an agent to destroy the hydrogen bonding 
between the carboxylic acid or anhydride or any 

derivative thereof and the leather. 
A process according to claim 5 in which the agent is 
methylene chloride. 
Treated hides or skins impregnated with a mixture 
according to any one of claims 1 to 6. 
The use in the treatment of tanned hides or skins at a 
pH from 9 to 10 of an emulsion of a mixture according 

any one of claims 1 to 6.
