<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal transmitting method and apparatus, and more
particularly, to a signal transmitting method and apparatus by which an orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) method is improved.As a transmission rate is increased when data is transmitted through a wire or wireless
channel, multipath fading or intersymbol interference (ISI) is increased, so that reliable
data transmission cannot be expected. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) and discrete multitone (DMT) are resistant to the multipath fading and ISI and
their band efficiencies are high, so that they are adopted in the signal transmitting method
of a digital audio broadcast (DAB) and digital television (TV) in Europe, and they are
used for an asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) and a universal asymmetric digital
subscriber line (UADSL) in U. S. A.FIG. 1 shows a typical OFDM signal transmitting procedure. A series of input data bits
bn is encoded to sub-symbols Xn by an encoder 102. A series of Xn is convened to N-sized
vectors or blocks by a serial-to-parallel converter 104. A pilot tone adder 105 adds
M pilot tones Pi (i = 1, ... , M) to Xn to achieve channel estimation in a receiving side.
The output of the pilot tone adder 105 is N-point inverse fast Fourier transformed by an
N-point inverse fast Fourier transformer (N-IFFT) 106, to N time domain signal xk.
Here, n indicates a frequency domain index, and k indicates a time domain index.
A parallel-to-serial convener 108 transforms the vectors or blocks composed of N elements
to a series of time domain signals xk. A cyclic prefix adder 110 copies the last G signals
from the N signals and attaches them to the front of the N signals. The G signals are
referred to as cyclic prefix. (N+G) signal samples compose an OFDM symbol block in a
time domain. The OFDM symbol block is consecutively converted to analog signals through
a digital-to-analog converter 112, and the converted analog signals are output after an
intermediate frequency (I/F) process and a radio frequency (R/F) process. The above-described
procedure is typical for signal transmission in an OFDM system. Here, the
position of the encoder 102 may be exchanged with the position of the serial-to-parallel
converter 104.FIG. 2 shows a typical procedure for receiving OFDM signals. The received analog signals
are converted to a base band signal r(t) through an R/F process and an I/F process, and the
analog signals are sampled through an analog-to-digital converter 202 to convert the
