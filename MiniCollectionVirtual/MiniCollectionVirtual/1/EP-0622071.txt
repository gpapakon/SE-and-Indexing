<ABSTRACT>
A whitening cosmetic preparation containing 
angiogenin as an effective component is disclosed. Angiogenin 

used in the present invention may be derived from milk, 
especially bovine milk. The whitening cosmetic preparation 

contains at least 0.001% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 
20% by weight angiogenin based on the total amount of said 

preparation. A method for whitening skin comprising 
administration of angiogenin to skin is also disclosed. The 

whitening cosmetic preparation inhibits melanin production and 
prevents the developments of blotches and freckles of skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
the use of angiogenin for the manufacture of
a whitening
medical preparation. Angiogenin is known to be an
angiogenesis factor.Angiogenin is known as a material involved in the
proliferation of human tumor and the like. The material is
one of angiogenesis factors. Human angiogenin was isolated
from human tumor cells by Fett et al. (J.W.Fett et al.,
Biochem., vol.24, 5480-5486,1985). Human angiogenin is known
to be a protein of a molecular weight of 14,400. Subsequently the
complete amino acid sequence of angiogenin has been determined
by Strydom et al. (D.J.Strydom et al., Biochem., vol.24, 5486-5494,1985).Angiogenin exists in blood and even in milk. Bond et
al. have isolated bovine angiogenin from bovine blood
(M.D.Bond et al., Biochem. vol. 27, 6282-6287,1988). Maes et
al. have isolated angiogenin from bovine milk (P.Maes et al.,
FEBS LETTERS vol.241, 41-45,1988) and have determined the
amino acid sequence of the angiogenin.JP-A-2-296000 describes a method for recovering angiogenin
by adsorbing angiogenin from milk by cation exchange
chromatography, and eluating it with an aqueous solution of an 
alkaline metal salt of a weak organic acid and recovering the
eluate by cation exchange chromatography again and gel
permeation chromatography. Angiogenin thus obtained has been
researched for its physiological activities.The most important physiological activity of
angiogenin is angiogenic activity as described above. Owing to
this function, usages of angiogenin for the treatment of
injuries, ulcers, organ implantation, circulatory hypofunction
have been suggested. However, another functions other than
such function have not been known. JP-A-4-210618
describes an example of the use of
angiogenin as a hair growth agent. EP-A-0 334 776 discloses a cosmetic or pharmaceutical
composition, to be used on the skin, which composition
contains the serum of colostrum which contains angiogenin as
the active principle. On the other hand, blotches and freckles and the
like result from melanin production in tissues due to
suntan and the like. It is known that melanin may be formed by
oxidizing tyrosine catalytically by tyrosinase first and then
carrying out several stages of reactions. It has been proved
that the development of blotches and freckles may be
controlled by inhibiting tyrosinase. Until now the existence
of such inhibitory effects in albutin, kojic acid and
hydrogenated casein have been confirmed and thus they have
been used as skin whitening agents. A variety of materials
