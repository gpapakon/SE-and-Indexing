<ABSTRACT>
A call distribution system is provided for distributing calls and information relating to the calls to different stations serviced by telephones and computers. The call distribution system comprises one or more telephone lines (52, 300), with or without a PBX (50) or an ACD, a first telephony interface device (62, 308) connected to a computer and to the telephone lines (52, 300), a second telephony interface device (76, 306) connected to the telephone lines (52, 300), a call control process (116, 350) that controls the telephony functions on the first telephony interface device (62, 308), a telephony interface process (254, 354) that controls the telephony functions on the second telephony interface device (76, 306), and an interprocess message dispatch system (112, 352) that is used to send messages between the call control process (116, 350) and the telephony interface process (254, 354).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel call
distribution system that can be implemented in any
telephonic environment with all existing equipment.
In one aspect, it relates to a system for integrating
telecommunications systems and information systems to
provide an improved system for simultaneously
distributing calls and information.Private branch exchanges (PBXs) and other
call switching devices receive incoming telephone
calls to an establishment and distribute the calls to
available agents at the establishment. However,
sophisticated call distribution involving facilities
such as multiple caller queues for servicing multiple
categories of callers is only available at the cost of
acquiring large amounts of expensive and specialized
equipment. For example, automatic call distributors
can handle large numbers of incoming and outgoing
calls simultaneously, and they can manage calls by
holding them in queues until an agent is available to
receive the call. These systems are expensive to
install and expensive to modify.Many of the users of call switching systems
use them to distribute calls to banks of agents who
respond to callers' requests with the help of 
application programs developed at the user's
establishment. These application programs typically
operate on host computers and are used to organize and
process large databases of information related to the
business, customers and/or market of the user. The
functions provided by these application programs
include responding to agent inquiries to send data in
a particular format or responding to requests for
information on particular subjects or items. Users
also can use application programs to tailor-make the
agent's interface with the application program for
displaying the information necessary for the agent to
handle the calls he or she receives. Users also use
the application programs for performing statistical
and other analyses on the data that are uniquely
suited for the user's business.In the past, it was difficult to integrate a
telephone call with the data that related to the
purpose of the call or the identity or business of the
caller. Agents using application programs were forced
to request information from a host computer running
the application program only after receiving the
telephone call from the PBX and obtaining key
information from the caller. This procedure was time-consuming,
and prone to errors. Furthermore, if the
agent transferred the call, the data obtained from the
host computer could not be transferred with the call
and was

<CLAIMS>
A call distribution system, comprising:

a plurality of telephony interface devices (62,308), each having a telephony
connection with a telephone line (52,300);
a plurality of computers (60,316), each having a data connection to a telephony
interface device characterized by;
a data network (58) connecting said computers;
each of said computers (60, 316) running a control process (116,350) that
controls said telephony interface device to perform telephony functions and sending

messages to said remaining computers over said data network;
wherein each control process (116, 350) is capable of controlling said telephony
interface device (62, 308) to transfer a telephone call to an available telephony interface

device while said control process transfers data associated with said telephone call to
another control process (116, 350) and wherein said data is sent in messages sent over

said data network (58);
wherein each control process maintains a table indicating the state of all
telephony interface devices, including which 
telephony interface devices are available
to receive a transferred call and which are not, and wherein said control process builds

and maintains said table by receiving messages over said data network.
The call distribution system of claim 1, wherein said table indicating the state 
of telephony interface devices comprises an entry comprising the identification of an

agent's computer.
The call distribution system of claim 2, wherein said identification of an agent's
computer comprises a network address.
The call distribution system of claim 1, wherein said control processes update
an entry in said table by querying an agent station for data describing the state of said

agent station's telephony interface device.
A call distribution system, comprising:

a plurality of telephony interface devices, each having a telephony connection
with a telephone line (52, 300) characterized by;
a plurality of control processes (116, 350) that control said telephony interface
devices to perform telephony functions and send messages to each other over an

interprocess message dispatch system (112, 352);
wherein each control process (116, 350) is capable of controlling at least one of
said telephony interface devices (62, 308) to transfer a telephone call to an available

telephony interface while said control process transfers data associated with said
telephone call to another control process (116, 350) and wherein data is sent in

messages sent over said interprocess message dispatch system (112, 352); and 
wherein said control process maintains or has access to information indicating
the state of all control processes (116, 350), and wherein said control process maintains

or has access to said information by sending and receiving messages over said
interprocess message dispatch system (112, 352).
The call distribution system of claim 5, wherein said information indicating the
state of all telephony interface devices comprises an entry comprising the identification

of an agent's control process.
The call distribution system of claim 6, wherein said identification of an agent's
control process comprises a network address.
The call distribution system of claim 5, wherein said information comprises
entries and wherein said control processes update an entry by querying an agent station

for data describing the state of said agent station's telephony interface device.
