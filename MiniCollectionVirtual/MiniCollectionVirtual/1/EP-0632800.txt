<ABSTRACT>
An aromatic diamino-diol (such as 4,6-diaminoresorcinol) is made by reducing an aromatic halo-dinitro-diol (such as 2-halo-4,6-dinitroresorcinol) with molecular hydrogen in an aqueous mixture containing a noble metal hydrogenation catalyst, an aqueous solvent and 2 moles of hydrogen halide per mole of aromatic halo-dinitro-diol, plus an additional quantity sufficient to provide a 0.75 to 4 molar solution of the hydrogen halide.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR REDUCING AROMATIC HALO-DINITRO-DIOLS IN THE PRESENCE OF HYDROGEN HALIDEThis invention relates to the art of synthesizing diaminobenzenediols and related compounds.Metal catalyzed hydrogenation of halo-dinitro-dihydroxy benzenes such as 2-haio-4,6-dinitroresorcinol is known to be useful for synthesizing diaminobenzenediols, such as 4,6-diaminoresorcinol. See Lysenko, High Purity Process for the Preparation of 4,6-Diamino- -1 ,3-benzenediol, U.S. Patent 4,755,244 (August 23, 1988). During hydrogenation, the nitro groups are converted to amine groups, and the halogen is removed from the aromatic ring as hydrogen halide.At high pH, the selectivity of the reaction is diminished. The patentof Liu, U.S. Patent 5,001 ,265 (March 19, 1991 ) shows that the reduction can be carried out in an aqueous solution that contains an acid that is weaker than a hydrogen halide but is strong enough to protonate and protect the aminophenol. That process is advantageous because it uses an aqueous solvent, but it has other drawbacks. It produces an aqueous waste stream that contains both hydrogen halide ions (from the halogen that is removed during hydrogenation) and other ions (such as phosphate ions) from the protective acid. Such mixed waste streams are more difficult to purify or recycle than streams containing a single ion.What is needed is a method to reduce the halo-dinitro-benzenediol compound to an aromatic diamino-diol rapidly with high selectivity, without putting a mixture of different ions into the waste stream.The present invention is a process for synthesizing an aromatic diamino-diol compound containing the step of contacting an aromatic halo-dinitro-diol comDOund with an excess of hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal hydrogenation catalyst whereby an aromatic diamino-diol compound is formed, characterized in that the reaction takes place in the presence of: 

 (1) an aαueous soivent; and(2) 2 to 6 moles of hydrogen halide per mole of aromatic haio-dinitro-diol plus an aαditional amount sufficient to provide a 0.75 to 4 molar solution of hydrogen halide in the aαueous soivent.The process of the Dresent invention produces aromatic diamino-diol relatively quickly with good selectivity with an aqueous waste stream that contains only hydrogen halide ions. The compounds that are made are useful as intermediates in the synthesis of dyes and pharmaceuticals; as photographic developers, as described in 2 Encyclopedia Chem. Tech. - 3rd Ed., Aminophenols, 422-40 (J. Wiley & Sons 1978); and as co-monomers
