<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement (10) for a flashing light system (11) of a train set consisting of a traction vehicle and a trailer which can be connected electrically to the traction vehicle comprises a flasher unit (17) which is designed to operate all the flashing lights (12, 13, 14) of the train set provided in each direction of travel at its pulse output (21). The flasher unit (17) comprises control inputs (E1, E2; 26, 27) by means of which the number of monitored flashing lights of the traction vehicle which are provided in each direction can be selected. The flasher unit (17) also drives a signalling light (23) for displaying the flasher pulse, and, when a trailer is not electrically connected, the flasher unit (17) indicates the failure of an actuating flashing light (12, 13) of the traction vehicle by means of an increased flashing frequency. The control input, or each control input, (E1, E2; 27, 26) of the flasher unit (17) is connected to switching means (24) which, when the trailer is electrically connected, switch the control input, or each control input (E1, E2; 27, 26) in such a way that in the event of an actuated flashing light (12, 13, 14) of the train set failing the flasher unit (17) switches to the increased flashing frequency.
