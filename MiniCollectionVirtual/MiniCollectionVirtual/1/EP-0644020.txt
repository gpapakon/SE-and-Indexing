<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides for a fastener driving device 
(10) having a housing (12) including a handle portion (14) 

and drive portion (44). A unitary movable structure (32) 
is mounted for pivotal movement, from a closed operating 

position in cooperating relation with a fixed structure 
into an open loading position and an actuating mechanism 

(48) is provided for actuating the power operated drive 
(20) to move through an operating cycle. An actuation 

prevention mechanism (202) is provided for preventing the 
actuation of a power operated drive (20) by the actuating 

mechanism (48) in response to the movement of the movable 
structure (32) from the closed operating position to the 

open loading position. A resilient guard structure (16) is 
disposed on the housing (12) and extends outwardly from the 

periphery thereof and a mechanical structure is provided 
for fixedly mounting the resilient guard structure (16) on 

the housing (12). Last fastener holding means (256) are 
provided for retaining the last fastener of the array 

within a drive track (26) such that the last fastener of 
the array is driven outwardly of the drive track (26) and 

into a workpiece during the drive stroke of the fastener 
driving element (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastener
driving device and in particular, but not exclusively,
to a portable power-actuated fastener driving device.A common type of fastener package used in
conjunction with portable power-actuated fastener
driving devices is the coil fastener package. This
fastener package is made up of a series of headed
nails in a spaced parallel array interconnected by an
elongated flexible carrier. Carriers come in several
different forms. A well known one being a pair of
parallel wires welded to the shanks of each nail in
the array so as to maintain them in substantially
parallel relation. With this arrangement, the portion
of the wires which extend between each pair of
adjacent parallel nails acts in effect like a parallel
linkage.The utilization of nails of this type is
highly desirable because larger numbers of nails are
frequently packaged in coil formation. Fastener
driving devices utilizing coiled nail packages
typically include a feeding mechanism, a cylindrical
container into which a new coiled nail package is
placed, and a feed track therebetween. The feeding
mechanism for coiled nail packages of the type
described have heretofore been of the rachet type an
example of which is disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,858,812 to Fealey. Because of the
nature in which the successive nails are
interconnected, it is important that the leading
portion of the nail package be properly positioned
within the drive track and engaged with the rachet 
feed mechanism. To assure proper positioning of the
nails, operator access to the drive track, feed
mechanism, feed track and coil container must be
provided.Access is usually provided to each of the
above mentioned members by multiple doors which permit
the operator to load a new coiled nail package into
the device. An advantage of multiple door
construction is that each of the doors is relatively
small, light, and close to its axis of rotation. This
arrangement permits the device to be conveniently
handled by the operator when reloading. However,
problems are encountered with this type of
arrangement. This arrangement requires the operator
to typically use both hands to load the fastener
package into the device. Thus, the device is
generally placed down to enable the operator to load
the device. Time is wasted in opening each door and
in placing down the device. Further, the fabrication
and assembly of multiple doors adds additional cost.One proposal to provide single door access
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,600,135. The
arrangement
