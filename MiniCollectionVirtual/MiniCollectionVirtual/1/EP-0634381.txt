<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the preparation of alpha-olefin
oligomers which are useful as synthetic lubricants and functional fluids and more
particularly to a BF3-promoter catalyst system which uses a polyether modifier to
control the oligomer product distribution and provide higher percentages of lower
oligomers.Alpha-olefin oligomers and their use as synthetic lubricants ("synlubes")
are well-known. The oligomers are usually hydrogenated in order to improve their
stability. Early reports of such synlubes are in Seger et al. U.S. Pat. No. 2,500,161
and Garwood U.S. Pat. No. 2,500,163. U.S. Pat. No. 2,766,312 describes the
oligomerization of α-olefins in a Group IV metal oxide bed using a BF3-protic
promoter catalyst. Promoters include water, carboxylic acid, alkyl halides, alcohols
and ethers. U.S. Pat. No. 2,806,072 discloses the dimerization of C6-C12
polypropylenes
using a preformed BF3-dialkylether catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 3,382,291
describes the oligomerization of olefins using BF3-promoter catalyst complexes which
include acid anhydrides, esters, ketones and aldehydes. U.S. Pat. No. 4,172,855
describes BF3-promoter catalysts for grafting a second α-olefin onto C6-C12
α-olefin
dimer to form a low volatility lubricating oil. The promoters include glycol ethers
such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, and diisobutyl
ether.The particular application for which the oligomer oils are used depends
upon their viscosity, with viscosities of about 2-10 cSt at 100°C being preferred for
general lubricating oil applications. These materials are mixtures of different
percentages of dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer and higher oligomers, which oligomers
are produced in different proportions in the oligomerization process. In order
to increase the viscosity, processes are used which either produce more of the higher
oligomers or some of the lower oligomers are removed such as by distillation. Most 
lower viscosity dimer products are obtained as by-products of the production of higher
viscosity synthetic oils. Due to the increasing use of dimers in applications such as
low temperature lubricants and drilling fluids, methods for their preferential production
are of interest. It is known that higher temperatures favor dimer production, but
such higher temperatures can cause corrosion of production equipment. U.S. Pat. No.
5,068,487 discloses a process for making predominantly dimers and trimers of α-olefins
using an alcohol alkoxylate promoted BF3 catalyst. U.S. Pat. No.
