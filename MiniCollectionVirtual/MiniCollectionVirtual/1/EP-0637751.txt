<ABSTRACT>
A pace calculation device including an oscillator 1 
and a frequency divider 2 used for timing purposes, an 

amplifier 6 and a speaker 7 for generating a signal sound, 
and a CPU 3 for performing an operation. Times taken for a 

runner to run any first distance twice each at a different 
pace to the signal sound are measured. The CPU 3 draws a 

relation between a pace and a run time on the basis of data 
on two different paces at each of which the runner run the 

first distance and data on the run times taken for the 
runner to run. A run time taken for the runner to run at 

any pace any second distance which the runner should run in 
a target run time is measured. The CPU 3 calculates a pace 

at which the runner runs the second distance in the target 
run time on the basis of the relation, data on the pace at 

which the runner run the second distance, and the run time 
taken for that run. The speaker 7 generates a signal sound 

on the basis of data on the pace calculated by the CPU 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pace maker
which determines a pace at which a person moves, for
example, by walking or running.Generally, it is an important element that a runner
runs while keeping his pace in a marathon or a long
distance (for example, 10 km) running race in athletic
sports. A runner participating in such a long distance
running race can use a pace maker in his exercise.The pace maker generates a signal such as a sound at
given periods to the runner. The runner is able to run to
the signal to keep his own pace.Conventionally, a wrist watch having the function of
generating a signal sound at a given period is known as a
pace maker, which can change the period of the generated
signal sound so as to match with a pace which the runner
desires. When the runner runs, he wears this pace maker on
his wrist. Such a pace maker is known from US-A-5 050 141.US 4 285 041 discloses a pacing timer or a runner which is
able to generate a sound according to different pre-programmed
frequencies which could be accelerated or slowed
down during the race. In the beginning the runner has to
enter into the memory of such a device the distances in which
the runner sub-divides the whole race, the target times for
each of these distances and the stride length the runner
wishes to use for each distance.However, the conventional pace maker has only the
function of changing the period of generating a signal
sound. Therefore, for example, it cannot be used in a
manner in which, for example, a target run time taken for a
runner to run any distance beforehand is determined and a
pace appropriate for run of that distance in accordance
with the target run time is set. In this case, in order to obtain a pace p (for
example, the number of steps per minute) at which the
runner runs a course of a distance d in a target run time
t, data items on the step w of the runner, distance d and
target run time t are input to the device and the pace p is
then required to be calculated in accordance with the
following relation:
p = d รท w รท t.Since the conventional pace makers have no such
function, they cannot be used in a manner in which a pace
appropriate for run of any distance in accordance with the 
target run time is set, as mentioned above.Even if a pace maker is provided which is capable of
obtaining a pace p by calculation such as is mentioned
above, the number of data items to be set is large and the
operation for keying in those data items is troublesome.Some data items to set are unclear unless they are
measured
