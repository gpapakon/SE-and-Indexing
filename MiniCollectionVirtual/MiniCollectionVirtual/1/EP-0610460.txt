<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for thermally treating rails, in particular rails heads, according to which the rails are cooled in a synthetic additive-containing cooling medium from temperatures above 720  C. In order to prevent the stem of the rail from hardening while maintaining optimum cooling speeds for the rail head, immersion in the cooling medium is continued until a surface temperature between 450  C and 550  C is obtained after drawing the submerged areas of the rails without temperature equalization over the whole cross section.

<CLAIMS>
Method for heat treating rails, in particular
the rail head, in which method, the rail or rail head

is cooled, starting from temperatures above 720°C, by
an immersion in a coolant to which synthetic

admixtures, such as glycols or polyglycols, for
example, are added in an amount which, in the case of a

bath temperature of between 35°C and 55°C, effects the
transition from film boiling into the boiling phase in

the case of a surface temperature of between 450°C and
550°C and the desired instant for drawing of the rail

results therefrom, and the cooling is interrupted after
the boiling point has been reached by drawing from the

coolant and is continued slowly outside the coolant
bath, with the rail having at the end of the cooling,

after the drawing of the immersed regions, a surface
temperature of between 450°C and 550°C without

equalisation of temperature over the entire cross-section.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the rail foot is cooled with compressed air and/or

a water-air mixture.
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that a steel having the guide analysis

0.65 - 0.85% C, 0.01 - 1.2% Si, 0.5 - 3.5% Mn,
0.01 - 1.0% Cr, the remainder Fe and usual impurities,

is subjected to the heat treatment.
