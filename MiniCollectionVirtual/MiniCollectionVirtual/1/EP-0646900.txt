<ABSTRACT>
The pager comprises a radio receiver (1), a 
control unit (2), a liquid crystal display (3), control 

elements (4) and a battery operated power supply (5). A 
pattern memory (6) and a pattern control (7) are used for 

generating the bitmap pattern for each symbol that can be 
displayed. The pattern memory (6) can be modified to allow 

a user to select preferred patterns and sizes for the 
displayed symbols. Furthermore, the pattern memory (6) 

holds the patterns for a plurality of character sizes for 
the alphanumeric symbols. The pattern control can be set 

to select the character size of a message to be displayed 
automatically. In this case, the message is displayed as 

large as possible while still fitting into the display. 
In this way it becomes possible to optimize 
the use of the limited size of the display of a pager.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a radio pager having 
a matrix display for displaying patterns corresponding to 
symbols from a set of symbols and a pattern generating 
means for generating said patterns for displaying said 
symbols on said display. The invention also relates to 
a method for displaying a message on such a radio pager. Modern radio pagers are equipped with a matrix 
display, usually a liquid-crystal display (LCD) or a 
VDU, for displaying received messages, information on the 
internal status of the device, etc. Since pagers are portable 
devices that should fit in a pocket, size is a critical 
parameter and the area of the display is limited. 
However, they should be able to display about 100 characters 
at a time. Therefore, the size of each character 
is in the order of 5mm x 4mm. A normally sighted user 
reading the pager's display from a distance of approximately 
30 cm in a well lit place will usually be able to 
recognize the displayed characters easily. However, problems 
occur for users with a poor sight or in difficult 
conditions. Therefore, it is a goal of the present invention 
to provide a radio pager with a display that is easily 
readable and a method for operating such a pager. This goal is achieved by the characterizing 
portions of the independent claims. The inventive apparatus and method provide a 
possibility to make the best use of the limited display 
space available in a radio pager. Conventional pagers 
generate one fixed pattern for each symbol. In the inventive 
pager, the pattern generated for a symbol can vary. 
It can e.g. be possible to modify the patterns stored in 
the pager, or more than one single pattern can be provided  
 
for each symbol. Since the patterns of the displayed 
symbols are variable, each symbol can be represented 
using an optimum size and shape. In a preferred embodiment, the size of the 
patterns is chosen such that a message to be displayed 
fills the display. Short messages will therefore appear 
in a larger character size and be much easier to read. 
Also, the minimum character or symbol size can be chosen 
by the user. Users with a poor eye sight can choose 
larger patterns. If a writable memory for storing the symbol 
patterns and a suitable interface or controls are provided, 
the patterns of the symbols can be customized. In 
this way it becomes possible to use patterns (characters, 
icons, pictures) that are familiar to the user and are 
compatible with his or her cultural background and experience. More objects and advantages of

<CLAIMS>
Radio pager having a matrix display (3) 
for displaying patterns, corresponding to symbols from a 

set of symbols and a pattern generating means (6, 7) for 
generating said patterns for displaying said symbols on 

said display (3), wherein said pattern generating means 
(6, 7) is designed to allow a plurality of possible 

patterns for at least some of said symbols. 
Radio pager of claim 1 wherein said pattern 
generating means (6, 7) comprises a pattern memory 

(6) for storing at least one pattern for at least some of 
said symbols. 
Radio pager of claim 2, comprising a means 
for modifying the contents of said pattern memory (6). 
Radio pager of claim 3, wherein said means 
for modifying the contents of said pattern memory (6) 

comprises an interface (8) for connecting said radio 
pager to external programming unit. 
Radio pager of one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said pattern generating means (6, 7) is 

adapted to generate patterns in a plurality of sizes for 
at least some of said symbols. 
Radio pager of claim 5, comprising a user 
control means (4) for selecting a default size of said 

patterns. 
Method for displaying a message on the radio 
pager of one of the preceding claims, said message 

being expressed by a sequence of symbols from said set of 
symbols, said method comprising a selection step for 

finding a largest character size from a set of character 
sizes for the patterns of the symbols of said message 

such that said message still fits in said display. 
Method of claim 7, wherein. if no largest 
character size is found in said selection step, a default 

character size is used for the display patterns of the 
symbols of said message. 
Method of one of the claims 7 or 8, 
wherein said largest character size is determined from 

the number of symbols required for expressing said message.
