<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetooptical recording apparatus, a light 
beam is radiated onto a magnetooptical recording medium 

while applying a bias magnetic field to the recording 
medium in such a manner that at least one of the light 

beam and the bias magnetic field is modulated according 
to an information signal. A current to be supplied 

from a DC power supply to the bias magnetic field 
applying device is switched by a switch element. The 

current switched by the switch element is smoothed by a 

smoothing circuit. The current to be supplied from the 
DC power supply to the bias magnetic field device is 

detected by a current detection element. A ratio 
between ON and OFF time periods of the switch element 

is changed in correspondence with an error between a 
value detected b the current detection element and a 

pre-set reference value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light intensity
modulation or magnetic field modulation type
magnetooptical recording apparatus and, more
particularly, to drive devices for an
electromagnet for generating erasing and recording bias
magnetic fields in a light intensity modulation type
apparatus, and for a magnetic head for generating a
recording modulated magnetic field in a magnetic field
modulation type apparatus.Conventionally, as typical magnetooptical
recording methods for recording information on a
magnetooptical recording medium, a light intensity
modulation method and a magnetic field modulation
method are known. The two recording methods will be
briefly described below. Fig. 1 shows the schematic
arrangement of a light intensity modulation type
magnetooptical recording apparatus. Referring to
Fig. 1, a recording layer 1a is formed on a
magnetooptical disk 1 as an information recording
medium. The disk 1 is rotated at a predetermined speed
by a spindle motor 7. An electromagnet 2 as a magnetic
field generator is arranged above the upper surface of 
the magnetooptical disk 1, and an optical head 5 is
arranged below the lower surface of the disk 1 at a
position opposite to the electromagnet 2. The
electromagnet 2 is obtained by winding an excitation
coil 2b around a magnetic core 2a, and generates a
magnetic field for erasing or recording information
when it is driven by an electromagnet drive circuit 3.
The optical head 5 comprises a semiconductor laser 5a
as a light source, an objective lens for converging a
laser beam emitted from the laser 5a to a small beam
spot, and radiating the beam spot on the recording
layer 1a, and the like. The optical head 5 radiates a
laser beam modulated according to an information signal
onto the recording layer 1a when it is driven by a
laser drive circuit 6.When information is to be recorded, a control
signal for instructing recording of information is
supplied to the electromagnet drive circuit 3, and the
electromagnet drive circuit 3 drives the electromagnet
2 on the basis of the instruction. Thus, a DC
recording current is supplied to the excitation coil 2b
of the electromagnet 2, and the electromagnet 2
generates a recording bias magnetic field in a
predetermined direction and applies it to the
magnetooptical disk 1. On the other hand, the laser
drive circuit 6 generates a drive current modulated
according to an input information signal, and drives 
the semiconductor laser 5a by the generated drive
current. Thus, a laser beam from the semiconductor
laser 5a
