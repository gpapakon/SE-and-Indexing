 SIZER APPARATUS HAVING SHIFTABLE HORNBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThe present invention concerns a sizer for stuffing flowable materials such as sausage into a flex¬ ible casing. More particularly, the invention concerns a horn assembly having inner and outer concentric tubes presenting an evacuation chamber therebetween connected to a vacuum source. The tubes are shiftable relative to one another between an open position in which the chamber communicates with the interior of the inner tube through an open space adjacent the discharge ends of the tubes for evacuating air from material within the inner tube, and a closed position in which the open space is sealed to prevent communication between the chamber and the inner tube interior thereby preventing entry of material into the chamber.2. Description of the Prior ArtWhen stuffing flowable materials such as sausage and hamburger into a casing, residual air pockets can result in voids in the finished product and holes in the sliced product. Prior art devices and techniques attempt to keep the flowable materials under vacuum during pro¬ cessing and stuffing in order to remove excess air much as that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,035,671, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In so doing, however, the flowable material has a tendency to enter the vacuum passages which can plug the passages and create sanitation problems. Accordingly, the prior art points out the need for a sizer which removes air from the flowable product being stuffed without plugging vacuum lines and attendant sanitation problems. 

 Summary of the InventionThe present invention overcomes the problems discussed above and provides a distinct advance in the state of the art. That is to say, the preferred sizer and horn assembly hereof effectively removes air from flowable material and the casing into which it is being stuffed without plugging the vacuum passages used to remove the air.Broadly speaking, the preferred sizer includes a horn assembly, an inlet structure for delivering flowable material to the assembly, and an actuatable piston for ejecting a charge of flowable material through the horn assembly and into the product casing. The preferred horn assembly includes inner and outer, concentric tubes longitudinally shiftable relative to one another and presenting an evacuation chamber therebetween, a shifting mechanism for selectively shifting the tubes between open and closed positions, and sealing structure for sealing an open space between

CLAIMS :
1. A horn assembly adapted for coupling to a source of flowable material and to receive a flexible casing thereover permitting the casing to be filled with said material, said horn assembly comprising: an elongated, outer tube presenting an inlet end and an outlet end; an elongated, inner tube presenting an inlet end and an outlet end and situated within said outer tube and defining with the latter an open area between the outer and inner tubes; shifting means operably coupled with at least one of said outer and inner tubes for selective, rela¬ tive axial movement between the tubes such that the tubes can assume alternate first and second relatively shifted positions; sealing means for sealing said open area between said tubes when the tubes assume said first shifted position, and for permitting communication between said open area and the interior of said inner tube when the tubes assume said second shifted position; and means in operative communication with said open area between said tubes for selective withdrawal of air therefrom when said tubes assume said second shifted position.
2. The horn assembly of Claim 1, wherein said inner tube is substantially concentrically disposed relative to said outer tube.
3. The horn assembly of Claim 1, said outer tube being stationary, said shifting means being coupled with said inner tube for selective, relatively axially movement of the inner tube relative to the outer tube. 


 4. The horn assembly of Claim 1, said sealing means comprising an annular seal adjacent the outlet end of said outer tube and engageable with said outlet end of said inner tube.
5. The horn assembly of Claim 1, said shifting means comprising a pneumatic piston and cylinder assembly having a shiftable piston rod, and means operably coupling said rod with at least one of said outer and inner tubes.
6. The horn assembly of Claim 1, including structure defining a flowable material inlet adjacent the inlet end of said inner tube and communicating with the interior of the latter.
7. The horn assembly of Claim 1, said air withdrawal means comprising an air-conveying tube in communication with said open area and adapted for coupling with a vacuum pump.
8. The horn assembly of Claim 1, including means positioned about said outer tube proximal to the output end thereof for gripping a casing applied over the horn assembly during filling of the casing.
9. The horn assembly of Claim 1, said outer tube including an evacuation port structure defined therethrough for evacuating air from between said outer tube and a casing placed thereover.
10. The horn assembly of claim 9, there being a groove in the outer surface of said outer tube and presenting a bottom wall, said evacuation port structure including at least one slot through said groove bottom wall. 


 11. Sizing apparatus for handling a flowable material and discharging the same as discrete portions, said apparatus comprising: a horn assembly including— an elongated, outer tube presenting an inlet end and an outlet end; an elongated, inner tube presenting an inlet end and an outlet end and situated within said outer tube and defining with the latter an open area between the outer and inner tubes; shifting means operably coupled with at least one of said outer and inner tubes for selective, rela¬ tive axial movement between the tubes such that the tubes can assume alternate first and second relatively shifted positions; sealing means for sealing said open area between said tubes when the tubes assume said first shifted position, and for permitting communication between said open area and the interior of said inner tube when the tubes assume said second shifted position; and means in operative communication with said open area between said tubes for selective withdrawal of air therefrom when said tubes assume said second shifted position; inlet structure in communication with said inner tube and adapted for coupling with a material pump for delivery of said flowable material to the interior of said inner tube; a selective actuatable piston situated adjacent the input ends of said outer and inner tubes and operable for selective forward movement thereof from an initial position rearward of said inlet structure and into the confines of said inner tube for ejecting a charge of flowable material 



 out said outlet end of the inner tube and into said casing for filling of the latter, and for rearward movement thereof back to said initial position.
12. The sizing apparatus of Claim 11, wherein said inner tube is substantially concentrically relative to said outer tube.
13. The sizing apparatus of Claim 11, said outer tube being stationary, said shifting means being coupled with said inner tube for selective, relatively axially movement of the inner tube relative to the outer tube.
14. The sizing apparatus of Claim 11, said sealing means comprising an annular seal adjacent the outlet end of said outer tube and engageable with said outlet end of said inner tube.
15. The sizing apparatus of Claim 11, said shifting means comprising a pneumatic piston and cylinder assembly having a shiftable piston rod, and means operably coupling said rod with at least one of said outer and inner tubes.
16. The sizing apparatus of Claim 11, said air withdrawal means comprising an air-conveying tube in communication with said open area and adapted for coupling with a vacuum pump.
17. The sizing apparatus of Claim 11, including means positioned about said outer tube proximal to the output end thereof for gripping a casing applied over the horn assembly during filling of the casing.
