<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic device with a plurality of logic stages
forming a sequential circuit in an operational mode of the electronic device, the logic stages
having first switches in a signal path; and selection means for selectively reconfiguring the
plurality of stages to form a combinatorial logic circuit.To appreciate the invention, this section gives some background information
on logic circuitry, on testing of ICs, and on IDDQ-testing in particular.Logic circuitry can be divided into two classes: combinatorial logic circuitry
and sequential logic circuitry. A combinatorial logic circuit handles time-independent signal
correlations. That is, the logic state and the output signals of a combinatorial logic circuit are
solely determined by the instant logic input signals to the circuit. An example of a
combinatorial logic circuit is a plurality of interconnected logic gates. A sequential logic
circuit, on the other hand, takes history into account. The succession of logic states adopted
by a sequential logic circuit is such that a next logic state is determined under combined
control of input signals and the circuit's previous logic state. Within this context, a counter, a
shift register, a master-slave flipflop and a chain of flipflops are typical examples of a
sequential logic circuit.JP-A-56153838 shows a circuit that can be switched from a sequential to a
combinatorial circuit under control of a control signal. The feedback loops of the circuit
contain a propagating gate under control of the control signal. When the control signal is a
logic 0, the propagating gates are not conducting and the feedback loops are disconnected
from the signal path of the circuit. Two further propagating gates in the signal path of the
circuit are controlled by two 2-input NAND gates, having their first inputs connected to
respective clock signals and their second inputs connected to the control signal. Because of 
the logical condition of the NAND gates, both further propagating gates are always
connected when the control signal is logic low, thus making the circuit into a combinatorial
circuit. When the control signal is a logic 1, the propagating gates in the feedback loops are
connected and the propagating gates in the signal path are connected and disconnected in
accordance with the logical values of the clock signals, making the circuit perform a flipflop
operation as a sequential circuit.Systematic and automatic testing of electronic circuitry, and of integrated
circuits in particular, has
