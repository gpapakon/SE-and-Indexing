<ABSTRACT>
The application relates to a method for determining the oxygen demand in the case of oxidation processes, especially the biochemical oxygen demand, in which oxygen can be fed into a closed system of a sample of the substrate to be examined, as a function of the pressure in the system, an adsorber for CO2 produced in the system generally being present. The method is characterised in that, for examining a solid sample, flushing water enriched with a constant quantity of oxygen is fed from below to this sample and the water is discharged from the sample via the top, and the oxygen quantity produced is measured or determined.

A method of determining the biochemical oxygen requirement in oxidation
processes, in which a specimen (P) of the substrate to be examined is introduced

into a closed system, oxygen being consumed in the closed system by microorganisms
introduced together with the specimen, so that a negative pressure is

created which is compensated by means of an oxygen generator, the quantity of
oxygen produced and required for compensation and measured constituting the

biochemical oxygen requirement of the specimen, an adsorber for C02 generated
in the system being generally present, characterised in that for examining

specimens of solids, a constant quantity of oxygen-enriched flushing water flows
through the specimen from the bottom upwards.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the flushing fluid is circulated
in a cycle and in a constant quantity.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the quantity of fluid
derived from the specimen (P) and in the form of a spread-out film is fed to a

collecting space situated in the vicinity of or at the lower level of the specimen
area.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that enrichment of

the flushing liquid with oxygen takes place above a lower limit value which is
above the maximum biochemical oxygen requirement.
An apparatus for carrying out the method, in which a specimen vessel (1) in which
the oxidation process takes place and a device for the pressure dependent release

of the feed of a flow of oxygen from a stock or an oxygen generator is provided
in a closed system, characterised in that the specimen Vessel (1) comprises an inner

container (2) containing the solids specimen (P) as well as a flushing water supply
line (6) and a flushing water discharge line (7). 
An apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in that the bottom of the
specimen vessel (1) serves as a space for collecting the flushing water, this latter

flowing to it after passing through the specimen as a film along the walls of the
inner container (2).
