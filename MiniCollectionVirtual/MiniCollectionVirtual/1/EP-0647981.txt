<ABSTRACT>
An antenna for a base station comprising a plurality of antenna arrays 
(40; Fig. 6a) each capable of forming a multiplicity of separate 

overlapping narrow beams in azimuth, the arrays being positioned 
such that the of beams formed by the arrays provide a coverage in 

azimuth wider than each array. Means are provided for recognising 
unique identifier signals (70; Fig. 6b) incorporated in call signals 

passing through the antenna; and coherent detection means for 
discriminating between unwanted call signals and wanted call signals 

using said unique identifier signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a base station antenna arrangement, for use 
in a Cellular Radio communications system. Cellular radio systems are currently increasing in use throughout the 
world providing telecommunications to mobile users. In order to meet 
the capacity demand, within the available frequency band allocation, 
cellular radio systems divide a geographic area to be covered into 
cells. At the centre of each cell is a base station, through which the 
mobile stations communicate. The available communication channels 
are divided between the cells such that the same group of channels 
are reused by certain cells. The distance between the reused cells is 
planned such that the co-channel interference is maintained at a 
tolerable level. When a new cellular radio system is initially deployed, operators are 
often interested in maximising the uplink (mobile station to base 
station) and downlink (base station to mobile station) range. The 
ranges in many systems are uplink limited due to the relatively low 
transmitted power levels of hand portable mobile stations. Any 
increase in range means that less cells are required to cover a given 
geographic area, hence reducing the number of base stations and 
associated infrastructure costs. When a cellular radio system is mature the capacity demand can often 
increase, especially in cities, to a point where more, smaller size cells 
are needed in order to meet the required capacity per unit area. The 
process used to create these smaller cells is known as cell splitting. 
Any technique that can provide additional capacity without the need for  
 
cell-splitting will again reduce the number of base station sites and 
associated infrastructure costs. The antenna used at the base station site can potentially make 
significant improvements to the range and capacity of a cellular radio 
system. The ideal base station antenna pattern is a beam of narrow 
angular width as shown in Fig 1a. The narrow beam is directed at the 
wanted mobile, is narrow in both the azimuth and elevation planes, and 
tracks the mobile's movements. When compared to an omni-directional 
antenna, such a beam will have the dual benefits of having high gain, 
leading to increased range in thermal noise limited initial deployments, 
and rejecting interference from co-channel reuse cells allowing higher 
capacity without cell splitting in mature deployments. The narrow beam 
reduces interference in a balanced manner on the uplink and downlink. 
On the uplink the base station receiver is

<CLAIMS>
An antenna comprising 
   a plurality of layered antenna arrays (40; Fig. 6a) each capable 

of forming a multiplicity of separate overlapping narrow beams in 
azimuth, the arrays being positioned such that the beams provide a 

coverage in azimuth wider than each array; 
   characterised in that the antenna includes 

   means for recognising unique identifier signals (70; Fig. 6b) 
incorporated in call signals passing through the antenna; and 

   coherent detection means for discriminating between unwanted 
call signals and wanted call signals using said unique identifier signals. 
A smart antenna arrangement as claimed in claim 2 wherein 
said unique identifier signals are incorporated in a so-called training 

sequence within a call signal structure. 
An antenna according to claim 1 or 2 further including; 
   azimuth beamforming means (44,46; Fig 6a) for each array; 

   a plurality of r.f. transceivers (84; Fig 6b) each for transmitting 
and receiving r.f. signals for one or more calls; 

   switching matrix means (78, 82; Fig. 6b) for connecting each 
transceiver with one or other of the arrays via the beamforming means; 

   and control means (80; Fig. 6b, 64; Fig. 6a) for controlling the 
switch matrix means whereby a particular transceiver is connected to a 

particular array, via the beamforming means, to exchange r.f. signals 
with a remote station located in the area covered by the antenna.
