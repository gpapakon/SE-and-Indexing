<ABSTRACT>
In a firearm, for example a quick fire weapon (10), the rear end (22) of the barrel ends at the front end (24) of the path of movement of a movably guided breech block inside the breech body (12) and is directly or indirectly secured at its outer side to the breech body (12) by means of a one-piece or multiple-piece adapter (14). The section of the inside of the breech body directly adjacent to the rear end (22) of the barrel communicates with the environing air by at least one gas channel (26, 20; 26', 20) which extends forwards. A pressurized gas which accumulates inside the breech body (12) in the case of certain rare disturbances is thus deviated in time, i.e. before damages are caused. Preferably the pressurized gas is introduced into the inside (28) of a handguard (18) and escapes outwards through its cooling holes (20). Additional radial safety openings (30) acts as further "safety valves".

<CLAIMS>
Fire-arm (10) having a barrel (16) 

a) of which the rearward end (22) of the barrel 
a1) borders on the front end of the path of 
movement of a breech-block guided movably in the 

interior of a weapon housing (12), and 
a2) is fastened on its outside to the weapon 
housing directly or indirectly through an adapter 

(14), 
 
characterised in that
 
b) the section of the interior of the weapon 

housing bordering directly on the rearward end (22) of 
the barrel is connected to the ambient air through at 

least one gas channel (26, 26') extending towards the 
front. 
Fire-arm (10) according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the gas channel has longitudinal grooves (26') in 

the outer wall of the rearward end (22) of the barrel. 
Fire-arm (10) according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the gas channel has longitudinal 

recesses (26) in the housing wall or in the adapter 
(14), preferably in the area of the latter bordering on 

the rearward end (22) of the barrel. 
Fire-arm (10) according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at the front end of the 

longitudinal grooves (26') or of the longitudinal 
recesses (26) an expansion chamber (28) is arranged 

which discharges into the surroundings through at least 
one compensating opening (20). 
Fire-arm (10) according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it is constructed as a 

portable fire-arm, preferably as a long weapon, which  
 

has a hollow front stock or hand guard (18) with cooling 
holes (20) and that the space enclosed by the hollow 

hand guard (18) is constructed as an expansion chamber 
(28) and the at least single cooling hole (20) is 

constructed as a compensating opening. 
Fire-arm (10) according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by at least one additional safety 

bore (30) which is directed radially outwards from the 
section of the interior of the weapon housing bordering 

on the rearward end (22) of the barrel into a protected 
space (34). 
Fire-arm (10) according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the safety bore (30) is filled with plastic (36). 
Fire-arm (10) according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the exit of the additional safety bore (30) is 

covered in such a way that the covering (32) breaks open 
or comes loose only on reaching an excess pressure 

threshold.
