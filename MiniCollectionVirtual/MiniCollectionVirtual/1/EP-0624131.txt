<ABSTRACT>
The tubular reinforcing bearer (2) has a circular cross-section. By comparison with the end sections used for securing to the inside of the door, in the central longitudinal section (1) has a greater resistance to bending stresses. To this end, in the central longitudinal section (1), at least one sheet-steel strip (4) extending parallel to the longitudinal axis (3) of the bearer is tangentially secured in a plane to the impact direction (5) on the periphery side. The width (B) of the sheet-steel strip (4) is overall smaller than the thickness (D) of the bearer. It narrows in accordance with the bending moment curve towards the ends (7) of the sheet-steel strip (4). The reduction in width can be linear or parabolic.

<CLAIMS>
A tubular reinforcement member for a vehicle door 
having rounded contours both internally and externally, 

wherein two sheet-steel strips (4) are welded 
tangentially to the outer periphery in the central 

portion of the length (1), in planes parallel to the 
impact direct (5), and which on the side remote from 

the impact direction (5) has at least one indentation 
(8), the width (B) of the sheet-steel strips (4), 

taking into account the depth of the indentation (8), 
being narrower than the thickness (D) of the 

reinforcement member (2).
