<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the micromechanical component according to the invention, for example a motor, all the micromechanical structures (rotor 6R, rotation shaft 6D, stator 6S) are produced from the same layer or multiple layer (6), in that, for example, chemical vapour-deposition tungsten is deposited into suitable trenches (5). In consequence, there are no adjustment problems. The static micromechanical structures (6S, 6D) are connected by means of electrical and/or mechanical connecting means (9S, 9D) to the substrate (1) located underneath, it being possible to produce security against the moving micromechanical structures (6R) falling out, at the same time. The production process is compatible with the production of integrated circuits on silicon and requires only three photographic levels.
