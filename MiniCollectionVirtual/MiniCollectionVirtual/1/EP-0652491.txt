<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus for a copying machine, a printer, etc., which is 

provided with an electrifying member disposed opposite to 
the surface of a photosensitive body and electrifying the 

surface thereof by applying electric charge thereto. An 
electrifying member disposed opposite to the surface of a 

photosensitive body and electrifying the surface thereof 
by application of electric charge has a curved or flat 

face along the surface of the photosensitive body and 
resistance from 10⁵ to 10¹⁰ ohms, and at the same time the 

electrifying member is disposed about 350µm to about 
1000µm from the surface of the photosensitive body. The 

electrifying member may be curved to meet the curvature of 
the surface of the photosensitive body. A conductive 

portion to apply voltage to the electrifying member may be 
formed at the side of the electrifying member, which is 

opposite to the side facing the surface of the 
photosensitive body. Still furthermore, the electrifying 

member may be supported by the conductive portion formed 
at the electrifying member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus for a copying machine, a printer, etc, which is 
provided with an electrifying member disposed opposite to 
the surface of a photosensitive body and electrifying the 
surface thereof by applying electric charge thereto. For example, in an image forming apparatus of 
electronic photography system, an electrifier of corona 
discharge system has been generally employed. However, the 
corona discharge system generates a great deal of harmful 
products such as ozone, etc. Therefore, there is caused 
such a problem that may result in large sizing, an 
increase of production cost, etc., in order to make 
countermeasures against them. For this reason, an ozone-free 
electric charge application system which hardly has 
such problems has recently been taken into consideration. Fig. 4 is a view showing the outline configuration of 
one of the examples of such a conventional image forming 
apparatus A.  As shown in Fig. 4, in the conventional image forming 
apparatus A, an electrifying roller 1 is brought into 
contact with a drum-like photosensitive body 1 with 
pressure, and is driven in line with revolutions of the 
photosensitive body 2. The electrifying roller 1 is a 
conductive member made of, for example, silicon and nylon, 
and has a fixed resistance (10⁵ to 10⁹ ohms). Voltage is 
applied to the electrifying roller 1 through the rotation 
axis thereof from a power source 3. A certain potential is applied to the photosensitive 
body 2 from the pressure-contacting surface of the 
electrifying roller 1 by application of the voltage. 
However, as no electric discharge is generated at this 
time, harmful products such as ozone, etc., are hardly 
generated. Namely, it is possible to achieve an ozone-free 
electric charge. Next, light exposure 4 is applied to the uniformly 
electrified surface of the photosensitive body 2 by a 
light exposing means (not illustrated). An electrostatic 
latent image of the target image information is gradually 
formed on the circumferential surface of the 
photosensitive body 2 by this light exposure 4. And the 
latent image is developed by a developing roller 5 as a 
toner image. Next, the latent image is gradually 
transferred onto a sheet of paper, which is fed by a paper  
 
feeding mechanism (not illustrated), by a transferring 
roller 6. The sheet of paper is separated from the 
photosensitive body 2 after the latent image is 
transferred thereto and is fed to a fixing device (not 
illustrated), wherein the
