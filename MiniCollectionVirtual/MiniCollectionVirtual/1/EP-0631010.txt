<ABSTRACT>
A process for enhancing pulp washing efficiency 
is disclosed. An anionic surfactant of the formula 

R- (OCH₂CH₂)
n
OSO₃M wherein R is alkyl, aryl or 
alkylaryl, M is H or a water soluble cation, and n is 

from about 1 to about 30 is added within the washing 
or pulping operation to enhance the removal of lignin 

and spent cooling chemicals from pulp.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for increasing 
the efficiency of pulp washing by decreasing the tendency for 
lignin to remain in the fibrous mat after washing. The manufacture of paper from wood requires many complex 
steps, including the formation of pulp fiber from wood chips. 
This process takes place in a digester, where wood chips are 
cooked at high temperature with sodium sulphide and sodium 
hydroxide in order to break down and solubilize the lignin, so 
that it can be separated from the wood pulp. The most prominent 
by-product of the process is kraft lignin, a complex three-dimensional 
material based on repeating phenol propane units. The lignin and spent cooking chemicals are contained in 
the liquid fraction, often referred to as black liquor, of the 
brown stock.  
 
Additional by-products found in the black liquor include wood 
pitch and hemicelluloses (low molecular weight polysaccharides). 
When pine is used, crude tall oil and turpentine become very 
important by-products. Following the digester, the black liquor (containing 
organics, mostly lignin, and inorganic spent cooking chemicals) is 
separated from the wood pulp in a process commonly known as brown 
stock washing. Rotary drum washers placed in series are commonly 
used to wash brown stock. Generally, these drums are made up of 
different washing zones. The first washing step within a drum is 
usually dilution/thickening, where the brown stock is diluted with 
liquid which is cleaner than the liquid within the brown stock. 
After the stock is thickened on the vacuum drum, a second washing 
step of displacement is usually conducted. In the displacement 
phase, liquid which is cleaner than the mat of pulp is applied to 
the mat surface via showers and pulled through the pulp mat to 
displace the dirty liquid held within it. Kraft brown stock 
washing can also be conducted with variations of this washing 
technique. Other washing methods include pressure washers, which 
use pressure rather than vacuum, and belt washers, which use 
displacement. Brown stock washing is important to the pulp mill 
operation. Digester cooking chemicals are recovered for reuse 
during washing. Pulp mills also burn the organics for their 
heating value. Therefore, the efficient collection of organics  
 
from the pulp is very important to an effective pulp mill 
operation. Bleaching, which often follows brown stock washing, is 
more efficient when the brown stock washers remove the most 
by-product solids possible. The brown stock washing
