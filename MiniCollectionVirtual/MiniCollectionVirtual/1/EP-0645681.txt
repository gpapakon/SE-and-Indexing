<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the preparation of
carrier particles intended to be mixed with toner
particles to form a dry electrostatographic developer.
The invention more particularly relates to a method of
modifying the triboelectric charging propensity of
fluorocarbon coated particles.In electrostatography, image charge patterns
are formed on a support and are developed by treatment
with an electrostatographic developer containing
marking particles which are attracted to the charge
patterns. These particles are called toner particles
or, collectively, toner. The image charge pattern,
also referred to as an electrostatic latent image, is
formed on an insulative surface of an electrostatographic
element by any of a variety of methods. For
example, the electrostatic latent image may be formed
electrophotographically, by imagewise photo-induced
dissipation of the strength of portions of an
electrostatic field of uniform strength previously
formed on the surface of an electrophotographic element
comprising a photoconductive layer and an electrically
conductive substrate. Alternatively, the electrostatic
latent image may be formed by direct electrical
formation of an electrostatic field pattern on a
surface of a dielectric material.One well-known type of electrostatographic
developer comprises a dry mixture of toner particles
and carrier particles. Developers of this type are
employed in cascade and magnetic brush electrostatographic
development processes. The toner particles and
carrier particles differ triboelectrically, such that
during mixing to form the developer, the toner 
particles acquire a charge of one polarity and the
carrier particles acquire a charge of the opposite
polarity. The opposite charges cause the toner
particles to cling to the carrier particles. During
development, the electrostatic forces of the latent
image, sometimes in combination with an additional
applied field, attract the toner particles. The toner
particles are pulled away from the carrier particles
and become electrostatically attached, in imagewise
relation, to the latent image bearing surface. The
resultant toner image can then be fixed, by application
of heat or other known methods, depending upon the
nature of the toner image and the surface, or can be
transferred to another surface and then fixed.A number of requirements are implicit in such
development schemes. Namely, the electrostatic
attraction between the toner and carrier particles must
be strong enough to keep the toner particles held to
the surfaces of the
