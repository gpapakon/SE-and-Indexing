<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for improving purification of sludge containing mainly water, so that before a mechanical dewatering stage two components are added to the sludge in order to improve its dewatering properties. First a water-containing coagulating mixture is added, which contains a ferric salt and an organic polymer having a molecular weight of under 1 000 000, and then a polyelectrolyte with a molecular weight of above 3 000 000 is added.

<DESCRIPTION>
Process for purifying sludge containing mainly waterThis invention relates to a process for purifying sludge containing mainly water, especially a waste water sludge of the forest industry, wherein the dewatering properties of the sludge are improved before carrying out a mechanical dewatering of the sludge.Besides the house hold also the industries and, above all, the forest industry are producing waste water. The paper production is carried out from a diluted water suspension wherein water is an auxiliary driving medium.Waste water contains varying amounts of dissolved and solid organic and inorganic matter originating from used raw materials. Waste water thus pollutes the water system to which it is drained. The solid, insoluble matter makes the water turbid and forms a layer of sludge on the bottom of the water system. Organic matter, whether dissolved or solid, is consuming the oxygen of the water system, dyeing the water and giving directly or indirectly a taste or a smell to it.One way to purify waste water is by flocculation. Floc- culation or coagulation can be enhanced by varying the so- called zetapotential of the particles contained in the water by adding suitable chemicals. Because these additions only influence on the active sites on the solid material, quite small amounts of the chemicals are usually needed, i.e. generally 0.1-1 mg/1. If the flocculant has a high molecular weight, it is simultaneously also functioning as a pro¬ tecting colloid.There is a myriad of flocculants on market. They are water- soluble but can get hydrolyzed when diluted and form insoluble solid or colloidal matters, such as e.g. A1(0H)3. 

Because flocculants alone or as combined with the particles generally have an amphoteric nature, i.e. contain groups of opposite charges, or are salts of bases and acids, they may and act both anionically and cationically, according to the pH value of the environment. When both of the amphoteric groups contribute as much in the molecule or flake conglo¬ merate, which requires a certain hydrogen ion concentra¬ tion, the isoelectric point of the matter or flake has been reached. The zetapotential is then near the value of ±0mV„If the flocculant by itself forms flakes, such as e.g. Al(OH)3, Fe(OH)3 and Si02, the dissolved substances can be adsorbed to these flakes and thus get separated from the water to be purified. As an example the absorption of humus and coloring substances to the flakes of Al(OH)3 can be mentioned.In the following some usual flocculants are listed:The resin
