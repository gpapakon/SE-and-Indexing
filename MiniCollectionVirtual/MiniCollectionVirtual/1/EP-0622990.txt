<ABSTRACT>
Carbonated hydroxyapatite compositions and their preparation are described. The compositions are biologically resorbable and are prepared as flowable masses which can be administered by syringe to set in situ to serve as a support structure, filler, prosthesis or the like. Optionally the compositions may include proteins or serve as a depot for compositions of pharmacological interest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field concerns the preparation of substantially
pure compositions of carbonate-substituted forms of
hydroxyapatite, and the biomedical use of such
compositions.A number of calcium phosphate minerals, such as
hydroxyapatite, fluorapatite, octacalcium phosphate,
whitlockite, brushite and monetite may have application as
biocompatible materials. The various crystalline forms of
the calcium phosphate minerals can confer different 
physical properties that may be more or less desirable for
a specific biomedical application. For instance,
octacalcium phosphate and whitlockite are less resorbable
than brushite or monetite (Brown and Chow, Ann. Rev. of
Materials Science (1976) 6:213-236).Of particular interest are the apatites. Apatite is
a general term for a wide range of compounds represented
by the general formula M2+10(ZO43-)6Y-2, where M is a metal
atom, particularly an alkali or alkaline earth atom, ZO4
is an acid radical, where Z may be phosphorous, arsenic,
vanadium, sulphur, silicon, or may be substituted in whole
or in part by carbonate (CO32-), and Y is an anion, usually
halide, hydroxy, or carbonate. When ZO43- is partially or
wholly replaced by trivalent anions (such as CO32-) and/or
Y- is partially or wholly replaced by divalent anions,
then charge balance may be maintained in the overall
structure by additional monovalent cations (such as Na+)
and/or protonated acid radicals (such as HPO42-).Hydroxyapatite (HAp), as well as its various forms,
has been the focus of substantial interest because it is a
major structural component of biological tissues such as
bone, teeth, and some invertebrate skeletons. There are
many situations where bone has been broken, surgically
removed, destroyed, degraded, become too brittle, or been
subject to other deteriorating effects. In many of these
situations it would be desirable to be able to replace the
bone structure or Strengthen the bone structure. In
providing materials to substitute for natural bone, teeth,
or other calcified tissues, there are a number of
restraints on the natural composition of the material.Dental applications might prefer a fluoride
substituted hydroxyapatite, i.e. francolite, that would
reduce solubility and increase resistance to decay.The material should ideally possess certain
characteristics that facilitate the production, storage
life, and biomedical application of the material.
Specifically, a material which could be a material which
could be fingerpacked in an open surgical procedure or 
percutaneously injected as a flowable
