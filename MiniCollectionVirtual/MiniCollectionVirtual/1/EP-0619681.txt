<ABSTRACT>
A level standard signal including a level reference 
signal and an information signal is interposed in a particular 

horizontal scanning line (a 603-line) of an HD picture signal. 
An amplitude level of the HD picture signal is corrected 

according to the level reference signal in a level correcting 
section, and an input level of the level standard signal is 

changed to a recording level according to the level reference 
signal in a recording level standard signal generating section 

to generate a recording level standard signal. Also, 
peripheral horizontal scanning lines of the HD picture signal 

placed at peripheral portions of an image plane are deleted in 
a signal dividing section, and a TCI signal is generated. The 

recording level standard signal is interposed in the TCI 
signal to generate a composite signal, and the composite 

signal is recorded in a magnetic tape. The composite signal is 
reproduced and changed to another HD signal in which an output 

level standard signal including an output level reference 
signal and an output information signal are interposed in the 

particular horizontal scanning line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-definition 
picture signal recording apparatus for recording a high-definition 
picture signal of which an amplitude level is 
controlled, a high-definition picture signal reproducing 
apparatus for reproducing a high-definition picture signal of 
which an amplitude level is controlled, and a high-definition 
picture signal recording/reproducing apparatus for recording 
and reproducing a high-definition picture signal of which an 
amplitude level is controlled. A broad-band type of high-definition picture signal such 
as a high-vision signal (hereinafter, called a HD picture 
signal) and an extended definition television signal 
(hereinafter, called an EDTV signal) have been recently known. 
The number of horizontal scanning lines in a frame of picture  
 
image displayed with the high-definition picture signal is 
higher than that in a frame of picture image displayed with a 
conventional picture signal such as a national television 
system committee (NTSC) type of signal. In an apparatus 
utilizing the high-definition picture signal, the signal is 
digitized to perform various types of digital processing for a 
digital signal. Therefore, because a dynamic range of the 
digital signal is strictly limited to perform the digital 
processing, it is required to control an amplitude level of 
the high-definition picture signal. To control the amplitude level of high-definition picture 
signal in a conventional method, a synchronizing signal is 
synchronized with the high-definition picture signal, an 
amplitude level of the synchronizing signal is detected, and 
the amplitude level of the high-definition picture signal is 
controlled according to the amplitude level of the 
synchronizing signal. However, the high-definition picture 
signal is often processed according to various types of 
digital processing in an apparatus utilizing the high-definition 
picture signal while deleting a part of the high-definition 
picture signal transferred in vertical blanking 
periods and horizontal synchronizing signal periods to 
minimize a capacity of memories for storing the high-definition 
picture signal. Therefore, in cases where the 
amplitude level of the high-definition picture signal is  
 
corrected according to the amplitude level of the 
synchronizing signal, there is a drawback that the correction 
of the amplitude level is not accurate. To solve the drawback, a level standard signal adding 
apparatus in which a level standard signal is added to one of 
horizontal
