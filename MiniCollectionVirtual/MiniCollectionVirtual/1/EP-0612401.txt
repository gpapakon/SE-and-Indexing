<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to testing of pumps 
and in particular to determining the efficiency of 
water pumps, particularly water pumps for use with 
sumps. A known technique for measuring efficiency E of 
a water pump involves measuring the time T taken for 
a known volume V of water to be pumped by the pump, 
the power P, such as electrical power, supplied to the 
pump during this time and the pump output pressure p, 
i.e. the pumping head. The efficiency is then 
determined from the following equation: 
E(%) = V(m3)/T(s) x p (Nm-2)P(W)x 100% The electrical power can be measured either 
directly using a wattmeter or simply by measuring the 
current passing through the motor and multiplying this 
by the voltage applied to the pump and a further 
factor, √3 cos , where cos  is the motor power 
factor, typically 0.9. The main disadvantage of this method of measuring 
pump efficiency resides in the time taken to effect a 
measurement; indeed, it can take between one and two  
 
man-days to test a single pump in this manner, since, 
although the time taken for the water to be pumped 
between the two levels is typically at most a few 
hours, such a test must be repeated several times and 
the measurements averaged in order for the results to 
be meaningful. In accordance with a first aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a method of determining 
the pumping efficiency of a water pump which is 
powered for a time interval dependent on the flow rate 
through the pump, the method comprising: sensing the 
power applied to the pump and generating power data 
representative thereof; sensing the water pressure at 
the pump outlet and generating pressure data 
representative thereof; characterised by automatically 
storing said data at predetermined intervals for 
subsequent processing thereof during both said time 
interval for which the power is applied and a time 
interval for which the power is not applied, such that 
the flow rate and hence the pumping efficiency of the 
pump is derivable from said data during said 
subsequent processing. In accordance with a second aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a system for determining 
the pumping efficiency of a water pump which is 
powered during a time interval dependent on the flow 
rate through the pump the system comprising: a power 
sensor for sensing the power applied to the pump and 
means for generating power data representative  
 
thereof; a pressure sensor for sensing the water 
pressure at the pump outlet and means for
