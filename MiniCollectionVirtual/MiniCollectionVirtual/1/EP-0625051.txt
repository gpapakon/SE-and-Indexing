<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a complex comprising hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and met proto-oncogene protein. The present invention also relates to methods for detecting the presence of HGF ligand, met proto-oncogene receptor and methods for isolating either the ligand or receptor or complex comprising both. The present invention further relates to methods of diagnostic proliferative disorders and diseases such as hepatitis or hepatocarcinogenesis by detecting these ligand-receptor pairs.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HEPATIC GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTORThis is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/830,586 filed February 6, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of Serial No. 07/642,971 filed January 18, 1991, which is a continuation-in-part of Serial No. 07/457,556 filed December 27, 1989 and application Serial No. 07/582,063 filed September 14, 1990. The entire contents of all applications are hereby incorporated by reference.Technical fieldThe present invention relates to a complex comprising hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the met proto-oncogene protein. The present invention also relates to a method for detecting the presence of HGF ligand or met proto- oncogene receptor and to a method for isolating either the ligand, the receptor or a complex comprising both.The present invention further relates to methods of diagnosing and treating conditions proliferative disorders such as hepatitis, hepatocarcinogenesis, carcinogenesis and wound healing.Further, the present invention relates to a method of stimulating the proliferation of hemtopoietic progenitors with HGF.Background of the Invention Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was first purified from human and rabbit plasma and rat platelets on the basis of its ability to stimulate 

mitogenesis of rat hepatocytes (Gohoda et al. , Clin. Invest. 81, 414 (1988) ; Zarnegar et al. Cancer Res. 49, 3314 (1989) ; Nakamura et al. FEBS Lett. 224, 311 (1987)) . Thus, HGF may act as a humoral factor promoting liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy or liver injury (Michalopoulos FASEB J. 4, 176 (1990)) . The same factor was purified from human fibroblast culture medium and shown to act on melanocytes and a variety of epithelial and endothelial cells (Rubin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 88, 415 (1990)) . Together with evidence of HGF expression in several organs (Rubin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 415 (1990) ; Tashiro et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 3200 (1990) ; Zarnegar et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 1252 (1990) ; Kinoshita et al. Biochero. Biophys. Res. Conun. 165, 1229 (1989)), these findings indicate that HGF may also act as a paracrine mediator of proliferation for a broad spectrum of cell types. Molecular cloning of HGF revealed a remarkable structural homology to plasminogen and related serine proteases (Rubin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 415 (1990) ; Nakamura et al. Nature 342, 440 (1989) ; Miyazawa et al. Biophys. Res. Comm. 163, 967 (1989)) . Recent evidence that HGF induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in

2. A method of treating leukemia comprising administering to mammals a protein selected from the group consisting of, HGF, met protein receptor, and HGF- met protein receptor complex.
3. A method of stimulating the immune response in a mammal comprising administering to said mammal a protein consisting of HGF, met protein receptor, and HGF-met protein receptor complex.
4. Antibodies specific for a complex comprising an HGF ligand and met proto-oncogene receptor protein.
5. A composition suitable for use in inducing bone marrow regeneration, treating leukemia, or stimulating the immune response to infection comprising the antibodies according to claim 4, in an amount sufficient to effect said responses, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
6. A method of inhibiting bone marrow regeneration comprising administering to mammals a protein selected from the group consisting of HGF, met protein receptor, and HGF-met protein receptor complex.
