<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain
quinazoline compounds which demonstrate antiproliferative
activity, such as antitumor activity,
to pharmaceutical compositions
containing these compounds, and to the use of these compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for
inhibiting the growth and proliferation of the cells of
higher organisms and microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeasts
and fungi. Preferred compounds of the present invention are
capable of inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate synthase.
Effects derived from the inhibition of the enzyme thymidylate
synthase include those discussed above.A large class of antiproliferative agents includes
antimetabolite compounds. A particular subclass of
antimetabolites known as antifolates or antifols are
antagonists of the vitamin folic acid. Typically,
antifolates closely resemble the structure of folic acid and
incorporate the characteristic p-benzoyl glutamate moiety of
folic acid. The glutamate moiety of folic acid takes on a
double negative charge at physiological pH. Therefore, this
compound and its analogues have an active, energy-driven
transport system to cross the cell membrane and exert a
metabolic effect. On the other hand, a compound without the
glutamate group may passively diffuse into a cell.A valid target for an antifolate is the enzyme
thymidylate synthase. Thymidylate synthase catalyzes the C-methylation
of 2'-deoxyuridylate ("dUMP") to provide 2'-deoxythymidylate
("dTMP"). This one-carbon transfer reaction
is critical to cell division. Thus, a number of rotate
analogues have been synthesized and studied for their ability
to inhibit the enzyme thymidylate synthase. A prototypic,
specific, tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase,
10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (T. R. Jones et al., "A
Potent Antitumor Quinazoline Inhibitor of Thymidylate
Synthetase: Synthesis, Biological Properties and Therapeutic
Results in Mice," Eur. J. Cancer 17:11 (1981)), has shown 
activity against ovarian, liver and breast cancer, with,
however, troublesome hepatic and renal toxicities (A. H.
Calvert et al., "A Phase I Evaluation of the Quinazoline
Antifolate Thymidylate Synthase Inhibitor, N10-Propargyl-5,8-Dideazafolic
Acid, CB3717," J. Clin. Oncol. 4:1245 (1986)).
By addressing two properties in this class of molecule
(solubility and capability for intracellular
polyglutamation), a superior second generation analogue (ICI
D1694) was developed.Several lipophilic thymidylate synthase inhibitors
have been developed recently. (See, e.g., E. M. Berman et
al.,
