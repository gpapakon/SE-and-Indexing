<ABSTRACT>
A desired frame image can be searched for and 
reproduced at high speeds. The same holds true for 

frame return reproduction. A data unit containing the 
video info
rmation compressed by encoding is stored in a 
data unit memory (406) and decoded at a decoding unit. 

When the target frame is decoded, the decode output is 
stored in an image memory (405) and supplied as a still 

reproduction image via a switch (403). The image memory 
(405) can also be used as a memory for storing the 

decode output of the frame located at the mid-point 
between the start frame of the data unit and the frame 

currently being reproduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reproduction apparatus 
capable of recording and reproducing a program, such as 
a movie, on a recording medium, such as an optical disk 
or a CD-ROM, and more particularly to a reproduction 
apparatus with a search function capable of searching 
for a desired frame at a high speed. Since such recording mediums as magnetic disks or 
optical disks provide high-speed data access, though 
they have a smaller memory capacity than magnetic tape, 
they facilitate the reading, the transferring, and the 
head-locating of a program of moving-picture data. 
Recent advances in high-efficient coding technology for 
image data have made it possible to store many programs, 
and recording and reproduction systems using such disks 
as recording mediums will find their way into a wider 
variety of applications. Such moving-picture compression 
recording techniques include a system prescribed by 
ISO-11172 (MPEG). Such reproduction systems are also required to provide 
still reproduction, frame supply reproduction, and 
frame return reproduction. With the image data recorded 
by high-efficient coding techniques, when these functions 
are carried out, it is impossible to access and 
reproduce a desired frame directly. Because of this, it 
would take time to get the desired frame. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is  
 
to provide a reproduction apparatus with a search function 
capable of searching for a desired frame at a high 
speed. The foregoing object is accomplished by providing a 
reproduction apparatus for a disk in which a management 
area is formed in a portion thereof and a data area is 
formed in another portion thereof, programs being 
recorded in the data area, each of the programs being 
composed of a plurality of data units, each of the data 
units containing a specified number of frames of video 
information each compressed by frame correlation, and 
information on the start addresses of the plurality of 
data units being stored in the management area, the 
reproduction apparatus comprising: pickup means for 
reading the information from the disk; demodulation 
means for demodulating the output signal of the pickup 
means; management information storage means for storing 
each piece of management information in the management 
area outputted from the demodulation means; a data unit 
memory for storing the data units outputted from the 
demodulation means; video decode means for decoding 
video information on the data units outputted from the 
demodulation means;
