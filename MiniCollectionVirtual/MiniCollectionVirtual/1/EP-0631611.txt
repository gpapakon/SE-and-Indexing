<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to carboxylic acid based cleansing
bars.Neutral pH bars, per se, are known. Prior art neutral pH
bars do not include substantial levels of hygroscopic materials,
soft solids, and liquids, including water, without becoming soft
or sticky with poor smears. Firm, low smear, neutral pH cleansing
bars as defined herein, are believed to be novel and unexpectedly
firm with good smear.US-A-3,557,006, Ferrara et al., issued Jan. 19,
1971, discloses a composite soap bar having an acid pH in use.
Other background references are: GB-A-513,696,
Mangeot, accepted Oct. 19, 1939; JP-A-54-151410,
filed Nov. 21, 1979, and published June 6, 1985; and
US-A-4,606,839 Harding, issued Aug. 19, 1986.Some commercial neutral pH bars are: DOVE® (TN), CARESS® (TN), and
OLAY® (TN).US-A-2,988,511, Mills, issued June 13, 1961,
discloses a low smearing bar.Bar smear, also referred to as bar sloth, is the soft solid
or mush that forms at the surface of a bar when submerged in water
and is regarded by consumers as messy, unattractive, and uneconomical.However, an examination of a used personal cleansing bars in
today's average bathroom will show that there Is still a need to
improve cleansing bar smear.Bar smear is especially poor in neutral pH bar formulations
which contain higher levels (50% ±10%) of synthetic surfactant. The formation of rigid, soap curd fibers of sodium laurate is
reported by L. Marton at al. in a 1940 Journal of American Chemical
Society (Vol. 63, pp. 1990-1993).
JP-A-J5 7030-798, July 30, 1980, discloses transparent
solid framed or molded soap bar.It is an object of the present invention to produce a firm,
mild, neutral pH, low smear cleansing bar that contains relatively
high level of moisture in the presence of a synthetic surfactant
and soft solids, such as water-soluble polyols and hydrocarbon
greases.The present invention provides a firm, ultra mild, neutral pH cleansing bar comprising:
a) from 15% to 35% by weight of monocarboxylic acid having the general
formula:

wherein: a + b = 10 to 20; each a, b = 0 to 20; X = H, OR, OC(O)R1, R or
mixtures thereof; R= C1 - C3 alkyl, H, or mixtures thereof; R1 = C1 alkyl:
wherein from 20% to 65% by weight of said monocarboxylic acid is
neutralised and is in the form of a sodium salt and wherein from 35% to
80% by weight of said monocarboxylic acid is free monocarboxylic acid:(b) from 15% to 65% by weight of a water-soluble organic anionic and/or
nonionic bar firmness aid: wherein said bar firmness aid comprises from
10% to 40% by weight synthetic
