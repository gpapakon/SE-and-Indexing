<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an auctioning system which 
comprises at least a price display unit (3), an 

auctioneer's operator station (2), two buyer's operator 
stations (1) and a data processing unit (10), of which at 

least a number are linked by at least one communication 
network (12). The mutual communication between one or more 

of the above-mentioned components is effected by means of 
electronic messages which comprise at least sender and 

destination information. The data processing unit (10) is 
at least designed for monitoring the auctioning process and 

for knocking down a sold lot to a buyer, which is done on 
the basis of a knocking-down algorithm which makes use of 

one or more criteria such as sequential order within a 
certain time window, account possibly being taken of the 

signal propagation delay, level of each bid and/or possible 
priority for certain buyers, while the data processing unit 

(10) is moreover designed for the further settling of the 
purchase via a bilateral link set up between the data 

processing unit (10) and the or each buyer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an auctioning system which 
comprises at least the following elements: a price display 
unit, an auctioneer's operator station, two buyer's 
operator stations and a data processing unit, at least a 
number of elements being linked by at least a first 
communication network, the communication between one or 
more elements being effected by means of electronic 
messages which comprise at least sender and destination 
information, the auctioneer's operator station being 
designed at least for activating a price display unit in 
order to set an initial sale price, and for resetting the 
price display unit after an auction session has finished, 
each buyer's operator station being designed at least for 
acting on the price display unit, a data processing unit 
being at least provided with a memory unit and being 
designed at least for monitoring the auctioning process, 
for recording buyers participating in an auction, and for 
recording a definitive sale price, a lot size of sold 
goods, together with the buyer to which the said sold lot 
has been knocked down. Such auctioning systems are known in practice. The 
known auctioning systems generally are limited in that they 
have been designed for only one auction type, for example 
either for sale by Dutch auction or for bid-up auctioning. 
The goods to be sold are knocked down, in the case of a 
Dutch auction, to the buyer who is the first to stop an 
auction clock decreasing in price, while, in general, in an 
auction of the bid-up type the goods to be sold are sold to 
the highest bidder. The object of the invention is to overcome the 
above-described limitation by providing an improved 
auctioning system which is being characterized in that the 
data processing unit is also designed for performing the 
knocking down on the basis of a knocking-down algorithm 
which makes use of one or more criteria such as sequential 
order within a certain time window, account being taken 
optionally of the signal propagation delay, level of each  
 
bid, possible priority for certain buyers, reopening of the 
bidding in the case of an incomplete bid; and in that the 
data processing unit is designed for the further settling 
of the purchase via a bilateral link set up between the 
data processing unit and the or each buyer. Auctioning systems according to the invention are 
advantageous over prior art auctioning systems in that 
flexible, multifunctional auctioning systems are being 
obtained, which can easily be adapted, e.g. in terms of 
knockin

<CLAIMS>
Auctioning system, at least comprising the 
following elements: a price display unit (3), an 

auctioneer's operator station (2), two buyer's operator 
stations (1) and a data processing unit (10), at least a 

number of elements (1, 2, 3, 10) being linked by at least a 
first communication network, the communication between one 

or more elements (1, 2, 3, 10) being effected by means of 
electronic messages which comprise at least sender and 

destination information, the auctioneer's operator station 
(2) being designed at least for activating a price display 

unit (3) in order to set an initial sale price, and for 
resetting the price display unit (3) after an auction 

session has finished, each buyer's operator station (1) 
being designed at least for acting on the price display 

unit (3), a data processing unit (10) being at least 
provided with a memory unit and being designed at least for 

recording buyers participating in an auction, and for 
recording a definitive sale price, a lot size of sold 

goods, together with the buyer to which the said sold lot 
has been knocked down, characterized in that the data 

processing unit (10) is also designed for performing the 
knocking down on the basis of a knocking-down algorithm 

which makes use of one or more criteria such as sequential 
order within a certain time window, account being taken 

optionally of the signal propagation delay, level of each 
bid, possible priority for certain buyers, reopening of the 

bidding in the case of an incomplete bid; and in that the 
data processing unit (10) is designed for the further 

settling of the purchase via a bilateral link set up 
between the data processing unit (10) and the or each 

buyer. 
System according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the data processing unit (10) is designed for initializing 

the system, prior to a sale process, by loading software 
specific to the sale process in question. 
System according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the software has incorporated therein one or more criteria. 
System according to any one of Claims 1-3, 
characterized in that an auctioneer's operator station (2) 

is designed for modifying or appending one or more 
criteria, prior to an auction session. 
System according to any one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized in that a buyer's operator station (1) is 

designed for modifying or appending one or more buyer-specific

device (13) is designed in such a way that it cyclically 
polls the first subnetworks (12) for messages, carries
