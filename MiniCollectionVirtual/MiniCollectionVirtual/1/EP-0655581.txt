<ABSTRACT>
The oxyfuel burner comprises at least one first tubular member (2) which conveys the oxidant and at least one second tubular member (3) for injecting the fuel into the flow of oxidant, arranged asymmetrically in relation to the first (2), so that the mixing zone upstream of the flame comprises a part where the ratio of the oxidant to the fuel is smaller than the stoichiometric value.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the combustion of a fuel and of an
oxidizer, in which the fuel is injected asymmetrically

into the stream of oxidizer, in that the stream of
oxidizer comprises from 85% to 100% oxygen so as to

create a mixing zone upstream of the flame which has a
part where the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio is less than the

stoichiometric value, thus locally creating a reducing
atmosphere.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the oxidizer comprises more than 90% oxygen.
