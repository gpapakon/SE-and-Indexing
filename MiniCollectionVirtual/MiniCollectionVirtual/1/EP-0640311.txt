<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for packaging, transporting and dispensing controlled doses of granular or powdery goods, in particular a food product. A changeable container (1) of relatively large volume and capable of being closed gastightly and a portioning device (2) can be connected to each other by coupling elements (13) constructed, on one side, at an opening of the changeable container (1) and, on the other side, at an opening of the portioning device (2), the portioning device (2) having electric control means for the dosed dispensing of goods. Both the changeable container and the portioning device with its actuating means (3) can be used as often as desired. A coding, e.g. a magnetic strip card (7), can be assigned to the changeable container, cooperating with scanning elements (8), provided in the circuit of the portioning device, to enable the electric control system.

Apparatus for packaging, for transporting and for
dispensing in measured quantities a granular or

pulverulent substance, in particular a foodstuff, characterized
by an interchangeable container (1) of relatively

large volume which can be closed in a gas-tight manner
and is intended for transporting the substance, and by an

apportioning device (2), the two of these having complementary
coupling elements (13), one at an opening of the

interchangeable container (1) and the other on the
filling side of the apportioning device (2), for

interconnection purposes, and by electric control means
for connecting up the apportioning device (2) for dispensing

the substance in measured quantities.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in
that means (7) for releasing the electric control means

of the apportioning device are provided on the interchangeable
container (1).
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in
that a coded magnetic strip card (7) is arranged on the

interchangeable container (1), and the electric circuit
of the apportioning device (2) has elements (8) for

sensing the coding of the magnetic strip card (7).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or a number of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the interchangeable

container (1) consists of high-grade stainless steel and
has an opening in a neck-like extension (6), it being

possible for said opening to be closed in a gas-tight
manner by an aluminium foil and in a mechanical manner by

an inverted-rim cover (5).
Apparatus according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the coded magnetic strip card (7) is connected

releasably to the aluminium foil, which closes the
opening of the interchangeable container (1) in a gas-tight

manner.
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the apportioning device (2) comprises a valve, a

sluice or a mechanical conveying device.
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that the apportioning device (2)

comprises a conveying worm (12) which is driven in
rotation and of which the electric drive (4) has a

controllable circuit.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the controllable circuit has a switching element

which is interrupted by the weight of the quantity of
substance dispensed, by a clock or by comparable means.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the apportioning device (2) can be

coupled to a housing of an equipment base (3), said
housing receiving the drive means and the control

elements.
