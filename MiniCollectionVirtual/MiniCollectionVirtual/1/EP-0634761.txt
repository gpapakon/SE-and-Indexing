Amethod for producing a solid electrolytic apacitor comprising the steps of preparing 
a valve metal plate, forming an oxide film layer on the valve metal plate, dividing 

the surface of the valve metal plate into a negative electrode section and a positive 
electrode section by an insulating layer, forming a conductive laminate including a 

conductive material coated layer, a conductive macromolecules layer, a graphite 
layer, and a silver paint layer in the negative electrode section so as to form a 

capacitor element, laminating a plurality of the capacitor elements wherein the 
negative electrode section is connected to a conductive frame, and connecting the 

positive electrode section to another portion of the frame, bending a top end of another 
portion of the frame at 180° until the bent portion pinches the positive 

electrode sections kep in contact with each other, welding the frame to the capacitor 
elements by laser, and encasing the capacitor elements and part of the frame in a 

casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of a solid 
electrolytic capacitor using conductive macromolecules 
as solid electrolyte, and more particularly, of a solid 
electrolytic capacitor which is encased in synthetic 
resin molded casing, hereinafter referred to as the 
"casing". In line with the recent trend in which electronic 
circuits are digitized and have high frequencies, 
capacitors used therefor are required to have 
high reliability, small-size, large capacitance and 
excellent high frequency characteristics. Solid electrolytic 
capacitors, which are inherently small-size 
and have large capacitance, have been improved by 
using solid electrolytes of newly developed conductive 
macromolecules. As a result, they have a high electro-conductivity 
of conductive macromolecules of about 
104 s/m as compared with that of manganese dioxide 
(100 s/m or TCNQ salt (102 s/m) and high thermal stability. 
The improved solid electrolyte capacitors have 
desirable characteristics such as stable frequency 
characteristics of impedance and thermal characteristics 
within a wide range. However, it is necessary to reduce inductance 
caused by external terminals of the capacitor in accordance 
with increases in frequency. It is also  
 
required to occupy a minimum space on a circuit substrate 
in order to reduce the size of the electronic 
devices. Furthermore, the consistent reliability of 
capacitors are essential so as not to spoil the sophisticate, 
long-term electronic devices. Therefore, chip 
type elements which are small-size, highly reliable, 
and flexible in mounting, that is, can be mounted in a 
desired position without occupying a large space; that 
is, vertically stacked or horizontally arranged. 
Conventional elements are disadvantageous in that 
inductance is likely to become large and mounting 
flexibility is lacking. Referring to Figures 11 and 12, a conventional 
chip type solid electrolytic capacitor will be 
described: The solid electrolyte capacitor uses conductive 
macromolecules as solid electrolyte. The type 
shown in Figure 11(a) is covered with positive electrode 
foils, and the type shown in Figure 11(b) is 
provided with plain positive electrode foils, and 
Figure 12 shows a further type of low chip solid electrolyte 
capacitor element. The positive foils are 
etched to form an oxide film as dielectric. Then a 
conductive macromolecules layer, a graphite layer, and 
a silver paint layer are formed on the portion except 
the lead line of the positive electrode. A positive
