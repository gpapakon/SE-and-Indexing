<ABSTRACT>
A device for heating a folding target (hinged target, collapsible target) for shooting ranges having a pivoting shaft (axis) (1.1) which is arranged in the plane of the target on or under the lower edge of the target (1) and about which the target (1) can be folded down from a vertical position to a horizontal position. The heating is carried out by means of an inflatable heating cushion (3) of predetermined size and external contour, consisting of two webs which are connected to one another at least at their outer edges in an airtight manner and consist of flexible material which is impermeable to air and has at least one gas outlet opening (4), and by means of a gas inlet (5) which is connected via a hose link (6) to a source (7) for a heated gas. The heating cushion (3) is inflated with the heated gas, and the target (1) is folded down for heating so that it rests on the heating cushion (3).

Method of heating a hinged target board (1) for practice 
firing ranges, said hinged target board (1) by means of a 

swivelling axis (1.1) disposed in the plane of the board 
at or below the bottom edge of the board being folded 

down out of a vertical position into a horizontal 
position in such a way as to be applied onto an 

inflatable heating mattress (3) of a predetermined size 
and external contour which is disposed on the ground, 

wherein the heating mattress (3) comprises two webs (3.1, 
3.2) of flexible, air-impermeable material, which are 

connected in an air-tight manner to one another at least 
at their outer edges, and at least one gas outlet opening 

(4, 4.1) and a gas inlet (5, 5.1), which is connected by 
a hose connection (6) to a heated gas source (7). 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
heating mattress (3) at its outer edges comprises 

fastening devices (8-9, 8.1-8.4) for fastening to the 
ground. 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
fastening devices at the outer edges comprise through-openings 

(8.1-8.4), which are sealed off from the 
interior of the heating mattress (3) and through which 

earth nails are insertable. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the webs (3.1, 3.2) between their outer edges are 

additionally connected to one another at predetermined 
points. 
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
additional connection is effected by means of rivets (10) 

which penetrate both webs.  
 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that a plurality of air outlet openings (4.1) are 

disposed at predetermined intervals in the top surface of 
the heating mattress (3). 
Method according to claims 5 and 6, characterized in that 
the air outlet openings (4.1) lie at predetermined 

intervals on lines running through the fastening points 
(10) between the outer edges. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the webs (3.1, 3.2) forming the heating mattress 

(3) are made of a polyamide-coated woven polyester 
fabric. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that, as a heated gas source, a warm air heater (7) is 

used, which comprises a heating device operable by a 
liquid fuel, a heat exchanger, a feed device for heated 

air, as well as a battery-operated electric control 
device.
