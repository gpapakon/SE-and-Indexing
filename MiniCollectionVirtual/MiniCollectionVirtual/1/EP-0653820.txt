<ABSTRACT>
An adapter cable and card for interfacing a personal 
computer to a local area network or other type of computer 

network which can operate on either of two types of media. 
The cable uses a symmetrical plug connector which mates with 

a receptacle connector on the adapter card in either a first 
position, or a second position which is 180 degrees rotated 

from the first position. In the first position, signal 
lines for one type of media are connected and signal lines 

for the other type of media are disconnected. In the second 
position, signal lines for the second type of media are 

connected, and signal lines for the first type are disconnected. 
The disconnection of the unused conductors allows 

the drive circuits for unused type of media to remain active 
without causing electromagnetic interference problems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the way a personal computer is
interfaced to shared local area network (LAN) wiring such as
might be installed in an office building. It is
particularly useful with portable and laptop computers.Currently, the personal computer user connects his or her
computer to the LAN by installing in the computer a LAN
adapter card which includes a "pin-and-socket" input/output
(I/O) receptacle connector and subsequently connecting
between this receptacle connector and the LAN wiring an
adapter cable assembly. The adapter cable has on one end, a
pin-and-socket plug connector which mates with the
receptacle connector on the adapter card, and on the other
end a connector which plugs into a wall plate socket which
is in turn connected to the LAN wiring installed in the
building. The personal computer can be moved from room to
room if necessary by simply unplugging the adapter cable,
and plugging it in in a different room.The above scheme becomes more complicated if the user wants
to move his or her computer from building to building and
the LAN of choice can be operated on two or more different
kinds of wiring with different impedance characteristics and
wall connectors. For example, the token ring local area
network can be operated on shielded twisted pair media or
unshielded twisted pair media. Each type of media requires
its own drive and receive circuits on the adapter card
because each has different impedance and drive
characteristics. Users of small notebook or laptop personal
computers which are equipped to connect to the token ring
LAN are likely to encounter both kinds of wiring as they go 
to meetings in different buildings, possibly in different
geographic areas or even different countries. In the
current art, such users are accommodated in one of two ways.In one scheme, drive circuits for both types of media are
kept active and brought out to pins or sockets of the
receptacle connector of the adapter card. The user is
supplied with two adapter cables. On one the appropriate
network wall plug is wired to the appropriate pins or
sockets on the plug connector to connect to one type of
media; on the other the second type of network wall plug is
wired to the appropriate pins or sockets on the plug
connector for the other media. The user simply switches
adapter cables to switch between different types of LAN
media. This scheme works, but the user has to carry two
adapter cables. Additionally, the supplier of the LAN
adapter card for the personal computer has the added cost of
supplying
