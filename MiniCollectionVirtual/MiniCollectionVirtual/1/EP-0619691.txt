<CLAIMS>
Glazing provided with at least one electrical connection element, which electrical connection element comprises a first conductive part (14) and a second conductive part, the first conductive part being, on the one hand, connected and in electrical contact with electrical conductors in the glazing and, on the other hand, being intended for connection to said second conductive part, which second conductive part is constituted by a first conductive end (17) for connection to the first conductive part (14) and a second conductive end connected to a power supply, said first conductive part (14) and said first conductive end (17) being in a connected position and projecting from the glazing, 
characterized in that
 the glazing is also provided with an encapsulation (21), the constituent material of which fits the shape of the first conductive part (14) and the first conductive end (17) by being moulded directly onto the glazing, the moulding being compact and occupying a bounded space which is defined by an area of contact with glazing necessary for contributing to the fastening of the connection element.
Glazing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the material constituting the encapsulation (21) is chosen from among the following materials: silicone, single-component or two-component polyurethane or a material which is fluid when hot and solid when cold.
Glazing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said first conductive part (14) and said first conductive end (17) which are to be connected are in particular a coupling ring (14) and an e.g. male lug (17).
Glazing according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the electrical conductors in the Blazing constitute a heating system (4, 5).
