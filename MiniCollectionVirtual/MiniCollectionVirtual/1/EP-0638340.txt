A supporting device for a golf bag (1), having a pair of
support legs (4) hinged to said golf bag and pivotable from a

position approximately parallel to the longitudinal axis of
said golf bag (1) towards an oblique position with respect to

the longitudinal axis of said golf bag (1), said pair of
support legs (4) being hinged to an annular rigid support (2)

which constitutes part of Said golf bag (1) and being charged
in one circumferential direction of said support (2) by at

least one resilient element (5),
characterized
 in that the support legs (4) are
connected to a pull cord (6) in the opposite circumferential

direction of said support (2), said pull cord being connected
to a strap (7) hinged to said support (2) and forming a snap

means pivotable towards two positions, wherein, in one position
of said strap (7), said support legs (4) are pulled towards the

abutting position at said golf bag (1) against the direction of
the applied force of said resilient element (5), and, in the

other pivoting position of said strap (7), said support legs
(4) are released.
A device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that a shoulder strap (3) is
fixed with its upper end to the receptacle (1) such that in the

support position of said support legs (4) the fixing position
of said shoulder strap (3) is located underneath said strap (7)

and, when lifting said receptacle by means of said shoulder
strap (3), said strap (7) is pivoted away by said shoulder

strap (3).
A device as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that said strap (7) is hinged to
said support (2) by means of a substantially ring-shaped 

bracket (9), said shoulder strap (3) being fixed at the
perimeter thereof such that, when lifting said strap (3), said

bracket (9) stresses said strap (7).
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that said support legs (4) have
their ends (10) angularly bent towards the inside, said ends

(10) being inserted in pocket bore holes of a bearing link (11)
mounted in said support (2).
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the articulated axles of
said support legs (4) extend at an angle with respect to the

diameter line of said support (2) which diameter line
constitutes the median line between opposite hinge points of

said support legs.
A device as claimed in claim 5,
characterized
 in that the articulated axles of
said support legs (4) extend at an angle with respect to the

receptacle axis, said articulated axles forming an angle
greater than 90Â° with respect to the longitudinal axis of said

support legs (4).
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that a drag strut (13) is
inserted in the approximately annular support (2) along the

direction of the line of application of said strap ribbon (3).
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that a stiffening rib (14)
extending along the receptacle wall approximately parallel to

said receptacle axis is fixed to said support (2).
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that said resilient means for
stressing said support legs (4) is formed by a rubber band (5). 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that said pull cord (6) is
inserted in a groove (15) of said strap (7) and said support

legs (4) are removably hinged to said support (2).
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that said support (2) is provided
with means for securing a receptacle (1) to said support (2).
