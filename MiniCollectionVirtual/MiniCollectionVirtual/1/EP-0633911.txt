<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a polyester/polyamide
blend having an excellent gas barrier property and an
improved flavor retaining property, and clarity. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a
polyethylene terephthalate/low molecular weight
polyamide blend having an excellent gas barrier
property, in which by reducing the concentration of
acetaldehyde contained in the polyester, the storage
property of a food or the like and the flavor-retaining
property and fragrance retaining property are highly
improved without producing haze.Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is widely used for
the production of light weight plastic articles since
PET is excellent in mechanical properties such as
formability and creep resistance and can be biaxially
molecularly oriented. However, during molding or
extrusion processes, acetaldehyde is formed by thermal
decomposition of the polyester and when the polyester is
formed into an article, the acetaldehyde in the article
walls migrates into the contents of the article. Small
amounts of acetaldehyde adversely affect the flavor
retaining property of foods and beverages, and the
fragrance retaining property of foods, beverages,
cosmetics, and other package contents. For these
reasons, it is desirable to minimize the migration of
acetaldehyde into package contents. Thermoplastic polyesters excellent in gas barrier
properties have been proposed. For example, U.S. Pat.
No. 4,398,017 discloses a copolyester containing
terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid as the acid
component, and ethylene glycol and bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)
benzene as the diol component. However, when such gas
barrier polyester is used as a constituent material of a
container, permeation of gases such as oxygen and carbon
dioxide are controlled, but acetaldehyde migration into
the food or beverage is not controlled, and thus, the
flavor and fragrance of the content is affected.The use of polyamides to increase the gas barrier
properties in polyethylene terephthalate resins is
disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,837,115, 4,052,481 and
4,501,781.U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,115 discloses a thermoplastic
composition containing polyethylene terephthalate and
high molecular weight polyamides which act to reduce the
residual acetaldehyde contained in the polyester. U.S.
Pat No. 4,837,115 states that the molecular weight of
the polyamide is not critical so far as the polyamide
has a film-forming property. Such polyamides,
therefore, must have high enough molecular weights to
form a film. It is well known in the art that
polyamid
