<ABSTRACT>
Shearing blades are attached to a lower jaw and an upper 
jaw which are arranged to be opened and closed in a crossing 

manner. The lower leading blade 24 and the lower trailing blade 
25, both attached to the lower jaw 4, are arranged to form a 

substantially V-shaped configuration and in a staggered fashion 
with respect to the shearing plane. The upper leading blade 30 

and the upper trailing blade, both attached to the upper jaw 5, 
are arranged to form a substantially inverted V-shaped 

configuration and in a staggered fashion with respect to the 
shearing plane. At least one offset 26 and at least one gap 27 

are provided between the lower leading blade 24 and the lower 
trailing blade 25, while at least one offset 32 and at least one 

gap 33 are provided between the upper leading blade 30 and the 
upper trailing blade 31.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shearing machine mounted on a
tip of an arm of a working machine, such as a power shovel, for
shearing a various kinds of steel material
(see for example US-A-5 187 868).When de-constructing or destroying reinforcing bars,
buildings of a reinforced concrete construction, scraps of steel
article or chemical machinery of steel alloy, a power shovel 1
shown in Fig. 11
has been proposed.
The power shovel includes an arm 2
mounted with a steel material shearing machine 3 at the tip end
thereof. Such a conventional steel material shearing machine 3
includes a lower jaw 4 and an upper jaw 5. The upper jaw 5 is
pivotably connected at the root portion thereof to the rearward
portion of the lower jaw 4 by means of a support shaft 6. The
upper jaw 5 and the lower jaw 4 are adapted to be opened and
closed, in a scissors-like manner, relative to one another by
means of a hydraulic cylinder disposed between a frame 7
extending from the lower jaw 4 and the upper jaw 5. The lower
jaw 4 and the upper jaw 5 include their respective shearing
blades 11, 12 attached to their respective inner surfaces adapted
to be slidably engaged with each other. The lower shearing blade
11 attached to the lower jaw 4 and the upper shearing blade 12
attached to the upper jaw 5 are bent at their respective mid 
points 9 outwardly in the open-close direction of the jaws.The steel material shearing machine 3 shears or cuts a
steel material 13 clamped between the lower jaw 4 and the upper
jaw 5 when the jaws are moved relative one another in a crossing
manner. That is to say, the shearing blades 11, 12 attached to
the lower and upper jaws, respectively, serve to shear the steel
material 13 in both forward and rearward directions, while
preventing slippage of the steel material 13 by reason of the
outwardly displaced mid points 9.With the steel material shearing machine 3 having the
above construction, the rearward blade portion positioned
rearwardly of the mid point 9 of each of the lower shearing blade
11 and the upper shearing blade 12 has an angle smaller than that
of the forward blade portion. Thus, a cross-angle defined
between the steel material and the lower and upper shearing
blades 11, 12 becomes smaller as a shearing point of the steel
material approaches the respective mid points 9, so that shearing
ability is reduced at a position adjacent to the mid points 9.It is also noted that the lower jaw 4 and the upper jaw 5
tend to move away from one another by reason of a force component
of the shearing force
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A steel material shearing machine comprising a lower
jaw (4) and an upper jaw (5) adapted to be opened and

closed in a crossing manner with each other, and a lower
shearing blade (24, 25) and an upper shearing blade (30,

31) attached to said lower and upper jaws (4, 5)
respectively, each of said shearing blades being angled,

at a mid point along the longitudinal direction of said
blades, outwardly in the open-close direction of said

jaws (4, 5), each of said blades being arranged in a
staggered fashion so that the forward portion (24, 30)

forward of said mid point and the rearward portion (25,
31) rearward of said mid point of each of said blades are

disposed in opposite sides of a shearing plane between
said lower and upper shearing blades characterized in

that: each portion of said blades (25, 31) rearward of
said mid point is further angled outwardly in the open-close

direction so as to form an offset (26, 32) at a
position adjacent to said mid point.
A steel material shearing machine in accordance with
claim 2, characterised in that one of said blades (31) is

formed with a gap (33) at a position rearward of said mid
point, while the other of said blades is formed with a

gap (27) at a position forward of said mid point.
