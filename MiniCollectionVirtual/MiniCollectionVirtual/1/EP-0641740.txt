<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing crystalline
perovskite, Ax(BO3)y, ceramic powders consisting of submicron
or nanosized dispersible primary particles of narrow
size distributions and uniform, essentially spherical morphology.
The powders may contain other secondary ingredients,
such as dopants that alter electric properties, on the A and/or
B sites. The A cation is selected from the group consisting of
lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium,
and lanthanum; and B in BO3 is selected from the group
consisting of titanium in the oxidation state 4, zirconium in
the oxidation state 4, niobium in the oxidation state 5, tantalum
in the oxidation state 5, tin in the oxidation state 4,
and hafnium in the oxidation state 4. The powders may also contain
other additives, such as binders, to enhance their sinterability
and other properties. The powders have great usefulness
in many applications including dielectric, piezoelectric,
electrooptic, thermal sensors, and other ceramic industries. The perovskite typified by BaTiO3 has a cubic structure
when treated above 135°C. Its lattice consists of a regular
array of oxygen ions at the corners, a small tetravalent
titanium ion in the center, and big divalent barium ions
located at the face centers. The perovskite structure is
distorted at low temperatures, where it exhibits tetragonal,
orthorhombic, or rhombohedral symmetry. The transition temperature
at which the crystal structure transforms from the
distorted phase to the cubic phase is called the Curie temperature.
Ferroelectric behaviour is caused by the shift in
the position of the central cation, i.e., Ti ion in BaTiO3,
which results in a displacement of the centers of positive
and negative charges within the lattice and generates a
spontaneous polarization. The electric properties of perovskites
are significantly affected by this ferroelectric behaviour
which contributes to useful dielectric, piezoelectric,
and electrooptic properties.In recent years, electronic devices have become much
smaller in size and higher in performance than ever before.
This trend is also true in ferroelectric ceramics produced
from the perovskite compounds. Intensive investigations have
been made to improve the process for producing dielectric 
ceramics, such as molding and sintering methods. However, it
seems necessary to improve the properties of the starting
powders of perovskite compounds, in addition to the processes
for the production of ceramic dielectrics, in order to
obtain
