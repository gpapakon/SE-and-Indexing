<ABSTRACT>
Improved wet feed hopper for pigs which is made from a lower 
body (1) one-piece integrally constructed and comprising additionally 

a ramp (17) for the product or feed to be used to fall down, 
to which ramp (17) is fitted an adjustable metering device (12,13,14,15) 

with 
a rod (5). This metering device (12,13,14,15) is able to supply 

the most estrictly 
necessary quantity of product into the bowl (3) by moving 

a retractable metering hatch (12) which is being bumped by the 
pig. This hopper receives upwardly successive central bodies 

which with the seals (7) are tightly hermetically joined in an 
alternative way, the hopper volume can thus be increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present patent application relates to 
an improved wet feed hopper for pigs, having remarkable 
advantages and innovations compared with the prior art 
feed hoppers used for similar or equal purposes. This improved wet feed hopper for pigs is 
characterized in that it has a highly constructive 
simplicity meaning that sharpless-edged blunt bodies and a 
pressurized practical engagement system allowing to add 
successive upper bodies on the hopper can be used, the 
hopper volume can thus be increased and this type of 
hopper having also a witty metering device of the product 
or feed to be supplied, the device assuring consequently a 
remarkable feed use-cutting. All these characteristics and 
still further other ones are exhaustively described 
hereinafter as related to a practical but non-exhaustive 
representative embodiment of the present invention. To achieve a more detailed description of the 
present invention, reference will be made in the 
description of the attached figures, wherein a preferred 
way of embodiment by way of a non-exhaustive example has 
been illustrated. In the drawings: Figure 1 shows respective plan, elevation and 
profiled dihedric views of the feed hopper of the present 
invention. Figure 2 pertains to the previous elevation and 
profiled views, partly cross-sectioned to show the  
 
metering device and the receptive bowl or plate of the 
product to be eaten. Figure 3 shows a detail of the assembly of the 
successive bodies defining hopper variable volume. Returning to the figures, it can be seen in the 
illustrated embodiment, an improved wet feed hopper for 
pigs of the type shown, the hopper being made from a lower 
body 1 provided with a ramp 17 for the product or feed 
falling into receptive bowl or plate 3 with access thereto 
by the window 4. This lower body 1 is an integrally 
one-piece component; both the ramp 17 wherein the metering 
device is fastened and also the product or feed receptive 
bowl or plate 3, as shown in figure 2, because of being an 
one-piece component system prevent all kind of assemblies 
and have a limitless life. Also the product or feed receptive bowl or plate 3 
do not have corners nor sharp edges which might retain or 
accumulate feed wastes or other components, a complete 
advantage of the supplied product is thereby taken. On this body 1 successive central bodies 2 through 
assembly seals 7 (figure 3) are being fitted. The assembly 
of said central bodies 2 is simple enough, since by only 
pressing one against the other, they remain
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
1.- Improved wet feed hopper for pigs of the type 
comprising a prismatic body provided with a water supply 

11 so that the product or feed located into a lower bowl 3 
accessible from a window 4 can be wetted, essentially 

characterized in that it is made from a lower body 1 
one-piece integrally constructed and comprising 

additionally a ramp 17 for the product or feed to be used 
to fall down, to which ramp is fitted an adjustable 

metering device 12-13-14-15 with a rod 5, being able said 
metering device to supply the most strictly necessary 

quantity of product into the bowl 3 by moving a 
retractable metering hatch 12 which is being bumped by the 

pig; said hopper upwardly receiving successive central 
bodies 2 which with the seals 7 are tightly hermetically 

joined in an alternative way, the hopper volume can thus 
be increased. 
2.- Feed hopper, according to the previous claim, 
characterized in that the metering device comprises said 

hatch 12 which on being bumped by the pig rotates around a 
shaft 13, pushing by its upper end the product which has 

fallen over a retaining support 14 from said ramp 17 and 
being supplied by a curved sheet steel 15 operating as a 

guide for the product. 
3.- Feed hopper, according to claims 1 and 2. 
characterized in that the rod 5 adjusting the feed supply 

is registered in a flatbar 8 with its position being fixed 
for instance by a wing-nut system 6, the product supply 

 
hatch being adjusted with a lower stop 9 bearing on the 

support. 
4.- Feed hopper, according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the bodies 1 and 2 are having 

alongside in the rear portion a flat area 10 providing a 
perfect seat for the hopper on the walls or columns, 

protecting the hopper from repeated blows caused by 
clashes of pigs themselves against said metering hatch 12.
