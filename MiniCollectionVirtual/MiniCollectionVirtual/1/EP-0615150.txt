<ABSTRACT>
An integral cover glass for an LCD panel having an 
array of microlenses integral with the outside of its front 

face, whereby light is focused by each microlens to enhance 
light output from the panel. The microlens array may be a 

pattern of diffractive gratings; an array of spherical 
shaped surfaces developed on a glass substrate; or an array 

of microlenses formed by ion exchange in a glass to provide 
a gradient refractive index in the glass.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cover glass for a liquid 
crystal display (LCD) panel embodying an array of 
microlenses, of particular use in TV applications. Lens arrays, composed of a pattern of lenses formed on 
a surface of a substrate, are well known. An early 
technique for forming such an array involved forming a 
spherical surface on one end of each of a plurality of 
rods. The rods were then combined as by bundling and 
fusion sealing. More refined and versatile procedures are disclosed in 
United States Patents 4,572,611 and 4,952,026. Microlens arrays may also be made by developing a 
gradient refractive index (GRIN) in a glass body through 
ion exchange, as in United States Patent Nos. 3,658,407 and 
3,667,832, or by impregnating a porous glass body with a 
photolyzable, organometallic compound and then exposing the 
impregnated body to photolyzing light, see United states 
Patent No. 4,501,468. It has been proposed to utilize a planar microlens 
array, such as described above, in conjunction with an LCD 
panel. The combination enhances the brightness of an LCD 
TV projector, but requires considerable care in aligning 
the lens array with the pixel array of the panel. Further, 
separate elements must be fabricated and processed. "Binary Optics", by Veldkamp and McHugh, Scientific 
American, May 1992, pages 92-97, describes a technique of 
etching desired optical shapes, in particular, diffractive  
 
lenses, into the surface of an optical material by masking 
and etching techniques developed for producing 
microcircuitry on silicon chips; "Fabrication of Micro 
Lenses Using Electron-Beam Lithography" by Fujita et al., 
OPTICS LETTERS, Vol. 6, No. 12, pp. 613-615, describes a 
technique for producing micro Fresnel lenses that employs 
electron-beam lithography. Basic purposes of our invention are to produce an 
improved cover glass for an LCD panel that embodies a 
microlens array, to simplify the alignment problems 
heretofore encountered, and to provide an LCD TV projector 
having enhanced brightness. Our invention resides in an integral cover glass for 
an LCD panel having an array of microlenses integral with 
the outside of its front face, whereby light is focused by 
each microlens to enhance light output from the respective 
pixel with which it is aligned in the panel. In one 
embodiment, the array of microlenses is composed of either 
diffractive gratings or spherical-shaped surfaces. In 
another embodiment, the cover glass is capable of being 
treated to form a microlens array on its
