<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biodegradable resin
composition, and an antifouling paint composition which is
employed for preventing a marine structure or the like from
damage caused by fouling aquatic organisms.A marine structure such as ship's bottoms, port
installations, buoys, pipelines, bridges, submarine bases,
aquaculture nets, fixed shore nets, installations related to
submarine oil fields, conducting tubes or intake works of
power stations, breakwaters or ship anchors are fouled by
fouling aquatic organisms such as barna-cles, shellfish,
bryozoan, algae and the like, leading to significant
economic loss.In order to prevent settlement of such fouling aquatic
organisms, the marine structure is generally coated with an
antifouling paint, which is mainly prepared from an
antifoulant of an inorganic copper compound, an organic tin
compound or the like. An antifouling paint contains rosin
as a part of its paint binder, and the antifoulant is blended
with the same, in order to prevent settlement of fouling 
aquatic organisms.On the other hand, known is a hydrolytic antifouling
paint which contains an antifouling component of a trialkyl
tin polymer. This paint is so prepared that the trialkyl
tin polymer is hydrolyzed in an underwater alkalescent
atmosphere to elute an organic tin compound, while the paint
binder is dissolved in water to elute the antifoulant as
blended (refer to GB2084167, for example).The antifoulant components eluted in such a manner have
high toxicity and exhibit antifouling performance by killing
or damaging the fouling aquatic organisms to be kept from
settlement. Every one of the conventional antifouling
paints contains a compound which is toxic for organisms
including humans as hereinabove described, and hence the
same is problematic in safety for operators. This is a
serious problem in consideration of marine pollution, which
has recently come into the spotlight.In recent years, there have been proposed a number of
silicone antifouling paints (refer to Japanese Patent
Publication No. 63-2995 (1988), for example). Such a
silicone antifouling paint utilizes water repellency and low
surface free energy of a painted surface. However, the
silicone antifouling paint has problems of imperfect
adhesion to a coating substrate, insufficient strength of a
paint film and difficulty in recoating and repair coating, 
although the same has low toxicity to the human body and a
small degree of environmental pollution. Thus, the silicone
antifouling paint is employed merely in a specific
