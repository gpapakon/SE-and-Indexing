<ABSTRACT>
A process for making inorganic gels by reaction of tetraalkoxy orthosilicates, tetraalkoxy titanates and tetraalkoxy zirconates with strong carboxylic acids. Water need not be present initially as a reactant. Optically clear, very small pore size, narrow pore size distribution, and high specific surface area inorganic gels useful for abrasion-resistant coatings, optical applications, catalyst or enzyme support, gas separation, or chromatography packing are thus produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rapid, nonaqueous process for 
producing optically clear, inorganic gels of silicon, titanium and zirconium. The above-described inorganic gels can be dried to form strong, 
hard, optically clear compositions that are useful as abrasion-resistant and 
controlled refractive index coatings in optical applications such as, for 
example, lenses and windows. They may be used as dielectric coatings arid 
anti-corrosive coatings. Additionally, the gels have a pore structure of 
extremely small size, high specific surface area and narrow pore size 
distribution which makes them useful for catalyst or enzyme support, gas 
separation and in chromatography as column packing. Inorganic gels of silicon, titanium and zirconium are typically 
created by hydrolysis of organo-silicon, -titanium and -zirconium 
compounds, and subsequent condensation of the hydrolysis products. For 
silica gels, hydrolysis, (I), and condensation, (II) and (III), are represented by 
the following equations: 
-SiOH + -SiO → -SiOSi- + ROH 
   where R is an alkyl group. Hydrolysis and condensation reactions are normally catalyzed by 
acids or bases. Existing methods of producing small pore size, high specific 
surface area, inorganic gels suffer from a number of problems. As discussed 
by C. Plank et al. in J. Colloid Sci., 2, 399 (1947) small pore, high surface area 
gel is ideally produced near the isoelectric point which for silica is about pH 
of 2. However, acid-catalyzed condensation reaction is so slow that several 
weeks or longer may be required for gelation to occur at about 25°C at this 
pH. If condensation is conducted at elevated temperature, complete  
 
gelation can occur in less time; however, pore size will increase and surface 
area will decrease. In general, alkaline or fluoride ion catalyzed gelation is 
faster but produces larger pore size gels than acid catalyzed gelation. 
Another problem is that many conventional processes use alcohol as solvent 
for reactants. Presence of alcohol enhances the reverse of reaction (I) which 
hinders production of gel. US Patent 4,950,779 (Wengrovius, et al.) discloses a process for 
making organosilicon oligomers by reacting polyalkoxysilanes or 
polyaminosilanes with formic acid without addition of water. Wengrovius' 
products are organosilicon oligomers of low molecular weight, in contrast to 
gels of silicon dioxide which are completely crosslinked networks of 
unlimited molecular weight. Wengrovius' silicone oligomers contain at least 
one
