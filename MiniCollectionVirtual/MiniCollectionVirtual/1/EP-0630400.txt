<ABSTRACT>
Automatic dishwashing detergents are provided in convenient, compact form without chlorine bleaches or phosphate builders. Thus, monopersulfate bleach such as 2KHSO5.KHSO4.K2SO4 is used in combination with protease or amylase enzymes and acrylate organic dispersants to provide good cleaning of tableware. Weak builders such as citrate and pH-adjusting agents such as carbonate, bicarbonate and silicate can be present in the composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LOW-DOSAGE AUTOMATIC DISHWASHING DETERGENT WITH MONOPERSULFATE AND ENZYMESTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is in the field of solid-form automatic dishwashing detergents. More specifically, the invention relates to nonphosphated (i.e., substantially free from inorganic phosphate builder salts) low-dosage forms of such compositions wherein there is present a beverage stain-removing amount of a monopersulfate salt. Granular and tabletted forms of the compositions are encompassed, as is a method of washing domestic tableware, such as dishes, glassware, cups and flatware, with the compositions here provided.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Automatic dishwashing detergents (ADD's) used for washing tableware in the home or institutionally in machines especially designed for the purpose have long been known. The particular requirements of cleansing tableware and leaving it in a sanitary, essentially spotless, residue-free state has indeed resulted in so many particular ADD compositions that the body of art pertaining thereto is now recognized as quite distinct from other cleansing product arts. British Patents 1,325,645; 1,527,706; and 1,381,187; European Patent Application EP-A 82,564; and U.S. Patents 4,427,417; 4,436,642; and 4,539,144 describe various aspects of ADD's, their components and their manufacture.In recent times, there has been a renewed interest among consumers in effective, economical cleansing products, especially laundry detergents, using smaller amounts of chemicals and packaging for a diminished environmental impact. In light of legislation and current environmental trends, such products are desirably substantially free of inorganic phosphate builder salts. In addition, such compositions are desirably free of chlorine bleach and "inert" filler ingredients such as sodium sulfate.Unfortunately, low-dosage nonphosphated ADD products may be made available to the consumer with a promise of effectiveness but in technical terms sacrificing efficacy, especially owing to the loss of phosphate and chlorine mainstay ingredients. Indeed, 

there does not currently appear to be a commercial low-dosage, nonphosphated ADD product which is economical and at the same time free from end-result shortcomings, such as relatively poor stain removal as compared with the same technology incorporated in regular-dosage nonphosphated formulas. Without being limited by theory, we believe stain removal shortcomings in particular are due to commercial perborate- and perborate-plus-activator ADD products relying quite

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An automatic dishwashing detergent composition which is substantially free of inorganic phosphate builders and substan¬ tially free of chlorine bleach, characterized in that it comprises:
(a) a monopersulfate bleaching salt in an amount sufficient to provide from 0.18% to 1.3%, by weight, of Available Oxygen;
(b) from 0.01% to 0.5% by weight of an active detersive enzyme;
(c) from 0.1% to 10% by weight of an organic dispersant;
(d) a pH-adjusting agent in an amount sufficient to estab¬ lish the usage pH in the range from 8 to 11;
(e) from 0% to 1.5% by weight of a chlorine scavenger;
(f) from 0% to 40% by weight of a weak nonphosphorus builder;
(g) from 0% to 4% by weight of a bleach stabilizer; and (h) from 0% to 10% by weight of a low-sudsing surfactant.
2. A composition according to Claim 1 wherein the pH-adjusting agent is selected from water-soluble carbonates, bicarbonates, silicates and mixtures thereof.
3. A composition according to Claim 1 wherein the weight ratio of organic dispersant to Available Oxygen is in the range from 0.5:1 to 5:1.
4. A composition according to Claim 1 wherein the enzyme is selected from proteases, amylases and mixtures thereof.
5. A composition according to Claim 1 wherein the water soluble silicate is characterized by a mole ratio of Si0

0 of from 1.6 to 3.
6. A composition according to Claim 1 wherein said weak builder is selected from water-soluble citrates and water-soluble gluco- heptanates. 


7. A composition according to Claim 1 wherein the organic dispersant is selected from acrylate polymers and acrylate-maleate copolymers.
8. A composition according to Claim 1 wherein the chlorine scavenger is a water-soluble perborate salt.
9. A composition according to Claim 1, characterized in that it comprises: i) from 3.5% to 25% by weight of a monopersulfate bleach of the formula 2KHS0
