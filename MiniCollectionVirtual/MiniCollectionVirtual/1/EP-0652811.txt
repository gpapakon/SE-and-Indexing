<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the recovery of raw materials from presorted collected waste, especially scrap electrochemical batteries and accumulators in which the scrap (10) is first mechanically prepared and divided into coarse and fine fractions (15, 16) which are further processed separately. Materials to be recovered are extracted by dissolution in steps by a first and a second solvent in a wet chemical preparation process from the fine fraction and then recovered individually from the two solutions.
