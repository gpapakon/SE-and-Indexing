<ABSTRACT>
In a video conference between a number N of parties, each video 
conferencing terminal produces a respective video signal comprising, 

in the case of the NTSC standard, sixty fields per second. These are 
input to an analog multi-point control unit which selects every Nth 

field from each input video signal and derives therefrom a single 
output video signal also of sixty fields per second, in which 

consecutive fields are derived cyclically from each of the N input 
video signals in turn. The single output video signal is transmitted 

to each video conferencing terminal, which separates out the fields of 
the input video signals present in the single output video signal to 

provide N individual reduced field rate video signals each comprising 
60/N fields per second and each having fields derived from a 

respective one of the input video signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to video communication apparatus. Video conference users on, say, a wide area network typically use a 
multipoint control unit to handle the multitude of video signals 
received from each party to the video conference. The commercially 
available multipoint control units connect users in a star 
configuration and accept video from each party to the conference. The 
multipoint control unit selects one video signal from the incoming 
signals and transmits the selected video signal to all other parties 
to the conference. Therefore each party can only display one video 
signal at any one time. An example of such apparatus is disclosed in 
US-A 4,710,917. An object of the present invention is to provide a communication 
apparatus which can be used to overcome this limitation of the prior 
art. Accordingly, the present invention provides a communication 
apparatus including means for deriving from a plurality of input video 
signals a single output video signal whose fields are derived cyclically 
from the fields of the input video signals. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by 
way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a video conferencing apparatus 
embodying the present invention, Figure 2 illustrates the principle of operation of the AMCU of figure 
1, Figure 3 is a block diagram of the AMCU, and Figure 4 is a block diagram of the receiver and display of a 
videoconferencing terminal of figure 1. Referring to figures 1 and 2, a video conferencing system for a 
number N of parties has N mutually remote video conferencing terminals 
10₁ to 10N. Each terminal includes a respective video camera 11₁ to 11N 
for producing a respective video signal I₁ to IN. Each video signal 
comprises, in the case of the NTSC standard, sixty fields per second. 
The video signals I₁ to IN are input, via a respective interface unit 14₁ 
to 14N and coaxial cable 105, to an analog multi-point control unit 
(AMCU) 100 which selects every Nth field from each input video signal and 
derives therefrom a single output video signal 110, also of sixty fields 
per second, in which consecutive fields F₁, F₂,.., FN are derived 
cyclically from each of the N input video signals in turn. Each terminal 10₁ to 10N also has a respective video receiver 12₁ to 
12N, and the single output video signal 110 from the AMCU 100 is 
transmitted via the respective cables 105 and the interface unit 14₁ to 
14N to each such
