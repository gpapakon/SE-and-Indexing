<DESCRIPTION>
 PIPE SEALField of the InventionThis invention relates generally to apparatus for sealing off a gas or fluid leak in a pipe and is particularly directed to apparatus for remotely clamping off a leak in a pipe while allowing workers to remain a safe distance from the leak.Background of the InventionPipelines are used extensively in industry for the transport of gases and fluids under pressure. The integrity of these pipelines is of critical importance from an environmental, safety and economic perspective. Considerable effort and expenditures are made for the purpose of detecting and repairing leaks in these pipelines.A prior art approach to repairing and sealing a pipeline leak makes use of a sealing gasket applied over the leaking portion of the pipe and a clamp for drawing and com¬ pressing the gasket in sealing engagement with the pipe. The gasket is relatively thin and when forced into position over the leaking hole in the pipe is generally in a highly stretched condition and is subject to rupture. The clamp used to position the gasket about the leak is generally comprised of various sections which require assembly and tightening by mechanical means before use. The assembly of the clamp delays sealing of the leak and allows for continued leakage of the gas or fluid.U.S. Patent No. 3,487,857 discloses a gas clamp for clamping and sealing off a leak in a gas or fluid carrying pipe. The clamp includes a pair of resilient force blocks, with one of the blocks coupled to and displaced by a hydraulic ram with a plunger. The gas clamp is hand-held and includes a hand-operated pump in combination with a hydraulic fluid accumulator for pressurizing the hydraulic ram and displacing its plunger as well as the force block to which it is coupled. This clamping device requires manual manipulation and positioning by two workers who are 

positioned close to the gas or fluid leak and thus may be subject to considerable hazard.The present invention addresses the aforementioned limitations of the prior art by providing a pipe seal for covering an opening in a pipe and sealing a gas or fluid leak which allows for remote manipulation and positioning of the sealing device for increased safety and ease of handling.Objects and Snmτrιarγ of the InventionAccordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved clamping apparatus for sealing a leak in a pipe.It is another object of the present invention to provide a pipe seal adapted for attachment to an articulated boom such as on a backhoe for sealing a
