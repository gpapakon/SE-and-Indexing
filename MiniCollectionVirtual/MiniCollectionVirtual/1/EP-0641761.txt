<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for producing dimethyl 
2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylate by reacting 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylic 

acid with methanol which comprises effecting the 
reaction at 200 to 350°C in the presence of trimethyl 

trimellitate as an essential solvent and optionally, at least 
one solvent selected from methyl benzoate, methyl toluate and 

dimethyl o-phthalate preferably by at least two-stage 
continuous reaction method. The above process is capable of 

enhancing the rate of esterification reaction and producing 
purified objective product in high yield for a long period of 

time in a stable operation without causing any operational 
trouble such as corrosion and clogging in the production 

equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing dimethyl 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylate which is
useful as a starting raw material for highly functional
polyester.As a process for producing dimethyl 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylate
through the esterification of 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylic
acid by the use of methanol, there have
heretofore been known a process by using a mineral acid such
as sulfuric acid as a catalyst (Japanese Patent Publication
No. 174/1974), a process by using an oxide or a salt of any
of various metals as a catalyst (Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open Nos. 83360/1975, 83361/1975, 8252/1976 and
48641/1976), a noncatalytic process in which the reaction is
carried out at a temperature not lower than the critical
temperature of methanol (Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 95253/1975), a continuous
esterification process (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Nos. 96574/1973 and Japanese Patent Publication No.
36179/1981), a process by using dimethyl phthalate as a
solvent (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
200657/1990) and the like.The above-mentioned processes are proposed as the 
methods of accelerating the reaction, since the rate of the
esterification reaction is extremely low because of 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylic
acid being sparingly soluble in
methanol.However, most of the above-mentioned processes is not
necessarily satisfactory from the industrial viewpoint such
as equipment and operation and is accompanied with various
problems to be solved.For example, the process by using a mineral acid such
as sulfuric acid suffers the disadvantages that the equipment
cost is undesirably increased by the necessity for the
corrosion resistance of the reactor and that a considerable
amount of methanol is lost owing to the by-production of
dimethyl ether accompanying the esterification reaction. In
addition, the process by using a metallic compound as a
catalyst, the noncatalytic process in which the reaction is
carried out at a temperature not lower than the critical
temperature of methanol and the like process are still
unsatisfactory from the industrial viewpoint such as the rate
of reaction.Moreover, the continuous esterification process
involves the problems that the sparingly methanol-soluble
2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylic acid necessitates the handling
precedure of itself as a solid, and clogging or the like is
caused in the production equipment or piping because of the
high melting point of dimethyl 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylate
that is the esterified product,
