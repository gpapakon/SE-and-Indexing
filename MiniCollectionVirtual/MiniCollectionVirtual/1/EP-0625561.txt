<ABSTRACT>
A fire-retardant composition for treating: reconstituted 
wood products, natural wood, amino-resin based adhesives, 

polymeric materials, paints, paper, cardboard, corrugated 
board, plastics laminates, articles manufactured from 

brick-like materials or cement, including salts (acidic, 
neutral or basic) of acidic coordination compounds formed 

from an aluminium compound, on the one hand, and 
coordinated with the oxygen of one or more carboxylic 

acids and possibly with the oxygen of an inorganic acid, 
on the other hand; the fire retardant properties of the 

coordination compounds optionally being enhanced by the 
synergic effect of; 1) carbonates (neutral, acidic, 

basic; preferably the carbonates of: lithium, sodium, 
potassium, magnesium, zinc); optionally also with 2) 

triazine compounds (such as, for example: benzoguanamine, 
melamine, melamine condensates (particularly melam 

(C₆H₉N₁₁), melem (C₆H₆N₁₀), melon (C₆H₃N₉)), substituted 
melamines, salified melamines, melamines coordinated with 

metals, cyanuric acid and its salts or esters); and 
optionally 3) non-complexed carboxylic acid salts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fire-retardant
compositions and fireproofing processes which are able to
retard the outbreak of fire and to inhibit flames in the
following materials and manufactured articles derived
therefrom: reconstituted wood products (that is to say:
MDF, HDF, veneers, plywood, laminated woods, laminboard,
microlaminates, chipboard) natural woods,
worked or otherwise; paper; impregnated paper; plastics
laminates; cardboard, corrugated board; amino-resin based
adhesives; thermosetting polymeric materials and articles
manufactured therefrom (of which the following may be
given as examples: alkyd, unsaturated
polyester, epoxy, acrylic, phenolic resins, aminoresins,
silicone, styrene, polyamide, allyl, expanded resins),
thermoplastics (of which the following thermoplastic
polymers are examples: polyethylene,
polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, vinyl, vinylidene,
acrylic, methacrylic, styrene, polyamide, saturated
polyester, polymers derived from cellulose,
polycarbonates, two-dimensional polyurethanes, expanded
thermoplastics), elastomers (examples of
which are: natural and synthetic rubbers, polyurethane
rubbers, expanded elastomers); paints (solvent-based or
water-based); cement and concrete, bricks and tiles.US-A-4061810 describes compositions which impart improved flame
retardancy to carpets, which comprise a physical mixture of oxides or
hydroxides of tin, antimony, aluminium or zinc with a hydroxycarboxylic
acid.The fire-retardant compositions of the invention are defined by the
appended claims.In admixture with the fire-retardant agent defined in Claim 1, the
composition of the invention may comprise as useful fire-retardants 
salts of the following acids: citric,
tartaric, malic, fumaric, and although less effective,
salts of other hydroxyacids
such as : glycolic, glyoxylic,
glyconic, glucaric, saccharic, mucic, lactic acids) or
the salts of some simple mono- or di-carboxylic acids
(examples are: formic, acetic,
oxalic, malonic, succinic, fumaric, maleic acids).The acids mentioned above are for the most part
polycarboxylic acids whereby a great variety of acid,
neutral or basic salts are possible; some of these salts
are water soluble while others are completely insoluble
in water, others are soluble in solvents, enabling them
to be usable for a wide range of applications; one aspect
of this invention is that all these salts are, although
with variable success, fire retardants.The
neutralising of these acids has particular importantance
in contributing to the final
