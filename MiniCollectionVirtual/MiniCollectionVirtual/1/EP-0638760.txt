<ABSTRACT>
A hollow imitation-candle body (1), of cylindrical or frustoconical shape, is designed to hold a removable inner body (2) for mounting the electrical equipment, which body consists of two separate parts (2', 2'') designed to be immobilised inside the body (1) by force-fitting. The said parts (2', 2'') of the inner body (2) are designed to clamp a socket (cap) intended to hold a bulb, via their upper ends (10), a supply lead being held in an axial passage (9) arranged between the said parts by a system of chicanes (19) integral with one of the said parts.

An imitation candle of the type comprising a hollow body (1) of 
cylindrical or frustoconical shape carrying in its upper part a socket 

(20) adapted to receive the base of a bulb and connected to a supply cable 
(27) which extends axially in the interior of said body, and a removable 

internal body for fitting electrical equipment, characterised in that said 
hollow internal body (2) which is formed by at least two complementary 

parts (2', 2") encloses the electrical equipment, comprising said socket 
(20) and said cable (27), said complementary parts (2', 2") being 

immobilised relative to each other in the interior of the hollow body (1) 
by forced interengagement thereof in order to grip said socket (20) in an 

upper housing (10), the cable being held in an axial passage (9) provided 
between said parts. 
An imitation candle according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
cable is held in said axial passage (9) by an array of displaced baffle 

portions (9), which is fixed with respect to one of said parts. 
An imitation candle according to either one of the preceding 
claims characterised by the use of an injectable thermoplastic material 

having good high-temperature strength characteristics such as the 
thermoplastic material marketed under the name LATENE 7H2WVO naturel. 
An imitation candle according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a fixing means (30, 33) is provided at the level of 

the lower part of said hollow body, providing the connection between said 
imitation candle and a support of the luminary type (37, 35). 
An imitation candle according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that a circulation of air is afforded along the socket 

(20) by means of flow openings (13, 40) formed by notches provided in the 
two parts (2', 2") of the internal body on respective sides of a 

connecting plane (C) thereof.
