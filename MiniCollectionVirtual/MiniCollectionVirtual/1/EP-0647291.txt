<ABSTRACT>
A gas compressor is provided comprising a chamber (9) to contain gas to be compressed, a piston (12) in the chamber (9) and means to drive the piston into the chamber (9) to compress the gas. The compressor also comprises means (55) to form a spray of liquid in the chamber (9) to cool the gas on compression therein, so that the gas may be compressed approximately isothermally. Valve means (17) are provided to allow compressed gas to be drawn from the chamber. The means to drive the piston (12) comprises means to deliver driving energy stored in a fluid directly to the piston. In one embodiment, the driving energy is provided by a combustible fuel. The heat of compression is rejected at the lowest temperatures and the hot exhaust gas from the combustion process may be used to preheat the isothermally compressed gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas compressors for
supplying compressed gas and in particular to compressors
for supplying compressed air or other gas in gas turbine
plants for the generation of electricity.Compressors for producing hot compressed gas, such as
air for burning with fuel in the combustion chamber of a
gas turbine are well known. The gas produced by the
compressor is heated as it is compressed by the adiabatic
nature of the compression cycle. Because the gas is heated
during compression, more energy is required to achieve the
desired compression than if the temperature of the gas
during compression was maintained constant, i.e. if the gas
was compressed isothermally. It is also generally
inefficient to use the mechanical energy of the compressor
to heat the body of gas being compressed.One example of a known apparatus designed to compress
gas more efficiently is the hydraulic gas compressor in
which gas is compressed in a downward moving column of
liquid. The gas which is in the form of bubbles is cooled
by the liquid during compression. The gas is then
separated from the liquid at the bottom of the column where
it is conveniently stored providing a supply of cool
compressed gas which may subsequently be used for power
generation.A heat engine whose operation is based on the Carnot
cycle is described in U.S. Patent No. 3608311. Isothermal
compression of the working fluid in the cycle is achieved
by spraying a liquid into the chamber containing the
working fluid so that the temperature of the gas is
maintained constant during compression. However, this
apparatus relates to heat engines and consists of a closed
cycle heat engine in which each volume of working fluid 
remains permanently within a respective chamber. It is not
concerned with gas compressors, which supply compressed gas.In conventional gas turbine plants the exhaust gas
from the gas turbine is generally much hotter than the
ambient temperature of the surrounding atmosphere so that
the excess heat of the exhaust gas may be wasted unless it
can be converted back into useful energy for example to
generate electricity. In one particular type of gas
turbine plant, the combined-cycle gas turbine and steam
plant (CCGT), the excess heat in the exhaust gas from the
gas turbine is converted into steam to drive a second
turbine. Although the CCGT is efficient, it does require
additional plant such as a heat recovery steam generator
and an associated steam turbine.According to one aspect of the present invention
there is provided a gas
