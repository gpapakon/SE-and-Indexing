<ABSTRACT>
A railroad crossing comprises at least one moulded element (22) which lies, between two rails (10) forming a track, directly or indirectly on the track skeleton (10, 14) or/and the ballast (16) and reaches substantially up to the rails (10), wherein a traffic-carrying surface region (22i) of the moulded element (22) reaches, in a starting position of the moulded element (22), substantially up to at least one of the two rails (10) and ends substantially flush with the top (10a) of the rail (10), and wherein the part (22d) of the moulded element (22) reaching substantially up to the rail (10) is deflectable by a wheel flange of a rail running wheel and automatically returns to the starting position when it is no longer in engagement with the wheel flange.

<CLAIMS>
A moulded article assembly (22) for a track-crossing 
comprising at least one such moulded article assembly (22), 

wherein in the installed condition between two rails (10) 
forming a track the moulded article assembly (22) is laid 

directly or indirectly on the track grid (10,14) and/or the 
ballast material, wherein on its sides facing the rails (10) 

in the installed condition the moulded article assembly (22) 
has projections (22d), which in a starting position of the 

moulded article assembly (22) extend substantially up to the 
respective rails (10), and the surface region (221) which is 

subject to traffic loads ends substantially flush with the 
upper side (10a) of the rails (10), and wherein the 

projections (22d) of the moulded article assembly (22) 
extending substantially up to the rails (10) can be 

deflected by the flanges (34a) of rail wheels (34) and 
return automatically into their original position when they 

are no longer in contact with the flanges (34a),
 
characterised in that the moulded article assembly (22) is 

formed substantially entirely from rubber material, in that 
in the surface region (221) of the moulded article assembly 

(22) which is subject to traffic loads, in the vicinity of 
the projections (22d), at least one groove (22e, 22m) is 

formed extending in the longitudinal direction of the rails 
in the installed condition, and in that the moulded article 

assembly (22) can be inserted between the two rails (10) 
forming a track. 
A moulded article assembly according to Claim 1, 
wherein the moulded article assembly has a core region of 

vulcanised scrap rubber material and also on at least one 
side, which is subject to traffic loads, a substantially 

closed paving skin of vulcanised crude rubber, characterised  
 

in that the projections (22d) of the moulded article 
assembly (22), which extend substantially up to the rails 

(10) and which can be deflected by the flanges (34a) of rail 
wheels (34), are formed substantially entirely of crude 

rubber. 
A moulded article assembly according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the moulded article assembly (22) is 

of such dimensions that in the installed condition of the 
moulded article assembly (22) the distance of its 

projections (22d) extending substantially up to the rails 
(10) from the respective rail (10) is such that upon 

deflection by the flanges (34a) of rail wheels (34) these 
members (22d) do not come into contact with the respective 

rail (10). 
A moulded article assembly according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the moulded article 

assembly (22) is provided with at least one abutment surface 
(22k) which, in its installed condition, co-operates with an 

associated counter-abutment surface (22d), which is formed 
on centering elements (20), for centering the moulded 

article assembly (22) between the rails (10). 
A moulded article assembly according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that at least one surface 

region (221) of the moulded article assembly (22), which is 
subject to traffic loads, is provided with a grooved surface 

configuration (32). 
A moulded article assembly according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the grooved surface configuration (32) 

has a diamond pattern. 
A moulded article assembly according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a surface region (221) 

of the moulded article assembly (22), which is subject to 
traffic loads, is provided with nails and/or spikes (36).
