<ABSTRACT>
A compound comprises a target cell-specific portion, such as an antibody specific to tumour cell antigens, and an inactivating portion, such as an enzyme, capable of converting a substance which in its native state is able to inhibit the effect of a cytotoxic agent into a substance which has less effect against said cytotoxic agent. The prolonged action of a cytotoxic agent at tumour sites is therefore possible whilst protecting normal tissues from the effects of the cytotoxic agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to potentially cytotoxic agents which may be targeted to
selected cells, and is particularly concerned with the action of agents used in
the treatment of cancer.Most forms of cancer tend to disseminate in the body at an early stage and the
ultimate aim of cancer therapy is to achieve elimination of cancers, preferably
without incurring serious toxic effects on host systems. Combinations of
cytotoxic agents have proved curative in a small range of relatively uncommon
cancers, but single agents and combinations of them have failed to achieve
major therapeutic benefits in most patients with the common cancers of lung.
breast, colon, rectum, pancreas, prostate etc.Cytotoxic agents can only be given by intermittent dose schedules because of
their effects on normal tissues in which cell renewal is active such as
haemopoietic tissues and epithelia of the alimentary tract. The rest period
between treatments which is necessary to allow recovery of these normal tissues
from the effects of the cytotoxic substances tends to be of much greater
duration than the period of administration of the cytotoxic agents.Substances involved in cell division are the commonest targets for cytotoxic
agents and amongst these are substances involved in the synthesis of
nucleotides, the basic components of DNA and RNA. The enzymes
ribonucleotide reductase, dihydrofolate reductase and thymidine synthetase are
typical targets. The enzyme dihydrofolate reductase acts on a dietary factor,
folic acid, to produce the active co-enzyme 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. The
co-enzyme is required for one carbon transfer in various syntheses including
that of pyrimidines required for DNA synthesis. The widely used drug
methotrexate (2,4-diamino-N10-methylpteroylglutamic acid) acts by binding 
strongly to dihydrofolate reductase preventing regeneration of active
tetrahydrofolate and thus interrupting DNA synthesis and leading to death of
cells entering S phase of the cell cycle in which DNA is duplicated.
Methotrexate is generally available, for example from Cyanamid Inc.The drug trimetrexate (NSC 352122; 2,4-diamino-5-methyl-6-[3,4,5-trimethoxyanilino
methyl]quinazoline) also acts by binding to
dihydrofolate reductase but whereas methotrexate enters cells via the folate
receptors, trimetrexate enters by alternative mechanism(s). The synthesis of
trimetrexate is disclosed by Baker (1967) in Design of site-directed irreversible
enzyme inhibitors, Wiley, New York, and by Elslager et al (1974) Lectures in
heteroeyclic chemistry,
