<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a treatment device for 
treating lug scrap strips produced by the slit of 

metallic strips, in a metallic strip slitter for 
removing the lug scrap strips either by generally 

slitting a wide metallic strip (1) into a plurality of 
narrow metallic strips (10) using slitter knives (3) or 

slitting the wide metallic strip lugs on both sides on 
the way of allowing the wide metallic strips (1) to be 

driven while continuously delivering the metallic strip 
(1). The treatment device for lug scrap strips 

comprises air-operated ducts (5a,5b) for introducing the 
lug scrap strips (11), a scrap cutter (8) provided on 

the way of the air-operated duct (5a) and for 
continuously cutting the long lug scrap strip (11) at a 

predetermined period, a blower (5) provided at the rear 
of the scrap cutter (8) on the way of the air-operated 

duct (5), a scrap collector (6) provided at the end of 
the air-operated duct (5b), and a scrap press (7) 

attached to the scrap collector (6), and the driving of 
the scrap cutter (8) is controlled on the basis of the 

line speed of the metallic strip slitter (3a). Thus, 
the occurrence of the plugging-up by the lug scrap strip 

pieces can be prevented on the way of the scrap 
treatment line after the lug scrap strip (11) is cut 

into lug scrap strip pieces (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a treatment device for
treating lug scrap strips produced by the slit of
metallic strips, in a metallic strip slitter for
removing the lug scrap strips either by generally
slitting a wide metallic strip into a plurality of
narrow metallic strips by means of slitter knives, or
slitting the wide metallic strip lugs on both sides on
the way of allowing the wide metallic strips to be
driven while continuously delivering the metallic
strips. More specifically, it relates to a lug scrap
strip treating device which is suitable to such a
metallic strip slitter as used for thinner metallic
strips as its object.Referring to Figs. 4 through 6, a treatment
device for lug scrap strips in a metallic strip slitter
of the prior art will be explained.A wide and thin metallic strip 1 (e.g., aluminum
or its alloy having a thickness of 0.4 mm or less)
rolled on a core 20 of an uncoiler 2 in a form of coil
is continuously delivered by a pair of pinch rollers 30 
in the arrow direction indicated by A against the line
of a slitter 3a. Subsequently, the metallic strip 1 is
made flat while being guided by guide rollers 31 and 32
in a S-letter form. Then, the metallic strip 1 is
guided by another pair of pinch rollers 33 into between
slitter knives 3.The metallic strip 1 is slit by the slitter
knives 3 and divided into a plurality of narrow metallic
strips 10 as a product and lug scrap strips 11 on both
sides, respectively.The metallic strips 10 as a product are passed
through a pair of pinch rollers 34, a loop pit 35 and
another pair of pinch rollers 36, and then rolled round
a core 40 of a coiler 4.On the other hand, the resulting lug scrap strips
11 are guided to an air-operated duct 5a in a lug scrap
strip treatment device b by other pinch rollers b1 and
b2, and then cut and crushed by a blower 5 having a
crusher structure.As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the blower 5
comprises: a rotating blade 50 radially mounted on the
end of a rotating shaft 51; a casing 52 for
accommodating the rotating blade 50 and rotatably
supporting the rotating shaft 51; an admission port 53
formed in the casing 52 so as to face to the rotating
blade 50; and an exhaust port 54 formed in the casing 52
so as to extend in the direction of rotation of the 
rotating blade 50.Since cutting portions 55 for crushing and fixed
cutting portions 56 are attached to the rotating blade
50 and the admission port 53 of the casing 52,
respectively, a long lug scrap strip 11 sucked from the
admission port 53 is crushed and deformed by these
cuttin

<CLAIMS>
A treatment device for lug scrap strips from a metallic strip
slitter comprising :


air-operated ducts (5a,5b) for guiding a long lug scrap strip
(11) ;
a blower (5) on the way of said air-operated duct (5a) ;
a scrap collector (6) provided at the end of said air-operated
duct (5b) ; and
a scrap press (7) attached to said scrap collector (6) ;
characterized in that the device further comprises


a scrap cutter (8) ) for continuously cutting the lug scrap strip
(11) at a predetermined period provided on the way of said air-operated

duct (5a) and installed in front of said blower (5) ;

   wherein the driving of said scrap cutter (8) is controlled on
the basis of the line speed of a metallic strip sitter (3a), said scrap cutter

(8) including a rotor (80) having one or a plurality of rotary cutting portions
provided on the outer periphery (82) in parallel with a rotating shaft

center ; a casing (83) having a supply port (84) and an exhaust port (85)
along the flow direction of said air-operated ducts (5a ; 5b) and for

rotatably accomodating said rotor (80) under the condition that said rotary
cutting portions (82) intersect the flow direction of said air-operated ducts

(5a ;5b) ; and a fixed cutting portion (86) provided on the side of said
supply port (84) of said casing (83) under the condition that said rotary

cutting portions (82) are opposed to and brought into contact with the
fixed cutting portion repeatedly or in close proximity to the fixed cutting
