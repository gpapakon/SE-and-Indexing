providing a base station positioned essentially at the center of the area to 

be protected, the said base station being provided with scanning laser 
beam generating and receiving means, image and signal processing units, 

memory means, voice receiving and transmitting means and image 
viewing means; b) causing a laser beam generated by the base station 

to be reflected from the surveyed area into the receiving means of the 
base station; c) processing the received reflected light to generate an 

image of the surveyed area; d) storing one or more scanned images in 
memory means, to be used as reference images; e) at any given time, 

comparing a real-time scanned image with one or more stored reference 
image(s), to determine changes which have occurred on the image, which 

exceed predetermined threshold values, and alerting the operator of the 
base station of any such changes; f) providing one or more moving 

station(s) comprising emitting/receiving laser generating means and 
signal processing means, and causing the said moving station to generate 

an emitted signal which identifies it; and g) providing recognition means 
within the signal processing means of the base station, to recognize the 

signal generated by the moving station as a friendly signal, and to alert 
the operator of the base station whether a change in the image of the 

scanned area belongs to a friendly or to an unfriendly force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for surveying a 
predetermined area and, at the same time, for communicating with 
friendly forces found within the surveyed area. More particularly, the 
invention relates to the use of laser emission for achieving the said 
purposes. It is a well known problem, when surveying a given area, to be able to 
distinguish between friendly and unfriendly forces moving through it. 
Nonnally, the area surveyed is scanned either visually or by movement 
detecting means, e.g, apparatus which detects heat, and the surveying 
person is thus alerted of that movement takes place within the surveyed 
area. When friendly forces move through the surveyed area, the 
surveying person normally identifies them by maintaining radio contact, 
or by visual signs, when possible. However, identifying moving persons by 
radio transmission presents severe drawbacks: the radio transmission can 
be easily picked up by unfriendly forces moving through the area, heavy 
radio equipment must be carried if voice communication is desired, and if 
a simple emitted identification signal is used, it can be relatively easily 
forged.  The prior art has made use of laser emission in a limited way. For 
instance, US 5,063,288 deals with an apparatus for securing a confined 
space with a laser emission, by generating laser vertical securing planes 
from a laser beam and reflecting them into a formation confining a plane. 
Shielding or interruption of a laser vertical securing plane by an intruder 
generates an alarm signal. US 3,623,057 discloses a laser perimeter intrusion detection system, in 
which laser beams are generated which define the perimeter of the area 
to be protected. When a beam is interrupted by an intruder an alarm is 
generated. Other systems employ directional apparatus, such as pointers, to 
determine the location of a target, such as in US 4,017,716 or US 
5,055,666. The prior art systems have so far failed to provide simple and effective 
systems in which an area can be surveyed using laser beams. 
Furthermore, the art has so far not provided an effective friend-or-foe 
(FOF) determination system, to discriminate between authorized and 
non-authorized movement in a given area. It is an object of the invention to provide a system and a method which 
overcome the drawbacks of prior art systems.  It is another object of the invention to provide a surveying system which 
can be effectively used to survey a given area and to alert the surveying 
person of movements which take place
