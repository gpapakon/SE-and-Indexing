<ABSTRACT>
An ABS/polycarbonate resin blend is provided 
which comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin 

and an ABS graft copolymer. The blend exhibits 
reduced gloss and preferably reduced opacity. 

The ABS resin comprises small particle size 
butadiene rubber which is preferably styrenebutadiene 

and comprises a styrene acrylonitrile 
copolymer graft portion which is rich in styrene. 

The blends are useful as molding resins and 
exhibit reduced gloss and reduced opacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blends of ABS 
graft copolymers with polycarbonate resin, and 
more particularly relates to reduced gloss blends 
of ABS graft copolymers with polycarbonate resin. Compositions containing a blend of 
polycarbonate and ABS graft polymer are known, 
see for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4677162 and 
4526926 which are incorporated herein by 
reference. In some applications, it is desired to provide 
reduced gloss blends of ABS resin with 
polycarbonate resin. Accordingly, the present invention provides 
reduced gloss blends of an ABS graft polymer and 
a polycarbonate resin. The present invention involves a polycarbonate 
resin/ABS graft copolymer blend exhibiting 
reduced gloss and preferably reduced opacity. 
The blends comprise an aromatic polycarbonate 
resin and a graft copolymer which has a styreneacrylonitrile 
copolymer graft portion that is 
rich in styrene and has a diene rubber substrate 
which has a small particle size and which is 
preferably a styrene-butadiene rubber. The 
blends are useful as molding resins exhibiting 
reduced gloss and reduced opacity.  The polycarbonate component included in the 
blend compositions may be any aromatic homopolycarbonate 
or co-polycarbonate known in the 
art. The polycarbonate component may be prepared 
in accordance with any of the processes generally 
known in the art, for example, by the interfacial 
polycondensation process, polycondensation in a 
homogeneous phase or by transesterification. 
These processes and the associated reactants, 
polymers, catalysts, solvents and conditions are 
well known in the art and are described in U.S. 
Pat. Nos. 2,964,974; 2,970,137; 2,999,835; 
2,999,846; 3,028365; 3,153,008; 3,187,065; 
3,215,668; 3,258,414 and 5,010,162, all of which 
are incorporated herein by reference. Suitable 
polycarbonates are based, for example, on one or 
more of the following bisphenols: dihydroxy 
diphenyls, bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-alkanes, bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-cycloalkanes, 
bis-(hydroxyphenyl)sulphides, 
bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-ethers, 
bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-ketones, bis(hydroxyphenyl)-sulphoxides, 
bis-(hydroxyphenyl)-sulphones, 
alkyl cyclohexylidene bisphenols, α,α-bis-(hydroxyphenyl)diisopropyl 
benzenes, and 
their nucleus-alkylated and nucleus-halogenated 
derivatives, and mixtures thereof. Specific examples of these bisphenols are 4, 
4'-dihydroxy diphenyl, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane, 
2, 4-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methyl 
butane, 1, 1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-cyclohexane, 
α,α-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-diisopropyl
