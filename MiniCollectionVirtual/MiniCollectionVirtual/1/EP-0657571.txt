<ABSTRACT>
Warp-knitted briefs (21) produced from two congruent webs of knitted fabric which are knitted in one another at a distance transversely to their production direction over the web width in order to form side seams and which, in each case, are knitted in one another centrally between two side seams (3), starting from one of the web longitudinal edges, to form a gusset region, there being provided in each case in the vicinity of the side seams additional punctiform connection points (12, 13) between the two webs of knitted fabric which form the front side and rear side of the briefs, the said connection points being capable of being torn apart under a predetermined tensile load without damage to the material of the webs of knitted fabric.

<CLAIMS>
Warp knitted briefs (21, 22) produced of two congruent 
lengths of knitted material (1, 2) which form the front 

and the back of the briefs (21, 22) and which, 
transversely to their direction of production, are 

knitted together across the width of the material, with a 
distance therebetween, for the purpose of forming side 

seams (3) and which are knitted together to form a gusset 
region (7) halfway between the two side seams (3), 

lengthwise one of the longitudinal material edges (4, 5),
 
characterised in
 
that in the vicinity of the side seams (3) there are 

provided additional point-like connecting areas (12, 13, 
14) between the two lengths of knitted material (1, 2), 

which connecting areas are tearable under a predetermined 
tensile load without damaging the knitted lengths of 

material (1, 2) or the side seams (3). 
Briefs according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that the connecting areas (12, 13) are arranged in lines, 

especially in a plurality of lines, extending parallel 
to the side seams (3).  

 
Briefs according to claim 1,
 
characterised in
 
that the connecting areas (14) are distributed grid-like 

over a region which extends parallel to the side seams 
(3). 
Briefs according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in
 
that the leg openings (6) are formed by non-connected 

side edges (4, 5) of the lengths of knitted material (1, 
2). 
Briefs according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in
 
that the leg openings (6) are formed by slits provided 

in the direction of the material length in one of the 
lengths of knitted material (1) in the vicinity of one 

of the longitudinal edges (4, 5), whereas the lengths 
of knitted material (1, 2) are connected to one another 

at one of the the adjoining longitudinal edges (4, 5). 
Briefs according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in
  
 

that in the region of the leg openings (6), the side 

seams (3) are partially tearable if an increase in load 
occurs, prior to damaging the length of material. 
Briefs according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterised in
 
that in an area which immediately adjoins the side seams 

(3), in parts of the region of the leg openings (6) in 
at least one of the lengths of material (1, 2) there are 

provided weak areas or openings for specifically tearing 
open the length of material along the side seams (3) if 

an increase in load occurs.
