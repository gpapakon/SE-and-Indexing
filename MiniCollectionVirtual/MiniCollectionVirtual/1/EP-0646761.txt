<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for mounting the barrel (5) of a medium-calibre or large-calibre weapon on a sleeve (3) of the breech assembly of the weapon. The system comprises a nut (10) intended to be screwed onto a threaded end (12) of the barrel (5). The nut (10) is mounted freely within the sleeve, and the device for driving the nut (10) in rotation consists of a gear device (13) and of a control means (15) actuated from outside the sleeve (3) and intended for coming into engagement with the said gear device (13).

System for mounting the barrel of a medium or large
calibre gun on to a sleeve on the gun's breech block

assembly, the said system being of the type comprising a
nut intended to be screwed on a threaded end of the barrel,

characterised in that the nut (10) is fitted free through
an opening into a cavity (8) of the sleeve (3) to receive

the said threaded end (12) of the barrel once this is
inserted inside the sleeve (3) and in that the said system

also comprises a drive system for rotating the nut (10)
which consists of a gear mechanism (13) and a drive system

(15) operated from outside the sleeve (3) and designed to
engage with the gear mechanism (13).
System according to claim 1, characterised in that
the gear mechanism (13) comprises a pinion (17) which

engages with straight teeth (19) made on the outer surface
of the nut (10).
System according to claim 2, characterised in that
the pinion (17) is mounted on a shaft (20) of which at

least one end projects outside the sleeve (3), and in that
the drive system (15) consists of a tool such as a spanner

designed to engage with the shaft (20) to cause it to
rotate.
System according to claim 3, characterised in that
the pinion (17) is entirely located outside the sleeve (3),

this pinion (17) engaging with the teeth (19) of the nut
(10) through a hole (22a) in the sleeve (3) which opens

into the cavity (8) containing the said nut (10).
System according to claim 3, characterised in that
it also comprises a locking device (25) to prevent the

pinion (17) from rotating in a direction opposite to that
appropriate for screwing the nut (10), this device (25)

being declutchable in order to allow the barrel (5) to be
removed.
System according to claim 1, characterised in that
the gear mechanism (13) comprises a worm (40) which engages

with helical teeth (19) made on the outer surface of the 
nut (10), the said worm (40) being fitted free in a space

(41) machined in the thickness of the sleeve (3) and the
said space (41) opening into that containing the nut (10).
System according to claim 6, characterised in that
the worm (40) is hollow and in that the drive system (15)

operated from outside the sleeve (3) consists of a tool
such as a spanner which is inserted inside the worm (40) in

order to cause this to rotate.
System according to claim 7, characterised in that
it also comprises a locking device (25) to prevent the worm

(40) from rotating until the drive system (15) is inserted
in the said worm.
System according to claim 8, characterised in that
the locking device (25) comprises a plunger (45) housed

inside the worm (40) and capable of being moved axially
between two positions, a retractable locking pin (50) and a

return spring (55) which tends automatically to return the
plunger (45) to its locking position, the said pin (50)

being designed either to engage in a hole (52) of the
sleeve (3) to prevent the worm from rotating when the

plunger (45) is in its locking position, or to be retracted
inside a groove (48) made in the body (47) of the plunger

(45) when the said plunger is in its alternative position
which permits the worm (40) to rotate.
System according to claim 9, characterised in that
the drive system (15) is inserted inside the worm (40) in

order to push the plunger (45) and to release it from its
locking position, the plunger (45) returning automatically

to its locking position under the action of the return
spring (45) when the drive system (15) is released from the

worm (40).
