<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to topical
pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antidotal
effective amount of the anti-anthracycline antibiotic
monoclonal antibody. These compositions are useful for
decreasing the toxic effect caused by the
administration of anthracycline antibiotics.The invention particularly relates to the use of
anti-anthracycline monoclonal antibodies or fragments
thereof for the preparation of topical medicaments
useful for preventing anthracycline-induced alopecia.The term fragment, as used herein, means for
instance Fab chain.Anthracycline antibiotics are a widely
investigated class of compounds having antitumor
activity. Particularly, doxorubicin (DXR) is being used
for a long time in antitumor chemotherapy protocols.The clinical usefulness of anthracycline
antibiotics is limited by serious side effects such as
cardiomyophaty, bone-marrow depression, gastrointestinal
tract mucositis and, if there is drug leakage at
the injection site, local tissue necrosis.Another peculiar side effect consists in alopecia,
which is due to the inhibiting activity exerted by
anthracyclines on the continuously growing cells of
hair roots. Alopecia occurs in almost the totality of
the patients treated with anthracycline drug.Although not life-threatening, drug-induced
alopecia can be psychologically devastating for a 
patient and may lead to refusal of chemotherapy.
Clearly, its prevention has implications for improving
patient adaption to chemotherapy. Attempts to eliminate
this psychologically and socially traumatic side effect
by using tourniquets or hypothermia to reduce scalp
blood flow have met with little success, as both
approaches are effective only with low-dose
anthracycline treatment. EP-A-503484 teaches the use of anti-anthracycline
antibodies for the reduction of anthracycline side-effects.Now it has surprisingly been found that anti-anthracycline
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and
particularly anti-doxorubicin antibodies, when
topically applied, effectively prevent hair loss
induced by anthracycline administration.It is particularly surprising that monoclonal
antibodies are able of penetrating the stratum corneum
of the skin without losing their function.According to the present invention, anti-anthracycline
MAbs, prepared as described in EP-A-0316776
and Int. J. Cancer 42, 798-802, 1988 and
Anticancer Res. 10, 129-132, 1990, from the hybridoma
deposited at ECACC under no. 90011003 on January 12,
1990, are administered to patients affected by tumors
which are sensitive to treatment
