<ABSTRACT>
The occurrence of offsetting and strike-through in 
a stencil printing device is prevented without creating 

any new problems, and the printing paper is allowed to 
be conveyed with a pair of rollers interposing the 

printing paper for a reliable paper ejection process. 
Printing paper (P) is passed through a nip between a 

contact roller (37) and a counter roller (39) opposing the 
contact roller (37), the outer circumferential surface of 

the contact roller being coated with a layer of excess 
ink removing liquid which does not dissolve with the 

printing ink forming the printed image and has smaller 
surface tension than the printing ink, and the contact 

between the excess ink removing liquid layer 
a
 of the 
contact roller (37) and the printed surface of the 

printing paper (P) causes the excess portion of the 
printing ink (
b
) deposited on the printed image of the 
printing paper to be transferred onto the excess ink 

removing liquid layer (
a
) so as to remove the excess ink 
from the printing paper (P). The contact roller may be 

replaced with an endless contact belt (83).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a 
device for post-processing a printed image for use in a 
printing device such as a stencil printing device, and 
in particular to a method and a device for post-processing 
a printed image which can prevent offsetting 
and strike-through. In the printing process using printing ink of a 
liquid form, when printing paper sheets are stacked one 
over the other immediately after printing, the printing 
ink deposited on one sheet of printing paper may adhere 
to the overlying sheet of printing paper, or so-called 
offsetting may occur. Also, if the printed image is 
touched by a finger or the like immediately after 
printing, the printed image may be smeared. If the 
deposited ink is excessive, the ink may penetrate the 
printing paper, and may show on the other side of the 
paper sheet or, in other words, strike-through may 
occur. These problems are particularly serious in 
stencil printing where the amount of ink or the ink 
deposit for forming the printed image on the printing 
paper is relatively great. Conventionally, to avoid the occurrence of 
offsetting and strike-through, various measures have 
been taken, such as reducing the amount of ink deposit 
for forming a printed image on the printing paper 
during the printing process, and speeding up the drying 
of the printing ink by heating the printing ink 
deposited on the printing paper. When printing paper is conveyed to an ejected 
paper tray or a sorter upon completion of printing, the 
conveying rollers cannot engage the front face of the  
 
printing paper with printing ink deposited thereon 
because the printed image must be protected from 
contact. Therefore, conventionally, printing paper was 
conveyed without touching the front face of the 
printing paper carrying the printed image by using a 
conveying mechanism such as a belt conveyor which acts 
only upon the reverse surface (the face not carrying 
any printed image) of the printing paper. Such a 
printing paper conveying device is disclosed, for 
instance, in Japanese patent laid open (kokai) 
publication No. 50-88769. Attempts to prevent offsetting and strike-through 
in the printing process by reducing the amount of ink 
deposit give rise to various problems. Controlling the 
amount of ink deposit so as to prevent strike-through 
is highly difficult, and excessive reduction in the 
amount of ink deposit causes degradation of image 
quality, such as insufficiency in print density. Attempts to prevent offsetting and strike-through
