<ABSTRACT>
The synthesis and the application of new dyes is described. In 
particular said new dyes can be incorporated in non-migratory state in 

hydrophilic colloid layers of photographic materials wherefrom they can 
be rapidly removed after being quickly decolourized in alkaline aqueous 

liquids used in the processing of said materials. In photographic 
applications dyes of the general formula (I) are provided with at least 

one ionizable group which permits solubilization in aqueous and/or 
alkaline medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new class of dyes and their
applications.Dyes may be used for the dyeing of several very different
materials like e.g. natural and synthetic fibers, textiles, plastics
and leather. Dyes may be used further as acid-base indicators, as
biological stains, as filter dyes, antihalation dyes or dyes
providing more sharp images in photographic applications, for
information recording, printing inks, camouflage, as light-collecting
elements, for the colouring of food, as an analytical
reagent, as a transfer dye in dye-transfer photographic materials
and in many other applications.In photography dyes may be divided into spectrally and non-spectrally
sensitizing dyes, indicating whether the dyes are
adsorbed or not at the surface of the light-sensitive silver halide
crystals used in photographic elements.Non-spectrally sensitizing dyes e.g. are widely used in a
photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer as screening dyes, in an
undercoat adjacent to the photosensitive layer and/or in a backing
layer on the side of the support opposite to the photosensitive
layer(s) to absorb reflected and scattered light. Its function as
antihalation dye or in an overcoat or interlayer to shield a
particular photosensitive layer against undesired exposure being
therefore referred to as filter or absorber dye is highly
appreciated. The adjustment of the sensitivity of a photographic
element as required in the production specifications is another
application.For example in order to improve image sharpness an absorber dye
can be present in one or more filter layers between silver halide
emulsion layers that are coated at opposite sides of a transparent
film support of an X-ray recording material. The imagewise exposure
of said recording material proceeds in a cassette between a pair of
X-ray intensifying screens that each are held in contact with an 
adjacent silver halide emulsion layer. By said arrangement the
imaging light that would cross the support and to some extent
becomes scattered thereby, is considerably attenuated and cannot
give rise to an unsharp image in an opposite silver halide emulsion
layer.Spectrally the dye absorption spectrum should approximately be
equal to the sensitivity spectrum of the corresponding silver halide
emulsion in the layer of which a sharp image has to be reproduced.On the one hand it is very important that filter dyes remain,
i.e. that they are non-migratory, in the layer wherein they have
been incorporated especially when this layer is in direct contact
with
