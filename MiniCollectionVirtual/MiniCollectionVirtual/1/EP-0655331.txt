<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for monitoring the positioning in correct register of printing plates on the plate cylinder of printing machines, in particular sheet offset printers, the plate cylinder having stops which are electrically connected to an oscillatory circuit in the region of the clamping rail assigned to the start of printing. A known device of this kind is upgraded in detail such that a more precise determination of the positioning in correct register and in particular the location where the printing plate is not in correct register can be determined. For this purpose, it is proposed to assign to each stop a secondary-side oscillatory circuit with a coil which can then be excited in a specific position of the plate cylinder by means of an adjustable primary coil in each case. In particular, the primary coils are suspended from the plate cylinder in a pivotable fashion by means of a lever-like adjustment device.

Device for checking the register correct lay-up of 
printing plates on the plate cylinder of printing 

presses, particularly offset sheet printing presses, 
in which the plate cylinder has a clamping rail 

arranged relative to the print start on which stops 
are installed which cooperate with the front edge of 

the printing plate and the stops are part of a 
secondary side oscillating circuit with a secondary 

coil installed on the plate cylinder, which at one 
angular position of the plate cylinder can be 

stimulated by a primary coil fed by an oscillator, 
characterised in that arranged relative to each stop 

(7) is a secondary side oscillating circuit with in 
each case a secondary coil (11) and that arranged 

relative to each secondary coil (11) of a stop (7) 
installed on the machine side is a primary coil 

(12). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the secondary coils (11) are arranged in the stop 

(7) in such a fashion that the axis of the secondary 
coil (11) is oriented in the substantially radial 

direction of the plate cylinder (1). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the secondary coil (11) as well as the 

condenser (13) of the secondary oscillating circuit 
of each stop (7) is installed in the stops (7). 
Device according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised 
in that a secondary coil (11) is arranged relative 

to each primary coil (12) via a positioning device 
(15) installed on the frame. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that  
 

the positioning device (15) of the primary coil (12) 
is constructed as a lever arm swivellable about an 

axis running parallel to the axis of the plate 
cylinder (1). 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised in 
that the positioning device (15) of the primary coil 

(12) is installed on the protection movably arranged 
in front of the printing unit cylinders. 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that each stop (7) on the side 

turned towards the U-shaped stamping out (5.1) of 
the printing plate (5), has two contact surfaces 

(19) electrically insulated one from another which 
are bridged on register correct lay-up of the 

printing plate (5). 
Device according to one of the preceding Claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the side of the stop (7) 

turned towards the front edge of the printing plate 
(5) has a contact surface (20) insulated with 

respect to the stop (7) and the stop (7) lies with a 
further contact surface (21) at the potential of the 

plate cylinder (1). 
Device according to Claim 7 or 8, characterised in 
that the stops (7) are made from an electrically 

insulating material.
