<ABSTRACT>
An implantable medical device for human implant. The device includes a telemetry transmitter and receiver for communicating information from the implanted device to an external programmer or monitor and for receiving commands or other information from an external programmer. The device is provided with one or more sensors and means for monitoring, recording and storing the recordings of physiologic signals after implant. The device is provided with a waveform compression and storage system which stores monitored signals in the form of defined analog voltages maintained within the device, rather than employing more traditional digital storage techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of
cardiac pacemakers, and more particularly relates to the
storage of analog signals therein.A wide variety of cardiac pacemakers are known and commercially
available. Pacemakers are generally characterized by which chambers of
the heart they are capable of sensing, the chambers to which they deliver
pacing stimuli, and their responses, if any, to sensed intrinsic
electrical cardiac activity. Some pacemakers deliver pacing stimuli at
fixed, regular intervals without regard to naturally occurring cardiac
activity. More commonly, however, pacemakers sense electrical cardiac
activity in one or both of the chambers of the heart, and inhibit or
trigger delivery of pacing stimuli to the heart based on the occurrence
and recognition of sensed intrinsic electrical events. A so-called "VVI"
pacemaker, for example, senses electrical cardiac activity in the
ventricle of the patient's heart, and delivers pacing stimuli to the
ventricle only in the absence of electrical signals indicative of natural
ventricular contractions. A "DDD" pacemaker, on the other hand, senses
electrical signals in both the atrium and ventricle of the patient's
heart, and delivers atrial pacing stimuli in the absence of signals
indicative of natural atrial contractions, and ventricular pacing stimuli
in the absence of signals indicative of natural ventricular contractions.
The delivery of each pacing stimulus by a DDD pacemaker is synchronized
with prior sensed or paced events.Pacemakers are also known which respond to other types of
physiological based signals, such as signals from sensors for measuring
the pressure inside the patient's ventricle or measuring the level of the
patient's physical activity. These are labeled "VVIR" for a single
chamber version or "DDDR" for a dual chamber version.The complexity of modern pacemakers, the occurrence of rare device
failures, or, more commonly, physiologic changes, and device variables or 
drift dictate the need for numerous programmable parameters accessible
noninvasively via an externally operated programmer. The need to assess
system performance or troubleshoot the patient, device and/or lead system
in an acute, clinical setting or long-term, while the patient is
ambulatory, is increasing.Ambulatory EKG monitoring is the most effective way of determining
satisfactory pacemaker or cardioverter/defibrillator function. In the
presence of a malfunction that has occurred or has been provoked by daily
activity, there is no technique that provides better
