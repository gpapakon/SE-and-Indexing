A small micro-robot having a size of about 1 cm³ and capable of being controlled wirelessly. The robot 
comprises at least two photosensors (12, 14) having detection regions thereof partially overlapping with each other; 

at least a pair of driving portions (28, 30) driven mutually independently and having driving points spaced apart in a 
direction orthogonal to a moving direction; a control unit (58) including a CPU and controlling the driving portions on 

the basis of the output of the photosensors; a power supply (16) having a chargeable battery and a voltage regulation 
circuit (56) for regulating the voltage of the battery to supply power to the photosensors, the driving portions and the 

control portion; and a reset circuit (40) for sending a reset signal to the control portion on receiving non-contactively 
an instruction from outside. The invention discloses also a storage case of the micro-robot capable of charging the 

robot during storage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a robot having a
size of about one cubic centimeter and adapted for
wireless control, and a holding case for accommodating
the robot which is capable of charging, etc., during the
period of accommodation.In the past, the wireless control of a robot has
been effected by a control which is called as a radio
control and a control system utilizing radio waves has
been used. Also, the directional control has been
effected by superposing control signals on the radio
waves to steer the robot. On the other hand, it has
been the practice to use a directional antenna or to
concurrently utilize visual sensors or the like to
direct the robot in the desired direction in a self-control
manner. The running part includes wheels to
reduce the running resistance. Also, its charging
terminals are composed of rigid contacts which are
formed in the recess of a frame member.However, since the previously mentioned robot
control system utilizes the radio waves, each of the
transmitting side and the receiving side requires many
electric elements and a mechanism for steering purposes 
is required thereby making the system unsuited for
miniaturing purposes. Also, in order to realize for
example a system which causes the robot to autonomously
move in a direction in which the radio waves are
transmitted, the previously mentioned antenna or
sensors must be additionally provided and in this
respect the system is not suited for the purposes of
miniaturization. Moreover, where the parts other than
the driving parts are supported by the wheels, it is
impossible to go over the large irregularities if the
wheels are small, whereas the miniaturization is
difficult if the wheels are large. The reduction of the
charging terminals in size is impossible from the
standpoint of the handling and this becomes an obstacle
for the miniaturization.In view of these circumstances, the present
inventor has developed a micro robot movable by sensing
light and has filed an international application as
PCT/JP92/01415. This micro robot is as small as about
one cubic centimeter in size and very high in
sophistication and it is found that not only its
handling requires circumspection but also there are
rooms for improvement with respect to the operationality
and moving performance of the micro robot.Then, it is the usual practice so that generally a
plastic container or the like is used for the packaging
of a small and precision article and the article proper,
its various components (where the components permit to
