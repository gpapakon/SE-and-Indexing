<ABSTRACT>
The catalyst system for an exhaust from an internal combustion 
engine has at least two valve controlled exhaust outlet ports for 

each cylinder. A first catalyst bed (1) is adapted to interact 
selectively with the entire exhaust gas of the engine. A second 

catalyst bed (8) is disposed at a located closer to the engine 
exhaust than the first catalyst bed (1). Output of the second 

catalyst bed (8) is passed to the exhaust from said engine at a 
point prior to its input to the first catalyst bed (1).

 
Inlet to the second catalyst bed (8) is from one of the exhaust 

outlet ports which is so controlled as to allow exhaust gas flow 
preferentially during a predetermined time. Other of the exhaust 

outlet ports of each cylinder are so controlled as to allow 
exhaust gas flow at other predetermined times directly to the 

first catalyst bed (1) along such a flow path as to avoid the 
second catalyst bed (8). The system allows rapid catalytic 

conversion of exhaust gases upon start up of the engine but 
prevents overheating and therefore deterioration of the initially 

used converter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst system for an 
internal combustion engine. More particularly but not 
exclusively it relates to a selective catalyst system for use 
during an initial start-up period of engine operation. It is known to pass exhaust gases from an internal combustion 
engine over or through a catalyst bed to remove noxious gases, 
such as nitrogen oxides, unburnt hydrocarbons and carbon 
monoxide, and thereby to reduce pollution generally from internal 
combustion engine exhaust gases. However, it is also well known that catalysis is most effective 
when the catalyst bed reaches a certain temperature. This 
temperature is usually achieved by heat transfer from the hot 
gases being catalytically converted to less noxious gases and/or 
from heat generated during conversion. Hence cold-start conditions of engine operation tend to emit a 
greater amount of pollution than steady-state conditions, 
assuming an existing catalyst system is employed. A disadvantage is that the catalyst chemistry and/or the 
substrate structure may be damaged by high temperatures such as 
may be experienced close to the engine at high speeds and loads, 
and it is generally necessary to separate the catalyst bed from 
the engine, whereby the exhaust gas is cooled to an acceptable 
level. However, this means that the catalyst bed takes longer 
to reach an optimum operating temperature. Such a remote catalyst bed may be heated electrically but this 
can prove a drain of a battery or batteries of the car. It has been proposed to employ an additional catalyst bed which 
may be electrically heated (in some cases, either preheated or  
 
with the heater switching on immediately after use of the starter 
motor and switching out at a predetermined time thereafter). 
The predetermined time is such that the temperature of the 
catalyst bed may be maintained by the heat of the exhaust gases. Another suggestion is to provide a close coupled catalyst bed, 
i.e. one close to the engine. However, the temperature of the 
exhaust gases may soon cause the working temperature of the bed 
to become so high as to reduce the effectiveness of the catalyst, 
and may cause permanent deterioration thereof. Hence, after a period, the exhaust gases need to bypass such a 
close coupled bed. In this time, the heat of the exhaust gases 
should have raised the temperature of a main catalyst bed so that 
it is effective. However diversion of the exhaust gases around such a close 
coupled starter catalyst bed to pass directly to a main
