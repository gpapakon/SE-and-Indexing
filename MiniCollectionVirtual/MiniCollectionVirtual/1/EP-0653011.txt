<ABSTRACT>
A lock device which comprises (a) a lock comprising a hasp (14), and a body (12) which contains a lock mechanism and which has two openings formed in it for receiving the ends of the hasp (14) which can be retained in the openings by the lock mechanism when the lock is in a locked condition; (b) a pin element (8) which has at least one recess (20) formed in it extending around at least part of its periphery for receiving the hasp (14) in it; and (c) a protective casing (4) which has at least one pin element opening (6) through which the pin element (8) can be inserted into the casing (4), and a compartment (10) in which the lock can be located, the pin element opening (6) and the compartment (10) being so aligned that the hasp (14) on the lock can engage the recess (20) in the pin element (8) when it is inserted into the casing (4) and so prevent withdrawal of the pin element (8) from the casing (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lock device and to objects with 
which the lock device can be used. A padlock comprises a hasp, and a body which contains a lock 
mechanism and which has two openings formed in it for receiving 
the ends of the hasp which can be retained in the openings by 
the lock mechanism when the padlock is in a locked condition. 
Such locks are particularly vulnerable to attack by damage to 
the hasp, for example using bolt cutters or a saw. US-4883294 discloses a locking device in which a padlock is 
retain in an enclosure. The enclosure has openings in its 
walls through which a deadbolt can pass. The deadbolt has a 
notch formed in it for receiving the body of a padlock when the 
padlock is in its locked condition. When in this condition, 
the deadbolt cannot be slid out of the housing. The device disclosed in US-4883294 has the disadvantage that 
force applied to the deadbolt relative to the enclosure can 
damage the padlock, making it difficult then to release the 
deadbolt from the enclosure.  
 The lock device of US-A-4538827, which is considered to be the closest prior art, has the advantage that, in 
the event that force is applied to the pin element relative to 
the casing to damage the lock, the component of the lock that 
is damaged is the hasp rather than the body with the locking 
mechanism inside. This can mean that the locking mechanism can 
still function after the damage. The object of the present invention is thereby to provide a lock device, which is easy to use, and which increases the security. Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a lock device according to claim 1. A significant advantage of the device according to the invention is that, by 
appropriate selection of the pin element and the lock, the lock 
in its protective casing can be allowed to rotate around the 
pin element. This can facilitate closing of the lock since the 
hasp can be made to drop into and out of the body of the lock 
under force of gravity, according to the orientation of the 
lock. Either or both of the arms may be released entirely from the 
openings, for example for rotation of the hasp relative to the 
body. In many situations, however, the arms of the hasp will 
move in directions into and out of the lock body, while not 
necessarily moving entirely out of the body. The hasp 
comprises two generally parallel arms, joined by a base 
portion, and frequently will be generally U-shaped.  
 With the pin element approximately circular in cross-section 
and the hasp comprising

<CLAIMS>
A lock device which comprises: 

(a) a lock (12) comprising a hasp (14), having two 
generally parallel limbs joined by a rounded base portion, and 

a body which contains a lock mechanism and which has two 
openings formed in it for receiving the ends of the hasp (14), 

which can be retained in the openings by the lock mechanism 
(12) when the lock (12) is in a locked condition; 
(b) a pin element (8, 40, 56, 66) which has at least 
one recess (20) formed therein for reception of the hasp (14) in it ; 
(c) a protective casing (4) which has at least one pin 
element opening (6) through which the pin element (8, 40, 56, 

66) can be inserted into the casing (4), and a compartment in 
which the lock (12) can be located, the pin element opening (6) 

and the compartment being so aligned that the hasp (14) on the 
lock can engage the recess (20) in the pin element (8, 40, 56, 

66) when it is inserted into the casing (4) and so prevent 
withdrawal of the pin element (8, 40, 56, 66) from the casing 

(4), wherein the body portion of the lock (12) is adapted to fit 
into the compartment (10) of the casing (4) such that the body 

portion of the lock (12) is removably retained in the casing 

(4) ; 
 
characterised in that the recess (20) extends 

substantially around the entire periphery of the pin element 
(8, 40, 56, 66) and is adapted to be engaged by the hasp (14) 

at least on substantially opposite sides of the pin element. 
A lock device as claimed in claim 1, in which the 
pin element (8, 40, 56, 66) is approximately circular in cross-section. 
A lock device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in 
which the casing (4) has a single pin element opening (6) 

formed in it so that the free end of the pin element (8, 40, 
56, 66) cannot pass through the casing (4). 
A lock device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3, in which the casing (4) is formed from a block of material.  

 
A lock device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
4, in which the lock (12) is retained in the compartment by 

retaining means (16). 
A lock device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
5, in which the recess (20,60) is spaced from the end of the 

pin element (8,40,56,66). 
A lock device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
6, in which the recess (20) is a groove defined axially of the 

pin element (8,66) by two spaced apart axially facing surfaces. 
A lock device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
7, in which the pin element (8) has a plurality of recesses 

(20) formed in it each recess (20) of the pine element (8) 
extending around at least part of its periphery. 
The use of locking device as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 8, for immobilising a wheel (36), the wheel (36) 

having an aperture extending through it, and in which the pin 
element (40) extends through the said opening, one end (42) of 

the pin element (40) being engaged by the lock (44) with the 
associated protective casing, and the other end of the pin 

element (40) projecting radially beyond the outermost point of 
the wheel (36) and any tyre (32,34) provided on it. 
The use of a locking device as claimed in any one 
of claims 1 to 8 for use with a pair of objects (52,54) which 

are movable relative to one another and which are locked to one 
another so as to restrict such relative movement and wherein 

the pin element is connected to one of the objects (52,54), and 
the protective casing is connected to the other of the objects. 
The use of a locking device as claimed in claim 10, 
in which the lock (58) is retained in the compartment by a 

retaining device, the retaining device being made inaccessible 
by one or both of the objects (52,54) when they are locked to
