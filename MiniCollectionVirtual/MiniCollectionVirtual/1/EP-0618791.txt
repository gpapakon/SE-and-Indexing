A process for the preparation of solid complex particles each composed of at 
least two solid substances of which at least one is biologically active , wherein 

said biologically active substance is composed of at least one biologically active 
product and is regularly distributed on the surface of a grain constituted by the 

other solid substance thus forming a core , called support substance, characterised 
in that the grains of the support substance are dispersed to give a size between 0.3 

and 30 microns in a liquid containing at least one biologically active substance be 
it in solution or be it in suspension in which particles of said biologically active 

substance have an average size less than or equal to 0.2 times the average size of 
the support substance particles , and in that the weight ratio between said active 

substance and said support substance ranges between 10
-4
 and 1.5 in order to 
obtain a suspension of the support substance in said liquid, then said suspension 

is atomised in order to obtain a powder of particles consisting of grains of support 
substance uniformly coated with the biologically active substance. 
Process according to Claim 1 , wherein : 

1. A suspension of particles of support substances is achieved in a liquid 
containing at least one dissolved biologically active substance , said liquid not 

being a solvent of the support substance . 
2. Said suspension is pulverised by injecting it into an atomiser wherein the 
atomisation is achieved at a temperature at least equal to the boiling point of the 

solvent and less than the softening point of said support substance. 
Process according to claim 1 , wherein : 

1. A suspension of particles of support substance is achieved in a liquid 
containing at least one biologically active substance in the form of a dispersion of 

particles of average size less than or equal to about 0.2 times the average size of 
the support substance particles , said liquid not being a solvent of the support 

substance. 
2. Said suspension is pulverised by injecting it into an atomiser where 
atomisation is achieved at a temperature at least equal to the boiling point of the 

solvent and less than the softening point of the support substance . 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3 , characterised in that the weight ratio 
between the active substance and the support substance lies between 10
-4
 and 0.35 . 
Process according to Claims 1 to 4 ,characterised in that said grains forming the 
core are in the form of spheres , disks , cubes , platelets , or grains of any irregular 

form . 
Process according to Claims 1 to 5 ,characterised in that the support substance 
is a solid selected from the group consisting of synthetic polymers solid at room 

temperature , such as polyamides , polyethylene , polystyrene , polyacrylates , 
polymethacrylates , minerals such as talc , mica , sericite , vermiculite , pigments 

such as titanium oxide , iron oxides , organic substances sparingly water soluble 
such as lauryl - lysine , inorganic or vegetable waxes , natural polymers such as 

cellulose, natural particles such as walls of yeasts or euglene. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6 , characterised in that the active 
product is selected from the group consisting of derivatives , for example 

phosphates of vitamin E or vitamin C , tocopherol succinates polyoxyethylenated 
or not , glycyrrhizinic acid its salts and its solid esters , pulverulent vegetable 

extracts , kojic acid , ecdysteroids , econazole , minoxidil , solid bactericides for 
deodourants . 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7 , characterised in that the suspension 
introduced into the atomiser contains in addition a product that favours wetting 

and / or the dispersion of the particles in suspension . 
Process according to one of Claims 7 or 8 , characterised in that the product to 
be atomised contains in addition different additives such as colourants , agents 

that modify the complex particles' surface properties , preservatives. 
Complex particles susceptible of being obtained by the procedure of one of the 
Claims 1 to 9 . 
Use of solid complex particles susceptible of being obtained by the procedure 
of one of Claims 1 to 9 for the preparation of a composition for treating a  

 
biological surface such as the skin , integuments in particular hair, lashes , nails , 

or aerial parts of plants in particular leaves and stems , notably by application on 
said biological surface with the aim of accelerating the bioavailability of the active 

substance towards said biological surface. . 
Powder consisting of particles according to Claim 10. 
Composition for topical use for the treatment of a biological surface such as 
the skin , integuments in particular hair, lashes , nails , or aerial p
arts of plants in 
particuliar leaves and stems ,characterised in that it contains particles according to 

Claim 10 . 
Composition according to Claim13 characterised in that it is in the solid state. 
Composition according to Claim 13 characterised in that it is in liquid form 
and that the complex particles are not dissolved by other constituents of the 

composition.
