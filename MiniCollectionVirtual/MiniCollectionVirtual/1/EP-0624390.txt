<ABSTRACT>
A fleece filter belt is made of non-woven thermally-activated fibres. The novelty is that the belt is self-supporting, 0.15 to 0.50 mm thick, and has a weight of 30 g/m2 to 100 g/m2; further that the fleece is 55 to 100 percent core/mantle fibre by weight or incorporates filaments, and that the mantle material has a lower softening range than does the core material; further that the other fibres in the fleece are not thermally activated and are homophilic at temperatures in the softening range of the core/mantle fibre material; further that the fleece is secured within itself with mono or multi filaments 5g/m2 to 30 g/m2 in warp and weft.

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing a nonwoven filter belt 
from a fibre web of 30 g/m
2
 to 100 g/m
2
 containing 55 to 100% 
by weight of core-sheath fibres or filaments, the sheath 

material having a softening range below that of the core 
material and any other fibres present being homofil and not 

activable at temperatures around the softening range of the 
sheath material, wherein the fibre web is consolidated from 

both sides with high-energy water jets which have a diameter 
of about 100 Âµm and a pressure around 100 bar coupled with 

a jet density of from 250/cm, characterized in that, in a 
subsequent operation, the nonwoven has incorporated into it, 

by means of a Raschel machine and warp-knitting, in an 
amount of 5 to 30 g/m
2
 in both the longitudinal and the 
transverse direction, high-tenacity mono- or multifilaments 

that do not soften in the subsequent thermal treatment, and 
in that, in a third operation, the nonwoven thus reinforced 

is treated in a heating oven and guided therein under light 
pressure during or directly after the heat treatment wherein 

the sheath material reaches its softening temperature, 
thereby creating an intimate, melting bond between fibres 

and filaments and a surface free of protruding fibres.
