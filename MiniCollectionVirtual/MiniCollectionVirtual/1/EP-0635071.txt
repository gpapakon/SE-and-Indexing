<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and device for relably preventing the contamination of the tapping steel from a converter by flush slag. To this end a plastic, deformable plug (1, 8) of fireproof material containing silicate and oxide components and a suitable binder is used. The plug (1, 8) is inserted with the aid of a fitting device into the tapping until its front surface closed off by a cone-shaped crush-plate (2, 5) is virtually flush with the inside of the converter, on being crushed completely fills the diameter of the tapping aperture (10) and thus provides a plane such that the flush slag is reliably guided over the tapping when the converter is tipped. Owing to the process used, the novel plastic plug (1, 8) fits a wide range of tapping aperture diameters. The plug (1, 8) is rapidly removed by the molten steel flowing off through the cone channel (5) so that the steel flows into the tapping pan.

Device for sealing the taphole of a tiltable converter with a sealing plug (8), 
which is made of a heat-resistant material, a faceplate (2) directed towards 

the inside of the converter (9), which melts on contact with liquid steel and a 
jigging device, by which the sealing plug (8) can be inserted into the 

taphole (10) and can be moulded therein against its wall, whereby the sealing 
plug (8) comprises a cylindrical, plastic core (1) ) covered by a faceplate (2) 

and a base plate (4), which are connected with the jigging 
device displaceably towards one another,
characterised in that
 
the faceplate (2) is designed passing into a funnel channel (5) which 

penetrates the sealing plug or core (1) and is designed to receive a drawing 
claw (6) acting on the faceplate. 
Device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the cylindrical core (1) is made of a fire-retardant with a grain size of 


below
 3 mm, binding agents, liquefiers and plasticizers. 
Device according to Claim 2
characterised in that
 
the cylindrical core (1) comprises as a fire-retardant a mixture of 


 
and has a density of 0.8 - 0.9 kg/dm³. 
Device according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 
the permanent binding agents are silicates, the temporary binding agents - 

cellulose-material, the plasticizers - polyelectrolyte alcohols and the liquefiers 
fatty acids. 
Device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the faceplate (2) is funnel-shaped and convex towards the smaller opening 

and the smaller opening is designed to exit into the funnel channel (5). 
Device according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 
the funnel channel (5) is designed passing over the baseplate (4) and into the 

jigging device. 
Device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the funnel channel (5) with a taphole diameter of 20 cm has a diameter of 25 

to 38 mm. 
Process for operating a converter and for the even and slag-free removal of 
the liquid steel, whereby a sealing plug made of plastic is inserted into the 

taphole connecting the inner wall and outer wall up to the height of the 
inner wall of the converter in the taphole and is then moulded by means of a 

jigging device from its side averted from the inner wall and also from its side 
facing the inner wall until it fits tightly against the hole wall, the sealing plug  

 
is positioned by means of the jigging device in the transition zone in relation 

to the converter inner chamber opening a funnel channel passing 
therethrough by squeezing, whereby the plastic material of the plug made of 


20 to 40 wt. %
insulating aluminosilicate 
20 to 40 wt. %
binding clay 
0 to 30 wt. %
water 
5 to 20 wt. %
mineral oil 
0.1 to 3 wt. %
plasticizer, e.g polyelectrolyte alcohols 
0.1 to 2 wt. %
liquefier, e.g. fatty acid 
0.1 to 2 wt. %
temporary binding agent, e.g. cellulose and 
0.1 to 5 wt. %
permanent binding agent, e.g. silicates, 
 
is mixed to form a fire-retardant with a density of 0.8 to 0.9 kg/dm³, formed into 

a cylindrical body and is then penetrated by the funnel channel of a funnel-shaped 
squeezer plate, fitted onto the jigging device, inserted into the taphole 

and secured.
