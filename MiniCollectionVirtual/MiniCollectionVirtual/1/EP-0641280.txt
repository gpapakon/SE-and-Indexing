<ABSTRACT>
A curtain wall for buildings consists of two sheet metal plates (1, 2) interconnected by an elastic layer (1.1, 2.1). In order to obtain a fireproof, sound-absorbing, easy to recycle curtain wall, which may further be bent and embossed without mechanical machining operations, at least one of the plates (1, 2) is made of zinc and an elastomer (1.1, 2.1) vulcanized on the sheet metal plates (1, 2) is used as bonding material.

<CLAIMS>
Curtain wall for buildings, which consists of two
metal sheets joined by a resilient layer, having an

elastomer as the bonding material, characterised in that
at least one of the two metal sheets (1, 2) consists of

zinc and the elastomer (1.1, 2.1) serving as the bonding
material is vulcanised on to the metal sheets.
Curtain wall according to claim 1, characterised in
that, between the elastomer layers (1.1, 1.2) vulcanised

onto the sheets (1, 2), there is a layer of woven fabric
(3), preferably consisting of polyamide, which absorbs

gas bubbles during the vulcanisation process.
Curtain wall according to claim 1, characterised in
that the suspension brackets or frames (4) are attached

to the elastomer layer (1.1, 1.2) by vulcanisation.
Curtain wall according to claim 1, characterised in
that it is shaped by a stamping operation during the

manufacturing process.
