<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a guide-rail arrangement for a winter-garden awning or the like, an awning canvas being arranged on an awning-canvas winding shaft and the front end of the awning canvas being provided with an opening-out profile which is guided, on both sides, in in each case one guide rail and is retained in a stressed state by means of a positive-return system, and the guide rails extending perpendicularly with respect to the awning-canvas winding shaft and being retained, by retaining devices, at a distance from a surface which is to be shaded, such as the glass roof of a winter garden. In order to achieve a possibility for fastening independently of the respective distance and inclination angle between roof and guide rail, the invention provides that the retaining arrangement (11) exhibits two retaining legs (13, 14) which are connected pivotably to one another and to a fastening part (12), can pivot about a horizontal pivot axis (10), and on whose free ends there are, in turn, arranged connecting parts (21, 22) which can pivot about a horizontal pivot axis and are displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the guide rails (9) and are connected thereto.

A guide bar arrangement for an awning (1) for winter gardens or the 
like, an awning fabric being arranged on a fabric shaft, each side of said 

fabric being guided via a guide bar (9) and being held under tension by the 
aid of a back tension system, and the guide bars (9) extending perpendicular 

to the fabric shaft and being held by supporting arrangements (11) at a 
distance from an area to be shaded, such as the glass roof (2) of a winter 

garden, 
characterized in that
 the front end of the awning fabric is provided 
with a drop-out profile, each side of which is guided on a guide bar (9) and 

in that the supporting arrangement (11) is provided with two supporting 
legs (13, 14) which are pivotably connected with each other and with a fastening 

member (12) and on the free ends of which connecting pieces (21, 
22) are arranged to be pivotable about a horizontal pivot axis, said connecting 

pieces (21, 22) being displaceably connected with the guide bars 
(9) in the latter's longitudinal direction. 
A guide bar arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the connecting pieces (21, 22) are provided with rand-type projections (25), 

an enlarged end of which engages with a type of clamping groove (26) on 
the guide bar in a manner longitudinally displaceable, but substantially free 

from play in the direction perpendicular to the guide bar (9). 
A guide bar arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
the guide bars (9) are single-piece profile bars, a guide recess (27) for the 

drop-out profile being arranged in a manner open laterally in the installed 
condition and the clamping groove (26) for the connecting pieces (21, 22)  

 
being arranged in a manner displaced inwards by 90Â° in relation thereto in 

the installed condition. 
A guide bar arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the fastening members (21, 22) are in the shape of an L-profile, one leg 

of the L (18) comprising a drilled hole for the support of the supporting 
legs (16, 17) by the aid of a screw-nut-arrangement (16, 17) and the 

other leg of the L (19) comprising drilled holes for fastening screws 
(29). 
A guide bar arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the guide bars (9) are arranged above an area to be shaded, i.e. a 
roof (2) of a winter garden, the gravity of the guide bars (9) causing 

clamping and arrest of the connecting pieces (21, 22) or of the supporting 
legs (13, 14), respectively. 
A guide bar arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the connecting pieces (21, 22) comprise arresting devices, such as 
arresting screws or the like, for being arrested in the clamping groove 

(26).
