<CLAIMS>
Construction vehicle comprising an integral vehicle frame (18) and two 
wheel axles, at least one of which having wheels steerable by steering 

knuckles, and comprising a working implement supported by the vehicle 
frame (18) within the zone of the other wheel axle, for example loader chassis 

for a lifting frame having a loading tool, or support frame for the boom 
bracket of a backhoe excavator,
characterized in
 
that the working implement is adjustable about a vertical pivot axis (36) 

mounted on the vehicle frame and is at least indirectly connected to a 
steering device for the wheels of the other wheel axle by means of coupling 

means for adjustment of pivot or steering angles of same direction and magnitude. 
Construction vehicle according to claim 1, characterized in that the other 
wheel axle also carries wheels steerable by steering knuckles, and in that the 

coupling means comprise a hydraulic follower control between an adjustment 
servo-cylinder (52) of the steering device and a hydraulically operated 

pivot drive of the working implement. 
Construction vehicle according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
pivot drive comprises two cylinders (42, 44) articulated to the working implement 

and to the vehicle frame (18) and disposed at both sides of the 
longitudinal center axis thereof.  

 
Construction vehicle according to claim 3, characterized in that both pivot 
cylinders (42, 44) are each connected at both ends by connection pipes (50, 

54) to a rotary valve (56) and to one end, respectively, of the adjustment 
servo-cylinder (52) of the steering device having a passing-through piston 

rod. 
Construction vehicle according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the working implement (26) by means of rearwardly extending 

connecting members (28, 30) is pivotally mounted about the vertical pivot 
axis (36) supported on a pivot bracket (22) fixedly secured to the frame (18). 
Construction vehicle according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the pivot bracket (22) comprises a vertical cross wall (46) fixed 

to the frame (18) and rearwardly projecting stiffening plates (48), to which 
the cylinders (42, 44) acting on the working implement or loader chassis 

(26) are articulated. 
Construction vehicle according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the working implement forming the loader chassis (26) is arranged on 

a slewing track ring (60) supported by the vehicle frame (18) in the zone 
above the front axle, the vertical pivot axis (36) of which ring being disposed 

forwardly of the loader chassis and between the arms of the lifting frame 
(16). 
Construction vehicle according to claim 1 or 7, characterized in that an 
angle or path sensor (80) measuring the steering adjustment of the wheels of 

the other wheel axle and an angle or path sensor (90) measuring the pivotal  
 

adjustment of the working implement are connected to a synchronizing adjustment 
device including a computerized comparator adapted to be disconnected 

by means of a switch (82) in order to achieve swivelling of the working 
implement or loader chassis (26) independent from steering adjustment. 
Construction vehicle according to claim 1, characterized in that the coupling 
means comprise a fixed connection between the working implement 

and the other wheel axle carrying non-steerable wheel and disposed at one 
end of the vehicle frame, wherein the vertical pivot axis (36) extends 

through the point of intersection between the longitudinal center line of the 
vehicle frame (18) and the center line of the wheel axle, such that the pivot 

drive of the working implement at the same time constitutes the steering device 
of the other wheel axle and vize versa, respectively. 
Construction vehicle according to claim 9, characterized in that the other 
wheel axle is fixedly secured to a connecting frame (94) integral with the 

working implement, which by means of an upper and a lower section (96, 
100) is pivotally mounted to an articulation shaft disposed at the vehicle 

frame's end and forming the vertical pivot axis. 
Construction vehicle according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the 
wheel axle is disposed within a vertical distance between upper and lower 

horizontal end members (86, 88) of the vehicle frame, which carry an upper 
and a lower articulation shaft fo mounting the upper and lower sections (96, 

100) of the connection frame. 
Construction vehicle according to one of the claims 9 to 11, characterized 
in that the connection frame (94) consists of an about rectangular housing  

 
open at least at one side thereof and including inner braced supporting 

members (90) for mounting the wheel axle and with its upper and lower 
sections (96, 100) being pivotally mounted to the articulation shafts of the 

upper and lower end members (86, 88) of the vehicle frame. 
Construction vehicle according to one of the claims 9 to 12, characterized 
in that the other wheel axle is a drive axle preferably in the form of a 

driven gantry axle having a differential gear (84), which is disposed within 
the vertical spacing between the upper and lower articulation shafts (104, 

106) associated to the upper and lower end members (86, 88), respectively, 
of the vehicle frame. 
Construction vehicle according to claim 9, characterized in that the other 
wheel axle is fixedly secured to a connection frame integral with the working 

implement and at its upper side being connected to the vehicle frame by 
means of an annular pivot bearing havin
g a vertical pivot axis. 
Construction vehicle according to claim 9 or 14, characterized in that the 
connection frame on a section having a width at least corresponding to the 

diameter of the pivot bearing comprises lower fixation means for the other 
wheel axle, and at a section projecting beyond the end of the vehicle frame 

carries the working implement, the support frame for the boom bracket of a 
rearwardly disposed excavator, for example.
