<ABSTRACT>
The buckle according to the invention comprises, 
in a shell (11), a carriage (15) slidable in a box-shaped 

casing (14) between a rest position and an operating 
position; opposing means (16) movable with respect to the 

said carriage (15) and opposing the simultaneous insertion 
into the casing (14) of two tongues (12) connected 

to corresponding portions of the seat belt, but not 
opposing the insertion of one tongue (12) only; a spring 

bolt (17), kept in the rest position by the said carriage 
(15), a catch lever (17.4) connected to the said bolt 

(17) to keep a release button (18) depressed in a corresponding 
aperture of the shell (11), when the bolt (17) 

is in the rest position, so that the released condition 
of the buckle is indicated visually to the user. 
The two tongues (12) inserted simultaneously into 
the casing (14) engage the opposing means (16) and cause 

the carriage (15) to move, thus releasing the bolt (17) 
which locks the tongues. This does not happen when only 

one tongue (12) is inserted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a seat belt buckle with 
three branches, for example for a safety seat for 
children carried in cars. Seat belt buckles with three branches of the type 
specified above are known. One known buckle is fixed to one end of one 
branch of a seat belt which is made to pass between the 
legs of a child who is carried in a car and seated in a 
safety seat. The other two branches of the seat belt are 
disposed in the form of braces on the body of the seated 
child and each of them carries, fixed to its free end, a 
rigid tongue, made for example of metal, which is selectively 
inserted into and fixed in the buckle to form a 
substantially Y-shaped set of straps capable of securing 
the body of the child carried in the car with respect to 
the seat. The branches of the belt are made to open by 
unlocking the tongues from the buckle by means of a push 
button provided in the buckle. However, in known buckles of the specified type 
it is impossible to determine with certainty the safe 
condition in which the tongues are securely locked in the 
buckle. Moreover, the known buckles are complicated and 
frequently unreliable. The principal object of the present invention is 
to provide a seat belt buckle with three branches, for 
example for a safety seat for children carried in cars, 
which can be used to secure a child carried in a car with 
respect to the seat in a rapid and certain way, while 
also making the safe condition visible when it is present. A further object is to provide a seat belt buckle 
as indicated which has a simplified structure, operates 
in a certain and reliable way and is relatively inexpensive. To attain these objects, the present invention  
 
provides a seat belt buckle with three branches, for 
example for a safety seat for children carried in cars, 
whose essential characteristic forms the subject of the 
principal claim which shall be understood to be provided 
as an integral part of this document. Further advantageous characteristics are 
described in the dependent claims which shall also be 
understood to be provided as an integral part of this 
document. The present invention will be described in detail 
in the following text with reference to the attached 
drawings, provided solely by way of example and without 
restriction, in which: 
Fig. 1 is an elevation of the seat belt buckle with 
three branches, for example for a safety seat for 
children carried in cars, according to the present 
invention, in which two branches of the seat belt, to be

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Seat belt buckle with three branches, in which a 
spring lock (13) is fixed in a shell (11) provided with 

at least one aperture (11.5) for the free passage of 
corresponding portions (12.1) of two rigid fixing tongues 

(12) of two branches of the seat belt, the said portions 
of tongues (12.1) having to be correctly placed adjacent 

and parallel to each other and with their corresponding 
engagement notches (12.2) opposite each other, and in 

which the said lock (13) is provided with a box-shaped 
casing (14), having at least one aperture (14.3) corresponding 

to the said at least one aperture (11.5) of the 
shell (11) for the free passage of the said portions 

(12.1) of the tongues (12), characterized in that the 
said spring lock (13) comprises: 


a carriage (15) housed in the said box-shaped casing 
(14) and slidable between a rest position and an operating 

position, remote from the said at least one aperture 
(14.3), the said carriage (15) being normally maintained 

in its said rest position by elastic return means (15.2); 
opposing means (16, 21), supported movably with 
respect to the said carriage (15) and disposed so that 

they oppose the insertion through the said box-shaped 
casing (14) of the said portions (12.1) of the tongues 

(12), if correctly placed adjacent to each other to form 
a pair, while the said opposing means (16, 21) do not 

oppose the insertion of only one of the said portions 
(12.1) of tongues through the said box-shaped casing 

(14), yielding to its thrust by a relative movement with 
respect to the said carriage (15); 
a spring bolt (17), pressed - for example in a 
direction substantially orthogonal to the said carriage 

(15) - by elastic means (17.3) and kept retracted, in 
opposition to the action of the said elastic means 

(17.3), by the carriage (15) when the carriage is disposed 
in its said rest position; 
a catch lever (17.4), for example a substantially 
V-shaped lever, effectively connected to the said bolt 

 
(17) so that it has one en
d (17.6) lowered in the said 
shell (11) when the said bolt (17) is kept retracted by 

the said carriage (15) in its said rest position; 
a release button (18) fitted movably and guided - 
for example in a direction substantially orthogonal to 

the said carriage (15) - in an aperture (18.1) of the 
said shell (11) opposite the said end (17.6) of the catch 

lever (17.4) so that it is depressed in the said aperture, 
when the said bolt (17) is kept retracted by the 

said carriage (15) in its said rest position, so that 
when the said portions (12.1) of the two tongues (12) are 

inserted simultaneously through the said box-shaped 
casing (14) and are correctly placed adjacent to each 

other with the engagement notches (12.2) opposite each 
other the said opposing means (16) transmit their thrust 

to the carriage (15) which, by sliding into its said 
operating position, in opposition to the action of the 

said elastic return means (15.2), releases the bolt (17) 
which is elastically forced (by 17.3) to advance, locking 

the carriage (15) in the operating position, engaging the 
notches (12.2) of the tongues (12) and making the catch 

lever (17.4) oscillate so that its said end (17.6) is 
rotated upwards in the said shell (11), this action 

raising the button (18) in the said aperture (18.1) of 
the shell, while by pressing the said raised button (18) 

and therefore making the said lever (17.4) oscillate in 
the reverse direction, the bolt (17) is returned, causing 

it to be retracted in opposition to the elastic means 
(17.3), so that the carriage (15) is automatically 

returned to the rest position (by 15.2), and the button 
(18), remaining depressed in the aperture (18.1), indicates 

the released condition of the buckle; and so that 
the said carriage (15) also remains in its rest position 

when only one portion (12.1) of a tongue (12) is 
inserted, since the thrust of this portion causes a 

relative movement of the opposing means (16, 21) with 
respect to the carriage (15), without the sliding of the 

carriage into its said operating position. 
Buckle according to Claim 1, characterized in 
 

that the said opposing means (16) comprise a strip (16.1) 
substantially in the form of half a circular ring with 

its free ends facing the said at least one aperture 
(14.3), this strip being fitted on the carriage (15) so 

that it can rotate at least partially about an axis 
substantially orthogonal to the carriage (15) and passing 

through the centre of the strip, each end of the said 
strip (16.1) being capable of being engaged by one of the 

said portions (12.1) of the tongues (12) during insertion 
into the said casing (14). 
Buckle according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the said opposing means (21) comprise a rocker (22), 

fitted so that it can oscillate on the carriage (15) by 
means of an intermediate pin (23) with its axis substantially 

orthogonal to the carriage, each end of the said 
rocker (22) being capable of being engaged by one of the 

said portions (12.1) of the tongues (12) during insertion 
into the said casing (14).
