<ABSTRACT>
Modules clear of the ground each have four support feet (17) and a flat concrete roof, and are mounted alongside and one above the other. Adjacent roofs are joined by filigree plates, over which concrete is poured on site. On the modules roof is a reinforced frame (24) open at the sides and extending at least part of the way round the periphery. This is secured at heads (18) on the feet and which protrude above the roof. The frame components can be welded to the reinforcing cages in the heads, or embedded in the concrete of the latter, and also secured to the roof. In addition to the lengthwise frame bars (25) absorbing compression and tension loads, there can be transverse reinforcing members (26) secured to the reinforcing components in the roof.

A method of producing pre-fabricated modules standing clear of the ground and comprising 
at least support legs (14a, 14b, 14c, 14d) and a concrete floor (12), for erecting 

structures and buildings, in particular hotels, hospitals, business premises or office buildings, 
residential buildings, old-peoples' homes and the like, wherein the spatial cells 

formed by modules are arranged side by side and one above the other and are joined to 
one another by applying a site-mixed concrete layer (
H1
) which in each case covers 
upper adjacent module floors and, where present, connecting floors arranged between the 

individual modules and acting as bridges between the concrete floors, 
characterized in 
that
 an at least partially continuous reinforcement frame (24) - open at the side for the 
passage of reinforcement bars engaging over adjacent modules for the site-mi
xed concrete 
layer - is laid on the concrete floor (12) - free from raised boundary edges - of 

each individual module on the side of the boundary edges. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each leg support comprises a 
head plate (15), in the region of which vertically displaceable and thus adjustable plates 

or support seats are arranged, the upper edges of which simultaneously define the screed 
plane for the site-mixed concrete layer to be applied and the leg supports of which are 

used to support further modules attached to one another at the top. 
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 threaded guide bushes (30), into 
which a head plate (32) supported by a threaded foot (31) is screwed and is adjusted vertically, 

are provided in the region of each head plate. 
A method according to one of Claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
, in order to anchor a 
site-mixed concrete layer to be applied subsequently, the concrete floor (12) of each individual 

module is provided with upwardly projecting reinforcement-bar members (19), 
and the laid reinforcement frame (24) is secured at least in the head areas of the leg supports 

(14a, 14b, 14c, 14d) projecting beyond the concrete floor, which also supports the 
vertically displaceable head plates. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcement 
members of the reinforcement frame (24) are connected, and preferably welded, to the 

reinforcement cages of the head parts (18) of the support legs, and/or are embedded in 
the concrete of the head parts (18).  

 
A method according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcement members of the 
reinforcement frame (24) are also connected outside the head parts (18) of the support 

legs to the concrete-floor layer of the module. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
, in addition to longitudinal 
rods (25) of the reinforcement frame (24) which absorb the actions of thrust and 

traction, interconnecting reinforcement members (26) are provided, which are connected 
at least in part in the concrete floor (12) of each module and to the reinforcement 

members (19) there. 
A pre-fabricated module for producing structures and buildings, in particular hotels, 
hospitals, business premises or office buildings, residential buildings and old-peoples' 

homes and the like, which comprises at least support legs (14a, 14b, 14c, 14d) and a concrete 
floor (12) and which can be connected to further modules or intermediate plates 

(20) arranged at the side as well as above and below, 
characterized by
 an at least partially 
continuous reinforcement frame (24) which connects together head parts (18) of 

support legs (14a, 14b, 14c, 14d) projecting beyond the concrete floor (12) and which 
comprises openings traversable at the side. 
A pre-fabricated module according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcement 
frame (24) is arranged at the boundary edge in a closed form at the level of the head parts 

(18) and is connected to the head parts (18) as well as to the concrete floor (12) between 
the said head parts (18). 
A pre-fabricated module according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that
 the continuous 
reinforcement frame (24) comprises longitudinal rods (25) which are effective against the 

action of thrust and traction and which are connected to one another by way of additional 
reinforcement members (26) extending in any direction, wherein the reinforcement 

members of the reinforcement frame (24) are connected, and preferably welded, to the 
reinforcement members of reinforcement cages in the head parts (18) and to the reinforcement 

members (19) of the concrete floor (12), and are anchored in the concrete of 
the head parts (18) with complete free lateral accessibility and in the concrete of the concrete 

floor (12) with partial free lateral accessibility. 
A pre-fabricated module according to one or more of Claims 8 to 10, 
characterized in 
that
 the reinforcement frame (24) comprises pre-fabricated concrete parts with internal 
reinforcement inlays, in the case of the possibility of lateral passage for reinforcements 

(27) which cover adjacent modules.  
 
A pre-fabricated module according to one or more of Claims 8 to 11, 
characterized in 
that
 vertically displaceable tie rods are provided in the region of the head plates or in the 
region of the support plates of each module. 
A pre-fabricated module according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 threaded guide 
bushes (30), which receive threaded feet (31) supporting head plates (32) vertically displaceable 

by way of a thread, are arranged in the leg supports for the sake of vertical displaceability 
in the region of the head plates. 
A pre-fabricated module according to Claim 12 or 13, 
characterized in that
 the site-mixed 
concrete is applied as far as the level of the upper edge of the head plates vertically 

adjusted beforehand.
