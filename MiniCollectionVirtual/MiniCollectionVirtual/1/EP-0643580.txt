<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical formulations comprising as active ingredients an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor at a dose level normally found effective as an antihypertensive and a diuretic at a dose level below its minimum effective dose, demonstrate greater efficacy than would be expected in returning the blood pressure of hypertensive patients to normotensive values.

'*•-- 1 -10 TITLE OF THE INVENTIONCOMBINATIONS OF ACE INHIBITORS AND DIURETICSBACKGROUN OF THE INVENTIONBoth diuretics and ACE-inhibitors have an15 effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ACE-inhibitors act by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Diuretics regulate the sodium-balance, and thereby also fluid volume. The decrease, both in sodium as well as volume,20 following therapy with diuretics increases plasma renin activity and thereby activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This effect will to some degree counteract the blood-pressure lowering effect of the diuretic. When a diuretic and25 an ACE-inhibitor are combined the different pharmacological actions of these two drugs will,30 

influence the effect of the other. There is accordingly a logical rationale for combining these two pharmacological principles.It is possihle to establish the highest non-pharmacological active dose of diuretic, i.e. a dose that is so low that it has no effect on blood pressure, and no apparent adverse effects. The highest non-effective dose of diuretic will still trigger the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and although it has no physiological effect of it's own, it will nonetheless have a potentiating effect on an ACE-inhibitor.In a recently completed study by us of the effects of different doses of HCTZ on blood pressure and various metabolic parameters, doses ranging from 3 mg to 25 mg were investigated. 25 mg HCTZ produced significant effects on blood pressure and the metabolic parameters. 12.5 mg of HCTZ was found to be at the threshold of an effective antihypertensive response, and changes were seen in the metabolic parameters. Contrary to this, the doses of 3 and 6 mg were demonstrated not to be different from placebo in effects on blood pressure and various metabolic parameters. Based on this study it can be concluded that6 mg has been established as the highest non- pharmacological dose of HCTZ.In a study by Andren et al. , J. Hypertension 1 (suppl. 2) 384-386 (1983)) doses of 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were combined with 10 and 40 mg of enalapril respectively. The authors concluded that: "the five combinations were equally effective in reducing blood pressure, and when given with enalapril the dose of HCTZ can be very low". When the Andren study was performed, it 

was not known by him that 6.25 mg is or is close to the non-pharmacological dose.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with pharmaceutical formulations for
