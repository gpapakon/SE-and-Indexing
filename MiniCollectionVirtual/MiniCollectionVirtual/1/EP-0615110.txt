<ABSTRACT>
A measuring device (M) which has exclusively rotary axes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is represented in Figure 4. Calibration surfaces (14 to 23) and balancing weights (24, 25, 26) are integrated in a particularly advantageous way in the swivel joints (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and the connecting elements (11, 12, 13) so as to increase the measurement accuracy. The parameters determined during a calibration are stored in the operating software.
