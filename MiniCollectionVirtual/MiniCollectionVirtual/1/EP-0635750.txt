<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel organic 
non-linear optical material for manufacturing various devices 
using non-linear optical effects. More particularly, it 
relates to a tertiary non-linear optical material preferably 
employed in various devices used in the fields of super-high 
speed optical information processing or optical communication 
using tertiary non-linear optical effects. The non-linear optical effect is, as expressed by 
the following equation (i), an optical effect that generates 
along with non-linearity occurred if a polarization P, which 
is induced by an electric field exerted within a crystal, is 
provided with second degree or higher degree terms.

P = X(1)E + X(2)E·E + X(3)E·E·E + ... X(n)En   (i) 


 
wherein X(n) is a non-linear sensitivity rate of n-th degree, 
and E is an electric field vector. As a secondary non-linear optical phenomenon 
observed on the non-linear optical material, there are second 
harmonic generation, optical rectification, optical mixing, 
parametric amplification, Pockels effect and the like. As the 
tertiary non-linear optical phenomenon, there are third 
harmonic generation, optical bistability, Kerr effect and the  
 
like. If the optical bistability is employed as a tertiary 
optical phenomenon, it is possible to obtain a device which 
can be a key device for the future optical information 
processing systems such as a high-speed light switch and an 
optical bistable device. Accordingly, research and 
development of non-linear optical materials has recently been 
prevalent. As a non-linear optical material showing optical 
bistability, there are known a semi-conductor with multiple-quantum 
well structure, a glass material wherein super-fine 
particles of semi-conductors (e.g. CuCl, CdS) are dispersed, 
an organic compound with π-electron conjugated system, among 
others [e.g. see Solid State Physics "Special Issue of Non-linear 
Optics", 24, (11), 1989]. Among those, the semi-conductors and the glass 
material, both of which employ non-linear optical effect due 
to optical absorption, exhibit a speed of response ranging 
from 10⁻⁸ to 10⁻¹¹ seconds, which is too slow to use as a 
device for super-high speed information processing. On the other hand, the organic compound utilizes 
non-linear optical effect due to pure electronic polarization, 
not due to optical absorption nor molecular rearrangement. 
Therefore, it exhibits a high speed of response ranging from 
10⁻¹² to 10⁻¹⁴ seconds, thus being a prospective material of a  
 
device used
