<ABSTRACT>
Granules collected from a solution of a polymer such 
as a polycarbonate, an integrated structure of independent 

fine particles constituting the granules being formed at 
least on the surfaces of the granules; and a process for 

preparing the granules of the polymer which comprises the 
steps of 
adding a poor solvent to the polymer solution, and 
then agitation-granulating fine particles of the polymer 

into the granules, while stirring involving a shear force-imparting 
function is carried out under heating. According 

to the present invention, the polymer can be collected from 
its organic solvent solution as the granules having good 

drying properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing polymer granules
having a specific outer surface shape collected from a
solvent solution of a polymer.
More specifically, it relates to a process for preparing spherical
polymer granules having a specific outer surface shape and
containing a less remaining solvent, particularly polycarbonate
granules.As means for collecting a solid polymer from its
organic solvent solution, various techniques have been
suggested and put to practical use. In particular, a
polycarbonate is usually manufactured by an interfacial
polycondensation method, and then often collected as a
solid polycarbonate in the form of fine particles, granules
formed by the gathering of these fine particles or the like
from its organic solvent solution. Most of the various
methods for collecting the solid polycarbonate which have
heretofore been proposed require specific devices, and so
there has not been developed a method for isolating and
collecting the solid polycarbonate at a low cost without
using the expensive devices. For example, as methods for
collecting the above-mentioned polymer, there have been
known a method which comprises only adding a poor solvent 
to a polymer solution (Japanese Patent Publication No.
14474/1967), a method which comprises pulverizing the
polymer by a kneader (Japanese Patent Publication No.
15899/1978) and a method which comprises pouring the polymer
into warm water, and then pulverizing it (Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No. 74231/1989). However,
these methods all require specific facilities, which increases
the cost of the facilities and the polymer collection
inconveniently.On the other hand, when the polymer is collected
from the organic solvent solution of the polymer, particularly
the polycarbonate, a large amount of the solvent
usually remains in the solid polymer, and this fact deteriorates
the quality and physical properties of a polymer
product such as the polycarbonate. In order to solve this
problem, various techniques have been disclosed. For
example, there has been a method which comprises feeding a
polymer solution to the polycarbonate granules to vaporize
a solvent (Japanese Patent Application laid-open Nos.
189835/1992 and 226541/1992), but in this method, a dense
polycarbonate powder is formed, so that drying characteristics
are very poor. If the powder is heated up to about
250°C so as to improve the drying characteristics, the
polymer particles are inconveniently liable to fuse and
deteriorate, and the particle diameter of
