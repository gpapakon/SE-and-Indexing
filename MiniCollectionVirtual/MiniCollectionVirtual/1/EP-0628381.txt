<ABSTRACT>
Head for a polishing machine, comprising a vertical drive shaft (1) connected on one side to a corresponding movement member (1') and on the other side to a casing (3) by means of a flange (2), several sector holders (19) each of which is oscillating about a corresponding longitudinal axis (90) parallel to the working plane, a cam (6) with an annular groove (7) for the movement of the said sector holders (19), this cam being actuated by means of a set of gears (4, 5, 14) activated by the said drive shaft (1), in which head: the shaft (9) of at least one sector holder (19) is provided with a first vertical stud (15) integral with a roller (8) which is guided in the groove (7) of the cam (6) and with a second stud (16) transverse to the shaft (9) and extending beyond it; a first ring (10) mounted on the shaft (9) of each sector holder (19) and fixed to the casing (3) and provided with a seat (11) for an idling pivot (12) orthogonal to the shaft (9): the said pivot (12) being fastenable to the ring (10) in a way such that it ends up running in a corresponding longitudinal through-track in the shaft (9); a second ring (18) which is coaxial with and having a smaller diameter than the first (10) secured to the corresponding sector holder (19) and provided with two button hole slots (17) with helical tracks for guiding the ends of the abovementioned second stud (16) of the respective shaft (9).
