<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to lead-acid
batteries and more especially to sealed lead-acid batteries
(SLAB), recombinant and valve regulated lead-acid batteries
(VRLAB). More particularly, this invention relates to a
system for maintaining intimate plate-to-separator contact
during a battery's lifetime.Lead-acid battery cells comprise one or more positive
plates alternating with one or more negative plates with a
separator in between adjacent pairs of plates. The active
ingredient on the positive plates is lead dioxide; the
active ingredient on the negative plates is spongy lead.
A number of materials have been employed as separators. At
the present time, separators are typically made of a
compressible pad or sponge of an absorptive glass fiber
material. This absorptive glass mat (AGM) not only
provides electrical separation between the positive and
negative plates, it also absorbs and contains the acid
electrolyte (H2SO4 + H2O) that the cells require for
operation.In order to get each of the adjacent positive and
negative plates close together, the plates and separators
are assembled with the plates standing and compressed
between the walls of the battery. This arrangement
compresses the separators. AGMs absorb more electrolyte 
when compressed. Each AGM has a specific compressive range
in which it will absorb a maximum amount of electrolyte.
Generally, the AGMs are compressed before the electrolyte
is added. With the exception of flooded recombinant
batteries, all of the electrolyte in a SLAB provided with
AGMs is normally contained in the AGMs, and in the plate
pores.Compressing an AGM separator the optimum amount not
only allows the absorption of more electrolyte, it also
provides good contact between each separator and its
adjacent plates. It is extremely important that each
separator completely contact the entire surface area of
each adjacent plate. This plate-to-separator contact
provides an ionic conduction path between the plates and
through the separator.It has been found that any loss of contact between
plate surfaces and separators results in an immediate
degradation of cell performance and life. After such a
loss of contact, the battery will have a lower discharge
capacity, a loss in the number of amps out per square inch
of battery plate surface area and increased internal
resistance. Such a loss of contact all too often occurs
while recharging a lead-acid battery, especially a sealed
VRLAB. Lead-acid batteries produce gas during recharge.
This is particularly true at a voltage above

A valve regulated, sealed lead-acid storage battery comprising:

a battery case (32);
an assembly of stacked biplates (20), each of said biplates (20) comprising positive (23) and negative (21) plates and including
compressible separators (36) between adjacent biplates (20), wherein

said positive (23) and negative (21) plates core connected
by lead-coated glass cores (26); and
a locking assembly adapted to hold the biplates (20) together
with the separators (36) compressed and with the

biplates (20) sufficiently isolated from the battery case (32) to resist
disassembly of the biplates (20) upon expansion of the

battery case (32), wherein the locking assembly comprises a separate
end plate (10, 12) at each end of the assembly of stacked biplates (20) tied

together by a plurality of tensile members (16) with a peripheric
arrangement of

the tensile members (16)
spaced around the lower end plate (12).

comprise fiberglass mats.
The storage battery of claim 1 or 2, wherein one of the
end plates (12) comprises one end of the case. 
The storage battery of one of the preceding claims, wherein the locking
assembly further comprises at least one elastically compressible member

(50, 54, 56) adapted to drive one of the plates (10, 12) toward the
other plate (10, 12).
The storage battery of claim 4, where the compressible member comprises
a compression spring (50).
The storage battery of one of the preceding claims, wherein one of the
end plates comprises a compressible leaf spring (54).

A method of fabricating a valve regulated, sealed lead-acid storage
battery comprising:


assembling a plurality of stacks of biplates (20), each of said biplates (20) comprising positive (23) and negative (21)
plates with a permeable separator material (36) separating each

pair of adjacent biplates (20);
connecting
said positive (23) and

negative (21) plates by lead-coated glass cores (26);
positioning the biplates (20) on a first rigid support;
positioning a second rigid support (10) on the biplates

compressing the biplates (20) between the rigid supports
(10, 20);
securing the rigid supports (10, 12) to lock the
biplates (20) in compression by a plurality of tensile members (16);
