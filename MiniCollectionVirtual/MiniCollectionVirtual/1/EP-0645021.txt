Long-range, infrared, panoramic surveillance 
device with wide angular coverage (), particularly in 

elevation along an elevation axis (SS'), including a head 
objective (1) for forming an image of the scene observed 

on a linear detector array (2) associated with a circuit 
(3) for reading the charges liberated by the linear 

array, this assembly of elements being placed on a 
turntable (8) driven in uniform rotation about an azimuth 

axis (GG'), this surveillance device being characterized 
in that the said assembly further includes at least one 

second linear detector array (21, 22; 23-26; 21'-24'), 
each linear detector array of the said assembly being 

coupled electronically to a respective read circuit 
delivering a video signal via an electronic preprocessing 

circuit (7), and optically to the head objective (1) via 
an image splitter (15; 15'), placed in the vicinity of 

the focal plane of the head objective, and a repeater 
objective (161, 162; 163-166; 161'-164'), each linear 

array being placed, with the corresponding read circuit, 
in a cryostat (4; 41, 42), the head objective (1), seen 

from each linear array of the said assembly, forming an 
intermediate image (II1, II2; II'1-II'4) projected onto 

the corresponding linear array by the optical coupling 
performed by the image splitter and the corresponding 

repeater objective, the linear arrays of the assembly 
being offset (ΔS,ΔS') along the elevation axis (S'S) in 

order to form partial images of the field scanned along 
the elevation axis, the electronic preprocessing circuit 

making it possible to reconstitute an image of the scene  
 

from the partial images. 
Surveillance device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the image splitter (15) includes two flat 

mirrors (151, 152) having a common edge (A), the two 
mirrors being oriented so as to form, on each linear 

array (21, 22), by reflection on each of them then 
coupling through the corresponding repeater objective 

(161, 162), a partial image offset along the elevation 
axis (S'S) of the image of the scene observed. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the intermediate image (II1, II2) seen from each 

linear array (21, 22) is situated in proximity to each 
mirror (151, 152). 
Device according to Claims 2 and 3, characterized 
in that the mirrors (151, 152) are spaced apart and in 

that a linear array is arranged on the optical axis (XX') 
of the head objective (1) downstream of the splitter 

(15). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the image splitter (15') includes four flat mirrors 

(151'; 152'; 153'; 154') in the shape of a roof having a 
main edge (A') parallel to the elevation axis (SS') and 

common to two of the mirrors (151'; 152'), in that each 
mirror is associated with a linear detector array (21'; 

22'; 23'; 24') through a repeater device (161'; 162' 
163'; 164'), the two linear arrays (21'; 22') associated 

with the mirrors with the common edge (A') being parallel 
to the elevation axis (SS') and the other two linear 

arrays (23'; 24') being perpendicular to the elevation 
axis (SS') in the plane containing the elevation axis 

(SS') and the optical axis (X'X) of the head objective 
(1). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the offset between the linear 

arrays along the elevation axis is adjusted to cause a 
partial overlap of the fields scanned by these linear 

arrays. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a spherical mirror (171, 172) is  

 
arranged on each secondary optical axis of the repeater 

objectives (161, 162), each spherical mirror having a 
centre of curvature situated in proximity to the centre 

of the corresponding linear array (21, 22) and being 
pierced at their centre by an aperture allowing only the 

useful rays to pass. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the head objective (1) includes 

three lenses (110, 120, 130) and each repeater objective 
(161, 162) four lenses, the exit pupil of the head objective 

being transposed to infinity and the exit pupils of 
the repeater objectives being situated in the cryostat. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the offset between the linear 

arrays (21, 22; 21', 22') is expressed by a partial 
overlap (Δs) along the elevation axis (SS') of the fields 

scanned by the linear arrays when the device rotates. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the centres (I1, I2, I'1, I'2, I'3, 

I'4) of the intermediate images (II1, II2, II'1, II'2, 
II'3, II'4) are situated on the optical axes (X'1, X1, 

X'2, X2) of the repeater objectives (161, 162).
