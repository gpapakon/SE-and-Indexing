<ABSTRACT>
The metering method consists essentially in compressing the paste in the metering chamber (4) and then, next, in expelling the paste towards the end-piece (10) after opening of the means (8), the volume-metering of the quantity to be dispensed being carried out by measuring the displacement of the piston (3) during expulsion. The method makes provision for the application of a reduced pressure (vacuum) in the metering chamber in order to facilitate the introduction of the paste and the expulsion of the paste at a high speed and then at a low speed. The invention also relates to a machine for applying the metering method. APPLICATION: cramming of palmipeds (web-footed birds).
