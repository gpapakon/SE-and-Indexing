<ABSTRACT>
A needle (16) which can be moved in order to sample the liquid in the bottle, is mounted on a slide (5) which can be moved vertically with respect to a support plate (1) incorporated in the sampling apparatus. The sampling needle penetrates a percussion head (10) mounted on the base of the plate, to which head a piercing needle is connected. A rinsing duct (12) connects the percussion head with the outside. Application to the sampling of blood in a haematological analysis apparatus.

Device for cleaning a needle (16) for sampling a liquid
from a bottle closed by a bung, wherein the said sampling needle is

mounted on a mobile mechanism (5) that moves downwards to ensure
the sampling of liquid from the bottle and wherein the sampling

needle passes through a needle (13) for piercing the bung,
characterized in that the sampling needle passes through a guide

member (10, 20) and the guide member (10, 20) is mounted on the
lower portion of a support bracket (1) integrated in the sampling

apparatus, and in that the said guide member also serves to support
the piercing needle (13) and is provided with at least one conduit

(12, 26, 29) communicating with the piercing needle for venting the
bottle to ambient air and rinsing the sampling needle (16).
Cleaning device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the member for guiding the sampling needle (16) is a

percussion head (10) fixed to the base of the bracket (1) serving
as a support for the device, pierced by a vertical shaft (11) which

passes through it completely and inside which is fixed the piercing
needle (13).
Cleaning device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the member for guiding the sampling needle (16) is a dilution

vessel (20) fixed to the base of bracket (1) serving as a support
for the device, in that the piercing needle (13) is held inside a

plug (21) mounted under the vessel, the bottom of the latter
communicating with the piercing needle via a vertical guide hole

(22).
Cleaning device according to claim 3, characterized in
that lateral orifices (27, 28) place the internal chamber (23) of

the dilution vessel (20) in communication with the outside.
Cleaning device according to claim 4, characterized in
that a metering member is positioned on the lateral orifices (27,

28).
Cleaning device according to claim 2, characterized in
that at least one seal (25) is mounted on the top of the percussion

head (10) to ensure tightness between the sampling needle (16) and
the piercing needle (13). 
Cleaning device according to claim 3, characterized in
that seals (25) are provided between the dilution vessel (20) and

the plug (21), at the top of the piercing needle (13).
Cleaning device according to claims 1 and 4, characterized
in that the bottom of the inner chamber (23) of the dilution vessel

(20) has a conical profile.
Cleaning device according to claims 1 and 7, characterized
in that the bottom of the inner chamber (23) of the dilution vessel

(20) is hollowed to form a flat alveole (30) through the centre of
which passes the sampling needle (16).
Cleaning device according to claim 3, characterized in
that the dilution vessel is provided with at least one

spectrophotometric measuring system.
