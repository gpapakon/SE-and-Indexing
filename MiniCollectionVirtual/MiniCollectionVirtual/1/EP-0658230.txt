<ABSTRACT>
A post (2) for use in a post and rail crash barrier (1) comprising a lower end (3) to be secured to a base (4), a front face (6) to which one or more rails (8) may be secured and two side faces, the rear face and/or at least one of the side faces (9, 10) being formed at a position intermediate its length with a horizontally extending first notch (16) having upper and lower surfaces (18, 19). When the lower end is restrained, an impact load transmitted to the front face (6) causes the post (2) to distort in a region including the notch (16) so that the surfaces (18, 19) close towards one another prior to any fracture at or adjacent the front face of the post or at or adjacent its restrained lower end (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fences and more particularly to 
crash barriers for location alongside a vehicle carrying 
bridge or road. Many proposals have been made and crash barriers are in 
extensive use in many countries. GB patent 1209191 shows a 
construction in aluminium alloy which has been widely used. 
In the arrangement of GB 1209191 a series of upright posts are 
joined by several horizontal rails. The posts are designed to 
be frangible and to fail upon vehicle impact in order to 
absorb as much of the impact energy as possible. The failure 
zone in this case is at or near a welded joint between the 
post and a base plate and it has not proved possible to 
predict accurately the impact load that will cause failure. 
This is because there can be significant differences in the 
strength characteristics of the welds from post to post and 
also adjacent to the welds there is a heat affected zone which 
again may vary the strength characteristics of one post 
compared with another. Thus it has been found that the posts of GB 1209191 tend to 
tear away their base weld upon rotation, upon impact, through 
about 2Â° but that the impact load to achieve this varies from 
post to post by up to 30%. Applicants are aware of one previous proposal to provide more 
accurate and reproducible post distortion. This is in a 
Japanese product (GB 2032496 A) where the rear wall of each 
post is formed with a shallow inward curve extending from the 
base of the post to a position nearly halfway of its height. 
This arrangement undoubtedly ensures that upon impact the post  
 
will crumple firstly at the curve. However the vertical 
extent of the curve and the uncertainty of its large radius of 
curvature ensures that there will still be variations in 
distortion of different posts subjected to the same impact 
load. In the arrangement of GB 1209191 the rails are formed with a 
rearwardly facing re-entrant slot to receive the heads of four 
bolts secured through holes in the flat front faces of the 
posts. With this arrangement, the restraint to "windmilling" 
is dependent only upon the four bolts. Additionally GB 1209191 provides for sheets of wire mesh to be 
provided as infill between the rails. However different rail 
sections having extruded slots are used to receive differently 
sized sheets of mesh. During accident damage repair it is 
necessary to partly dismantle the rail structure to slide out 
the mesh and replace it. Thus it is the object of the present invention to provide an 
improved crash barrier of

A post (2) for use in a post and rail crash barrier (1)

front face (6) to which one or more rails (8) may be secured 
a rear face (7) and two side faces (9 and 10), characterised 

in that the rear face or the rear face and at least one of the 
side faces is formed at a position intermediate its length 

with a horizontally extending first notch or cut-out (13, 16, 
17) having upper and lower surfaces (18, 19) so that, when the 

lower end is restrained, an impact load transmitted to the 
front face causes the post to distort in a region including 

the notch so that the surfaces close towards one another prior 
to any fracture at or adjacent the front face of the post or 

at or adjacent its restrained lower end. 
A post according to claim 1 in which the distortion 
continues until the surfaces close together. 
A post according to claim 1 in which the distortion 
continues until the surfaces close on to an intermediate 

member (41). 
A post according to claim 2 or claim 3 in which the 
impact load required to distort the post after the surfaces 

have closed together or against an intermediate member is not 
less than that required to commence closure of the surfaces. 
A post according to claim 2 or claim 3 in which one or 
more additional notches are provided above the first notch, 

all the notches being of such size and shape that upon 
application of the impact load their upper and lower faces 

close together in vertical succession.  
 
A post according to any one of the preceding claims which 
is a hollow extrusion from an aluminium alloy and is generally 

rectangular in cross-section, with two sidewalls and front and 
rear faces and having a web (11) extending across the post 

between the side walls at a position spaced from the front and 
rear faces.

which the upper end of the rear face is tapered upwardly 

towards the front face.

means are provided to encourage the post to distort evenly 

across its width after being subject to an impact load.

of the post in the region of the notch.

face in spaced relationship to the other surface of the notch
