<ABSTRACT>
A physically intermixed catalyst system comprising two distinctly different catalytic particles, the first of which is a hydrodenitrification and/or hydrodesulfurization catalyst and the second of which is a relatively active hydrocracking catalyst, wherein the catalyst particles of both catalytic components are substantially the same size, that is the effective diameter of each catalyst component is substantially the same. The catalyst system of the present invention can be layered with unmixed catalysts. The novel systems of the present invention have been found to provide surprisingly good selectivity for liquid products and stability against catalyst fouling when used in combined hydrotreating and hydrocracking applications, and can therefore be used to provide a stable catalyst system which offers even heat distribution and reactor control in such applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst system and a
process for combined hydrotreating and hydrocracking
operations in a single reactor bed by contacting a
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock with hydrogen under
hydrocracking conditions in the presence of an appropriate
dual function catalyst system. In particular, the catalyst
system and process of this invention relate to a combined
denitrification and/or desulfurization hydrotreating process
and a hydrocracking process wherein the catalyst system
exhibits surprising stability and high selectivity for
liquid products boiling in the transportation fuels range.
The catalyst system can be tailored to provide previously
unavailable flexibility with regard to the selection of the
hydrocracking catalyst.The dual function catalyst system
comprises two randomly intermixed particulate catalysts
having distinctly different catalytic functions. The first
catalyst is a conventional hydrodenitrification and/or
hydrodesulfurization catalyst having substantially no 
cracking activity. The second catalyst is a conventional
zeolitic hydrocracking catalyst. Both catalysts are
selected so that they are substantially the same size, that
is, the effective diameter for each catalyst particle is
substantially the same.The novel catalyst systems have
been found to provide surprisingly good selectivity for
liquid products and stability against catalyst fouling when
used in combined hydrotreating and hydrocracking
applications, and can therefore be used to provide a stable
catalyst system which offers even heat distribution and
reactor control in such applications.Of the many hydroconversion processes known to the petroleum
refining industry, catalytic hydrotreating and catalytic
hydrocracking are perhaps the two most widely applied and
important. In conventional refining practice, hydrotreating
is carried out using a catalyst(s) having as the principle
function the removal of nitrogen and/or sulfur, that is
catalytic hydrodenitrification and hydrodesulfurization.
The product of hydrotreating is then fed to a hydrocracking
process unit which uses catalysts having as the principle
function hydroconversion to produce liquid products boiling
in the transportation fuels range.Hydrotreating the feedstock to a hydrocracking process unit
is particularly important as nitrogen and sulfur are known
to contaminate conventional hydrocracking process catalysts.
Thus, hydrotreating is used to lower the nitrogen and sulfur
content of the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock stream to an
acceptable level
