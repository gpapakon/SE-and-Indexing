<ABSTRACT>
A whipstock assembly (10) comprises a setting section (16) and a guide section (18) which are substantially rigidly connected together. In preferred embodiments, a fulcrum member (40) is provided which projects outwardly from the housing (20). When the whipstock assembly (10) is landed a coil spring (28) biases a wedge (34) upwardly and outwardly into contact with the casing (12). This pivots the setting section (16) and the guide section (18) about the fulcrum member (40) and biases the guide section (18) against the casing (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to whipstock assemblies. Whipstock assemblies are used in deviated drilling. 
In particular, conventional wellbores extend generally 
vertically into the ground. Once a particular strata is 
reached it is sometimes desirable to drill horizontally 
into that strata. In order to achieve this a landing 
plug is lowered down the casing of the well and locked 
in position. A whipstock assembly comprising a setting 
section and a guide section is then lowered down the 
casing and, when it reaches the landing plug a mechanism 
is actuated which locks the setting section in place. 
The guide section essentially comprises an upwardly 
tapered concave wedge. When the whipstock assembly is in 
place a milling tool is lowered along the guide section 
and actuated to cut a hole in the casing. The milling 
tool is then replaced by a normal drill which, guided by 
the guide section, drills a bore at an angle to the 
initial wellbore. In certain conventional whipstock assemblies the 
guide section is pivotally mounted to the setting section 
and reliance is placed on spring assemblies acting 
between the setting section and the guide section to 
maintain the guide section against the wall of the 
casing. In other known whipstock assemblies, such as shown 
in GB-A-727 897 (which forms the basis of the precharacterising 
portion of Claim 1), the guide section 
and the setting section are integrally formed and reliance 
is placed on a spring assembly acting between the 
setting section and a setting shoe to maintain the guide 
section against the wall of the casing. It will be appreciated that if the top of the guide 
section is not restrained firmly against the casing 
there is a possibility that the milling tool and/or the  
 
drill string will land on the top of the guide section 
or possibly even be guided to the wrong side of the 
casing. This problem is particularly acute when the initial 
wellbore is not truly vertical but is itself curved and 
it is desired to drill a lateral wellbore from the lower 
side of the casing. In this case the springs acting 
between the setting section and the guide section not 
only have to hold the top of the guide section against 
the casing but also act against the turning movement of 
the entire guide section tending to urge the top of the 
guide section towards the lower side of the casing. 
Since guide sections are generally relatively long 
(typically 4 to 7 metres) it will be appreciated that 
the problem becomes progressively more serious as the 
main
