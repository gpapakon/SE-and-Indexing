<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a spark plug device wherein an ignition cable (11) and 
a spark plug body (13) connected to each other through a terminal fixture (12) 

are covered with a tubular plug cap (14), on which a rubber cap (15) and a rain 
cap (16) are mounted at its respective ends, and an insulating cover (17) is 

fitted in the inner peripheral surface of the plug cap (14) in a portion 
corresponding to the terminal fixture (12) to fill a gap external to the terminal 

fixture (12), whereby the spark plug device prevents corona discharge adjacent 
the terminal fixture and has excellent durability and reliable insulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spark plug device 
for a DOHC (double overhead camshaft) type gasoline engine 
or the like which has an ignition cable connected to a 
spark plug body and, more particularly, to a spark plug device 
capable of effectivelv preventing degradation of a 
plug cap by corona discharge. An example of spark plug devices for DOHC type gasoline 
engines is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The spark plug device of Fig. 2 comprises a terminal 
fixture 53 shown in Fig. 3 which has a crimp-fixing portion 
53a crimped and fixed to an end of an ignition cable 51 for 
electrical connection between the terminal fixture 53 and 
the ignition cable 51, and a front end portion 53b fitted 
to a terminal portion of a spark plug body 52 for electrical 
connection between the spark plug body 52 and the ignition 
cable 51. The connected portion from the ignition cable 51 to the 
spark plug body 52 is covered with a relatively long tubular 
plug cap 54 made of synthetic resin. A rain cover 55 to 
be fitted to a plug hole of an engine is mounted on the 
plug cap 54 at its one end on the ignition cable side, and 
a rubber cap 56 is mounted on the plug cap 54 at its other 
end on the spark plug body side. The above-mentioned spark plug device has a gap between 
the outer peripheral surface of the terminal fixture 53 and 
the inner peripheral surface of the plug cap 54. When the 
spark plug has a high discharge voltage (for example, 
more than 30 kV), a potential gradient at a surface of 
the plug cap 54 of synthetic resin is not less than 3 
kV/mm, which is prone to corona discharge in the air adjacent 
the terminal fixture 53, resulting in the likelihood 
of not only lowering of insulation of the plug cap 54 with  
 
degradation thereof by corona discharge but also pin holes 
due to dielectric breakdown. US-A-2 458 121 shows a spark plug device for connecting 
an ignition cable to a spark plug body having a terminal, 
wherein a plug cap for covering a spark plug body together 
with the ignition cable is provided and wherein an insulating 
filler material is provided between the outer peripheral 
surface of terminal fixture means and the inner peripheral 
surface of the plug cap. The filler material is 
for preventing ingress of moisture and air to the contacting 
portion between the ignition cable and the terminal of 
the spark plug body. US-A-2 458 121 teaches that an insulating 
filler material should be used. Such an insulation 
filler is e.g. a suitable liquid resin, which is filled 
into the place in
