<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a drive, in particular a drive for a transfer press which is designed to transport workpieces through the work stations (2) in three axes by means of feedbars (9,10). In order to permit conversion of the feedbar position to the conditions imposed by different workpieces as the set-up axis, the drive housings (23,23') are designed to be transversely displaceable by means of a displacement drive (41).

A transfer drive for a press, with a device for the triaxial transport of workpieces 
through machining stations of the press, with, disposed parallel with each other, two 

carrier or gripper rails (9, 10) which, by means of a forward feed mechanism (11, 12), 
perform a horizontal longitudinal movement and, by means of a lifting mechanism (13), 

a vertical movement and also, by means of a clamping or closing mechanism (14), a 
transverse movement, whereby the starting position of the gripper rail drive for the 

forward feed mechanism (11, 12) is, as a workpiece dependent mounting axis (33, 33') 
variable in the transverse direction of the press arrangement, whereby the forward feed 

mechanism (11, 12) comprises a drive lever (32, 32') pivotable in the longitudinal direction 
of the press and a push rod (52, 52') connected to the respective gripper rail (9, 10), 

characterised in that the drive lever (32, 32') is connected directly via the push rod (52, 
52') to the respective gripper rail (9, 10) and in that in order to vary the spacing of the 

forward feed mechanism (11, 12), a displacement drive (41, 41) is provided which 

displaces the forward feed mechanism (11, 12) with the associated drive lever (32, 32') 
as a whole crosswise to the direction of transport. 
A drive according to claim 1, characterised in that the forward feed mechanism 
(11, 12) is disposed in a drive housing (23, 23') with a gear arrangement and in that the 

displacement drive (41, 41') which produces a transverse displacement of the drive 
housing (23, 23') including the forward feed mechanism (11, 12). 
A drive according to claim 2, characterised in that the lateral spacing of the drive 
housing (23, 23') for the forward feed mechanism (11, 12) is in each case achieved via at 

least one driveable screw threaded rod (47, 47' or 48, 48' or 60, 60') co-operating with an 
associated spindle nut (50) on the drive housing (23, 23').  

 
A drive according to claim 3, characterised in that a central displacement drive 
(41, 41') for adjusting the spacing of the drive housing (23, 23') including the forward feed 

mechanism (11, 12) is provided whereby via a first deflecting gear mechanism (23), it is 
possible to drive two aligned drive shafts (45, 45') which at their ends respectively drive 

a second deflecting gear mechanism (46) for driving the screw threaded spindles (47, 47' 
and 48, 48'). 
A drive according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that two pairs of screw 
threaded spindles (47, 47' and 48, 48') disposed parallel with each other are associated 

with each drive housing (23, 23'). 
A drive according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the drive 
for the forward feed mechanism (11, 12) and/or the lifting mechanism (13) and/or the 

clamping or closing mechanism (14) is effected via the central drive (18, 19) of the gang 
press. 
A drive according to one of the preceding claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
drive for the forward feed mechanism (11, 12) and/or the lifting mechanism (13) and/or 

the clamping or closing mechanism (14) is effected via in each case a separate drive. 
A drive according to claim 7, characterised in that the drive for the forward feed 
mechanism (11, 12) is effected via means of a separate drive |(54, 55) independently of 

the other drive system of the gripper rails (9, 10) whereby a central displacement drive 
(41') is provided to perform a transverse movement of the associated drive housing (23, 

23'). 
A drive according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the displacement drive (41') 
comprises a drive motor (42') which, via a deflecting gear transmission (43') acts on two 

drive shafts (60, 60') constructed as screw threaded spindles and which engage spindle 
nuts (50) on the drive housing (23, 23') to produce their lateral displacement.  

 
A drive according to one of claims 7 to 9, characterised in that the individual 
movements are synchronised with one another and with the movement of the press.
