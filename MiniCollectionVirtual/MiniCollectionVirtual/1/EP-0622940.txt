<ABSTRACT>
In this method, it is provided that the transmission devices (TAE1, TAE2) are alternately switched on commissioning, in each case independently, to one of the two complementary operating modes for a predefined time interval and a start-up procedure corresponding to the respective operating mode is initiated by the respective transmission device by the emission of at least one defined signal. The duration of the predefined time interval is varied by a random value with each changeover of the operating mode. A changeover of the operating mode for the respective transmission device takes place until the transmission devices are switched to the two complementary operating modes and a signal exchange corresponding to these modes takes place.
