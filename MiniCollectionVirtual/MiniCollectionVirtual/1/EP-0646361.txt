<ABSTRACT>
There is described an electrosurgical high-frequency instrument for coagulating and/or cutting tissue with a shaft (1) having a high-frequency voltage connection (10). On the distal end of the shaft there is arranged a working tip (2, 2') with two electrodes (5, 5', 6, 6') which are or can be connected to the high-frequency voltage connection. The working tip is hook-shaped or spatula-shaped and comprises the two electrodes arranged next to one another and an insulating layer (7, 7') arranged in between and connected to the electrodes to form a structural unit.

Electro-surgical high frequency instrument for the coagulation 
and/or cutting of tissue comprising a shaft 

(1) which is provided with a high frequency voltage connection 
(10) and which has at its distal end a working 

tip (2) consisting of a flat elongate insulating layer 
(7) with two similar parallel flat surfaces at a relatively 

small spacing, which extend away from the shaft, 
and of two electrodes (5; 6) of which each has a flat 

surface which lies parallel to the one or other surface 
of the insulating layer respectively, which have the 

same size as the one or other surface of the insulating 
layer respectively and which are so attached to it that 

the transition from the surfaces of the electrodes to 
those of the insulating layer extends continuously, 

characterised in that the unit consisting of the insulating 
layer (7) and of the two electrodes (5, 6) is 

formed as a hook (4) with axes of curvature extending 
perpendicular to the parallel flat surfaces of the insulating 

layer. 
Electro-surgical high frequency instrument in accordance 
with claim 1, characterised in that the curvature of the 

hook (4) amounts to more than 90Â°. 
Electro-surgical high frequency instrument for the coagulation 
and/or cutting of tissue comprising a shaft 

(1) which is provided with a high frequency voltage connection 
(10) and which has at its distal end a working 

tip (2') consisting of a flat elongate insulating layer 
(7') with two similar parallel flat surfaces at a relatively 

small spacing, which extend away from the shaft,  
 

and of two electrodes (5'; 6') of which each has a flat 
surface which lies parallel to the one or other surface 

of the insulating layer respectively, which have the 
same size as the one or other surface of the insulating 

layer respectively and which are so attached to it that 
the transition from the surfaces of the electrodes to 

those of the insulating layer extends continuously, 
characterised in that the insulating layer (7') is 

formed as a bar of rectangular cross-section and the 
electrodes (5', 6') have a symmetrical thickened portion 

(13, 14) with a rounded off lateral bulge close to the 
distal end in such a way that the unit consisting of the 

insulating layer (7') and the two electrodes (5', 6') 
has the shape of a spatula. 
Electro-surgical high frequency instrument in accordance 
with claim 3, characterised in that the electrodes (5', 

6') extend on both sides of the insulating layer away 
from the latter at least at some points by a distance 

which is greater than the width of the insulating layer 
(7'). 
Electro-surgical high frequency instrument in accordance 
with one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 

at least one of the electrodes (5, 6) is of tapered 
shape in the region of the free end (8) of the working 

tip and/or is partly covered over by an insulating 
means. 
Electro-surgical high frequency instrument in accordance 
with one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 

the working tip (2, 2'), or a base body (16) which carries 
them, is releasably secured to the shaft (1).  

 
Electro-surgical high frequency instrument in accordance 
with claim 6, characterised in that the working tip (2, 

2'), or a base body (16) which carries them is secured 
by one or more latch elements (15) to the shaft (1). 
Electro-surgical high frequency instrument in accordance 
with claim 6 or claim 7, in which the high frequency 

voltage connection (10) is located at the distal end of 
the shaft (1), characterised in that high frequency 

voltage plug or slip contacts (19, 20, 21, 22) are provided 
at the partition point between the working tip (2) 

or the basic body (16) which carries them and the shaft 
(1). 
Electro-surgical high frequency instrument in accordance 
with claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the outer 

surfaces of the electrodes (5, 6) extend partly at least 
substantially parallel to the preferably flat insulation 

layer (7).
