<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of an aluminium 

phthalocyanine composition or a halogenated aluminium 
phthalocyanine composition at high yields with high economic 

performance, which process comprises bringing a molten salt of 
aluminium chloride and/or aluminium bromide and a 

phthalocyanine compound having a central substance other than 
aluminium into contact at a predetermined temperature range 

thereby to substitute aluminium for the central substance, and 
optionally introducing a halogen into the resultant reaction 

mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of an aluminum phthalocyanine composition or a
halogenated aluminum phthalocyanine composition.Aluminum phthalocyanine or halogenated aluminum
phthalocyanine is expected to be useful as a pigment
or as a photoconductive material.Halogenated aluminum phthalocyanine
can be synthesized by any one of the following two methods - one
method in which non-halogenated aluminum phthalocyanine is
synthesized first and then halogenated to a necessary
degree, and the other method in which halogenated aluminum
phthalocyanine is synthesized directly from a raw material
halogenated in advance. The former method in which
halogenated aluminum phthalocyanine is synthesized through
two steps has a defect in that the yield of non-halogenated
aluminum phthalocyanine in the first step is low, as low as
50 % or less, as reported by John P. Linsky, Thomas R. Paul,
Ronald S. Hohr and Malcolm E. Kenney report in Inorganic
Chem. 19, 3131-3135 (1980). The latter method in which
halogenated aluminum phthalocyanine is synthesized directly
from a halogenated raw material is disclosed in U. S. Patent
2,549,842 and Zn. Obshch. Khim. 40 (2) 400 (1979), while it
is not practically useful since the raw material is
expensive. As explained above, there has been no
practically useful method for producing halogenated aluminum
phthalocyanine.Meanwhile, JP-A-52-155625 discloses that a trace 
amount of aluminum hexadecachlorophthalocyanine is formed as
a byproduct during a reaction for producing copper
hexadecachlorophthalocyanine as an end product by adding
copper phthalocyanine into a molten salt of aluminum
chloride and then introducing chlorine. In the method
disclosed in the above publication, for preventing the
formation of an aluminum-substituted byproduct, the
temperature at which copper phthalocyanine is added is
decreased, and the copper phthalocyanine is added for a
short period of time with introducing chlorine. However,
when the above reaction is carried out at 190°C, the highest
temperature for chlorination, there is obtained no
composition having an aluminum phthalocyanine content of at
least 50 % by weight.The present inventors have found that there is a
particular temperature, which should be called a threshold
temperature, at which aluminum phthalocyanine or halogenated
aluminum phthalocyanine is efficiently formed by the
substitution of a central atom in a molten salt
containing aluminum chloride and/or aluminum bromide, and
have also found that the substitution
