<ABSTRACT>
A method of illuminating flags raised on flagpoles, particularly advertising flags of the kind placed along roads and highways adjacent restaurants, hotels and gasoline stations. The invention is characterized in that one or more flags (1) containing ultralight fluorescent material is/are illuminated by one or more lamps (4) which transmit a significant proportion of ultraviolet light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for illuminating flags. Flags are used to a large extent in order to mark the presence of hotels, 
gasoline stations, restaurants, etc. It is often desired to amplify the 
effect produced, by mounting several flags adjacent to one another, often 
hoisted on relatively high flagpoles. The intention is to make the car 
driver aware of the presence of a gasoline station or pull-in in good time 
before the car driver reaches the facility concerned. These flags can be 
seen relatively easily in daylight. However, it is relatively common to illuminate 
flags with lamps during the darker hours. The effect of this illumination, however, is limited, because the lamps 
have a relatively wide angle of spread and because the flag takes-up a 
relatively small area of the light cone of the light beam. Thus, the problem is that the flags are not made visible to a sufficient 
extent, and are therefore not noticed to a sufficient degree during the 
dark hours of the day. This problem is solved by the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of illuminating 
flags that are raised on flagpoles, particularly flags which have an 
advertising character and which are placed along roads and highways to 
advertise restaurants, hotels and gasoline stations. The method is characterized 
in that one or more flags containing ultralight fluorescent 
material is/are illuminated by one or more lamps which transmit a considerable 
proportion of ultraviolet light. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an 
exemplifying embodiment thereof and also with reference to the accompanying  
 
drawing, the single Figure of which illustrates an illuminated flag. The drawing illustrative of the present invention illustrates a flag 1 
which is raised on a flagpole 2 standing on the ground 3. The flags referred 
to are particularly of the kind which carry an advertisement and which are 
placed along roads in the neighbourhood of restaurants, hotels and gasoline 
stations. By advertisement is meant an emblem, a trademark, a so-called 
logo type, a name or the like which distinguishes or characterizes the 
facility at which the flag is raised, for instance a gasoline station or a 
restaurant available to the traveller. However, the invention is not limited to flags which are erected along 
roads in the meaning of country roads, but can be applied to any flag 
which it is desired to illuminate during the dark hours. According to the present method,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for illuminating flags raised on flagpoles, and particularly 
advertising flags which are placed along roads and highways in the neighbourhood 

of restaurants, hotels and gasoline stations, 
characterized
 by providing one or more flags (1) containing 
ultralight fluorescent material and illuminating them with one or more lamps (4) 

transmitting a significant proportion of ultraviolet light, 
said lamps being located spaced apart from the respective flag. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in providing 
the lamps (4) with a filter for filtering-out visible light. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 by 
providing the flags (1) with pigment which fluoresces when irradiated with 

ultraviolet light. 
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized
 by 
producing the flags (1) either completely or partially from a synthetic 

material which fluoresces when irradiated with ultraviolet light. 
A method according to Claim 4, 
characterized
 by producing 
an emblem or a trademark or corresponding symbol on the flags (1) with a 

material which provides a much more powerful fluorescence than the remainder 
of the flags.
