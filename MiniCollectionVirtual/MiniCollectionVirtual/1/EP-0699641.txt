<ABSTRACT>
By performing a debinder process before or at the time of 
firing, and by enhancing a programming rate in the temperature 

range of 650∼950°C, the size of particles shows less 
distribution. Also, when the temperature comprising the particle 

growth range of 1025∼1200°C is maintained for many hours, a zinc 
oxide varistor having relatively large and uniformly formed 

particles can be provided. When a zinc oxide varistor compound 
is fired, a solid solution of zinc oxide spinel is fired at the 

programming rate of 175 to 500°C/hr in the temperature range 
comprising the primary phase of from 650 to 950°C, and at the 

programming rate of 30 to 500°C/hr in the range of from 1250 to 
1300°C. Accordingly, a zinc oxide varistor having comparatively 

large and uniformed formed particles can be obtained. Sintered 
products obtained in this way show less distribution in operating 

voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a
zinc oxide sintered compact body used in a zinc oxide varistor,
which is applied for removing induction noise of lightning, noise
of electric source arising in various electric and electronic
appliances, noise of steep pulse, or surge.Recently, a zinc oxide varistor has been used more and
more in order to assure the safety and operating stability of
electronic and electric appliances against, for example, various
surge or pulse noise or induced lightning, and also to cope with
reinforcement of various noise regulations. A conventional zinc
oxide varistor will now be explained. The operating voltage of a
zinc oxide varistor is the voltage at the time when 1 mA of
electric current runs in the varistor. Depending on the types of
circuits electronic and electric appliances have, the operating
voltage ranges from several tens of V to several tens of thousand
V. However, the operating voltage is basically determined by the
number of particles present between electrodes, and it is known
that the operating voltage per one particle is about 3V. Except
for high voltage products with high operating voltage, low
voltage products have a fixed thickness, so that the operating
voltage is dependent upon the diameter of particles, that is, the
number of particles. When ceramics are sintered, the density starts to
increase in the initial stage without so much accompanying growth
of particles. As soon as the increase stops, growth of
particles, called a secondary recrystallization particle growth,
will then take place. This process often creates abnormally
large particles, which is called an abnormal particle growth,
that causes distribution in operating voltage. Therefore, a
product with operating voltage of 100 V and higher, which may
have small particles, had around 33 particles and more in the 1
mm thickness. Statistically, this product comprised a proper
mixture of large particles and small particles, and distribution
in operating voltage did not become so large as to interfere with
production. In the case of a low voltage product of 100 V and
lower, it was necessary to allow particles to grow. Therefore,
it was common to slow down the programming rate and to fire for
many hours.For the purpose of securing reliability, and also by
estimating drifting during the firing, a zinc oxide varistor is
provided with a large amount of oxide or carbonate to excess, so
that additive elements are sufficiently present inside the
particles and in the particle field. When the
