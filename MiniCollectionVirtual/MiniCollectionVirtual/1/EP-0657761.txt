<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer
dispersion liquid crystal panel forming optical images as
changes in the light scattering condition; to a
manufacturing method for said liquid crystal panel; and to
a projection display device for enlarging and projecting to
a screen the images displayed on this liquid crystal panel.Interest in large-screen display devices has
grown significantly in recent years for applications such
as home theater and business presentations. While many
different types of projection devices using light valves
have been proposed over the years, liquid crystal
projection televisions whereby images displayed on a small
liquid crystal panel are enlarged and projected using a
projection lens and/or other optics to a large screen have
more recently become available.Images are displayed on liquid crystal panels
primarily by electrically changing the optical
characteristics of the liquid crystals. There are many
different methods of accomplishing this based on a variety
of operating principles. Twisted nematic (TN) liquid 
crystal panels used in currently available liquid crystal
projection display devices use the changes in the optical
rotatory power of the liquid crystals effected by varying
the field strength. The drawback to this method is that TN
liquid crystal panels require a polarizing plate on both
the incidence and emission sides for light modulation, and
these polarizing plates lower the efficiency of the device
for light utilization.Methods using the light scattering phenomenon of
the liquid crystals can be used to control light without
using polarizing plates. Examples of liquid crystal panels
whereby optical images are formed by changing the light
scattering state of the liquid crystals include phase
change (PC), dynamic scattering (DSM), and polymer
dispersion liquid crystals. Due to demand for improved
image brightness, polymer dispersion liquid crystal panels
such as described in US-A-4,435,047
are being actively researched.
US-A-4,613,207 describes a liquid crystal projector comprising a
polymer dispersion liquid crystal panel which, sometimes, is also
called an encapsulated liquid crystal panel.Polymer dispersion liquid crystals are described
briefly below. Polymer dispersion liquid crystals can be
divided into two major types according to the dispersion
state of the liquid crystals and polymer. In one type,
drop-shaped liquid crystals are dispersed in a polymer
substance, and the liquid crystals are present in the
polymer substance in a discontinuous state; this
