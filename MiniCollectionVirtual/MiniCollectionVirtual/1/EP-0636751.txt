<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes an apparatus for retaining solids, carried along in water, at overflows of rainwater-discharge systems (11), having a shaft (2) which is arranged in the region of an overflow sill (1) and parallel thereto and can be driven in rotation counter to the flow direction of the overflow water and is provided with arresting elements (3), and further having an intercepting trough (6) which is arranged upstream of, and parallel to, the shaft (2) and is intended for receiving the solids, said intercepting trough (6) being connected hydraulically to the waste-water flow to the clarifying installation. By means of such an apparatus, solids can be retained, in a simple and operationally reliable manner, from the overflow water at the overflow sill (1) and channelled to the clarifying installation. The apparatus may, in addition, be easily retrofitted in existing discharge systems.

A device for retaining solids entrained in water at overflows of rainwater discharge
installations (11), having a shaft (2) which can be driven, which is equipped with

collecting elements (3) and which is disposed in the region of an overflow barrier (1)
and parallel thereto, wherein when the shaft (2) rotates in the opposite direction to the

direction of flow of the overflow water the lower collecting elements (3) are moved
through the overflow water, and having in addition a catchment trough (6) for

receiving the solids, which is disposed in front of and parallel to the shaft (2),
wherein the catchment trough (6) is hydraulically connected to the flow of waste

water to the sewage works.
A device according to claim 1, wherein the shaft (2) is disposed in front of, above
or behind the overflow barrier (1).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the collecting elements are constructed
as bristles (3) with which the shaft (2) is covered.
A device according to claim 3, wherein the bristles (3) disposed on the shaft (2) are
flexible.
A device according to claim 4, wherein the flexible bristles (3) have a ballast body
(4) at their free ends.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the shaft (2) is driven by
motor power or by the energy of flow of the discharging overflow water.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein a downflow baffle (5) is
disposed in front of and parallel to the shaft (2). 
A device according to claim 7, wherein the catchment trough (6) is integrated in the
downflow baffle (5).
A device according to claim 8, wherein the downflow baffle (5) comprises the
catchment trough (6) in its lower region.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the catchment trough (6) can
be flushed by the inflow of waste water or with the aid of a flushing device.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the catchment trough (6)
has a descending gradient in the longitudinal direction.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 11, wherein the wall (8) of the
catchment trough (6) is constructed as a flow guidance device.
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 12, wherein the catchment trough (6)
is provided with a flap (19) or a movable wall section for discharging the solids into

the waste water stream.
A device according to claim 13, wherein the flap (18) or the wall section (22) can be
moved into the closed position of the catchment trough (6) by means of a float (20).
