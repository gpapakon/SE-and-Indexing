<ABSTRACT>
It has been discovered that any RNA can be targeted for cleavage by RNAase P from eukaryotic cells, for example, human HeLa cells, using a suitably designed oligoribonucleotide ("external guide sequence", or EGS) to form a hybrid with the target RNA, thereby creating a substrate for cleavage by RNAase P in vitro. There are two classes of EGS that can target RNA for cleavage by human RNAase P. These are prepared by transcription from a small DNA fragment that contains a sequence coding for an RNA that can assume a tRNA-like secondary structure. In the first class, the structure lacks at least the first thirteen nucleotides from the 5' terminus of the tRNA-like sequence, the anticodon stem and loop, the variable loop or part of the variable loop. The most efficient EGS with human RNAase P is the EGS in which the anticodon stem and loop was deleted. In the second class, the EGS has changes in both the equivalent of the T-loop and the anticodon stem of the tRNA-like segment of the EGS. Methods are also disclosed to randomly select and to express a suitable EGS in vivo to make a selected RNA a target for cleavage by the host cell RNAase P, thus preventing expression of the function of the target RNA. The methods and compositions should be useful to prevent the expression of disease-causing genes in vivo.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the general area of genetic 
engineering of nucleic acid sequences, especially RNA 
sequences that are substrates for Ribonuclease P. This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial 
No. 07/931,937 filed August 18, 1992 entitled 
"Targeted Cleavage of RNA Using Eukaryotic 
Ribonuclease P and External Guide Sequence", by Yan 
Yuan, Cecilia Guerrier-Takada and Sidney Altman, which 
is a continuation in part of 07/875,099 filed April 
28, 1992; which is a continuation in part of U.S. 
Serial No. 07/568,834 entitled "Therapeutic Ribozyme 
Compositions" filed August 1990 by Sidney Altman, et 
al., issued as U.S. Patent No. 5,168,053, which is a 
continuation in part of U.S. Serial No. 07/328,368 
entitled "Removing or Inactivating Undesired RNA" 
filed March 24, 1989 by Sidney Altman, Anthony C. 
Forster, and Cecilia L. Guerrier-Takada, now 
abandoned. The United States government may have certain 
rights in this invention as a result of grants from 
the National Institutes of Health and National Science 
Foundation, GM 19422 and DMB 9101670 to Sidney Altman. Discoveries in the realm of molecular biology 
over the past five years have led to the realization 
that RNA has a series of distinct capabilities and 
biological activities previously unsuspected. The 
most important of these novel RNA-level discoveries 
has been the finding that RNA can be an enzyme as well 
as an information carrier. There are several classes of ribozymes now known 
which are involved in the cleavage and/or ligation of 
RNA chains. A ribozyme is defined as an enzyme which 
is made of RNA, most of which work on RNA substrates. 
Ribozymes have been known since 1982, when Cech and  
 
colleagues (Cell, 31: 147-157) showed that a ribosomal 
RNA precursor in Tetrahymena, a unicellular eukaryote, 
undergoes cleavage catalyzed by elements in the RNA 
sequence to be removed during the conversion of the 
rRNA precursor into mature rRNA. This sequence to be 
removed (called an intervening sequence or intron) is 
one of what are now known to be numerous examples of 
"Class I" intron ribozyme activities. A similar 
"Class II" intron ribozyme mechanism was discovered 
more recently, involving the cleavage and subsequent 
ligation of a number of yeast mitochondrial RNAs 
(Nature, 324: 429-433 1987). Cech and colleagues 
described certain in vitro applications of "class I" 
ribozymes in PCT/US887/03161 by University Patents, 
Inc., (published as WO 88/04300 16 June 1988). Their 
potential for therapeutic applications in cells
