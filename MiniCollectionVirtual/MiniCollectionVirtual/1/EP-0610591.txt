<ABSTRACT>
A printing equipment accessory, especially for testing proof prints, is specified, having at least two rollers (2, 3) forming a roller nip (4) through which at least one useful portion (5) of a film (6) taken off a supply roll (14) is guided, which film has an auxiliary portion (8) in addition to the useful portion (5), it being possible for the useful portion (5) to be transferred to a base (7) in the roller nip (4). In a device of this type, the utilisation at least of the auxiliary portion of the film is to be simplified. For this purpose, the auxiliary portion (8) of the film (6) forms a coreless reel (14).

Printing equipment accessory, in particular for
making proof prints, having at least two rolls which

form a nip and through which at least a useful
component of a film that is taken off a supply roll is

guided, the said film having an auxiliary component as
well as a useful component, it being possible for the

useful component to be transferred in the nip to a
substrate,

characterized in that

the auxiliary component (8) of the film (6, 6')
forms a centreless coil (14, 14'),
the centreless coil (14, 14') is accommodated on a
winder shaft (30) whose outside diameter can be varied,
the winder shaft (30) has at least two tube
segments (35), whose distance from the winder-shaft

axle (31) can be varied,
and in that guide rings (33), which form a stop
for the radially inward movement of the tube segments

(35), are provided on the winder-shaft axle (31).
Accessory according to Claim 1, characterized
in that a cone (41, 42), which can be moved axially

into the winder shaft (30), is provided at at least one
end of the winder shaft (30).
Accessory according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that at least one elastic clamping

ring (40), which connects all the tube segments (35),
is fastened to the inside of the tube segments (35). 
Accessory according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the guide rings (33) have slots (34), in which

projections (36) from the tube segments (35) engage.
Accessory according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the projections (36) are of web-like design.
Accessory according to Claim 4 or 5,
characterized in that the cone (41, 42) has slots (46),

which correspond to those in the guide rings (33).
Accessory according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the guide rings (33) can be

displaced axially on the winder-shaft axle.
Accessory according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that friction rings (47, 51) can be

fixed on the circumference of the winder shaft (30).
Accessory according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the winder shaft (30) is mounted in a vertical

slot (16), the friction rings (47, 51) resting on the
supply roll (9, 9') or drive rings fastened thereto.
Accessory according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the winder shaft (30) has a

magnet (49), which, if necessary, together with a
mating piece (50), holds the end of the film.
Method of recycling at least part of a film
formed from a useful component and an auxiliary

component, having the following steps:

winding up the auxiliary component as a centreless
coil on a winder shaft whose outer diameter can be

varied;
reducing the outer diameter of the winder shaft;
removing the centreless coil from the winder
shaft; and
recycling the centreless coil.
