<ABSTRACT>
An artificial heart pump includes a cylindrical 
stator (11) provided between the inner surface of a casing 

(1) and a rotor (2) so as to establish a blood flow channel 
(46) between the outer surface of the stator and the inner 

surface of the casing, and a rotating magnet (6) and a 
stationary magnet (7) differing in length in their N-S pole 

directions provided on the rotor and the stator with their 
N-S pole directions aligned parallel with the axis of 

rotation. The boundary (6') between the N and S poles of 
the rotating magnet (6) is positioned closer to a pivot (8) 

than the boundary (7') between the N and S poles of the 
stationary magnet (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a centrifugal 
artificial heart pump for surgical implantation in a human 
patient, more specifically to a centrifugal artificial 
heart pump whose rotor is suspended in a noncontacting 
state by magnetic force. Artificial heart pumps can be classified into the 
reciprocating type, the rotary displacement type, and the 
turbo type that operates by rotational flow. Typical of 
the turbo type that operates by rotational flow is the 
centrifugal type. Artificial heart pumps of the centrifugal type 
are generally equipped with a casing, a rotor disposed 
inside the casing, a motor for rotating the rotor, a blood 
flow channel for introducing and guiding the flow of blood, 
and an impeller that rotates integrally with the rotor for 
imparting centrifugal force to the blood flowing in through 
the blood flow channel formed in the casing. The prior art centrifugal type artificial heart 
uses ball bearings for rotatably supporting the rotor 
provided with the impeller. With this system, however, 
blood flow is liable to stagnate in the vicinity of the 
ball bearing. Since the formation of stagnant blood is 
known to be a primary cause of blood coagulation  
 
(thrombogenesis), an artificial heart pump that is 
susceptible to such stagnation has a major defect. For eliminating this drawback, there have been 
proposed pumps whose rotors are suspended in a 
noncontacting state by magnetic force. U.S. Patent No. 4,688,998, for example, teaches 
a pump whose rotor is suspended by electromagnets. The 
pump's magnetic suspension system constantly maintains the 
rotor in the proper attitude by regulating the current 
supplied to the electromagnets so as to control their 
magnetic force. With this system for supporting the rotor 
by the force of electromagnets, however, there is a danger 
that anomalies arising in the control system during pump 
operation may disturb the attitude of the rotor and, as a 
result, disrupt the normal flow of blood. For overcoming this problem, there was proposed 
a pump according to the preamble of claim 1 shown in Figure 4 which uses 
permanent magnets for suspending the rotor. As shown, the pump's 
rotor 21 is provided with permanent magnets 22 and its 
casing 26 is provided with permanent magnets 23, with like 
poles of the two sets of permanent magnets facing each 
other so as to magnetically suspend the rotor 21. In 
addition, a pivot 25 is formed on the rear surface of an 
impeller 24 provided at one end of the rotor 21. The rotor 
21 and the impeller 24 are
