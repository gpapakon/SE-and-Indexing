<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a piling apparatus for driving a 
tube (1) closed at the lower end by a base plate into the 

ground (6) to form a concrete foundation pile. The apparatus 
comprises a piling hammer with falling weight (4) and an 

impact cap (3) acting on the tube (1). The tube (1), at the 
lower end thereof in the vicinity of the base plate (6), is 

provided with an inwardly thickened edge (2), while the piling 
hammer (3,4,5) is provided within the tube (1) and has an 

impact cap (3) resting in a centred position on both the 
thickened edge (2) and the bottom plate (6), said piling 

hammer (3,4,5) comprising a self-centring guide device 
(9,10,11) acting on the inner surface of the tube (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a piling apparatus for
driving a tube closed at the lower end by a base plate into
the ground to form a concrete foundation pile, which
apparatus comprises
a piling hammer with falling weight, provided within the
tube andan impact cap resting in a centred position on the base
plate, while between the conical impact cap and the lower
edge of the tube, a set of wedge-shaped segments is provided,
evenly distributed along the circumference for transmitting
the piling energy produced by the falling weight to the base
plate and the edge of the tube.Such piling apparatus is known from GB-A-561,765.From practice a piling apparatus has been known for
many years, the piling hammer of which is positioned on the
upper edge of the tube. The tube is driven thereby into the
ground to reach the desired depth by means of a falling
weight which is controllable in vertical direction.
Subsequently, a reinforcement is provided in the tube and the
tube is filled with concrete, after which the tube is
withdrawn from the ground under vibration, using a vibrator.This method for manufacturing concrete foundation
piles has proved to be highly reliable in a technical sense.
Objections to this method have been raised on account of the
fact that noise pollution is caused during piling, which
amply exceeds the limits of environmental legislation, that
is becoming more and more stringent. When piling blows are
applied to the head of the tube, this tube will act as a
resonance box, causing a sound emission that is
environmentally unacceptable.The piling apparatus according to above mentioned
GB-A-561,765 shows, in operation, a substantially lower sound 
emission remaining below the maximum sound level allowed by
law, so that this piling apparatus can also be used in
densely populated areas. However, the tube is intended to
remain permanently in the ground, together with the impact
cap and the wedge-shaped segments, in order to be filled with
concrete.The object of the present invention is to provide a
piling apparatus of the above type, which, when pulled out of
the tube takes along all parts necessary for transmitting the
piling energy to the base plate and the inner tube wall.According to the invention this object is realised by
providing a piling apparatus wherein the tube at the lower
end thereof in the vicinity of the base plate is provided
with an inwardly thickened edge of slightly conical shape,
while the wedge-shaped segments with their radially outwardly
directed edges abut against said thickened

<CLAIMS>
A piling apparatus for driving a tube (1) closed at the
lower end by a base plate (6) into the ground to form a

concrete foundation pile, which apparatus comprises

a piling hammer (4, 5) with falling weight (4), provided
within the tube (1) and
an impact cap (3) resting in a centred position on the base
plate (6), while between the conical impact cap (3) and the

lower edge (2) of the tube (1), a set of wedge-shaped segments
(25) is provided, evenly distributed along the circumference

for transmitting the piling energy produced by the falling
weight (4) to the base plate (6) and the edge (2) of the

tube (1),

characterized in that

   the tube (1) at the lower end thereof in the vicinity of
the base plate (6) is provided with an inwardly thickened edge

(2) of slightly conical shape while the wedge-shaped segments
(25) with their radially outwardly directed edges (18) abut

against said thickened edge (2), are pressed against the impact
cap (3) by means of at least two circular springs (19) and

suspended from the piling hammer (4, 5), said hammer comprising
a self-centring guide device (9, 10, 11), acting on the inner

surface of the tube (1).
A piling apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that the self-centring guide device (9, 10, 11) consists of a 

guide bush (11) mounted on the upper end of the guide tube (5)
for the falling weight (4), over which a slide sleeve (10) is

slidable under spring pressure (12), while, further, a set of
guide rollers (9) are present, connected to the bush (11) and

the sleeve (10) via pivotable arms (20, 21), each of said guide
rollers (9) being capable of being pressed radially outwards

against the inner wall of the tube (1) by the spring pressure
(12) exerted on the sleeve (10).
A piling apparatus acording to any of claims 1-2,
characterized in that between the bottom plate (6) and the end

portion of the tube (1) proximal to the bottom plate (6) a
slightly compressible ring (7) is provided.
An apparatus according tot any one of claims 1-3,
characterized in that the radially outwardly directed edges

(18) of the wedge-shaped segments (25) are provided with a
rough, hardened surface.
