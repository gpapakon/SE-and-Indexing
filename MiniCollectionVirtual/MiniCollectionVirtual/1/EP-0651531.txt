<ABSTRACT>
A communication method wherein rate of information transfer with a
given signal transmitted or received at a transceiver node (e.g. 101) is dynamically

varied as a function of the relative quality of the transmission environment. The
method employs a responsive buffering process (in 107) at each communication

node that permits this rate to be varied somewhat independently of the rate at which
information is transferred to or from the transceiver node. In a particular application,

the invention permits information to be exchanged between a wireless signal (from
116) having a variable error correction bandwidth and a fixed bandwidth data stream

(108,115,111).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of
transmitting information within a communication system.For field managers, as well as field sales and service personnel, the ability
to conveniently and rapidly transmit and/or receive messages to and from a central data
base is essential. However, the mobile nature of these and many other occupations makes
access to wireline terminals impractical, if not impossible. Modem wireless two-way
messaging systems, such as commercial remote data terminal networks, are directed to
supporting the mobile data messaging needs of such professionals as they travel about the
coverage area of the messaging network. These networks typically operate within the
frequency range reserved for cellular communications, and require a bandwidth on the
order of 25 MHz.Within such networks, users employ transportable field transceivers to
contact one or more regional processors, and thereby gain access to the network and a
central application host/database. Typically, as a user moves about the coverage area,
signals traveling between the mobile and regional processors are subject to fading (i.e.,
random signal variations usually induced by atmospheric conditions and/or the surrounding
topography). These variations can introduce bit errors into the data being passed to and
from the mobile transceiver. The standard protocols and relatively unintelligent regional
processors employed within the networks dictate that a substantial fixed portion of the
transmission bandwidth be dedicated to error correction. This naturally reduces the
bandwidth available to a user for sending and receiving information. The error correction
afforded by this information bandwidth reduction is indeed necessary when a user is in an
area where fading is evident. However, in an environment where fading is minimal or
zero, successful transmission and reception of information can be accomplished with
reduced error correction. If the percentage of bandwidth dedicated to error correction were
to be dynamically adjusted in response to the relative fading a user was experiencing, the
information bandwidth could be maximized. This type of dynamic bandwidth management
is employed within certain facsimile machine protocols, so that if the telephonic connection
between two facsimile machines is of high quality (i.e., induces minimal bit errors) the
amount of error correction is reduced, and the bandwidth afforded to information
transmission is increased. Unfortunately, current wireless two-way data networks are
unable to employ

A method for transmitting information within a communication system
comprising a field transceiver node (116), a base transceiver node (101) and a regional

control processor, "RCP", node (107); said method being 
CHARACTERIZED BY:
transmitting information between said field transceiver node (116) and said base
transceiver node (101) at a variable data rate via a fixed bandwidth information channel,

wherein said variable data rate is a function of the transmission quality afforded by said
fixed bandwidth information channel, and wherein, prior to the transmission of said information

between said field transceiver node (116) and said base transceiver node (101), the

transmitted between said field transceiver node (116) and said base transceiver node
