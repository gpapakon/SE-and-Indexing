<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an article of manufacture or polishing pad (10) for altering a surface of a workpiece, such as polishing or planarizing a semiconductor device. The article includes a polymeric matrix (14) impregnated with a plurality of polymeric microelements (16), each polymeric microelement having a void space (22) therein. The article has a work surface (18) and a subsurface proximate to the work surface. When the article is in contact with a working environment, polymeric microelements (16) at the work surface of the article are less rigid than polymeric elements embedded in the surface. As the work surface of the article is abraded during use, the work surface of the pad may be continuously regenerated. In alternative preferred embodiments, the work surface may further include a minitexture and/or a macrotexture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polymeric
substrate impregnated with polymeric microelements
and methods of making and using the same and, more
particularly, to an article of manufacture for use
in polishing materials, such as semiconductor
devices.Conventional polymeric substrates or
polishing pads used for polishing, planarizing and
other operations for which the present article is
useful may be subjected to a variety of operating
conditions which influence the selection of the
substrate material. For example, variations in the
nature of the workpiece being polished, polishing
speed and pressure, elevated temperatures generated
during the polishing operation, and the nature of
any polishing slurry used in the operation may
influence the choice of substrates.Conventional polymeric polishing pads
often vary in quality due to imprecise control of
polymerization and blending processes and cutting
and shaping of the final pad product. Therefore,
the polishing characteristics imparted to a 
workpiece being polished, such as surface quality,
stock removal rate and planarization rate,
typically vary greatly between pad batches.Conventional polishing pads are generally
formed from multilayer laminations or stratified
substrates having non-uniform physical properties
throughout the thickness of the pad. An example of
a typical stratified pad widely used for polishing
semiconductor devices is the Politex Supreme pad,
which is commercially available from Rodel
Incorporated, of Newark, Delaware. A typical
Politex Supreme pad is composed of several layers,
including a firm but resilient, 1 mm to 2 mm
thick, porous bottom layer comprised of a polyester
felt and polyurethane binder. A spongy and
resilient microporous urethane layer of about 0.05
mm to 0.3 mm thickness is laminated onto the bottom
layer. The top layer is comprised of vertical
urethane structures having vertical, tapered pores,
the taper of the pores narrowing toward the top of
the pad. The top layer is very soft, porous and
elastic. In a typical polishing operation, the top
layer of such a stratified pad wears rapidly. As
the top layer wears and subsequent layers are
exposed, the polishing properties of the pad vary,
resulting in non-uniform polishing rates and
producing inconsistent polishing characteristics on
the surface of the workpiece.Conventional polishing pads typically
have textured surfaces. The "microtexture" of a
pad is the intrinsic microscopic bulk texture of
the pad after manufacture. Some of the factors
which influence the static morphology
