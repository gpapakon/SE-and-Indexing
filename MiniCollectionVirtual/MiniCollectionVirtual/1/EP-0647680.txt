copolycarbonate A: based on a bisphenol and a resorcinol, having 
the constituent units described by 

formula (1) 

and formula (2) 

where each R⁴ and R⁵ is independently a halogen atom or a 
monovalent hydrocarbon radical; B is -(R¹-)C(-R²)- where 

each R¹ and R² is independently a hydrogen atom or a 
monovalent hydrocarbon radical, -C(=R³)- where R³ is a 

divalent hydrocarbon radical, -O-, -S-, -SO- or -SO₂-; R⁶ is 
a hydrocarbon radical with 1-10 carbon atoms, a halide 

thereof, or a halogen atom; and each p, q and n is 
independently an integer ranging from 0 to 4 and in which 

the constituent unit in formula (2) accounts for 2-90 mole 
percent of the constituent units (1) and (2), 

and 1-50 parts by weight of (B) glass fiber 
having a mean fiber diameter of less than 10µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a glass-reinforced polycarbonate resin composition,
more specifically, a glass-reinforced resin composition in which copolymeric polycarbonate
is the base resin.Glass-reinforced polycarbonate resin is widely used as a housing material for cameras
and power tools because of its mechanical strength, rigidity, and dimensional precision.An excellent surface appearance is required in these applications in order to increase
product value.However, it is more difficult to obtain a good visual appearance from glass-reinforced
polycarbonate resin than from other resins such as glass-reinforced nylon or glass-reinforced
polyester because of conspicuous glass floaters, i.e., glass fibers that protrude
from the surface.A method of molding at high mold temperatures was used in the prior art in order to
overcome this problem, but the method was undesirable because it prolonged the molding
cycle.Methods of obtaining a good finish using finishing coatings have been carried out, but
they are disadvantageous due to the high cost of the coatings and the difficulty of obtaining
an attractive appearance by coating a surface that is already blemished by floaters.Thus, the object of the present invention is to provide a glass-reinforced polycarbonate
resin composition with improved surface appearance.The inventors discovered that a remarkably improved surface appearance could be
obtained by using copolymeric polycarbonate having a specific structure as the
polycarbonate resin and blending glass fibers no more than 10 µm in diameter with it.Thus, the present invention provides a glass-reinforced polycarbonate resin composition
characterized by the fact that it contains 99-50 parts by weight of (A) a copolymeric
polycarbonate having constituent units described by the following formula (1): 

and the following formula (2):

where each R4 and R5 is independently a halogen atom or a monovalent hydrocarbon
radical; B is -(R1-)C(-R2)- where each R1 and R2 is independently a hydrogen atom or a
monovalent hydrocarbon radical -C(=R3)-, where R3 is a divalent hydrocarbon radical,
-O-, -S-, -SO-, or -SO2-; R6 is a hydrocarbon radical with 1-10 carbon atoms, a halide
thereof, or a halogen atom; and each p, q, and n is independently an integer ranging from 0
to 4
and in which the constituent unit, (2), amounts to 2-90 mole percent of
the total combined amount of constituent units (1) and (2), and
(B) 1-50 parts by weight of glass fibers having a mean fiber diameter of no more than 10 µm.The copolymeric
