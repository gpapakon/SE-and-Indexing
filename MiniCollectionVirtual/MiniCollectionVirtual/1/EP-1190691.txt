<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an intimate napkin provided with an adhesion
member to be attached to the intimate undergarment, which member is comprised of adhesive
lines.Usually, intimate napkins are provided with only one adhesive strap to attach the
intimate napkin to the panties or any other undergarment. The adhesive strap has a
considerable area in relation to the size of the napkin.However, this arrangement presents several shortcomings, such as those listed below.First of all, the single adhesive strap causes the napkin to behave like a rigid body
when attached to the panties, preventing same to move. Since there is only one adhesive
strap, it is impossible to move only certain regions of the napkin, and a trend of shearing
efforts of the napkin in relation to the panties, known as "shear", causes the napkin to be fully
detached from the panties.Secondly, the process for applying the adhesive element having a single strap is
complicated and requires constant adjustments and interferences in the applying machine so
that a satisfactory operation can be performed. Even though, failures are frequent in this
process, in view of the formation of certain regions where the adhesive is not applied.
Despite the fact that most of the time such regions do not prevent the correct attachment of the
napkin to the panties, the result is a sense of lack of quality, which might disencourage the use
of the product.Thirdly, the displacement of the adhesive in relation to the napkin might occur due to
failures when the same is applied. The displacement forms bubbles at the time the adhesive
protecting film is removed, seriously jeopardizing the ability of the napkin to adhere to the
panties and thus the efficiency thereof.A known technique which is relevant to the present invention is described in document
WO00/37015, which discloses an absorbent product, such as an intimate napkin, comprising a
protecting film of the product adhesive strap adhered through a pressure sensitive adhesive to
the outer end of the product. In order to enable the easy removal of the protecting film and
keep suitable levels of the product fixation to the user's undergarment, the strength between
the protecting film and the outer end of the product ("peel") should range between 0.5 and 1
Newton. The object of the present invention is to provide an intimate napkin having a
multiplicity of thin adhesive lines, thus allowing a greater movement of the napkin when in
use, however preventing the same from being detached from the user's

<CLAIMS>
An intimate napkin, comprising a substantially planar and elongated frame (3, 3')
having an outer impervious material layer, an absorbing core (2) inserted in the frame (3,3')

and an adhesive layer applied to the impervious material layer, the napkin (1,1'),
characterized in that the adhesive layer is comprised of at least five stretches of adhesive (4)

substantially spaced apart.
The napkin as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the stretches of adhesive
comprise adhesive lines (4) substantially parallel to one another, arranged substantially

longitudinally in the frame (3,3').
The napkin, as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that it comprises from
five to twenty-five adhesive lines (4).
The napkin, as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that it comprises twelve
adhesive lines (4).
The napkin, as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the
stretches of adhesive comprise the adhesive lines (4) substantially transverse, perpendicular

and or inclined to one another, which are arranged in substantially transverse, perpendicular
and or inclined directions to the longitudinal length of the frame (3,3').
The napkin, as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that it further
comprises two tabs (5) projecting substantially outwardly from the two main ridges of the

frame (3').
The napkin, as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that each of the tabs (5) has at
least two adhesive stretches of tab (6) substantially spaced apart.
The napkin, as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that the adhesive stretches of the
tab comprise adhesive lines of tab (6) substantially parallel to one another which are arranged

substantially longitudinally in the tabs (5).
The napkin, as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 8, characterized in that the
adhesive stretches of the tab comprise adhesive lines of tab (6) substantially transverse,

perpendicular and or inclined to one another, arranged in substantially transverse,
perpendicular and or inclined directions to the substantially longitudinal length of the tabs (5).
The napkin, as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 9, characterized in that the
adhesive lines are millimeter wide and the spacing between the lines is 1.2 millimeter.
