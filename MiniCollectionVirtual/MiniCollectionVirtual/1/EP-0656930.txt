<DESCRIPTION>
Diesel fuel, (a mixture of a variety of hydrocarbons, mainly aliphatic, but in
which aromatics may be present at up to twenty to twenty-five weight percent of the fuel),
which also includes kerosine or gas oil, and which is commonly used in motor vehicles, has a
tendency to foam profusely when it is poured into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. It is
therefore desirable to reduce such foaming, which can be accomplished by the addition of a
defoamer. Currently, defoamers comprise organosilicone copolymers with the silicon (Si)
content present at about 8-16 weight percent. Said defoamers have been added at about 10 to
20 parts per million (ppm) to the diesel fuel. Thus, the amount of silicon introduced to the
engine system of the motor vehicle has been at 0.80 to 1.20 ppm; however, satisfactory
performance has been achieved only at a silicon concentration of at least 1.2 ppm.Motor vehicle manufacturers have found that this level of silicon in the engine
system has a negative impact on the vehicle performance. Some difficulties which this silicon
level presents are clogging the fuel filter, forming deposits on fuel injectors and the
sedimentation of sludge in the fuel tank. Moreover, oil companies treat diesel fuel with
organic additives, such as detergents, cetane improvers, viscosity breakers and occasionally
perfumes (collectively referred to as "DAP"). Each oil company has its own preferred DAP
which it typically uses only for mixing with its own fuel. All of these organic additives must be
compatible with the defoamer, which is more difficult to achieve with defoamers with a
relatively high silicon content. Diesel fuels delivered to filling stations also may contain some amount of
dispersed or dissolved water which can adversely affect the performance characteristics of
previously known defoamers. The water causes a decay in defoaming characteristics and in
some extreme cases, may cause the defoamer to enhance foaming, rather than suppress it.
Such wet defoamers also can result in increased sludge deposition in the fuel tank.United States Patent No. 4,690,688 issued to Adams etal. discloses a typical
prior art polysiloxane for use as a defoamer, wherein the polysiloxane is a copolymer with
polyether unsaturated side chains that provide at least 25 weight percent of the copolymer.
Said material contains about 16 weight percent silicon. Also known in the prior art are
commercially available defoamers of silicone of the family of copolymers of
Me3Si(OSiMe2)x(OSiMeR)yOSiMe3, wherein R is
