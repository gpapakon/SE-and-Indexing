<ABSTRACT>
A method of measuring the silver ion activity of 
a mixed halide solution or dispersion comprises 

measuring the potential difference between a silver 
halide coated silver electrode (2) and a reference 

electrode (3) immersed in the solution or dispersion. 
Prior to measuring the potential difference an 

electrical pulse is applied to the silver electrode 
which in a first phase electrochemically strips the 

electrode surface and in a second phase 
electrochemically coats the electrode with a silver 

halide having the halide ion ratio of the solution or 
dispersion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for measuring the silver ion activity of halide 
solutions and dispersions. In electroanalytical measurements, a sensing 
electrode is used in combination with a reference 
electrode. When both electrodes are immersed in a 
solution of an ionic salt, a potential difference is 
established between the electrodes whose magnitude is 
a function of the concentration of the dissolved ionic 
species. In measuring silver ion activity in a halide 
solution or dispersion, a bare silver electrode will 
respond to the silver ion activity but will respond 
relatively slowly to changes in halide ion activity. 
The response can be increased by coating the surface 
of the silver electrode with a layer of the silver 
halide. The silver ion activity at the electrode 
surface is, therefore, directly affected by changes in 
halide ion activity in accordance with the solubility 
product of the silver halide. Potentiometric methods are known for measuring 
the equilibrium silver ion activity in mixed silver 
halide solutions and dispersions. Two methods have 
been used in process control environments where the 
halide ion is in excess and the silver ion activity is 
relatively small. One method employs a silver electrode which has 
been coated with a layer of silver halide either 
chemically or electrochemically. This electrode will 
respond to the particular halide coated and hence give 
the silver ion activity in equilibrium with the 
particular halide coated. Good precision, accuracy 
and a fast response time are obtained in solutions or  
 
dispersions consisting of the halide ion coated. 
However, in solutions or dispersions of mixed silver 
halide, the electrode coating is chemically changed to 
reflect the new ratio of halide ions and takes several 
minutes to settle to the correct value for the 
equilibrium silver activity. This type of electrode 
is unsuitable for process control of mixed halide 
solutions or dispersions. A second method uses a membrane of silver halide 
where the electrode contact is either directly made to 
the rear of the membrane or is made via a filling 
solution containing an electrode with a fixed 
potential. A membrane or pellet is prepared from 
either particles of a single silver halide or from a 
mixture containing two or more halides and possibly 
silver sulphide. The membrane electrode has a smaller 
surface area to be chemically changed and therefore 
responds slightly more quickly than the previously 
described electrode. However, due
