<ABSTRACT>
Picture display device comprising a plurality of electron transport ducts 
for transporting electrons in the form of electron currents, and selection electrodes for 

withdrawing each electron current at predetermined locations from its transport duct and 
for directing said current towards a luminescent screen. The selection electrodes are 

driven by a selection driver comprising integrated driver circuits having outputs which 
are DC-coupled to the selection electrodes and are cascaded as regards their power 

supply voltages in such a way that they apply both selection pulses and transport (bias) 
voltage to the selection electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a picture display device having a selection 
structure for the passage of electrons via extraction locations which communicate row 
by row with electron transport ducts and with selection electrodes associated with the 
extraction locations and being coupled to a selection driver. A picture display device of this type is described in European Patent 
Application no. 92204007.6 (PHN 13.963) and may comprise a display unit of the flat-panel 
type as disclosed in European Patent Applications EP-A 0 400 750 and EP-A 0 
436 997. Display units of the flat-panel type are constructions having a transparent face 
plate and, arranged at a small distance therefrom, a rear plate, which plates are 
interconnected by means of partitions and in which the inner side of the face plate is 
provided with pixels in the form of a phosphor pattern, one side of which is provided 
with an electrically conducting coating (the combination also being referred to as 
luminescent screen). If (video information-controlled) electrons impinge upon the 
luminescent screen, a visual image is formed which is visible via the front side of the 
face plate. The face plate may be flat, or if desired, curved (for example, spherical or 
cylindrical). The display unit described in European Patent Applications EP-A 0 400 
750 and EP-A 0 436 997 comprises a plurality of juxtaposed sources for emitting 
electrons, local electron transport ducts cooperating with the sources and each having 
walls of high-ohmic, electrically substantially insulating material having a secondary 
emission coefficient suitable for transporting emitted electrons in the form of electron 
currents and a selection structure comprising selectively energizable electrodes (selection 
electrodes) for withdrawing each electron current from its transport duct at 
predetermined extraction locations facing the luminescent screen, while further means 
are provided for directing extracted electrons towards pixels of the luminescent screen 
for producing a picture composed of pixels.  The operation of this known display unit is based on the recognition that 
electron transport is possible when electrons impinge on an inner wall of an elongate 
evacuated cavity (referred to as "compartment") defined by walls of a high-ohmic, 
electrically substantially insulating material (for example, glass or synthetic material), if 
an electric field of sufficient power is generated in the longitudinal direction of the 
"compartment" (by applying an electric potential

A picture display device having a selection structure for controlling the 
passage of electrons via extraction locations which communicate row by row with 

electron transport ducts and with selection electrodes associated with the extraction 
locations and being coupled to a selection driver, characterized in that the selection 

driver comprises a multiple of integrated driver circuits (300, 313, IC) each having
