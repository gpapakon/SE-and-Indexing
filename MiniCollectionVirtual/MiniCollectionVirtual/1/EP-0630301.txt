<ABSTRACT>
In a method of making an elongate object (49) with a head at one end and a point at the other end, a blank (49) is placed in a die (50) in the form of a through-going channel, following which the head end is subjected to pressure working with or against a tool (52), while a dolly (55) is kept engaged with the die (50) at its other end. A pre-formed head is first provided on the blank (49) in a manner known per se so that said head has an excess of material with respect to the size of the final head, and then a dolly (55) with a depression (56) opposite the die (50) is used, and the blank (49) is subjected to pressure working in a manner such that the pressure acting between the tool (52) and the die (50) causes flow of material in the blank (49) so that blank material flows down into the depression (56) of the dolly. In an apparatus for making an elongate object (49) having a head at one end and a point at the other end, the dolly (55) has a depression (56) in extension of the die (50) so that the pressure acting between the tool (52) and the die (50) causes flow of material in the blank (49), whereby excess of blank material flows down into the depression (56) in the dolly (55).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and an apparatus for making 
an elongate object with a head at one end and a point 
at the other end, wherein a blank is positioned in a die 
with a through-going channel of constant diameter, following which 
the head end is subjected to axial pressure working with or 
against a tool, while a bottom stop is kept engaged with the 
other end of the blank, cf. e.g. AU-B-611 748. For instance for automatic screwing-in of i.a. self-tapping 
screws it is decisive that the screws are provided 
with a so-called point, which may e.g. have the shape of a 
truncated cone at one end of the screw, while the screw 
head is provided at the opposite end of the screw. Points 
on screws can have numerous other shapes. It has been 
found difficult to produce such a point in a simple 
manner. One reason is that the screw is manufactured from 
a wire blank having blunt ends which occur as a result of 
cropping of the blank from rod-shaped or wire-shaped 
stock. When such a screw is to be made, the material of 
both blank ends is to be subjected to forming, viz. to a 
screw head and a screw point, respectively. Such a point can be made in a known method by means of a 
constriction of the die, in which the blank is retained 
while the head is formed by cooperation with the tool. 
Thus, the through-going channel of the die has a constriction. 
This means that an ejector pin having a smaller 
cross-section than the cross-section of the wire blank 
must be used for ejecting the blank from the die following 
machining. The cross-section of the ejector pin must necessarily 
correspond to the narrowest part of the point in 
order that the ejector pin can be inserted into the die 
and push the finished blank out. There is a great risk  
 
that such a thin ejector pin will bend or break when it is 
to produce the great force required to eject the blank 
from the die. In the prior art there is a transition between un-deformed 
material in the shank and deformed material in the head, 
which results in a weakening of the screw at this transition 
between head and shank. The invention provides a simple method of making a point 
on a screw blank, where there are no constrictions in the 
die, and consequently an ejector pin having the same 
cross-section as the blank may be used. Also, e.g. a slot 
may be made in the head of the screw using a smaller force 
than needed in the past. This reduces wear on the tool and 
gives a greater precision of the slot and the geometry of 
the head. It has moreover been

<CLAIMS>
A method of making an elongate object (49) having a 
head at one end and a point at the other end, wherein a 

blank (49) is placed in a die (50) with a through-going 
channel of constant diameter, 

following which the head end is subjected to 
axial pressure working with or against a tool (52), while 

a bottom stop (55) is kept engaged with the other end of the blank, 

characterized
 by first providing a preformed 
head on the blank (49) so 

that said head has an excess of material with respect to 
the size of the final head, then using a bottom stop (55) with a 

depression (56) opposite the die channel and subjecting the 
blank (49) to pressure working in a manner such that the 

pressure acting between the tool (52) and the die (50) 
causes flow of material in the blank (49) so that blank 

material flows out of the die channel and into the depression (56) of 
the bottom stop to form a pointed end. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the exertion of the axial pressure results 

in a radial, outwardly directed cold flow of a small 
amount of blank material (70) into a small cavity defined in the 

die channel. 
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized
 
in that said cavity is a radial projection (70) provided 

along the rim of the die hole which faces away from the tool. 
A method according to claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the projection is an annular bead (70). 
An apparatus for carrying out the method according to claims 1-4 
for making an elongate object (49) having 

a head at one end and a point at the other end, said apparatus 
comprising a die (50) with a through-going channel of constant 

diameter  
 

in which a blank (49) is placed for pressure working 
of the head end with or against a tool (52), and comprising 

a bottom stop (55) which is kept engaged with the 
other end of the blank, 


characterized
 in that the 
bottom stop (55) has a depression (56) in extension of the die channel 

so that the pressure acting between the tool (52) and 
the die (50) causes flow of material in the blank (49), 

whereby blank material flows out of the die channel and into the depression 
(56) in the bottom stop (55) to form a pointed end. 
An apparatus according to claim 5, 
characterized
 
in that the die (67) defines at least one depression 

to receive a relatively small amount of blank material 
(70) during forming of the blank by the tool. 
An apparatus according to claim 6, 
characterized
 
in that the cavity is provided between the bottom 

stop (68) and a bevel of the rim of the die 
hole which faces away from the tool.
