<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and 
apparatus or delivering a physiologically active 
compound to a target human or animal. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to methods 
and apparatus for delivering physiologically active 
compounds to a target human or animal using 
supercritical fluid solutions comprising a 
supercritical fluid solvent and a physiologically 
active solute. Various methods of drug administration are known 
in the art, including hypodermic delivery, oral 
delivery and nasal delivery. Hypodermic delivery of 
drugs is disadvantageous in that it can cause localized 
damage to arteries from repeated injections, create 
highly concentrated doses of drugs in tissues before 
the drugs are distributed by the circulatory system, 
and increase the probability of infection from 
hypodermic use. Oral administration of drugs is 
advantageous in patient convenience, and therefore 
increases the probability of patient compliance. Nasal 
and pulmonary drug delivery methods and apparatus are 
advantageous owing to low patient discomfort, rapid  
 
drug absorption, reduced degradation of drug compounds 
by the gastrointestinal system and reduced systemic 
side effects resulting from the drugs. Conventional oral and nasal drug delivery methods 
and apparatus often employ aerosol formulations. For 
example, the Cook et al U.S. Patents Nos. 4,044,126, 
4,414,209 and 4,364,923 relate to the use of aerosol 
formulations for the adminstration of anti-inflammatory 
steroids. The Cook et al patents disclose a method for 
preparing the steroid in a crystalline form for use in 
the aerosol formulations. The Tom et al publication 
entitled "Particle Formation with Supercritical Fluids-A 
Review", Journal of Aerosol Science, Volume 22, No. 
5, pages 555-584 (1991), discloses the use of 
supercritical solutions to form particles for use in 
aerosol formulations. The Smith U.S. Patent No. 
4,582,731 and the Sievers et al U.S. Patent No. 
4,970,093 further disclose the use of supercritical 
fluids for powder and film formation, but do not relate 
particularly to powders or films of medicaments or 
drugs. The use of supercritical fluid solutions to 
form precipitates of various metal salts was first 
disclosed by Hannay et al, Chem. News, 40,256 (1879). It is also known to administer powdered 
medicaments orally or nasally. The Hallworth et al 
U.S. Patents Nos. 4,206,758 and 4,353,365 disclose 
inhalation devices by which powdered medicaments can be 
orally or nasally inhaled by a patient

A method of preparing a medicament comprising a physiologically 
active compound for 

delivery in the form of a gas-borne dispersion to a target human 
or animal, obtainable by (a) forming a supercritical fluid solution 

comprising a supercritical fluid solvent and a physiologically 
active solute; and (b) passing the supercritical fluid solution 

into a subcritical region to evaporate the solvent and form said 
gas-borne dispersion of solute particles. 
A method as defined by claim 1, wherein the 
supercritical fluid solution is formed by mixing the 

supercritical fluid solvent and the physiologically 
active solute, pressurizing the mixture above the 

critical pressure of the solvent , and heating the 
mixture above the critical temperature of the solvent. 
A method as defined by claim 1, wherein the 
supercritical fluid solution is formed by pressurizing 

the supercritical fluid solvent above its critical 
pressure, heating the solvent above its critical 

temperature, and mixing the pressurized, heated 
solvent with the physiologically active solute. 
A method as defined by claim 1, wherein the 
supercritical fluid solvent is selected from the group 

consisting of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, a 
chlorofluorocarbon, and mixtures thereof.

supercritical fluid solution further includes a 

surfactant. 
A method as defined by claim 1, wherein the 
physiologically active solute is a drug for the 

treatment of a pulmonary disorder. 
A method as defined by claim 7, wherein the

physiologically active solute is a surfactant selected 

form the group consisting of 
dipalmitoylphosphatidycholine and a fatty acid. 
A method as defined by claim 1, wherein the

have an average size of from about 0.5 µm to about 6.5 
µm.

animal, comprising (a) a first chamber containing a 
supercritical fluid solution comprising a supercritical 

fluid solvent and a physiologically active solute; (b) 
means for rapidly expanding the solution into a 

subcritical region to evaporate the solvent and form a 
gas-borne dispersion of solute particles and (c) means for

human. 
A hand-held apparatus as defined by claim 13, 
further including a second chamber containing a
