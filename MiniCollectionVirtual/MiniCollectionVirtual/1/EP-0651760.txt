<ABSTRACT>
The new triterpenoids of general formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV) where R
<
1
>
 represents a dialkyl, trialkyl, triphenyl, diphenylalkyl, alkyldiphenyl, dialkylphenyl, haloalkyl, halophenylalkyl, allylalkyl or alkylaminoalkyl group and R
<
2
>
 represents a carboxyl group, salt or ester, and a process for their preparation which comprises reaction of friedelin with a silylating agent in the presence of a bulky strong base, with kinetic or thermodynamic control, to produce regio-specifically compounds of general formula (I) or (II). Oxidation of (I) or (II) yields the corresponding hydroxy ketones (VII) or (VIII), from which acyl and glycosyl derivatives can be prepared, and further oxidation of the hydroxy ketones (VII) or (VIII) with peracid gives the seco-aldehyde acids (III) or (IV), from which esters or salts can be prepared. Ozonolysis of (I) or (II), followed by reductive treatment, produces the diols of formula (IX) or (X), from which acyl and glycosyl derivatives can be prepared. Oxidation of (I) with a benzoquinone leads to friedel-1-en-2-one (XI) in high yields. Compounds or combinations of compounds (I), (II), (III), (IV), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (X), (XII), including the acyl and glycosyl derivatives thereof, find application in fungicidal, bactericidal, antitumour and antifeedant compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for preparing friedelan triterpenoid derivatives which have
application as bioactive agents in fungicidal, bactericidal, antitumour and antifeedant
compositions, a precursor for preparing them, and a process for the
production of said precursor from friedelin obtained from cork
smoker wash solids.Cork smoker wash solids are a by-product from the manufacture of cork particle
boards, forming when cork granules are subject to compression and treatment with
super-heated steam, and it accummulates in the piping as a black waxy material
which forces operations to stop periodically for cleaning. Although cork smoker wash
solids are a superior source of friedelin (V) and 3-hydroxyfriedel-3-en-2-one (VI) (R=H)
[E. J. Corey and J. J. Ursprung, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1956, 78, 5041; I.
Ribas-Marques and J. Fernandez-Salgado, Anal. Qu√≠m., 1974, 70, 363] S. K.
Talapatra, D. K. Pradhan and B. Talapatra, Indian J. Chem., 1978, 16B, 361], up to the
present time no extraction process has been exploited for industrial application and
therefore this industrial waste has found no use, being usually destroyed by
incineration.The application of friedelin (V) has been described for the treatment of bladder
cancer [H. C. Simon, German Patent 25 08 338, 19 Feb. 1976] and cachexia due to 

carcinoma, sarcoma and leukemia [H. C. Simon, US Patent 4,444,791, 24 Apr. 1984].
Its anticonvulsive, anti-inflamatory [A. K. Chaturvedi, S.S. Parmar, S. C. Bhatnagar, G.
Mistra and S. K. Nigam, Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol., 1974, 9, 11] and
antidiuretic activities have been described [S. H. Rizvi, A. Shoeb, R. S. Kapil and S. P.
Popli, Experientia, 1980, 36, 146]. Friedelin V has been reported to exhibit antifeedant
activity for Spodoptera littoralis [M. A. Abbassy, A. El-Shazli and F. El-Gayar, Z.
Angew. Entomol., 1977, 83, 317] and Anthonomus grandis [D. H. Miles, A. M. Ly, S.
A. Randle, P. A. Hedin and M. L. Burks, J. Agric. Food Chem., 1987, 35, 794], but
these results were not confirmed by our own assay tests. Moreover, there are no
references to the use of the new and known friedelin derivatives of the present
invention as bioactive agents.Accordingly, what is needed in the art is the high yield transformation of
friedelin as isolated from cork smoker wash solids
into new derivatives, or known derivatives from other sources unavailable up to the
present in limited quantities, for application as effective bioactive agents. Quite
surprinsigly, the present invention fulfills these needs. The
