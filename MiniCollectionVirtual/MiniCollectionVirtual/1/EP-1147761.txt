<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a lipstick
composition which drastically improves the color

development and also is superior in terms of
spreadability, gloss, and long-lastingness.
The present invention also provides a lipstick
composition with superior a shape-retaining ability

without using ceresin for the shape-retaining agent.
The present invention is a lipstick composition

comprising (a) 3-25 mass % of one, two or more types
of polyethylene wax (average molecular weight

300-700) and (b) 0.1-50 mass % of one, two or more
types of liquid oil having one -0H group in the

structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lipstick composition. More particularly, the present invention relates to a lipstick composition with superior spreadability, gloss, and long-lastingness. In addition, the present invention relates to a lipstick composition with a superior shape-retaining ability.A lipstick is applied to the lips to put a color and gloss to the lips to draw charm; it is recognized as one of the makeup cosmetics with the highest cosmetic effect. "Color development" is one of the functions desired from a lipstick. Generally, wax, various liquid oils, powder which contains a colorant, and perfume are blended into a lipstick composition used for a lipstick; the combination helps maintain the spreadability, gloss, color development, long-lastingness, etc. which constitute the basic usability of a lipstick in relation to the aforementioned functions related to the quality.The object of the present invention is to provide a lipstick composition which drastically improves the color development related to the basic usability of a lipstick and also is superior in terms of spreadability, gloss, and long-lastingness.Also, the object of the present invention is to provide a lipstick composition with a superior shape-retaining ability, essentially without using ceresin which conventionally is used as a shape-retaining agent.The inventors conducted earnest research to solve the aforementioned problem and discovered that a lipstick composition which drastically improves the color development and also is superior in terms of spreadability, gloss, and long-lastingness can be obtained by using polyethylene with a specific molecular weight for the wax ingredient and combining this with a specific liquid oil ingredient in a specific quantity ratio, thus completing the present invention.In other words the present invention relates to a lipstick composition comprising (a) 3-25 mass % of one, two or more types of polyethylene wax (average molecular weight 300-700) and (b) 0.1-50 mass % of one, two or more types of liquid oil having one -OH group in the structure chosen from glyceryl diisostearate, diglyceryl triisostearate and isostearyloxy stearate, and additionally containing (c) microcrystalline wax such that the wall ratio of (a) : (c) = 6:4 - 9:1.In the present invention, a lipstick composition refers to a broad range of compositions used for a lipstick which is a makeup cosmetic; it can take any form such as a stick, pencil, ointment, or liquid.
