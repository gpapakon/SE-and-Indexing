<ABSTRACT>
An alloyed hot dip galvanized steel plate having high press 
workability and excellent plating separation resistance. The 

alloyed hot dip galvanized steel plate is obtained by forming an 
alloyed hot dip galvanized layer which contains 9 - 12 weight % 

of Fe and 0.3 - 1.5 weight % of Al and about 0.1 weight % or less of Pb 
on the surface of a ultra-low-carbon 

steel plate so that the amount of the adhesion thereof is 
from 25g/m² - 70g/m².

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alloyed hot dip 
galvanized steel sheet which is used for external vehicle body 
plates having excellent pressing workability and plating 
separation resistance. Recently, increased anticorrosive properties for vehicle 
bodies have been demanded. Industry has therefore been trying to 
develop adequate galvanized surface treatment steel sheets to 
meet these demands. One development has been hot dip galvanized 
steel sheets, which are economically excellent. Further, it has 
become possible to improve weldability and corrosion resistance 
after coating steel sheets by composing a plating layer of Fe-Zn 
(alloyed hot dip galvanized steel plate) and subjecting it to 
heat treatment. Higher ductility (elongation El) and higher drawability 
(Lankford value, r value) have also been demanded because alloyed 
hot dip galvanized steel sheets used for external vehicle body 
sheets (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "GA") are subjected 
to high-level press processing to improve their design 
characteristics. To solve problems associated with achieving 
high ductility and high drawability, a variety of methods for 
reducing the content of C, N, P, S and the like contained in  
 
steels from the viewpoint of the property of the steel sheet as a 
material have been developed. Optimum hot rolling and cold 
rolling processes have also been developed. In conjunction with the demands for the steel sheet, the 
characteristics demanded for the plating layer of GA steel sheets 
are that the plating layer must not exhibit 1) "powdering" in 
which the structure thereof is powdered and separated because it 
cannot follow the deformation of the steel sheet during 
processing, and 2) "flaking" in which the structure is separated 
in the form of scales when it is ironed by means of pressing 
dies. If such phenomena occur, separated plated particles are 
collected in the pressing dies, thereby causing highly 
undesirable indentations on the surface of steel sheets. Also, 
the corrosion resistance of the plating itself may be lost. Generally, the plating layer of GA steel sheet is said to be 
composed of three Zn-Fe alloy phases ζ, δ1, Γ from the viewpoint 
of low percentage content of Fe. The reason for powdering is 
believed to originate from the Γ phase and the reason for flaking 
is believed to originate from the ζ phase. If GA steel sheet is 
produced by hot-dip galvanizing the C, N, P, S reduced material, 
the ductility and r value are satisfied. However, if such a 
treatment is
