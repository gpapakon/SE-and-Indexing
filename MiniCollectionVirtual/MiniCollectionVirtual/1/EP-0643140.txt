<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
determination of nucleic acid by detecting the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification product
by use of a dye compound which does not fluoresce in
the free state but fluoresces reacting with double-stranded
nucleic acid. The present invention also
relates to a method for measuring the number of
microbial cells, the number of specified genes and the
number of specified gene copies. The present invention
further relates to a measuring-kit to be utilized for
the above method. The method is useful for measuring
the number of cells of a specified microorganism in a
solution or in soil.The PCR is a method for enzymatically
amplifying a specific DNA sequence by using the
specified sequence as a template defined with two kinds
of primers. This method has become utilized in
detection of nucleic acid. Detection is conducted by
steps of selecting a specific sequence of the target 
nucleic acid, preparing a set of primers for amplifying
a specific sequence, conducting PCR by utilizing the
target nucleic acid as a template, and detecting the
amplified specific sequence. According to PCR, the
specific sequence which is characteristic of the object
to be detected is amplified with a high amplification
rate, enabling the detection of even a minute amount of
target nucleic acid in a sample. For example, the
reaction for several hours can give about 1,000,000-fold
amplification. Therefore, even one molecule of
nucleic acid can be detected by PCR. This
amplification proceeds only when the two primer
sequences have complementarity to the template nucleic
acid, and no amplification product can be obtained when
the complementary sequence is not present.Thus, PCR, which greatly improves the
sensitivity of nucleic acid detection, has come to be
utilized to detect nucleic acid in various technical
fields in place of the hybridization method:
particularly, to identify the pathogen of a virus- or
bacterial disease in clinical tests, to analyze genes
in genetic disorders, and to detect gene markers in
cancer diagnosis.Another application of PCR is in measurement of
the cell number of a certain microorganism, which is
conducted with combination of PCR with MPN (most
probable number) method, [H.O. Halvorson, and N.R. 
Ziegler: J. Bacteriol., 25 101 (1933)]. In MPN method,
which is also called the dilution count method, a
sample is serially diluted, a predetermined portion of
each sample dilution is inoculated into a culture
medium in a test tube, and incubated for a sufficient
perio
