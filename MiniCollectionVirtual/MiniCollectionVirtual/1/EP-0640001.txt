<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with placing a 
horizontally extending grid system across a plume of 
liquid contamination contained within the water table. 
The grid system will remove the plume of contamination by 
lowering the water table and evacuating the contamination 
plume. Previous attempts to remove a plume of liquid 
contamination contained below ground have included 
placement of numerous vertical wells placed around the 
periphery of the plume. The vertical wells are operated 
continuously in an attempt to draw the liquid of a 
contamination plume towards the vertical well system. 
Great amounts of water are pumped out of the ground by 
these vertical wells at a great cost and over an extended 
period of time. These plumes of liquid are known to contain such 
dangerous substances as diesel fuel, jet fuel, gasoline, 
heating oil, creosote, and other chemicals, for example. 
Sources of contamination are thousands of aging 
underground tanks buried beneath schools, government 
offices, gasoline stations, businesses and abandoned 
property distributed throughout the United States. This 
problem has often times resulted in homeowners being 
forced from their homes due to condemning of their homes 
by public officials due to the extreme hazard and health 
risks involved. The presence of these contaminants in the water table 
present a continuous potential health hazard to the 
population. Rural and suburban residents who use wells 
for the source of their drinking water are particularly 
affected by this problem. It is estimated that half of  
 
the country relies on this type of source for their drinking water. The 
removal of these contaminates is therefore required to help ensure a 
potable water supply. In 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued 
regulations requiring that new underground tanks meet minimum 
standards. Owners of older tanks were forced to close or upgrade their 
tanks. Since these regulations have been implemented, 130,000 leaks 
have been documented. Experts expect hundreds of thousands of more 
leaks to be discovered in the future. The new EPA rules have been 
estimated to apply to 1.8 million tanks nationwide. This number excludes 
millions of home heating oil, farm and other smaller underground tanks 
potentially subject to producing leaks. The US-A-4600508 describes a removal method for contaminated liquid using 
horizontal pipes.  
 In accordance with the present invention, we provide a method for 
removing a plume of contaminated liquid from the water table,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for removing a plume (14) of contaminated liquid 
from the water table, said method comprising the steps of: 


locating a plume of contaminated liquid, 
positioning a plurality of rows of substantially horizontally 
extending perforated recovery pipes (12) at a depth at least at or below 

the depth to which the plume (14) of contaminated liquid extends, 
removing water from the water table to move the plume (14) of 
contaminated liquid into contact with the recovery pipes, 
removing the plume (14) of contaminated liquid from below ground 
level by passage through the recovery pipes (12) as the plume (14) moves 

into the recovery pipes, and being characterized by 
positioning a vapour recovery system (60) above the recovery 
pipes (12) and below ground level to recover vapours generated by the 

plume (14) including substantially horizontal pipes (62) with open 
perforations. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said recovery pipes 
are positioned below the plume (14) of contaminated liquid. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein a pumping unit (20) 
forces liquid entering the recovery pipes (12) to an above ground location; 

and wherein a treatment facility treats water entered into the recovery 
pipes (12). 
A method according to claim 3, wherein the treatment 
facility is located above ground level.  

 
A method according to claim 3, wherein water treated by the 
treatment facility is returned to the site of the plume (14) of contaminated 

liquid for release above the site of the plume (14) of contaminated liquid 
so as to pass through the soil towards the site of the plume (14) of 

contaminated liquid. 
A method according to claim 5, wherein water treated by the 
treatment facility, after passing through the soil, is removed by the 

recovery pipes (12) for a second treatment at the treatment facility. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the recovery 
pipes (12) are positioned to extend across, and are buried below, the 

plume (14) of contaminated liquid. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein a volume of flow 
through the recovery pipes (12) is variable dependent upon the degree of 

contamination passing through each recovery pipe (12). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the recovery 
pipes (12) extend parallel to each other, and are substantially horizontal.
