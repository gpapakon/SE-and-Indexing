<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drive voltage
generating device for a liquid crystal display device,
which generates a drive voltage for driving a liquid
crystal display panel.Conventionally, a six-level drive system is
adopted in liquid crystal display devices of a
simple-matrix type (including liquid crystal display
devices of the same drive system such as MIM (Metal
Insulator Metal), etc.). In the six-level drive
system, a liquid crystal display panel is driven by
supplying a potential of six levels to a liquid
crystal driver from a drive voltage generating device. 
Therefore, in order to drive portable devices using
batteries, it is required to set the voltage to be
supplied to the liquid crystal driver higher than a
voltage of a self-contained battery, and also to have
potentials of six levels.First, as a technique for achieving a voltage
higher than a voltage from a power source, for
example, a method for transferring a charge in a
condenser may be used. This technique for achieving a
higher voltage is enabled, for example, from a circuit
shown in Fig. 3 of "voltage boosting circuit for
electronic watches" disclosed in Japanese Examined
Patent Publication No. 6424/1993 (Tokukohei 5-6424)
and from a circuit shown in Fig. 1 of "up-voltage
circuit" disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent
Publication No. 49822/1987 (Tokukosho 62-49822).The technique for achieving a higher voltage than
the voltage of the power source by transferring the
charge in the condenser also can be achieved from a
Cockcroft circuit shown in Fig. 2 of "portable digital
electronic device" disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publication No. 74120/1973 (Tokukaisho
48-74120), a Schankel circuit shown in Fig. 3 of
"digital electronic device" disclosed in Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 44781/1974 
(Tokukaisho 49-44781), and Cockcroft and Schankel
circuits shown in Fig. 2 of "digital electronic
device" disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 35074/1974 (Tokukaisho 49-35074).However, all of the described voltage boosting
circuits are designed for achieving a higher voltage
than an original voltage generated from the power
source and a potential of one level using a single
power source and a condenser. Therefore, it is
difficult to modify the circuits so as to supply
potentials of 6 levels to the liquid crystal driver.In order to solve the above problem, as another
technique for achieving potentials of 6 levels from
the single power source, for example, as shown in Fig.
10, a method for supplying a voltage
