<ABSTRACT>
Impurities such as halides and ammonia are 
efficiently removed from a gas containing SO
x
 at a high 
concentration without any substantial addition of fresh 

water in a process for purifying a sulfur oxides-containing 
gas, which comprises passing a gas 

containing sulfur oxides at a high concentration 
successively through a first washing column and a 

second washing column, thereby water washing the gas 
through the two washing columns to remove the 

impurities from the gas, by setting an outlet 
temperature of the gas from the first washing column to 

a temperature at which the gas can have a maximum water 
content or a temperature near this temperature and 

setting an outlet temperature of the gas from the 
second washing column at least by 20°C lower than the 

outlet temperature of the gas from the first washing 
column.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for purifying a
gas containing sulfur dioxide in high concentration.A gas containing sulfur oxides (SOx) at a
high concentration is obtained by contacting a flue gas
with a carbonaceous adsorbent, thereby removing sulfur
oxides or sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides from the
flue gas and regenerating the sulfur oxides-adsorbed
carbonaceous adsorbent with heating. Elemental sulfur
is recovered from the gas containing SOx at a high
concentration, for example, by a reduction treatment of
the gas according to Claus process. In case of a flue
gas from combustion of fuel coal, the gas containing
SOx at a high concentration also contains halides
originating from sea water sprayed over fuel coal to
prevent coal dust generation before combustion.
Furthermore, when ammonia is added to a flue gas to
conduct removal of nitrogen oxides therefrom, most of
ammonia adsorbed on the carbonaceous adsorbent, which
also works as a catalyst for removing nitrogen oxides,
is decomposed to a nitrogen gas during the regeneration
of the adsorbed carbonaceous adsorbent with heating,
whereas undecomposed ammonia is contained in the gas 
containing SOx at a high concentration.These impurities such as halides and ammonia
give rise to corrosion of the Claus process apparatus
or poisoning of a reducing catalyst in the reactor of
the Claus process apparatus, resulting in frequent
shutdown of the Claus process apparatus. It is thus
necessary to remove these impurities, thereby purifying
a flue gas containing SOx at a high concentration
before the flue gas is passed through the Claus process
apparatus.It has been proposed to purify a gas
containing SOx at a high concentration by leading the
gas at a temperature of 200°C or higher to a single
washing column and cooling and washing the gas with
recirculating water sprayed into the washing column at
the upper part, thereby removing impurities such as
halides and ammonia (JP-B-5-21008). However, the
proposed process has such problems that the impurities
such as halides and ammonia are gradually absorbed and
accumulated in the recirculating water, lowering the
washing efficiency with time, and in order to suppress
the lowering of washing efficiency with time it is
necessary to supply fresh water, resulting in an
increase in the amount of waste water to be treated
separately.It is also known to purify a gas containing
SOx at a high concentration through a series of two
washing columns, where the gas at a temperature of 
200°C or higher is quenched in a

<CLAIMS>
A process for purifying a gas containing
sulfur dioxide at a high concentration, which comprises

passing a gas containing sulfur dioxide at a high
concentration and sulfur trioxide, halogen compounds,

ammonia and other impurities to a first water washing
column and then to a second water washing column of a

set of two water washing columns connected in series,
thereby removing the sulfur trioxide, halogen

compounds, ammonia and other impurities therefrom, the
first and second water washing columns being provided

each with a washing water recycle system, each having an
independent pump and only the second water washing column being

provided with a cooling system for washing water,
while setting an outlet temperature of

the gas from the first washing column to a temperature
at which the gas can have a maximum water content or a

temperature near this temperature and setting an outlet
temperature of the gas from the second washing column

at least by 20°C lower than the outlet temperature of
the gas from the first washing column, so that said first and

second washing treatment are carried out without any
substantial supply of fresh water from the outside. 
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the
outlet temperature of the gas from the first washing

column is set to 65° - 90°C, and the outlet temperature
of the gas from the second washing column is set to not

higher than 50°C, while keeping the outlet temperature
of the gas from the second washing column at least by

20°C lower than the outlet temperature of the gas from
the first washing column.
