<ABSTRACT>
Safety gripper for rail-mounted equipment, e.g. a crane, consisting of gripper arms movable about fixed hinge points attached to a support. The gripper arms carry pressure jaws at one end, if need be via intermediate members adjustable in an articulated manner, and are actuated at the other end by an actuating device attached to a frame, groove guides (18, 19 or 30, 31) being provided on the inside of at least one pressure jaw (15, 16 or 28). The groove guides (18, 19 or 30, 31) are arranged in mirror image and run in a wedge shape to the rail (17). Guided in the groove guides (18, 19 or 30, 31) are wedges (21, 22, 21a, 22a or 32, 33) which take hold of the rail (17) and can be moved towards one another by spring force.

Safety tongs for a rail mounted installation, e.g. a crane with tongs arms 
hinged movably on fixed hinge points arranged on a support, whereas the 

tongs' arms bearing cheek plates at one end, preferrably via adjustably 
hinging connecting links, which are actuated by an operating device 

arranged on a frame at the other end of the tongs' arms, whereas at least 
one guiding groove heading key-like for the rail is provided on the inner 

side of at least one cheek plate, in which a key is guided for taking hold 
of the rail, whereas the key is bringable into the area of the biggest 

opening width of the guiding groove,
characterized in that
 
a frame (42) is provided for receiving the rail tongs, whereas the tongs' 

arms (35, 36) are movably receivable by the frame (42). 
Safety tongs according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
symmetrically arranged guiding grooves (30, 31) heading key-like for the 

rail (17) are provided on the inner side of at least one cheek plate (28), in 
which keys (32, 33) taking hold of the rail (17) are guided, which are 

movable towards each other by means of the spring's force. 
Safety tongs according to one of the above-mentioned claims,
characterized in that
 
the cheek plates (28, 29) are hinged on tongs' arms (35,36), whereas the 

tongs' arms (35, 36) are connected via a piston-cylinder actuation (39), 
and whereas a pressure spring (40) is provided parallel to the piston-cylinder 

actuation (39).  
 
Safety tongs according to one of the above-mentioned claims,
characterized in that
 
the cheek plate (28, 26) is connectable with the corresponding tongs' arm 

(35, 36) by means of a ball- and socket-joint (43, 44). 
Safety tongs according to one of the above-mentioned claims,
characterized in that
 
the guiding groove (30, 31) is bent towards the rail (17), in order to 

increase the pressure exerted onto the rail (17) by the keys (32, 33) 
guided in the guiding groove (30, 31). 
Safety tongs according to claim 5,
characterized in that
 
the bending (at 45) starts from approximately half of the length of the 

guiding groove (30, 31). 
Safety tongs according to one of the above-mentioned claims,
characterized in that
 
only one cheek plate (28) is provided with keys (32, 33). 
Safety tongs according to one of the above-mentioned claims,
characterized in that
 
the piston-cylinder actuation (39) works against the force of the pressure 

spring (40). 
Safety tongs according to one of the above-mentioned claims,
characterized in that
 
the piston-cylinder actuation (39) comprises a one-way valve.  

 
Safety tongs according to one of the above-mentioned claims,
characterized in that
 
the keys (32, 33) are held in their respective starting position by means of 

one pressure spring (34, 46) each. 
Safety tongs according to one of the above-mentioned claims,
characterized in that
 
the pressure spring is guided by the key (32, 33) and is supported by the 

cheek plate (28).
