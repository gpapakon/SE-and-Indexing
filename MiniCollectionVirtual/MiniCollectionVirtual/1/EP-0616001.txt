<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to solutions of 
hydrogen silsesquioxane resin which are stable on extended 
storage. These stable solutions are obtained by 
incorporating small amounts of acids in the solution. Hydrogen silsesquioxane resin (H-resin) is known in 
the art to be a useful precursor to silica-containing ceramic 
coatings. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,756,977 describes 
a process for forming such a coating in which H-resin is 
diluted in a solvent, applied to a substrate and ceramified 
by heating. Various methods for producing H-resin are also 
known in the art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,615,272 
describes a process which comprises adding trichlorosilane to 
a reaction medium comprising sulfuric acid and an aromatic 
hydrocarbon, washing the reaction mixture until neutral and 
recovering the condensed H-resin. Despite the fact that the 
reference teaches hydrolysis and condensation in an acid, the 
resultant product is neutralized to prevent gelation. U.S. Patent No. 5,010,159 teaches a similar process 
in which a hydridosilane is reacted in an arylsulfonic acid 
hydrolysis medium followed by separating the resultant 
H-resin and then contacting it with a neutralizing agent. The shelf life of the above solvent-diluted 
H-resins can be unreliable if the resin undergoes crosslinking 
and increases in molecular weight. We have now found 
that the incorporation of an acid in the H-resin solution 
limits the possibility of changes in the molecular weight of 
the resin.  
 The present invention provides a method of stabilising 
a hydrogen silsesquioxane resin solution comprising 0.1 to 
100 parts by weight hydrogen silsesquioxane resin in 100 
parts by weight solvent characterised in that 0.002 to 4 
parts by weight acid are added to said resin solution. At the time of our invention, the predominant 
thought within the prior art was that solutions of H-resin 
must be completely neutralized to prevent any degree of 
gelation during storage. This belief was a substantial 
prejudice against the applicant's present claims which are 
based upon our unexpected finding that such solutions can, in 
fact, be stabilized for storage by the addition of small 
amounts of acids. As used in this disclosure, the expressions 
"stable" or "stabilized" H-resin solutions are used to 
describe those solutions in which the molecular weight of the 
H-resin changes less over time than those which have not been 
stabilized. It is preferred that the "stable" solutions not 
gel. It is more preferred that the weight
