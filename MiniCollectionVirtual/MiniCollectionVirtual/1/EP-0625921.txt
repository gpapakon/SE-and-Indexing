<ABSTRACT>
Granulates are produced from their aqueous solutions and/or suspensions by fluidized bed spray granulation in a hot fluidizing gas in the normal pressure range. Overheated steam is used as fluidizing gas and the granulate is evacuated from the granulator before it risks being damaged by heat exposure. If required, the storage-stable looseness and pourability of the partially dried substance is ensured by admixture of components capable of binding limited amounts of water and/or by a subsequent treatment. The system is a closed system in which a current of steam circulates, from which the water evaporated from the process substance is drawn as a partial current and to which the released thermal energy is supplied again. The process is free from exhaust fumes and contanimated waste waters, without diminishing the quality of the granulate produced on a large scale.

A process for the production, more particularly the 
continuous production, of pourable free-flowing granules of 

valuable materials or mixtures thereof, which are suitable 
as and/or for use in wetting agents, detergents and/or 

cleaning products from aqueous solutions and/or suspensions 
of such materials by fluidized-bed spray granulation in a 

hot fluidizing gas in the region of normal pressure,
 
characterized in that superheated steam is used as the 

fluidizing gas, the granules are discharged from the 
granulator before they can be damaged by heat and the long-term 

pourability and flowability of the material thus dried 
is optionally established by addition of mixture constituents 

capable of binding limited quantities of water and/or 
by an aftertreatment and in that the process is carried out 

in a closed-loop system comprising a steam circuit from 
which the water evaporated from the starting material is 

removed as a partial stream and the thermal energy released 
is returned. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
thermal energy is introduced into the superheated steam 

both through heat exchangers integrated in the fluidized 
bed and through external heat exchangers. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that, in the drying of useful materials particularly 

sensitive to heat or mixtures thereof, thermal energy is 
introduced into the superheated steam solely through 

external heat exchangers, the residence time in the external 
heat exchangers being shorter than in the case of heat 

exchangers integrated into the fluidized bed. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the steam removed from the steam circuit is 

freed from particles of the starting material entrained 
therein and put to other uses as recycle steam. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized  
 

in that at least part of the steam removed from the 
steam circuit is condensed and is reused together with the 

useful materials present therein, optionally after preliminary 
concentration, for preparing the aqueous solutions 

and/or suspensions to be dried. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the steam-filled system is operated under 

internal pressures in the region of normal pressure, but 
under such high pressures that air is unable to 

penetrate into the system, for example in damaged areas, 
internal system pressures below about 50 mbar excess 

pressure being preferred. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that auxiliaries are used for at least partly 

binding the residual water present in the incompletely 
dried product so that the long-term pourability and free 

flow of the dried material is guaranteed, the auxiliaries 
in question being at least partly incorporated in the 

aqueous solutions or suspensions before the fluidized-bed 
spray granulation process. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that 
components of the wetting agent, detergent or cleaning 

product, more particularly builders, washing alkalis and/or 
fillers, are used as the auxiliaries for binding the 

residual water. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the drying with superheated steam in the 

fluidized bed is terminated at residual water contents in 
the range from about 1 to 20% by weight and, more particularly, 

in the range from about 5 to 15% by weight and, 
at the same time, the content of free water not bound as 

water of crystallization is limited to values of at most 
about 10% by weight, based on the weight of the material 

discharged from the fluidized bed. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, the heat
