<ABSTRACT>
A fire alarm system exhibiting satisfactory reliability and 
being capable of easily and assuredly setting address and 

various discrimination values to terminal units (20), e.g. fire 
detectors, has a setting unit (1) including a first command unit 

(I1), a first discrimination unit (D1) for discriminating 
whether or not a transmitted set value transmitted by the first 

command unit (I1) and a set value received from a detector (20) 
coincide with each other, a second command unit (I2) for 

transmitting the set value to the detector when the received set 
value and the transmitted set value coincide with each other, 

and a second discrimination unit (D2) for discriminating whether 
or not the received set value and the set value transmitted from 

the first or the second command unit (I1, I2) coincide with each 
other, and further includes a fire detector (20) having a first 

response unit (R1) for transmitting, to the setting unit (1), a 
first response signal and the received set value when the output 

from the first command unit (I1) has been received, a second 
response unit (R2) for transmitting a second response signal and 

the received set value when the set value received by the first 
response unit (I1) coincide with each other, and a writing unit 

(W) for storing a result of discrimination in an EEPROM when the 
two set values received by the second response unit (R2) 

coincide with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fire alarm system to Which terminal units, such
as fire detectors, transmitters and relays, e.g. relays for supervising fire detectors and
transmitters or relays for controlling local sound units, fire block doors, smoke blocking
and exhausting units, and fire extinguishing units, is connected, according to the
preamble of the independent claims.A fire alarm system of this kind is disclosed in GB-A-2 203 577, for example.Hitherto, there has been known, designed and used a fire alarm
system, in which a multiplicity of terminal units, such as relays to which one or more
types of controlled units, such as fire detectors and transmitters or fire detectors, local
sound units and smoke blocking and exhausting units are connected, are disposed.
When each terminal unit is given individual address (self-address) or when various
discrimination values (for example, a threshold for discriminating a fire, a threshold
for discriminating a breakdown, a threshold for testing an erroneous alarm issue and
miss alarm issue, accumulation time, timer set time and the like) are set, so-called dip
switches are provided for the terminal units to perform the setting operation or the set
values are previously stored in a mask ROM or an EPROM in the manufacturing
process.Since the conventional fire alarm system uses the dip switches, the
mask ROM or the EPROM to set individual address for each terminal unit and a
variety of discrimination values, use of the dip switch enables the address or the like
to be changed easily at the spot at which the terminal unit is disposed after the
terminal unit has been disposed. However, there arises a problem in that the setting
operation performed by using hexadecimal notation is too complicated and an error
in setting to take place easily. What is worse, the set values can be changed by
tampering or the set values can be disordered easily due to vibrations or the like.Although use of the ROM or the EPROM enables the disorder of the set values 
due to vibrations to be prevented, the set values cannot be changed or an
ultraviolet-ray deletion unit is required to delete the stored contents. Although the
deletion operation can be performed in the manufacturing process, the contents
cannot be changed at the spot at which the terminal unit is disposed. What is even
worse, setting can be performed erroneously. If the address or the like is changed
after the terminal unit has been disposed, change to a new ROM or the like that has
a new address is required. Thus,
