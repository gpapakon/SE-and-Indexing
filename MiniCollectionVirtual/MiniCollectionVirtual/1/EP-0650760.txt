<ABSTRACT>
In a method of modernizing a heterogeneous exothermic 
synthesis reactor (1) of the type comprising an external 

shell (2), in which at least one catalytic bed (15, 16, 
17) is supported, the catalytic bed (15, 16, 17) is 

connected to an external boiler (21), for generating high 
pressure steam, by means of a reacted gas outlet nozzle 

(4) and a conduit (29) extending in said nozzle (4) 
thereby forming an annular airspace (30). Advantageously, 

the airspace (30) defines an outlet flowpath of the gases 
cooled in the boiler (21) which avoids overheating of the 

nozzle (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
From a general point of view, this invention
refers to a method of modernizing reactors for
effecting heterogeneous exothermic synthesis.More particularly, the invention refers to a
method of modernizing an ammonia or methanol
synthesis reactor of the type comprising an external
shell, in which at least one catalytic bed is
supported which is in fluid communication with a
nozzle extending below said shell, said nozzle being
provided with an opening for withdrawing the
reaction products leaving said at least one catalytic
bed.In the following description and in the claims,
the term: modernizing, indicates the modification of
a pre-existing reactor, with the aim of improving its
performance and obtaining, for example, a production
capacity and/or reaction efficiency comparable
to those of a newly-built reactor.In the terminology used in the field, this kind of
modernization is also referred to with the terms:
retrofitting or revamping.In the modernization of reactors for heterogeneous
synthesis, and in particular exothermic ones,
the need of recovering to a higher thermal level the
heat generated during the reaction while maintaining
as unaltered as possible the external structure
of the reactor, with particular regard to the shell,
the cover and the gas outlet nozzle of the reacted
gases, is more and more felt.A prevailing importance is acknowledgedly given
to the preservation of the external structure of
the reactor, since any modification of the latter
could render the desired modernization not only
economically unfeasible, but also potentially dangerous
owing to possible structural yieldings of the
reactor in the modified areas.The retrofitting methods according to the
known art, fundamentally propose the mere substitution
of the internals within the shell, in particular
of the pre-existing catalytic bed or beds, with
new radial or axial-radial high-yield beds.Although these modernization methods allow to
obtain, on the one hand, an increase of the reactor
production capacity and/or conversion yield while
maintaining the external structure thereof unaltered,
they fail on the other hand to attain a recovery at
an increased thermal level of the heat generated
during the synthesis reaction.In almost all cases, in fact, the reactor gas
outlet nozzle is not able to withstand the temperature
of the reaction gases leaving the lowermost
catalytic bed, up to the point that they must be
cooled before being discharged to the outside.The need of maintaining the external structure
of the synthesis reactor
