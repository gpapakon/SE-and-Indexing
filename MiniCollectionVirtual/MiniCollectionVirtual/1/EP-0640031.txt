 TITLESYSTEM FOR FEEDING AND MIXING MULÎ—-COMPONENTMOLDING COMPOSITIONS5 FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a system for supplying a plurality of different components in controlled amounts and component conditions to a molding machine. More particularly, the invention relates to a system for drying a plurality of different particulate molding composition components, 0 maintaining the state of dryness of the components throughout the system, blending the particulate components and mixing the components with a reinforcing component to obtain a uniform mixture of all components and feeding the mixture to a molding machine.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 5 Supplying a plurality of different components to a molding machine in precise amounts and in the desired condition has been a problem. This problem is aggravated in molding operations involving large parts which are being used in increasing numbers in automotive applications, and in particular in molding such parts which are reinforced with fiberglass. o The use of thermoplastic polymers which are recyclable is becoming more important in large part molding applications. Many of these polymers are subject to hydrolytic degradation at molding temperatures and must be delivered to a molding machine in a dry state.Fiberglass which is used to reinforce the molded parts is 5 delivered from the manufacturer in the form of chopped bundles. During handling, in particular mixing and feeding the fiberglass to a molding machine, the bundles tend to be broken apart foraiing "fuzzballs" which cause system pluggages and over-rich areas of fiberglass which detract from the molded article properties. The fine fibers from the bundle break up, o blocking air filters and transport lines.The system of the present invention permits combining multiple components in precise ratios while at the same time drying and maintaining the dryness of the ingredients throughout the proportioning, transport, mixing and feeding operations. Handling of the chopped fiberglass 5 is conducted in such a way as to keep fibrillation and "fuzz ball" formation of the fiberglass to a minimum. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe system of the present invention comprises a plurality of holding bins for the particulate molding material components. Each component requires its appropriate drying condition. Separate dryer hoppers are provided for each component. Each hopper has its own heater control which adjusts the temperature of the conditioned air, i.e., dehumidified air, prior to its entry into the
