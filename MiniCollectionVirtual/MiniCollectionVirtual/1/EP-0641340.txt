<DESCRIPTION>
 NEW 3-(SUBSTITUTED TETRAZOLYL)-4-OXO-4H-PYRIDO- [1,2-a]PYRIMIDINES, SALTS THEREOF, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAMEThis invention relates to therapeutically useful novel 3-(l-substituted-lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]- pyrimidines and/or 3-(2-substituted-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-4-oxo- 4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidines, salts thereof, process for their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions contain¬ ing them. These new compounds may be therapeutically useful first of all as gastroprotectives in the treatment and pre- vention of ulcer.It is known that some representatives of the 4H-pyrido- [l,2-a]pyrimidine-4-ones exert significant antiallergic and ulcus preventing activity (EP-PS No. 217 673 and 218 423, BE-PS No. 873 197 and 873 194 and US-PS No. 4 122 274 and 4 457 932) . Cyctoprotective activity of the 9-methyl-3- tetrazolyl-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidine potassium salt was shown more in detail (Gastroenterology 1985 88./ 1354).The invention is based upon the unexpected discovery that substitution of the acidic hydrogen atom of the tetra- zolyl group of the 3-tetrazolyl-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyri- midines results in derivatives with broader therapeutic spectrum.More particularly the invention relates to novel 4-oxo- 4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidines with general formulaA 4779-77 KY 

 and/or
 whereinR means C^-galkyl, C3_.6alkenyl, C3_6alkynyl, 03-7 cyclo- alkyl, Cι_4alkoxycarbonyl group or C-j__.s aralkyl group, optionally substituted by one or more halogen atom(s) , or by nitro-group, R1 stands for hydrogen atom or a ^-_\ alkyl group.As used herein: the term C^_4alkyl means straight or branched chain aliphatic saturated hydrocarbyl groups (such as the methyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert.-butyl, neopentyl group).Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) mean salts formed with alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, or acid addition salts formed with organic or inorganic acids.According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the new compounds of the general formulae (I) and (II) , wherein R and R1 are the same as defined above, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which c o m p r i s e s reacting a 3-tetrazolyl-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimi- dine of general formula
