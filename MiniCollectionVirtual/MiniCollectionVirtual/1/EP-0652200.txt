<ABSTRACT>
A process for the generation of diisopropyl ether from a crude 
by-product acetone stream comprises the steps of: 


a) hydrogenating a crude acetone stream over a 
bulk-metal, nickel-rich catalyst to give an 

isopropanol-rich intermediate, and 
b) dehydrating said isopropanol-rich intermediate in 
the presence of strong acid zeolite catalyst to 

yield diisopropyl ether. 
 
Preferably, the strong acid zeolite catalyst used in the 
second step is selected from the group consisting of 

β-zeolite, optionally modified with one or more metals from 
Group IB, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodic Table, and 

a dealuminised Y-zeolite. The disclosed method may also be 
used for the co-generation of diisopropyl ether with methyl 

t-butyl ether if the crude acetone stream contains, in 
addition, significant quantities of methanol and t-butanol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a novel two-step procedure 
for generation of diisopropyl ether (DIPE), and also for co-generation 
of DIPE and methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), from a 
crude by-product acetone stream which comprises the steps of: 
(1) hydrogenating the crude acetone stream over a bulk-metal 
nickel-rich catalyst to give an isopropanol-rich effluent; and 
(2) subjecting the isopropanol-rich intermediate to 
dehydration conditions in the presence of strong acid zeolite 
catalyst, preferably from the group consisting of a β-zeolite, 
dealuminised Y-zeolite and metal-modified β-zeolites, to yield 
DIPE or a mixture of DIPE and MTBE, depending on the 
composition of the crude acetone stream. It is known to those skilled in the art that ethers, 
including both symmetrical and unsymmetrical ethers, may be 
prepared by reacting an alcohol with another alcohol to form 
the desired product. The reaction mixture, containing 
catalyst and/or condensing agent may be separated and further 
treated to permit attainment of the desired product. Such 
further treatment commonly includes one or more distillation 
operations. Methyl tert-butyl ether is finding increasing use as a 
blending component in high octane gasoline as the current 
gasoline additives based on lead and manganese are phased out. 
Currently all commercial processes for the manufacture of 
methyl tert-butyl ether are based upon the liquid-phase 
reaction of isobutylene and methanol (Eq. 1), catalyzed by a 
cationic ion-exchange resin (see, for example: Hydrocarbon 
Processing, Oct. 1984, p. 63; Oil and Gas J., Jan. 1, 1979, 
p. 76; Chem. Economics Handbook-SRI, Sept. 1986, p. 543-7051P). 
The cationic ion-exchange resins used in MTBE 
synthesis normally have the sulphonic acid functionality (see: 
J. Tejero, J. Mol. Catal., 42 (1987) 257; C. Subramamam 
et al., Can. J. Chem. Eng., 65 (1987) 613).  
 
With the expanding use of MTBE as an acceptable gasoline 
additive, a growing problem is the availability of raw 
materials. Historically, the critical raw material is 
isobutylene (Oil and Gas J., June 8, 1987, p. 55). It would 
be advantageous, therefore, to have a process to make MTBE 
that does not require isobutylene as a building block. DIPE may be used in addition to MTBE as an octane 
enhancer in gasoline. Japanese Patent Application No. 82-07432 teaches the use 
of zeolites, particularly mordenites and faujasites, to make 
dialkyl ethers containing primary or secondary alkyl groups 
by the liquid phase dehydration of alcohols. U.S.
