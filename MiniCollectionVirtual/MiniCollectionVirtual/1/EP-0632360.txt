<ABSTRACT>
A method for dynamically varying the power consumption of computer circuits (20) 
under program control. A power control subsystem (22) determines the minimum required 

level of power (52;Fig. 2) based on a number of factors (Fig. 3) including the particular 
operation and the recent amount of idle time of the circuit. Voltage (42) and clock speed (38) 

are determined for the circuit (20) to provide the minimum level of power. The system (22) for 
controlling the power consumption of the computer circuit (20) comprises a power control 

subsystem (22) for determining the power level (24), a sequencer (26) for controlling the 
change in voltage and clock speed, a variable voltage source (40), and a variable clock source 

(36).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the reduction of power consumption in computers. 
More specifically, the invention relates to techniques for reducing the power consumption in 
computers by dynamically varying the voltage and frequency of computer systems under 
program control. In computer systems, and especially in portable computer systems, power 
consumption is an important consideration. Conservation of power extends the period of time 
that portable computing devices are able to operate effectively from an internal battery when 
the computer is disconnected from an external power source. Among users of the portable 
computers there is a need for the same or more computational capability as found in desktop 
machines placed in a low-power environment. Power dissipation in "well-designed" CMOS circuits is dominated by the switching 
component, which may be approximated by the formula

P = f*C*Vdd², 


 
where f is the clock frequency, C is the average effective capacitance being switched at each 
clock cycle, and Vdd is the supply voltage. Thus, the task of reducing power needs becomes that 
of minimizing f , C, and Vdd, while retaining the required functionality. Since the maximum 
frequency decreases in roughly linear proportion to Vdd, it can be approximated it by the 
formula

f = k*Vdd, 


 
where k is a constant factor. Thus, lowering the voltage from 5 volts to 2 volts, by a factor of 
2.5, offers a possible fifteen fold reduction in power (2.5*5²/2²) while similarly slowing the 
maximum operating frequency of the computer by only a factor of about two and a half. Many 
integrated circuit (IC) manufacturers sell chips that operate over a range of supply voltages. In 
some cases, chips have simply been recharacterized, and work unchanged for different voltage 
modes. Some systems achieve a reduction in power consumption by running at a constant 
lower voltage However, running at a continuously lowered voltage can result in poorer 
performance, which may be unacceptable to the user. Other low power computer systems vary their clock rate to conserve power. Varying 
the clock rate alone gives a linear decrease in power usage. For static ICs that can actually stop 
their clock altogether when they are not busy, however, there is little advantage in slowing the 
clock over simply running the clock as fast as possible when there is work, and stopping it 
completely when there is no work. US-A-5,167,024 describes a power management method for a portable computer 
which controls various units within
