<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for the neutralization of amine or alkanolamine heat stable salts with aqueous KOH or with alkali metal base, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate, formulated with amines or alkanolamines, resulting in less solids formation than commonly formed when alkali metal bases, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or aqueous potassium carbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is to a process for neutralization of amine or
alkanolamine heat stable salts formed when an amine solution is used in gas conditioning.The formation of heat stable amine salts (HSAS) in amine solutions used in
gas conditioning applications has long been a problem, particularly in refinery systems or
when oxygen or carbon monoxide is present in the feed gas to the amine unit.HSAS are called heat stable since they are not regenerable in the amine
unit's stripping section, as are hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbonate/bicarbonate/carbamate
(CO2) salts. These HSAS, such as amine salts of formate, acetate, glycolate, glyoxalate,
oxalate, thiocyanate, thiosulfate, sulfate, sulfite and chloride, decrease the acid gas carrying
capacity of the amine and increase solution viscosity, thus increasing amine unit operating
costs.Several methods are reported to reduce HSAS in amine solutions, though the
costs are very expensive and each method has practical limitations. Anion exchange is a
method of removing HSAS to low levels (i.e. below 500ppm). If cations such as iron and
sodium need to be removed, then a cation anion exchange resin is also required. One
disadvantage of ion exchange is the high amount of water wash required to regenerate the
resin beds. In addition, ion exchange resins do not generally remove organic impurities such
as hydrocarbons and triethylene glycol commonly found in amine solutions. Distillation and
vacuum distillation can remove organic impurities such as triethylene glycol and
hydrocarbons but the process is energy intensive since the amine and water both are carried
overhead in the purification process. If HSAS are present, the amine solution must also be
neutralized with strong base to prevent acids, especially formic acid and acetic acid, from
going overhead into the purified amine solution.EP-A 0 286 143 describes the removal of heat-stable alkanolamine salts from
alkanolamine solutions by passing the aqueous solution through an
electrodialysis cell. The contaminated alkanolamine solution is treated with a
base, preferably an inorganic base such as Na2CO3, NaOH or KOH. However,
electrodialysis with an ion exchange membrane is an additional step that is
time-consuming and requires additional expenses. To extend the time before having to reclaim or discard an amine solution,
aqueous sodium hydroxide (caustic) or aqueous potassium carbonate are extensively used
in the gas treating industry to neutralize HSAS. These bases, being stronger bases than
amines generally used
