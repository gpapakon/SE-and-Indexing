<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (3) and a method for automatically cleaning rollers, and in particular impression cylinders (1) provided with blankets (2), or counter-pressure cylinders. The apparatus (3) includes a reeling-off roller (6) and a reeling-on roller (7). The roller (6) carries a cleaning web (9) which extends from the roller (6) over a pressure pad (11) attached to a holder (14) and from there to the reeling-on roller (7), optionally via one or more guide rolls (10). Positioned between the reeling-off roller (6) and the pressure pad (11) is a spray device (12) which delivers cleaning agent (13) to the web. The holder (14) is attached to a compressed-air piston (15) which is able to move the holder (14) backwards and forwards, towards and away from the impression cylinder (1). During this reciprocating movement, the cleaning web (9) is moved progressively from the reeling-on roller (6), over the pressure pad (11) and to the reeling-on roller (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and to a 
method for automatically cleaning rollers, particularly 
blanket cylinders and counter-pressure cylinders in 
printing machines. In a conventional printing press, the paper web to be 
printed is taken from a feed roller and passed through 
the actual printing press, which comprises one or more 
printing or impression cylinders, where the paper to be 
printed is printed on one or both sides thereof and 
which paper, when printing is completed, passes over one 
or more guide rollers to a folding device, where the 
printed paper web is cut and folded. The blanket cylinders 
are normally clothed with a rubber material or some 
other polymeric material. The two long sides of the 
blanket material are normally secured in a groove which 
extends in the longitudinal direction of respective 
impression cylinders. The printed paper deposits ink and paper fibres (lint) 
on the blanket, successively as printing continues. 
These ink and paper-fibre deposits must be removed from 
the blanket at regular intervals in order a) to prevent 
pleating or wrinkling of the paper web, b) to prevent 
the deposits from transferring to the paper web, and c) 
to prevent faulty web-registration or alignment of the 
web with the impression cylinders, and impaired quality 
of the print produced. When cleaning such blankets, it 
is necessary to take into account the fact that the 
longitudinal attachment groove extends along the cylindrical 
surface of the blanket. Many different methods of 
cleaning impression cylinders manually are known to the  
 
art. For instance, the deposits can be removed by scraping 
clean the press cylinders, subsequent to having 
removed the paper web, either with or without the addition 
of a cleaning agent. This cleaning method is laborious, 
slow and highly expensive. The object of the present invention is to provide an 
apparatus and a method for cleaning the blankets of 
impression cylinders which will avoid the aforesaid 
problems and which will enable blanket cylinders to be 
cleaned several times more quickly, more positively and 
more effectively than can be achieved with hitherto 
known manually-operated apparatus and methods. The invention will now be described in more detail with 
reference to non-limiting and solely exemplifying embodiments 
thereof, and with reference to Figures 1-19 of 
the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 illustrates schematically and in perspective an 
impression cylinder 1 fitted with a blanket 2 and provided 
with a
