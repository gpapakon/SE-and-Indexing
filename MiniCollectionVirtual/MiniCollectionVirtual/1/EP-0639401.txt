<ABSTRACT>
A method for effecting the initiation of a molecular process or reaction in a 
substance, which comprises bringing the substance into contact with a surface 

of a cold cathode device and applying an electric potential across the cold 
cathode device to cause electrons to be emitted from the surface thereof with 

an energy level sufficient to effect the initiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for effecting the initiation of
molecular processes in substances present on the surface of the apparatus.The initiation or catalysis of molecular processes or reactions can be conducted
by a variety of means and many ways of effecting them are known.The present invention is concerned with the provision of a novel means of
effecting the initiation and/or catalysis of molecular processes by means of the
bombardment of molecules by electrons emitted from a particular type of
source, which means it allows for good control of the energy of the electrons
during the bombardment.In accordance with the invention, there is provided a method for effecting the
initiation of a molecular process or reaction in a substance, which comprises
bringing the substance into contact with a surface of a cold cathode device and
applying an electric potential across the cold cathode device to cause electrons
to be emitted from the surface thereof with an energy level sufficient to effect
the initiation.The term "cold cathode" is well known in the electronics art and can be simply
defined as a device incorporating an electrode from which electron emission is
caused by a high potential gradient across the cold cathode device at normal
temperatures, for example, those less than 100Â°C and commonly ambient
temperatures.Examples of cold cathodes are:
i) "Tip emitters" - which are generally made from a number of silicon or
tungsten cones.ii) "Back-biassed junction cold cathodes" - in which electrons are accelerated
across a p-n junction near its surface and emitted into vacuum allowing
high electron emission densities. iii) "metal-insulator-metal (MIM) devices" - in which a thin sandwich of an
insulating material layer is prepared between two metal layers of the same
or different metals.Cold cathodes generally, and in particular each of the above types of cold
cathode device can be operated through the application of, and control of, a
voltage across the devices. Control of the voltage is critical to ensure that
electrons emitted from the device have the correct level of kinetic energy in
particular to effect initiation of the desired molecular process in the substance in
contact with the device.Although each of the above types of cold cathode may be employed in the
method of the invention, it has been found that MIM cold cathode devices in
particular can be used to good effect.As stated above, such MIM devices comprise a metal-insulator-metal sandwich
in which each metal layer may be
