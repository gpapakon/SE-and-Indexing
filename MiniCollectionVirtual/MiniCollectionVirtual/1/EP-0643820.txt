<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a plate heat exchanger for heat transfer between two fluids having different large flow, comprising several principally rectangular heat transfer plates (2a) provided with inlet and outlet openings (5a, 6a and 7a, 8a) through its corner portion (9a, 10a, 11a, 12a). Each heat transfer plate (2a) has a central heat transfer portion (17a) and two distribution portions (15a, 16a) located between the heat transfer portion (17a) and respective inlet and outlet openings (5a, 6a and 7a, 8a). According to the invention the sizes of the inlet and outlet openings (5a, 6a) differ for one of said two fluids from the size of the inlet and outlet openings (7a, 8a) for the other fluid. In addition the distribution portions (15a, 16a) of the heat transfer plates provide a larger flow resistance for said one fluid than for the other fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plate heat exchanger for 
heat transfer between two fluids having different volume flow rates, 
comprising several principally rectangular heat transfer 
plates, each having inlet and outlet openings for respective 
fluids through its corner portions, a heat transfer portion, 
located centrally between respective inlet and outlet 
openings, and two distribution portions, located between the 
heat transfer portion and respective inlet and outlet 
openings, and being formed for distribution of the respective 
two fluids, when they flow from their inlet openings towards 
the heat transfer portions. Traditionally formed plate heat exchangers usually have a 
package of identical heat transfer plates, which have inlet 
and outlet openings of the same kind for both of the fluids. 
Such a heat exchanger, having inlet and outlet openings of 
the same kind, is optimally used only with equal flow of both 
of the fluids. If one of the fluids has a smaller flow 
through the heat exchanger than the other fluid, the pressure 
drops of the fluids will be different, because the pressure 
drops varies proportionally with the square of the volume 
flow. This means, that the heat transfer between the fluids 
and the heat transfer plates cannot be optimal on both 
sides of each heat transfer plate, if the flows of the fluids 
differ. To increase the heat transfer, in connection with a so-called 
asymmetrical flow between the heat exchanging fluids, it has 
previously been proposed to decrease the volume of the flow 
ducts on one side of the heat transfer plates, as disclosed 
in EP 470 073, or to influence the flow resistance of the 
flow ducts by a combination of different corrugation patterns 
of the heat transfer plates, as disclosed in EF 88 316 or EP 
204 880. These previously proposed arrangements 
only admit a small asymmetrical flow between  
 
the two fluids and the heat transfer regarding the heat 
transfer plates is not sufficiently effective for 
both fluids. An object of the present invention is to achieve an improved 
heat transfer between two fluids having different volume flow rates 
in a plate heat exchanger. An 
additional object is to provide a plate heat exchanger, which 
admits a larger asymmetrical flow between the two fluids, 
compared to previously known plate heat 
exchangers. According to the invention a plate heat exchanger as initially described 
is characterised in that the size of the inlet and 
outlet openings of the heat transfer plates for a first of 
said

principally rectangular heat transfer plates (2a, 20), each
