<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for dissolving a gas into and mixing the same with a liquid is provided for mixing bubbles with and dispersing the same into a liquid and/or for dissolving a gas into a liquid efficiently. The apparatus comprises a throttled section (12) formed in a fluid flow passage, a gas inlet (18) provided slightly downstream of the throttled section (12), a widened section (16) continuous to the throttled section (12), a mixing section (20) provided downstream of the widened section (16), for mixing the gas introduced from the gas inlet (18) with the liquid in the fluid flow passage, and a nozzle section (24) provided on the outlet of the mixing section (20). The method is achieved by using this apparatus. The method and the apparatus are applicable to methods and apparatuses for dissolving ozone into a liquid, for dispersing bubbles in a liquid and floating small particles in the liquid, and the like methods and apparatuses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an
apparatus for disperse-mixing gas bubbles with a liquid
and dissolving a gas into a liquid efficiently.Conventionally, a so-called ejector type bubble
generator has been used as an apparatus for disperse-mixing
a great amount of a gas with a liquid. With this
bubble generator, liquid jet sprayed out from a nozzle
hole or nozzle holes is made to pass through a gas to
be mixed with the liquid, and the gas around the liquid
jet is drawn in it. Then, gas mixture is jetted out
into the liquid from a throttle or throttles having
substantially the same diameter as that of the nozzle
hole or the nozzle holes and provided coaxially
therewith. In this way, a liquid is mixed with fine
bubbles.In some apparatuses, the fine bubble-dispersed jet
produced by the above-mentioned processes is supplied
to the lower portion of a tank in which the bubbles are
dispersed as they are rising. A great amount of gas is
dissolved in the liquid while the fine bubbles are
rising in the liquid in the tank, thereby producing a
liquid into which a required gas is dissolved. In some other apparatuses, a liquid and a gas are
supplied to a pressure pump and are pressurized thereby
to dissolve the gas into the liquid. Thereafter, the
pressure on the gas-dissolved liquid is reduced so as
to precipitate the gas dissolved in the liquid, thereby
forming bubbles in the liquid.When the conventional ejector type bubble
generator is used, the liquid jet nozzle holes and
throttles must be aligned with each other, leading to a
complicated structure of the apparatus and requiring
difficult assembling processes. The liquid-dissolving
apparatus using a bubble tank requires a long starting
time for obtaining a liquid into which a gas begins to
be fully dissolved and provides poor manufacturing
efficiency.In the conventional apparatus using a pressure
pump, a gas and a liquid are supplied together to the
pressure pump. This is likely to produce cavitation in
the pressure pump. In order to prevent the cavitation,
the material and the structure of the pressure pump are
limited. Upon producing bubbles under the pressure
dissolving process, only a gas dissolved in the liquid
under pressure is precipitated, and thus it is
impossible with the pressure reducing process to
precipitate more amount of gas than that dissolved in
the liquid. Accordingly, a very high pressure is
required in order to produce a great amount of bubbles. 
very easily.This invention has been made in order to overcome
the problems which the prior art
