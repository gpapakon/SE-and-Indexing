<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
prostaglandin (hereinafter abbreviated as PG) 
derivatives. PG exhibits a variety of important 
physiological activities in a trace amount. For its 
diversity, natural PG analogues and a vast number of 
derivatives thereof have been studied on synthesis and 
biological activities, with attempts to apply these 
compounds to pharmaceuticals. These studies are 
reported in many publications and Japanese Patent 
Application KOKAI No. 52-100446, Japanese Patent 
Application KOHYO No. 2-502009 (WO 89/00559), etc. The compounds of the present invention are 
broadly covered by Formula I described in Japanese 
Patent Application KOHYO No. 2-502009 supra but there 
is no specific description on these compounds in the 
specification. An object of the present invention is to 
provide compounds which possess much more potent 
pharmacological activities than PG derivatives known so 
far.  As a result of extensive studies, the present 
inventors have found that some particular compounds 
exhibit extremely excellent activities for improving 
renal diseases, ischemic heart diseases and heart 
failure, though these compounds broadly fall within 
Formula I but are not concretely described in the 
specification supra. The present invention has thus 
been attained. That is, the present invention relates to PG 
derivatives represented by formula: 
wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group 
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and salts thereof. In the present invention, the alkyl group is 
used to mean a straight or branched alkyl group. The compounds of the present invention shown 
by formula (I) can be prepared by, e.g., the following 
processes.  wherein R¹ has the same significance as R, except for a 
hydrogen atom; TBS represents a t-butyldimethylsiloxy 
group; and EE represents an ethoxyethyl group. That is, the compound of formula (II) is 
reacted with the compound of formula (III) to introduce 
the ω-side chain of PG and thus obtain the compound of 
formula (IV). On the other hand, (Z)-1-iodo-3-(1-ethoxyethyloxy)-1-propene 
is reacted with t-butyl 
lithium and lithium 2-thienylcyanocuprate. The 
resulting product is reacted with the compound of 
formula (IV) obtained above, whereby the α-side chain 
of PG is introduced to give the compound of formula 
(V). The compound of formula (V) is then reduced 
stereo-selectively with lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride 
to obtain the compound of formula 
(VI). Thereafter the ethoxyethyl protective group is 
removed to give the compound
