<ABSTRACT>
A method for the re-treatment of residue generated in the 
course of removing fluorine from waste water. 
The method comprises the step of: drying the residues 
consisting of rare earth fluorides, which are generated in the 

course of treating the waste water with a rare earth compound 
to remove fluorine ions from the waste water; mingling the 

rare earth fluorides with a sodium hydroxide solid; heat 
treating the rare earth fluorides at temperatures ranging from 

approximately 320 to approximately 450 °C for times ranging 
from approximately 0.5 to approximately 5 hours; and applying 

wash and dry to the heat-treated resultant, in due order. 
The invention pertains to the reuse of rare earth 
elements used in the treatment of fluorine. Products obtained 

by carrying out the method contain rare earth hydroxides, 
which are useful as materials for glass abrasive or for 

treating fluorine, catalysts, and other materials for the 
fields of using a variety of rare earth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a treatment 
method for reusing fluorine-treated residue and, more 
particularly, to a method for re-treating with rare-earth 
compounds residue which is generated in the course of removing 
dissolved fluorine ions from waste water, so as to reuse the 
residue. In the natural world, there exists a trace amount of 
fluorine by nature, for instance, about 1.2 to 1.4 ppm in the 
marine water. This trace amount of fluorine does not cause 
any problems in view of ecological environment. Now, the use 
of fluorine or fluorine-containing compounds, however, is 
extensively increased as various industries, such as 
electromagnetic, metallic, chemical or ceramic industries, 
have been rapidly developed. For example, fluorine or 
fluorine-containing compounds are used for manufacturing 
semiconductors, washing the interior of a cathode ray tube, 
manufacturing aluminum, and etc. Waste water released from a plant pertaining to the 
industries contains fluorine which is in a free radical state 
or combined state with other elements or compounds, and the  
 
concentration of fluorine in the waste water often comes to 
several hundreds ppm, which is very dangerous in view of 
ecology, affecting human bodies, animals or plants 
detrimentally. Accordingly, it is required to lower the 
concentration of the fluorides in the waste water. In an effort to lower the concentration of fluorine in 
the waste water, there has been proposed such a method for 
treating the fluorine-containing waste water that at least one 
species selected from a calcium compound, e.g. Ca(OH)₂, an 
aluminum compound, e.g. Al₂(SO₄)₃ and a phosphoric acid 
compound is added to the waste water, so as to insolubilize 
the fluorine ions, and the resulting supernatant and sludge is 
separated from each other. However, the above conventional method is problematic in 
that a good deal of chemical reagents are needed, generating 
a great amount of sludge. Even though this generated sludge 
is buried, fluorides are eluted therefrom, so that a plenty of 
alkaline chemical reagents necessary to neutralize the 
fluorides are demanded. What is still worse, this 
conventional method is not so effective to the removal of the 
fluorine. In order to solve the problems, rare earth compounds have 
recently been used as fluorine-removing agents, in lieu of 
calcium oxide (ca(OH)₂) or aluminum sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃). Rare 
earth elements along with fluorine form rare-earth fluorides,  
 
very stable compounds. Since these
