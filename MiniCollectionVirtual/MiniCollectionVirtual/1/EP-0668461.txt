<ABSTRACT>
The two seal parts (4, 6) are joined by a circular, thin connecting arm (7) extending in a radially direction. The difference between the axial breadth of the groove (5) and the axial extension of the second seal part (6), near where they radially overlap, is at least as much as the piston's (1) deflection. The second seal part has end surfaces on both sides in an axial direction in the form of thrust surfaces (8, 9) resting on the axial surfaces (10, 11) of the groove. The first seal part and the groove's base (12) are joined by a force fit.

A sealing arrangement for a reciprocating piston (1)
which is enclosed circumferentially by a housing (2),

comprising a seal (3) of polymer material with a statistically
sealing first sealing part (4), which is fixed in a groove (5)

in the housing (2), the said groove being open in the
direction of the piston, and a second sealing part (6) which -

viewed in the radial direction - is arranged at least
partially inside the groove (5) and surrounds the piston (1)

in a sealing manner with radial prestress, the first (4) and
the second sealing part (6) being connected to one another by

means of a connecting web (7) which extends essentially in the
radial direction, is of circular design and is configured to

be thin in the manner of a rolling bellows, and the difference
between the axial width of the groove (5) and the axial extent

of the second sealing part (6) in the region of their radial
overlap being at least as great as the deflection movement of

the piston (1) occurring during the intended use, and the
second sealing part being provided with stop faces (8, 9) on

both sides in the axial direction, characterised in that the
stop faces (8, 9) of the second sealing part (6) have a

surface profile (13).
A sealing arrangement according to claim 1,
characterised in that the second sealing part (6) has end

faces on both sides in the axial direction, which form the
stop faces (8, 9), and in that the stop faces (8, 9) can only

be placed against the axial boundary surfaces (10, 11) of the
groove (5) under extreme deflections of the piston (1) and

only in that case does the second sealing part (6) surround
the piston (1) in a sealing manner and so as to be relatively

displaceable.
A sealing arrangement according to either of claims
1 and 2, characterised in that the difference between the

axial width of the groove (5) and the axial extent of the
second sealing part (6) is 0.05 to 0.3 times greater than the 

deflection movement of the piston (1).
A sealing arrangement according to any of claims 1

to 3, characterised in that the first and second sealing parts
(4, 6) merge integrally without any abrupt change in direction

into the respectively adjacent connecting web (7).
A sealing arrangement according to any of claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the first and second sealing parts

(4, 6) and the connecting web (7) are made of the same
material.
A sealing arrangement according to any of claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the first sealing part (4) and the

base (12) of the groove (5) are connected to one another by
means of a press fit.
A sealing arrangement according to any of claims 1
to 6, characterised in that the second sealing part (6) is

provided with at least two sealing lips (14, 15), arranged
adjacent to one another with axial spacing, on the side facing

the piston (1) on the inside circumference.
The use of a sealing arrangement according to any
of claims 1 to 7 for sealing the piston in a hammer drill.
