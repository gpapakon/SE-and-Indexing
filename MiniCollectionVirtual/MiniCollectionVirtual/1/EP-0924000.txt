<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method for in-situ cleaning of a soil fraction contaminated with
halogenated products, in particular with chlorinated products. This method comprises at

least the step of introducing an electron donor under substantially anaerobic conditions
into the relevant soil fraction. The electron donor herein comprises compost and/or

derivatives thereof. In preference the electron donor originates substantially from the
first filtrate fraction of compost. This first filtrate fraction comprises liquid released

during the first 96 hours after composting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for in-situ cleaning of a soil fraction
contaminated with halogenated products, particularly chlorinated products, at least
comprising the step of introducing an electron donor under substantially anaerobic
conditions in the relevant soil fraction.The cleaning of soil fractions contaminated with inter alia chlorinated products such as
for instance tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene is no simple matter. In the past this
cleaning was mainly carried out ex-situ, wherein water was pumped through the
contaminated soil fraction to dissolve the chlorinated products, whereafter the water
with the chlorine products dissolved therein was cleaned above ground. It will be
apparent that such a method is not only time-consuming but also costly.Another method, wherein the cleaning of the soil fraction takes place in-situ, comprises
a two-step reaction in which anaerobic and aerobic operations are performed
alternately. During the first step of this two-step reaction, possibly present tetra- and
trichloroethene is converted anaerobically into cis-1,2-dichloroethene, while in the
second step this latter is converted aerobically into carbonic acid, water and chloride. A
drawback of this method is that it must be carried out in two steps, wherein different
and incompatible conditions - i.e. anaerobic and aerobic - must be brought about for the
growth of the micro-organisms involved in this process. There is moreover the danger
that during the first step a significant quantity of carcinogenic vinyl chloride can be
formed.As an example of a publication in which the above stated two-step reaction is described
can be mentioned the European patent with publication number EP-B-0 569 199. In this
publication is described an in-situ method for the biological decomposition of
halogenated organic compounds in aqueous soil fractions, wherein under the influence
of anaerobic conditions an electron donor is supplied to the soil fraction in order to 
stimulate the dehalogenating bacteria acting under anaerobic conditions and wherein
the biological formation of lower halogenated compounds is limited by maintaining a
sulphate-reducing environment in the fraction with biological activity. When the greater
part of the lower halogenated compounds has been removed, the anaerobic conditions
are transformed into aerobic conditions by adding oxygen so that the bacteria acting
under aerobic conditions are activated. The biological decomposition of halogenated
organic compounds is continued using these
