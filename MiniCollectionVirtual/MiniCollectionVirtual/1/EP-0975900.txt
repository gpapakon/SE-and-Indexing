<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a power supply chain (1) for guiding cables, flexible tubes and the like between two connection points, comprising several chain links connected and detached by upper and lower crossbars. Said links are assembled in two parallel strands, overlap each other and can be inclined. In each chain strand, the chain links (2) alternate in the form of inner links (3) having inner overlap areas (5) and outer links (4) having outer overlap areas (5). Inclination of the chain links (2) in relation to each other is limited by stops (8, 9, 12, 13) which are arranged in the overlap areas. The curvature of the chain (1) is defined by the arrangement of the stops (8, 9, 12, 13). By arranging the symmetrically disposed stops (8, 9, 12, 13) in an unsymmetrical position in relation to the central axis running in the longitudinal direction of the chain (S2), two different curvatures of the power supply chain (1) can be obtained using the same inner and outer links (3, 4) depending on the orientation of the links (3, 4) in relation to the longitudinal direction of the chain.

Energy guiding chain (1) for guiding hoses, cables and
the like between two connection points relatively

movable with respect to each other, said chain
comprising a substantially straight lower strand

followed by a curved section and a self-supporting
upper strand, with several chain straps (2) which are

connected to one another via upper and lower crossmembers
in detachable fashion and assembled into two

parallel strands, and which overlap one another and can
be angled around axes of rotation, where chain straps

(2) designed as inner straps (3) with inner overlap
areas and as outer straps (4) with outer overlap areas

alternate with one another in each chain strand, and
where the inner and outer straps (3, 4) are

respectively opposite to one another in the parallel
chain strands, and where stops each comprising first

stop surfaces (9) and (13), respectively, for
restricting the bending of the curved section and

second stop surfaces (8,12) for restricting the bending
of the self-supporting section of the upper strand are

provided in the overlap areas (5) of adjacent chain
strands, and where the stop surfaces (8, 9) of the

inner straps (3) are positioned asymmetrically with
respect to mirroring at the centre plane (S
2
),
containing the axes of rotation, 
characterised in that

the stop surfaces (12,13) of the outer straps (4) are
positioned asymmetrically with respect to mirroring at

the centre plane (S
2
) such that in case of a change of
the orientation of 180° either of the inner straps (3) 

or of the outer straps (4) around the centre axis (S
3
)
running in the middle between the two axes of rotation

and parallely thereto the self-supporting section of
the upper strand and/or the curved section of the chain

obtains a different curvature.
Energy guiding chain according to claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the stop surfaces (8, 9;
12, 13) of the inner straps (3) and the outer straps

(4) are positioned asymmetrically with respect to the
centre plane (S
2
) in such a way that after changing the
orientation either of the inner straps (3) or of the

outer straps (4) about the centre axis (S
3
) by an angle
of 180° the curved section receives a slightly

different curvature.
Energy guiding chain according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 the stop surfaces
(8, 9; 12, 13) are positioned mirror-symmetrically with

respect to the centre axis (S
1
) of the chain straps (2)
running perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of

the chain.
Energy guiding chain according to one of the claims 1
to 3, 
characterised in that
 the chain
straps provided for a change of their orientation by an

angle of 180° are the outer straps.
Energy guiding chain according to claim 4, 
characterised
in that
 the first stop surfaces
(13) of the outer straps (4) are positioned parallel

and the second stop surfaces (12) of the outer straps
(4) are positioned slightly inclined with respect to

the centre plane (S
2
) containing the axes of rotation.
Energy guiding chain according to one of the claims 5 
to 6, 
characterised in that
 the
chain straps (2) on the outer sides of the chain

strands are provided with at least one marking (16,17)
in order to determine the orientation of the chain

straps (2) with respect to the centre plane (S
2
)
containing the axes of rotation.
Energy guiding chain according to one of the claims 1
to 6, 
characterised in that
 double
acting stops each comprising two stop surfaces (8,9)

and (12, 13), respectively, are provided for
restricting the angling of the curved section as well

as the self-supporting upper strand of the chain.
