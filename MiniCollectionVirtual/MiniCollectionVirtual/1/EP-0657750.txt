<ABSTRACT>
Induction logging around a well borehole is 
effected by generating first and second electrical signals 

correlative to the formation conductivity at first and 
second radial distances from the borehole, and then 

generating an electrical induction signal by (i) altering 
the first electrical signal by a first factor correlative to 

the specified distance to produce a first altered electrical 
signal; (ii) altering the second electrical signal by a 

second factor correlative to the specified distance to 
produce a second altered electrical signal; and (iii) 

summing the first altered electrical signal with the second 
altered electrical signal to produce the electrical 

induction signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to induction logging. An induction log involves the use of coils which 
are mounted at specified locations on a sonde and which form 
current flows in formations adjacent to a well borehole. 
Induction logs are often made to investigate a particular 
radial distance extending outwardly from the well borehole. 
One set of coils is constructed for what is normally denoted 
as the medium depth investigation and the other set is for 
the deep radial investigation. Normally, the medium and 
deep distances are fixed as a matter of design relating to 
the deployment of the coils on the sonde. Many logs are 
evaluated on the basis of the data obtained from the medium 
and deep induction logs. Sometimes, it is especially 
important to have two depths of measurement because the 
resistivity will vary in relation to the depth of fluid 
infiltration from the borehole. Thus, the drilling fluid 
filtrate flows into the adjacent formations to a depth 
dependent on the nature of the formation, the nature of the 
drilling fluid and other factors so that there is a 
variation in formation resistivity as a result of fluid 
infiltration. Since this depth of infiltration varies, it 
may be helpful to change the depth of investigation so that 
the actual depths of fluid infiltration can be determined. We have now devised a method of generating an 
electrical induction signal whereby a variable depth  
 
investigation can be conducted with the depth of 
investigation being adjustable. In the past, the only way 
of attempting to achieve this has used additional receiver 
coils installed at intermediate spacings. Whilst this has 
enabled an extension of the depth of investigation to a 
greater radial distance from the borehole, it has involved 
extra cost in terms of the complexity of the enhanced coil 
system, the multiplicity of coils involved, and the handling 
of data from the various coils. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method of generating an electrical induction 
signal for a formation at a specified distance extending 
radially outwardly from a well borehole in the formation, 
the method comprising the steps of: 
(a) disposing an induction logging tool within the well 
borehole; (b) generating a first electrical signal using said tool, 
said first electrical signal being correlative to 
conductivity of the formation at a first distance extending 
radially outwardly from the well borehole; (c) generating a second electrical signal using said 
tool, said second electrical
