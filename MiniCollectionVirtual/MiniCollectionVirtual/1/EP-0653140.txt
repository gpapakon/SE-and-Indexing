<DESCRIPTION>
 Subscriber services arrangement for mobile telec-XOTπunications system providing PABX access.TECHNICAL FIELDThe invention relates to a method and to an arrangement which relate to a mobile telephone network which is utilized by a plurality of mobile telephone stations. More particularly, the invention relates to a telephone system subscriber service arrangement and to a method of directing calls in a telephone system.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONHistorically, business telephone subscribers, i.e. employees using a telephone at their office, have been using a statio¬ nary private automated branch exchange (PABX) telephone. As soon as such a subscriber leaves his office, any incoming call has to be diverted to a secretary, a colleague etc.With newer technology, a business telephone subscriber may have a cordless telephone that makes him at least partially reachable when he is away from his office.The european patent application EP 462727 A2 describes how a limited number of mobile telephone stations in a mobile telephone network are given access to business services that normally only are available to the business telephone sub¬ scribers using the private exchange (PABX) . According to the european application, only mobile stations located in a limited area in the mobile network close to the private exchange are given access to the services. The application does not explain how services can be accessed by mobile stations located in a wide area. 

Employees who need to make and receive telephone calls wherever they are, have to use mobile telephone stations that have no direct connection to a PABX.Thus, the alternatives available today are to use either a stationary PABX telephone or a cordless telephone with limited range of use, using a private numbering plan, or a mobile telephone station with full mobility but with no PABX connec¬ tion, using a public numbering plan.In other words, with full mobility you lose business services and communicationpossibilities that you normally have within a PABX or within a private telecom network (PTN) comprising a number of PABXs.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONThe aforesaid problem to use business services of a private telecom network and still maintain movability is solved in accordance with the invention. One object of the present invention is thus to enable a user of a mobile telephone in a mobile telephone network to use subscriber services which are normally only available to subscribers located in a private telephone network. The intention of the invention is to enable
