<ABSTRACT>
A hardness-measurement device (6) is arranged between a treatment system (3), for example a continuous annealing furnace for metallic material (1) in the form of a continuous strip or wire, especially copper strip, and a take-up winder (11) for the copper strip (1). In addition, the copper strip (1) is guided flat under pressure over a support roll (10). A hardness-test device (13) which acts according to the ball rebound method is provided above the support roll (10). With the aid of this hardness-test device (13), in the case of continuous copper strip (1) the hardness of the latter can be determined and the speed of the copper strip (1) and/or the furnace temperature can thereby be regulated, so that the copper strips (1) fed sequentially through a continuous annealing furnace (3) have approximately equal qualities.

Method for determining the hardness of continuous metallic 
material (1) in strip or wire form, in particular copper strip, 

moving between a processing installation (3), in particular a 
continuous annealing furnace, and a winding reel (11), characterised 

in that the continuous material (1) is guided with defined constant 
tension in curved contact over a rotating support (10) and at the 

vertex of the support (10) is subjected to the action of the test 
ball of a hardness testing apparatus (13) working by the ball 

rebound method, the hardness value established from the measurements 
of impact and rebound speed of the test ball being used to control 

the speed of the continuous material (1) and/or the processing 
characteristics of the processing installation (3). 
Device for implementing the method according to patent claim 1, 
characterised by a support roller (10) disposed between the 

processing installation (3) and the winding reel (11) and rotating 
about an axis (9) extending at right angles to the direction of 

travel (LR) of the continuous material (1), by two contact rollers 
(7, 8) disposed before and after the support roller (10) and 

pressing the continuous material (1) against the support roller (10) 
in a curve on the vertex side, and by a hardness testing apparatus 

(13) working by the ball rebound method which is disposed above the 
support roller (10) and is coupled through an evaluating and control 

unit to the regulating system of the processing installation (3) 
and/or the drive of the winding reel (11). 
Device according to patent claim 2, characterised in that the 
support roller (10) and the contact rollers (7, 8) are coated with a 

hard plastic. 
Device according to patent claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the hardness testing apparatus (13) is adjustable in the 

longitudinal direction of the axis (9) of the support roller (10) 
and lockable in the particular adjustment position. 
Device according to one of patent claims 2 to 4, characterised  
 

in that the hardness testing apparatus (13) is fixed to a bracket 
(16) displaceable at right angles to the axis (9) of the support 

roller (10). 
Device according to patent claim 5, characterised in that the 
bracket (16) is adjustable by a pressure medium cylinder (30) 

relative to a fixed abutment (32). 
Device according to one of patent claims 2 to 6, characterised 
in that the hardness testing apparatus (13) exhibits a clamping part 

(17) which is fixed to a carrier (19) which is forcibly guided in 
the adjusting direction of the bracket (16) and is connected by 

means of a pressure medium cylinder (21) to the bracket (16). 
Device according to patent claim 7, characterised in that the 
distance (A) between the bracket (16) and the carrier (19) is 

adjustable. 
Device according to one of patent claims 2 to 8, characterised 
in that the hardness testing apparatus (13) can be activated by a 

pressure medium cylinder (26) fixed to the bracket (16).
