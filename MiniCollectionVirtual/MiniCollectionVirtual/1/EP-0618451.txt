<ABSTRACT>
A current transformer (10) having a conductor which forms an approximately U-shaped conductor loop (11) lying approximately in a plane and flowed through by the current to be measured, inside which conductor a coil (13) which can be connected to an electronic electricity meter is arranged, the windings of which lie parallel to the plane of the conductor loop (11), the conductor loop (11) and the coil (13) being enclosed by a cover made of a magnetically conducting material which also acts as screening. Easily producible construction and high long-term stability in operation are achieved if, according to the invention, the soft magnetic cover is made by at least one flat lamellar element (14) whose plane extends approximately perpendicularly to the plane of the conductor loop (11).
