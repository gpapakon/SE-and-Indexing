<DESCRIPTION>
 MEDICAL IMPLANT SYSTEMField of the InventionThe invention relates to a system which facilitates monitoring, treatment and stimulation of a living body. More particularly, this system relies upon the use of electromagnetic waves as the means of transmission of energy and signals between a device implantable inside the living body and an external control device.The invention, in a separate embodiment, also relates to a device that may be implanted inside the cardiovascular system so that properties of the environment within the body at which it is implanted may be monitored and a blood flow passage can be enlarged. The device is electrically powered and controlled by an external source of electromagnetic radiation.Background to the InventionWhilst the following description is in terms of particular applications eg. muscle stimulation and the use of stents, it is to be understood that the invention has wider application.A number of people all over the world lose their natural ability to control their muscle contraction and are thus physically disabled. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is a technique which incorporates the stimulation of muscles for providing functionality to people suffering from neuromotor control disorders or have otherwise lost their natural ability to control and contract their muscles usefully. The disorder or loss of natural ability can arise through a range of causes, including disease, trauma or stroke.FES devices can be classified into two categories - implants and external. External FES devices include simple devices such as those used to correct drop foot, and have been in use for a few decades. The implantable devices are relatively new and the first commercialisation of such a device took place in 1997.In the present art, implantable devices consist of a controller and a set of up to 16 electrodes connected by wires which run inside the body (Memberg, Peckham, Keith, "A Surgically Implant Intramuscular Electrode for An Implantable Neuromuscular Stimulation System", IEEE trans.Rehab.Eng, vol. 2, no.2, Jun 1994). In this art, the device does not 

have any internal power source but it is powered by an oscillating magnetic field from the power source coupled with the secondary pick up coil implanted within the patient as a component of the device.FES devices have been reported which provide this format (US Patent No. 5,358,514 to Schulman et al; Matjacic et al "Wireless Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation Systems", PMnD:9148704, UI:97205715; Sawan, Hassouna et al
