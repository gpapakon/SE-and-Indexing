<ABSTRACT>
A method of vibrationally damping an article 
subject to resonant vibrations comprises applying to 

the article a vibration damping structure that 
comprises a first vibration damping material and a 

second vibration damping material different from the 
first vibration damping material. The first and second 

vibration damping materials are arranged in a single 
layer and each is in direct mechanical contact with the 

article.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method 
for vibrationally damping an article subject to 
resonant vibrations and, more particularly, to a method 
of using a single layer of at least two different 
vibration damping materials to provide damping over a 
broad temperature range. A myriad of articles as diverse as motor 
vehicle engine components and computer hardware may be 
subject to undesirable resonant vibrations. 
Consequently, it is often desirable to attenuate the 
resonant vibrations by providing the article with a 
damping structure. Typical vibration damping 
structures comprise a viscoelastic material for so-called 
free-layer vibration damping. The viscoelastic 
material can be supplemented with an optional, 
relatively stiff constraining layer to provide 
constrained layer damping. Articles such as those mentioned above may 
experience resonant vibrations over a wide temperature 
range. For example, motor vehicle engine components 
may experience extremely cold temperatures well below 
freezing in certain northern climates as well as much 
higher temperatures in desert environments or when the 
engine is in use. Resistance to shock, especially at 
lower temperatures, may also be important; low 
temperature shock can lead to delamination of the 
damping material. However, it may be difficult for a 
single vibration damping material to provide the 
requisite damping (and shock resistance if needed) over 
the temperature range to which the article may be  
 
exposed. One presently known solution to this problem 
is to use two different damping materials, one to 
provide damping at lower temperatures, and the other to 
provide damping at higher temperatures. 
Conventionally, the two damping materials are arranged 
in a multilayer configuration with only one of the two 
materials (typically the high temperature damping 
material) in direct mechanical contact with the article 
to be damped. However, at low temperatures, this 
damping material may be susceptible to shock type 
mechanical failure. In extreme cases, the vibration 
damping structure may fall off. While adhesives or mechanical tabs may be 
used to further secure the damping materials to the 
article, this increases manufacturing and application 
complexity, adds weight, increases cost, and may be 
impractical in situations where there is limited space 
for these additional components. Placing the low 
temperature damping material, rather than the high 
temperature damping material, in direct mechanical 
contact with the article is
