<ABSTRACT>
In a thermal printer, data in the form of character data 
separated by gaps is supplied over a data line (38) to a shift 

register (15), the latched outputs of which cause operation of 
thermal elements (R₁-R
N
) in a thermal printhead (11). During 
a test mode of operation, test data is supplied to operate the 

thermal elements (R₁-R
N
) in succession, a sensing resistor 
(R
S
) providing corresponding test signals which are digitized 
by an AD converter (39). Each digitized test signal is 

compared with an associated initial, stored, digitized test 
signal, and if the current value deviates by more than a 

predetermined amount from the initial value, a failure signal 
is provided. A processor (19) is thereupon effective to cause 

the subsequent character data to be shifted such that the 
defective element is aligned with a location which is not used 

for printing, such as an intercharacter gap. In a modification, 
the test signals for all the thermal elements (R₁-R
N
) are 
compared with a common fixed, predetermined reference 

level.
