<CLAIMS>
A process for the purification of organic compounds
contaminated by dissolved metal compounds, which

comprises bringing the contaminated organic compound
into contact with an ion exchanger resin based on

polyacrylates, polyacrylic acids, polyacrylamides,
phenol-formaldehyde resins, polyalkylamine resins or

based on a divinylbenzene-crosslinked polystyrene,
the functional group of which ion exchanger resin

contains both a secondary amine group and a phosphonate
radical and/or phosphonic acid radical.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
contaminated organic compound contains a dissolved

iron, nickel, chromium, cobalt, copper and/or lead
salt.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
contaminated organic compound used is a halogenated

organic compound.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
3, wherein the contaminated organic compound used is

a halogenated aromatic compound.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to

3, wherein the contaminated organic compound used is
an unsubstituted or substituted chlorinated nitrobenzene,

in particular m-chloronitrobenzene. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
5, wherein an ion exchanger resin based on a divinylbenzene-crosslinked

polystyrene is used.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
6, wherein the functional group of the ion exchanger

resin corresponds to the formula -(CH
2
)
m
NH(CH
2
)
n
PO
3
X
2
,
in which m and n, independently of each other, are

respectively an integer from 1 to 8, in particular
1 to 4, and X is a hydrogen atom or a metal atom, in

particular an alkali metal atom.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
7, wherein the functional group corresponds to the

formula -CH
2
NHCH
2
PO
3
Na
2
.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
8, wherein the organic compound is brought into

contact with the ion exchanger resin at 0 to 100, in
particular at 20 to 80Â°C.
