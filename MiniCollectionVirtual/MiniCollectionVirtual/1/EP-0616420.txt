<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electronic device having very low consumption. The device consists of a series of stages (1, 1') in cascade, with respect to the input signal (e), and the bias terminals of which (24 - 29) are connected in series with the power supply (13, 14). Application to a receiver of remote-control signals installed on board a vehicle.

Intermediate-frequency amplifier, characterised in that it 
has first (Q1) and second (Q2) amplification transistors whose 

connector-emitter paths are connected in series between two high-potential 
and low-potential supply lines (Va), with respective 

windings on two tuned transformers (T1, T2), so that the input 
signal (Ve) progresses in a cascade through the base of the first 

transistor (Q1), its collector, the transformer (T1), the base 
of the second transistor (Q2) and its collector as far as the 

output (V) of the amplifier, whilst the biasing components (R1, 
R2, D1, R3) of the first and second transistors (Q1, Q2) are in 

series. 
Intermediate-frequency amplifier according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the transistor (Q2) is decoupled from the 

high-frequency point of view by means of a capacitor (C3) 
connected between earth and the emitter of the transistor (Q2). 
Amplifier according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
includes a temperature compensation device connected to the base 

of the transistor (Q1), the compensation device being able to 
consist of a diode or a transistor. 
Amplifier according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
includes an automatic gain correction circuit which includes a 

means (40, Fig 6) of detecting the level of the output signal 
(B), which may consist of a transistor (Q4) connected to the 

output (B) of the amplifier and whose collector as an output is 
connected to the control electrode (42) for a controllable 

current source (41) which may consist of a transistor (Q3) whose 
collector as output is connected to the input (-) of an adder 

(34, Fig 2) which may consist of an input of a prior amplifier 
stage such as the emitter of the first transistor (Q1) so as to 

withdraw more or less current from the first transistor and 
thereby to withdraw more or less of the output voltage level of 

the second transistor (Q2).  
 
Receiver for a signal such as a remote-control signal, 
characterised in that it includes an intermediate-frequency 

amplifier according to the invention.
