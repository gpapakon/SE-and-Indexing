<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-efficiency 
direct-current converter, better known as DC-to-DC 
converter. The use of DC converters is now well-known in the field 
of electronics. DC converters are used in devices and 
circuits whose voltage or current source is unsuitable to 
supply all the components or elements included in the device 
or circuit. For example, in digital circuit systems it is easy to 
find a supply voltage of +5V which is not suitable to supply 
an operational amplifier which might require a voltage of 
+15V. Known converters are constituted by a constant-voltage 
generator and by a load. An output capacitor is connected in 
parallel to the load. An inductor and a diode, arranged in 
series, are placed between the generator and the load. One 
terminal of a switch is connected to the contact point of 
the inductor and of the diode, whereas the other terminal of 
the inductor is connected to the ground. The switch 
discharges the inductive energy stored in the inductor to 
prevent the current applied across the load from reaching 
excessive values. The desired output voltage is obtained by 
means of the controlled switching of the switch. The drawback of these converters is that the electronic 
components handle the entire power supplied by the 
converter, i.e.

P = VOUT x IOUT

 
 
where VOUT is the output voltage and IOUT is the output 
current. These converters accordingly have high consumption. Since the power supply sources often have a short life 
(e.g. batteries) or there is a need for limited consumption, 
it is desirable to have a DC converter that is highly 
efficient. Furthermore, there is always the need to have DC 
converters that obtain the same output characteristic but 
subject the components to lower current and voltage values, 
extending their life or requiring components with lower 
power ratings. The aim of the present invention is to provide a DC 
converter which is more efficient than known converters. Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present 
invention is to provide a DC converter which consumes less 
and requires smaller components with a lower power rating. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
converter which is highly reliable, relatively easy to 
manufacture and at competitive costs. This aim, these objects and others which will become 
apparent hereinafter are achieved by a DC-to-DC converter 
which comprises a voltage generator, a load which is 
connected in series to said generator, an inductor which is 
connected
