Method for the grinding of groove-shaped external profiles of work pieces, 
particularly for the grinding of the teeth of straight and helical spur gears, i.e., profile 

sections of one and the same work piece arc simultaneously machined by two grinding 

wheels which arc profiled acc. to the external profile contours of the work pieces. The 
metal is removed by opposite feed movement and joint stroking travel of the two 

grinding wheels.
 
The method is characterised by: 


a) that a control unit calculates the axial distance between the two grinding wheels 
(4.1 and 4.2) acc. to the distance of the groove-shaped external profiles of the 

work piece (2) and consequently, determines the finish-grinding positions (10) 
of the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2), 
b) then the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) are moved into these positions and 
remain positioned there, 
c) then a dressing tool (1), which is moved along the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 
4.2) by continuous path control acc. to an existing computer program and work 

profile, profiles the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) one after the other, and 
generates a surface roughness suitable for roughing on the two grinding wheels 

(4.1 and 4.2), 
d) after this dressing procedure for roughing the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) 
are moved into the rough-grinding positions (11) which have been calculated by 

the control unit under consideration of the grinding stock, and they remain 
positioned there, 
e) then the work piece (2) is rough-ground, 
f) after termination of the rough-grinding the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) are 
moved into the finish-grinding positions (10), which also are used as dressing 

positions, and remain positioned there, 
g) then the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) are re-profiled one after the other by 
the dressing tool (1) analogous to the dressing procedure for the rough-grinding 

to generate a surface suitable for finish-grinding on the two grinding wheels 
(4.1 and 4.2), 
h) after this dressing for finish-grinding the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) 
remain in their positions (10) and finish-grinding of the work piece (2) takes 

place in those positions (10). 
Method acc. to claim 1, characterised by:
 
that the dressing procedure for the grinding wheels for the grinding of gear wheels 

runs preferably acc. to the following steps of the method: 

i) The position of the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) being adjustable 
tangentially in the plane normal to the work piece (2) and symmetrical to the 

profile centre line (7) such that the distance related to the pitch cylinder between 
the outer grinding surfaces of the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) 

amounts to

d

j) Dressing infeed movement 

radially to the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) by the amount a

 for 
vitrified - bond corundum grinding wheels, or 
combined radially (a

) and tangentially (a

) with the ratio 

a

for vitrified-bond CBN-grinding wheels to reduce grinding wheel wear. Where 

"α" is the profile angle at the pitch circle, and the tangential component of the 
dressing feed (a
dt
) is passed by the grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) each. 
k) Moving the dressing tool (1) from a defined stand-by position W1 (W2) to the 
other stand-by position W2 (W1) and the calculated profile is sequentially 

generated on the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) in a closed dressing cycle.  
 
l) Dressing compensation performed by 

re-adjusting the two grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) radially by the amount l
anr
 
with radial dressing feed 
l
anr
 = a

 relative to the work piece (2), or 
re-adjusting radially by the amount l

whereby the

the tangential dressing infeed component.

grinding wheels (4.1 and 4.2) have a common axis of rotation (15) along which
