by one or more substituents selected from the same or different halogen atoms, alkoxy groups and a cyano group; 
R² represents ethyl or n-propyl; R³ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R⁴ represents hydrogen; R⁵, R⁶ and R⁷ 

represent each independently hydrogen or lower alkyl; R⁸ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; Z¹ and Z² represent 
each independently oxygen or sulfur; Z³ represents oxygen or sulfur; Q represents phenyl; m represents an integer of 

0 to 2; and n represents an integer of 0 or 1. This derivative has a high control effect on downy mildew of cucumber, 
diseases of tomato and downy mildew of grape. Further it is excellent in the capability of penetration and migration, 

residual effect and rainfall resistance without causing crop injury.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amino-acid amide derivative as 
well as to an agricultural or horticultural fungicide containing the same 
as an active ingredient. The present invention also relates to a process 
for preparing the same. Amino-acid amide derivatives have been disclosed as 
intermediates for medicines in Japanese Patent Application, First 
Publication Nos. Sho 56-8352 and Sho 62-89696. However, these 
documents fail to disclose the utility of the amino-acid amide 
derivatives. Although Japanese Patent Application First Publication 
Nos. Hei 3-5451, Hei 3-153657, Hei 4-230652, Hei 4-230653, Hei 4-283554, 
Hei 4-308507, and Hei 4-338372 disclose that some amino-acid 
amides are useful for biocides, the compounds disclosed in these 
documents are different from the amino-acid amide derivatives 
according to the present invention. Analytical Biochemistry, vol. 192, no. 2, pp 419-425 
discloses the compound 
 
for use in peptide synthesis. Beijing Daxue Xuebao, Ziran Kexueban 1984, (6), pp 59-65 
discloses the peptide derivatives  
 
 
wherein R is Me or i-Pr as having an anti arrhythmic effect. Khim Geterosikl. Soedin. 1974 (4), pp 510-514 discloses the 
compound 
 
for use in a chemical synthesis. The present inventors have synthesized various amino-acid amide 
derivatives and have carried out extensive research in connection with 
their effects on the physiological activities of fungi. As a result, we 
have found that the compounds according to the present invention 
exhibit a broad spectrum of anti-fungal activity especially against 
cucumber downy mildew, grape downy mildew, and tomato late blight, 
and at the same time they do not hinder desirable plant growth. According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided 
an amino-acid amide derivative represented by the formula:  
 
 
wherein 
R1 represents 
a C1-6 alkyl group (optionally having at least one same or 
different substituent selected from the group consisting of a halogen 
atom, an alkoxy group, and a cyano group), a C2-6 alkenyl group, a C2-6 alkynyl group, a cycloalkyl group (optionally having at least one same or 
different substituent selected from the group consisting of methyl group 
and a halogen atom), a cycloalkylalkyl group, a cycloalkenyl group, an alkylene oxide group, an aralkyl group (optionally having at least one same or different 
substituent selected from the group consisting of a methyl group, a 
cyano group, and a nitro group), a phenyl group (optionally having at least one same or different
