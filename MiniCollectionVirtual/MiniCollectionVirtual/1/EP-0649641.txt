<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an acetabular cup for insertion in osseous tissue, with an external metal cup (1) and an internal sliding cup (2), the sliding cup (2) being fixed in the metal cup (1) with the aid of a conical clamp. In order to protect the acetabular insert and the sliding cup (2) against twisting and falling out, in a manner such that they can nevertheless be pressed out of their seats and exchanged without being destroyed, the angle ( alpha ) of the conical clamp is between 10 DEG  and 25 DEG  according to the invention.

<CLAIMS>
Hip-joint socket for insertion in osseous
tissue, having an outer, closed metal shell (1) and an

inner sliding shell (2), wherein the sliding shell (2)
is fixed in the metal shell (1) with the aid of a

conical clamping, the sliding shell (2) is made of
ceramics, the angle (α) of the conical clamping is

between 10° and 25°, and arranged in the metal shell
(1), on the contact surface with respect to the sliding

shell (2), is at least one recess (3), into which can
be inserted an ejection tool, with which a levering-out

of the sliding shell (2) is rendered possible.
Hip-joint socket according to claim 1,
characterized in that the angle (α) of the conical

clamping is 18°.
Hip-joint socket according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the at least one recess (3)

extends until underneath the conical clamping.
Hip-joint socket according to one of claims 1
to 3, characterised in that two recesses (3, 4) are

arranged in a manner such that they are diametrically
opposed.
Combination of a hip-joint socket according to
one of claims 1 to 4 and an ejection tool,

characterised in that the ejection tool has the shape
of a golf club and by rotating the ejection tool, a

force can be exerted on the sliding shell (2) from
underneath.
