<DESCRIPTION>
 LIQUID OR GEL DISHWASHING DETERGENTCONTAINING ALKYL ETHOXY CARBOXYLATE,DIVALENT IONS AND ALKYLPOLYETHOXYPOLYCARBOXYLATETECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to liquid or gel dishwashing detergent compositions containing alkyl ethoxy carboxylate surfactant, calcium or magnesium ions, and alkylpolyethoxypoly¬ carboxylate surfactant.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Liquid or gel dishwashing detergents with good grease removal benefits are very desirable. The addition of calcium or magnesium ions to certain liquid or gel dishwashing detergents may improve the grease removal benefits of the composition. However, it may be necessary to limit the pH and/or add chelating agents to these compositions to obtain a stable product. As concentrated products become increasingly more popular, it is an important advantage in formulating a liquid or gel dishwashing detergent composition that the ingredients of the composition contribute a variety of benefits.It has been found that certain alkylpolyethoxypolycarboxylate surfactants when added to a liquid or gel dishwashing detergent composition containing calcium and/or magnesium ions and alkyl ethoxy carboxylate surfactant and having a pH of from about 7 to about 11, prevent insoluble salt precipitation and may, if present in sufficient quantities, also act as a hydrotrope and a surfactant.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A liquid or gel dishwashing detergent composition comprising, by weight:(a) from about 5% to about 95% of an alkyl ethoxy surfactant of the general formula;RO(CH2CH2θ)xCH2COO-M+ 

wherein R is a C12 to C15 alkyl group, x ranges from 0 to about 10 and the ethoxylate distribution is such that, on a weight basis, the amount of material where x is 0 is less than about 20% and the amount of material where x is greater than 7 is less than about 25%, the average x is from about 2 to 4 when the average R is C13 or less, and the average x is from about 3 to 6 when the average R is greater than C13, and M is a cation;(b) from about 0.1% to about 4% of calcium or magnesium ions; *nd (c) from about 0.001% to about 15% of an alkylpolyethoxypolycarboxylate surfactant having the general formula:R - 0 - (CH - CH - 0)x - R3I ! Rl R2 wherein R is a Cβ to Cis alkyl group, x ranges from about 1 to about 24, Ri and R2 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl acid radical succinic acid moiety, hydroxy succinic acid radical and mixtures thereof, wherein at least one Ri or R2 is a succinic acid moiety; wherein said composition has a pH in a 10% solution in water
