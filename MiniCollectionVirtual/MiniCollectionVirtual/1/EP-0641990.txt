Container (1) for packaging an object (2) provided
with a radio frequency transmission device and

including an interface which, on the one hand, is linked
to the said object (2) and, on the other hand, includes

a connector which is accessible from outside the said
container (1), characterized:


in that the said interface is a removable element (5)
capable of blanking off an aperture (6) of the said

container (1) and bearing, on the one hand, at least
one radio frequency antenna (17 to 20) and, on the

other hand, at least one such connector (23 to 26), of
coaxial type, the said antenna and the said coaxial

connector being linked electrically to one another; and
in that, when the said removable element (5) is in
position blanking off the said aperture (6), the said

coaxial connector (23 to 26) is accessible from outside
the said container (1), while the said antenna (17 to

20) is internal to the said container and is capable of
being coupled in radio frequency terms with the said

radio frequency transmission device of the said object
(2) packaged in the said container (1).
Container according to claim 1, characterized in
that the said aperture (6) is specifically formed for the

said removable element (5).
Container according to either of claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the said aperture (6) is provided

in the upper wall (4) of the said container.
Container according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it includes a simple stopper,

capable of taking the place of the said removable element
in the said aperture, during periods when radio frequency

links are not necessary.
Removable element (5) for blanking off an aperture
(6) of a container (1) intended for packaging an

object (2) provided with a radio frequency transmission
device, characterized in that it bears, on the one hand,

at least one radio frequency antenna (17 to 20) and, on
the other hand, at least one coaxial connector (23 to 

26), the said antenna and the said coaxial connector
being linked electrically to one another in such a way

that, when the said removable element (5) is in position
blanking off the said aperture (6), the said coaxial connector

(23 to 26) is accessible from outside the said
container (1), while the said antenna (17 to 20) is

internal to the said container and is capable of being
coupled in radio frequency terms with the said radio

frequency transmission device of the said object (2)
packaged in the said container (1).
Removable element according to claim 5, characterized
in that it includes a blanking plate (10),

capable of blanking off the said aperture (6) and provided
with the said coaxial connector (23 to 26) which

passes through it, and a panel (11) integral with the
said blanking plate (10) and bearing the said radio

frequency antenna (17 to 20), the said panel (11) being
capable of passing through the said aperture (6).
Removable element according to claim 6, characterized
in that the said blanking plate (10) is cylindrical

and in that the said panel (11) is integral with the
inner end face (12) of the said blanking plate (10).
Removable element according to either of claims
6 and 7, characterized in that the said panel (11) is

arranged radially with respect to the said blanking plate
(10).
Removable element according to one of claims 6 to
8, characterized in that the said antenna (17 to 20) is

arranged on the face (15) of the said panel (11)
intended, in position blanking off the said removable

element, to be facing the said object (2).
Removable element according to claim 9, characterized
in that the face (16) of the panel (11) opposite

the said face (15) intended to be facing the said object
(2) carries the circuit of the said antenna (17 to 20).
Removable element according to one of claims 5 to
10, characterized in that it includes a plurality of

radio frequency antennae (17 to 20) each corresponding to
a specific radio frequency transmission and an equal 

number of coaxial connectors, associated respectively
with the antennae.
