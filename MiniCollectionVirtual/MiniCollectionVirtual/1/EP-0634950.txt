<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a golf club (66) of the iron type (a one iron through a nine iron wherein the hosel (82) is formed intermediate heel (78) and tow (76) portions of the club with the front face (72) of the club head having a substantially uniform height from the toe portion (76) to the heel portion (78) to thereby provide a greater latitude of error when the ball is struck off center.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to golf clubs and 
more particularly, related to golf clubs of the iron-type. Over the years, there have been many different 
approaches taken to the design and construction of iron type 
golf clubs has been taken. Generally the golf club heads 
have, however, remained substantially uniform wherein there 
is a front face, a back face, a sole, a toe portion, a heel 
portion and a hosel portion. Conventionally, the hosel is 
formed at the heel of the club. The front face of the club 
head (and the rear face) are normally designed such that the 
face has a greater height near the toe portion than near the 
heel portion. When hitting a golf shot, a great deal of skill is 
required and missed shots are frequent, particularly among 
those of relatively lesser skill. Thus, if the ball is not 
struck squarely on the "sweet spot" of the club, a 
misdirected shot will occur. In other words, when the ball 
is hit either near the heel or toe portions of the club, a 
poor shot normally results. It is known in French Publication 2,611,510 to 
provide a golf club wherein the shaft is attached to the 
club head at a point intermediate the toe and heel portions 
of the club head. This reference shows the use of a 
conventional head face and does not provide for an 
engineered weighting of the club. A further arrangement is shown in British Patent  
 
1,456,981 wherein a conventional arrangement for attachment 
of the shaft to the club head is provided, but with a club 
head face that has a substantially uniform height from its 
toe to heel portion. Weighting is achieved through recesses 
formed in the back face of the golf club. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a golf club head of the iron-type which provides a 
larger margin of error compared to a conventional golf club 
when the ball is hit near the toe or heel areas of the club 
face. According to one aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a golf club of the iron type which 
includes a shaft and a club head wherein the club head has a 
heel portion, a toe portion, a sole, a hosel, a front face 
and a rear face, with the front face being of a 
substantially planar nature being bounded by a bottom edge 
adjacent a sole portion of the club, an upper edge, a first 
side edge proximate the heel portion and a second side edge 
proximate the toe portion. The club is characterized in 
that the hosel extends upwardly from a point intermediate 
the heel portion and the toe portion, the hosel terminating 
in a plane

<CLAIMS>
A golf club of the iron type comprising a shaft (68) and a club head (30, 66), said club 
head having a heel portion (40, 78), a toe portion (38, 76), a sole (36, 80), a hosel 

(42, 82), a front face (32, 72) and a rear face (34, 74), said front face being of a 
substantially planar nature and being bounded by a bottom edge adjacent a sole 

portion of the club, an upper edge, a first side edge proximate said heel portion (40, 
78) and a second side edge proximate said toe portion (38, 76),
 
characterized in that said hose (42, 82) extends upwardly from a point intermediate 

said heel portion (40, 78) and said toe portion (4o, 78), said hose (42, 82) 
terminating in a plane which extends substantially parallel to and tangential with said 

side edge at said heel portion (40, 78), and which plane is also substantially normal 
to parallel planes extending along said top and bottom edges. 
The golf club of claim 1 wherein said front face (32, 72) has a height (Y) at said side 
edge proximate said toe portion (38, 76) substantially equal to the height of the side 

edge proximate said heel portion (40, 78). 
The golf club of claim 2 wherein said sole portion (36, 80) extends rearwardly from 
the bottom edge of said front face (32, 72) in a flange like projection, said sole 

portion (36, 80) extending rearwardly adjacent the toe portion (38, 76) of the club 
head (30, 66) for a distance which is greater than the distance adjacent the heel 

portion (40, 78) of the club head (30, 66). 
The golf club of claim 3 wherein said front face (32, 72) has a plurality of parallel 
grooves (44) extending substantially parallel to the sole (36, 80) and between the toe 

portion (38, 76) and heel portion (40, 78), all the grooves being of a substantially  
 

uniform length. 
A golf club of the iron type selected from the group consisting of a one iron through a 
nine iron, said golf club having a shaft (68) and a club head (66), the club head 

having a toe portion (76), a heel portion (78), a sole (80), a substantially planar front 
face (72) being defined by a bottom edge adjacent said sole (80)and side edges 

adjacant said heel and toe portions (78, 76) of the club head (66), a rear face (74) and 
a top edge,
 
characterized in that a hosel (82) extends from a point intermediate said toe portion 

(76) and said heel portion (78) and is formed to extend from said rear face (74) of said 
club head (66) upwardly and outwardly therefrom, said sole (80) extending 

rearwardly from the bottom of said front face (72) in a flange like projection, said sole 
(80) extending rearwardly adjacent the toe portion (76) of the club head (66) for a 

distance which is greater than the distance which it extends rearwardly adjacent the 
heel portion (78) of the club head (66), said front face (72) and rear face (74) being 

substantially parallel such that said club head (66) has a substantially uniform 
thickness except adjacent said sole (80) and said hose (82). 
The golf club of claim 5 wherein said front face (72) has a substantially uniform 
height. 
The golf club of claim 6 wherein said face (72) has a plurality of parallel grooves (44) 
extending substantially parallel to the sole (80) and between the toe portion (76) and 

heel portion (78), all of said grooves being of a substantially uniform lenght.
