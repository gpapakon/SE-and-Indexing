<ABSTRACT>
In a fossil-fuelled steam generator (1) with a flue, the containig wall (2) of which takes the form of gastightly interconnected pipes (4), which are substantially vertically arranged and through which the medium can flow from bottom to top, the invention proposes that the pipes (4) have a greater inside diameter (d1) in a first or lower part (5) of the flue than the pipes (4) in a superimposed second part (7) of the flue. This ensures that the pipes (4) are reliably cooled. In addition, a greater than average heating of individual pipes (4) does not lead to unacceptable temperature differences between the outlets of the pipes (4).

Fossil-fired continuous-flow steam generator
with a gas flue, the surrounding wall (2) of which is

formed from tubes (4) connected to each other in a
gastight manner, which tubes are arranged substantially

vertically and can conduct an upward flow of a medium,

characterized in that the tubes (4) in a lower first
part (5) of the gas flue have a larger inner diameter

(d
1
) than the tubes (4) in a second part (7) of the gas
flue which is above the first part.
Steam generator according to claim 1,

characterized in that the tubes (4) with the smaller
inner diameter (d
2
) are connected directly to the tubes
(4) with the larger inner diameter (d
1
) or merge into
them.
Steam generator according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that each tube (4) is connected by way
of a pressure balance tube (27) to a pressure balance

vessel (26) provided outside the gas flue.
Steam generator according to claim 3,

characterized in that each pressure balance tube (27)
lies in the upper half of the first part (5),

preferably in the upper third of the first part (5),
for example in the area (25) of the transition from the

first part (5) to the second part (7) of the gas flue.
Steam generator according to one of claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the tubes (4) in the first

part (5) of the gas flue have a thread-like internal
finning.
Steam generator according to one of claims 1
to 5, characterized in that the tubes (4) in the second

part (7) of the gas flue have a thread-like inner
finning at least over a part of their length.
Steam generator according to one of claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the mean mass flow density

in the tubes (4) of the first part (5) of the gas flue 
is less than or equal to 1000 kg/m
2
s with full load.
Steam generator according to claim 1,

characterized in that the tubes (4) in an upper third
part (8) of the gas flue have a larger inner diameter

than in the second part (7) of the gas flue which lies
below the third part.
Steam generator according to claim 8,

characterized in that the tubes (4) of the third part
(8) with the larger inner diameter are directly

connected to the tubes (4) of the second part (7) with
the smaller inner diameter (d
2
), or merge into them.
Steam generator according to claim 8 or 9,

characterized in that the number of tubes (4) in the
third part (8) of the gas flue is only half that in the

second part (7) of the gas flue, whereby in each case
two tubes (4) of the second part (7) open into a tube

(4), associated with both of them, of the third part
(8).
