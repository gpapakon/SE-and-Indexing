<ABSTRACT>
A boat canopy (14) is rapidly attached and detached to a windshield (12) with a continuous flexible member (40) having a flat plate (41) joined to the inside surface of the periphery of the canopy (14), with a lateral riser (44) and first (46) and second (50) locking segments extending from the riser (44). The locking segments (46, 50) are pushed into a continuous, upwardly and outwardly facing slot (31) arrangement of a corresponding gripping member (16) fixed to the upper extremity of the boat windshield (12). The sides of the canopy are rapidly attached and detached to a side frame (110) of the windshield through the use of detent pins (146) extending through lateral holes (117, 127) in the side frame (110) extrusion and the ends of the canopy struts (160).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and methods for attaching 
a flexible canopy to a boat windshield and frame. A variety of techniques have been described in the prior art for 
attaching a canopy or similar cover to a fixed structure, such as a boat windshield. 
Typically, metal fastening systems are utilized along the edge of the fixed 
structure, with mating fasteners on the cover. Examples of such arrangements are 
shown in the following United States patents: 4,750,449 to Muhlberger; 
2,961,725 to McGhie; 2,937,652 to Zimmer et al.; 3,416,282 to Daugherty; 
3,093,845 to Brock et al.; 2,961,725 to McGee; 3,021,535 to Dorst; 3,930,738 to 
Thuss et al.; and 4,993,351 to Zirkelbach et al. Canadian Patent 685,026 is also of 
interest. Continuous flexible fasteners are also well known in the prior art. 
Such arrangements employ a flexible bead or similar structure which is pressed 
continuously into a slot or channel for locking, and then is removed by pulling the 
bead away from the slot. Prior art document GB 2 261 703 A discloses a fastener 
for rapidly attaching a cover or canopy to a windshield. However, such 
arrangements have not been generally used in the past for large structures, because 
of the requirements for strength, rigidity and resistance to wind loading. The present invention provides an apparatus and method for rapidly 
attaching a canopy or similar cover to a fixed structure such as a boat windshield 
assembly, in an arrangement utilizing a flexible locking member and strut 
attachment system which permits rapid attachment and detachment to and from a 
boat windshield assembly or similar fixed structure in a simple and convenient 
manner, and which also provides sufficient strength and rigidity to achieve desired  
 
resistance to wind loading and other adverse environmental conditions. The present invention provides an arrangement of a boat canopy and 
windshield assembly, the arrangement comprising: a boat canopy having a 
forward, peripheral edge and an inside surface; a flexible member having a flat 
plate portion extending parallel with and joined to the inside surface of the 
peripheral edge of the boat canopy, the flexible member including riser means 
extending laterally from the flat plate portion and first and second locking 
segments extending laterally from the riser means; a boat windshield assembly 
incorporating a windshield having an upper extremity; a gripping member fixed to 
the upper extremity of the boat windshield, the gripping member having a 
continuous,

inside surface (15); a flexible member (40) having a flat plate portion 

(41) extending parallel with and joined to the inside surface (15) of 
the peripheral edge (36) of the boat canopy (14), the flexible member 

(40) including riser means (44) extending laterally from the flat plate 
portion (41) and first and second locking segments (46, 50) extending 

laterally from the riser means (44);

upper extremity (13); 
a gripping member (16) fixed to the upper extremity (13) of the boat 
windshield (12), the gripping member (16) having a continuous, 

upwardly and outwardly facing slot means (31) extending generally 
parallel with the upper extremity (13) of the boat windshield (12) and 

dimensioned to receive the first and second segments (46,50) of the 
flexible member (40); 
the boat canopy (14) being attachable to the windshield assembly by 
continuously pushing the first and second segments (46,50) of the 

flexible member (40) into the slot means (31) of the gripping member 
(16), and being detachable from the windshield assembly by pulling 

the peripheral edge (36) of the boat canopy (14) upward and away 
from the gripping member (16); characterised in that the boat canopy 

(14) includes at least one strut (160); the windshield assembly 
includes a side frame (110); and the arrangement (10) further 

comprises means for rapidly attaching and detaching an end of the at 
least one strut (160) to the side frame (110).
