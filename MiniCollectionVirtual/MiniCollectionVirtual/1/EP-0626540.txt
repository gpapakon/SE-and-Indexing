<ABSTRACT>
In the disposal of assorted scrap materials, esp. ferrous and/or non-ferrous metal scrap, which is lacquered and plastics coated and/or mixed with plastics and other organic cpds,. in a coke-heated shaft furnace, the novelty is that: (i) the scrap is degassed and/or gasified in the upper shaft region; (ii) the resulting dust-laden gases are completely withdrawn as circulated gas; (iii) the circulated gas is combusted with oxygen in the melting and superheating zone; (iv) the gas then flows through the incandescent coke and charge column; and (v) excess gas exits between the circulated gas suction withdrawal opening and the melting and superheating zone. In the appts. a circulated gas suction ring (1), with suction openings (2) uniformly distributed around the shaft periphery is located at least 500 mm below the max. charge column height and is connected by a circulated gas line (3) to a circulated gas distribution ring (4). The distribution ring (4) is connected by feed lines (5) to tuyeres (6) in the lower shaft region. Excess gas nozzles (8) are installed between the melting and superheating zone (7) and the circulated gas suction openings (2) and is connected to conventional equipment such as a gas quencher (9) and gas cleaning and heat recovery units (10), forming the excess gas exhaust system (11).

Process for the disposal of waste materials of 
variable composition, in particular of painted ferrous 

metal and/or nonferrous metal scrap with adhering plastic 
and/or mixed with plastic and other organic compounds, in 

a coke-heated shaft furnace, characterized in that 

the charged waste materials are degassed and/or 
gasified in the upper shaft region, 
the resulting dusty gases are taken off completely as 
circulated gas, 
then burned with oxygen in the melting and superheating 
zone of the furnace, 
then flow through the red-hot coke and charge column, 
and 
the resulting excess gas exits from the furnace between 
circulated gas take-off port and melting and superheating 

zone. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the circulated gas is taken off via a transport 

device, for example a radial fan and/or an oxygen-driven 
gas jet compresser. 
Process according to Claim 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the excess gas is taken off by a transport 

device, for example by a fan or a vapour jet compressor, 
and fed to a known waste heat utilization, shock cooling 

and dedusting. 
Process according to Claim 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the excess gas is fed in a manner dependent on 

furnace pressure. 
Process according to Claim 1 and 2, characterized 
in that, in the area of the melting and superheating  

 
zone, external gas mixtures are admixed and burned with 

oxygen under control. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the gas mixtures are incompletely burned and/or 

pollutant-containing process gases. 
Process according to Claim 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the temperature of the circulated gas to be 

burned is higher than that of the dew point of the 
circulated gas. 
Process according to Claim 1 and 2, characterized 
in that dusts are added in the area of the melting and 

superheating zone. 
Coke-heated shaft furnace for carrying out the 
process according to Claim 1 to 8, characterized in that 

a circulated gas take-off ring (1) having circulated gas 
take-off ports (2) uniformly distributed over the shaft 

periphery is arranged at least 500 mm below the maximum 
charge column height, this circulated gas take-off ring 

is connected by a circulated gas line (3) to a circulated 
gas distributor ring (4), from which a plurality of 

tapping lines (5) extend to the gas feed nozzle (6) lying 
in the lower shaft area, and in that excess gas nozzles 

(8) are installed above the melting and superheating zone 
between the circulated gas distributor ring (4) and the 

circulated gas take-off ports (2), which excess gas 
nozzles are connected to known devices, such as a gas 

shock cooler (9) and units for gas purification and heat 
recovery (10) as excess gas extractor (11).
