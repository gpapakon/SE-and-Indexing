<ABSTRACT>
Device for measuring the temperature of an elongated object (10) moved along a movement line, in particular of a running thread (10), the object being able to pass through a measuring chamber (11) held at an essentially constant reference temperature, a sensor surface being arranged in the said measuring chamber in such a way that a transfer of heat between sensor surface and object (10) can take place, and an output signal proportional to the transfer of heat being able to be formed, at least two opposite sensor surfaces (6, 7) being present, according to the invention, in the measuring chamber (11), between which sensor surfaces the object (10) passes. The two sensor surfaces (6, 7) are preferably arranged and configured symmetrically with respect to the movement line of the object (10). In this arrangement, the two sensor surfaces (6, 7) have, in a first direction at right angles to the movement line and at right angles to their separation, an extension which is larger than the deviation, permissible as a whole in this first direction, of the object (10) from the movement line. In addition, the sensor surfaces (6, 7) have a separation from each other and in a second direction at right angles to the movement line, which separation is slightly greater than the deviation, permissible as a whole in this second direction, of the object (10) from the movement line.
