<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of new derivatives of 3-isothiazolones, their 
preparation, and their use in controlling living organisms. 3-Isothiazolones have generated high commercial interest as microbicides to prevent 
spoilage caused by microorganisms in a large number of aqueous and non-aqueous products 
subject to such spoilage. 3-Isothiazolones are highly effective microbicides (as used herein, 
"microbicides" includes bactericides, fungicides, and algaecides and microbicidal activity is 
intended to include both the elimination of and inhibition or prevention of growth of 
microbial organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae) and are useful in a broad range of 
applications. Lewis et al., US 3,761,488; 3,544,580; 3,835,150; 3,706,757; 3,755,224; and 4,105,431, all 
assigned to Rohm and Haas Co., the same assignee as the present invention, disclose 3-isothiazolone 
compounds. US 3,835,150 to Lewis, also assigned to Rohm and Haas Co., discloses certain acrylic 
isothiazolonyl derivatives. Lewis discloses the reaction of certain 3-hydroxyisothiazoles with 
acetylenic compounds, such as methyl propiolate, propiolnitrile, N,N-dimethylpropiolamide, 
and propiolic acid in the presence of a base catalyst such as triethyl 
amine or a quaternary ammonium hydroxide. While this patent discloses other potential 
reactions, only a few specific products are provided. Compound A below (compound 16 
disclosed in US 3875150 at Table I), as well as the other possible products listed in Example 22 
of the '150 patent, result from the reaction occurring at the oxygen, not at the nitrogen of the 
3-hydroxyisothiazoles. 
Lewis '150 further discloses the reactions of certain active halogen compounds with 3-hydroxyisothiazoles. 
Of particular note are the reactions of β-haloacrylates, β-haloacrylamides, 
and β-haloacrylonitrile with 3-hydroxyisothiazoles to yield compounds of 
structure B below, wherein X is halogen and Z is alkoxy, amino or nitrile. The compounds 
exemplified in this patent show reaction at the oxygen only; no compounds corresponding to 
reaction at the nitrogen of the 3-hydroxyisothiazoles are reported. 
US 4,105,431 to Lewis, also assigned to Rohm and Haas Co., discloses reacting vinyl 
acetate with a 3-hydroxyisothiazole to give a vinyl substituted isothiazolone, compound C 
below. The patent further discloses that mercuric salts can be advantageously used to catalyze 
the reaction.  Also disclosed in this patent is the reaction of 3-hydroxyisothiazole with an appropriate 
haloalkene or
