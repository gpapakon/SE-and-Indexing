<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic binder for concrete or mortar contains commercially available cement, such as flying ash cement or slag cement, and possibly additives, as well as fine concrete and/or fine clinker. For preparing concrete or mortar to be formed by a wet-injection process, in particular concrete for tunnels, the binder contains at least 5 % by weight fine cement, and for preparing concrete or mortar to be formed by a dry injection process, in particular concrete for tunnels, it contains at least 5 % by weight fine clinker. The fine cement and the fine clinker have a specific surface area higher than 12,000 cm
