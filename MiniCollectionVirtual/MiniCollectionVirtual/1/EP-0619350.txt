<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink, in
particular, an ink suitable for use in ink-jet recording,
a recording method making use of such an ink.An ink-jet recording system is a method in which
recording is conducted by flying out droplets of an ink to
apply the droplets to a recording material such as paper.
In particular, according to the methods disclosed in
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 61-59911, 61-59912 and
61-59914 by the present applicant, in which an
electrothermal converter is used as an ejection-energy
supply means to apply thermal energy to an ink so as to
generate bubbles, thereby ejecting out droplets of the
ink, formation of a high-density multi-orifice in a
recording head can be realized with ease, and high-resolution
and high-quality images can be recorded at high
speed.Of image-forming processes according to such an
ink-jet recording system, a technique which has especially 
acquired an importance in recent years is an image-forming
process which permits highly fine, full-color recording,
which is good in coloring and free of any feathering or
bleeding, even on non-coated paper such as paper for
electrophotography, paper for reporting, notepaper, letter
paper, bond paper and continuous business forms (these
will hereinafter be called "plain paper" collectively),
which are commonly used in offices and homes. The design
of ink is one of important points for achieving such a
technique.However, the conventional inks used in ink-jet
recording generally comprise, as a principal component,
water, and include additionally a water-soluble high
boiling solvent such as glycol for the purpose of
preventing drying and clogging, and the like. When such
an ink has been used to conduct recording on plain paper,
there have been disadvantages that the ink penetrates into
the interior of the recording paper, resulting in failure
to obtain images having sufficient color depth, and
moreover, unevenness of color strength occurs on images,
which appears to be attributed to the uneven distribution
of the filler and size on the surface of the recording
paper. In particular, when a color image is intended to
form, plural inks of different colors are overlapped one
after another before the time required to fix the inks
goes on. Therefore, color bleeding and uneven color 
mixing have occurred at portions of boundaries between
different colors in the resulting image (hereinafter
referred to as "bleeding" simply), resulting in failure to
obtain a satisfactory image.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.

an ink are ejected out from an orifice in accordance with

a recording signal to make a record on a recording 
material, wherein said ink used is the ink according to

any one of Claims 1 to 6.

to 6 in a recording unit comprising an ink container

portion with an ink held therein and a head from which the
ink is ejected in the form of ink droplets, wherein said

ink is the ink according to any one of Claims 1 to 6.
The use of the ink according to any one of claims 1
to 6 in an ink-jet recording apparatus comprising a

recording head from which an ink is ejected in the form of
ink droplets, an ink cartridge having an ink container

portion with the ink held therein, and an ink feeder for
feeding the ink from the ink cartridge to the recording

head, wherein said ink is the ink according to any one of
Claims 1 to 6.
The use according to claim 9 or 10, wherein the head
comprises a head in which thermal energy is applied to

the ink to eject its droplets.
