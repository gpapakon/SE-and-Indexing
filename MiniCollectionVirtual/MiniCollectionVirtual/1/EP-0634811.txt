<ABSTRACT>
A shear bolt screw (10) having a threaded body (14) with an external thread (16) as well as a tear-off head (12) having an engagement surface for a tool. A transitional region (20) is located between the threaded body (14) and the tear-off head (12). This transitional region (20) has a smaller external diameter than the threaded body (14) and the tear-off head (12). The transitional region (20) tapers from the tear-off head (12) to the threaded body (14) in an increasing manner, and ends in a shear groove (22) running in the circumferential direction. The latter is located deeper than the upper end (30) of the threaded body (14) facing the tear-off head (12). The fracture surface which is produced in the region of the shear groove (22) thus does not present any problems during further handling.
