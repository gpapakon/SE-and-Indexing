<ABSTRACT>
A conduit comprised of double-wall pipes A is laid in the 
ground by the pipe-jacking method. Each of double-wall pipes A 

comprises inner pipe 1 and outer pipe 2 and is provided with 
sheath pipe 3 between inner pipe 1 and outer pipe 2 and with 

check valve 4. Winch 7 is mounted in tunneling machine 6. Wire 8 
wound on winch 7 is inserted into sheath pipe 3 and the forward 

end of wire 8 is sent to start vertical shaft C through sheath 
pipe 3, and connected with cleaning member 21, injecting member 

F, and lubricant or back-filling supply pipe 11. Cleaning member 
21, injecting member F, and lubricant or back-filling material 

supply pipe 11 are moved in sheath pipes 3 by driving winch 7. 
When injecting member F is opposed to check valve 4, packing 

means 16, 17 are inflated to be brought into contact with the 
inside of sheath pipe 3 by which injecting member F is fixed to 

sheath pipe 3. Lubricant or back-filling material is sent to a 
space between packing means in sheath pipe 3, and injected 

through check valve 4 into space 5 between the outside of outer 
pipe 2 and the ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of injecting 
lubricant or back-filling material into a space between the 
outside of double-wall pipes and the ground in laying a conduit 
comprised of double-wall pipes each of which comprises an inner 
pipe and an outer pipe, by supplying lubricant or back-filling 
material to a check valve mounted in an outer pipe of a 
double-wall pipe, through a lubricant or back-filling material 
supply pipe introduced through sheath pipes each of which is 
provided between an inner pipe and an outer pipe of each 
double-wall pipe, and injecting lubricant or back-filling 
material into a space between the outside of double-wall pipes 
and the ground through the check valve, while laying a conduit in 
the ground, and to 
an apparatus for 
injecting lubricant or back-filling material into a space between 
the outside of double wall pipes and the ground. Laying sewer conduit or service water conduit in the ground 
is carried out by tunneling through the ground by a tunneling 
machine, while the tunneling machine followed by pipes such as 
Hume pipes and steel pipes is propelled by a pipe-jacking 
machine, wherein it is carried out to inject lubricant into a 
space between the outside of the tunneling machine and the ground 
and between the outside of pipes and the ground. Further, in the 
above-mentioned pipe-jacking method, it is also carried out to 
inject back-filling material into a space between the outside of 
pipes forming a conduit and the ground, after having laying the 
conduit. Each of pipes with diameter over 800mm used in the 
above-mentioned pipe-jacking method is formed with a hole at a 
given position. The hole is connected through a hose with a 
lubricant or back-filling material feeder, which is provided on 
the ground. While propelling pipes, lubricant is injected into a 
space between the outside of pipes and the ground, by supplying 
lubricant through the hose to the hole and injecting lubricant to 
the space through the hole so that frictional force can be 
decreased, or after having laid a desired conduit in the ground, 
back-filling material is injected into a space between the 
outside of pipes and the ground so that the space between the 
outside of pipes and the ground is filled with back-filling 
material. On the other hand, there is a case where a conduit for 
supplying gas such as coal gas or fuel gas and natural gas and 
others is laid in the ground. Since a gas pipe requires the 
higher gastightness, gas pipes are connected with each other by

A method of injecting lubricant or back-filling material 
into a space between the outside of double-wall pipes (A) and the 

ground in laying a conduit comprised of double-wall pipes in the 
ground by the pipe-ja
cking method, each of said double-wall pipes (A) 
comprising an inner pipe (1) and an outer pipe (2) and being provided 

with a sheath pipe (3) into which a lubricant or back-filling 
material supply pipe (11) is inserted, between the inner pipe and the 

outer pipe and with a check valve (4) through which lubricant or 
back-filling material is injected into a space (5) between the 

outside of the double-wall pipes and the ground in the outer
