<ABSTRACT>
A pallet system includes a modular base element providing a horizontal supporting surface (17) and, at each corner, an array of vertical sockets (6, 7, 8) and a plurality of modular side elements having uprights (20, 21) arranged to mate with the sockets of the base element in order to stand vertically at a horizontal edge of the latter, the side elements being capable of being assembled with the base in either of two relatively horizontally displaced positions in one of which a vertical edge (24) thereof can engage and locate an upright (20) of a similar element assembled to an adjacent horizontal edge of the same base element, to form a corner, and in the other of which the vertical edge (24) can engage and locate an upright (20) of a similar element assembled to an adjacent horizontal edge of another base element mating with the first, to form an extended coplanar vertical wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a pallet, and more particularly a 
pallet of the kind comprising a pallet base providing a 
supporting surface with an entry space therebelow to receive 
the fork of a fork lift truck, and side members that are 
attachable to the base to enclose goods supported thereon and 
to allow loaded pallets to be stacked one above the other (see 
DD-A-248 098). 
It is an object of the invention to provide a pallet system 
comprising base and sides that are of modular construction 
enabling simplified assembly of the pallet from few standard 
parts. Further preferred objects of the invention, not necessarily in 
order of importance, are as follows: 
1. The pallet should provide for two way, or optionally 
four way, entry. 2. Two pallet bases should couple together to form a 
double pallet, when required. 3. The pallets should be capable of being stacked at 
least two high when assembled and loaded, either singly 
or when coupled in pairs. 4. The modular system should be inherently incapable of 
being assembled with more than two pallet bases linked 
together. 5. The side members should optionally enclose either 
two opposite sides, or both sides and ends, of a single 
or double pallet base. 6. The modular pallet system should comprise only two 
different components, namely the pallet base and a 
standard side member. According to one aspect of the invention, a pallet system 
comprises a pallet base providing a horizontal supporting 
surface of generally rectangular, preferably square, outline 
and having an array of vertically aligned connecting means at 
each corner, and a plurality of side members each including a  
 
pair of uprights arranged to mate with corresponding 
connecting means of said arrays at two corners of the base, 
one upright of each pair including locating means for 
embracing the other upright of another side member in order to 
maintain relative alignment of the uprights in a horizontal 
direction. According to another aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a pallet system including a modular base element 
providing a horizontal supporting surface and arranged to mate 
with a similar element at one horizontal edge, by 
interengagement along a horizontal axis, and a modular side 
element arranged to mate with the base element in order to 
stand vertically at a horizontal edge thereof, the side 
element being capable of being assembled with the base in 
either of two relatively horizontally displaced positions in 
one of which a vertical edge thereof can engage and

A pallet system comprising a base element providing a 
horizontal supporting surface of generally rectangular, 

preferably square, outline and having an array of vertically 
aligned connecting means (6, 7, 8) at each corner, and a plurality of 

side elements each including a pair of uprights (20, 21) arranged to 
mate with corresponding connecting means of said arrays at two 

corners of the base element, one upright of each pair 
including locating means (24) for embracing the other upright of 

another side element in order to maintain relative alignment 
of the uprights in a horizontal direction. 
A pallet system including a modular base element 
providing a horizontal supporting surface and arranged to mate 

with a similar element at one horizontal edge, by 
interengagement (15, 16) along a horizontal axis, and a modular side 

element arranged to mate with the base element in order to 
stand vertically at a horizontal edge thereof, the side 

element being capable of being assembled with the base in 
either of two relatively horizontally displaced positions in 

one of which a vertical edge thereof can engage and locate a 
corresponding vertical edge of a similar element assembled to 

an adjacent horizontal edge of the same base element, to form 
a corner, and in the other of which a vertical edge thereof 

can engage and locate a corresponding vertical edge of a 
similar element assembled to an adjacent horizontal edge of 

another base element mating with the first, to form an 
extended coplanar vertical wall. 
A pallet system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
said base element has in the region of each corner an array of 

vertically aligned connecting means including a first 
connecting means (7) arranged at the extremity of the corner and 

second and third connecting means (6, 8) respectively on each side of 
the corner adjacent the first connecting means, and wherein  

 
the or each side element has two uprights (20, 21) arranged for 

engagement with connecting means at two adjacent corners of 
the base element, said two uprights being so spaced that with 

one upright (20) engaged in a first connecting means (7) at one corner 
of the base the other upright (21) engages with that one of the 

second and third connecting means at the other corner which is 
in horizontal alignment with the respective edge of the 

pallet. 
A pallet system according to claim 1 or 3, wherein said 
base element and the or each side element have a framework 

formed of steel section, the said connecting means comprising 
sections that are vertically aligned to form sockets and the 

said uprights comprising frame members that are extended to 
form complementary spigots. 
A pallet system according to claim 4, wherein one of said 
frame members of the or each side element has attached thereto 

a bracket of L-section defining a recess for embracing the 
other frame member of a similar side element assembled 

adjacent thereto. 
A pallet system as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein the 
framework of the base element incorporates horizontally 

extending spigot and socket means (15, 16) for engagement with like 
means of another identical element to maintain alignment of 

two such elements in a common horizontal plane when assembled 
together. 
A pallet system as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6, 
wherein the frame of the base element is provided with a load 

bearing cover panel (17) that is arranged to rest thereon and to be 
located between upper extremities of said connecting means.
