<ABSTRACT>
A device for preventing or reducing the incidence 
or intensity of pain occurring in a region of the body 

of a wearer, said device comprising insulating material 

(2) which is arranged to be worn in conformity and close 
proximity with the body region, said insulating material 

having at least one layer (14) for reducing heat loss 
from the body region by convection and at least one 

reflective layer (13) for reducing heat loss from the 
body by radiation, whereby a targeted local warming 

effect is achieved in said body region such that the 
skin and underlying musculoskeletal structures are in 

such an active state that they can function properly to 
provide a clinical benefit to the body region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for preventing or
reducing the incidence or intensity of pain occurring in
the body, for example in the neck, back (high-back or
mid-back or low-back) or in the joints of a wearer.In the past various devices and techniques have been
used with the aim of treating body pain, for example in
the back. Conventionally such devices are belts or
collars which have mechanical support to resist movement
of the neck or back. These devices may be made from a
mechanically reinforced fabric which is distributed
within the entire collar or belt. These collars and
belts are generally also porous allowing aeration and
heat passage.Heat or cold has been thought to have a pain reducing
effect. For example, in self-care, heat is a widely
used method as can be seen with electric pads, hot water
bottles, hot baths and saunas.Several devices exist on the market for applying heat to
the back. These include hot water bottles, hot pads
powered by electricity or chemical reactions.They have the disadvantages that (a) an external source
of heat is required for application to the back for pain
relief; (b) they do not have any specific thermal
insulating capacity and the heat remains only for a
limited period of time; and (c) they are heavy, bulky
and cumbersome.Instead of using an external source of heat it is also 
known to keep the whole body warm simply by wearing
clothes, coats or blankets. Various fabrics have been
used from wool to synthetic materials such as acrylics
and hollow fibres. Conventionally they cover a large
portion of the body and the thermal characteristics of
the worn articles are generally ill-defined and a
targeted, local warming effect is not achieved.There have also been many efforts aimed at achieving a
targeted local warming effect (GB-A-873,575, GB-A-1,038,043,
FR-A-2,617,707). The materials used have low
insulating characteristics or their insulating
characteristics are ill-defined.FR-A-2 648 343 discloses a thermal sheet having an insulating layer and a reflective layer.There have also been efforts to achieve both insulation
and mechanical support. GB-A-1,347,554 and EP-A-0,019,822
are examples of such attempts. In those
disclosures heat is applied externally (not provided by
the body itself). In both of these documents, the
source is electrostatic friction of the clothing
materials between themselves and the body of the wearer.However none of the above described arrangements is
likely to be clinically effective as the materials
suggested by the documents have an

<CLAIMS>
A device (2) for preventing or reducing the incidence
or intensity of pain occurring in a region of the body

of a wearer, said device comprising insulating material (14;15)
which is arranged to be worn in conformity and close

proximity with the body region, said insulating material
having means (14;15) for reducing heat loss from the body region

by convection and reflective means (13;15) for reducing heat
loss from the body by radiation, whereby a targeted reduction

in heat loss from said body region is achieved
such that the skin and underlying musculoskeletal

structures are kept in an active state such that they can
function properly to provide a clinical benefit to the

body region, characterised in that the insulating material (14;15) is porous so as
to allow the passage of water vapour therethrough.
A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
insulating material (14;15) has a thermal conductivity of less

than 0.35 cm/TOG or 0.035 Watt/mÂ°C.
A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
the insulating material (14;15) has a density of less than 12

kg/cubic metre.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the device (2) is less than 2.0cm thick.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
the insulating material is a random

metallised plastic fibre matrix (15).
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the insulating material comprises at least one

perforated reflective layer (13) such as an aluminised
plastic or fabric film.
A device as claimed in claim 6, wherein a plurality 
of perforated reflective layers (13) and at least one

insulation layer (14) are provided, with a said relective
layer being arranged at closest proximity to the wearer.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
elasticated or stretchable materials (7) are used to ensure

that the insulating material (14;15) is in conformity and close
proximity to the body.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
a mechanical support (1) is provided in the form of strips

or bands aligned parallel to the main axis of the body
region or criss-crossing the main axis of the body

region.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
spacers (16) are provided to maintain the insulating material (14;15)

at a minimum thickness upon stretching or compression to
thereby maintain insulation efficiency.
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said device (2) is in the form of a belt for

treating the back, a collar for treating the posterior
neck, or modified underwear or a sports garment

incorporating the insulating material against the
relevant body part such as the upper and mid-thoracic

back, or a device to be worn around a joint such as the
knee, elbow or ankle.
