<ABSTRACT>
The burner comprises a tap-hole block (1), a burner body (C) constituted essentially by a tubular element (2), at least one injection pipe (3) extending in the burner body as far as into the cavity (P) of the tap-hole block (1), and unlockable rapid mounting means (22, 20, 16, 23; 26, 28) for the injection pipe (3) on the tubular element (2) and for the tubular element (2) on the tap-hole block (1). Application in particular to oxycombustion in glass furnaces.

Oxyfuel burner comprising a burner body (C)
and a tap-hole block (1) made of refractory material

defining a cavity (P) having a cylindrical upstream
portion (7) which is connected to a downstream portion

(8) of enlarged cross section, the said burner
comprising a tubular element (2) in which an internal

injection pipe (3) for injecting fuel is placed
coaxially, the oxidant gas being injected into the

tubular element (2), characterized in that the
downstream portion (13) of the tubular element (2) is

housed in the upstream end of the upstream portion (7)
of the tap-hole block (1), in that the injection tube

(3) is fastened at its downstream end to bracing and
centring means (34), the length of the injection pipe

(3) being defined so that its downstream end (33) lies
beyond the end of the downstream portion (13) of the

tubular element (2), the bracing and centring means
(34) engaging with the inner wall of the upstream

portion (7) of the cavity (P) and ensuring that the
pipe (3) is centred in the passage (P), in that it

includes first means for quickly mounting a supporting
structure (23) on the tubular element (2), this

supporting structure being fastened to a first end of
the internal injection pipe (3), the said supporting

structure (23) including means for handling the
injection pipe (3) and in that it includes a rear cap

(24) forming a feed chamber for the injection pipe,
comprising means (25) for
 connection to a fluid circuit 
and a portion (26) of the first quick mounting means

(28).
Burner according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the supporting structure includes a plate (23)

which is penetrated by the injection pipe (3) and is
intended to be mounted on an annular flange (7) at the

rear end of the tubular element (2) of the burner body
(C).
Burner according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it includes at least two

parallel injection pipes (3).
Burner according to Claim (3), characterized
in that it includes second spacing means (41) between

the second ends of the injection pipes (3).
Burner according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the second end of the injection

pipe (3) consists of an attached metal nozzle (42).
Burner according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it comprises a first

reinforcement mounted around the tubular element (2), a
second reinforcement (9) fastened to the tap-hole block

(1), and second quick mounting means (20) between the
first and second reinforcements.
Burner according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the second mounting means comprise at least one

swinging threaded tie rod (20).
Burner according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the injection pipe (3)

projects axially from the tubular element (2).
Use of a burner according to one of the
preceding claims in a glass furnace.
Use according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the burner body (C) is fed with a gaseous oxidant

containing at least 90 % of oxygen.
Use according to Claim 10, characterized in
that the gaseous oxidant is provided by an air

separation unit (50) operating by adsorption.
