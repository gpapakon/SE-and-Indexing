<ABSTRACT>
In a simultaneous voice and data communication system, a stream of 
signal points is partitioned into a plurality of symbol blocks, each symbol block 

including a data segment and a control segment. The data segment carries 
information from a user, i.e., user data, while the control segment provides control 

information. A voice signal is then added to at least a portion, or all, of the signal 
points of each symbol block to provide for simultaneous voice and data transmission 

to an opposite endpoint. The control information may represent information from a 
secondary data source, and/or may include information about the characteristics of 

the succeeding block, e.g., the user data rate, and information pertaining to 
characteristics of the communications channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data communications equipment and, 
more particularly, to the use of a side-channel in a simultaneous voice and data 
communications system. The co-pending, commonly assigned, U.S. Patent application of Gordon 
Bremer and Kenneth D. Ko entitled "Simultaneous Analog and Digital 
Communication," serial No. 08/076505, filed on June 14, 1993, describes a 
simultaneous voice and data communications system in which a voice signal is 
added to a data signal for transmission over a communications channel to a receiving 
modem. In this simultaneous analog and digital communication system, the data 
signal to be transmitted is represented by a sequence of data symbols, where each 
data symbol is associated with a particular N-dimensional signal point value taken 
from a signal space. Similarly, the analog signal, which is represented by a voice 
signal, is processed so that it is mapped into the N-dimensional signal space to 
provide a voice signal point. This voice signal point defines the magnitude and angle 
of a voice signal vector about the origin of the signal space. The data symbol and 
the voice signal vector are then added together to select a resultant N-dimensional 
signal point, which is then transmitted to a far-end modem. Upon reception of the transmitted N-dimensional signal point, the 
receiver of the far-end modem detects the embedded data symbol and subtracts the 
data symbol from the received N-dimensional signal point to yield the voice signal 
vector. This voice signal vector is then used to recreate the voice signal. Using this above-mentioned technique to simultaneously transmit voice 
and data, there is sometimes a need to transmit additional information separate and 
apart from the voice and data information. For example, the co-pending, commonly 
assigned, U.S. Patent application of Gordon Bremer, Kenneth D. Ko, Luke J. 
Smithwick, and Edward S. Zuranski, entitled "Autorate Method for Simultaneous 
Transmission of Voice and Data," serial No. 08/076525, filed on June 21, 1993, 
describes that a "silence indicator" message can be additionally transmitted on a 
secondary, or side-channel, as is known in the art, where this side-channel is separate 
and apart from the simultaneous voice and data transmission.  In accordance with the invention, we have realized an advantageous 
side-channel technique wherein the side-channel is multiplexed with the data signal, 
and the resultant multiplexed signal is then added to the analog, e.g., voice, signal to 
provide
