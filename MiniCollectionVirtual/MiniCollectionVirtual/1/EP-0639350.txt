<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism and applier therefor which is capable of 
inverted anastomosis of two lumens by an absorbable 

fastener. The fastener is made from two washer-like plate 
assemblies (20,30) and a pair of introducers. Each such plate 

assembly has slots to receive latching prongs (24) protruding 
from the other plate, and pins (29,39) to impale tissue. 

Fastening is done through an applier that causes the pins 
to pierce the tissue, and causes a knife blade to cut 

through excess tissue. Fastening is done by attaching 
fastener halves. Insertion and removal of the fastener 

and applier optimally is done in an endoscopic procedure 
through a trocar or through the surgical incision in an 

open procedure. The system can be used such that the 
plates can be placed to properly set gaps between and 

anastomose tissue. The introducer portion will soften 
intraluminally and be expelled, in about 24 hours. The 

coupler portion will remain in place for 2-3 weeks, 
typically, and then fragment and be expelled with the 

feces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an applier for emplacement of absorbable
or biodegradable mechanical couplers for circular anastomotic
fastening of tubular organs.Currently, there exist a number of surgical anastomotic
circular staplers. Generally, these staplers are used to
perform an inverted connection of severed tissue with a
circular ring of staples displayed around a circumference
to connect the tissue. An inverted connection is one
where serosa is joined to serosa. In some instances, to
maximize the inside diameter of the lumen, a knife
mechanism is used to cut the excess tissue within the
circumference of the staple ring. The ring of staples is
generally a number of small metallic surgical staples,
usually between 20 and 40 staples, which form a ring
roughly 2 cm to 4 cm in diameter. Naturally, with the
inverted connection and with the circular rows of staples
there will be some constriction of the tissue during and
after healing. Ideally, the lumen diameter at the
anastomotic site must be maintained as near as possible to
that of the normal healthy bowel, prior to the procedure,
to allow normal passage of semisolid materials.With this type of anastomosis, to prevent infection and
abscess, there must be a complete 360Â° seal of tissue so
that no gaps exist between the connected tissue. In 
addition, it is naturally desirable that when the tissue
is connected, the interior volume of the lumen within
which the tissue is cut be maintained so that resectioned
vessel tissue is continually able to pass fluids while
encountering only a minimum of constricting tissue.In addition, with such circular anastomotic devices it is
often desirable to make applier tools which are
disposable. That is, disposable instruments are now well
accepted by surgeons. Disposable surgical staplers and
the like also help prevent the spreading of bacteria or
germs. Naturally, the surgeon also desires an instrument
which gives good-off-the-shelf reliability and allows a
controlled one-handed operation. If necessary to meet the
above criteria, it should be possible to construct this
device applier to meet disposable needs.It is also desirable to replace a standard staple line
with two adaptively connectable couplers or fasteners. In
this way, the need for bending of staples is removed, and
yet closure and hemostasis are possible. Of course, by
attempting to formulate a system in which a standard
staple line is replaced, it would be desirable to
formulate such a stapler so that the stapler itself can be
pulled through the attached part

<CLAIMS>
An applier (10) for emplacement of an anastomotic
coupler mechanism (20, 30) having a hollow tubular interior

comprising;

a tubular shaft (14) with proximal and distal ends and
defining an axis for placement within said hollow

interior;
a retaining mechanism (12) at said distal end having a
first position for holding said shaft (14) to said hollow

tubular interior; and
an activating mechanism (17) located at said shaft
proximal end, capable of activating said retaining

mechanism (12) to cause said retaining mechanism (12) to move from
its first position to a second position wherein said

coupler may be released from said shaft (14);

characterised in that the tubular shaft (14) is hollow and contains
openings at both said proximal and distal ends by means of which suction

can be applied to the tubular shaft (14) to assist in the manipulation
of the tubular organ and to secure said tubular organ to said coupler

mechanism (20, 30).
The applier (10) of claim 1 wherein said retaining
mechanism (12) comprises a pair of friction members capable of

movement in a direction transverse to said shaft (14).
The applier (10) of claim 1 wherein said retaining
mechanism (12) is capable of holding said hollow interior of

said coupler in a friction fit.
The applier (10) of claim 1 wherein said actuator
mechanism (17) is a push button means which is connected to

said retaining mechanism (12), and said push button means
capable of causing said retaining mechanism (12) to move from

said first position transverse to said shaft (14) to said
second position. 
The applier (10) of claim 1 further comprising knife
means (19) at said distal end, said knife means (19) activated by

said activating mechanism (17) so that said knife means (19) moves
along said shaft axis.
The applier (10) of claim 6 wherein said knife means (19)
is activated to move distally along said shaft (14).
