<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a single-chain Fv (sFv) polypeptide defining a binding site which exhibits the immunological binding properties of an immunoglobulin molecule which binds c-erbB-2 or a c-erbB-2-related tumor antigen, the sFv includes at least two polypeptide domains connected by a polypeptide linker spanning the distance between the C-terminus of one domain and the N-terminus of the other, the amino acid sequence of each of the polypeptide domains includes a set of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) interposed  between a set of framework regions (FRs), the CDRs conferring immunological binding to the c-erbB-2 or c-erbB-2-related tumor antigen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to novel
biosynthetic compositions of matter and, specifically,
to biosynthetic antibody binding site (BABS) proteins,
and conjugates thereof. Compositions of the invention
are useful, for example, in drug and toxin targeting,
imaging, immunological treatment of various cancers,
and in specific binding assays, affinity purification
schemes, and biocatalysis.Carcinoma of the breast is the most common
malignancy among women in North America, with 130,000
new cases in 1987. Approximately one in 11 women
develop breast cancer in their lifetimes, causing this
malignancy to be the second leading cause of cancer
death among women in the United States, after lung
cancer. Although the majority of women with breast
cancer present with completely resectable disease,
metastatic disease remains a formidable obstacle to
cure. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal
therapy has definite positive impact on disease-free
survival and overall survival in selected subsets of
women with completely resected primary breast cancer,
but a substantial proportion of women still relapse
with metastatic disease (see, e.g., Fisher et al.
(1986) J. Clin. Oncol. 4:929-941; "The Scottish trial",
Lancet (1987) 2:171-175). In spite of the regularly
induced objective responses induced by chemotherapy and
hormonal therapy in appropriately selected patients,
cure of metastatic breast cancer has not been achieved
(see e.g., Aisner, et al. (187) J. Clin. Oncol. 
5:1523-1533). To this end, many innovative treatment
programs including the use of new agents, combinations
of agents, high dose therapy (Henderson, ibid.) and
increased dose intensity (Kernan et al. (1988) Clin.
Invest. 259:3154-3157) have been assembled. Although
improvements have been observed, routine achievement of
complete remissions of metastatic disease, the first
step toward cure, has not occurred. There remains a
pressing need for new approaches to treatment.The Fv fragment of an immunoglobulin molecule
from IgM, and on rare occasions IgG or IgA, is produced
by proteolytic cleavage and includes a non-covalent VH-VL
heterodimer representing an intact antigen binding
site. A single chain Fv (sFv) polypeptide is a
covalently linked VH-VL heterodimer which is expressed
from a gene fusion including VH- and VL-encoding genes
connected by a peptide-encoding linker. See Huston et
al., 1988, Proc. Nat. Aca. Sci. 85: 5879, hereby
incorporated by reference.U.S. Patent 4,753,894 discloses murine monoclonal
antibodies which bind selectively to human
