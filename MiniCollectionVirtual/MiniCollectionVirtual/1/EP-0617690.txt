<ABSTRACT>
A drive is disclosed for a rotating drum useful as a collecting container on refuse collection vehicles, composting drums or the like. The drum has a closed front side with a centrally arranged bearing journal and is rotatably mounted at its opposite, open end by means of a large ball bearing. The inner or outer ring of the large ball bearing is linked to the drum and the open end of the drum may be closed by a lid that can swivel upwards, held on the drum so as to turn therewith, and provided on a truncated cone with a guiding or compacting plate. The large ball bearing has lower and upper bearing supports for supporting the closing lid, its opening cylinder bearing and lid locking arrangement. The lower bearing support (21) is secured by a bolt to the auxiliary frame (3) and the drum (4) is secured by means of driving segments (30, 31, 32) that describe a circular movement, whose length represents a fraction of the circumference of the drum and that engage in the area of a defined circular arc section (b), in a phased manner, the preferably extended roller chain ring (10) at the circumference of the drum. The reference circle of the driving segments (30, 31, 32) is larger than the reference circle of the roller chain ring, toothed wheel (10) or the like to be driven. In a preferred embodiment, the driving unit (16) is mounted on a lower bearing support (21) and is radially adjustable. This driving concept has the advantage of smoothly applying the force required for driving the drum in the area of a circular arc section of the circumference of the drum, so that the bearing and driving elements are less stressed. A simpler, weight-saving embodiment of the rear-side bearing construction and a low-noise drum drive can thus be achieved.
