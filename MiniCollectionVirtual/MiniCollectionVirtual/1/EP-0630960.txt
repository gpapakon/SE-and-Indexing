A lubricating oil composition is herein disclosed 
which comprises (a) a base oil comprising a mineral oil, a 

synthetic oil or both the oils, (b) a copolymer having 
repeating units of the formulae (I) and (II)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil
composition. More particularly, it relates to a lubricating
oil composition which is excellent in frictional characteristics
and stability against oxidation, inhibits its
change with the lapse of time, and is effectively utilizable
as a lubricating oil for various kinds of equipments
such as an automatic transmission, a continuously variable
transmission, a gear of a tractor, a wet brake, a wet
clutch and a power steering.A lubricating oil which can be used to lubricate an
automatic transmission, a continuously variable transmission,
a gear of a tractor, a wet brake, a wet clutch, a
power steering or the like is required to have good properties
of frictional characteristics, oxidation stability,
corrosion resistance, rust resistance and the like. Especially
important requirements are that a ratio of a coefficient
of static friction to a coefficient of kinematic
friction by which the frictional characteristics are indicated
is small and that a change in this ratio with the
lapse of time is small.Heretofore, as such a lubricating oil, there is
known a lubricating oil having a high coefficient of static
friction and good transmission torque. This kind of lubricating 
oil, however, is disadvantageous in that the frictional
characteristics are not sufficiently satisfactory
and a shift shock is large.In recent years, with the miniaturization of cars
and the abrupt increase in FF cars (front engine front
wheel driven cars), the tendency of miniaturizing the
automatic transmission and the like more and more increases.
Such a miniaturization of the automatic transmission
inconveniently makes a driver feel the shift shock more
sensitively. Thus, in order to relieve the shift shock and
to thereby make a car more comfortable to drive, it has
been a technical subject to improve the frictional characteristics
especially at an initial stage.For the purpose of improving the frictional characteristics
at the initial stage, there have been suggested a
lubricating oil containing a friction modifier (Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 173097/1985 and
180000/1988) and a lubricating oil in which a base oil
having a specific composition is used (Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open No. 254196/1988). In these lubricating
oils, however, the change with the lapse time in the
frictional characteristics is large, and so they are not
considered to have a sufficient performance.The present invention intends to overcome the above-mentioned
problems of conventional
