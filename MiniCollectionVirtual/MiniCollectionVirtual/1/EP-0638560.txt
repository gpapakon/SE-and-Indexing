<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a therapeutic agent for 
osteoporosis containing, as an active ingredient, a certain 
azepine compound having superior bone resorption-inhibitory 
activity, a novel diazepine compound, a method for treating 
osteoporosis and use of said compound. The osteoporosis is a syndrome which develops a symptom 
wherein a bone mass per unit volume is unusually decreased 
without causing any change in the chemical composition (ratio 
between organic substance and mineral substance) of the ossein 
per se and physiologically characterized by a decrease in 
protein, calcium and phosphorus in the bone. The decrease in bone mass as a symptom includes that caused 
by physiological aging. Accordingly, the definition of the 
disease will be a remarkable decrease in bone mass which is 
greater than that caused by the physiological aging and the 
manifestation of clinical symptoms such as dorsolumbar pain, 
pathologic fracture, vertebral deformation and the like. The osteoporosis proceeds with aging and generally damages 
vertebra and causes dorsolumbar pain and shortening of the 
height. In a very advanced case, long bone is also damaged to 
sometimes cause fracture. The femoral fractures seen in old 
people are said to be mostly due to senile osteoporosis.  The causes of the osteoporosis are diverse and include 
abnormal internal secretion inclusive of menopause, nutritional 
disorder and so on. The vitamin D preparations, calcium 
preparations, calcitonin preparations, bisphosphonate 
preparations and so on conventionally used for treating 
osteoporosis suffer from limitation on administration targets 
and unconclusive effects. As regards female hormone 
preparations, its dependable effects are associated with severe 
side effects such as genital cancer caused by a long-term use of 
the preparation. Hence, the development of a therapeutic agent for 
osteoporosis, having reliable effects and high safety is 
strongly demanded. In recent years, thionaphthene-2-carboxylic acid derivative 
and 3-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one derivative (isoflavone 
derivative) having a completely different chemical structure 
from the aforementioned preparations have been reported to have 
bone resorption-inhibitory activity and to be useful as 
therapeutic agents for treating osteoporosis (A. J. Johannesson 
et al, Endocrinology, 117, p 1508, EP-A-135172, EP-A-136569, 
EP-A-146921, US Patent No. 4644012). As the derivative having bone resorption-inhibitory 
activity, (cycloalkylamino)methylenebis(phosphonic
