<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotor for steam
turbine to be used in power generation facilities.Conventionally, it has been necessary that members to be
used at high temperatures and under high pressures in thermal
power generation facilities are those whose material
characteristics are excellent as the whole, insusceptible to
too much changes of these material characteristics even after
they are exposed to high temperatures for many hours. As
these members intended for use at high temperatures and under
high pressures, heat resistant high-Cr ferrite based steels
containing 8 to 12 % of Cr have been used, so far. Steels of
this kind are available at comparatively inexpensive prices,
can easily be manufactured and have high values of physical
properties. Thus, they have found their application in wide
industrial segments, doing much to the improvement of the
performance and reliability of facilities operating at high
temperatures and under high pressures.Conventionally, it has been the most important object to
make compatible the high-temperature strength and the 
toughness which are incompatible each other, when high-Cr
ferrite based steels are in development stages. One of the
causes for the decline of toughness is that precipitates are
deposited in crystal grain boundaries. Accordingly, whereas
it has been attempted to prevent this precipitation, fine
precipitates have been caused to separate out uniformly in the
inside of crystal grains from solid solutions having a high
concentration of parent phase, to obtain the high-temperature
strength.Conventional heat resistant high-Cr ferrite based steels
have a problem, however. When the high-Cr ferrite based
steels undergo creeps under stress at temperatures almost as
high as 600°C for a long term, their metal structure is
markedly changed. A greater part of inevitable precipitates
concentrates upon the crystal grain boundaries or martensite
lath boundaries, while the density of precipitates is lowered
in the inside of the martensite lath, together with the
recovering of structure and the growth of subgrains. Thus,
material characteristics of the steels such as impact
resistance are lowered by far, in response to the changes of
the structure described as above. Therefore, reliability of a
thermal power plant may be poor if it comprises a large size
member, a rotor for steam turbine made of conventional heat
resistant high-Cr ferrite based steels and is operated in an
atmosphere of steam at 600°C or higher. On the other hand,
there have been demands for
