<CLAIMS>
Spectacle frame having side-arms (7) which are
connected to a lens-side connection piece (6) so as to be

horizontally pivotable by means of a joint (8), the joint
comprising a basic block (9) and a slide block (10) which

are connected to one another by means of a shank which
has, at one end, a joint ball (11) and, by its other end,

is fixed on the slide block (10) with interposition of a
spring (16), and the basic block (9) having an opening at

its end face directed towards the slide block (10) and a
recess, which lies behind said opening and is designed in

the manner of a joint socket, for receiving the joint
ball (11), and also having a horizontal slot (17) which

extends into the basic block (9) as far as the joint-socket-like
recess and the end-face opening, and in which

the shank (12) is horizontally pivotable as the side-arms
are folded together, characterized in that the end-face

opening has cutouts (18), aligned substantially vertically,
in such a way that the shank (12) can move into

these cutouts (18) in the event of vertical movements of
the side-arm (7).
Spectacle frame according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the basic block (9) has a substantially

V-shaped recess at its end face, and in that the slide
block (10) has a substantially V-shaped tip.
Spectacle frame according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that a receiving depression (19) is

arranged on the basic block (9) for the folded-in state
of the side-arm (7), the shape of which receiving depression

is substantially adapted to the tip of the slide
block (10).
