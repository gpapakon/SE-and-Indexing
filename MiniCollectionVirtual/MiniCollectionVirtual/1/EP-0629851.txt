<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a complex device for absorption-spectroscopy trace-gas analysis, with the aid of which, on the one hand, a laser power supply is possible in effective manner and in the case of which signals obtained after the laser radiation has passed through a measuring cell and a reference cell can be evaluated using widely varied modulation techniques. Furthermore, the invention enables on-line drift correction, without it being necessary to store and subsequently process a multiplicity of raw spectra. In addition, dynamic intensity normalisation is possible and sample and background measurement can be carried out alternately with high temporal resolution non-mechanically.
