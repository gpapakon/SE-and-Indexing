<ABSTRACT>
A well casing (12) is perforated in two or more 
places by lowering a first perforating gun (16) to a 

supported location, and then lowering an additional gun (36) 
to be supported on the first gun (16), and firing the guns. 

One or more additional guns (36,40) can be used, each 
supported on the underlying gun. To support the first gun, 

a gun hanger (24) can be used, or a bridge plug or pipe 
engaging the well bore.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of perforating 
a well. In the past, tubing conveyed perforating systems 
for use in completing wells have been conveyed into the 
wells on a tubing or pipe string with the string left in 
position in the well during the perforating of the well. 
After perforating the well, the perforating guns may have 
disintegrated or may be retrieved, or may be released or 
dropped from the tubing or pipe string through the use of 
various techniques. More recently, we have proposed an automatically 
releasing gun hanger (U.S. patent no. 5,156,213 to George). 
This patent describes an automatically releasing gun hanger 
which is run into the well on a rigid tubing string or pipe 
string. The gun hanger is set within the well by a rotating 
motion of the rigid tubing string or pipe string. The rigid 
tubing string or pipe string is then disconnected from the 
guns attached to the gun hanger through further rotational 
motion. The pipe string can then be removed from the well. 
The perforating gun is fired by a pressure actuated firing 
head and upon firing of the perforating gun, the gun hanger 
automatically releases, thus allowing the guns to drop to 
the bottom of the well and leave an unobstructed flow path 
from the perforations up through the wellbore. Even more recently, it has been proposed to run 
the perforating guns into the well on a coiled tubing 
string. In such cases, rotation of the string (as with a  
 
rigid tubing string or pipe string) is impossible. In our 
European patent application no. 94306918.7, we have 
described a modified version of the apparatus shown in the 
George U.S. patent. In this modified version, the actuating 
mechanism of the gun hanger is modified so that it is 
operated by a simple reciprocating motion of the coiled 
tubing string without the need for any rotating motion. 
Also, a pressure responsive release mechanism connects the 
coiled tubing string to the perforating gun so that, after 
the gun hanger has been set within the casing, pressure 
within the coiled tubing string may be increased to release 
the coiled tubing string from the perforating gun, thus 
allowing the coiled tubing string to be retrieved prior to 
firing of the perforating guns. While the George and improved George systems work 
well, in some well situations problems can arise. For 
example, when there is an insufficient rathole below the 
well formation to drop the entire gun assembly, a portion of 
the gun assembly may interfere with flow of fluids from the 
perforat

A method of perforating a casing (12) of a well, 
said method comprising the steps of lowering a first 

perforating gun section (16) into the casing (12);
 
supporting said first perforating gun section (16) in said 

casing adjacent to a first portion of a subsurface formation 
to be perforated; lowering an additional perforating gun 

section (36) into said casing; supporting said additional 
perforating gun section (36) on said first perforating gun 

section (16) adjacent to another portion of said subsurface 
formation; and firing said perforating gun sections (16,36) 

and perforating said casing (12). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the step of 
supporting said first perforating gun section (16) comprises 

providing a gun hanger (24) on said first perforating gun 
section (16); and setting said gun hanger (24) into 

engagement with said casing (12). 
A method according to claim 2, further comprising 
releasing said gun hanger (24) from engagement with said 

casing (12) after firing said perforating gun sections 
(16,36). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the step of 
supporting said first perforating gun section (62) comprises 

providing a length of pipe (64) connected to a lower end 
(66) of said first perforating gun section (62); and 

engaging said pipe with a lower surface in the wellbore. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the step of 
supporting said first perforating gun section (52) 

comprises, prior to lowering said first perforating gun 
section (52), setting a support member (56) into engagement 

with said casing (12) at a location; and engaging said first  
 

perforating gun section (52) with said support member (56) 
after lowering said first perforating gun section into said 

casing. 
A method according to claim 5, wherein said 
support member (56) is a bridge plug. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
further comprising the step of retrieving at least one of 

said perforating gun sections (16,36,52,62) from said 
casing. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein said additional perforating gun section (36) is one 

of a plurality of additional perforating gun sections, each 
of said additional perforating gun sections being supported 

on an adjacent perforating gun section. 
A method according to claim 8, comprising 
repeating said step of lowering an additional perforating 

gun section into said casing as many times as desired.
