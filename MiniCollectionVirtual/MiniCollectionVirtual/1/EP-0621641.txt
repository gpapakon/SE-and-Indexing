<ABSTRACT>
A heterojunction bipolar transistor includes a 
collector contact layer (15), a collector layer (14), a base layer (13), 

and an emitter layer (12) laminated in this order on the front 
surface of a compound semiconductor substrate (16), a collector 

electrode (19) disposed on the collector contact layer (15), 
a base electrode (18) 

disposed on the base layer (13) , an emitter electrode (17) disposed on 
the emitter contact layer (11), and an insulating film (21) 

produced on the 
collector electrode (19) and the base electrode (18) burying those 

electrodes with the front surface thereof being flat. The 
front surface of the emitter electrode (17) positioned uppermost 

among surfaces of the three electrodes is on the same plane 
as the flattened front surface of the insulating film and a 

wiring is directly produced on the emitter electrode. Thus, 
this HBT has no step difference between etched surfaces, and 

the wiring is produced by repeating sputtering of Ti/Au and 
Ar⁺ ion-milling. Therefore, the wiring for the emitter 

electrode (17) can be formed easily and minutely at high 
preciseness. In addition, the collector electrode (19) is 

produced by evaporation and lift-off after required portions 
of the base layer and the collector layer are removed by 

dry-etching and a little wet-etching, so that the collector 
electrode (19) can be produced with generating no burr.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heterojunction 
bipolar transistor (hereinafter referred to as "HBT"), and a 
production method thereof and, more particularly, to a 
technique of flattening an HBT. Figure 4 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a prior 
art AlGaAs/GaAs HBT. In the figure, reference numeral 6 
designates a semi-insulating (hereinafter alternatively 
referred to as "S. I.") GaAs substrate. A collector contact 
layer 5 is disposed on the semi-insulating GaAs substrate 6. 
A collector layer 4 is disposed on the collector contact 
layer 5. A base layer 3 is disposed on the collector layer 
4. An emitter layer 2 is disposed on the base layer 3. An 
emitter contact layer 1 is disposed on the emitter layer 2. 
A collector electrode 9 is disposed on the collector contact 
layer 5. A base electrode 8 is disposed on the base layer 
3. An emitter electrode 7 is disposed on the emitter layer 
2. First insulating regions 20 are produced by first proton 
bombardment, reaching an interface between the collector 
contact layer 5 and the collector layer 4. Second 
insulating regions 30 are produced by second proton 
bombardment, reaching a portion of the semi-insulating  
 
substrate 6. An insulating film 11 is formed on all the 
above-described layers and electrodes. The materials of respective layers and respective 
electrodes, impurity concentrations and thicknesses thereof 
are as shown in table 1.
