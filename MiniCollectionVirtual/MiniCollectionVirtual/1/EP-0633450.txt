<ABSTRACT>
Method for detecting and examining a slightly 
irregular surface state is provided which includes the 

steps of: illuminating a surface of a sample with light 
beam for detecting the slightly irregular surface state; 

observing a variation of the light beam occurring due to 
the slightly irregular surface state to specify the 

location of the slightly irregular surface state in an x-y 
plane of the sample; making the location of a probe needle 

of a scanning probe microscope and the location of the 
slightly irregular surface state on the sample coincide 

with each other; and measuring a three-dimensional image 
of the slightly irregular surface state by means of the 

scanning probe microscope. The scanning probe microscope 
for use in the aforementioned method is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanning probe microscope.In the present invention, the words "slightly
irregular surface state" includes, for example, a state
where fine particles are adhered on a surface, a condition
where fine or micro projections and fine or micro pits are
present, an abnormal condition caused by a crystal defect
or the like. Further, the term "analyzer such as a
scanning probe microscope" is meant to include an
observing apparatus, an analyzing apparatus, an examining
apparatus and an evaluating apparatus, each having an
atomic force microscope (AFM), a scanning tunnel 
microscope (STM), a magnetic force microscope (MFM) or the
like.In the manufacture of VLSIs, typically a 4Mbit- or
16Mbit-DRAM, the production yield is known to almost
depend upon failures attributable to slightly irregular
surface states, such as fine particles adhering to a
wafer. This is because with increasingly miniaturizing
pattern width slightly irregular surface states which have
not been considered critical come to play the role of
contaminants. In general, the size of a slightly
irregular surface state herein in question is considered
as small as the minimum interconnection line width of a
VLSI to be manufactured reduced by a factor of several.
From this, in the manufacture of a 16Mbit-DRAM of which
the minimum interconnection line width is 0.5 µ m a
slightly irregular surface state of the order of 0.1 µ m
diameter is concerned with. Such a slightly irregular
surface state acts as a contaminant and hence is
responsible for break, shortcircuiting of a circuit
pattern or the like. This leads to products prone to
failure, hence, products of degraded reliability and
quality. For that reason, in improving the production
yield it is a critical point that the realities of
slightly irregular surface states, for examle in what
conditions they adhere to a sample, be grasped and
controlled by quantitative measurement and analysis with
high precision.As the means to accomplishing this end, a
particle detector has been conventionally used which is
capable of detecting a slightly irregular surface state
present on a surface of a flat sample such as a silicon
wafer. Examples of such conventional particle detectors
include IS-2000 and LS-6000, products of Hitachi Denshi
Engineering Ltd., SURFSCAN 6200, a product of Tencor Co.,
USA, and WIS-9000, a product of Estek Co., USA. The
measuring principle underlying these particle detectors
and the system configuration for realizing these detectors
are described in detail in,
