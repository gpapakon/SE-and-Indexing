<ABSTRACT>
A nearly ideal lubricant for high efficiency home refrigerators, especially those using chlorine free hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant working fluids, is the ester of trimethylolpropane with pentanoic acid. Mixtures including substantial quantities of this ester along with some other esters of hindered polyols having no more than four hydroxyl groups and acyl groups with predominantly no more than five carbon atoms are also satisfactory.

POLYOL ESTER LUBRICANTS FOR HIGH EFFICIENCY REFRIGERATORSCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of copend- ing International Application No. PCT/US92/04438 designat¬ ing the United States and filed June 3, 1992, the entire disclosure of which, except to the extent contrary to any explicit statement herein, is hereby incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to lubricant base stocks, which can also serve as complete lubricants in some cases; compounded lubricants, which include at least one additive for such purposes as improving high pressure resistance, corrosion inhibition, and the like along with the lubri- cant base stocks which contribute the primary lubricity to the compounded lubricants; refrigerant working fluids in¬ cluding lubricants according to the invention along with primary heat transfer fluids, and methods for using these materials. The lubricants and lubricant base stocks are generally suitable for use with most or all halocarbon refrigerants and are particularly suitable for use with substantially chlorine-free, fluoro-group-containing or¬ ganic refrigerating heat transfer fluids such as penta- fluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluroethane, and tetrafluoroethanes, most particularly 1,1,1,2-tetra- fluoroethane. The lubricants and base stocks, in combina¬ tion with these heat transfer fluids, are particularly suitable for domestic refrigerators with high operating efficiency, where relatively low viscosity lubricants are needed.Statement of Related ArtChlorine-free heat transfer fluids are desirable for 

use in refrigerant systems, because their escape into the atmosphere causes less damage to the environment than the currently most commonly used chlorofluorocarbon heat transfer fluids such as trichlorofluoromethane and di- chlorodifluoromethane. The widespread commercial use of chlorine-free refrigerant heat transfer fluids has been hindered, however, by the lack of commercially adequate lubricants. This is particularly true for one of the most desirable working fluids, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, com- monly known in the art as "Refrigerant 134a" or simply "R134a". Other fluoro-substituted ethanes are also desir¬ able working fluids.The following patents and published patent applica¬ tions also teach many general classes and specific exam- pies of polyol esters useful as refrigerant lubricants with chlorine-free fluoro group containing heat transfer fluids: US 4,851,144;
