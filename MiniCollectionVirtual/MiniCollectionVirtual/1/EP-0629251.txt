<ABSTRACT>
A marking for the creation of a luminant surface on a substrate (10) which surface is intended to be used as direction-, wearing- and/or side-markings on roads, streets, quays or parking places and which surface is subjected to water and tire wearing from passing vehicles. The marking comprises a binder (11) which fluoresces by irradiation with UV-A-light. The surface of the marking has light permeable glass pearls (12) having a size of between 0.4 and 1.0 millimetre which are embedded to about 50 and 75 % of their size in the binder (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a marking for the creation 
of a luminescent surface of a substrate which surface is 
intended to be used as a marking for directions, warning 
and/or side marking of roads, streets, quays or parking 
areas and which surface is subjected to water and tire 
wearing from passing vehicles which marking comprises a 
binder which is fluorescing when being irradiated by UV-A-light. 
Further, the invention relates to a process for the 
production of such a luminescent surface. The use of glass pearls in and on road markings as 
reflecting pearls is since long commonly known and is 
prescribed also by authorities in several countries. The object of the glass pearls is to re-reflect incoming 
light from vehicles to the driver of the vehicle during 
darkness and thereby increase the visibility of the road 
markings. The function is commonly known as retro-reflection. The glass pearls fulfil their task during darkness when 
they are activated by the headlights or dipped headlights 
of vehicles. The distance of visibility at dipped 
headlights is however less than half of the corresponding 
distance for full headlights.  
 At rain or when the coating with the glass pearls for other 
reasons are covered with a water film, the incoming light 
is mirrored away from the vehicle and the vehicle driver so 
that the marking at the best only is visible a few metre 
ahead of the vehicle. In fog the visible light of the vehicle is reflected by the 
small water drops of which the fog consists and the visible 
distance of the vehicle driver is often reduced to less 
than 20 metres, which is almost the same as the reaction 
distance at a speed of 70 km/h before the driver can start 
braking. The same occurs also when snowing. The difference 
is only that it is snowflakes which reflect the light of 
the vehicle and prevents that it gets its full distance. To improve the distance of visibility one has tried to 
equip the vehicles with lamps that emits ultra violet light 
within the wave length of 320-400 nm, whereby the 
fluorescing coatings is influenced by the ultra violet 
light and emits visible light within the area of wave 
length of 400 nm. As the ultra violet light is not mirrored away by a water 
film or re-reflected back by fog or snowflakes the 
fluorescing coating is activated by the ultra violet light, 
also under a water film and through fog and snowing and 
emits visible light which makes the coating visible for the 
driver also when it is covered by a water film, fog or 
snowflakes.

<CLAIMS>
Marking for the creation of a luminescant surface 
on a support (10) which surface is intended to be used as 

direction-, warning-, and/or side markings of roads, 
streets, quays or parking places and which surface is 

subjected to water and tyre wearing from passing vehicles 
which marking comprises a binder (11) which fluoresces by 

irradiation with UV-A-light, and light permeable glass 
pearls (12) which are embedded to between 50 and 75% of their 

size in the binder, 
characterized
 in that the 
glass pearls (12) have a size in the range between 0,4 and 

1,0 millimetre, and a size tolerance of at 
most 0,1 millimetre and an iron oxide content below 0,1%. 
Marking according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the glass pearls have a 
size of about 0,6 to 1,0 millimetres. 
Marking according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that the glass pearls (12) 
have a refraction index of between 1,45 and 1,60. 
Method for the production of a luminescent surface 
of a support (10), which surface is intended to be used as 

direction-, warning- and/or side-markings of roads, 
streets, quays or parking places and which surface is 

subjected to water and tyre wearing from passing vehicles,
characterized
 in that a desired part of the 
support (10) is covered with a layer of a thermo-plastic 

binder (11) which contains colour pigments which fluoresces 
upon irradiation with UVA-light, that the layer is strewn  

 
with round light permeable glass pearls (12) with a size of 

0,4-1,0 mm and a size tolerance of at most 
0,1 millimetre, and an iron oxide content below 0,1% and 

that the glass pearls are embedded to 50-75% of their size 
in the binder (11). 
Method according to claim 4,
characterized
 in that the glass pearls (12) 
are added to the binder at most 20-30 s after the application 

of the binder. 
Method according to claim 4 or 5,
 
characterized in that the glass pearls (12) are added by 

means of pressure air via a nozzle which is directed 
substantially perpendicularly towards the covering at a 

distance from the covering surface of approximately 5-15 
cm.
