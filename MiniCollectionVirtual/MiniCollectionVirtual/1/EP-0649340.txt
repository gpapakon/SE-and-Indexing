<ABSTRACT>
A multi-purpose apparatus (10) or vessel capable of completing the operations which would normally necessitate the use of three separate units, namely a reaction vessel, an isolator filter and a dryer is disclosed. The apparatus (10) comprises a general cylindrical vessel (12) with a top portion (14) and a bottom portion (18) which are connected to one another by a sidewall (16). The vessel is divided into an upper reaction unit (20) and a lower filtration unit (22) by a crosswall (24). A drive shaft (28), driven by a drive (30) with a lifting/lowering facility passes into the upper reaction unit (20) through crosswall (24) into lower filtration unit (22). The drive shaft (28) is capable of both longitudinal and rotational movement within the respective first and second units (20; 22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multi-purpose 
apparatus and more particularly, though not 
exclusively to a vessel capable of completing the 
operations which would normally necessitate the use of 
three separate units, for example a reaction vessel, 
an isolator filter and a dryer. Traditionally, many chemical processes, 
particularly the production of fine chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals require a three stage operation which 
includes the steps of: 
1. reacting the starting materials and crystalising 
the resulting product, 2. filtering the product, and 3. drying it. This process requires at least two vessels, a 
reaction vessel and a filtration drying unit. Both 
the reaction vessel and the filtration drying unit 
utilize drive shafts to operate agitators and 
smoothing arms respectively. The drives are both 
expensive and bulky as are the vessels. Furthermore, 
the reaction vessel is ideally set up above and to the 
side of the filtration unit so that the reactant can 
be easily transferred from the reaction vessel to the 
filtration drying unit. This arrangement takes up  
 
space (both height and width) which could be utilized 
in other ways. Also from the processing stand point the transfer 
of material at the end of each stage gives rise to a 
risk of contamination and reduced yields. An improved vessel has been supplied by Rosenmund 
AG under the Trade Mark NUTREX. This multi-purpose 
apparatus offers the capability of carrying out the 
operations of reaction, filtration and drying in 
immediate sequence within a single vessel. One end of the vessel acts as a 
reaction/crystallization unit whilst the other end 
acts as a filtration/washing/reslurry unit, it being 
necessary to rotate the single vessel through 180o 
from a position in which reaction takes place to a 
position in which filtration takes place. The 
apparatus can then be rotated through a further 50o 
(230o in total) to a position in which drying and 
discharge can take place. Whilst such an arrangement saves space, there 
being a single unit compared to the at least two 
separate units of conventional apparatus the 
arrangement suffers a number of draw backs. These 
include: 
1. a requirement to disconnect and reconnect the 
service pipes for the different operations as a result  
 
of rotating the apparatus, 2. the provision of two drive systems, a large 
one for rotating the apparatus and another for 
controlling a double-shafted agitator system comprising 
a stationary agitator for reaction and an axially 
operable smoothing

<CLAIMS>
A multi-purpose apparatus (10) comprising 
first and second units (20;22), the first unit (20) 

serving as a reaction vessel includes an elongate drive 
shaft (28), said drive shaft being capable of 

rotational movement and having an agitator arm fitted 
thereto and the second unit (22) serving as a 

filtration and or drying unit, means (24;42;44) 
enabling isolation and communication therebetween, the 

apparatus being characterised in that the elongate 
drive shaft (28) passes through the reaction vessel 

(20) into the filtration and/or drying unit (22) or 
vice versa, said drive shaft (28) being capable of both 

longitudinal and rotational movement within the 
respective first and second units (20;22) said drive 

shaft having fitted thereto in the second unit, a 
smoothing and pressing arm. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which 
the elongate drive shaft is a one piece shaft. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which 

the elongate drive shaft comprises a plurality of 
coupled shafts. 
An apparatus as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims wherein the first and second units are 

the first and second chambers of a single vessel which 
is sub-divided by a crosswall. 
An apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
3 in which the two units are separate vessels 

positioned one above the other, the elongate drive 
shaft being mounted so as to operate within both 

vessels. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 4 in which 
the single vessel is a generally cylindrical vessel 

having a top portion and a base portion which are 
connected by a side wall, which vessel is sub-divided  

 
by the crosswall into an upper reaction chamber and a 

lower filtration chamber, the crosswall extending 
inwards of the side wall substantially perpendicular to 

a longitudinal axis of the drive shaft which drive 
shaft passes through the top portion into the reaction 

chamber and through the crosswall into the filtration 
chamber. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 6 in which 
the drive shaft passes substantially through the centre 

of the top portion of the first unit, into the reaction 
chamber and substantially through the centre of the 

crosswall into the second unit situated therebelow. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7 wherein the 
drive shaft is retained about the crosswall by a 

bellows and rotary bearings. 
An apparatus as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims which further comprises an access port 

at the top of the reaction vessel and an exit port and 
valve means at the bottom of the filtration unit. 
An apparatus as claimed in any of the
