<ABSTRACT>
1.2. Various methods and devices of this type are known, for example those which generate only shift-recommendation signals or those which, when predeterminable threshold values are exceeded during driving, emit a warning signal when an unfavourable driving mode lasts too long and which record the number of warning signals given. 2.2. In the new method, a first evaluation number relating to the traction mode of the motor vehicle is formed, a second evaluation number relating to the driving mode free of engine load is formed, a third evaluation number relating to the deceleration mode of the motor vehicle is formed and, by weighted averaging from the three individual evaluation numbers, a total evaluation number is formed. This allows the differentiated objective evaluation of the driver-influenceable driving behaviour. 2.3. The invention is used, for example, in commercial vehicles.

A process for the assessment of driving behaviour with a motor
vehicle, in particular a utility vehicle, in which assessment values relating to

adherence to a pre-programmable pattern of driving behaviour can be
calculated derived from vehicle-specific measured quantities,
characterised in that
a first assessment value (B1) is calculated for the traction of the motor
vehicle with the allocation of appropriate operating phases to weighted

engine speed/engine load characteristic map matrix sectors,
a second assessment value (B2) is calculated for the thrust/braking
action of the motor vehicle with the allocation of appropriate operating

phases to weighted engine speed sub-sectors and
a third assessment value (B3) is calculated for the retarding action of
the motor vehicle with the allocation of appropriate operating phases to

weighted retardation value sub-sectors.
A process in accordance with Claim 1, further
characterised in that

in order to determine the first assessment value (B1) for traction the follow
steps are taken:


the engine speed/engine load characteristic map is divided into a
characteristic map matrix with at least two load and two speed sectors; 
a weighting factor (GFz
ij
) representing the extent of the targeted use of
the respective speed/load sectors is allocated to each characteristic map

matrix sector (i, j);
under road load the absence or presence of traction is detected and
during traction phases a proportional traction value (Bz
ij
), in particular
either a value proportionate to drive time, a value proportionate to

distance covered or a value proportionate to engine speed, is
determined for each matrix map (i, j) and the first assessment value (B1)

is calculated by multiplying each proportional traction value by the
relevant weighting factor, adding together all the resulting products and

dividing the sum thus obtained by the sum of all the proportional
traction values.
A process in accordance with Claim 2, further
characterised in that

in traction phases in which the highest gear of the vehicle's manual
transmission is engaged no determination of the first assessment value

takes place.
A process in accordance with Claim 2 or 3, further
characterised in that
the characteristic map matrix sectors are differentiated into targeted and
non-targeted load conditions by the allocation of appropriate weighting

factors above or below a threshold value, 
the uninterrupted time elapsed in non-targeted load conditions is
measured and
a gear change-up indicator signal is generated if the measured time
elapsed in non-targeted traction conditions exceeds a pre-programmable

maximum time.
A process in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 4, further
characterised in that

in order to determine the second assessment value (B2) for no-load motor
vehicle operation the following steps are taken:


the engine speed sector is divided into several sub-sectors;
a weighting factor (GFs
i
) representing the extent of the targeted use of
speed values in this sub-sector is allocated to each speed sub-sector (i);
under road load the absence or presence of no-load operation and
activation of the service brakes is detected and in thrust/braking phases

a proportional thrust/braking value (Bs
i
) is determined for each speed
sub-sector and the second assessment value is calculated by multiplying

each proportional thrust/braking value (Bs
i
) by the relevant weighting
factor (GFs
i
), adding together all the resulting products and dividing the
sum thus obtained by the sum of all proportional thrust/braking values.
A process in accordance with Claim 5, further
characterised in that
by allocating appropriate thrust/brake weighting factors which lie above
or below a pre-programmable threshold value, the engine speed sub-sectors

can be differentiated according to targeted and non-targeted
load conditions,
the activation of the services brakes can be detected,
when no-load engine operation and activated service brake operation is
detected, the driving time elapsed in non-targeted speed sub-sectors is

measured and
a gear change-down indicator signal is generated when the measured
time elapsed in the non-targeted speed sub-sectors exceeds a pre-programmable

maximum time.
A process in accordance with Claim 6, further
characterised in that
in order to determine the time elapsed in non-targeted engine speed
regions in thrust/braking operation a counter value (Zs) timed from a

minimum value is incremented in non-targeted speed sub-sectors and
decremented to this minimum value in targeted speed sub-sectors, and
the gear down-change indicator signal is generated when the counter
value (Zs) exceeds a pre-programmable limit value (Gs) and the counter

is then reset to the minimum value.
A process in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 7, further
characterised in that
 
in order to determine the third assessment value (B3) for vehicle

retardation the following steps are taken:

the retardation value sector is divided into several sub-sectors;
a weighting factor (GFv
i
) representing the extent of the targeted use of
retardation values in this sub-sector is allocated to each retardation sub-sector;
under road load the absence or presence of service brake activation is
detected and a proportional retardation value (Bv
i
) is determined for
each retardation value sub-sector and the third assessment value is

calculated by multiplying each proportional retardation value (Bv
i
) by
the relevant weighting factor (GFv
i
), adding together all the resulting
products and dividing the sum thus obtained by the sum of all the

proportional retardation values.
A process in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 8, further
characterised in that

the input parameters for the assessment of driving behaviour, in particular
the weighting factors, the pre-programmable limit values and the counter

increments and decrements, can be programmed by the user.
A process in accordance with one of Claims 4 to 9, further
characterised in that

the indication of the gear change-up and/or gear change-down indicator
signal can be activated and de-activated by the driver. 
A process in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 10, further
characterised in that

an overall assessment value is determined by calculating the average of the
three pre-programmable weighted assessment values.
A process in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 11, further
characterised in that

the current values for the individual assessment values and/or the overall
assessment value are indicated automatically.
A process in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 11, further
characterised in that

assessment value are indicated at the instruction of the driver.
