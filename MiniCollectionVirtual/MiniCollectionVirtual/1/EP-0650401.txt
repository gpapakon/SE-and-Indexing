<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a cleaning method in which a solvent such as densified carbon dioxide can be used for rapid and efficient cleaning, but with decreased damage to solid components such as buttons. The method comprises contacting a substrate to be cleaned with a first fluid, removing the first fluid from contact with the substrate while replacing with a second fluid, and recovering the substrate substantially free of the first and second fluids and from the contaminant. The first fluid is a densified gas while the second fluid is a compressed gas. A preferred embodiment of the method includes the use of a pretreatment designed for compatibility with the densified first fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to cleaning 
contaminants from textile substrates, and more 
particularly to a cleaning method using a solvent such 
as carbon dioxide in liquid or supercritical state that 
provides improved cleaning, decreased damage to 
components such as buttons, and decreased redeposition 
of contaminants. Cleaning contaminants from metal, machinery, 
precision parts, and textiles (dry cleaning) using 
hydrocarbon and halogenated solvents has been practiced 
for many years. Recently the environmental, health, and 
cost risks associated with this practice has become 
prohibitive. Carbon dioxide holds potential advantages 
among other non-polar solvents for this type of 
cleaning. It avoids many of the environmental, health, 
hazard, and cost problems associated with more common 
solvents. Liquid/supercritical fluid carbon dioxide has 
been suggested as an alternative to halocarbon solvents 
in removing organic and inorganic contaminants from the 
surfaces of metal parts and in cleaning fabrics. For  
 
example, NASA Technical Brief MFA-29611 entitled 
"Cleaning With Supercritical CO2" (March 1979) discusses 
removal of oil and carbon tetrachloride residues from 
metal. In addition, Maffei, U.S. Patent No. 4,012,194, 
issued March 15, 1977, describes a dry cleaning system in 
which chilled liquid carbon dioxide is used to extract 
soils adhered to garments. Such methods suggested for cleaning fabrics with a 
dense gas such as carbon dioxide have tended to be 
restricted in usefulness because they have been based on 
standard extraction processes where "clean" dense gas is 
pumped into a chamber containing the substrate while 
"dirty" dense gas is drained. This dilution process 
severely restricts the cleaning efficiency, which is 
needed for quick processing and encourages soil 
redeposition. Another problem with attempts to use carbon dioxide 
in cleaning is the fact that the solvent power of dense 
carbon dioxide is not high compared to ordinary liquid 
solvents. Thus, there have been attempts to overcome 
this solvent limitation. German Patent Application 3904514, published August 
23, 1990, describes a process in which supercritical 
fluid or fluid mixture, which includes polar cleaning 
promoters and surfactants, may be practiced for the 
cleaning or washing of clothing and textiles. WO 90/06189, published June 14, 1990, describes a 
process for removing two or more contaminants by 
contacting the contaminated substrate with a dense phase 
gas where the phase is then shifted

<CLAIMS>
A method for cleaning a substrate having a contaminant 
comprising: contacting the substrate with a substantially non-polar 

first fluid in a chamber, the first fluid being a densified gas in a liquid or 
in a supercritical state, for a sufficient time to separate the 

contaminant from the substrate; 

removing the first fluid from contact with the substrate and 
replacing with a non-polar second fluid, the second fluid being a 

compressed gas wherein the second fluid is used to displace the 
first fluid during the removing and the second fluid diffuses more 

slowly through permeable material in the chamber than does the 
first fluid; and, 
recovering the substrate substantially free of contaminants. 
The method as in claim 1 wherein the second fluid retards 
redeposition of the contaminant on the substrate. 
The method as in claim 1 wherein the second fluid reduces 
damage to the substrate and other material in the chamber. 
The method as in claim 1 wherein the pressure of fluid 
adjacent to the contaminant is at a value of about P
1
 as the 
contaminant separates, and the second fluid has a pressure about 

equal to P
1

the substrate. 
The method as in claim 1 or 4 wherein the substantially 
non-polar first fluid is selected from carbon dioxide, methane, 

ethane, propane, ammonium-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, cyclohexane,

benzene, toluene, p-xylene, chlorotrifluoromethane,

the contaminant separates, and the second fluid has temperature 

about equal to T

, as it replaces the first fluid and before 
recovering the substrate. 
The method as in claim 6 wherein the molar volume of the 
second fluid is greater than that of the first fluid. 
The method as in claim 1 wherein the contacting includes 
determining pathways between a variation of temperature, a 

variation of pressure, or a variation of temperature and pressure 
while separating the contaminant from the substrate, and selecting 

one of the determined pathways. 
The method as in claim 9 wherein the pathway selected 
includes elevating the temperature before reducing the pressure 

below about P
1
 to recover the substrate substantially free from 
damage. 
The method as in claim 1 further comprising:
