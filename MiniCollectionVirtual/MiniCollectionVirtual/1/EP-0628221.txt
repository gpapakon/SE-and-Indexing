<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a cable seal which comprises positioning a sealing material (2) around the cable (3); positioning a housing (4) around the sealing material; and subsequently positioning at the housing (4) restricting means (8) that can restrict movement of the sealing material (2) out of an outlet of the housing (4). Characterized in that the restricting means (8) is a snap or interference fit to the housing (4) and extends into the outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and article for 
forming a cable seal, in particular for forming a ready access butt 
closure for a telecommunications cable splice. Cable splices have to be sealed against the environment to 
prevent damage to the cable conductors and connectors joining them. 
When a cable splice is made, cable jacket is stripped back from the 
ends of the cables to be spliced to expose the conductors to be 
connected. After the splice is made a so-called splice case, or splice 
closure, is built up around the splice. In certain instances it is desirable for the splice to be of butt, 
rather than in-line configuration. This means that two or more 
cables lying side-by-side with their ends pointing in the same 
direction are spliced together. An advantage is that a housing 
comprising a domed cover can be slid over the resulting splice. A 
single seal then has to be made where the cables leave an outlet of 
the housing. In the case of an in-line splice (made between ends of 
cables that face one another) two seals need to be made, one at each 
end of a generally cylindrical housing that surrounds the splice. 
Also, the housing of a butt closure need not be of the wrap-around 
type and can still be removed. Various cable splice closures have been proposed in the past, a 
few of which will be reviewed below. US 4194082 (Campbell) disclosed a generally dome-shaped 
closure having a heat-shrinkable end that is shrunk down around an 
ingoing cable. As a result of heat-shrinkage, a seal is made around 
the cable, isolating the inside of the closure from the environment. WO 90/05401 (Raychem) discloses an in-line splice closure that 
can avoid the use of heat-shrinkable materials. A sealing material,  
 
for example a gel, is provided as part of end seals that seal gaps 
between in-going and out-going cables of a splice case, a central part 
of which comprises a generally cylindrical housing. The end seals 
comprise the gel between structures that can be brought together to 
deform the gel to seal it to the cables and the central housing. US 4701574 (Shimirak et al) also discloses a closure which 
includes a cable end seal and a central generally cylindrical housing. 
The end seals have an outer convoluted surface that mates with a 
convoluted surface of the cylindrical housing. In this way the end 
seals are retained in appropriate positions at the ends of the housing. US 3984623 (Worden) discloses a cable splice housing having a 
hollow, tubular, plastics body, an end of which

A method of forming a cable seal, which comprises: 

positioning a sealing material (2) around the cable (3); 
positioning a housing (4,5) around the sealing material; and 
subsequently positioning at the housing restricting means (8) that can restrict 
movement of the sealing material out of an outlet of the housing, the restricting 

means being a snap or interference fit around an external surface of the 

housing and having at least one projection (10) that extends through a hole (7) in the 
housing into the outlet thereof; 
 
characterised in that the restricting means (8) comprises a resilient metal or 

plastics band (9), and the said at least one projection (10) is at least one inwardly 
substantially radially-extending projection of the band. 
A method according to Claim 1, in which the sealing material comprises a gel. 
A method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, in which the sealing material is 
extended axially with respect to the cable, thereby contracting it transversely, before 

positioning the housing around it. 
A method according to any preceding claim, in which the sealing material is 
positioned around two or more cables side-by-side. 
A method according to Claim 4, in which a cable butt splice is sealed. 
A method according to any preceding claim, in which the housing comprises: 

(a) a first part (4) that surrounds the sealing material; and  
 
(b) a second part (5) that comprises a cover for the first part. 
An assembly for carrying out a method according to the first aspect of the 
invention, comprising: 


(a) a housing (4,5) for positioning around a cable (3), the housing having a hole (7) therein 
and also having an outlet for the cable; 
(b) a sealing material (2) for positioning around the cable to form a seal between 
the cable and the housing; and 
(c) restricting means (8) that can restrict movement of the sealing material out of 
the outlet of the housing, the restricting means being a snap or interference 

fit around an external surface of the housing and having at least one 
projection (10) that can extend through the hole (7) in the housing into the outlet 

thereof; 
 
characterised in that the restricting means (8) comprises a resilient metal or 

plastics band (9), and the said at least one projection (10) is at least one inwardly 
substantially radially - extending projection of the band. 
An assembly according to Claim 7, in which the sealing material comprises a 
gel. 
An assembly according to Claim 7 or Claim 8, which comprises a butt closure 
for a cable splice. 
An assembly according to any one of claims 7 to 9, in which the housing 
comprises: 


(a) a first part (4) that surrounds the sealing material; and 
(b) a second part (5) that comprises a cover for the first part.
