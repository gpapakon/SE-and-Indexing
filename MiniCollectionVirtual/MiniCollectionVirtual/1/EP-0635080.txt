<ABSTRACT>
Solvent pulping is practised using ethanol, methanol, formic acid, or the like by passing the organic solvent countercurrent to the cellulosic fibrous material (wood) being adjusted into paper pulp. The process may be batch or continuous. The pH of the process is relatively stable and neutral, and can be controlled to maintain the process generally neutral by removing the acids formed at the beginning of the cook, e.g. with spent solvent, and can be made more uniform by adding alkali to the wood just prior to the wood coming into countercurrent contact with the organic solvent. A catalyst, such as an earth-alkali metal salt or an organic base, may also be added to the wood to enhance dissolution of the ligning. The treated pulp is washed, and the solvent in the wash liquid from the washing stage may be separated by distillation. The pulp may be steamed prior to cooking. The lignin containing liquid (spent organic solvent) may also be distilled, with the organic solvent renturned to the cook, the water separated and reused, and the lignin combusted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new method of 
producing chemical pulp. The invention is an improvement 
in solvent cooking methods (e.g. organic solvent digestion), 
often referred to as "solvent pulping", being 
generally as described in U.S.-A- 3,585,104. Wood comprises cellulosic fibres with lignin both 
inside the fibres and between the fibres, bonding the 
fibres together. In order to carefully separate the fibres 
from each other, the lignin must be removed from between 
the fibres, the removal usually being accomplished by 
dissolving the lignin. Generally the cooking liquors 
consist of sodium hydroxide (i.e. soda cook), sodium 
hydroxide containing sodium sulphide (i.e. sulphate or 
kraft cook, also called alkaline cook), or, for example, 
sulphite ions sulphite cook, also called acid 
sulphite cook). Lignin can also be removed by some organic 
solvents (hence the commercial name organosolv-process), 
the best known of which are methanol and ethanol. Formic 
acid is another proposed organic solvent. Methanol and ethanol can be utilized as solvents in 
both alkaline and acid cooks. The advantage of acid cooks 
is the simple recovery of the chemicals, as wood contains 
acids that make the cook acid, when only methanol or 
ethanol are used as solvents. The disadvantage of acid 
cooks is the poor quality of the produced pulp, because 
the cellulosic fibres will, to some extent, degrade in 
acid treatment. In alkaline cooks the quality of the 
produced pulp will remain good, but the problem in 
alkaline cooks is the recovery of chemicals. Some alkali, 
mostly a sodium-based alkali, will firstly have to be 
added into the cook and then recovered and used again. A 
known alkaline organic solvent process is the "Organo-cell-process", 
presently being used in Germany, in which 
process the cook is a soda-methanol cook.  
 According to the present invention, it has been 
determined that during solvent pulping acids are formed in 
the very beginning of the cook. The pH of the cook can be 
kept in the desirable range (generally neutral) by 
removing the acids from the beginning of the cook, i.e. 
almost immediately after they are formed. By keeping the 
pH generally neutral, the pulp quality is enhanced, both 
for continuous and batch cooking processes. This is 
accomplished, in general, by countercurrent flow during 
continuous cooking, and in batch cooking by withdrawing 
solvent from the batch digester after a predetermined time 
from the start of the cook (and perhaps periodically 
thereafter),

A method of producing cellulose pulp from comminuted 
cellulosic fibrous material by organic solvent pulping, 

wherein 

(a) the comminuted cellulosic fibrous material is pretreated
