<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed toward anionic polymerization employing 
lithio aldimines mixed with an organic alkali metal randomizer compound and 

optionally, a chelating reagent. The lithio aldimines have the general formula (A)Li, 
where A is derived from a substituted aldimine. The invention is also directed toward 

polymers and other products made using the initiator, and methods therefor. Further, 
the invention contemplates a polymer, a polymer composition and products therefrom, 

which include a functional group from the reaction product of a substituted aldimine and 
an organolithium compound. The resulting polymers may be modified with a 

terminating, coupling or linking agent, which may provide the polymer with a 
multifunctionality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to anionic polymerization resulting in diene
polymer and copolymer elastomers. More particularly, the present invention relates to
polymerization employing a lithio-aldimine initiator which is a mixture of the reaction
product of an aldimine and an organo lithium compound, with an organic alkali metal
compound and a chelating reagent. The resulting polymers are chain-end modified and
the copolymers of which may contain a high amount of styrene.In the art, it is desirable to produce elastomeric compounds exhibiting
reduced hysteresis characteristics. Such elastomers, when compounded to form articles
such as tires and power belts, will show an increase in rebound, a decrease in
rolling resistance and a decrease in heat build-up when mechanical stresses are applied.A major source of hysteretic power loss has been established to be due to the
section of the polymer chain from the site of the last cross link of the vulcanizate to an
end of the polymer chain. This free end is not tied to the polymer molecular network
and thus cannot be involved in an efficient elastic recoverable process, and as a result,
the energy transmitted to this section of the cured sample is lost as heat. It is known
in the art that one way to reduce this phenomenon is to prepare higher molecular weight
polymers which will have fewer end groups. However, this procedure is not always
useful because processability of the rubber with compounding ingredients and during
shaping operations can decrease rapidly with increasing polymer molecular weight.It has also been recognized that carbon black, usually employed as a
reinforcing agent in rubber compounds, should be well dispersed throughout the rubber
in order to improve various physical properties. One example of the recognition is
provided in EP 0 316 255 which discloses a process
for end capping polydienes by reacting a metal terminated polydiene with a capping
agent such as a halogenated nitrile, a heterocyclic aromatic nitrogen containing
compound or an alkyl benzoate. Additionally, this application discloses that both ends 
of the polydiene chains can be capped with polar groups by utilizing functionalized
initiators, such as lithium amides.It is known in the art to employ a lithium amide with an alkali metal
compound, such as, for example, as discussed in JP 79-65,788.
That patent does not disclose the use of a chelating agent as is used in the
present invention. Further, the '788 patent is not directed toward a polymer having
improved hysteresis
