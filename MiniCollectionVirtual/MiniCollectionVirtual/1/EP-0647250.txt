<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to porous polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) compositions, shaped articles made
therefrom, and their preparation.U.S. Patents 4,360,488 and 4,385,026 disclose
formation of "non-draining" gels by heating PTFE with a
highly fluorinated high-boiling material at a
temperature close to the crystalline melting point of
the polymer (330-350°C). A solution or swollen mass
containing from about 1 to about 50 weight % polymer is
formed on heating, from which is recovered, on cooling,
a sponge-like gel, said gel being without defined shape
and retaining no "memory" of the crystallinity of the
original PTFE. The gel, after removal of the
fluorinated material by extraction in refluxing solvent
such as Freon®-113 (bp 45.8°C), is described as porous,
and could be formed into porous shapes, e.g. into porous
sheet by pressing between platens. The process appears
to employ granular PTFE only and, because crystalline
memory is lost during processing, the initial gels are
shapeless globs which require post fabrication into
shaped articles. The porous products have increased
crystallinity and a partially fibrillar structure. Use
as filter membranes or diaphragms for electrochemical
cells is disclosed.Microporous PTFE films and sheeting are known. U.S.
Patent 3,664,915 discloses uniaxially stretched film
having at least 40% voids and a highly fibrillar
structure. U.S. Patents 3,953,566, 3,962,153 and
4,187,390 disclose porous PTFE films having at least 70%
voids, said films consisting of nodes and fibrils
wherein the nodes are at least 1000 times thicker than 
the fibrils. Pore size in the above films is at least
0.2 µm. Unsintered, paste-extruded PTFE film is
stretched at rates of over 2000%/sec and as high as
40,000%/sec to achieve porosity, followed by sintering
under constraint at 327 to 370°C. Such stretching rates
are far higher than those employed in conventional film
preparation. U.S. Patent 4,110,392 discloses
microporous PTFE films having pore sizes as low as
0.01 µm, achieved by stretching unsintered PTFE as
above, followed by sintering without constraint, then
stretching a second time at high speed. Porosities of
these films are 10 to 50%. Japanese Application
3-221541 discloses microporous PTFE film with pore size
of 0.1 to 0.2 µm. The films are prepared by a
modification of the above-described art procedures and
have different film morphology and improved air
permeability. However, ultrahigh stretching rates are
again required. The art does not provide the means of
improving porous PTFE

Process for preparing a porous shaped article of
polytetrafluoroethylene comprisig:


(a) contacting a shaped article of PTFE with a fluid which
penetrates and swells but does not significantly dissolve the polymer or eliminate

viscoelastic memory therefrom, at a temperature in the range of 250-400°C;
(b) cooling and separating the penetrated polymer/fluid
composition from unabsorbed fluid, said composition containing less than 50% by

weight of absorbed fluid; and
(c) removing the absorbed fluid, to form a porous shaped article

to 333°C with an associated heat of fusion of at least 35 J/g.
Process according to Claim 1 wherein, in step (c), absorbed fluid is
removed by evaporation or suction, or by extraction into a second, more volatile

fluid, wherein said second fluid is removed by evaporation.
