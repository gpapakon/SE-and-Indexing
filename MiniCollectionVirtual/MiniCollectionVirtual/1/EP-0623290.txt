<ABSTRACT>
A process for recycling waste from the manufacture of 
filtered cigarettes is disclosed herein. The process comprises 

the following steps: A waste stream from the manufacture of 
filtered cigarettes is provided. The waste stream includes 

tobacco, filter tips comprising cellulose ester polymer, and 
paper. A subst
antial portion of the filter tips is separated 
from this waste stream. The filter tips are washed with a 

sufficient volume of water to liberate bound tipping paper and to 
remove contaminants from the cellulose ester polymer. The 

cellulose ester polymer may then be dried, resolutioned, and 
processed into useful articles of commerce.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to recycling waste, particularly
cellulose esters, generated during the manufacture of filtered
cigarettes.Fibrous cellulose esters, particularly cellulose acetate,
are the commercially preferred media for filtration of smoke from
filtered cigarettes. This commercial application consumes
worldwide several hundred million pounds of cellulose acetate
fiber per year. During the production of these filtered
cigarettes, a certain percentage of them will not be brought to
market, due to damage of goods, variation from specification, or
other reasons. Those cigarette which are not sold are typically
subjected to a reclamation process wherein the tobacco-laden
portion of the cigarette is mechanically broken from the filter,
and the tobacco is removed by shaking within a screening device.
An example of this process is given in U.S. Patent No. 3,224,451.After reclamation of 
tobacco, several tens of millions of pounds of residual material,
referred to as "ripper waste" in the industry, comprised of
cellulose acetate (typically plasticized for example with
glycerol triacetate), paper, residual tobacco, and often flavors
and fragrances remain; this ripper waste is most generally
disposed of as landfill, representing both a loss of natural
resources and a burden on landfill capacity.The composition of ripper waste varies depending on the
specifics of the cigarette products and the tobacco reclamation
process employed. Typical composition ranges, by weight, of
ripper waste are: a) cellulose acetate, 40-55%; b) plasticizer,
1-12%; c) paper, 25-45%; d) residual tobacco, 1-15%; e)
adhesives, 2-3%; and f) flavors/fragrances, <1%. Additional
components, for example charcoal, may be found in these waste
streams, depending on the specific cigarette product.The physical/mechanical separations employed in reclaiming
cigarette components have in the past either focused on sifting
tobacco away from other components, as is the case in U.S. Patent
No. 3,224,451, or in the removal of cellulose acetate filter
media from its paper liner, as in U.S. Patent No. 4,261,790.Other approaches have
included enzymatic degradation of the cellulose acetate to
produce useful sugars, as in U.S. Patent No. 4,298,013. Isolation of cellulose acetate from ripper waste is
insufficient to provide a recycled product of high commercial
utility. During the manufacture of cigarettes, the cellulose
acetate is treated with a plasticizer which improves the
mechanical performance of the finished filter. The cellulose
acetate may

<CLAIMS>
A process for recycling the waste from the manufacture of
filtered cigarettes, said process comprising the steps of:


providing a waste stream from the manufacture of
filtered cigarettes, the waste stream including

tobacco, filter tips comprising cellulose ester
polymer, and paper;
separating the filter tips from the waste stream; and
washing the filter tips with water to remove any paper
bound to the filter tips and to remove any

contaminants from the cellulose ester polymer, wherein
the ratio of water to cellulose ester polymer is

between 0.85:1 and 200:1.
The process according to claim 1 wherein separating is by
means of air elutriation.
The process according to claim 1 wherein during separating
the tobacco content in the filter tips is reduced to at

least 1 % by weight.
The process according to claim 1 further comprising the
step of reducing the particle size of the waste

stream.
The process according to claim 1 wherein said water is
between 10 and 100 °C.
The process according to claim 1 wherein said water has a
pH between 4.0 to 8.0. 
The process according to claim 1 further comprising adding
a surfactant, at less than 1.0 % by weigh
t, during washing.
The process according to claim 1 wherein said water is
steam with an operating pressure of up to 7.9 bar (100

psig).
The process according to claim 1 wherein a portion of said
water is between 10 and 100 °C , and a portion of the water

is steam with an operating pressure of up to 7.9 bar (100
psig).
The process according to claim 1 wherein said water
includes an oxidizer.
The process according to claim 1 further comprising the
step of pretreating said filter tips after separation from

said waste stream with an oxidizer.
A process for recycling filter tips from filtered
cigarettes, said process comprising the steps of:


providing a waste stream of filter tips and paper,
said filter tips comprising cellulose ester polymer;

and
washing the filter tips with water to remove any paper
bound to the filter tip and to remove any contaminates

from the cellulose ester polymers, wherein the ratio
of water to cellulose ester polymer is between 0.85:1

and 200:1.
