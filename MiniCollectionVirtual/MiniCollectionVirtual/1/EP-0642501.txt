<DESCRIPTION>
Novel pilocarpine derivatives and process for their preparationThe present invention relates to novel pilocarpine prodrug compounds useful for the treatment of glaucoma, and specifically to bispilocarpic acid esters, processes for the preparation of the said novel compounds, pharmaceuti¬ cal compositions containing the novel compounds and their use.(+)-pilocarpine, (3S-cis)-3-ethyldihydro-4-[ (1-methyl-lH- imidazol-5-yl)methyl]-2(3H)-furanone, is a drug which is used for the treatment of glaucoma, which lowers the ocular pressure by increasing the flow of chamber fluid from the eye. The intraocular pressure reducing effect of pilocar¬ pine is based on the ciliary muscle contracting effect of the drug widening the angle of the anterior chamber which is important from the viewpoint of the outflow of the chamber fluid and the outflow of the fluid is facilitated.The reduction of the intraocular pressure is, however, not the only effect of pilocarpine in the eye. When the drug concentration is sufficiently high, the contracting effect of pilocarpine on the ciliary muscle is increased, resul¬ ting in the adaptation of the ocular lens for seeing at close distance. It is then difficult for the patient to accommodate the eye for seeing at a greater distance, which is inconvenient for the patient. Pilocarpine also causes the iris of the eye to contract, the pupil of the eye decreasing considerably. Besides these effects on the eye which are unnecessary from a medical point of view and unpleasant for the patient, pilocarpine may cause side effects outside the eye. Such effects are i.a. increased salivation and bradycardia.Conventionally glaucoma patients administer pilocarpine locally as eyedrops. Administered in such a manner, 

however, only about 1 % of the pilocarpine dose is absor¬ bed by the eye and about 70 % in the blood stream. The low absorption rate of pilocarpine in the eye is due to three major factors:1) the drop is quickly flushed away from the surface of the eye2) the rapid absorption of pilocarpine into the blood stream through the conjunctiva of the inner surface of the eyelid3) the poor corneal penetration capability of pilo¬ carpine.Pilocarpine is absorbed into the eye through the cornea. In the cornea it is first absorbed in the dense epithelium layer on the eye surface containing cell membrane lipids (fats) in abundance. However, pilocarpine is not very fat soluble wherefore it penetrates relatively little into the corneal epithelium. The corneal epithelium functions simultaneously as a film
