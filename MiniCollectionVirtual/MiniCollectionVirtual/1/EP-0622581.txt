<ABSTRACT>
A novel method for sealing the end of tubing (112) connected 
to and extending from a container (110) housing workpieces to be 

thermally processed using mechanical as well as thermal means. 
The invention also contemplates a novel tubing member for 

connection to such a container, where the sealing material is 
disposed within the tubing member prior to insertion of the 

tubing into the container. After fixing the tubing in the 
container, a plurality of locations (140) along the length of the 

tubing are identified where mechanical closure of the tubing is 
effected. Then, the tubing is heated to a temperature 

sufficiently high to melt the contained sealing material at the 
crushed locations, such that a metallurgical seal is formed 

inside the tubing at the crushed locations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes and apparatus
for sealing containers, and more particularly to a method and
apparatus for tightly sealing metal evacuation tubes of a
container using brazing techniques.There are a variety of applications in which metal
tubing is used where it must be sealed against the atmosphere.
In such cases, the tubing is usually attached to a container
which either has been evacuated and thus is at a pressure lower
than the environment which contains the container, or has been
filled with gas or other fluid under a pressure higher than the
environment which contains the container. One example of an area of technology in which it is
desirable to effect the sealing of tubing is where a controlled
environment is necessary, as in the context of diffusion bonding
a workpiece made of a reactive metal, such as titanium or its
alloys. The controlled environment is typically attained through
the use of a metallic envelope or container known as a "retort",
which envelopes a workpiece that has been prepared for diffusion
bonding. The retort comprises upper and lower metal members
which are to be sealed at edge regions about the workpiece.
Typically, tubing is connected to the chamber formed by the upper
and lower metal members of the retort within which the workpiece
is contained. After sealing the edge regions of the chamber, the
fluid in the chamber is evacuated by vacuum pump means coupled to
the chamber via the tubing. It is this tubing which must also be
sealed after the chamber has been evacuated.Another situation where sealing of tubing is desirable
involves the filling of a container with a pressurized fluid or
with a fluid which develops a pressure greater than the ambient
pressure upon a change in ambient temperature. Following the
filling of the container, it is neccesary to hermetically seal
the tubing used to deliver the fluid. The principal problem confronted when attempting to
isolate either a pressurized chamber or an evacuated chamber from
the environment is the attainment of a complete seal of the
tubing following manipulation of the fluid contents in the
chamber.Several techniques for sealing tubing are known;
mechanical deformation or crimping; welding; and soldering. In the
case of mechanical deformation, the tubing is first heated and
then caused to collapse via a crushing force applied using a
mechanical tool. In welding, two pieces of metal to be joined
are disposed atop one another and melted and, upon cooling, the
two pieces become one piece. In soldering,

A method for isolating the pressurized interior of a container (110) from
the environment

by sealing tubing (112) coupled to the container (110) before
subjecting the container to a thermal treatment

comprising the steps of:

(1) providing a predetermined amount of brazing
material inside a length (114) of said tubing (112);
(2) forming a plurality of crimps (140;142) in a region of the
tubing (112), said region encompassing said length (114); and
(3) heating said region of said tubing (112) to a brazing
material melting point, whereby said brazing material

melts and flows to form a metallurgical weld at each
said crimp (140;142).
The method of claim 1, wherein said brazing material is
provided concentrically inside said length (114) of tubing (112). 
The method of claim 1, wherein said brazing material has
the form of a cylindrical member (118), and said step of providing a

predetermined amount of brazing material includes inserting a
tightly fitting cylindrical member (118) of said brazing material

within said tubing (112).
The method of claim 3, wherein said cylindrical member
is solid.
The method of claim 3, wherein said cylindrical member
is hollow.
The method of claim 1, wherein said tubing (112) is coupled
between said container (110) and an evacuation pump (120), and further

including the step of actuating the pump (120) to effect evacuation of
said container (110), said actuating step being carried out before said

step of forming a plurality of crimps (114) in said tubing (112). 
A sealable tubing member (112) adapted for connection to a pressurized container (110)
housing a workpiece

where the container, tubing and workpiece will be
subjected to a thermal treatment,

said
tubing member (112) being formed by

   a metallic material having a cylindrical configuration,
and comprising:


a layer of brazing material covering a length of the
interior surface of said tubing member,
said tubing member (112) comprising a plurality of
crimps (140) formed in a region (114) which spans

the length of the tubing member (112) which includes
said layer of brazing material, whereby said crimps (140) are formed

without destroying the
brazing capability of said layer of brazing material.
The sealable tubing member (112) of claim 7, wherein said
layer of brazing material comprises a coating of brazing alloy

adhered to said interior surface region.
The sealable tubing member (112) of claim 7, wherein said
layer of brazing material comprises a sleeve member (118), or

wherein said layer of brazing material comprises a deposit of
powder.
