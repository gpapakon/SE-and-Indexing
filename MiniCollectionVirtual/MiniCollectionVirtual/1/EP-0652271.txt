<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a well fluid 
additive, to a method of treating a well fluid, to a 
well fluid and to a method of treating well equipment, 
e.g. drilling, completion or workover equipment. Hydrocarbons are found in subterranean formations 
and are produced through wells penetrating producing 
formations. Production of oil and gas is generally 
accomplished through the use of rotary drilling 
technology, which requires the drilling, completing and 
working over of wells. The formation is composed of both inorganic and 
organic substances, such as clays and other minerals as 
well as fossils, peat etc. As the drill bit teeth 
penetrate the formation, drill chips are generated by 
the action of the bit. These drill chips are wetted by 
the drilling fluid which can produce sticky, plastic 
fragments. These fragments adhere to the bit surface and 
the force and weight of the bit extrudes the water from 
the plastic fragments forming a compacted mass of the 
formation on the bit surface that interferes with the 
cutting action of the bit teeth as evidenced by a 
reduction in penetration rate. Balling also occurs on 
drill collars and stabilizers, further interfering with 
drilling operations. Bit balling, resulting in the compaction and 
adherence of drill chips to the face of the cutters and 
the bit, is a primary cause of reduction of penetration 
rate during drilling operations. Bit balling is believed 
to be the result of adhesive forces between shale and 
the bit surface which become significant when ductile 
shales deform and are forced into intimate contact with  
 
each other and the bit surface. A liquid adheres to a solid surface if the 
attraction of the molecules to the solid surface is 
greater than their attraction to each other, i.e. the 
work of adhesion is greater than the work of cohesion. 
This criterion may be expressed thermodynamically as: 
WA = FS + FL - FIwhere WA is the work of adhesion; FS is the surface free 
energy of the solid; FL is the surface free energy of the 
liquid; and FI is the surface free energy of the newly 
formed interface. In terms of this expression, the work 
of cohesion, WC, is equal to xFL. In order for adhesion to occur between the solid 
surface and a liquid, the work of adhesion must be 
greater than that of cohesion: 
WA - WC = FS - FL - FIAccordingly, adhesion of the liquid to a solid 
occurs when the surface free energy of the solid surface 
exceeds that of the liquid and interface: 
FS > FL + FIShales adhere to bits and drill collars if
