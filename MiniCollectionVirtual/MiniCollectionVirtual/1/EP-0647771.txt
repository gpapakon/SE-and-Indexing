<ABSTRACT>
In an exhaust apparatus of conventional type for an internal 
combustion engine of a motor-vehicle, one or more tubes (4',10',12') 

connecting the various active elements (3',5',6') of the apparatus are 
modified so that they contribute to the silencing and/or catalytic 

function, which allows for a reduction of the volume of the active 
components of the apparatus (catalytic converter (3'), first and second 

silencing device (5',6')), while keeping the global efficiency of the 
apparatus unchanged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to exhaust apparatus 
for internal combustion engines, of the known type 
comprising: 
an exhaust manifold, including manifold tubes, a catalytic converter, a flexible tubing interposed between the exhaust 
manifold and the catalytic converter, a first and a second silencing devices arranged 
in series downstream of the catalytic converter (with 
reference to the direction of flow of the engine 
exhaust gasses), connecting tubes interposed between the catalytic 
converter and the first silencing device, as well as 
between the first silencing device and the second 
silencing device. The object of the present invention is that of 
providing a system of the above indicated type which 
allows a substantial reduction of the volume of the 
catalytic converter and/or the silencing devices, while 
the global efficiency of the system remains the same. In order to achieve this object, the invention 
provides a system of the above indicated type, 
characterized in that at least part of said exhaust 
manifold tubes, said flexible tubing and said 
connecting tubes have a construction such that they 
also constitute a silencing means. In a preferred embodiment, one or more connecting 
tubes of the system have a tube body with two end 
portions and a central portion which is enlarged with 
respect to the end portions, and an inner tubular 
element arranged through said tube body and forced  
 
within the end portions of the latter, so as to define 
an annular chamber between the enlarged central portion 
of the tube body and the inner tubular element, said 
inner tubular element having a partition wall which is 
transverse to the axis of the tubular element and 
defines a first and a second chambers separate from 
each other within said inner tubular element, said 
inner tubular element having perforated walls, so that, 
in operation, the exhaust gasses which enter into the 
tube flow from said first chamber of the inner tubular 
element to said annular chamber through the holes of 
the inner tubular element, and from said annular 
chamber to the second chamber of the inner tubular 
element, again through the holes of the inner tubular 
element, whereupon they can flow out of the tube. Due to said features, the tube is able to fulfil a 
silencing function in addition to that performed by the 
conventional silencing devices, so that the latter may 
have a reduced bulk while keeping the global efficiency 
of the silencing system the same. Preferably, the body of the tube with said central
