Method for providing protection against oxidation for a product made 
of a composite material containing carbon and having a ceramic surface, said 

protection being provided by at least one liquid composition capable of leaving a 
refractory residue that is non-oxidizing and self-healing, the method being 

characterized in that it comprises at least the steps consisting in: 

forming on the ceramic surface of the product at least one external 
coating by means of a composition mainly containing a mixture of phosphates, of 

silica, and of alumina, and belonging to a P₂O₅ - SiO₂ - Al₂O₃ system; and 
after drying, performing heat treatment at a temperature that is 
sufficient at least to transform the external coating into an insoluble cement 

capable of forming a self-healing glass. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the external coating 
is formed by spray-painting a liquid suspension containing said mixture of 

phosphates, of silica, and of alumina. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the external coating 
is formed by using a brush to apply a liquid suspension containing said mixture of 

phosphates, of silica, and of alumina. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that in 
the mixture of phosphates, of silica, and of alumina, the ratio by weight of SiO₂ 

over P₂O₅ lies in the range 0.35 to 0.45, the ratio by weight of Al₂O₃ over P₂O₅ 

lies in the range 0.40 to 0.55, and the ratio by weight of SiO₂ over Al₂O₃ lies in 
the range 0.6 to 1. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
composition also contains refractory oxides. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
heat treatment is continued at a higher temperature to transform the insoluble 

cement into a self-healing glass. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
heat treatment is performed at a temperature that is sufficient to transform the 

external coating into a self-healing glass. 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
prior to forming the external coating, it comprises a step that consists in 

impregnating the product to the core within the residual open pores of the 
composite material by means of a liquid solution of at least one alkali phosphate.  

 
Method according to claim 8, characterized in that it includes 
implementing heat treatment at a temperature that is sufficient for the surfaces of 

the pores in the impregnated composite material to be lined with an internal 
protective coating that is refractory, non-oxidizing, and self-healing. 
Method according to any one of claims 8 and 9, characterized in that 
the product is impregnated to the core by means of a liquid solution of phosphates 

of sodium and of potassium. 
Product made of a composite material containing carbon and protected 
against oxidation by an external coating that is refractory and non-oxidizing, 

characterized in that the coating is constituted by a cement that is insoluble in 
water and that is formed on the basis of a mixture of phosphates, of silica, and of 

alumina. 
Product made of a composite material containing carbon and protected 
against oxidation by a vitreous external coating that is self-healing, the product 

being characterized in that the coating is constituted by an inverse glass of silica 
formed on the basis of a mixture of phosphates, of silica, and of alumina. 
Product made of composite material according to any one of claims 11 
and 12, characterized in that it further includes internal protection against 

oxidation formed on the basis of a mixture of phosphates of sodium and of 
potassium.
