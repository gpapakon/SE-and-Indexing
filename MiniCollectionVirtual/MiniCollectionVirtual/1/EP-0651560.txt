<ABSTRACT>
A hyperacuity printing system for rendering halftoned image data on a recording 
medium (14; Fig.1). The system includes a data source (51) for supplying grayscale input image 

data and a writing device (15) for writing grayscale output image data onto the recording 
medium. Also included is halftoning circuitry (70) for transforming the grayscale input image 

data into the grayscale output image data, the halftoning circuitry including a look-up table 
(72) for providing the grayscale output image data described as halftone dots arranged as a 

continuum from a lowest intensity value to a highest intensity value of the grayscale input 
image data. Finally, included is an intensity modulating 

device (76) coupled between the halftoning 
circuitry (70) and the writing device (15) for converting the grayscale output image data from 

the halftoning circuitry (70) into a form which can be utilized by the writing device (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to halftoning, and more particularly, to a hyperacuity printing system
according to the preamble of claim 1.A hyperacuity printing system similar to the one according to the preamble of claim 1 is
derivable from US 4 985 779.Various optical and electronic techniques have been proposed for transforming continuous
tone and other types of variably shaded monochromatic and polychromatic images (collectively
referred to herein as "toneart images") into halftone images. To simplify this disclosure, substantial
portions of the following discussion focus on monochromatic halftoning, but it is to be understood that
the same general teachings apply to the halftoning of the color separations of polychromatic images.
The halftoning of black and white "grayscale" images is a convenient example of monochromatic
halftoning, so it is noted that the term "grayscale" is used herein as a generic descriptor for the tones
that can be produced by mixing any two reference colors together in any desired proportions.As is known, a halftone image is a binary image that is composed by writing "halftone dots"
into a spatially periodic, two dimensional, tiled array of dimensionally identical "halftone cells." These
halftone cells spatially correspond in the halftoned output image to respective small, spatially distinct
areas of the source image. Furthermore, the surface area of the dot that is written into each of the
halftone cells is modulated in accordance with a suitable measure of the perceived or "average"
grayscale level of the spatially corresponding area of the source image (this "dot area" parameter
typically is expressed by referring to the percentage of the halftone cell area that is filled by the
halftone dot that is written therein). Thus, halftoning imparts an illusion of shading to the halftoned
image because the halftone dots are written at a spatial frequency (usually called the "screen
frequency") that exceeds the cyclical acuity of the human eye at normal viewing distances (a
conservative rule of thumb is that the human eye is insensitive to cyclical contrast variations that occur
at a spatial frequency in excess of about 40 cycles per degree within the field of view).As will be appreciated, halftoning is an important tool for preserving the shaded appearance
of toneart images that are printed using binary printing technologies. Optically screened lithographic
halftoning processes have established a challenging benchmark for the imaging fidelity that can be
achieved by printing halftoned
