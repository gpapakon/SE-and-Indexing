A process for producing hollow-spherical alkali 
metal polyphosphates of low bulk density by spraying 

aqueous alkali metal orthophosphate solutions by 
means of single-component nozzles at upstream 

pressures of the alkali metal phosphate solutions 
from 6 to 40 bar in a spray tower through a flame 

zone, which comprises spraying the alkali metal 
orthophosphate solutions together with the aqueous 

solution of an expanding agent, a permanent gas 
pressurised to a higher pressure than that of the 

two agueous solutions being forced in the form of 
fine bubbles into a turbulence zone which is filled 

with these solutions and flow-connected to the 
single-component nozzles. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein urea is 
used as the expanding agent. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
phosphorus compounds of low valency are used as the 

expanding agent. 
The process as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
phosphorous acid and/or salts thereof are used is 

the phosphorus compounds of low valency. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein alkali 
metal carbonates and/or bicarbonates are used as the 

expanding agent.  
 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein compressed air is used as the 

permanent gas. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein carbon dioxide is used as the 

permanent gas. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 

to 5, wherein nitrogen is used as the permanent gas. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 8, wherein the pressure of the permanent gas is 

at least 20 % higher than the upstream pressure of 
the alkali metal phosphate solutions. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 9, wherein 1.5 to 40 m³(S.T.P.) of permanent gas 

are applied per m³ of alkali metal phosphate 
solution. 
The process as claimed in claim 10, wherein 2 to 6 
m³(S.T.P.) of permanent gas are applied.
