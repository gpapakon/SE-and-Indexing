<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to antigens which are protective against, inter alia,
Echinococcus granulosus infection, to vaccines containing such antigens and to
methods of protecting hosts susceptible to Echinococcus and Taenii parasite
infection.Hydatid disease is caused by infection with the larval (metacestode stage) of
tapeworms belonging to the genus Echinococcus. Transmission occurs in predator-prey
mammalian cycles between carnivorous definitive hosts and herbivorous or
omnivorous intermediate hosts.Of Echinococcus tapeworms, Echinococcus granulosus is the most significant.
E.granulosus is the cause of cystic hydatid disease (CHD) and is typified by
transmission between the domestic dog and domestic herbivores such as sheep and
cattle, with humans also being intermediate hosts, but not normally contributing to
the life cycle. As a consequence, E.granulosus is geographically widespread and its
distribution closely parallels the areas of the world where pastoralism is the main
occupation. Therefore, it will be appreciated that CHD is an important endemic
disease over large parts of South America, Africa, Australasia, Central Europe,
Central Asia and the Mediterranean littoral including North Africa.Some countries are now attempting control of CHD through education of
the dog owner and regular anthelmintic treatment of the dog as definitive host.
However, while such programmes have generally been partially successful,
eradication has proved more difficult to achieve.A further desirable approach to control of CHD involves the use of a
vaccine against acquisition of the cystic stage of the life cycle of E. granulosus by
the intermediate host. This approach has the considerable advantage that
transmission of the infection to dogs through consumption of cyst-containing offal
from the intermediate host is prevented. As a consequence, eradication of the
disease becomes a realistic possibility.It is broadly to the vaccine approach that the present invention is directed.However, for a commercial vaccine to be developed, it is essential for
specific protective antigens against E. granulosus to be identified. While
investigations to date (Gemmell M A, Immunology11 325-335 (1966); Heath etal., J Parasitol67 (6) 797-799 (1981)) have clearly shown that the oncosphere of E.
granulosus is a potent source of such antigens, no specific E. granulosus oncosphere
antigens have been identified as conferring protection.International Patent Application No. PCT/FR91/00563 (published as WO
92/01051) discloses an immunogenic E.
