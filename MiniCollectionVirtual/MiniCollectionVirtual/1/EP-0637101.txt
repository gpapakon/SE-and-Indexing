<ABSTRACT>
The front section (2) of the waterproof plug (1) has an 
opening (10) of a small diameter, and its rear section (8) 

has an opening of a large diameter. When the waterproof 
plug (1) is placed over the wire with its conductor (94) 

exposed by stripping the insulation (92) from the end of 
the wire, the small diameter opening (10) and the large 

diameter opening (12) fit tightly over the conductor (94) 
and the insulation (92), respectively. A pin contact (40) 

is attached to the wire tip (96) by crimping, and the 
waterproof plug (1) is retained between the crimping 

section (46) of the pin contact (40) and the insulation 
(92) of the wire (90).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to waterproof plugs and wire
terminals with waterproof plugs and, more especially, to a waterproof
plug attached to the insulated portion of a wire
connected to a contact and to wire terminal with
a waterproof plug.A number of methods for creating waterproof
structures by attaching a waterproof plug to a wire for
waterproof connectors is known in the art. For the best
known type of such structures among waterproof plugs one
can refer to the waterproof plug described in JP Utility
Model No.5 17958. This waterproof plug is a cylindrical
body with several circular rings, and its front
cylindrical portion is fixed to the wire end over its
insulation as a contact insulation barrier. The main
disadvantage of the waterproof plug of such a type is the
necessity to use a crimping process, otherwise the contact
will not have an insulation barrier.Another conventional example of a waterproof plug
retaining structure is shown in Fig. 5 of the accompanying drawings. This retaining
structure, which is fully described in JP utility model No. 5-31144 consists of a roughly cylindrical waterproof
plug 100 having several circular ribs 101 placed over wire
90". It is retained over the wire 90" by means of
retaining devices 106, 116 located at both ends 102, 104
of the plug. Retaining device 106 has a flange-type
expanded retaining section 108 which is pressed against
the end surface 102 and an insulation barrier 110 which is
crimped over the wire 90". Retaining device 116 has a
retaining section 118, of the same shape as the retaining
section 108, which is pressed against the end surface 104
of the waterproof plug 100 and a crimped section 120 of a
solderless contact connected to the wire 90". The
waterproof plug 100 is fixed to the wire 90" by being
sandwiched between the two retaining devices 106 and 116.
This retaining structure requires several assembly 
operations to attach the plug to the wire 90". In
addition, this design is not suitable for high density
assemblies, since the retaining sections 108,118 expand
outward. Another problem is the large number of
components.The purpose of this invention is to provide a
waterproof plug for a wire terminal, which plug is of
a simple design, suitable for high-density assembly and
comprises a small number of components.The invention consists in a waterproof plug
attached to an insulated wire connected to a first
contact for preventing water from getting into the
receptacle cavity of a second contact to which the
first contact is connected, characterized
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A waterproof plug (1,1') attached to an
insulated wire (90,90') connected to a first contact

(40, 40') for preventing water from getting into the
receptacle cavity of a second contact to which the

first contact is connected,

   characterized in that the plug (1,1') has an
opening (10,10') of a small diameter in its front

portion (2,2') and an opening (12,12') of a larger
diameter in its rear portion (8,8') and, when the plug

(10,10') is placed over an end (96a) of the wire
(90,90') which end is stripped of insulation, these

small and larger diameter openings fit tightly over the
conductor (94,94') and insulation (92,92'),

respectively.
The plug of claim 1, wherein the small and
larger diameter openings are connected by a tapered

surface (14) which is shaped to fit an end surface (96)
of said insulation.
The plug of claim 1 or 2, wherein the front
portion (2') is joined to the rear portion (8') by a

tubular portion (20) which is molded into the front
portion (8').
The plug of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the front
and rear portions (2,8) are made from different

synthetic materials.
The plug of any preceding claim,
wherein the front portion (2,2')

is trapped between an end of the first contact (40,40')
and the wire insulation (92,92').
