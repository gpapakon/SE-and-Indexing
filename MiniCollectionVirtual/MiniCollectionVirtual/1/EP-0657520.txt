<ABSTRACT>
A safe antioxidant applicable to foods, medicines, quasi-drugs, and other products. The antioxidant contains an active ingredient 
comprising an antioxidizing substance alone or a mixture thereof with an oxidation inhibitor, said antioxidizing substance 

being selected from the group consisting of decomposition products of lactoferrins, peptides isolated from the above decomposition 
products, synthetic peptides each having the same amino acid sequence as that of any of the above peptides, and 

arbitrary mixtures of these compounds. This antioxidant has an excellent effect of inhibiting the oxidation of various lipids, is extremely 
safe for foods and drugs, and exhibits an antioxidant effect even in a small amount, so that it scarcely affects the taste, 

etc., of food or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antioxidant. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a safe antioxidant
applicable for food, drug medicine, non-medical drug and other
products.Oils and fats are oxidized by oxygen contained in the
atmosphere, thus producing peroxides. Peroxides are relatively
unstable and further produce carbonyl and other compounds through
polymerization and decomposition. These carbonyl and other
compounds form major ingredients causing bad odor.Peroxides and other compounds such as carbonyl cause
deterioration of flavor and degradation of quality of oils and
fats, and in addition, these peroxides, when absorbed, exert
detrimental effects in vivo. In an experiment in which a large
dose of a lipid peroxide was administered to animals during a
short period of time, peroxide have been clarified to induce
troubles in the liver function and the immune system.Oxidation reactions in vivo are known to relate to aging
and various diseases. More specifically, active oxygen produced
in vivo oxidizes lipid rich in unsaturated fatty acid, causes
progress of radical linkage peroxidizing reaction, and produces
peroxidized lipid such as lipid hydroperoxide. Decomposition of
lipid hydroperoxide produces active oxygen species such as highly
reactive alkoxy radical, peroxy radical, and singlet oxygen, thus
causing progress of linkage reactions.Free radicals and active oxygen species generated in the
course of oxidation reaction denature protein in vivo, inactivate
enzymes, bring about mutation in DNA, and finally cause various
diseases including aging and cancer. Many substances are known to have antioxidant action,
including for example certain amino acids [Marcuse, R.: Nature,
Vol. 188, p. 866, 1960], protein having a metal chelating function
(Kajimoto and Yoshida: Yukagaku, Vol. 21, p. 200, 1972),
dipeptide (Yamaguchi, et al.: Journal of the Japan Food Industry
Association, Vol. 22, p. 425, 1975), and a certain peptide
available by enzymatic decomposition of egg albumin (Tsuge, et
al.: Journal of the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan, Vol.
65, p. 1635, 1991).Regarding lactoferrins which are natural iron-binding
proteins contained in lacrima, saliva, peripheral blood, and milk
of mammals, there is known the inhibiting effect of generation of
iron-dependent peroxidized lipid [Gutteridge, J.M.C., et al.:
Biochemical Journal, Vol.199, p.259, 1981], and an anti-aging
food product based on blending of lactoferrin is proposed
(Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No.
