<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field medicinal chemistry. In
particular, the invention relates to the use of modified saponins for
enhancing drug delivery across mucosal membranes of an animal. The
modified saponins of the present invention exhibit significantly reduced
irritation to mucosal membranes compared to the natural saponins.It is known that certain small peptides can be absorbed through the
nasal mucosa as a "snuff" or directly from aqueous solution. Gordon, G.S.
et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 :7419-7423 (1985). However, the
efficacy of absorption is typically low and variable and therapeutically
important peptides of larger molecular size, such as insulin, are not
absorbed to any appreciable degree. Hirai et al, Diabetes 27:296-299
(1978).A number of researchers have attempted to enhance the delivery
of polypeptides with detergents. For example, Gordon, G.S. et al, Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:7419-7423 (1985), report that the nasal absorption
of insulin can be enhanced by hydrophobic bile salts.Longenecker, J.P. et al, J. Pharm. Sci. 76:351-355 (1987), disclose
that sodium taurodihydrofusidate is an effective enhancer of mucosal
permeation of drugs, in particular, insulin.Morimoto, K. et al, J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 37:134-136 (1984),
disclose that the nasal absorption of insulin and calcitonin may be
enhanced with polyacrylic acid gel.See also Moses, A. C. et al, Diabetes 32:1040-1047 (1983), who
disclose the administration of insulin as part of an insulin-bile salt aerosol;
and Aungst, B. J. et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 244:23-27 (1988), who 
compared the nasal, rectal, buccal, sublingual and intramuscular insulin
efficacy and the effects of a bile salt absorption promoter.Maitani, Y. et al, Drug Design Del. 1:65-70 (1986), disclose the
intranasal administration of β-interferon with and without surfactants
(non-ionic, anionic and amphoteric). When no surfactant was used,
β-interferon was not absorbed in rabbits. Sodium glycocholate was the
most effective in enhancing the absorption of interferon following nasal
administration. However, the total absorption of β-interferon with sodium
glycocholate was 2.2% of the total absorption by intravenous
administration.Other detergents which have been employed to enhance the uptake
of polypeptides by mucosal tissue include saponins. Saponins occur widely
in plant species (over 400) and exhibit a range of biological properties,
some of which are beneficial and some deleterious. When agitated in
water, they form a soapy lather and it is this
