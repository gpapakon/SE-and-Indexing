<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing organic and inorganic
hydroxides or alkoxides and for improving the purity of organic and inorganic
hydroxides or alkoxides. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of
improving the purity of quaternary ammonium hydroxides. The invention also relates
to the high purity hydroxides and alkoxides obtained by the method of the invention.Quaternary ammonium hydroxides such as tetramethylammonium
hydroxide (TMAH) and tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEAH) are strong organic
bases that have been known for many years. Such quaternary ammonium hydroxides
have found a variety of uses including use as a titrant for acids in organic solvents
and as a supporting electrolyte in polarography. Aqueous solutions of quaternary
ammonium hydroxides, particularly TMAH solutions, have been used extensively as
a developer for photoresists in printed circuit board and microelectronic chip
fabrication. Use of quaternary ammonium hydroxides in the electronics area requires
that there be no residue following the normal post-bake period. In electronic
applications, it is desirable that the aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium 
hydroxides should be essentially free from metal ions such as sodium, potassium, zinc
and calcium; anions such as halides, nitrates, nitrites, carbonates, carboxylates,
sulfates and neutral organic species such as methanol, amines, etc. Particularly in
recent years, there has been an increasing demand for quaternary ammonium
hydroxides having a high purity.Quaternary ammonium hydroxides such as TMAH and TEAH have
been produced by various techniques. Generally, the quaternary ammonium
hydroxides are manufactured by electrolyzing a salt of a quaternary ammonium
compound in an electrolysis cell containing a diaphragm formed of a cation-exchange
membrane. The quaternary ammonium salts used in such preparations include halide
salts, carboxylate salts, carbonate salts and sulfate salts. When halide salts are used
in the manufacture of quaternary ammonium hydroxide, it has been discovered that
the quaternary ammonium hydroxide solutions formed by this method generally
contain significant amounts of halogen (ionic and latent), generally in concentrations
from about 30 ppm up to about 100 ppm at 25% quaternary ammonium hydroxide
(e.g., TMAH). The term "latent halide" is used throughout this specification and
claims to refer to non-ionic halogen which is present in the aqueous quaternary
ammonium hydroxide solutions, and which is capable of forming halide
