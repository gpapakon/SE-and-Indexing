<ABSTRACT>
According to the prior art, it is known to damp noise emissions by means of "antisound". In exhaust gas systems of internal combustion engines this is mostly implemented by subjecting the exhaust gas stream flowing past in the exhaust gas system with "antisound" emitted by loudspeakers (12). However, arrangements of this type have the disadvantage that the hot exhaust gases flowing past reduce the lifetime of the loudspeakers, or measures of this type for active silencing operate only inadequately. According to the invention, an arrangement is therefore described which avoids the disadvantages arising from the prior art. According to the invention, this is realised in that the exhaust gas pipe (10) opens into one of the two chambers of a double-chamber box (17) and a bass reflex pipe (21) projects into this chamber of the double-chamber box (17). The outstanding cancellation of sound at low loudspeaker power is effected by the cancellation of sound being carried out in the chamber of the box (17) into which the ends of the bass reflex pipe (21) and of the exhaust gas pipe (10) open, and by the beam axis S intersecting the centre line M at a distance A between the two pipes (10, 21) or in the pipe (21), and the length of separation L between partition (18) and centre line M being a maximum of 75% of the greatest diametral extent of the loudspeaker (12).

Active sound-damping system for exhaust systems, having 
at least one loudspeaker (12), that is mounted in the 

baffle (18) of a loudspeaker enclosure (17) operating 
according to the twin-chamber principle, the one volume 

formed by the baffle (18) being provided with a sound 
outlet opening (20) in which a pipe (21) is inserted, and 

having an exhaust pipe (10) which ends in the volume 
formed by the baffle (18), which volume is provided with 

a sound outlet opening (20), whereby the opposing ends of 
the two pipes (10, 21) which share the same centre line 

M, at least in the region of their openings (22), are 
separated by a distance A,
characterised in that
 
the baffle (18) is arranged so that the acoustic axis S 

of a loudspeaker (12) mounted in the baffle (18) 
intersects the part of the centre line M which runs 

outside the region of the opening (22) of the exhaust 
pipe (10), and that the distance E between the region of 

the baffle (18) in which the loudspeaker (12) is 
arranged, and the point of intersection of the acoustic 

axis S of the loudspeaker (12) and the centre line M, 
does not exceed 75 % of the largest dimension of the 

loudspeaker diameter. 
Active sound-damping system according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 

the acoustic axis S and the centre line M enclose an 
angle Î± of between 20 and 90 degrees. 
Active sound-damping system according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 
the distance E is equal to the radius of the largest 

dimension of the loudspeaker diameter. 
Active sound-damping system according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
  
 

the pipe (21) inserted into the sound outlet opening (20) 
is a bass reflex pipe and that together with its end 

facing away from the enclosure (17), the bass reflex pipe 
(21) forms the complete end of the exhaust system. 
Active sound-damping system according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 
the distance A does not exceed 3 centimetres.
