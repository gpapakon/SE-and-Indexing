<ABSTRACT>
A camera mount having drag mechanisms which are controlled electronically, as by applying a control signal to a transducer or cell able to convert the applied signal into a force. In an embodiment, the mount (10) has a manual or servo actuator (12) which incorporates an electrorheological cell. The electric field across the cell is controlled by application of a voltage signal (15) derived from a control signal (18) which is adjustable to enable the torque-versus-speed characteristic of the mount to be selected for both pan and tilt.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title Camera MountField of the inventionThis invention relates generally to camera mounts, and in particular to mounts for cinematograph and television cameras equipped with pan and tilt controls. For convenience such a camera is referred to hereinafter simply as a TV camera.Background to the inventionTV cameras are mounted in such a way that the camera can be freely rotated about a vertical axis to enable pan motion and freely rotated about a horizontal axis to enable tilt motion. The resistance to pan and tilt motions is known as the drag.In some TV camera mounts, the drag is variable by means of an external adjuster over a limited range sufficient to accommodate different types and weights of camera which may be fitted to the mount, production requirements and individual requirements of the camera operative.Drag adjustment, when provided, is achieved by wholly mechanical mechanisms which either introduce or withdraw a fixed supplementary damping or vary frictional damping. The range of drag adjustment is determined by design, and is relatively small.Thus currently available TV camera mounts are relatively inflexible in that torque-versus-speed performanceSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

(determined by the drag) cannot be varied outside the predetermined limited range. Moreover, the drag cannot be readily adjusted to compensate for alterations in camera field of view, even though the torque-versus-speed performance required clearly varies with different fields of view.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved TV camera mount.The inventionAccording to the invention, there is provided a TV camera mount having a drag mechanism on at least one and preferably both of the pan and tilt axes, wherein the or each drag mechanism is controlled electronically.The invention may be achieved by a drag mechanism which comprises a transducer or cell which converts an electrical signal into a force. This force may be applied to the pan and/or tilt axis to create drag. The electronic drag mechanism may replace a mechanical drag control mechanism.Separate cells may enable pan and tilt drag to be independently controlled.Conveniently, the cell is provided in the head of the mount to which the camera attaches, in such a manner that the pan and tilt drag can be influenced, and an adjustable control signal is applied to the cell to adjust the properties of the cell in such a manner that a desired torque-versus-speed characteristic is obtained.SUBSTITUTE SHEET
