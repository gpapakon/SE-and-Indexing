<ABSTRACT>
An individual cigar dispenser comprises a drawer (11) which can only be drawn forwards by a slider (9) when a coin (21) has been received in the slider so as to engage the rear of the drawer and cause the drawer to move with the slider. Movement of the drawer lifts a front plate (19) of a cigar magazine (16) to disturb a store (17) of cigars to prevent jamming.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A COIN-OPERATED ARTICLE DISPENSERThe present invention relates to a coin-operated article dispenser of the kind in which the depositing of a coin in a slot in the dispenser enables a drawer mechanism to be pulled out to dispense an article.If such a dispenser is to be used mounted on a wall, counter or bar to dispense cheap articles such as individual cigars, it is desirable to make the mechanism of the dispenser as simple as possible.Previous attempts to provide a simple mechanism have included the use of a ratchet element, the teeth of which obstruct the opening of a drawer and which can be pushed out of the path of the drawer by a coin against the action of a return spring. The provision of the ratchet element and return spring increase the number of components in the system thereby increasing the cost and the possibility of failure of the mechanism.According to a first aspect of the present invention a coin-operated article dispenser comprises a housing which contains a magazine for holding a store of the articles, a drawer which is slidable beneath the magazine and has a recess for receiving an article under gravity from the store, a slider which can be pulled forwards adjacent to, but independently of, the drawer, a coin chute for a designated denomination of coin and for directing the coin to a connecting position at which, with the drawer and slider retracted, the coin provides a connection between the slider and the drawer so that pulling the slider forwards carries the drawer with it to expose the recess outside the housing, whereupon the coin falls from its connecting position into a collection chamber.As the connection between the slider and the drawer is provided by the coin, the drawer is released simply without the need for any further components.Despite the need for a simple mechanism it is still important that the articles in the magazine do not become 

 jammed in such a way that the drawer is opened without on of the articles having fallen into the recess.According to the second aspect of the presen invention a coin-operated article dispenser comprises housing which contains a magazine for holding a store o the articles, a drawer which is slidable beneath th magazine and which has a recess for receiving an articl under gravity from the store, and a coin-operated mechanis which is such that the depositing of a designate denomination of coin in a slot in the housing enables th drawer to be pulled forwards to expose the recess outsid the housing, wherein the magazine has a front or rear

1. A coin-operated article dispenser comprising a housing (3) which contains a magazine (16) for holding a store (17) of the articles, a drawer (11) which is slidable beneath the magazine and has a recess (12) for receiving an article (13) under gravity from the store, a slider (9) which can be pulled forwards adjacent to, but independently of, the drawer, a coin chute (5) for a designated denomination of coin (21) and for directing the coin to a connecting position at which, with the drawer and slider retracted, the coin provides a connection between the slider and the drawer so that pulling the slider forwards carries the drawer with it to expose the recess outside the housing, whereupon the coin falls from its connecting position into a collection chamber (25) .
2. A coin-operated article dispenser comprising a housing (3) which contains a magazine (16) for holding a store (17) of the articles, a drawer (11) which is slidable beneath the magazine and which has a recess (12) for receiving an article (13) under gravity from the store, and a coin- operated mechanism (5,22) which is such that the depositing of a designated denomination of coin in a slot (4) in the housing enables the drawer to be pulled forwards to expose the recess outside the housing, wherein the magazine has a front or rear wall (19) which is slidable in the upwards/downwards direction and which is cased to reciprocate in this direction to disturb articles in the store when the drawer is moved upon dispensing an article.
