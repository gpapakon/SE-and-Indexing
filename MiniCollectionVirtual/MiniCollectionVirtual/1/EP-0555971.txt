<ABSTRACT>
A process (and the resulting products) are disclosed which enable 
oxide superconductors such as REBa₂CU₃O
6+x
 to be melt processed on various 
substrates, including a silver substrate or within a silver sheath. The 

process comprises melting a precursor material in an oxygen pressure that 
is chosen to ensure that the melting point of the precursor is less than 

that of the substrate and then solidifying the melted precursor material. 
The solidified material is then fully oxygenated by contacting it with an 

atmosphere containing oxygen. The process is particularly suitable for 
making long lengths of superconducting wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a process for making 
superconductors with high critical current densities and with the 
products of this process. It is particularly suitable for making long 
lengths of superconducting wires. Since 1987, there has been a tremendous effort to develop YBa₂Cu₃O6+x 
(known as the "1-2-3" superconductor) and other superconducting oxides 
with superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) above the boiling point 
of liquid nitrogen into practical engineering materials. However, several 
basic materials problems have frustrated this effort. Superconducting oxides are brittle ceramics, which makes it 
difficult to form them into the flexible wires or tapes needed for many 
applications. Early on, researchers tried to circumvent this problem by 
using so-called "powder-in-tube" processing. In this process, the 
superconducting oxide is made into a powder and placed inside a metal 
tube. The tube is then drawn or rolled into a long wire and sintered at 
high temperature to form a continuous length of superconducting oxide 
within the metal sheath. A silver tube is typically used for power-in-tube 
processing of YBa₂Cu₃O6+x because silver is one of the few metals that 
does not react chemically with YBa₂Cu₃O6+x during high temperature 
processing. Moreover, oxygen diffuses fairly easily through silver. 
This is important because YBa₂Cu₃O6+x becomes a 90 K superconductor only 
when it is fully oxygenated (i.e., YBa₂Cu₃O6+x, with x between about 0.8 
and 1.0), which can be achieved by slowly cooling the material in oxygen 
following the last high temperature processing step. Prior powder-in-tube processing studies of YBa₂Cu₃O6+x are described 
in McCallum et al., Adv. Ceram. Mater., Vol. 2, 1987, page 388; Okada et 
al., Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 27, 1988, page L185; Okada et al., Jpn J. 
Appl. Phys., Vol. 27, 1988, page L1715; Ishii et al., Jpn. J. Appl. 
Phys., Vol. 28, 1989, page L1793; and Woolf et al., Appl. Phys. Lett., 
Vol 58, 1991, page 534.  Powder-in-tube processing did indeed produce flexible wires 
containing YBa₂Cu₃O6+x but the critical current density of these wires 
(i.e., the maximum current density that the material can carry and remain 
superconducting) was far too low to be useful (-10³ A/cm² at 77 K with no 
applied magnetic field). In addition, the critical current density 
dropped sharply when magnetic fields were applied. The low critical 
current density in sintered YBa₂Cu₃O6+x is caused by a second materials 
problem; namely, "weak links" at
