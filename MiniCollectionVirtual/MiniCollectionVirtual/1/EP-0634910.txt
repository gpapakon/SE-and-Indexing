<ABSTRACT>
A system for delivering radiofrequency energy to ablate cardiac tissue comprises a radiofrequency generator (18) and an intravascular catheter (12). The catheter includes both a radiofrequency ablation electrode (28) and a temperature sensor (30) within its distal end. Delivery of power to the ablation electrode may then be controlled based on electrode temperature using a cascade control system wherein analog temperature controller adjusts the set point to a secondary power controller. Alternatively, power delivered to the patient can be controlled directly based on a power set point. Reuse of the catheter is prevented by a fuse (34) within the catheter which is sensed prior to power delivery and broken prior to disconnection of the catheter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
field of electrophysiology. More particularly, this 
invention relates to an apparatus for treating 
cardiac arrhythmias. Symptoms of abnormal heart rhythm are generally 
referred to as cardiac arrhythmias, with an abnormally slow 
rhythm being classified as a bradycardia and an abnormally 
rapid rhythm being referred to as a tachycardia. The present 
invention is concerned with the treatment of tachycardias 
which are frequently caused by the presence of an 
"arrhythmogenic site" or "accessory atrioventricular 
pathway" close to the inner surface of one of the chambers 
of the heart. The heart includes a number of normal 
pathways which are responsible for the propagation of 
signals necessary for the normal electrical function. The 
presence of arrhythmogenic sites or accessory pathways can 
bypass or short circuit the normal pathways, potentially 
resulting in very rapid heart contractions, referred to as 
tachycardias. Tachycardias may be defined as ventricular 
tachycardias (VT's) and supraventricular tachycardias 
(SVT's). VT's originate in the left or right ventricle and 
are typically caused by arrhythmogenic sites associated with 
a prior myocardial infarction. SVT's originate in the atria 
and are typically caused by an accessory pathway. Treatment of both ventricular and supraventricular 
tachycardias may be accomplished by a variety of approaches, 
including drugs, surgery, implantable 
pacemakers/defibrillators, and catheter ablation. While 
drugs may be the treatment of choice for many patients, they 
only mask the symptoms and do not cure the underlying cause.  
 
Implantable devices only correct the arrhythmia after it 
occurs. Surgical and catheter-based treatments, in 
contrast, will actually cure the problem, usually by 
ablating the abnormal arrhythmogenic tissue or accessory 
pathway responsible for the tachycardia. The catheter-based 
treatments rely on the application of various destructive 
energy sources to the target tissue, including direct 
current electrical energy, radiofrequency electrical energy, 
laser energy, and the like. Of particular interest 
are radiofrequency ablation protocols which have proven to 
be highly effective in tachycardia treatment while exposing 
the patient to minimum side effects and risks. Radiofrequency catheter ablation is generally 
performed after an initial mapping procedure where the 
location of the arrhythmogenic sites and accessory pathways 
are determined. After mapping, a catheter having a
