<ABSTRACT>
A glass/plastic laminate (12, 14, 16) useful in glazing applications which has improved optical quality is provided by controlling the incidence of optical defects induced during manufacture by particulate contaminants by applying a soft plastic film (10) to the outboard side of the plastic surface (12) of the laminate and entrapping such contaminants during the lamination process in the soft plastic film (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The preparation of glass/plastic laminates
for use in safety glazing applications presents
unusually stringent manufacturing requirements in
order to provide a product which exhibits acceptable
optical quality.Typically, glass/plastic laminates are
produced in the following manner. A plastic composite
having an adhesive side is placed onto a receiving
glass sheet. A similarly shaped sheet of glass or
rigid coverplate in placed over the surface of the
composite. A vacuum is applied to the assembly or the
assembly is pre-pressed to exclude air from between
the layers. The assembly is them placed in an
autoclave where lamination is completed by application
of heat and pressure. In this operation the composite
bonds to the glass, and the outboard surface of the
composite is molded to replicate the surface of the
coverplate.Unfortunately, the resulting glass/plastic
laminates do not always possess the desired optical
qualities. During the bonding step any contaminating
material between the coverplate and the surface of the
plastic composite remains as a contaminant on the
surface of the composite and may become embedded in
the surface of the composite. After cooling,
depressurization and coverplate removal, the
contaminant leaves permanent, objectionable optical
defects in the laminated structure. Damage done by
very small particles can be observed by the naked eye.
The visibility threshold for particles is typically 10 
to 25 micrometers in diameter. However, a particle 3 to 5 micrometers in diameter can
cause a visible defect in a glass/plastic laminate. Removal of the particles from the surface
of the laminate after formation of the laminate does not cure the defect since the visual
imprints made by the particles, i.e. depressions, remain on the plastic surface.Efforts to solve this problem by modifying the surface of the coverplate have not
been entirely successful. Obtaining optimum optical quality has required labor intensive
cleaning procedures usually involving an expensive clean room atmosphere.It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a process for
producing laminates of improved optical quality. A further object is to provide
glass/plastic laminates in which optical defects resulting from contaminants which may
become embedded in the surface of the laminate during autoclaving or in other
pressure/temperature processes are substantially eliminated without resorting to expensive
clean room facilities and labor-intensive cleaning procedures.In a first aspect the present
