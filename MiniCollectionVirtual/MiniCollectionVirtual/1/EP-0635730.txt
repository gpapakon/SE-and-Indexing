<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a dynamic-hologram speedometer, including a coherent light source (1) delivering a light beam (F1) of frequency f1 separated by a plate (2) into a beam (F2) for illuminating an animate object having a radial speed Vr and into a pump beam (F3), means for mixing the beam (F4) backscattered by the object and the pump beam (F3) including a photorefractive interaction medium (5). In the interaction medium 5, a spatial modulation of light intensity induces a dynamic hologram written in a refractive-index grating (R).   The pump beam (F3) passes through frequency-shift means (4) before interfering with the backscattered beam (F4) in the interaction of medium (5). The speedometer includes a source of coherent pulse light (7) emitting a read beam (F5) towards the interaction medium (5). For the read beam to be deflected by the index grating and detected by detection means (10), the frequency-shift means (4) are set so that the frequency difference between the pump beam (F3) and the reflected beam (F4) interfering in the interaction medium (5) is less than a predetermined value. Application to the measurement of speed of moving objects on the basis of the frequency shift experienced by the pump beam.
