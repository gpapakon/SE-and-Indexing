<ABSTRACT>
Self-adhesive carbonaceous grains for use in the 
manufacture of high-density and high-strength carbon 

artifacts containing 0.5 - 1.5 wt% of a quinoline-soluble 
but pyridine-insoluble component and at least 97 wt% of 

a quinoline-insoluble component and which are prepared 
by heat-treating in a nonoxidizing atmosphere a mesophase 

pitch that is obtained by polymerizing condensed polycyclic 
hydrocarbons or substances containing them in the presence 

of a superacid consisting of hydrogen fluoride and boron 
trifluoride. The carbonaceous grains are molded and the 

mold is baked at a sufficient temperature to achieve its 

carbonization, with the heating rate being not more than 
20°C/h in the temperature range from 400 to 600°C. In this 

way, high-density and high-strength carbon artifacts showing 
a homogeneous fine mosaic texture of optical anisotropy can 

be efficiently manufactured in high carbon yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates
to a process for producing high-density and high strength
carbon artifacts showing a fine mosaic texture of optical
anisotropy from self-adhesive carbonaceous grains. More
particularly, the invention relates to a process for
producing high-density and high-strength carbon artifacts
characterized by random arrangement of optically anisotropic
units at the submicron level.Many approaches have heretofore been known in the
manufacture of high-density carbon artifacts. They are
generally produced by mixing fillers such as pulverized
coke, natural graphite and carbon black with binders such
as coal-tar pitch, molding the mixture and baking the
mold. The carbonization yield of the conventional binder
is very low and the density of the mold achieved by single
carbonization is accordingly very low; therefore, the steps
of impregnation and carbonization must be repeated until the
desired properties are attained. As a further problem, the
major light-weight components of the binder will evaporate
during the carbonization to form pores that remain in the
mold; such pores will introduce inhomogeneity in the mold.
Additionally, structure disruption may be caused by the
bloating of the binder. To avoid these adverse effects,
the carbonization step must be performed by heating at
an extremely slow rate but then this increases the time
schedule of carbon artifact production to at least 3 - 4
weeks. The carbonized mold may be graphitized by further
heating at 2500 - 3000°C, depending on the use of the final
product. Besides, a period of 2 - 3 weeks is required to
perform this step of graphitization. In total, a period 
as long as 2 - 3 months is taken to manufacture graphitic
artifacts prepared from fillers (e.g. coke) and binders
(e.g. coal-tar pitch) through the above-described complex
route.As the demand for improvements in the performance
of specialty carbon artifacts and composites is growing year
by year, controlling the structure and texture of carbon
is extremely important for the purpose of enhancing the
performance of the final product since the physicochemical
characteristics of the product significantly depend on the
structure and texture of carbon. In the field of specialty
carbon artifacts, many R&D efforts have been made to control
the shape and size of starting grains so that the carbon
artifacts will exhibit fine mosaic texture, thereby
achieving not only higher density and strength but also
physical isotropy.A method is known to attain physical isotropy of
the artifact by using
