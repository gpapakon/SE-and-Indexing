<CLAIMS>
Transport protection for a glass or glass-ceramic 
plate which is brittle, sensitive to scratches and 

breaking and is to be integrated into a cooking appliance, 
in particular as a cooking area, characterized in 

that the transport protection, which is formed on one 
side, in the border and/or edge region and at the places 

on the plate which are not exposed to heat in operation, 
and which is composed of permanently flexible compounds 

containing silicone, such as silicone rubber and/or 
silicone resins, or of curable synthetic resins or of 

thermoplastic synthetic resins, is also permanently 
connected to the plate after transportation, during 

installation, assembly, in operation and during disassembly. 
Transport protection according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the transport protection is 

designed as assembly protection, a positioning aid, 
spacer, expansion-compensating medium and/or as a sealing 

element. 
Transport protection according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that, in the case of a glass or glass-ceramic 

plate provided with a profiling, by filling the 
profiling the transport protection creates a viewing 

window which has an outwardly facing smooth surface.
