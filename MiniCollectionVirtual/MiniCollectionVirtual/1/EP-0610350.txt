<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a hand-held aerosol dispenser for a liquid for use in inhalation therapy, the dispenser having, mounted in a casing, a spray nozzle designed to discharge compressed air, the dispenser also having a reservoir for the liquid. The liquid is aspirated, by the venturi principle, from the reservoir, through a channel leading to the vicinity of the nozzle and atomized into very fine droplets by a baffle element. The reservoir, which is sized to match the dimensions of the casing, is detachably housed in the lower part of the casing. Extending down from the channel leading to the vicinity of the nozzle is a flexible tube which passes through an aperture in the top of the reservoir and down to the vicinity of the bottom of the reservoir. The reservoir holds sterile water or a mixture of sterile water and medication.

Hand-held aerosol dispenser for therapeutic liquid for inhalation 
therapy having a nebulizer nozzle (4) arranged in a housing for the 

exit of compressed air, and with a storage container (6) for the 
liquid, wherein according to the Venturi-principle the liquid is taken 

in from the storage container (6) by means of a suction aperture 
(14) ending in a region of the nebulizer nozzle and is nebulized 

into very fine particles using an impact member (15) opposing the 
nebulizer nozzle (4), said storage container (6) corresponding in its 

dimensions to the size of the housing (1) is removably arranged in 
the lower region of the housing (1), wherein the channel ending in 

the region of the nebulizer nozzle (4) is extended downwardly by a 
suction tube (11), which extends through an upper aperture of the 

storage container (6) to the vicinity of the bottom (12) of the 
storage container (6), and wherein sterile water or a mixture of 

sterile water and medication is contained in the storage container 
(6)
