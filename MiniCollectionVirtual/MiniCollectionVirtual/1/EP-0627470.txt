<ABSTRACT>
A trisazo compound represented by the 
following formula (I) in the free acid form: 


wherein Q is an phenyl or naphthyl group both of which 
may be unsubstituted or substituted; one of the A and B 

is hydroxy group and the other is amino group; K is 1 or 
2; and one of m and n is 1 and the other is 0; a method 

for dyeing fiber materials, paper or leather by using 
the trisazo compounds and an ink containing the trisazo 

compounds, and the trisazo compound is excellent in 
solubility, and good in storage stability and free from 

clogging of nozzle caused by deposition. The ink using 
the trisazo compound gives a deep black-colored image 

excellent in clarity, water-durability and durability to 
light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to trisazo 
compounds and their use. More particularly, the present 
invention relate to trisazo compounds, a method for 
dyeing fiber materials, paper or leather by using 
the trisazo compounds and an ink containing the trisazo 
compounds. Polyazo direct or acid dyes prepared from 
benzidine or its derivatives have hitherto been used for 
dyeing fiber materials having hydroxy or amino group. 
However, production of benzidine used as a starting 
material of these dyes is prohibited, and benzidine 
derivatives exemplified by o-tolidine and dianisidine 
are resistered as special chemical substances of which 
handling is restricted in production of these dyes, 
because of their toxicity. For such a reason, a variety 
of compounds have been proposed as non-benzidine type 
dyes. However, none of them have yet satisfied the 
requirements of users in the dye abilities. C.I. Direct Black 168 represented by the 
following formula is also one proposed as a non-benzidine 
type dye. 
An ink containing the compound is mentioned in 
JP-A-88-105079. However, if used for dyeing fiber 
materials or paper, it cannot give a deep black color 
because of inferiority in build-up property. Further, 
it is unsatisfactory in solubility as a dye for an ink 
and it gives a recording image having insufficient 
water-durability. Particularly when used as an ink for 
ink jet process, it causes clogging of nozzle due to 
deposition of dye and gives a recording image having 
insufficient water-durability. Thus, it is unsatisfactory 
from the view point of performances in any uses. The object of the present invention is 
therefore to solve the above mentioned problem. This object has been achieved by the surprising 
finding of compounds capable of satisfying the necessary 
conditions of a dye and an ink and producible without 
using benzidine nor its derivative as a starting material. The present invention provides a trisazo 
compound represented by the following formula (I) in the 
free acid form: 
wherein Q is an phenyl or naphthyl group which may be  
 
substituted; one of the A and B is a hydroxy group and 
the other is an amino group; K is 1 or 2; and one of m 
and n is 1 and the other is 0. The present invention also provides a method 
for dyeing fiber materials, paper or leather by using 
the trisazo compound represented by the formula (I) and 
an ink containing the trisazo compound. When Q in the formula (I) is a phenyl group, 
the phenyl group is substituted or unsubstituted, though 
following (1)
