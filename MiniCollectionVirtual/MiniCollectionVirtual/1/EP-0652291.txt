<ABSTRACT>
A probe useful for rapidly detecting and identifying bacteria causative of infectious diseases is provided by completely digesting 
DNAs extracted from principal bacteria causative of infectious diseases with Hind III, cloning the digestion product to a 

suitable vector, and selecting a probe containing DNA fragments peculiar to each of the bacteria. A standard DNA sequence suitable 
for comparison with that of a genomic DNA contained in a clinical specimen is provided by clarifying the base sequence of 

the selected probe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to probes, prepared by making use of
causative bacteria of infectious diseases, which are useful for
detecting and identifying the causative bacteria.In pathology, infection is defined as invasion and establishment of a
foothold for growth in an organism by a pathogenic organism (hereinafter
referred to as "bacteria"), then the outbreak of disease depends upon
the interrelationship between the resistance of host and the virulence
of bacteria.In the infectious diseases, improvement in treatment methods of
bateremia have been raised as an important issue. That is to say,
bacteremia is not a disease caused by a particular bacterium, but is
caused by emergence and habitancy of the various bacteria in blood, then
onset thereof is clinically suspected when fever of about 40Â°C persists
for two or more days. If a patient is an infant or is suffering from
terminal cancer with weakened resistance, the patient may die in one or
two days, therefore, the bacteremia is a serious and urgent disease, and
the improvement in treatment methods thereof have been awaited.In the infectious disease, phagocytes including neutrophils, monocytes
and macrophages primarily work in defense of the body. Emergence of
bacteria in the blood is thought as invasion of predominant bacteria
which have emerged from the tissue of the phagocyte. Bacteremia is a state wherein the bacteria is emerged into the blood,
and a large amount of antibiotic is administrated to treat it wherein
the causative bacteria is sensitive to the antibiotic. Generally, since
antibiotics lower the functions of the internal organs such as liver, it
is necessary to pay an attention to reduce an administration of an
ineffective antibiotic to a patient in a serious state.When bacteremia is defined as a case wherein phagocytesis of cells can
not overcome the virulence of bacteria, then the bacteria spread in the
body through the blood, bacteremia with serious symptoms due to toxins
produced by the bacteria is called as sepsis. Proof of sepsis, in the
other word, establishment of the diagnosis requires a check on the items
of 1) clinical symptoms, 2) culturing of specimen, 3) gram-staining of
the bacteria contained in the specimen, and 4) shock state, then, upon
completing the check of these items, the treatment method is determined.
Accordingly, to quickly and reliably identify the bacteria have been
awaited in the art.In the present method for detecting and identifying bacteria in a
bacteremia-specimen, it is a common procedure to identify
