<ABSTRACT>
Cosmetic composition for the skin or skin appendages comprising a dispersion of solid particles in a binder and characterized in that at least a part of said particles is introduced into the composition in the form of particles having their surface coated with at least one amphoteric polymer. The coated particles are easily dispersible, even in fatty binders, and the cosmetic compositions have good stability properties and show good adhesion to the skin and skin appendages.

Cosmetic composition for the skin or the 
exoskeleton comprising a dispersion of solid particles in 

a binding agent, characterized in that at least a part of 
the said particles is introduced into the said 

composition in the form of particles whose surface is

or groups which can ionize to cationic groups, are chosen 
from those which contain primary, secondary, tertiary 

and/or quaternary amine groups. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said cationic groups, 

or groups which can ionize to cationic groups, are

Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the said anionic groups are 

carried by a side-chain substituent. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the said anionic and cationic  

 
groups are each carried by a side-chain substituent. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the ratio of cationic groups to 

anionic groups ranges from 40:60 to 90:10. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the weight proportion of 

amphoteric polymers in the coated particles is less than 
10% relative to the total weight of the coated particles, 

and preferably less than 8%. 
Composition according to the preceding claim, 
characterized in that the said proportion does not exceed 

2% by weight. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said coated particles 

comprise inorganic fillers or pigments. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the said coated particles 

comprise organic pigments or composite pigments with an 
organic coating. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the binding agent is chosen 

from fats (oils and/or waxes) and film-forming polymers. 
Composition according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it takes the form of a 

compact powder, a loose powder, a lipstick or a nail 
varnish. 
Composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 
13, characterized in that it takes the form of a water-in-oil 

or oil-in-water type emulsion. 
Use, in the preparation of a cosmetic composition 
for the skin or the exoskeleton containing a dispersion 

of solid particles in a binding agent, of particles whose 
surface is coated with at least one amphoteric polymer, 

the said amphoteric polymer containing both cationic and 
anionic groups and/or groups which can ionize to cationic 

groups and to anionic groups, respectively. 
Use according to the preceding claim, characterized 
in that the said cosmetic composition is as defined 

in any one of Claims 1 to 10.
