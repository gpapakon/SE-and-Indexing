<ABSTRACT>
A device for detecting infectious elements,
antibodies or other biological indicators of a

patient, in a dental surgery, envisages a container
(1) with a first channel (7) for the suction of a

quantity of fluid (F), from the patient, which gives
onto a second chamber (8) with a surface (6) equipped

with or soaked in reagent means (3) and/or means
which condition the infectious elements and are

designed to make contact with the fluid (F) sucked
up; the second chamber (8) can be connected inside a

first chamber (4) for depositing the mixture (F, 3)
thus obtained; the first chamber (4) for depositing

the mixture (F, 3) has detector means (5) designed to
allow a relative analysis and control of the mixture

(F, 3); the present invention also relates to a
method of detection which envisages the suction of a

fluid (F) from the patient through relative suction
means (2), mixing of the fluid (F) with reagent means

(3) and/or means which condition the biological
elements and depositing of the mixture (F, 3) thus

obtained in a special first chamber (4), there being
a second stage for analysis and control of the result 

of the reaction which took place in the mixture (F,
3) using relative detector means (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and device
for detecting elements, such as infectious elements,
or antibodies or other biological indicators, for the
medical diagnosis of a patient, in particular for use
in medical - dental surgeries and on/with dental
units.With reference to dental surgeries, which the present
invention targets in particular, the latest dental
units are of extremely high quality in terms of
operation, equipment control and, above all, the
hygiene of the internal and external functional
structures. This high quality is the result of the
ever increasing search for solutions that improve the
unit which, according to the Applicant, should be the
means which guarantee increasing support for the
patient and the dental surgeon who uses it, even in
diagnostics relating to infections which may be
transmitted during dental treatment or even before
treatment of a given complexity in the oral cavity. It is in this context that the manufacturers of
dental equipment in general are increasingly seeking
solutions which allow increasingly safe dental
surgeon - patient treatment. The recent devices for
disinfecting/sterilising dental handpieces, hydraulic
- pneumatic tubes (even between one patient and the
next), the use of "disposable" instruments or
accessories, etc. should be remembered.However, attention remains focused on some illnesses
for which medical opinion is now consolidated on
their transmissibility through haematic contact, such
as, an example to represent all such illnesses,
hepatitis C (HCV).Therefore, in order to check for the presence of
biological elements on patients treated (to guarantee
the safety of the treatment for both the patient and
the dental surgeon), the Applicant has designed a
method and device which rapidly and safely detects
such elements, referred to as biological in the
general sense, directly during dental treatment,
without obliging the patient to submit to specific
blood tests, but making use directly of the particles
of blood present in the oral cavity during normal
dental treatment, such as the removal of tartar or
normal treatment within the oral cavity. The technical features of the present invention, in
accordance with the above aims, are apparent in the
claims herein, and the advantages are more clearly
described in the detailed description below, with
reference to the accompanying drawings, which
illustrate an embodiment of the invention, without
limiting the scope of its application, and in which:
