<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/050,122, filed June 18,
1997.This invention relates to newly identified polynucleotides, polypeptides encoded by them
and to the use of such polynucleotides and polypeptides, and to their production. More
particularly, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention relate to G-protein
coupled receptor family, hereinafter referred to as H7TBA62. The invention also relates to
inhibiting or activating the action of such polynucleotides and polypeptides.It is well established that many medically significant biological processes are mediated by
proteins participating in signal transduction pathways that involve G-proteins and/or second
messengers, e.g., cAMP (Lefkowitz, Nature, 1991, 351:353-354). Herein these proteins are referred
to as proteins participating in pathways with G-proteins or PP.G proteins. Some examples of these
proteins include the GPC receptors, such as those for adrenergic agents and dopamine (Kobilka,
B.K., et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci., USA, 1987, 84:46-50; Kobilka, B.K., et al., Science, 1987,
238:650-656; Bunzow, J.R., et al., Nature, 1988, 336:783-787), G-proteins themselves, effector
proteins, e.g., phospholipase C, adenyl cyclase, and phosphodiesterase, and actuator proteins, e.g.,
protein kinase A and protein kinase C (Simon, M.I., et al., Science, 1991, 252:802-8).For example, in one form of signal transduction, the effect of hormone binding is activation
of the enzyme, adenylate cyclase, inside the cell. Enzyme activation by hormones is dependent on
the presence of the nucleotide, GTP. GTP also influences hormone binding. A G-protein connects
the hormone receptor to adenylate cyclase. G-protein was shown to exchange GTP for bound GDP
when activated by a hormone receptor. The GTP-carrying form then binds to activated adenylate
cyclase. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, catalyzed by the G-protein itself, returns the G-protein to its
basal, inactive form. Thus, the G-protein serves a dual role, as an intermediate that relays the signal
from receptor to effector, and as a clock that controls the duration of the signal.The membrane protein gene superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors has been
characterized as having seven putative transmembrane domains. The domains are believed to
represent transmembrane Î±-helices connected by extracellular or cytoplasmic loops. G-protein 
coupled receptors include a wide range of biologically active receptors, such as hormone, viral,
growth factor and
