<ABSTRACT>
A communication system between a programmable logic controller (10) and a network of a plurality of remote input/output repeater modules (12a-12c) uses a synchronous serial communications protocol. The programmable logic controller (10) contains a transmitter module (16) for generating a data packet (21) containing the state of an output device connected to a remote input/output repeater module (12a) coupled to the network. A receiver module (20) receives and decodes a returned modified data packet (30) that indicates the state of input devices connected to the same or other remote input/output repeater modules (12a-12c) also coupled to the network. The remote input/output (12a) repeater modules receive and decode the data packet to determine the state of the output devices that may be connected to it and modifies the data packet to indicate the state of its input device if there is one present. The modified data packet (30) is sent to the next in-line remote input/output repeater module (12a-12c) coupled to the network.

<DESCRIPTION>
Applicants' invention relates generally to
electrical control mechanisms and more particularly to a
network of single point input and output devices serially
connected to programmable logic controllers or other types
of microprocessor based devices that perform a number of
control functions.This patent is related to the following documents:
"Apparatus For Generating And Sending A Serial
Data Packet for Controlling A Network Of Single Point I/O
Devices" (US-A- 5,287,353), "Apparatus
For Receiving And Decoding A Serial Data Packet Containing
The Status Of A Network of Single Point I/O Devices"
(US-A-5,311,508) and "Apparatus for
Receiving And Modifying A Serial Data Packet From A
Communications Network To Indicate Its Status" (US-A-5,283,781).US-A-4 843 539 shows an information transfer system in which the communications
network is designed as a serial ring shift register.Input and output control modules for interfacing
with a programmable logic controller (PLC) that is normally
used to control a number of functions in a manufacturing
operation are well known. In most instances, these control
module assemblies are electrically interconnected in a rack
assembly with the PLC. This assembly is often of necessity
located on the plant floor at a distance from the machinery
used in the manufacturing operation to prevent physical
abuse from dirt, moisture, or vibration. Since many of the 
switches, pilot lights, control relays and so on are
located on the machinery, considerable wiring is required
to connect these devices to the PLC since each device
requires at least two wires between it and its respective
I/O point.Remote I/O control modules are available that can be
located in a rack assembly mounted directly on the
machinery. Whereas this will reduce the wiring
requirements, the additional rack assembly will require
adding a power supply and a remote network interface module
(NIM) that could be more costly. These assemblies are
generally bulky and require mounting space that may not be
available. Each device will still require a direct
connection to the remote I/O control module.The host PLC will also require a local NIM
Communications between the local and remote NIMs can become
complicated. Each device has an unique address. There
must be a means for each I/O point to know and set its
address location so that it can decode and select the data
meant for it from the various data packets sent over the
communication link by the PLC. It must also be able to
mark its data with its identity when it is being sent

A control system for transferring data between
microprocessor based devices (10, 12) connected on a

synchronous serial communications network (20)
comprising:


(a) a first microprocessor based device (10)
