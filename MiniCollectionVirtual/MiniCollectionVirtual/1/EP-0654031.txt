<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stereoselective process
for preparing nucleoside analogues and derivatives.
Particularly, the invention relates to a process for
preparing nucleoside analogues and derivatives that are
predominantly in their cis-isomer configuration.Nucleoside analogues and derivatives are an important
class of therapeutic agents. For example, a number of
nucleoside analogues have shown antiviral activity against
retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human T-lymphotropic virus
(HTLV) (PCT publication WO 89/04662 and European Patent
publication 0349242 A2). Among the nucleoside analogues
shown to have antiviral activity are 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine
(AZT), 2',3'-dideoxy-cytidine (ddC) and 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine
[(-)2-hydroxymethyl-5-(cytosin-1'-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane
(3TC)], (European Patent publication
0382526 A2). Oxathiolane nucleoside analogues and processes for their
preparation are also described in WO-A-92/10496, WO-A-91/11186,
EP-A-0 382 526, WO-A-93/03027, EP-A-0 526 253, WO-A-91/17159 and
EP-A-0 515 157.Most nucleoside analogues and derivatives contain at least two
chiral centers (shown as * in formula (A)), and each isomer can
exist in two pairs of optical isomers (enantiomers) (i.e., two
in the cis-configuration and two in the trans-configuration).
However, generally the cis-isomers exhibit useful biological
activity. 
Many of the known processes for producing nucleoside
analogues and derivatives rely on conventional
glycosylation procedures to add the sugar to the purine or
pyrimidine base. These procedures invariably give
diastereomeric mixtures of cis- and trans- isomers which
require tedious separation and result in lower yields of
the desired biologically active cis-nucleoside analogues.
Improved glycosylation methods designed to yield only the
cis-nucleoside require addition of an aryl or an acyl
substituent to the sugar preferably in the 2'- position.
Because the 2'-substituent is only useful in controlling
cis-nucleoside synthesis in one configuration (when the
2'-substituent is trans- to the 4'-substituent), multiple
steps are required to introduce this substituent in the
proper configuration. The 2'-substituent must be removed
after glycosylation, requiring additional steps.
