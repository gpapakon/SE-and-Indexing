<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a plastic
blow molding machine of the wheel type.In many wheel type blow molding machines of
the prior art, mechanical hardware, such as cams, are
utilized to control various aspects of the blow molding
operation, such as the opening and closing of the mold
halves. This type of mechanical hardware requires
frequent adjustments as these machines are operated to
fine tune operation and insure product quality.Typically, these adjustments are required from
the very first machine cycle and thereafter throughout
the life of the molding machine to compensate for
wearing of the cams, loosening of tolerances and the
like. These adjustments, however necessary, require the
operator to shut down the blow molding machine. Since
these blow molding machines are typically operated
continuously, any downtime results in significant
financial losses.For example, United States Patents 3,310,834,
Simpson et al., and 3,764,250, Waterloo, each disclose
a plastic blow molding machine including a wheel having
a frame supported on a base for rotation about a
horizontal axis with a plurality of mold stations
mounted on the wheel frame about the rotational axis
such that a pair of mold supports for respectively
mounting a pair of mold portions move parallel to the
rotational axis between open and closed positions of the 
mold. Such blow molding machines conventionally include a
closing station where the mold supports move the mold portions
to a closed position to enclose an extruded hot plastic
parison within a mold cavity for blowing to the shape of the
mold and for subsequent cooling prior to opening at an opening
station after approximately Â¾ of a revolution of the wheel.Also, United States Patent 4,698,012, which represents
the preambles of Claims 1 and 12, Shelby et al., discloses a
multi-station rotary blow molding machine having a plurality
of separable blow molds angularly arranged in a serial fashion
in a circular array within the machine. Each mold comprises
a pair of mold sections, each of which has an internal cavity
such that the mold sections, when joined, defining the
external configuration of a molded article. The mold sections
are mounted in the mold frame for movement toward and away
from each other in a direction generally parallel to the axis
of the mold frame central shaft and are separately opened and
closed as necessary during molding or cleaning operations.
The mold sections are opened and closed utilizing a cam
arrangement including a cam attached to the stationary
