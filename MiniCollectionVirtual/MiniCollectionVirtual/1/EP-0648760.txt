<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel triazine
derivative or a salt thereof, and uses for them. More
particularly, the invention relates to the novel
triazine derivatives or a salt thereof, which is useful
for controlling parasitic protozoa, particularly
coccidia and the like, and an antiprotozoan composition
comprising them.Parasitic protozoa are parasites on a broad range
of animals inclusive of mammals, birds, fishes and
insects. The parasitic protozoa establish themselves
in the internal organs or the external organs such as
the skin and eye of the host animal. As such, these
parasites give the hosts serious lesion and often
infect the producing farmers of domestic animals,
poultry and fish, causing great economic damage.
Coccidiosis, which is one of the diseases causing the
most serious economic damage to breeding, is mainly
caused by several kinds of protozoa of the genus
Eimeria, such as E. tenella, E. necatrix, E.
acervulira, E. maxima, E. brunetti and E. mivati.For example, E. tenella parasitizes the intestinal
inner walls, such as that of the caecum, and often
inflicts fatal damage on the host. Thus, the E.
tenella infection produces several manifestations such
as extensive erosion, inflammation and hemorrhage of
the intestinal paries due to the development of the
protozoa, caecal blood retention, and, hence, anaemia,
retardation of growth or death of the host.
Endoparastic protozoa are usually transmitted orally
and as to coccidiosis in particular, even intensive
disinfection with potassium dichromate solution fails 
to kill the oocysts. Moreover, since their life cycle
is as short as about 7 days, one engaged in large-scale
animal farming has to face the outbreak and spread of
disease without an effective countermeasure.As far as fishes are concerned, ectoparasitic
protozoa are serious problems of concern. Their parasitization
damages the host's skin and gills, weakens
the resistance of the host fish to infections and may
occasionally be fatal. In large-scale fish farming,
parasitic protozoa spread among the whole fish
population on a farm and the resulting economic loss is
too large to be overlooked.A similar situation prevails for insects. Taking
bees as an example, parasitic protozoan represented by
Nosemaapis are doing a great deal of harm to
apiculture all over the world. Nosemaapis destroys
the internal organs to debilitate the host bee, and the
host with accordingly decreased resistance tends to
succumb to various other diseases.Several drugs against parasitic protozoa have been
pro
