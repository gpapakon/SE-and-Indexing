<ABSTRACT>
A rotor-shaft subassembly (33) is disclosed of the type for use in a Roots 
blower supercharger. The subassembly includes a rotor (39) mounted for 

rotation on a driveshaft (41) at forward (49,53) and rearward (57,51) axially 
spaced-apart locations. The rotor (39) is a cast member with each lobe thereof 

(61,63,65) defining a hollow chamber (71,73,75). The rotor includes a 
cylindrical web portion (67) disposed axially between the forward and rearward 

locations. Each lobe cooperates with the web portion to define a core opening 
(81,83,85) adapted to facilitate removal of a core from the hollow chamber 

after completion of the casting process. Each core opening provides open 
communication between its respective hollow chamber and the shaft bore, and 

each is disposed axially between the forward and rearward locations, so that 
after the rotor is press-fit on the shaft, there is no leak path of pressurized air 

into the hollow chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rotary pumps, compressors, and blowers,
and particularly to blowers of the Roots type. More particularly, the present
invention relates to pumps and blowers of the type having rotors non-rotatably
attached to their shafts, such as by press-fitting or some other suitable means.Although the present invention may be used with various types of pumps
and blowers, it is especially advantageous when used with a Roots type blower,
and will be described in connection therewith.Rotary blowers of the Roots type typically include a pair of meshed, lobed
rotors, with each of the rotors being mounted on a shaft, and each shaft having
mounted thereon a timing gear. Rotary blowers, and particularly Roots blowers,
which are employed as superchargers for internal combustion engines normally
operate at relatively high speeds, typically in the range of 10,000 to 20,000
rpm.As is well known to those skilled in the art, it is preferable that the rotors
mesh with each other, to transfer volumes of air from an inlet port to an outlet
port, without the rotors actually touching each other, although it is known to
permit certain types of coated rotors to have limited contact. It is now
becoming more common to utilize some sort of clutch (typically, electrically
operated) disposed between an input pulley and the blower, in order to be able
to disengage the blower when its operation is not required. The durability and
life of such a clutch, as it engages and disengages the blower, is determined
largely by the inertia of the rotors which, in turn, is a function of the size and
mass (weight) of the rotor lobes. Typical Roots blowers produced commercially
by the assignee of the present invention for use as internal combustion engine
superchargers have a lobe radius in the range of about 2 inches (about 5 cm) to
about 3 inches (about 7.5 cm).The desire to reduce the rotating mass, and therefore the inertia, of the
rotor lobes has caused those working in the art to attempt to develop rotors 
which do not have solid lobes, i.e., at least some portion of each lobe is
"hollow". In some of the so-called "hollow" rotor designs, the "hollow" portion
would be in communication with some portion of the pressurized air, thus
creating a leakage path reducing volumetric efficiency. In other attempts at
producing hollow lobed rotors, the hollow portion of each lobe was wholly
within the lobe, and therefore would not result in a leakage path. However,
such rotors were typically of a two-piece type of construction,
