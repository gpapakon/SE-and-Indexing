<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas barrier films,
and more particularly to films are obtainable from a
mixture containing poly(meth)acrylic acid and/or a
partially neutralized product thereof and a saccharide
such as starch, and excellent in water resistance and
barrier property to gases such as oxygen, and a production
process thereof.The films according to the present invention are
excellent in water resistance (insolubility in water and
boiling water) and oxygen gas barrier property, and are
hence suitable for use as packaging materials for food
containing a great amount of water and/or oil, which is
susceptible to deterioration with oxygen, such as
oxidation.Poly(meth)acrylic acid or partially neutralized
products thereof are water-soluble polymers and widely
used as water-absorbing materials, thickeners,
flocculants, dispersants, and treating agents for paper and
fibers, making good use of their hydrophilic
nature. The poly(meth)acrylic acid or partially 
neutralized products thereof may be formed into films from
their solutions by a casting process. The resultant films
are excellent in oxygen gas barrier property under dry
conditions. However, these films are unsuitable for
packaging of food containing a great amount of water
because they show strong hydrophilic nature, and are hence
markedly impaired in oxygen gas barrier property under
high-humidity conditions, and moreover easy to dissolve in
water.In U.S. Patent No. 2,169,250, it is described to
polymerize a methacrylic acid monomer in an aqueous
solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), cast the resulting
reaction mixture on a support, evaporate the water, and
then heat the dry film for 5 minutes at 140°C, thereby
reacting PVA with polymethacrylic acid to obtain a water-insoluble
film (Example I). According to the results of
an investigation by the present inventors, however, any
film exhibiting excellent oxygen gas barrier property
under high-humidity conditions can not be obtained by such
heat treatment conditions.On the other hand, films formed of starch are
excellent in oil resistance and oxygen gas barrier
property, but involve a disadvantage that they are poor in
mechanical strength and water resistance. Starch is a
natural polysaccharide derived from plants and is composed
of straight-chain amylose in which glucose units are 
linked by α(1-4) glycosidic bonds, and a high molecular
weight amylopectin in which a great number of short
amylose units are linked in a branched structure through
α(1-6) glycosidic bonds. Examples of the starch
