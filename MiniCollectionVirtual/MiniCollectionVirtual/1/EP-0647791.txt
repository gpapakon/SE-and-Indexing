<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clutch device with a clutch part (1) on the gearbox side and a clutch part (2) on the engine side, these parts being arranged centred relative to one another, and with a gearbox-side pressure plate (7) and an engine-side pressure plate (8) which are connected securely to one another in terms of rotation, the engine-side pressure plate (8) and the engine-side clutch part (2) being connected to one another firmly in terms of rotation, and the gearbox-side clutch part (1) being pressed against the engine-side clutch part (2) by means of the gearbox-side pressure plate (7), the gearbox-side clutch part (1) being connected frictionally both to the gearbox-side pressure plate (7) and to the engine-side clutch part (2). In a clutch device of this kind, reliable transmission of the starting torque is guaranteed and destruction when torques higher than the starting torque occur is reliably prevented.

<CLAIMS>
Coupling device, comprising the following 
features: 


a) a gear-side coupling part (1) and a motor-side 
coupling part (2) which are arranged centred with 

respect to each other and each comprise internal 
geared sockets (3, 4) and external geared hubs (5, 

6), 
b) a gear-side pressure plate (7) and a motor-side 
pressure plate (8) which are connected to each 

other in a rotationally secure manner, whereby 
c) the motor-side pressure plate (8) and the motor-side 
coupling part (2) are connected to each other 

in a rotationally secure manner, 
d) the gear-side coupling part (1) is pressed against 
the motor-side coupling part (2) by means of the 

gear-side pressure plate (7), whereby 
e) the gear-side coupling part (1) is frictionally 
engaged both with the gear-side pressure plate (7) 

and with the motor-side coupling part (2). 
Coupling device according to claim 1, having 
the following features: 


f) the gear-side coupling part (1) and the motor-side 
coupling part (2) each comprise an internal geared 

socket (3, 4) with straight teeth and an external 
geared hub (5, 6) with spherically constructed 

teeth, whereby 
g) the one hub (6) is disposed on the drive-side 
shaft (13) and the other hub (5) is disposed on 

the output-side shaft (14) and 
h) both sockets (3, 4) are frictionally engaged with 
each other. 
Coupling device according to claim 1 or 2, 
having the following feature:
 
i) a pin (15) is held on one side in one of the two 

pressure plates (7, 8) and is guided in the other  
 

pressure plate (7) in an axially moveable manner. 
Coupling device according to claim 1, having 
the following feature:
 
j) the motor-side coupling part (2) and the motor-side 

pressure plate (8) are constructed in one 
piece. 
Coupling device according to claim 1, having 
the following feature:
 
k) at least one friction surface (11, 12) has a 

friction lining (16, 17). 
Coupling device according to claim 1, having 
the following feature:
 
l) the friction lining or the friction linings (16, 

17) are manufactured from an aluminium-bronze 
alloy. 
Coupling device according to claim 1, having 
the following feature:
 
m) the friction lining or the friction linings (16, 

17) are affixed to the friction surface or the 
friction surfaces (11, 12).
