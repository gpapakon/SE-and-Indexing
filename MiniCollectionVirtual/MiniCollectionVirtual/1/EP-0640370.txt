<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for discharging solid constituents from a fluid in a chute (1) having a conveying means (3) designed as a conveying channel (4) and a rotary driven conveyor screw (6), the conveying means (3) having a solids discharge (9) at one end and at the other end a screen surface (15) arranged at least in part-surfaces, in which the solid constituents can be screened out of the fluid and can be removed via the conveyor screw (6) in an axial direction of the conveying means (3) towards the solids discharge (9). In order to provide a device which can also process relatively large fluid flow rates, even when the inflowing rate varies, it is proposed that the conveying means (3), between the solids discharge (9) and the screen surface (15) arranged on the inlet side of the conveyor path, has a screen device (19) whose screen area projected onto the conveying means (3) is greater than the diameter of the conveying channel (14), the screen device (19) being arranged at the height of the maximum fluid level in the chute (1) and discharging into the conveying means (3) solid constituents screened off.
