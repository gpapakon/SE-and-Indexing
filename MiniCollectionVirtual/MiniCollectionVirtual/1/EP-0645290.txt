A booster housing, especially for vehicle brake systems, 
comprising 


two housing bottoms (26, 28) which are disposed at either 
side of a movable partition (60) and are provided with fastening 

holes (30, 48), 
connecting members (32) which are mounted on at least 
one of the housing bottoms (26) and are tightly crimped 

with the same around one of its fastening holes (30) each, and 
spacers (50) which extend between the two housing bottoms 
(26, 28) as well as through the movable partition (60) and 

are fixed to the connecting members (32), 
characterized
 in that
 
each of the connecting members (32) has a recess (40) into 

which an end portion (52) of the associated spacer (50) 
is inserted and crimped. 
The booster housing as defined in claim 1
characterized
 in that
 
the end portion (52) of the spacer comprises a knurled 

portion (54). 
The booster housing as defined in claim 1 or claim 2
characterized
 in that
 
the end portion (52) of the spacer (50) is provided with 

an annular groove (56) and that an annular projection (70) 
is formed on the associated connecting member (32) and is 

pressed into the annular groove (56) at least partly by 
the crimping operation.  

 
A method of assembling a booster housing as defined 
in any one of claims 1 to 3
characterized
 by the steps: 

inserting an end portion (52) of a spacer (50) into a 
recess (40) of a connecting member (32), 
passing the connecting member (32) through a fastening 
hole (30) in a housing bottom (26) in such a way that a 

collar (36) formed on the connecting member (32) extends 
through the fastening hole (30), and 
simultaneous crimping of the connecting member (32) with 
the housing bottom (26) and the spacer (50). 
The method as defined in claim 4,
characterized
 in that
 
on the front side of a flange (35) formed on the connecting 

member (32) said connecting member is crimped with the 
housing bottom (26), and on the rear side of the same flange 

(34) it is crimped with the spacer (50).
