<ABSTRACT>
A prophylactic and a remedy for viral diseases in the respiratory tract, each containing a lung surfactant as the active ingredient 
and being applicable to the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by a virus which contains an adventitial glycoprotein 

and which epidemically infects the respiratory tract and proliferates therein, such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RS virus, 
measles virus or mumps virus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a prophylactic and 
therapeutic agent for viral diseases in a region of the 
respiratory tract which contains a pulmonary surfactant 
(hereinafter referred to as "PSF"). More particularly, it 
relates to an agent containing a PSF as active ingredient 
and useful for the prevention and treatment of viral 
diseases in a region of the respiratory tract where 
bronchial mucoepithelial secretory cells are interspersed. Bronchial mucoepithelial secretory cells are 
interspersed in a region of the respiratory tract, 
especially in a bronchial region. These cells have the 
function of secreting airway mucus and, moreover, is said 
to be partly involved in the production of an in vivo 
pulmonary surface-active substance. On the other hand, a 
PSF is a substance comprising, as a principal component, a 
phospholipid consisting essentially of a phosphatidyl-choline 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "choline 
phosphoglyceride"), and a great variety of PSFs have been 
reported as will be described later. According to those 
reports, PSFs generally have the effect of reducing the 
surface tension of the gas-liquid interface in pulmonary 
alveoli, maintaining the alveolar cavities physiologically, 
and thereby smoothing the respiratory function of the 
lungs. Accordingly, they are accepted as useful therapeutic 
agents for respiratory distress syndrome that is a highly  
 
fatal disease caused by a lack of the in vivo pulmonary 
surface-active substance. It has also be reported in 
International Publication WO91/17766 that PSFs have the 
effect of stabilizing the bronchi and suppressing allergic 
bronchoconstriction and, therefore, are useful as 
therapeutic agents for asthma. However, little is known about the role of the 
bronchial mucoepithelial secretory cells in the living 
body, and no distinct relationship between the bronchial 
mucoepithelial secretory cells and viral diseases or 
between these cells and the in vivo pulmonary surface-active 
substance has been elucidated as yet. Accordingly, 
the effectiveness of PSFs in viral diseases has not been 
known. The present inventors have carried on investigations 
on proteases and viruses for many years and have now found 
that (1) a trypsin-like protease (hereinafter referred to 
tentatively as "Tryptase Clara") is secreted from the 
bronchial mucoepithelial secretory cells, as discovered by 
the present inventors; (2) Tryptase Clara limitedly 
decomposes virus envelope glycoprotein precursors to mature 
type virus envelope
