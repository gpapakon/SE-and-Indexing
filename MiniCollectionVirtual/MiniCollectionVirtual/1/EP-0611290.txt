<ABSTRACT>
A method for automatically analyzing the morphometry of bone (20, 21) from data obtained by lateral digital scans of the bone (20, 21) obtains a matrix of data values assembled from an x-ray scan. The matrix is analyzed to locate an axis of the bone from which subsequent measures may be referenced. Once the axis is fixed, one or more of several useful indicia of bone condition such as length or interbone spacing can be calculated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the general field
of bone densitometry and vertebral morphology and
relates, in particular, to an
apparatus for the determination and analysis of
vertebral morphology utilizing techniques of bone
densitometry.Digital bone densitometry devices such as the DPX
machines manufactured by LUNAR Corporation of Madison,
Wisconsin or the QDR machines manufactured by Hologic,
Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts, are used to generate
broadly based values of bone character, such as bone
mineral content ("BMC") or bone mineral density
("BMD"). Such information about bone character, and in
particular, about bone character in the spine is often
relied on to diagnose and treat bone depletive
disorders such as osteoporosis. In the case of
osteoporosis, bone density measurements alone are not
definitive for diagnosis. The clinician must also look
for evidence of spinal fracture. J. A. Kanis, et al.
Osteoporosis Int. 1:182-188 (1991) Determining whether
a fracture is present is important both on clinical
grounds and for research purposes. In the clinical
setting, a patient may display a reduced BMD but the
clinician is hesitant or unwilling to begin a 
particular treatment regimen without a diagnosis of
fracture or deformity. In the research setting,
diagnosis of fracture is important in studying the
incidence and prevalence of osteoporosis in a
population, or as an entry criterion to a clinical
study, or as a measure of efficacy with regard to a
particular treatment. In this regard, the European
Foundation for Osteoporosis has published guidelines
for clinical trials in osteoporosis which recommends a
definition of osteoporosis as a "disorder where one or
more fractures has arisen due to an increase in the
fragility of bone," and an endpoint of fracture
reduction in studies of efficacy of new drugs for the
treatment of osteoporosis. J.A. Kanis, et al.While the presence or absence of vertebral
fracture is critical in the diagnosis of osteoporosis,
diagnosis of vertebral fracture is often difficult.
Over one-half of such fractures are asymptomatic, and
in cases of minimal symptoms obvious fracture or
deformity will often not be observed particularly if
there is no previous radiological record for
comparison.Vertebral morphometry techniques promise to make
the determination of vertebral fracture or deformation
more objective. These approaches rely on certain
indexes or normative values of vertebral body
dimensions. See e.g. Minne et al., "A Newly Developed
Spine Deformity Index (SDI) to
