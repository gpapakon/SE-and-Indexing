<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel insecticidal composition.Synergistically and cooperatively active insecticidal compositions were disclosed
in British Patent No. 2,001,852 specification, Belgian Patent No. 861342
specification, French Patent No. 2,396,507 specification. U.S. Patent No. 3,864,388
specification, U.S. Patent No. 4,047,928 specification, U.S. Patent No. 5,153,182
specification, Japanese Patent Application Disclosure No. Sho 58-126803
specification, and so on. Further, it has also been known to some extent that
synergistic effect on insecticides can be obtained by using, as adjuvants,
phosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroid series compound.It has become a pressing problem, in recent years, to control Thysanoptera
represented by Thrips palmi Karny that seriously damages vegetables and
flowering plants.Thrips palmi Karny is known to devour tissue of plants, thus hollowing the
relevant cellular tissue, bleaching the leaves and, eventually wilting them to wither
in case the damage is serious.Thrips palmi Karny is known to seriously damage fruits-bearing plants and
vegetables grown by house culture particularly in Kyushu and Shikoku districts.Further, Thysanoptera far easily acquires resistance to commercially available
pesticides (insecticide) as compared with other pests, posing a problem of finding
a reliable control means to cope with the situation.There has now been found a novel insecticidal composition consisting of 1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitro-imidazolidin-2-ylideneamine
of the formula (I) 

and piperonylbutoxide.Surprisingly, it has been found that the insecticidal composition according to the
present invention exhibits an insecticidal activity far higher than that shown by
compound as such represented by the formula (I) and that such a high
activity is derived from cooperative and synergistic effects of a combination of
two kinds of active components.It has now been confirmed that the insecticidal composition according to the
present invention exhibits a very remarkable insecticidal effect against the above-mentioned
Thysanoptera. The compound represented by the formula (I) has been known before the
filing date of the present patent application.The weight ratios of the active compound couple employed in the present
insecticidal composition may be varied within a wide range.In general, use may be made, per 1 part by weight of the compound represented
by the general formula (I), of about 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably about 1 to
25 parts by weight of piperonylbutoxide.
