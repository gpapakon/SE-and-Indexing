<CLAIMS>
Process for thermal separation of organic and/or inorganic
materials as well as water from contaminated grounds, sands,

slurries, solid material aggregates and solid residues, wherein

a) the contaminated material is, after pre-treatment, heated in a
directly or indirectly heated oven is designed as a rotary pipe

oven, fluidized bed oven or floating bed reactor, and during
heating treated with fed back hot gases or hot steam and with

oxidants;
b) exiting water-vapour containing treatment gases are dusted
and between 80 and 90 vol.-% of water-vapour containing

treatment gases are, under exclusion of condensation, fed
back into the oven as drag gas;
c) the remaining portion of the water-vapour containing treatment
gases are subjected to condensation, and a thus formed liquid

phase is extracted and wet-chemically or physically freed of
pollutants.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 gases
exiting from the condensation stage are freed from remaining

pollutants by adsorption.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 oxygen
enriched air, O
2
, H
2
O
2
 and/or ozone is/are used as oxidant.
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the
exiting water-vapour containing treatment gases are after dusting

catalytically oxidised, and a partial flow of gases exiting
condensation stage c) is fed back into the stage of catalytic

oxidation.
Process according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 oxides
and/or sulfates of one or more transition metal selected from

vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc,
molybdenum or tungsten as catalytic active substances are used

for catalytic oxidation. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

exiting water-vapour containing treatment gases are radiated by
UV light after dusting.
Process according to Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the
oxidant is fed directly into the oven.
Process according to Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the
contaminated material is dried prior to delivery into the oven.
Process according to Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the
contaminated material is reduced and/or classified prior to

delivery into the oven.
Process according to Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the
contaminated material is refined and gravimetrically separated

prior to delivery into the oven.
