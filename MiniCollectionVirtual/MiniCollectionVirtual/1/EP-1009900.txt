<ABSTRACT>
A window lift system generally comprises a motor (48) driving a threaded shaft (56) threadably engaging a nut (52) slidably mounted in a bracket (46). A link (54) has a first end rotatably mounted to the nut (52) and a second end rotatably mounted to an end (28) of a pivotally mounted arm (24). An opposite end (26) of the arm engaging the window glass (22) raises and lowers the window glass as the arm pivots.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to window lift system and more
particularly to a window lift system using a screw drive.Current window lift systems generally comprise a first arm pivotally
mounted between a first end supporting a window glass and a second end
having a 90° sector of gear teeth. The gear teeth engage a spur gear which is
coupled to a worm gear driven by a worm driven by a motor. The motor
drives the worm, worm gear and spur gear rotatably, thereby causing the first
arm to pivot. The pivoting of the first arm raise and lower the window glass.
A second arm is typically pivotally mounted to the first arm between the first
end and pivot point of the first arm. A first end of the second arm supports
the window glass while an opposite second end of the second arm is pivotally
mounted to a slide which freely slides forwardly and rearwardly during the
raising and lowering of the window.The known window lift system has low efficiency, due to the low
efficiency of the worm/worm gear engagement. Further, the cost of the
known system is relatively high, due to the number of gears.Examples of other prior window lift systems
are described in US-A-2640694 ; US-A-2710058 and
DE-A-4123193. Such prior systems admit of improvement
in particular in terms of efficacy, efficiency and
generally.According to the present invention there is
provided a window lift system as defined in the
accompanying claims.An embodiment of the present invention provides an improved window lift system which
is simplified, has a reduced number of parts and exhibits increased efficiency.In an embodiment, the window lift motor rotatably drives a
threaded shaft which threadably engages an internally threaded nut, which in
turn engages a second end of a first arm pivotally mounted between first and
second ends. Preferably, a link has a first end rotatably mounted to the nut
and an opposite second end rotatably mounted to the second end of the first
arm. The nut is slidably mounted in a guide in a bracket to which the motor 
is fixedly mounted and in which the first arm is pivotally mounted.
Preferably, the motor includes a two-stage coupled epicyclic gear unit which
provides an increase in torque for driving the threaded shaft.In operation, rotation of the motor rotatably drives the threaded shaft,
thereby moving the nut along the guide in the bracket. Movement of the nut
along the guide in the bracket causes the arm to pivot, thereby raising and
lowering the window.As an example of an alternative window lift system,
not

<CLAIMS>
A window lift system (20) including a motor (48)
rotatably driving a threaded shaft (50), an arm (24)

having a first (26) and second (28) end used to
raise/lower a window glass (22), the first end (26)

supporting the window glass (22), and a threaded slide
(52) threadably engaging said shaft (50);

   the system 
characterised by
 a link (54) having a
first end (56) pivotally mounted to said slide and an

opposite second end (58) pivotally mounted to said
second end (28) of said arm (24), said slide (52)

engaging said second end (28) of said arm (24) through
said link (54), such that rotation of said shaft (50)

causes linear displacement of said slide (52) relative
to said shaft (50) and therefore pivotal movement of

said arm (24) through said link (54) about a fixed
pivot point (30) located between said first (26) and

second (28) ends.
The window lift system (20) of Claim 1 wherein said
slide (52) comprises an internally threaded nut.
The window lift system (20) of Claim 1 further
comprising a bracket (46), said bracket (46) defining

a guide (66) limiting movement of said slide (52) along
said guide (66).
The window lift system (20) of Claim 3 wherein said
guide (66) is a slot in said bracket (46), said slide

(52) including a portion extending into said slot.
The window lift system (20) of Claim 4 wherein said arm
(24) is pivotally mounted to said bracket (46) and said

motor (48) is mounted to said bracket (46). 
The window lift system (20) of Claim 1 wherein said arm
(24) is a first arm, said window lift system (24)

including a second arm (34) having a first end (38) for
supporting a window glass (22) and a slidably mounted

opposite second end (40).
The window lift system (20) of Claim 1 further
including a gear unit (51) coupling said motor (48) to

said threaded shaft (50), said gear unit (51) providing
a plurality of gear ratios between said motor (48) and

said threaded shaft (50).
