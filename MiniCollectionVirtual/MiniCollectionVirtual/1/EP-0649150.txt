<ABSTRACT>
The composite material has a filler and a matrix embedding the filler. At least one physical variable produces in this composite material at least two non-linear changes of one material property or at least one non-linear change in each case of one of at least two material properties by acting on the filler and/or the matrix. The filler predominantly contains a component with particles of a core-shell structure and/or of a granular microstructure. However, filler with particles of a granular microstructure does not contain any further filler component with electrically conductive particles whose electrical conductivity is higher than the electrical conductivity of the particles of a granular microstructure in the effect of an electric field leading to a non-linear change of the electrical conductivity of the composite material. The composite material is simple to produce and, by suitable selection of the filler and of the matrix, can be easily adapted in its material properties to a specified set of requirements.

Electrical resistor having a resistance body made
of a filler and a polymer matrix in which the filler is

embedded, the resistivity of which resistor increases
nonlinearly above a transition temperature owing to a PTC

transition at which current paths formed by the filler
