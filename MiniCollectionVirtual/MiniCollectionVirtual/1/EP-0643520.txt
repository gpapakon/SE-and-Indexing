<ABSTRACT>
A telephone long distance service is provided using speaker verification to 
determine whether a user whether a user is a valid user or an impostor. The 

user claims an identity by offering some form of identification, typically by 
entering a calling card number on the phone's touch-tone keypad or by magnetic 

strip on the card which is read by the telephone. Unrestricted, extemporaneous 
speech of a group of customers are digitized, analyzed in accordance with a 

PCM circuit, and characterized as a non-parametric set of speech feature 
vectors. The extemporaneous speech of the long distance telephone service 

user claiming the identity of a service customer via his card number is digitized 
and analyzed in a like manner. The identity of the user is verified by comparing, 

either during or after the call, the signals in accordance with an algorithm which 
compares a reference utterance of a known customer with input utterances from 

one or more unknown telephone service users, one of which users has claimed 
the identity of the customer. This comparison results in a decision to accept or 

reject the hypothesized identity. The identity hypothesis to be tested is thus 
derived from the calling card of the customer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a speaker verification system and more
particularly, to an apparatus and method for passive voice monitoring in a
telephone network.Long distance credit card services must identify a user to ensure that an impostor
does not use the service under another person's identity. It has been estimated
that the aggregate losses to the long distance services due to unauthorized
use is in the one to four billion dollar range. Because of the magnitude of
these losses, telephone companies are investigating methods of verifying the
identity of the caller each time a call is placed. Prior art systems typically
provide a lengthy identification number (calling card number) which must be
entered via the phone's keypad to initiate the long distance service. Unfortunately,
this approach is prone to abuse because the identification number may
be easily appropriated by theft, or by simply observing the entry of the identification
number by another. Accordingly, a biometric technique, as opposed to a
method based solely on the knowledge of a password or possession of a key, is
preferable. Voice is an ideal medium because every consumer already has the
required equipment, a telephone.A number of recognition techniques have been proposed for identifying a speaker
on the basis of prerecorded samples of his speech. As is known in the art, it
is possible to represent a voice pattern with a sequence of P-dimensional
feature vectors. In accordance with the pattern to be represented, the number P
may be from 1 to 10 or more. Speech utterances may be represented as collections
of these vectors. In certain conventional speaker verification systems, the
password speech pattern uttered by a registered speaker is stored as a reference
pattern, and at the time of verification, a code specifying the speaker 
(hereinafter the "registered speech number") and the password spoken by a
speaker to be verified are input. The reference pattern specified by the registered
speaker number and the uttered speech pattern of the password (hereinafter
the "input pattern") are compared with each other to calculate an evaluation
value of dissimilarity therebetween. If the dissimilarity is smaller than a predetermined
threshold value, the speaker is recognized as the registered person, and
if the dissimilarity is greater, the speaker is judged to be an impostor.Voice verification methods currently being tested by telephone companies
prompt the user to speak one or more predetermined, short authorization phrases
