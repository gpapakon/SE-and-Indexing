Moulded mixtures of useful materials for promoting and sustaining plant 
growth which contain plant nutrients and/or plant protection agents in the form 

of a mixture with a thermoplastic binder, characterized in that they contain 
starch thermomechanically digested at elevated temperatures and pressures 

in quantities of around 10 to 40% by weight as the binder. 
Mixtures as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the starch has been 
thermoplasticized using limited quantities of water and/or low molecular weight 

plasticizers, more especially biologically compatible lower polyhydric alcohols. 
Mixtures as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in that they contain 
the thermomechanically digested starch in quantities of around 15 to 30% by 

weight, based on the weight of the mixture as a whole, and for the rest the 
plant-active ingredients or mixtures thereof, optionally in admixture with 

auxiliaries, such as fillers, lubricants and/or dyes and/or fragrances. 
Mixtures as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in that they are 
present in the form of a moulded intimate mixture of solids and are made up as 

powders, granules but especially in the form of fertilizer rodlets. 
Mixtures as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in that they are 
largely dimensionally stable and tack-free in the presence of air, but release 

their plant-active ingredients on contact with soil and especially when 
embedded in the plant soil, preferably with simultaneous degradation of the 

starch. 
Mixtures as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in that they have 
been produced by mixing of the ingredients and thermoplasticization - known 

per se - of the water-containing starch with addition of small quantities of 
biologically safe plasticizers, more especially glycerol, and subsequent 

moulding. 
Mixtures as claimed in claims 1 to 6, characterized in that they are in the 
form of fertilizer rodlets for the home and garden and also for nurseries and  

 
preferably have diameters of around 2 to 20 mm and a length of around 20 to 

200 mm. 
Mixtures as claimed in claims 1 to 7, characterized in that, in the form 
of fertilizer rodlets, they have comparatively high flexural strengths, for 

example of at least 3,000 N/cm
2
, whereas in the form of powders and/or 
granules they may have lower strength values. 
A process for the production of the moulded mixtures of useful materials 
for promoting plant growth claimed in claims 1 to 8, characterized in that native 

starch is mixed with the plant-active ingredients and optionally fillers, if desired 
more water and the low molecular weight plasticizers, the multicomponent 

mixture is subjected to the starch digestion process at elevated temperature 
and pressure and, at the same time, intensively mixed and/or kneaded to form 

the thermoplastically processable starch and, if desired, the homogenized 
mixture is moulded. 
A process as claimed in claim 9, characterized in that the mixing 
process and digestion of the starch are carried out in closed kneaders or 

preferably in extruders, the residence time and the processing conditions being 
co-ordinated in such a way that both thermomechanical digestion of the starch 

and homogeneous incorporation of the useful materials and optionally fillers 
are guaranteed. 
A process as claimed in claims 9 and 10, characterized in that it is 
carried out at product temperatures above 90°C and preferably in the range 

from about 95 to 120°C, at least in the final stages of the mixing and starch 
digestion process. 
A process as claimed in claims 9 to 11, characterized in that it is carried 
out, more especially continuously, with residence times of the multicomponent 

mixture under working conditions of up to about 30 minutes and preferably in 
the range from about 0.5 to 10 minutes and under the pressure spontaneously 

established in the system at the process temperature.  
 
A process as claimed in claims 9 to 12, characterized in that mixing and 
the starch digestion process are carried out in heated extruders to which the 

starch - preferably in the form of starch powder with a natural water content - 
and the useful materials and fillers are fed as separate solids or even in the 

form of a mixture while the low molecular weight plasticizers and/or additional 
water are best added as a separate stream in the feed section and in that the 

homogenized and digested mixture is obtained in the form of an extrudate, if 
desired after the partial removal of excess water. 
A process as claimed in claims 9 to 13, characterized in that the 
strength and/or brittleness of the dry product are controlled by the quantities 

of starch and/or plasticizers (water and/or organic plasticizers) added. 
A process as claimed in claims 9 to 14, characterized in that the low 
molecular weight plasticizers are used in quantities of about 5 to 30% by 

weight and preferably in quantities of about 15 to 30% by weight, based on 
water-containing starch, the total content of water and plasticizers preferably 

being in the range from about 25 to 55% by weight and more preferably in the 

range from about 35 to 50% by weight, based on the sum total of starch, water 
and low molecular weight plasticizer. 
The use of thermomechanically digested starch in quantities of about 10 
to 40% by weight, optionally in admixture with small quantities of other 

biologically safe binder constituents, as a biodegradable binder for mixtures of 
useful materials for promoting and sustaining plant growth.
