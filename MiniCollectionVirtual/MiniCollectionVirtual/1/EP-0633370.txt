<ABSTRACT>
The profile section includes a bearing central body and several superposed sets of two lateral wings which are symmetric to one another relative to the bearing central body. According to the invention, the bearing central body is a solid body (2) duplicated at the bottom in the shape of a fork, the two legs (6, 7) of which are symmetric relative to the plane (AA') passing through the top part of the said solid body; the profile section further comprises:   a) at least four sets of two wings, two (9, 10) in the region of the top part and two (11, 12) in the region of the duplicated bottom part of the central body, b) two lateral hollow bodies (14a, 14b) of a single piece with the central body, each being respectively formed of the two superposed wings (10a, 11a) of the two middle sets (10, 11) and a joining face (13a) connecting the ends of the two said wings.   Application: producing removable roofing structures, and more particularly roofing structures for pools where the roof can be opened up.

Profile for an uncoverable roofing structure, 
including a bearing central body and several superimposed 

sets of two small lateral flanges which are symmetric 
with one another with respect to the bearing central 

body, characterized in that the bearing central body is 
a solid body (2) divided into two at its bottom part, in 

the form of a fork, the two legs (6, 7) of which are 
symmetrical with respect to the plane (AA') passing 

through the top part of the said solid body and in that 
it includes: 


a) at least four sets of two small flanges, two 
(9, 10) at the top and two (11, 12) at the bottom, split 

into two, of the central body, 
b) two lateral hollow bodies (14a, 14b) of a 
single piece with the central body, each one being 

respectively formed by the two superimposed small flanges 
(10a, 11a) of the middle two sets (10, 11) and a joining 

face (13a) connecting the ends of the two said small 
flanges. 
Profile according to Claim 1 used as a hoop of an 
uncoverable roofing structure, characterized in that it 

is fixed to a brace passing through the two lateral 
hollow bodies (14a, 14b) by means of a fixing screw which 

is located in the lower slot (8) of the profile, corresponding 
to the gap between the two legs (6, 7) and which 

passes through the top part of the solid body (2), and in 
that it further includes a closure piece (18) making it 

possible to close off the said lower slot (8). 
Profile according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the bottom part, split into two, of the solid body  

 
has substantially the same height as the top part. 
Profile according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the joining face (13a, 13b) of each hollow body 

(14a, 14b) is parallel to the vertical plane of symmetry 
(AA') of the profile (1) and is substantially in alignment 

with the free ends (9'
a
, 12'
a
) of the other small 
flanges (9, 12). 
Profile according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the transverse section of the slot (8) between the 

two legs (6, 7) is of rectangular section. 
Profile according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each hollow body (14a, 14b) has an internal transverse 

section in the shape of an inverted cradle. 
Profile according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the upper edge (3a) of the bearing central body 

projects relative to the plane of the two small flanges 
(9a, 9b) of the upper set, out of the top part of the 

profile. 
Profile according to Claim 1 or 6, characterized 
in that at least the two small flanges (11a, 11b) respectively 

forming the lower face of the hollow bodies (14a, 
14b) are each provided over the entire length of the 

profile, with a groove (17a, 17b) which can be used to 
house a seal.
