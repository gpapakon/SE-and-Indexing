<ABSTRACT>
An interrupt controller includes an interrupt request 
register for receiving interrupt requests from various 

peripherals or I/O devices via a set of request lines. A 
priority resolver is further provided for comparing the priority 

level of the interrupt lines, latching the lower priority 
requests in a stand-by mode, and directing servicing of the 

highest priority level. An in-service register is provided for 
storing the identification of any request line that is being 

serviced by the microprocessor. In one embodiment, a set of 
signal lines are coupled between the in-service register and 

external terminals of the integrated circuit on which the 
interrupt controller is fabricated. A power management unit may 

be coupled to the external pins of the integrated circuit and 
thereby receives real-time information regarding an interrupt 

request that is currently being serviced and regarding interrupt 
service routines that have completed. Using this information, 

the power management unit advantageously stops unused clock 
signals and/or removes power from inactive circuit portions when 

an interrupt routine completes without having to estimate the 
time of completion. By accurately stopping unused clock signals 

and removing power, a reduction in the overall power consumption 
of the computer system can be attained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to computer systems and more particularly to interrupt
controllers and power management within computer systems.EP-A-0 358 330 discloses a computer system comprising peripheral devices
and a programmable interrupt controller. The interrupt controller includes an
interrupt request register which receives a plurality of interrupt request signals from
the peripheral devices, a priority resolver circuit and an in-service register. The in-service
register stores the identification of any interrupt request line that is being
serviced by the microprocessor. The computer system disclosed in this document
includes the features recited in the preamble of accompanying claim 1.EP-A-0 421 431 discloses a computer system having a sleep mode function in
order to save power when the CPU is idle. The I/O status routine of the system BIOS
is used to determine whether the CPU is idle and thus to control entry into the sleep
mode. In the sleep mode, the CPU stops feeding the clock pulse to the CPU.GB-A-2 235 797 discloses a power management system for a portable
computer. The system includes a software routine for continually monitoring various
units and when certain units are either not needed and/or not currently in use, power
and/or clock signals are removed from a given unit. The computer can be switched
into three modes, namely normal, slow and sleep.An on-going developmental goal of manufacturers has been to reduce the
power consumption of computer systems. Reducing power consumption typically
reduces heat generation of the system, thereby increasing reliability and decreasing
cost. In addition, power reduction has been particularly important in maximizing the
operating life of battery-powered portable computer systems. Various techniques have been devised for reducing the power consumption of
computer systems. These techniques include increasing the integration of circuitry
and incorporation of improved circuitry and power management units (PMU's). One
specific power reduction technique involves the capability of stopping (or reducing
the frequency of) clock signals that drive inactive circuit portions. A system
employing such a technique typically includes a power management unit that detects
or predicts inactive circuit portions and accordingly stops the clock signals associated
with the inactive circuit portions. By turning off "unused" clock signals that drive
inactive circuit portions, overall power consumption of the system is decreased. A
similar technique involves removing the power
