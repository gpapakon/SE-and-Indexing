<ABSTRACT>
Between the substrates with electrodes (13,14) arranged to face 
each other, there is held a nematic liquid crystal layer 

having a molecular arrangement capable of obtaining two or 
more directions of the tilt direction when an electric field 

is applied. The electrode structure is formed by a region 
having the conductive sections (13a,14a) the width of 

which is 50 µm or 
less in the widest part and the non-conductive 

sections (13b,14b) the 
width of which is 50 µm or less in the widest part per pixel. 

Between the substrates arranged to face each other, the 
conductive sections and non-conductive sections are opposed to 

each other at least per pixel in a part of the region in the 
pixel, and given the width of the narrowest part of the 

non-conductive sections as S, and the distance between the 

electrodes of the substrates arranged to face each other as D, 
the relationship of D ≧ S/2 is satisfied. With this 

structure, it is possible to obtain a liquid crystal display 
device-having a high light scattering characteristic at a low 

driving voltage, and also, with a high gradation having a 
bright. contrast ratio. There is no inverted display even when 

a gradation display is executed, and a liquid crystal display 
device can be obtained with an extremely wide viewing angle. 

These characteristics can be sufficiently maintained in 
practice in a state of a voltage being applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new liquid crystal
display device, and a liquid crystal display apparatus using
such device.In recent years, the liquid crystal display apparatus
(hereinafter referred to to as LCD) is widely used for a word
processor, personal computer, projection TV, small TV, or the
like.In the LCD, an image is indicated by controlling the
changes of transmittancy of light. For a control of the kind,
there are, among others, a method for controlling light by a
combination of the polarization effect of liquid crystal
molecules and the polarizer; a method utilizing the phase
change of liquid crystal by the application of light
scattering and transmission; and a method utilizing the
changes of lighting and shading of colors by adding pigments
to the liquid crystal, and controlling the absorbing amount of
visible light of the pigments.The LCD using the method wherein the polarization effect
and polarizer are combined is a twisted nematic LCD having the 
molecular arrangement which is twisted 90°, for example. In
principle, it is possible to control the polarized light by
use of a thin liquid crystal layer and application of a low
voltage. As a result, the TN LCD presents the characteristics
of a high contrast ratio with a quick response speed at a low
power consumption. This TN LCD is applicable to a watch and a
calculator by a simple matrix drive, and also, to a full-color
liquid crystal TV by a combination of an active matrix drive
provided with switching devices per pixel, and color filters.However, since these LCDs in which the polarization
effect and polarizer are combined should use a polarizer on
principle, the amount of transmitted light of the LCD is
considerably reduced. That is, the amount of transmitted
light is reduced at least to 50% or less because at least one
polarizer is used. Also, the represented colors and contrast
ratio of these LCDs vary greatly depending on the viewing
angles due to the orientation of the liquid crystal molecular
arrangement. Therefore, these LCDs have the viewing angle
dependence. In addition to this viewing angle dependence, the
transmittance indicated by the amount of transmitted light is
low against the amount of incident light. Actually,
therefore, the TN LCD has not arrived at the stage as yet that
its display capability exceeds that of the cold-cathode ray
tube completely.On the other hand, the LCD utilizing the phase change of
the liquid crystal, and the LCD controlling the absorbing
amount of visible light of pigments are, among others,
