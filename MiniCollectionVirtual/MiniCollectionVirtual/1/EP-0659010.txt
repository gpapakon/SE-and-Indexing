<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
apparatus having a display device (image display
apparatus) as a part of the apparatus body, for example
like image recording apparatus such as electronic
filing systems (magnetooptical disk systems), word
processors, personal computers, microfilm readers,
microfilm reader printers, etc.Fig. 18 shows a schematic structure of an example
of the electronic apparatus including a display device
as a part of the apparatus body. The apparatus of this
example is an electronic filing system
and corresponds to what is disclosed in EP-A-0 364 827.Reference numeral 80 designates the apparatus
body and 1 a display device set on the front surface of
the apparatus body. This example employs a thin
display device such as a liquid crystal display device
in order to construct the entire apparatus in a compact
size. The display device is fixed in a fixed angular
posture at a predetermined angle to the apparatus body
80.Numeral 2 denotes a document mount portion
projecting this side from the front surface of
apparatus below the display device 1. Sheet documents 
S are loaded on the document mount portion 2. The
loaded documents S are fed one by one from the top by a
sheet feed roller 3, and a document is separated by a
separator composed of a reversing roller 4 and a
feeding roller 5 to be drawn into the apparatus body
80. Alternatively, a document S may be supplied by
hand through the document mount portion 2 into a sheet
feed port 2a, so that the hand-supplied document is
drawn into the apparatus body 80 by the sheet feed
roller 3 and the separator 4, 5.The document S drawn into the apparatus body 80
is conveyed from bottom to top in the apparatus body 80
through a path of from a pair of guide plates 12, 13,
via a pair of conveying rollers 6, 7 and another pair
of conveying rollers 8, 9 to a pinch-and convey belt
apparatus 14, 15, and then is discharged onto a
discharge tray portion 16 provided this side of the
upper surface of the apparatus body 80.In the conveying process of this document first
and second image reading units 10, 11 set on either
side of the conveying path photoelectrically read image
information on the front side and on the back side of
the document at first and second reading positions A,
B, respectively, between the paired conveying rollers
6, 7 and the paired conveying rollers 8, 9. The first
and second image reading units 10, 11 each consist of a
document illumination light source, mirrors for guiding 
image light, an imaging lens, and an image

to said apparatus body (80);

characterized in that

the apparatus further comprises:
first hinge portions (70A) for directly, pivotally connecting one end of
said display device (1) to said apparatus body (80), said first hinge

portions (70A) being changeable between a state where it connects said
apparatus body (80) and said display device (1) and a state where it

does not connect said apparatus body (80) and said display device (1);
second hinge portions (70B) for directly, pivotally connecting the other end
of said display device (1) to said apparatus body (80), said second hinge

portions (70B) being changeable between a state where it connects said
apparatus body (80) and said display device (1) and a state where it

does not connect said apparatus body (80) and said display device (1);

wherein
said first hinge portion (70A) is keeping said display device (1) at a first
posture when said display device (1) and said apparatus body (80) are

directly connected through said first hinge means (70A) and are
unconnected through said second hinge portions (70B), and
said second hinge portion (70B) is keeping said display device (1) at a
second posture different from said first posture when said display device

(1) and said apparatus body (80) are connected through said second hinge 
portions and unconnected through said first hinge portions (70A); and
means for selectively releasing the connections of either said first hinge
portions (70A) or said second hinge portions (70B).
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein

said first hinge portions (70A) and said second hinge portions (70B) are
provided in upper and lower portions of the display device, respectively,

whereby a display surface of the display device can be inclined upward or
downward.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein

said first hinge portions (70A) and said second hinge portions (70B) are
provided in left and right portions of the display device, respectively,

whereby a display surface of the display device can be inclined leftward or
rightward.
The apparatus according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein

said first hinge portions (70A) and said second hinge portions (70B)
each comprise a shaft (75) to become a rotational fulcrum, and a support

member (55, 55a, 55b) for rotatably supporting said shaft (75) and holding
