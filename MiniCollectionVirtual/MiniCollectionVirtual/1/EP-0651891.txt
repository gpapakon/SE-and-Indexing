<ABSTRACT>
Method and display for providing a magnified image of a two-dimensional, periodical image pattern. According to the invention, an apertured sheet is arranged in front of said two-dimensional, periodical image pattern preferably being in plane B and preferably in distance therefrom, said apertured sheet preferably also being in a plane A and in any direction to the plane having a centre distance between the apertures, which almost corresponds to the centre distance in the same direction in the plane B containing the periodical image pattern. As a result, a magnified image of said individual image element of the image pattern is obtained. Moreover, a stereoscopic depth effect may be obtained, if the apertured sheet and the image pattern are in different planes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of providing a magnified image of a periodical
image pattern on a preferably plane surface.US patent No. 4,878,735 discloses an optical imaging system comprising a first
plate with equidistantly arranged diffraction elements in form of lenses. After the
first plate with equidistantly arranged diffraction elements, a further plate also
with equidistantly arranged diffraction elements is arranged. The plates are placed
in parallel. By means of the first plate, a plurality of images of an object in an
image pattern is formed, as shown in Fig. 6. It appears from said Fig. that the
centrally arranged images of the object are smaller than the peripherally arranged
images of the same object. By means of said plurality of images, which at least
partially correspond to a periodical image pattern, and the subsequent plate a
magnified image of each of said images in the image pattern is generated. However,
a perspective image of the object is not obtained by this image generation
and two images are seen, if the almost periodical image pattern is viewed upon
with two eyes through the second plate. Thus, the known system is unable to give
a spatial impression with depth effect.The object of the invention is to show how to obtain a correctly spatial image and
according to the invention, said object is obtained by an apertured sheet with
diffraction or refraction elements, such as lenses or openings, being arranged in
front of the image pattern and at a distance therefrom, said apertured sheet being 
in one plane and in a given direction to the plane having a centre distance between
the elements which is different from, but almost corresponds to the centre
distance in the same direction on the plane containing the periodical image
pattern, the apertured sheet being slightly turned relative to the image pattern.The accurate periodicity provides the spatial effect of one image (a stereoscopic
image) when the arrangement is wiewed upon with two eyes. The advantage of
the centre distance of the periodical image pattern being slightly different from
the centre distance of the apertured sheet is that it is not necessary to stand
indefinitely far away from said arrangement.The sub-claims relate to particularly advantageous embodiments of the method.The invention further relates to a use of the method according to the invention for
providing a magnified image of a periodical image pattern, which may be exposed.
