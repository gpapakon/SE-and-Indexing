<ABSTRACT>
To cut sheets (1) out of a web of material (2) precisely in terms of register and format, two separate transverse cutters (39, 40) are provided directly one after the other in the running direction (11), which cutters, in mutual dependence as well as in dependence on the web-length measuring system of an upstream drawing-in device (47), firstly cut the leading end of the web of material (2) in one plane (42) and directly afterwards separate the trailing end of the sheet (1) from the web of material (2) in a further plane (41). The length of the sheets (1) can thus be maintained with high precision at a high operating speed.
