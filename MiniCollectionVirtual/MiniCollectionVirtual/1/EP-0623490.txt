<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a roof rack for motor vehicles with roof rails, with a transverse carrier (1) and a bracing device (2). For the purpose of reliable bracing, irrespective of the given cross-section of the rail tube (3), it is provided that the supporting jaws (7) are located towards the outer side of the vehicle and the bracing jaws (8) are located towards the centre of the vehicle, that the bracing jaws (8) are in each case designed in the manner of a two-armed lever which can pivot approximately centrally around a horizontally aligned articulation spindle (19) which passes through in each case one supporting jaw (7), that each bracing jaw (8) exhibits an upper jaw part (24) which passes through a through-passage opening (20) in the associated supporting jaw (7) and one of the longitudinal slots (6) of the transverse carrier (1), and that the respectively lower jaw part (25), designed as a bow part, can pivot with respect to the assigned rail tube (3) by way of a longitudinal displacement of the associated screw (12) acting, by its free end, on the upper jaw part (24).

Roof rack for motor vehicles with roof rails, the 
roof rails comprising two rail tubes (3) running longitudinally 

along the vehicle roof on both sides of the 
vehicle, with a cross-member (1), as the crossbar of the 

roof rack, which extends from one rail tube (3) to the 
other, and the cross-member (1) is a hollow profile 

having a respective longitudinal slot (6) arranged on its 
underside and in each end region of the cross-member (1), 

with a respective releasable clamping device (2) in each 
end region of the cross-member (1) for fastening the 

cross-member (1) on the rail tubes (3), there being 
inserted, as holding means and clamping device, into each 

longitudinal slot (6) a respective supporting jaw (7) and 
a clamping jaw (8), in each case an upper jaw part (9, 

24) lying in the hollow profile and a lower jaw part (10, 
25) protruding downwards, the supporting jaws (7) being 

fixed on the cross-member (1) at the same spacing as the 
rail tubes (3), and in the upper jaw part (9) having a 

threaded hole (11) which is accessible from the end side 
of the cross-member and runs in the longitudinal direction 

of the cross-member, and each clamping jaw (8), the 
lower jaw part (25) of which is designed as a curved 

part, being movable, by means of a screw bolt (12) guided 
in a longitudinally displaceable manner in the threaded 

hole (11) of the supporting jaw (7), against the assigned 
rail tube (3) in order at least partially to surround the 

latter so as to hold the cross-member (1) when the 
clamping devise (2) is being fastened and the screw bolt 

(11) tightened, characterized in that the supporting jaws  
 

(7) lie towards the outside of the vehicle and the 
clamping jaws (8) lie towards the centre of the vehicle, 

in that the clamping jaws (8) are each designed in the 
manner of a two-armed lever which can be pivoted approximately 

centrally around a horizontally directed pivot pin 
(19) passing in each case through a supporting jaw (7), 

in that each clamping jaw (8) has an upper jaw part (24) 
which passes through a through-opening (20) in the 

relevant supporting jaw (7) as well as one of the longitudinal 
slots (6) of the cross-member (1), and in that 

the respectively lower jaw part (25), which is designed 
as a curved part, can be pivoted against the associated 

rail tube (3) by longitudinal displacement of the 
relevant screw (12) acting with its free end on the upper 

jaw part (24). 
Roof rack according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the supporting jaws (7) each have an extension (16) 

which is directed towards the centre of the vehicle and 
one side of which is supported on the cross-member (1) 

and on the other side of which, which faces away from the 
cross-member (1), are seated two bearing supports (17) 

between which a clamping jaw (8) is mounted, the through-opening 
(20) for the upper jaw part (24) of the clamping 

jaw (8) being located between the bearing supports (17). 
Roof rack according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that both the supporting jaws (7) and the clamping 

jaws (8) bear supports (27, 28) on their regions 
which come to rest against the rail tubes (3), which 

supports are made of a material which is softer than the 
material of the jaws.
