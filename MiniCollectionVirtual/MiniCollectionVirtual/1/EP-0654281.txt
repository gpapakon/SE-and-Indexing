<ABSTRACT>
A safety shield is provided for a medical 
implement having a needle cannula (14). The safety shield 

includes a guard (40) that is slidably movable along the 
needle cannula (14) from a proximal position where the tip (18) 

of the needle cannula (14) is exposed to a distal position 
where the tip (18) of the needle cannula (14) is safety 

shielded. A hinged arm (54) connects the guard (40) to a hub 
of the needle cannula (14) or to the medical implement 

with which the needle cannula (14) is used. The hinged 
arm (54) can be collapsed upon itself, such that the guard (40) 

is adjacent the hub (20) of the needle cannula (14). 
Alternatively, the hinged arm (54) can be extended to 

cause the guard (40) to move distally along the needle 
cannula (14) and into a position for shielding the tip (18) of 

the needle cannula (4). A spring (90) may be provided to 
assist movement of the guard (40) toward the distal 

shielded position.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention.
The subject
invention relates to single-handedly actuatable
safety shields for hypodermic needles, blood
collection needles, catheter needles and other
medical implements to prevent accidental needle
sticks.2. Description of the Prior Art.
Accidental
sticks with a used needle cannula can transmit
disease. As a result, most prior art needle cannulas
have a safety shield. Some prior art safety shields
define a rigid cap that can be telescoped in a
proximal direction over the used needle cannula.
This reshielding procedure requires the health care
worker to hold the needle cannula and the associated
medical implement in one hand and the shield in the
other. A slight misalignment as the hands move
toward one another may cause the accidental needle
stick that the shield is intended to avoid.
Additionally, many medical procedures require the
application of pressure to the penetration site after
the needle has been removed. Thus, health care
workers often are unable to use both hands for
shielding the needle cannula. In these situations,
workers may merely deposit the used medical implement
on a nearby surface, with the intention of completing 
the shielding at a more convenient time. However,
the subsequent reshielding often is neglected and a
contaminated needle may lie exposed in an area where
people are working.Some prior art needle shields are hingedly
attached to the hub of the needle cannula. These
prior art shields extend orthogonal to the needle
cannula prior to and during use. After use, the
shield is rotated 90Â° into a position where the
needle cannula is protectively enclosed. Shields of
this type can interfere with the usage of a
hypodermic syringe or other medical instrument, and
can visually obscure the tip of the needle cannula
during use. An unobstructed view of the point of
penetration is important for many medical procedures.
In particular, the health care worker often will want
to align the medical instrument with the bevel facing
the worker as the needle cannula is inserted. This
is difficult under the best of circumstances due to
the small diameter of the needle cannula. Problems
of aligning the bevel are greater if the needle
cannula is obscured by a large hingedly attached
shield.Some prior art hypodermic syringes include a
shield telescoped around the needle cannula or around
a longer-than-normal needle hub. The shield is
advanced distally after the hypodermic syringe has
been used. This prior art assembly with the shield
telescoped on the needle hub is

<CLAIMS>
A shieldable needle assembly (12) comprising:

a needle cannula (14) having a proximal end (16) and a distal tip (18);
a guard (40) having a proximal end (47), an opposed distal end (48) and a side wall
(46) extending therebetween, said guard (40) being slidably movable along said needle

cannula (14) from a first position substantially adjacent said proximal end (16) of said needle
cannula (14) to a second position where said distal tip of said needle cannula is intermediate

said opposed proximal and distal ends (47,48) of said guard (40);
a hinged arm (54) having proximal and distal segments (56, 58) articulated to one
another for movement between a first position where said segments (56, 58) are substantially

collapsed onto one another and a second position where said segments (56, 58) are extended
from one another, said proximal segment (56) of said hinged arm (54) being articulated to a

portion of said needle assembly (12) adjacent said proximal end (16) of said needle cannula
(14), said distal segment (58) of said hinged arm (54) being articulated to said guard (40),

said proximal and distal segments of said hinged arm (54) having respective lengths for
permitting said guard (40) to move from said first position to said second position on said

needle cannula (14), and for preventing said guard (40) from moving distally beyond said
