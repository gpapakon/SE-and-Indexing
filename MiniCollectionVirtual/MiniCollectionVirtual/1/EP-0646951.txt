<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor layer structure comprises 
a first semiconductor layer (1), and a second semiconductor 

layer (2) adjacent the first layer at a boundary. The 
first semiconductor layer has a uniform lattice 

constant in its layering direction. The second 
semiconductor layer has a distributed lattice constant 

varying in its layering direction. Each region of the 
second semiconductor layer (2) is strained due to biaxial 

strain introduced by a difference in lattice constant 
between each region and the first semiconductor 

layer. The strain in the second semiconductor layer 
has a distribution such that no crystal defects occur in 

the second semiconductor layer when the second layer is 
thicker than a critical thickness defined by the maximum 

strain in the second layer. The strained semiconductor 
layer structure may be used as a light confinement 

layer in a semiconductor optical device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor layer structure having distributed strain.Conventional strained lattice or superlattice structures include a plurality of kinds of semiconductor layers having different lattice constants layered with internal stresses left in the layers. Techniques for utilizing the strained lattice in an optical device, such as a semiconductor laser or a semiconductor optical amplifier, have been proposed, and using those techniques improves performance of various devices.However, when introducing strain into the semiconductor layer to achieve the strained lattice, it is necessary to avoid introducing lattice defects. For this reason, the thickness, up to which the strained lattice can be constructed, is limited. This is called a critical thickness. The critical thickness has been theoretically and experimentally studied by, for example, Matthew et al. "J. Crystal Growth", 27 (1974) p.118, and Fox et al. "J. Crystal Growth", 109 (1991) p.252.If the strained lattice is layered above the critical thickness, the strain begins to be partially relaxed owing to the occurrence of lattice defects. If the layer thickness is further increased, the strain will become completely relaxed. As a result, the lattice constant proper to the layered semiconductor layer appears and the strain will disappear.Therefore, in a technical field wherein strain is a desired property, a semiconductor layer with strain therein typically must have a maximum thickness below the critical thickness. Furthermore, the critical thickness decreases as the lattice mismatching between layers increases resulting in a greater amount of strain. Therefore, use of the strained lattice is limited to relatively thin layers and it is generally used in combination with a quantum well structure. A strained lattice may be employed as a well layer, a barrier layer or a multi-layer in which those well layers and barrier layers are alternated.As discussed above, a thick layer has rarely been constructed with strain existing therein, and use of such a layer has not been contemplated. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that document US 5 159 603 discloses a surface emitting semiconductor laser with a strained or pseudomorphic graded index separate confinement heterostructure (GRINSCH) and incorporating a single quantum well (SOW) active layer, where the lattice mismatch is accommodated by an elastic deformation of the lattice.It is an object of the present invention to provide a layer structure device, into which strain is
