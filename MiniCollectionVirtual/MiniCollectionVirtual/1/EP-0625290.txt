<ABSTRACT>
Uncased three-phase motors with square stator lamination sets are cooled via axial cooling channels. Cooling must be further improved. For that purpose, the stream of cooling air is to be used as effectively as possible and the cross-section of the set of stator laminations is to be made as small as possible. This is achieved in that there are longitudinal and transverse cooling fins (2, 3) in the region of a cooling air window (1) and the cooling air apertures (4) thus formed have, apart from the technologically required production aperture (6) in the outermost corner region, continuous ribs (5) on at least three sides. The set of stator laminations is suitable in particular for three-phase main drive motors.
