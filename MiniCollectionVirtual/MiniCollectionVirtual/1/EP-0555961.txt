<ABSTRACT>
An absolute encoder wherein tracks (3-1, 3-2) 
are arranged side-by-side on a magnetic drum (1) in 

the axial direction thereof, and absolute patterns 
of circulatory random sequence codes are divided and 

recorded on the tracks (3-1, 3-2), respectively. 
An additional track (3-3) for generating sinewaves 

of two phases in synchronism with the reading of the 
absolute patterns is provided on the magnetic drum 

(1), so that an output can be obained by combining 
a coarse value of an absolute position obtained from 

the tracks (3-1, 3-2) and a fine value of an 
absolute position obtained from the additional track 

(3-3). The absolute patterns are detected from the 
two tracks (3-1, 3-2) recorded on the magnetic drum 

(1) by magnetic resistive elements (MR) connected 
with each other to form circuits each having a 

three-terminal. Terminals of the magnetic resistive 
elements (MR) are connected through a common line 

with an electric power source in order to prevent 
the lines from being crossed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an encoder, 
and more particularly relates to an absolute encoder 
wherein an output of a rotary member is coded, so 
that an absolute position of the rotary member can 
be detected directly. A magnetic type absolute encoder is formed by 
combining a detector utilizing magneto-resistive 
elements (which will hereinafter be referred 
as MR elements) with a magnetic drum on which 
magnetic patterns of more than two rows are recorded 
magnetically as described in Japanese Patents Laid-Open 
Nos. 54-118259 and 62-83619. In general, magnetic patterns of n tracks are 
necessary in order to obtain a resolution of 2n in 
such absolute encoder. Accordingly, as shown in Figs. 23 and 24, a 
plurality of tracks 30 (six in this case) are disposed on an outer peripheral 
surface of a magnetic drum 1, informations of three bits are recorded on 
said tracks 30, and a magnetic sensor 20 having MR elements 
(R01, R01, ---) of a number corresponding to said three bits are disposed 
facing the magnetic drum 1, so that an absolute value can be obtained by 
combining signals from the plural MR elements.  
 Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-24513 discloses 
an absolute encoder wherein absolute signals can be 
obtained from tracks having absolute patterns. However, it is necessary to arrange parallely a 
plurality of tracks on the magnetic drum 1 in the 
axial direction thereof, as shown in Fig. 23, in 
order to increase the resolution of the absolute 
encoder of the prior art, such as an absolute encoder 
shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 62-83619, 
thereby causing the absolute encoder large in size. Further, it is necessary to describe informations 
of 2n on one track in order to obtain a resolution 
of 2n, for example, in an absolute encoder using 
circulatory random sequence codes, so that 
the absolute encoder must be made precisely in 
dimension and becomes expensive. I.E.E.E. Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 1987, No. 
4, pages 950-955 entitled "Absolute-Type Position Transducers Using a 
Pseudorandom Encoding" describes the application of pseudorandom 
sequences to the encoding of absolute type position transducers. An 
absolute 360-position shaft encoder illustrates the features of the 
pseudorandom encoding technique. In the conventional absolute position detecting 
method described above, a plurality of absolute 
patterns are recorded on the peripheral surface of 
the magnetic drum in the circumferential direction 
thereof and MR elements corresponding thereto are
