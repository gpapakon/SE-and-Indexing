<ABSTRACT>
A pattern projecting method is disclosed. The pattern 
projecting method has the step of illuminating a mask having a 

fine pattern formed therein with an exposure light and causing 
a transmitted light of the mask to be incident on a pupil of a 

projection optical system to project an image of the fine pattern 
onto a substrate, the illuminating step using an effective light 

source capable of achieving such light intensity distribution as 
to provide a predetermined light intensity in a central region 

of the pupil, a maximum light intensity in plural peripheral 
regions around the central region, and a light intensity lower 

than the maximum light intensity in a region connecting the 
plural regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pattern projecting method
adapted for projecting a fine circuit pattern of a semiconductor
device onto a wafer, and particularly to the method for avoiding
deterioration of depth of focus dependent upon the pattern and
irregularity in illuminance.In manufacture of the semiconductor device, the 16 MDRAM
based upon the design rule of half micron (0.5 µm) level has
already been on a mass production line. In research on the
semiconductor device, processing of sub-half micron (up to 0.35
µm) level required for the 64 MDRAM and quarter micron (0.25 µm)
level required for the 256 MDRAM has been studied. An essential
technique for such fine processing is photolithography. The
resolution of an exposure device, particularly of a reduced
projection exposure device (referred to as a stepper) used for
photolithography, determines the possibility of research,
development and mass production of the semiconductor device.Conventionally, the resolution in photolithography has been
improved by shortening the exposure wavelength and increasing the
numerical aperture of a projection lens of the stepper. This
improvement is apparent from the relation shown by the following 
Equation I, known as Rayleigh's formula:
R = k1 × λ / NA
wherein R denotes the resolution, k1 the process coefficient, λ
the exposure wavelength, and NA the numerical aperture of the
projection lens of the stepper.In manufacturing the semiconductor device, the resolution
(R) and the depth of focus (DOF) are also important parameters
for the following reason. Since the wafer surface onto which a
pattern is to be projected has irregularities generated therein
by warping of the pattern or the wafer, the photoresist coating
film cannot be exposed on the same single focal plane at every
position in the wafer surface or in the same chip. The depth of
focus (DOF) is expressed by the following Equation II:
DOF = k2 × λ / (NA)2
wherein k2 denotes the process coefficient.The depth of focus (DOF) of approximately 1.5 µm is
preferred in the mass production.From the above Equation II, it is found that the resolution
(R) is limited up to about 0.35 µm to achieve the DOF of 1.5 µm
using a KrF excimer laser beam with a wavelength λ = 248 nm.
Stated differently, the required resolution and depth of focus
are in the relation of trade-off. It is therefore extremely
difficult to resolve a line width finer than 0.35 µm while
achieving the focal depth of not less than 1.5 µm.Thus, it has been attempted recently to eliminate the above 
difficulty by
