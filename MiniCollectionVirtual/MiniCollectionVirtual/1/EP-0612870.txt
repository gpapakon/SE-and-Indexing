<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing mesophase pitch based carbon 
fibers is disclosed, wherein mesophase pitch fibers are 

gas-phase nitrated in an atmosphere of an oxygen-containing 
gas such as air or an inert gas such as nitrogen containing 

0.1 to 50 % by volume of NO₂ at a low temperature of not 
higher than 100 °C for a long period of time. The carbon 

fibers thus obtained are excellent in both mechanical 
strength and elastic modulus and have well-balanced 

physical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an improvement in a
process for producing carbon fibers from a mesophase pitch.More particularly, the invention provides an
improvement in a process for producing carbon fibers from a
mesophase pitch, which includes a stage of gas-phase
nitrating pitch fibers with a NO2 gas at a low temperature
of not higher than 100 °C to infusibilize the pitch fibers.Pitch based carbon fibers have been conventionally
obtained by a process comprising the steps of spinning a
pitch into pitch fibers, air-oxidizing the pitch fibers at
a reaction temperature of from about 200 to 400 °C in air
to prepare infusibilized pitch fibers, and then heat-treating
the infusibilized pitch fibers at a high
temperature to carbonize and/or graphitize them.However, because such infusibilization reaction by
means of air-oxidation as described above never
proceeds when the reaction temperature is lower than 150
°C, the air-oxidation must be carried out at a high
temperature.For this reason, infusibilization techniques utilizing
liquid-phase oxidation effective even at a low temperature 
have been developed. In these techniques, however, there
is involved a problem in that the surface layer portions
of the fibers are excessively oxidized which can lower
the mechanical properties of the
carbon fibers obtained from pitch (see: Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Publications No. 118917/1974, No. 30915/1984, No.
231825/1985, No. 502772/1986, No. 242919/1990, etc).Japanese Patent Publication No. 42696/1973 describes a
method of infusibilizing pitch fibers obtained from a
specific pitch, e.g., pitch material containing a high
aromatic content or a hydrogenation product thereof, at a
temperature of not lower than about 110 °C in a nitrogen
oxide-containing oxidizing gas atmosphere. However, this
method can be applied only to the above-mentioned specific
pitch material, and any possibility of an application to
such a mesophase (optically anisotropic) pitch as used in
the invention is not suggested at all.Further, in the above-mentioned Japanese Patent
Publication No. 42696/1973, the technical idea that the
mesophase pitch fibers are completely infusibilized by only
treating them with NO2 at a low temperature is never
illustrated, though the treatment with NO2 at a low
temperature described in this publication is significant as
a pretreatment for the infusibilization of the pitch fibers
with air.Japanese Patent Publication No. 12740/1976 discloses a
method of infusibilizing pitch fibers obtained from a 
fiber-forming pitch such
