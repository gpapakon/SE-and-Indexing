<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to food and beverage
packagings and, more particularly, to oxygen barrier
laminate structures for producing aseptic packagings and
containers.Heat-sealable low density polyethylenes are popular
components of current paperboard food and non-food
packagings and containers. To provide a suitable barrier
to oxygen and light transmission, structures with
materials such as aluminum foil have been utilized in the
production of these paperboard packagings. However, the
unrestricted use of aluminum foil in any packaging
renders that packaging non-microwaveable.Oxygen permeability is a key consideration in aseptic,
shelf-stable packaging because if oxygen is allowed to
react with a food or beverage product it can result in
deterioration of many aspects of product quality.
Attempts have been made to produce an oxygen barrier
container without the use of aluminum foil. EP-A-0 293 098
discloses a container in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, suitable for packaging juices
and prepared from a laminate structure without the use of foil , said laminate stucture consisting of
paperboard, low density polyethylene polymer (LDPE),
ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH), and tie layers
e.g. made of Plexar®. This laminate is utilized for the
containment of essential oils and juices. The structure
has the requirement that the laminate used to form the
container must have a very thin inner or product contact 
layer (17.78 µm (0.7 mil) or less) of low density
polyethylene (LDPE) in order to achieve its desired
results of minimizing absorption of essential flavor oils
contained in citrus juice and other beverage products.
Such a thin product contact layer is not acceptable in
the aseptic packaging of the present invention because it
cannot provide for commercial sterilization.The present invention involves aseptic packaging which
means commercially sterile packaging having no living
microorganisms capable of growth inside the sealed
container.Aseptic packaging can provide shelf life of up to a year
or more prior to opening without the need for
preservatives or refrigeration. Conversely traditional
gable top cartons (commonly used for the non-aseptic
packaging of milk and juice) rely an refrigeration to
retard microbial activity. But even under refrigeration,
the shelf life of milk or juice in a non-aseptic carton
is limited, in part due to the lack of adequate package
seals for keeping the product isolated from outside
microorganisms.The product contact surface of aseptic packaging is
ster

<CLAIMS>
An aseptic container prepared from an oxygen barrier
laminate structure (10, 40), said laminate structure (10,

40) comprising:

a paperboard (12, 42) having an inner surface (13, 43)
and an outer surface (11, 41);
a first low density polyethylene layer (14, 44) coated on
said outer surface (11, 41) of said paperboard (12, 42);
a multi-layer coextrusion (20, 50) having an inner
surface (27, 57) and an outer surface (21, 51) wherein

said outer surface (21, 51) of said multi-layer
coextrusion (20, 50) is coated interior to said

paperboard (12, 42), said multi-layer coextrusion (20,
50) comprising a first adhesive tie layer (22, 52), an

oxygen barrier material layer (24, 54) and a second
adhesive tie layer (26, 56); and
a second low density polyethylene layer (32, 64) coated
on said inner surface (27, 57) of said multi-layer

coextrusion (20, 50),
characterized in that

said second low density polyethylene layer (32, 64) has a
thickness of at least 35.56 x 10
-6
 m (1.4 mil). 
The container of claim 1 wherein said oxygen barrier
material layer (24, 54) is an ethylene vinyl alcohol

copolymer.
The container of claim 2 wherein said adhesive tie
layers (22, 26, 52, 56) are an ethylene-based copolymer

with functional groups.
The container of claim 3 said ethylene-based
copolymer with functional groups is Plexar 177

(registered trade mark).
The container of claim 2 wherein said oxygen barrier
material layer (24, 54) is at least 10 g/m
2
 thick.
The container of claim 1, further comprising means for
substantially controlling light transmission through said

container.
The container of claim 1 wherein

said first low density polyethylene layer (14, 44) is of
a thickness of about 15.24 x 10
-6
 m (0.6 mil);

wherein said multi-layer coextrusion (20, 50) of a total
thickness of about 27.94 x 10
-6
 m (1.1 mil) comprises said
first adhesive tie layer (22, 52) about 10.16 x 10
-6
 m
(0.4 mil) thick, an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer as

oxygen barrier layer (24, 54) about 7.62 x 10
-6
 m (0.3
mil) thick, and a second adhesive tie layer about 10.16 x

10
-6
 m (0.4 mil) thick, coated in the order listed; and

wherein 
any voids are filled and caulked by said

second low density polyethylene layer (32, 64) to
provide a biological seal and a sterilizable

inner surface to said container.
The container of claim 7, further comprising: a photic
barrier layer (62) of low density polyethylene coated on

said inner surface (57) of said multi-layer coextrusion
(50), wherein said photic barrier layer (62) is about

10.16 x 10
-6
 m (0.4 mil) thick.
