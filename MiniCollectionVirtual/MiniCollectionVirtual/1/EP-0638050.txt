<ABSTRACT>
A system for the treatment or treatment and retreatment of contaminated fluid waste (e.g., Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6), comprising a source or reservoir of contaminated waste (4) linked to a fluid discharge or circulation network of pipes, means (5) in the network for urging the contaminated fluid waste through the network, characterised in that the treatment and retreatment is effected by the insertion into the said network of at least one receptacle or housing (1) adapted to receive therein a preselected blend (3') of at least a carbonaceous powder, a first adsorptive fibrous material and a second adsorptive fibrous material to form a cartridge (2) which is permeable to the said fluid. The invention also relates to the cartridge (2) of the filter material (3').

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to filtration 
cartridges and more particularly relates to cartridges for 
use in removing contaminants and impurities from effluents. The vexing problem of removal and disposal of 
contaminants and impurities from industrial wastes has 
existed for some time. Many attempts have been made to 
filter liquid industrial wastes so that the filtered 
liquid may be of a quality suitable for discharge into the 
sewer mains or as acceptable secondary effluent into water 
courses. According to another method of waste disposal, 
unfiltered noxious wastes are often dumped in certified 
waste disposal dumps however, very little is known about 
the possible deleterious effects on the water cycle that 
dumping liquid wastes in this way may cause irrespective 
of the coefficient of permeability of the soil in which 
the wastes are deposited. The same lack of knowledge on 
full environmental effects exists in relation to 
contaminated liquids discharged into water courses and 
oceans. This has forced the relevant authorities to 
review existing standards so that effluent qualities must 
be improved. Many industries have, in the past, used filtration 
plants and other types of process plants, (e.g. Dissolved 
Air Floatation, Coalescent inclined Plate Pak, Chemical 
Dosing, etc.), to treat effluents however, the results of 
treatment vary considerably according to the type of 
plants used and the nature of the contaminant impurity to 
be removed from a particular effluent. This has led to development of many different types 
of adsorbant filter cartridges for use in filtration 
plants. The cartridges differ in configuration and in the 
material which is used to effect the filtration. They are 
generally disposable and have varying life spans which are 
related to the nature of the material which is to be 
filtered. The life of the filter is related to the 
surface area used to remove particulates, slimes, oil, 
etc. and in the case of contaminants to be removed from  
 
solution, to the adsorption characteristics of the filter 
material and to the total adsorptive surface area made 
available by the filter material. Among the prior art cartridges are those which have 
pleated synthetic material which is intended to present a 
large surface area to the liquid being filtered for the 
removal of particulates. The larger the surface area the 
greater the potential life of a filter. These filters 
have been used with some success, however, their life is 
reduced due to clogging of the filter

A system for the treatment and retreatment of 
contaminated fluid waste comprising: 


a source of contaminated waste linked to a circulation 
network of pipes, 
means in the network for urging the contaminated fluid 
waste from the source through the network, 
 
   characterised in that the network comprises at least one 

receptacle containing a filter blend comprising 5% to 35% 
carbonaceous powder, 20% to 60% of a first adsorptive fibre 

material and 20% to 60% of a second adsorptive fibre material, the 
blend having a greater amount of the first fibre material and 

second fibre material combined compared to the amount of the 
carbonaceous powder to form a cartridge which is permeable to the 

fluid. 
A system according to claim 1 wherein said cartridges are 
disposed in the network in series, in parallel, or in series and 

in parallel between the source and the outlet of the network. 
A system according to claim 2 further comprising 
pretreatment filters upstream of the cartridges. 
A system according to claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the blend 
has a permeability which allows the passage of the waste through 

the cartridge at a velocity within the range 0.01 cm/sec to 1.0 
cm/sec. 
A system according to any preceding claim wherein the 
filtration of the waste is effected by attraction of the waste 

onto the surfaces of the particulate constituents of the blend. 
A filter blend for use in treatment of contaminated fluid  
 

waste comprising 5% to 35% carbonaceous powder, 20% to 60% of a 
first adsorptive fibre material and 20% to 60% of a second 

adsorptive fibre material, the blend having a greater amount of 
the first fibre material and second fibre material combined 

compared to the amount of the carbonaceous powder. 
A filter blend according to claim 6 wherein the first and 
second fibre materials comprise spiky skeletal fibres. 
A housing including a filter blend according to claim 7. 
A housing according to claim 8 wherein the blend is 

contained in at least one filtration element cavity in the housing 
and which is concentric about an inner core. 
A housing according to claim 9 wherein the velocity of 
liquid passing through the inner core falls within the range of 

0.01 cm/sec to 1.0 cm/sec. 
A housing according to claim 10 wherein the filtration 
element is sandwiched between two permeable filaments. 
A housing according to claim 11 wherein the filtration 
element comprises a series of modular panels having the blend 

therein and sandwiched between permeable filaments.
