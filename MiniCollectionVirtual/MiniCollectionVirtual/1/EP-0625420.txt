<ABSTRACT>
During the extrusion of a sized (gauged) strip made of a thermoplastic, interruptions in the flow of molten material produce thickness non-uniformities in the profiled strip. The method of the invention provides for keeping a constant flow of molten material between the extruder (17) and the extrusion head (6). The device includes a three-way valve (30) which progressively directs the flow of molten material to a drain channel (35) when the extrusion head (6) stops.

Method for extruding a calibrated profiled section (3)
made from thermoplastic polymer on a support (1), in which the

support is positioned in the working area of a robot (5), a
method which affords the fusion of a polymer in an extruder

(17) and its transportation by means of a high-pressure
heating pipe (22) as far as a heated extrusion head (6) guided

by a robot (5) and its placing on the support (1),
characterised in that it includes, between the transportation

of the polymer and its extrusion, passage through a three-way
valve (30, 32) in order to orient the flow of material either

to a nozzle (9) or to a discharge duct (28), the said valve
having a space or recess (60, 68) which keeps the feed duct

(26) in connection with the nozzle (9) and discharge duct (28)
during the switching in the three-way valve.
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
discharged molten material is recycled in the extruder.
Method according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
discharged molten material is re-introduced into the extruder

by means of a pump (37) and a return duct (35).
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
discharged molten material is cooled and granulated.
Method according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
granules are transported to the feed hopper (16) for the

extruder (17) in order to be re-introduced therein.
Device for extruding a calibrated profiled section made of
thermoplastic polymer on a support (1) and having an extruder

(17) supplying molten material, in succession a high-pressure
heating pipe (22) and an extrusion head (6) with a feed duct

(26) and a nozzle (9) which is moved by a robot (5) on the 
support, characterised in that the extrusion head (6) has a

feed duct (26) through which the molten material circulates
and a three-way valve (30) in order to orient it either

towards the nozzle (9) or towards the discharge duct (28), and
in that the three-way valve (30, 32) is equipped with a space

or recess (60, 68) which keeps the feed duct (26) in
connection with the nozzle (9) and the discharge duct (28)

during the switching in the three-way valve.
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in that the
three-way valve (30) has a core (49) which is in the shape of

a ball with a diameter less than that of the internal space
(58) in which it is situated, which forms a space (60) between

the core (49) and the wall of the internal space (58), and in
that the core (49) is able to move in rotation about a hollow

vortex (51) serving for the entry of the molten material and
which is extended by an angled duct (52) inside the core (49),

the duct opening out, when the core (49) is in one of the
extreme positions, on an annular bearing surface (61) forming

a seal around one of the outlets (54, 28) and designed so
that, when the core leaves its extreme position, the angled

duct (52) is partially in communication with the space (60),
itself in communication with the other outlet (28, 54).
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in that the
three-way valve (32) has a core (65) which is substantially

cylindrical, in rotation about its axis and having pass
through it, perpendicularly to the said axis, a drilling (66)

which, in one of the extreme positions of the core, connects
the feed duct (26) for the molten material to one of the

outlets (54, 28), whilst the other one (28, 54) is closed off
by the core (65) itself, and in that the periphery of the

cylindrical core (65) has a recess (68) which begins to
connect the inlet for the molten material with the other

outlet as soon as the core (65) begins its movement.
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 8, characterised in 
that it is designed so that, at th
e end of one of the
extrusion phases, the movable extrusion head (6) puts the

discharge duct (28) in communication with a coupling (33)
through which the molten material is discharged.
Device according to Claim 9, characterised in that the
coupling (33) is connected to a high-pressure heating pipe

(35) and to a pump (37) which returns the molten material to
the extruder (17).
Device according to Claim 9, characterised in that the
coupling (33) is connected to a system for cooling and

manufacturing granules.
Device according to Claim 11, characterised in that a
pneumatic transporter system (44, 45) takes the granules to

the hopper (16) of the extruder (17).
