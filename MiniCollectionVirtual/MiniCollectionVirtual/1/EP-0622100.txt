<ABSTRACT>
A filter having improved means of positive shutoff employs a rigid tubular fuel 
pervious core surrounded by flexible filter media that intercepts and resists the passage 

of particulate matter and water. A tubular retention sleeve is positioned within and in 
dosed communication with the tubular core at one end thereof, the retention sleeve 

having an integral ball retention portion of reduced internal diameter. An end cap is 
sacred to the other end of the tubular core member and has an annular sealing surface 

surrounding a flow passageway opening therethrough. A ball is normally positioned 
within the retention sleeve and in the engagement with the circumferential ball retention 

seat. When the flexible filter media has absorbed a sufficient quantity of water the 
pressure differential across the ball forces it to pass through the retention seat and to 

lodge against the sealing surface of the end cap, thereby closing further flow through the 
filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
Fuel, such as jet fuel, diesel fuel and the like is seriously impaired if water becomes 
admixed with it. That is, most uses of fuel such as jet fuel, diesel fuel and so forth, such 
as in internal combustion engines, are very seriously affected by the presence of water 
in the fuel. First, of course, water is not combustible, and therefore, subtracts from the 
energy value available from a given quantity of fuel. Second, water freezes easily and can 
block fuel lines in cold environments. Third, water tends to carry with it contaminants and 
more readily reacts with metals to form rust. For these and other reasons, it is very 
important that in order to preserve high fuel quality water be prevented from traveling in 
a fuel flow system. A known expedient to intercept water in a fuel system is to provide a filter media 
of the type which permits fuel, such as jet fuel, diesel fuel or the like, to pass therethrough 
but which resists the passage of water. Filters of this type include hydrophilic materials 
which absorb and expand in the presence of water, but which are not olefinic, that is, 
which do not absorb hydrocarbons. This type of filter media is useful in blocking the flow 
of water since the absorption and expansion can serve to close the fitter media against 
the passage of fluid therethrough.  
 The use of a water absorbent filter media alone as a means of preventing the 
passage of water in a fuel flow system, however, is not sufficiently dependable. Instead, 
it is highly desirable that in a fuel flow filtering system a positive shutoff be provided so 
that when sufficient water is detected in a fuel flow system, such as by water absorbent 
fuel media swelling or otherwise reacting to resist the further fluid flow therethrough, a 
positive, mechanical type shutoff be obtained. U.S. Pat. No. 4,485,011 to Cole et al 
discloses a type of shutoff valve in conjunction with a fuel filter arrangement. In the 
device of the Cole et al patent a ball is maintained in a rest position as long as the 
pressure drop across a filter media is below a certain level, but is displaced when the 
pressure drop increases, such as occurs when the filter media absorbs water. The 
displaced ball is then passed to a valve closure position to stop further fluid flow through 
the filter. The present disclosure is directed towards an improvement in the basic concept 
of Cole et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,485,011. More particularly, this disclosure provides a 
structure for controlling the position of a shutoff ball within a

A filter having improved means of positive 
shutoff comprising: 


a rigid tubular fuel pervious core member (10) 
having a first end (14) and a second end (16); 
flexible filter media (12) surrounding said 
tubular core member (10) through which fuel freely 

passes from the exterior thereof into said tubular core 
member (10) but which resists the passage of particulate 

matter and water; 
a tubular retention sleeve (36) received co-axially 
and entirely within and in closed communication 

with said tubular core member (10) at said first end 
(14) thereof, the retention sleeve (36) having a first 

end (38) and a second end (40) and having an integral 
circumferential ball retention seat (44) of reduced 

internal diameter at said sleeve second end (40); 
an end cap (18) secured to said tubular core 
member (10) at said second end (16) thereof having an 

opening (20) therethrough in closed communication with 
said tubular core member second end (16), and having an 

annular sealing surface (24) surrounding said opening 
therethrough, the sealing surface (24) being capable of acting as a 

seat for a ball (46); and 
a ball (46) within said filter and normally 
within said tubular retention sleeve (36) and in sealed 

engagement with said circumferential ball retention seat (44) 
as fuel flows through said filter media (12) 

and into said tubular core member (10) and out through 
said end cap (18),
 
   characterised in that said tubular retention 

sleeve (36) is formed as an elongated thin wall tubular 
retention sleeve which is radially outwardly deformable 

to permit said ball (46) to pass said ball retention seat (44) 
when a predetermined pressure drop develops across  

 
said flexible filter media (12) to thereby cause said 

ball (46) to engage said annular sealing surface (24) of 
said end cap (18) to block further flow through the 

filter. 
A filter having improved means of positive 
shutoff as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 

end cap (18) secured to said core member (10) at said 
second end (16) is a second end cap (18), and that the filter further

a first end cap (30) having pressure port 
passageway (32) therethrough and being secured to said 

tubular core member (10) at said first end (14) thereof. 
A filter having improved means of positive 
shutoff as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that said 

retention sleeve first end (38) is secured to said first 
end cap (30) coaxially with said pressure port passageway 

(32).

that said retention sleeve (36) is formed of relatively 
thin, deformable metal or plastic material.

sleeve (36) is only slightly greater than the diameter of 

said ball (46) whereby said ball (46) fits snugly but 
movably within said retention sleeve (36).
