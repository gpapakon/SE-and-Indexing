<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for generating a symmetrical
output clock signal with odd division N of a symmetrical

input clock signal,

having a first means for generating a first output
signal from the symmetrical input clock signal, which

begins with the respective Nth edge of the first type of
the symmetrical clock signal and remains active for the

duration of  N-1 / 2 periods of the symmetrical clock
signal,
having a second means for generating a second output
signal from the symmetrical clock signal, which begins

with the respective Nth edge of the other type of the
symmetrical clock signal and remains active for the

duration of  N-1 / 2 periods of the symmetrical clock
signal,
having a logic arrangement, which logically combines
the two outward signals to form a symmetrical output

clock signal,

characterized in that

N+1 series-connected D latches (3, 4, 5, 6) are provided,
which are alternately clocked by the symmetrical

clock signal and the inverted symmetrical clock signal,
the output signals of the last D latch (6) and of the
next-to-last D latch (5) are fed to a NOR gate (7),
the output of the NOR gate (7) is connected to the 
input of the first D latch (3) and to an output terminal

(8).
