<ABSTRACT>
A method for the determination of the resistivity 
of an n-type epitaxial layer formed on a silicon 

substrate is disclosed. This invention resides in either 
directly determining the true resistivity of a sample 

by preparing this sample without a natural oxide film 
which is responsible for the change with the passage of 

time or indirectly determining the true resistivity of 
a sample by intentionally forming on the sample a 

natural oxide film so stable to defy the change with 
the passage of time and measuring resistivity of this 

sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the
determination of the resistivity of an n-type silicon
wafer. More particularly, this invention relates to a
method for the determination of the true resistivity of
an n-type silicon epitaxial layer by the four point
probe method.As a way of determining the resistivity of a
silicon epitaxial layer grown on a silicon substrate,
the four point probe method illustrated in Fig. 5 has
found wide spread acceptance.This method determines the resistivity of a sample
S by arranging four point probes 1 to 4 equidistantly
on the surface of the sample S, forming a flow of a
direct current I from the two outer probes to the
sample S, and measuring the voltage V which occurs
consequently between the two inner probes. In Fig. 10,
N stands for an n-type region, P for a p-type region, t
for the film thickness of an epitaxial layer, and 5 for
a p-n junction.By this method of determination, the resistivity ρ
of the epitaxial layer can be obtained in accordance
with the following formula (1): 
ρ = aRt
wherein a stands for the constant (π /ln2), R for the
sheet resistance of the epitaxial layer, and t for the
film thickness of the epitaxial layer.In the case of the n-type epitaxial layer, the
sheet resistance R is determined by obtaining growth of
this n-type epitaxial layer on a p-type silicon
substrate and actually measuring the sheet resistance by
the four point probe method. The film thickness t of
the epitaxial layer is generally determined by
measuring the film thickness of an epitaxial layer
which is grown on a high-concentration antimony
substrate in accordance with the Fourier-Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method. The resistivity ρ
is the product of R multiplied by t and a, a constant.Incidentally, the resistivity ρ (sheet
resistance R) is prone to the so-called time-course
change, a phenomenon that this magnitude increases
with the elapse of time, depending on the specification
of the n-type epitaxial layer to be manufactured. The
magnitude thus rising requires more than one week's time
before it is stabilized. The time-course change tends
to increase in accordance as the film thickness of the
epitaxial layer decreases and the resistivity increases.
By way of specific illustration, the results of a 
determination of the resistivity in accordance with the
conventional method will be described below.Wafers having epitaxial layers 10, 25, 37, and 64
µm in film thickness were severally produced by
growing an n-type <111> epitaxial layer of a target
resistivity of 30 Ω

<CLAIMS>
A method of determining the resistivity
of an n-type epitaxial layer formed on a silicon

substrate, characterised by subjecting the surface of
said n-type epitaxial layer to hydrogen termination and

then measuring by means of the four point probe method the sheet resistance of said surface of said
n-type epitaxial layer whilst still in the hydrogen terminated

state and calculating the resistivity therefrom.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein the
measurement of the sheet resistance of said n-type

epitaxial layer is accomplished by the steps of:
growing said n-type epitaxial layer on a silicon

substrate; displacing the inner gas of an epitaxial
growth reactor with hydrogen gas and cooling said

silicon substrate to a temperature below 400°C, thereby
effecting said hydrogen termination of the surface of

said n-type epitaxial layer; subsequently displacing
said hydrogen gas in said epitaxial growth reactor with

an inert gas and simultaneously cooling said silicon

substrate to normal room temperaure; removing said
cooled silicon substrate from said epitaxial growth

reactor; and measuring sheet resistance of said n-type
epitaxial layer by the four point probe method.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said n-type
epitaxial layer is contacted with a dilute

aqueous hydrofluoric acid solution to remove natural
oxide film formed on the surface of said n-type

epitaxial layer and, at the same time, effect said

dried, and subjected to measurement of said sheet

measurement being conducted in advance of any subsequent formation of an
oxide film on the surface of said n-type epitaxial 

layer .
A method according to any one of Claims 1, 2 and
3, wherein the sheet resistance measured

by the four point probe method is multiplied by the film
thickness of said n-type epitaxial layer, determined by

the Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
method or the spreading resistance method, and the

constant π/ln2 to obtain said resistivity.
