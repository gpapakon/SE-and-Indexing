<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides methods and apparatus
for the formation of heterogeneous ion-exchange membranes by

prescribed in-line compounding and extrusion of a polymeric
binder and heat sensitive ion-exchange resin. The ion-exchange

resin is incorporated, at a late process stage, into the melted
matrix polymer at relatively low temperature and residence t
ime
prior to transfer to a die head for extrusion. In the presently

preferred embodiment, the in-line compounding apparatus comprises
a twin-screw compounding extruder, for effecting late stage

kneading and mixing of ion-exchange resin and optional additives
to the polymer melt, prior to compression to transfer the blended

polymer melt to a die head for extrusion. Accordingly, the final
properties of the resultant heterogeneous ion-exchange membrane

are enhanced as the blended polymer melt material is not exposed
to excessive heat and shear history. Resultant heterogeneous

ion-exchange membranes and apparatus for treatment of fluid
streams utilizing such membranes are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides unique heterogeneous
ion-exchange membranes, methods and apparatus for producing such
membranes, and ion-removing apparatus utilizing such membranes.Purification of fluids such as water, beverages,
chemicals and waste streams can be accomplished in a variety of
different systems for a plurality of different end results. For
ultrapure and drinking water purposes, purification may require
the removal of substantial amounts of ions contained within
brackish or salt water, may require the removal of turbidity and
large particles, or may require the destruction of living
organisms. Such purification may also require removal of
substantial amounts of ions from reverse osmosis permeate and DI
permeate.For removal of ions, several basic systems have found
commercial acceptance: ion-exchange, reverse osmosis,
electrodialysis and electrodeionization.In general, established methods for deionizing fluids
include: distillation, ion exchange, electrodialysis, and
reverse osmosis. Distillation separates water from contaminants
by transferring water into vapor phase, leaving most contaminants
behind. Ion-exchange removes ions from solutions by exchange of 
salts for hydrogen and hydroxide ions. Electrodialysis uses
membranes that remove salts by ion transfer under the influence
of a direct electrical current. Reverse osmosis uses membranes
that are permeable to water but not to solutes, with water being
purified as it is driven by pressure through the membranes.
Electrodeionization (EDI) processes combine the use of ion-exchange
resins and membranes to deionize water. EDI equipment
is capable of efficient deionization of a wide range of feeds
from bulk salt removal to polishing of reverse osmosis product
water.Typically, in electrodeionization, a number of flat
sheets of alternating cation and anion exchange membranes are
placed between two electrodes with mixed bed of ion-exchange
resins alternately added between the membranes.The compartments containing the resin beads are
generally referred to as the dilute compartments. The adjacent
compartments into which ions are transferred for disposal are
referred to as the concentrate compartments. The concentrate
compartments usually are much thinner than the dilute
compartments, and serve to collect the concentrated ions being
transferred from the dilute compartments. The concentrate
compartment may or may not contain additional ion-exchange resin.When fluid flow is fed through the system, and 
electrical potential (voltage) is applied, ions
