<ABSTRACT>
A seat frame assembly for a motor vehicle comprises a 
seat frame (14) and a seat back frame (16). The seat frame 

is constructed and arranged to have a seat cushion (30) 
mounted thereon in overlying relation. The seat back frame 

(16) is connected with the seat frame (14) and has a pair 
of spaced metallic vertical support portions (34) at 

opposite sides thereof, the seat back frame being 
constructed and arranged to have a seat back cushion (32) 

mounted thereon. At least one of the vertical support 
portions is formed from a pair of telescoping tubular 

blanks including an elongated inner metal blank (300) 
formed into an integrally formed vertical member (36) of 

the at least one vertical portion extending from a lower 
portion of the seat back frame connected with the seat 

frame to an upper end of the seat back frame and a 
relatively shorter outer metal blank (320) formed into a 

sleeve (46) rigidly secured in surrounding relation to the 
lower portion of the vertical support member (36). The 

outer blank and inner blank are formed into the sleeve and 
the vertical member respectively during a hydroforming 

process in which the inner blank is expanded so that an 
outer surface (324) thereof is moved into peripheral 

contact with an inner surface (322) of the outer blank, and 
the inner blank and the outer blank are expanded into 

peripheral contact with die surfaces (310) defining the 
exterior surfaces of the one vertical support por
tion (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to seat
frame assemblies for motor vehicles and a method for
forming the same.In a typical motor vehicle, the vehicle
seats are constructed with a metal seat frame
assembly, including a seat back frame and seat
frame, and a seat back cushion and seat cushion
mounted in overlying relation on the seat back frame
and seat frame, respectively. The seat back frame
has lower portions thereof operatively connected
with rearward portions of a metal seat frame. The
seat frame can be of several different
configurations, such as the cross-wire type in which
a plurality of parallel and/or diagonal metal cross
wires are interconnected between support brackets
formed into a substantially rectangular
configuration, and the pan type in which a shallow
rectangular pan is mounted on support brackets.
Seat back frames, on the other hand, typically
include a pair of spaced vertical support portions
defining opposite sides thereof and rigid horizontal
support members interconnected therebetween. The
seat back frames also may include the
parallel/diagonal cross wires.The connection between the seat back frame
and seat frame is usually formed with a reclining
mechanism that is capable of permitting the seat
back frame to be pivotally movable with respect to
the seat frame so as to enable a seat occupant to
adjust the angle at which the seat back cushion is
reclined with respect to the seat cushion for
maximized comfort. Because the reclining mechanism 
connects the rearward portion of the seat frame with
the lower portion of the vertical supports of the
seat back frame, it can be appreciated that the
lower portion of the spaced vertical supports are
particularly subjected to large amounts of
mechanical stresses, especially when the seat back
is reclined at large angles with respect to the
seat, and even more so when an individual occupies
the seat.While it is important to manufacture the
vehicle seat frame assembly with sufficient
strength, it is equally important that the frame
assembly not be made from excessive amounts of
metal, otherwise material costs and vehicle weight
will be unnecessarily high. Thus, for the most
part, the vertical support portions and cross
members of the seat back frame are hollow (tubular)
in form. To accommodate for the aforementioned
mechanical stresses, however, it has been known to
manufacture at least one of the spaced vertical
supports with a relatively large wall thickness,
cross sectional diameter and strength. It is
especially important for the lower portion
