<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection control system for an internal
combustion engine has at least one unit injector for

injecting fuel into each cylinder, and an actuator
provided for each of the at least one unit injector for

varying the stroke of a plunger of the each unit
injector. When a rise ratio of rotational speed of the

engine calculated exceeds a predetermined value, the
actuator is shifted to a predetermined position,

thereby preventing an abnormal rise in the rotational
speed of the engine. Similarly, when a no-load

condition of the engine is detected, the actuator is
shifted to a predetermined position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel injection
control system for internal combustion engines,
particularly diesel engines, and more particularly to a
fuel injection control system of this kind which is
provided with an actuator, such as a stepping motor,
which operates to vary the delivery stroke of a plunger
accommodated within each unit injector for pressure
delivery of fuel, thereby controlling the amount of
fuel injection.The unit injector has an injection pump and a
nozzle assembled in one body, and is capable of
directly injecting an amount of fuel discharged by a
plunger via the nozzle, and hence has recently come
into wide use in fuel injection control systems for
diesel engines. Metering means for unit injectors of
this type has already been proposed e.g. by Japanese
Provisional Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 59-126064,
which is comprised of a stepping motor provided for
each unit injector for varying the delivery stroke of a
plunger of the unit injector to control an amount of
fuel injection by the use of a stepping motor control
signal delivered from a controller to each stepping
motor.In some conventional fuel injection control
systems for diesel engines, a revolution limiter is 
used for control of the rotational speed of the engine,
in order to prevent an excessive rise in the rotational
speed of the engine.However, if such a revolution limiter is applied
to the above proposed fuel injection control system,
the revolution limiter cannot perform desired control
before the rotational speed of the engine reaches a
predetermined value. Consequently, the control of the
rotational speed of the engine by the revolution
limiter requires driving an actuator such as the
stepping motor at an excessively high response speed
after the rotational speed of the engine has reached
the predetermined value, making it difficult to
positively prevent an abnormal rise in the rotational
speed of the engine. Further, the revolution limiter
is incapable of preventing an abnormal rise in the
rotational speed of the engine under all possible
operating conditions of the engine.It is the object of the invention to provide a
fuel injection control system for an internal
combustion engine engine which is capable of preventing
an abnormal rise in the rotational speed of the engine
under all operating conditions of the engine, by
detecting a no-load condition of the engine.The term "no-load condition" used throughout the
present specification means an operating condition (no-torque
load condition) that load on the engine
