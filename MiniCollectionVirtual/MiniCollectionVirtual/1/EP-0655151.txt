<ABSTRACT>
A digital virtual earth (DVE) cancellation system which receives a phenomena input signal via multiple sensors (1, 2, 3) representing residual phenomena to be canceled, and has adaptive filters (12, 24, 25) for each of the multiple sensor/actuator pairs, (1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6) which generate the appropriate cancellation signal (19, 20, 21) for the associated actuator (4, 5, 6). The multiple interacting DVE (MIDVE) algorithm estimates the noise at each sensor (1, 2, 3) by subtracting out the combined effects of each actuator signal (19, 20, 21) from the residual signal (16, 17, 18) at that sensor (1, 2, 3). This estimated noise signal is used to control the adaptive filters (12, 24, 25) associated with the subject actuator (4, 5, 6). These filters (12, 24, 25) receive the estimated noise as input. They then produce the cancellation signals by filtering the estimated noise with the filter weights. These weights are adapted using the residual signal (16, 17, 18) and the estimated noise convolved with the system impulse responses.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present application relates to an active cancellation system
comprising multiple sensor means for detecting vibration phenomena,
each sensor means producing an appropriate residual
signal, a processor means, input circuitry means coupled to
the multiple sensor means and adapted to convert said residual
signals into a digital form adapted to be used by said
processor means, output circuitry means, adapted to convert
multiple digital output signals from said processor means into
analog form, multiple output actuators for producing counter
vibration phenomena, whereby said processor means is coupled
to said input and said output circuitry means to receive
the multiple residual input signals and produce the multiple
output signals based upon a combination of said residual signals,
whereupon said vibration phenomena are cancelled. Such
active cancellation system is adapted to cancel repetitive or
non-repetitive phenomena. It makes use of the extension of
the digital virtual earth technology to applications involving
multiple interacting sensors and actuators. The application further relates to a method to cancel noise
comprising the steps of detecting multiple residual noise
phenomena, converting said multiple residual noise phenomena
into digital form, feeding said digitized residual noise phenomena
into a processor, calculating multiple output signals
in said processor and outputting said multiple output signals
to generate counter vibration phenomena.In US 5 091 953 (Tretter) an active cancellation system is
disclosed comprising multiple actuator and sensor means connected
to a processor means. Said processor means includes a
microprocessor which is programmed to execute algorithms
based on variable input signals stemming from the sensor means.
At known fundamental frequencies phase an amplitude of a
cancelling signal are calculated for controlling the respective
actuators.The article "A Multiple Error LMS Algorithm and its Application
to the Active Control of Sound and Vibration", IEEE
Transactions on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, Volume
ASSP-35, No. 10, October 1987, page 1423 by Stephen J.
Elliott et al. discloses an active cancellation system comprising
multiple actuator and sensor means and a processor
means. Noise is cancelled by passing a single reference signal
derived from the noise source through FIR-filters (fast
impulse response filters) the taps of which are adjusted by a
modified version of the LMS algorithm. In U.S. Patent Number 5,105,377 by the same inventor
there is described
