 WATER-IN-OIL-COMPOSITION FOR WOOD STAINSFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to stains. In particular, the present invention relates to stains which comprise water-in-oil emulsions.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONWood can be enhanced by the use of stains. For instance, stains can be used to change the color of the wood or they can be used to embellish the wood's grain structure. A stain is defined as a transparent, semitransparent or opaque solution or suspension of coloring matter consisting of pigments or dyes which imparts color effects to a substrate.Stains utilizing pigment are usually mixed with a solvent and a binder. Pigments are solid, inert particles of mineral which deflect light thereby causing a change in color on a wood substrate. The particles are not soluble, but rather are suspended in their application medium.In contrast, dyes differ from pigments in that they are in solution rather than in suspension. Moreover, binders are rarely used for dyes. In addition to being listed as dyes or pigments, stains can also be classified into two other broad groups: (1) aqueous types of solutions or emulsions, which use water as the primary liquid or continuous phase and (2) non-aqueous solutions which use organic solvents as the primary or continuous phase.The non-aqueous stains usually contain an oil- soluble alkyd resin either alone or in combination with certain other film-forming agents such as drying oils. Non-aqueous stains can also comprise in addition to colorant, just drying oils and/or combinations of drying oils. However, the non-aqueous stains are 

generally made by blending alkyds and non-drying oils with colored pigments and extender pigments such as clays and silicates in an organic solvent. If dyes are utilized, the alkyd resins are not necessary. Although these non-aqueous coatings are characterized by good wetting penetration and adhesion to the wood substrate, the organic solvents may exhibit adverse effects upon the Earth's atmosphere. Moreover, the organic solvents provide handling problems because of their volatility. Because of these adverse effects, these non-aqueous coatings are less than desirable.To overcome some of the adverse effects caused by organic solvents, there have been many attempts to utilize aqueous stains. Generally, aqueous stains are characterized by the use of oil-in-water emulsions. Most aqueous stains utilizing pigments use acrylic resins as the binder, but can also use water reducible or dispersable linseed oil or alkyd resin. These binders which

A water-in-oil wood stain composition comprising: (a) an oil continuous phase comprising a solution of a binder, and at least one colorant in an organic liquid and (b) a discontinuous phase comprising an aqueous medium wherein said composition has a solids content less than 50 percent by weight of said composition and is effective in highlighting wood.
2. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said colorant is at least one pigment.
3. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said colorant is at least one dye.
4. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said colorant comprises at least one pigment and at least one dye.
5. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said composition further comprises an emulsifier.
6. The composition of Claim 1 further comprising a dryer.
7. The composition of Claim 1 further comprising thickener.
8. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said binder is selected from the group comprising a drying oil, an oil soluble resin, a water reducible resin and mixtures of two or more of the foregoing.
9. The composition of Claim 1 further comprising a filler. 


 10. The composition of Claim 1 wherein said solids content comprises from about 5 to about 45 weight percent of said composition.
11. A method of staining wood comprising the steps of: a. applying to a substrate a wood stain in an effective amount of a composition according to Claim 1 to highlight wood grain thereon; and b. allowing said composition to dry on said substrate.
