<ABSTRACT>
Electrical interconnection structures are described. The 
electrical interconnection structures are formed by electrically 

interconnecting in a stack a plurality of discrete 

substrates (22, 24). By using a plurality of discrete 
substrates, a multilayer dielectric/electrical conductor 

structure can be fabricated from individual discrete 
substrates each of which can be tested prior to forming a 

composite stack so that defects in each discrete substrate 
can be eliminated before inclusion into the stack. Electrical 

interconnection between adjacent substrate is provided 
by an array of contact locations on each surface of 

the adjacent substrates. Corresponding contacts on adjacent 
substrates are adapted for mutual electrical engagement. 

Adjacent contact locations can be thermocompression 
bonded. To reduce the parasitic capacitance and coupled 

noise between the contact pads (26) the electrical conductors 
within the interior of each discrete substrate, the 

contact pads on each substrate have elongated shape. The 
elongated contact pads or lattice pads on adjacent 

substrates are nonparallel and preferably orthogonal so 
that the corresponding pads of adjacent substrates electrically 

interconnect an intersecting area which varies in 
location along the elongated contact pads as the placement 

of the adjacent substrates varies in the manufacture 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to electronic structures 
having electrically interconnected contact locations providing 
reduced capacitive loading between the contact 
locations and electrical conductors within the electronic 
structure. The computer electronics industry uses electronic packaging 
substrates on which electrical devices, such as semiconductor 
chips, are electrically mounted. The trend in the 
electronics industry is to use multilevel thin film structures 
on the electronic devices and substrates for providing 
electrical interconnection to the circuits on the 
chips and the substrates. State of the art multilevel thin 
film structures are preferably formed from thin layers of 
polymeric material with electrical conductors disposed 
therebetween and electrical conducting vias disposed 
through the thin film polymeric layers to provide electrical 
interconnection of the conductors on different 
levels of the multilevel structure. In order to reduce fabrication time and hence the cost of 
these thin film structures a parallel fabrication process 
rather than a sequential process is preferred In a sequential process, an electronic substrate, such as, 
a semiconductor chip or packaging substrate is provided. A 
polymer layer is disposed on a surface of the substrate. 
On the exposed surface of the polymer layer a patterned 
layer of electrical conductors is disposed. Another layer 
of polymeric material is disposed on the electrically conducting 
layer. Electrically conducting vias are formed 
through the second polymeric layer. A second layer of patterned 
electrical conductors are disposed on the exposed  
 
surface of the second polymeric layer. This process is 
continued until the desired number of layers of electrical 
conductors with polymeric layers disposed therebetween 
having electrically conducting vias to electrically interconnect 
adjacent electrically conducting layers is formed. 
In this sequential process, any one of the polymeric layers 
or the electrically conducting layers or the electrically 
conducting vias can have a defect which renders the the 
finally formed structure is unusable. It is preferable to build the multilayer structure in a 
parallel process wherein a group of planar subassemblies 
are fabricated and tested and then electrically assembled 
to form the multilevel thin film structure. The subassemblies 
have on both surfaces thereof an array of contact 
pads which are typically circular or square. A first 
substrate is disposed in contact with a second
