<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for tightening threaded joints to a 
desired pretension level using a manually operated power 

nutrunner and controlling the tightening process by 
determining during the tensioning phase the instantaneous 

growth per time unit of the torque resistance from the 
joint, and adapting continuously the rotation speed of 

the nutrunner in relation to the determined instantaneous 
torque growth per time unit so as to obtain the same 

reaction force characteristics in the nutrunner handle 
for all joints, regardless of differences in torque 

resistance growth per angle of rotation between the 
joints.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and a device for
tightening threaded joints, considering in particular the
ergonomic aspects or reaction force characteristics at
manually operated power nutrunners.In particular, the invention relates to a method for
tightening threaded joints to a desired pretension level
by means of a manually operated power nutrunner with a
handle, comprising the measures of rotating the joint
through a running down phase and a tensioning phase,
sensing during rotation of the joint the momentary torque
resistance in the joint, and terminating the rotation at
the attainment of said desired pretension level.Working with a power nutrunner, for instance of the
angled type, tend to be rather tiresome for the operator
due mainly to the fact that he or she is exposed to the
reaction force imparted in the tool housing and handle
during each tightening cycle.In previous studies it has been established that the
discomfort to the operator, i.e. the effort needed to
counteract the reaction force, depends on the operator's
actual working posture, as well as on the character of
the reaction force to be handled. Important factors are:
magnitude, duration and speed of force build-up and force
decrease.In these studies it has also been shown that the
nutrunner together with the arms of the operator respond 
to the reaction force impulse like a damped mass-spring
system with a certain resonance frequency. Accordingly,
the duration of the reaction force impulse in relation to
the resonance frequency is determining for the resultant
amplitude in the nutrunner handle and the discomfort to
the operator.The resonance frequency or system period of the
nutrunner-operator arm system depends both on the 
operator's physical properties and his actual working
posture. In other words, the system period is dependent
on the ability of the operator to withstand the reaction
force impulse.For a particular person and a certain working posture,
the resulting amplitude, which is a measure of the
operator's discomfort, depends on the duration of the
reaction force impulse. To show by means of an
experiment, a half-sine excitation force of different
duration has been exerted on a typical nutrunner-operator
reaction absorbing system.The method and the device according to the invention make
it possible to
1/ adapt the reaction force impulse to what suits an
average operator best for a particular tightening
operation, taking into consideration torque applied,
joint rate (stiffness), working posture (upright, bending
over,
