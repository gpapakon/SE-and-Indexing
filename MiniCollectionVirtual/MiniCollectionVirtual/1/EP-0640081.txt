This invention relates to substituted phenylcarbamates and ureas,
to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing
them and to their medical use.European Patent Specification No. EP 0419397 describes compounds of
formula

wherein
R10 is a group

where S is 2 or 3, t is 1 or 2, u is 1 to 3, v is 1-3 andR40 and R50 are H, C1-7alkyl or C3-6cycloalkyl; and wherein R20 is an
oxadiazole, substituted with C1-8alkyl, C2-8alkenyl, C2-8alkynyl, C3-7cycloalkyl,
benzyl, phenyl, C1-6alkoxy, C1-6alkylthio, amino or alkylamino; orwherein R20 is -C-R60 = N-O-R70, wherein R60 is hydrogen or methyl andR70 is C1-6alkyl which may be substituted with C3-7 cycloalkyl;and wherein R30 is hydrogen, halogen, nitro, substituted amine, trifluoromethyl,
C1-6alkyl or C1-6alkoxy.These compounds are stated to have 5-HT3-receptor antagonist activity, antiemetic
activity and/or gastric motility enhancing activity. European Patent Specification No. EP 323077 comprises inter alia azabicyclic
substituted phenylcarbamates and phenylureas which also act as 5-HT
antagonists.European Patent Specification No. EP 007184 describes anti-arrhythmic
alkylaminopropyl substituted phenylurea derivatives. Chemical abstracts (1980)
93, 106809f discloses inter alia anti-hypertensive (substituted) piperidine
substituted phenylurea derivatives. Chemical abstracts (1969) 70, 11519x
comprises piperidine(pyrrolidinyl)methyl substituted phenylcarbamate derivatives
which act as local anaesthetics.European Patent Specification No. EP 0526313 discloses N-4-piperidine-ethyl
substituted phenylurea derivatives which lack the instant oxadiazolyl or
thiadiazolyl substitution and which are useful as inhibitors of
acetylcholinesterase.European Patent Specification No. EP 0516520 describes N-aminoalkyl
substituted phenylurea derivatives which lack the present piperidine and
oxadiazolyl- or thiadiazolyl substitution and which are useful as inhibitors of
acetylcholinesterase.WO-A-9312785 and WO-A-9314745 provide information with regard to 5-HT
receptors in general and the interrelationship of 5-HT3 receptors and 5-HT4
receptors in particular. Thus, the present invention provides substituted phenylcarbamates and ureas of
formula (I):

wherein R1 represents a hydrogen or a halogen atom, or a C1-6alkyl or C1-6alkoxy
