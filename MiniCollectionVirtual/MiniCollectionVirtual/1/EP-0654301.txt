<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the preparation of palladiuim and 

palladium/gold shell type catalysts for vinyl acetate production, 
the improvement comprises using a barium salt to precipitate 

water-insoluble palladium and optional gold compounds onto a 
support prior to reduction with a reducing agent. A barium salt 

additive may also be introduced to the catalyst after reduction to 
reduce the tendency of the catalyst to deactivate with use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of 
catalysts and in particular to the preparation of palladium and 
palladium/gold catalysts useful in effecting the production of 
vinyl acetate from ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen containing 
gas. The production of vinyl acetate by reacting ethylene, acetic 
acid and oxygen together in the gas-phase in the presence of a 
catalyst containing palladium, gold and an alkali metal acetate 
promoter is a known process. The catalyst components are 
typically supported on a porous carrier material such as silica or 
alumina. In early examples of these catalysts, both the palladium and 
gold were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the 
carrier (see for example US 3,743,607 and GB 1,333,449). This was 
subsequently recognised to be a disadvantage because it was found 
that the material within the inner part of the carrier did not 
contribute to the reaction since the reactants did not diffuse 
significantly into the carrier before reaction occurred. In other 
words a significant amount of the palladium and gold never came 
into contact with the reactants. In order to overcome this problem, new methods of catalyst 
manufacture were devised with the aim of producing catalysts in 
which the most active components were concentrated in the 
outermost shell of the support (shell impregnated catalysts). For 
example GB 1,500,167 claims catalysts in which at least 90% of the  
 
palladium and gold is distributed in that part of the carrier 
particle which is not more than 30% of the particle radius from 
the surface, whilst GB 1,283,737 teaches that the degree of 
penetration into the porous carrier can be controlled by 
pretreating the porous carrier with an alkaline solution of, for 
example, sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide. Another approach which has been found to produce 
particularly active catalysts is described in US 4,048,096. In 
this patent, shell impregnated catalysts are produced by a process 
comprising the Steps of (1) impregnating a catalyst support with 
an aqueous solution of water-soluble palladium and gold compounds, 
the total volume of the solutions being 95 to 100% of the 
absorptive capacity; (2) precipitating water-insoluble palladium 
and gold compounds on the catalyst support by contacting the 
impregnated catalyst support with a solution of alkali metal 
silicate, the amount of alkali metal silicate being such that, 
after the alkali metal silicate has been in contact with the 
carrier for 12 to 24 hours, the pH of the
