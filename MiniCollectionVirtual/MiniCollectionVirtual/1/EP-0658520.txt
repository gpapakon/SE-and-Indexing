A method of building up an optical fiber preform by using plasma
deposition, the method consisting in depositing build-up silica on the primary

preform (P) to be built up by means of a plasma torch (5), the method being
characterized in that it further consists in injecting hydroxyl ions in controlled

manner into said build-up silica so as to obtain an average hydroxyl ion
concentration lying in the range 50 ppm to 100 ppm in the build-up silica

deposited on said primary preform.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists in injecting
said hydroxyl ions into said build-up silica substantially at the flame of the

plasma torch (5) as said primary preform (P) is being built up.
A method according to claim 3, characterized in that it consists in using a
plasma-generating gas containing the elements required for injecting a

controlled quantity of said hydroxyl ions into said build-up silica.
A method according to claim 3, characterized in that the plasma-generating
gas used is humidified upstream from said plasma torch (5).
A method according to claim 2, characterized in that said hydroxyl ions are
injected into the build-up silica immediately downstream from said plasma

torch (5).
A method according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterized in that it
consists in using silica grains for constituting the build-up silica.
A method according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterized in that it
consists in using a silica compound having substantially no hydroxyl ions as

the raw material for obtaining said build-up silica that is deposited on the
primary preform (P).
A method according to claim 6, characterized in that it consists in injecting
said hydroxyl ions into said build-up silica by prior and controlled delivery of

said hydroxyl ions into the silica grains used for said build-up silica. 
A method according to claim 6, characterized in that it consists in injecting
said hydroxyl ions into said build-up silica firstly prior to building up by feeding

a fraction of said hydroxyl ions to said silica grains used for the build-up silica,
and secondly by adding further ions while building up is taking place.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that it consists in injecting
said hydroxyl ions into the build-up silica which is deposited in the form of soot

on said primary preform (P) and then consolidated thereon, injection taking
place during consolidation which is then performed in an atmosphere that

includes atoms of hydrogen and of oxygen.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that
said hydroxyl ions are in a substantially constant quantity in said build-up

silica.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that
said hydroxyl ions are in a quantity that varies through the thickness of the

build-up silica.
An optical fiber made from a primary preform (P) built up with silica by the
method according to any one of claims 1 to 10, the fiber comprising an optical

core (1), optical cladding (2), and at least one silica covering, with the outer
silica covering (3, 4) being the result of said primary preform being built up,

the fiber being characterized in that said outer silica covering has an average
hydroxyl ion concentration lying in the range 50 ppm to 150 ppm.
An optical fiber according to claim 13, characterized in that said outer
silica covering (3, 4) has a hydroxyl ion concentration that varies

progressively, the covering comprising an innermost first layer (3) having a
hydroxyl ion concentration that is less than 50 ppm, and a second layer (4)

covering said first layer having a thickness that is greater than the thickness
of said first layer, and having a hydroxyl ion concentration lying in the range

50 ppm to 250 ppm.
An optical fiber according to claim 14, characterized in that said outer
silica covering (3, 4) includes a third, outermost layer having a hydroxyl ion

concentration of less than 50 ppm.
