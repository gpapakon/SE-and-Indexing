<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus 
for the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foams by 
the essentially free rise, continuous casting method 
in which carbon dioxide from sources other than the 
reaction of water and free isocyanate is present in 
the gaseous state during the foam-forming reaction 
and contributes to the rise of the foam and lowering 
of the density of the foam product. Polyurethane foams in general, and flexible 
foams specifically, use the reaction of isocyanates 
containing two or more isocyanate (NCO) groups with 
water to generate carbon dioxide gas. This gas is 
dispersed and retained to a large extent during the 
polymerization reaction and thus leads to the 
formation of foams. The polymerization reaction 
involves the reaction of additional isocyanate with a 
polymer that contains NCO reactive groups which are  
 
usually OH, but can also include NH₂, SH, COOH and 
others. At the time the reaction is essentially complete 
the foam gels, i.e., becomes solid, and the cells are 
usually broken open by the heat of reaction and 
pressure of the trapped gases to produce the well 
known open cell structure of such flexible foams. The many considerations relating to the 
selection of raw materials, catalysts, emulsifiers 
additives and mechanical conditions to produce a 
large variety of flexible foams exhibiting different 
physical properties are well established and known in 
the art. The most critical of these properties is the 
control of density and firmness of foams for various 
end uses. The density of the finished foam is controlled 
to a large extent by controlling the amount of gas 
generation, or "blowing" by CO₂ by adjusting the 
amount of water used in the formulation. However, 
it is well known that the reaction which generates 
CO₂ also produces urea linkages in the polymer which 
have the effect of making the foam firmer and more 
brittle. Therefore the density cannot be varied 
independently of the effect on other properties simply 
by addition of more water and isocyanate. Furthermore 
the reaction of water with isocyanates is highly 
exothermic and the heat generated can cause 
undesirable effects ranging from internal degradation, 
e.g., scorch, to decomposition and even combustion of 
the foam during the curing phase of the reaction. To counteract some of these negative aspects so 
called "auxiliary blowing agents" have been used to 
produce foams of relatively low density. These are 
low boiling liquids which are converted to gases by  
 
the heat
