<ABSTRACT>
A gas scrubber is disclosed comprising a gas duct (6) 
and a static sprayer (8) therein, the static sprayer being 

adapted to develop a sheet of washing fluid across the 
duct. The sheet may be substantially planar, and the 

sprayer may comprise a nozzle (100) having an outlet (110) 
equipped with a deflector (120) (e.g. a conical, frusto-conical, 

cusped or trumpet-shaped deflector). The 
deflector (120) is arranged to be moveable relative to the 

outlet (110) during use of the gas scrubber so it can be 
cleared of solid occlusions without halting the gas 

scrubbing process. The gas scrubber is useful in methods 
of scrubbing gas for use in air pollution control and air-conditioning 

systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wet scrubbers for use in 
removing contaminants from gases, and in particular for 
removing particulates from air in air pollution control 
systems. For both commercial and environmental reasons the 
removal of impurities from gases is an important problem. 
In particular, it is now extremely important to reduce the 
level of impurities in gaseous emmissions prior to release 
into the atmosphere, and the health benefits of purifying 
air for use in air conditioning systems are well 
established. These problems have been addressed via the use of wet 
scrubbing systems, in which finely divided droplets of a 
washing liquid are sprayed into a stream of gas. In these 
systems, impurities in the gas are absorbed by the droplets 
of washing liquid and thereby removed from the gaseous 
phase. Such systems conventionally use nozzles to disperse 
the washing liquid. It is desirable, in the interests of economy, to 
recirculate the washing fluid but this could only be done 
in prior art systems by employing efficient filters in the  
 
fluid recirculation system to prevent blockages in the 
nozzles by material removed from the cleaned gasses. Any 
such filters would have to be cleaned regularly to maintain 
a ready circulation of the washing fluid. A gas scrubber according to the present invention 
comprises a gas duct and a static sprayer therein arranged 
to spray recirculated washing fluid across the duct, the 
sprayer comprising a nozzle having an outlet for the 
washing liquid at which is provided a deflector, the 
deflector being arranged to be moveable relative to the 
outlet during use of the gas scrubber for cleaning the 
sprayer of solid occlusions. The present invention allows the sprayer to be cleared 
of any accumulated occlusion without stopping the scrubbing 
process. Because the sprayer nozzle itself can be cleaned, 
the requirement for a comprehensive filter system in the 
recirculation path is obviated although clearly some such 
filtering may also be carried out with the present 
invention if desired and convenient. Rotating nozzles have moving parts that are prone to 
rapid wear and consequential increases in maintenance 
costs. Moreover, the need for drive means to rotate such 
nozzles adds to the capital and running costs of the  
 
scrubbing system. Preferably, then, the gas scrubber 
includes a static sprayer therein, the static sprayer being 
preferably adapted to develop a sheet of washing fluid 
across the duct. Other spray patterns may, however, be 
used, for

A gas scrubber comprising a gas duct (6) and a 
static sprayer (8) therein arranged to spray recirculated 

washing fluid across the duct, the sprayer comprising a 
nozzle (100) having an outlet (110) for the washing liquid 

at which is provided a deflector (120), the deflector (120) 
being arranged to be moveable relative to the outlet (140) 

during use of the gas scrubber for cleaning the sprayer of 
solid occlusions. 
A gas scrubber according to claim 1 wherein the 
sheet of washing fluid produced by the static sprayer in 

use is substantially planar. 
A gas scrubber according to either one of claims 
1 and 2 wherein the deflector (120) is conical, frusto-conical, 

cusped or trumpet-shaped. 
A gas scrubber according to claim 3 wherein the 

outer perimeter of the deflector (120) has an annular 
groove (200) bounded by a lip (210) immediately adjacent 

the outer periphery thereof. 
A gas scrubber according to any one of claims 1 
to 4 wherein the deflector (120) is mounted on a stem 

 
(130), the longitudinal axis of the stem being co-axial 

with that of the outlet (110). 
A gas scrubber according to any one of the 
preceding claims comprising a plurality of static sprayers 

(8). 
A gas scrubber according to claim 6, wherein the 
static sprayers (8) are arranged in one plane or adjacent 

a common plane. 
A gas scrubber according to any one of the 
preceding claims wherein the washing fluid is fed to the 

nozzle and recirculated via a tank (14). 
A static sprayer comprising a nozzle (100) having 
an outlet (110) and a deflector (120), and adjustment means 

(342) for adjusting the distance between the outlet (110) 
and the deflector (120) coupleable to the recirculating 

washing fluid and powerable hydraulically thereby. 
A sprayer as claimed in claim 9 in which the 
adjustment means comprises a double-acting piston/cylinder 

actuator (342). 
A sprayer as claimed in claim 10 in which the 
 

adjustment means (342) includes control ports (346, 348) 
connected to a changeover valve (V) which is further 

connected to a pressuring line (352) and to a 
depressurising line (354). 
A sprayer as claimed in claim 11 in which the 
valve (V) is motor driven.
