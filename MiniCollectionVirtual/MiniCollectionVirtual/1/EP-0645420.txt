<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polymethacrylate casting resins, to the curing thereof and to mouldings produced therefrom. The novel polymethacrylate casting resins have a microdomain structure which ensures a high degree of reflection and a low degree of transmission in mouldings produced therefrom. The microdomain structure, which provides microdomains having a diameter of 10 nm to 2  mu m, is achieved by polymerisation of the monomer constituents of the casting resin in the presence of from 5 to 15% by weight, based on the casting resin formulation, of alkanes, preferably n-alkanes, having 5 to 12 carbon atoms.

<CLAIMS>
A casting resin formulation comprising methacrylate
monomers which has a micropore structure in its

hardened stare,

characterised in that alkanes with 5 to 12 carbon
atoms are used in a proportion of 5 to 15 percent

by weight, based on the casting resin formulation,
to form the micropores and that the micropore

structure in the hardened casting resin comprises
micropores which have a diameter of between 10 nm

and 2 Âµm.
A casting resin formulation according to claim 1,
characterised in that in addition to the

methacrylate monomers, the casting resin
formulation also contains from 0.1 to 20 percent by

weight of polymethacrylate prepolymerisate PP.
A casting resin formulation according to claims 1
and 2, characterised in that 0.05 to 1.5 percent by

weight, based on the casting resin formulation, of
a radically-polymerisable carboxylic acid are

present in addition to the methacrylate monomers.
A casting resin formulation according to claims 1
to 3, characterised in that 0.01 to 1 percent by

weight, based on the casting resin formulation, of
a dehydrating agent DM are present.
A casting resin formulation according to claims 1
to 4, characterised in that in addition to the

other monomers, 0.01 to 1 percent by weight, based
on the casting resin formulation, of a monomeric

crosslinker VM are present. 
A casting resin formulation according to claims 1
to 5, characterised in that 10
-3
 to 1 percent by
weight, based on the casting resin formulation, of

a mould release agent TM are present.
A casting resin formulation according to claims 1
to 6, characterised in that 0.01 to 10 percent by

weight, based on the casting resin formulation, of
soluble colour pigments are present.
A casting resin formulation according to claims 1
to 7, characterised in that the light-scattering

intensity of moulded parts made from the hardened
resin can be controlled by alteration of the

moulding part temperature.
A casting resin formulation according to claims 1

which can be uniformly illuminated by a light
source disposed on one edge of the illuminating

body.
