<ABSTRACT>
The planar porous composite structure comprises a reinforcing structure and a matrix. The structure is formed by regular planar structures with openings, formed of continuous yarns (3, 3a, 3b), such as of knitted, woven or braided layers (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d). The pores are formed by the openings (2) of the said structures, such as by the loops of the knitted fabric or by the openings between the weft and warp yarns of a woven fabric, which are aligned by means of aligning means (7) with each other relative to the direction of the plane of the layer. The reinforcing structure is formed by the reinforcing fibres contained in the yarn (3) serving as the structural part of the structure with openings, and the matrix by the matrix material comprised in the yarn (3) of the same structure, the said matrix binding the different yarn sections of the layer (1) that surround single openings and the different layers together, stiffening simultaneously the structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a planar porous composite structure according to the
precharacterizng part of Claim 1. The invention relates also to methods for
manufacturing a structure of this kind.A composite consists of matrix plastics and reinforcing structure.The reinforcing structures can be based either on continuous or staple fibres. The
continuous fibres such as high-module filaments of glass, aramid or carbon form a
uniform, usual uniaxial network. The excellent mechanical properties of the structural
composites are due to the continuous fibres, or
filaments, which are usually 50 times stronger and
20 to 150 times more rigid than the matrix materials.
Fibres with low density (1.44-2.7 g/cm3) have high
tensile strength and elastic modulus (3.0-4.5 GPa and
80-550 GPa, respectively), whereas the corresponding
typical values for matrix polymers are 30-130 MPa and
2.0-4.0 GPa, respectively.The properties of the composite are anisotropic,
which is clearest in uniaxial structures. They give
maximum tensile strength and modulus. As pieces are
usually loaded by a three-dimensional stress field,
the one-dimensional plates must be laminated on top
of each other in order to achieve reinforcement in
several directions. When the continuous fibres are
oriented multiaxially in a plane, pseudoisotropic
laminates are obtained. In three-dimensional basic
coordinates, their stiffness in the xy-plane is
comparable to that of aluminum mixtures, but the
transverse tensile strength and elastic modulus as
well as the shearing strength are low. This is due to 
the differences in the elastic coefficients between
different layers, and therefore the load of the matrix
varies in the direction of the thickness of the
laminate (z). Thus the breaking of the structural
composite is in most cases due to the gliding of
layers in relation to each other.For orientation of the continuous fibres in the
structure in a desired way, thermosetting plastic
matrices with low viscosity, such as epoxies and
polyesters, and expensive manual methods, such as
manual lamination and autoclaves, have generally been
used in the production of complex composite pieces.
The manufacture of thermosetting plastic composites
has been slow and difficult, because special equipment
is required for the storage and handling of a fluid
matrix and the chemical cross-linking of the composites
takes a long time. Other difficulties, and in some
cases even barriers, for the future development of
thermosetting plastic composites are caused by their
brittleness and
