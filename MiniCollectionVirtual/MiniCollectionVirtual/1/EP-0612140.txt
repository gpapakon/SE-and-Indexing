<ABSTRACT>
Voltage drops in a charge pump circuit may be substantially 
eliminated by functionally replacing the charge transfer diodes with 

analog switches (M5,M6). The power stage that drives a charge transfer 
capacitor (C1) may draw the heavy current peaks needed to drive the 

capacitor directly from the supply line (Vcc) thus preventing voltage 
drops across a voltage regulator and utilizes a bootstrap capacitor (Cb) 

for maintaining a conductive state during an entire half cycle of 
oscillation. The analog switches (M5,M6) may be driven in phase 

opposition by a CMOS inverter (M7,M8) or by two distinct comparators 
(A1,A2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an integrated charge pump circuit 
for implementing a voltage multiplier in integrated 
circuits operating with a relatively low supply 
voltage. The circuit is particularly suited for driving 
a high-side driver power device of a half-bridge output 
stage employing integrated DMOS transistors. Integration in the same chip of complex systems 
often composed of distinct circuit sections that are 
necessarily realized with structuraly and functionally 
different devices, erasing and programming of read only 
memory cells, optimization of the driving conditions of 
integrated power devices in a half-bridge configuration, 
require or benefit from the availability of a 
biasing or driving voltage higher than the supply voltage 
of the integrated circuit. Often these requirements 
are satisfied by integrating special voltage multiplying 
circuits capable of producing, on an output 
ballast capacitance (storage capacitance) a voltage 
that is higher than the supply voltage (VCC). These circuits 
are commonly referred to as voltage multipliers 
or charge pump circuits. A basic diagram of a charge pump circuit is 
depicted in Fig. 1. Basically, the capacitor C2 stores electric 
charge that is fed thereto by transferring (pumping) 
the charge momentarily stored in a transfer capacitance 
C1 through a transfer diode D2. The intermittent 
charging of C1 through a diode D1 connected to VCC, and 
the discharging of the electric charge stored therein  
 
into the output capacitance C2, are controlled by a 
free-running local oscillator (OSC LOC). At steady 
state, the circuit operates as follows. During an initial half cycle, the output of the 
local oscillator OSC LOC is low and the capacitance 
C1 charges through the diode D1 to a voltage given by: 
VCC-Vd, where Vd represents the voltage drop across the 
charge diode D1. In the following half cycle, the 
output of the oscillator goes to a voltage VR, the node 
A assumes the voltage given by: VCC+VR-Vd, and the 
capacitance C1, discharges the electric charge that was 
stored therein during the preceding half cycle in the 
output storage capacitance C2. The capacitance C2, 
assumes the voltage VCP given by the following 
relation: 
VCP=VCC+VR-2·Vd It may be observed that for: VR=VCC, the circuit 
becomes substantially a voltage duplicator and provides 
an output voltage equal to twice the supply voltage 
less the voltage drop across the diodes. Of course, the circuit may be composed of an 
N-number of such a basic circuit module, in
