<ABSTRACT>
A coin stacking means for stacking coins to be wrapped 
includes a pair of stacking block means (8a,8b) each being movable 

relative to the other perpendicular to the direction in 
which a coin sorting passage (4) for passing coins of a predetermined 

denomination therethrough extends. The first stacking 
block means includes a first inner wall section lying at 

an angle X to the direction in which the coin sorting passage 
extends and a second inner wall section lying at an 

angle -X to the direction in which the coin sorting passage 
extends. The second inner wall section is higher than the 

first inner wall section in the direction in which the coins 
are stacked. The second stacking block means includes a 

first inner wall section and a second inner wall section. 
The first inner wall section thereof and the first inner 

wall section of said first stacking block are formed symmetrically 
with respect to the center line of said coin sorting 

passage, and the second inner wall section thereof and said 
second inner wall section of said first stacking block are 

formed symmetrically with respect to the center line of said 
coin sorting passage. The second inner wall section thereof 

is higher than said first inner wall section thereof in the 
di
rection in which the coins are stacked.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin wrapping
machine and, in particular, to a coin wrapping machine
comprising a rotatable disk for receiving deposited coins
and feeding out the received coins to a coin sorting passage
by the centrifugal force produced by rotation thereof, the
coin sorting passage for passing coins of a predetermined
denomination therethrough, coin stacking means for stacking
coins to be wrapped, coin support post means for receiving
coins stacked in the coin stacking means at a post waiting
position immediately below the coin stacking means and
supporting them on the upper surface thereof, coin wrapping
means including a plurality of wrapping rollers for winding
a wrapping film around the stacked coins supported by the
coin support post means to wrap them and produce a wrapped
coin roll, support post moving means for moving the coin
support post means between the post waiting position immediately
below the coin stacking means, a post wrapping position
where the coins supported on the upper surface of the
coin support post means can be wrapped by the coin wrapping
means and a post retracted position where the coin support
post means is retracted from between the plurality of wrapping
rollers, and wrapping roller moving means for moving
the plurality of wrapping rollers between wrapping roller
wrapping positions where the coins are wrapped and wrapping
roller retracted positions.A coin wrapping machine is generally constituted so as
to feed deposited coins to be wrapped from a coin passage to
a coin stacking means having a pair of stacking drums, to
stack a predetermined number of the coins by the rotation of
the pair of stacking drums while the coins are supported by
the upper surfaces of helical coin guides formed on the
surface of the pair of stacking drums, to transport the
stacked coins onto the upper surface of a coin support post
which is on standby at a predetermined position, and to
lower the coin support post into a coin wrapping means
located below the coin stacking means and having a plurality
of wrapping rollers, whereafter the wrapping rollers wind a
wrapping film around the stacked coins supported by the
upper surface of the coin support post so as to wrap the
predetermined number of coins.In this type of coin wrapping machine, as disclosed
for example in Japanese Patent Application laid open No. 62-208329,
in order to wrap coins of different denominations
having various diameters, the pair of stacking drums can be
moved relative to each other in accordance with the

<CLAIMS>
A coin wrapping machine comprising a rotatable disk (1) for receiving
desposited coins and feeding out the received coins to a coin sorting passage

(4) by a centrifugal force produced by rotation thereof, the coin sorting passage
(4) for passing coins of a predetermined denomination therethrough, coin

stacking means for stacking coins to be wrapped, coin support post means (70)
for receiving coins stacked in the coin stacking means (7) at a post waiting position

immediately below the coin stacking means (7) and supporting them on
the upper surface thereof, coin wrapping means including a plurality of wrapping

rollers (86a, 86b, 86c) for winding a wrapping film around the stacked
coins supported by the coin support post means (70) to wrap them and produce

a wrapped coin roll, support post moving means (71-81) for moving the coin
support post means (70) between the post waiting position immediately below

the coin stacking means (7), a post wrapping position where the coins supported
on the upper surface of the coin support post means (70) can be

wrapped by the coin wrapping means and a post retracted position where the
