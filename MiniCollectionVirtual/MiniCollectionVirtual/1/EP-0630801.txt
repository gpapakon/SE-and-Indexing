<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle bonnet assembly has a bonnet (11) hinged to the 
vehicle body (13) by means of a hinge assembly (14) 

including a first link (20) pivoted intermediate of its 
extremities to the vehicle body (13) and second and third 

links (25, 30) pivoted at one end, each to a different 
end of the first link (20), and at their other ends to 

the bonnet (11), the links (20, 25, 30) being arranged 
such that when the bonnet (11) is closed, the bonnet (11) 

will move rearwardly upon an impact above a predetermined 
magnitude being applied to the leading edge (12) of the 

bonnet (11), the links (20, 25, 30) pivoting to lift the 
trailing edge (15) of the bonnet (11), the bonnet (11) 

pivoting between an open and closed position about the 
pivotal connection of the first link (20) to the vehicle 

body (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicle bonnets and in 
particular to bonnets for motor cars. In modern motor car design, for visibility, aerodynamic 
and styling reasons, it is desirable that the bonnet line 
is kept as low as possible. As a result, there is 
generally very little clearance between the bonnet and 
the engine bay contents of the motor vehicle. 
Consequently the bonnet will provide very little 
cushioning effect when impacted by a pedestrian during an 
accident. EP-A-0,509,690 discloses a vehicle bonnet which is hinged 
at its leading edge. The hinge mechanism by which the 
bonnet is attached to the vehicle, is arranged to cause 
the trailing edge of the bonnet to lift when the forward 
edge of the bonnet is impacted by a pedestrian during an 
accident. With the hinge mechanism disclosed in the 
above patent specification, the leading edge of the 
bonnet moves downwardly, requiring a clearance beneath 
the bonnet forward of the hinge assembly. This 
requirement will impose restrictions on the height of the 
bonnet at its leading edge and/or the positioning of 
components, for example the radiator beneath the bonnet 
adjacent its leading edge. The present invention provides a hinge mechanism for a 
forwardly hinged bonnet, which will enable the trailing 
edge of the bonnet to be raised whilst minimising the 
lowering of the leading edge. In accordance with the present invention a vehicle bonnet 
assembly includes a bonnet, said bonnet being hinged to 
the vehicle body adjacent a first edge transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the vehicle and having releasable  
 
latch means adjacent a second edge transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the vehicle, the bonnet being hinged 
to the vehicle body by means of a hinge assembly, which 
is arranged such that when the bonnet is closed, upon 
rearward movement of the bonnet in response to an impact 
above a predetermined magnitude being applied to the 
leading edge of the bonnet, the bonnet is lifted, the 
bonnet being pivoted between an open and a closed 
position about the pivotal connection of the hinge 
assembly to the vehicle body or bonnet, characterised in 
that the hinge assembly comprises a first link pivoted 
intermediate of its extremities to either the vehicle 
body or bonnet and second and third links pivoted at one 
end, each to a different end of the first link, and at 
their other ends to the other of said bonnet or vehicle 
body, the links being arranged such that upon said 
rearward movement of the bonnet, the bonnet 11 is

A vehicle bonnet assembly including a bonnet (11), 
said bonnet (11) being hinged to the vehicle body 

adjacent a first edge (12) transverse to the longitudinal 
axis of the vehicle and having releasable latch means 

(16) adjacent a second edge (15) transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the vehicle, the bonnet (11) being 

hinged to the vehicle body (13) by means of a hinge 
assembly (14), which is arranged such that when the 

bonnet (11) is closed, upon rearward movement of the 
bonnet (11) in response to an impact above a 

predetermined magnitude being applied to the leading edge 
(12) of the bonnet (11), the bonnet (11) is lifted, the 

bonnet (11) being pivoted between an open and a closed 
position about the pivotal connection o
f the hinge 
assembly (14) to the vehicle body (13) or bonnet (11), 

characterised in that the hinge assembly (14) comprises a 
first link (20) pivoted intermediate of its extremities 

to either the vehicle body (13) or bonnet (11) and second 
and third links (25, 30) pivoted at one end, each to a 

different end of the first link (20), and at their other 
ends to the other of said bonnet (11) or vehicle body 

(13), the links (20, 25, 30) being arranged such that 
upon said rearward movement of the bonnet (11), the 

bonnet 11 is lifted by said links (20, 25, 30), said 
pivotal movement of the bonnet (11) between an open and a 

closed position being made about the pivotal connection 
of the first link (20) to the vehicle body (13) or bonnet 

(11). 
A vehicle bonnet assembly according to Claim 1 
characterised in that the bonnet (11) is hinged adjacent 

its leading edge (12) means (40; 46, 47; 50, 53) being 
provided adjacent the trailing edge (15) of the bonnet 

(11) to lift the trailing edge (15) of the bonnet (11) as
