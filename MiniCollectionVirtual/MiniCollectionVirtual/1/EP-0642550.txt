 Title: RADIO FREQUENCY WELDABLE POLYMER ARTICLESField of the Invention This invention relates to polymer articles containing ethylene vinyl acetate, articles made therefrom and compositions for making them. These articles may be joined by radio frequency welding.BackgroundThermoplastics have been widely used in the formation of medical parts for which excellent design, performance, and volume capabilities are required. For example, the use of plastics in the formation of packaging for physiologic solutions is well known in the medical field. They are usable whenever transparent and flexible packages, such as infusion-solution bags and blood bags, are needed.In order to be useful in medical applications, a thermoplastic must meet various criteria. The plastics intended for packaging physiologic solutions must be inexpensive and easy to manufacture, must not react with the components of physiologic solutions, and must not leach additives into physiologic solutions. Their permeability to water- vapor, air and other gases must be low, their resistance to heat, radiation and ethylene oxide must be high since they are subjected to sterilization. Medical plastics also must be sealable by well-established methods (e.g., by radio frequency ("RF"), ultrasonics or the like), and they must withstand mechanical stresses common to medical environments.One resin that has been used successfully in medical environments is poly(vinyl chloride) ("PVC"). The relevant art prior to and the subsequent development of this material as a medical plastic is reviewed in R.N. Burgess, ed.,Manufacture and Processing of PVC, Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York,1982.While PVC provides significant benefits, it is subject to certain drawbacks and disadvantages. Most notably, PVC requires a considerable proportion of plasticizers in order to make the material flexible and aid sealability. The tendency of the softeners and plasticizers to diffuse, leach or migrate from medical packaging made from such materials naturally limits their application.Another deficiency of PVC is its tendency, under cold conditions common to storin physiologic materials, to loose flexibility and impact resistance. This can 

result in an undesirably high proportion of package breakages during transit and distribution. Also, infusion-solution bags made from softened PNC are often susceptible to degradation by atmospheric oxygen and microorganisms which can lead to additional package breakages. Prior to the present invention, alternatives to PNC for medical
