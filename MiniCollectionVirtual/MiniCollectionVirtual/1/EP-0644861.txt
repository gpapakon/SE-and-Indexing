<ABSTRACT>
An insulating material based on used raw materials is disclosed, as well as a process for producing the same. Such insulating materials are useful as fillers, heat insulating, construction and/or insulating materials in construction and packaging, as parts shaped in insulating material, as in-situ molded cellular plastic and as packaging material. This insulating material is essentially composed of 50-70 % crushed wood and/or defibrated used paper and/or defibrated cardboard with 0-30 % textile, vegetable or inorganic fibres and 20-50 % alkali silicate, with respect to the total mass of the insulating material. The rest is composed if required of 0-30 % additives, with respect to the total mass of the insulating material.

<CLAIMS>
Insulating material based on waste material and fibrous raw materials, characterised by 
the fact that it is composed of 


50-70 % chipped wood or grasses or shredded waste paper and/or shredded board 
containing 0 - 30 % textile, plant or inorganic fibres or chipped wood and shredded 

waste paper and/or shredded board containing 0 - 30 % textile, plant or inorganic 
fibres whereby chipped wood or grasses are present as products impregnated with 

milk-of-lime and water glass solution and of 
20 - 50 % alkali silicate, in relation to the total mass of the insulating material, 
whereby the remainder consists of 
0 - 30 % auxiliary agents, in relation to the total mass of the insulating material, and 
the insulating materials is expanded. 
Insulating material as claimed in Claim 1 characterised by the fact that chipped wood 
waste or sawings or chipped windfall or chipped industrial timber waste or shredded 

bamboo or straw or mixtures of the aforementioned materials are used as chipped 
wood. 
Insulating material as claimed in Claim 1 characterised by the fact that calcium oxide, 
cement, quartz powder, casein, dyes or milk-of-lime are used as auxiliary agents. 
Insulating material as claimed in Claim 1 characterised by the fact that the textile, 
plant or inorganic fibres are between 10 and 30 mm in length and consist of shredded 

rags, straw, grasses or glass fibres. 
Process for manufacturing insulating material as claimed in Claim 1 characterised by 
the fact that 50 - 70 % shredded waste paper and/or shredded board, in relation to the 

total mass of the finished product, including 0 - 30 % fibre content, is mixed with a 
water glass solution with a solids concentration between 20 and 50 %, in relation to the 

total mass of the finished product, to which mix auxiliary agents are added if necessary 
in accordance with its intended application in a proportion between 0 and 30 % of the  

 
total mass and the pourable mass thus produced is expanded using air and/or CO
2
 and 
finally subjected to a drying process. 
Process for manufacturing insulating material as claimed in Claim 1 characterised by 
the fact that 


following the above process, finely chipped wood or finely chipped wood waste or 
sawings or finely chipped windfall or finely chipped industrial timber waste or finely 

shredded grasses (bamboo, straw) or mixtures of the aforementioned materials are 
predried, then subjected to a vacuum at between 50 and 90 Â°C and finally pressurised 

with a mix of milk-of-lime and water glass solution where the ratio of milk-of-lime to 
water glass solution ranges between 1:1 and 1:4 in relation to the solids concentration, 
the moist mix thus created is mixed with a water glass solution either on its own or 
together with shredded waste paper and/or shredded board containing textile, plant or 

inorganic fibres and further auxiliary agents are added to this mix if necessary 
according to its intended application, 
whereby the water glass solution in the treated shredded material is offset against the 
total amount of the water glass solution and the proportion of milk-of-lime is offset 

against the total amount of auxiliary agents are added to this mix if necessary 
according to its intended application, 
and the pourable mass thus manufactured is expanded using air and/or CO
2
 and finally 
subjected to a drying process. 
Process for manufacturing insulating material as claimed in Claims 5 and 6 
characterised by the fact that an organic acid, preferably acetic acid, is added directly 

to the foam or following shaping of the pourable mass or foam to accelerate hardening. 
Use of insulating materials as claimed in Claim 1 as packing, insulating, construction 
and/or insulating material in the building and packaging industry.
