<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the synthesis of a hydrazone  beta -keto ester by the reaction of an alkyl diazo ester with a hydrazone aldehyde in the presence of a Lewis acid. In a preferred embodiment, the hydrazone  beta -keto ester is then converted into a pyridazinone compound by the reaction with an alkyl acid chloride in the presence of a base, followed by acidification. The present invention also relates to a continuous process for the production of a hydrazone aldehyde comprising contacting a hydrazine and glyoxal, wherein the hydrazine and the glyoxal are added simultaneously to a reactor at a controlled rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a process for making pyridazinone
derivatives and a hydrazone aldehyde precursor.Certain carboxy substituted 4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridazines and carboalkoxy
substituted 4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridazines are known in the art to have plant gametocidal
activity and plant growth regulatory activity. Current methods for producing the above
compounds typically use expensive raw materials and/or result in low yields of product. For
example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,707,181; 5,026,880; and 4,732,603 disclose preparing the
above compounds by reacting a 2-phenylhydrazono-3-oxoglutarate with an organic acid
chloride in the presence of a Grignard reagent (isopropyl magnesium chloride). The
Grignard reagents are expensive and low yields are obtained. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,189,163
and 5,010,192 also disclose using expensive raw materials, such as methyl-3-oxopentanoate,
and result in low yields.The present invention provides a more efficient process for making pyridazinone
derivatives which results in higher yields of product and uses lower cost raw materials,
hydrazone aldehyde and diazo acetate.Hydrazone aldehydes are useful as precursors in the production of the carboxy
substituted 4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyridazines and carboalkoxy substituted 4-oxo-1,4dihydropyridazines
mentioned above. Such hydrazone aldehydes, such as 4-chlorophenylhydrazone
aldehyde (ethanedial, mono[(4-chlorophenyl)hydrazone]), have
typically been made by batch processes, wherein one reactant is added to a reactor 
containing the other reactant. However, such batch processes lead to a lower payload (2-5%).
An increase in the payload above 5% made the reaction slurry difficult to mix and thus
resulted in by-product formation. In addition, the water content of the resulting solution is
about 80% in a batch process, making the solution difficult to wash and handle, and causing
filtration of the product to be very slow. The high water content also leads to very long
drying times of the product.An improved process to produce hydrazone aldehydes having a decreased water
content would lead to a solution which is easier to handle, and decreased filtration and
drying times of the product. The present invention relates to the synthesis of a hydrazone β-keto ester by the
reaction of a diazo ester with a hydrazone aldehyde in the presence of a Lewis acid. In a
preferred embodiment, the hydrazone β-keto ester is then converted into a pyridazinone
compound by the reaction with an alkyl acid chloride in the presence of a base, followed
