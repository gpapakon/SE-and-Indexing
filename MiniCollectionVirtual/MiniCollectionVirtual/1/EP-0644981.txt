and the perpendicular (S) thereto in the centre point, lie outside at least of that 
quadrant of the quadrants (I, IV) lying outside the tangent (T) which (1) 

contains the other end, with respect to the direction of travel, of the running 
surface (14, 532, 632), and that the crankshafts (2, 2') are arranged outside of 

the chambers (11.14, 18.14, 11'.14, 18.14', 530.532, 630.632) formed when
