<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a clamping machine is carried 
out, that includes: a frame (2) provided with a handgrip 

(3) and with a housing (4) suitable for a case (5) containing 
a certain quantity of clamps (6); a pair of pliers (9) 

for the fastening of the clamps, constituted by a pair of 
jaws (13) hinged to the frame, the rear ends of which (12) 

are connected with each other and with the mobile element 
(89) of an actuator (90) that opens and closes the pliers 

(9) by means of a junction element; an extractor (8) sliding 
on the frame (2), for the extraction of the clamps (6, 

25) from the case (5) one after the other and suitable for 
placing them in clamping position between the jaws (13) of 

the pliers (9). Said junction element is a fork (88) sliding 
on the frame (2) and fixed on one side directly to the 

mobile element (89) of the actuator (90) and on the opposite 
side to the rear ends (12) of the jaws (13) of the 

pliers (9) by means of the same hinge pin (87) that can be 
connected with the extractor (8). Further, said fork (88) 

and said frame (2) support the means(14, 30, 33, 17, 18) 
engaging and disengaging said pin (87) with the extractor 

(8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is an automatic clamping machine. Clamping machines are known, by means of which particular 
packaging jobs are carried out, for example in the field of 
packing, upholstery, metal structural works and in the 
manufacture of stress bars for reinforced concrete and 
alike. In particular, the manufacture of stress bars for reinforced 
concrete is carried out with a known type of clamping 
machine, basically constituted by a frame equipped with a 
handgrip and a case containing a certain quantity of metal 
clamps. These clamps are extracted one after the other and 
fastened by means of pliers projecting from the front part 
of the frame itself. The pliers consist of two jaws, opposed to each other, 
between which the metal clamp to be fastened is placed: the 
external perimeter of the clamp coincides with the internal 
perimeter of the pliers. When the operator who is using the clamping machine presses 
a push button or moves a lever, he operates those mechanical 
parts of the clamping machine that close the jaws of 
the pliers, in such a way as to fasten the clamp around the 
element or elements that must be secured together. When the push button or the lever are released, the pliers 
open again and during this phase they extract a new clamp 
from the case and put it between the jaws, ready to clamp 
it as soon as they are closed by means of the push button 
or of the control lever. In the known clamping machines, while the pliers, which are 
arc-shaped, are closing, the clamp always adheres to the 
jaws, so that when the pliers are completely closed and the 
clamp is completely fastened, the latter takes the shape of 
an eyelet, which is substantially the configuration of the 
closed pliers. This means that the pliers cannot let the clamp adhere to  
 
the element or elements around which it is fastened, unless 
the element or elements in their junction point have a 
perimeter equal to the internal perimeter of the eyelet 
formed by the clamp when it is closed. In conclusion, the pliers can fasten the clamp around 
bodies the section of which has a shape similar to that of 
the closed pliers and having a perimeter equal to the 
internal perimeter of the clamp when the pliers are closed. 
This represents a considerable inconvenience, since the 
user, when he has to clamp elements having different measures, 
is forced to employ and therefore to buy more than one 
clamping machine, each one provided with pliers with different 
dimensions and making use of clamps having different 
dimensions,

<CLAIMS>
Clamping machine comprising: 

a frame (2) provided with a handgrip (3) and with a 
housing (4) suitable for a case (5) containing a certain 

quantity of clamps (6); 
pliers (9) for fastening the clamps, constituted by a 
pair of jaws (13) hinged to the frame, the rear ends of 

which (12) are connected with each other and with the 
mobile element (89) of an actuator (90) that provides for 

the opening and closing of the pliers (9) by means of a 
junction element; 
an extractor (8) sliding on the frame (2) for the extraction 
of the clamps (6, 25) from the case (5) one after the 

other and suitable for placing them in clamping position 
between the jaws (13) of the pliers (9), 
 
characterized in that said junction element is a fork (88)
