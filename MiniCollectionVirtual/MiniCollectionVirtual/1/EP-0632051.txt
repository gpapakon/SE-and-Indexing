<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a group of novel 
compounds that inhibit the proteolytic activity of 3C 

proteases which are found in picornaviruses, particularly 
rhinoviruses. In picornaviruses the RNA genome is 

translated into a single large viral polyprotein precursor. 
The precursor demonstrates auto-proteolytic activity, 

cleaving itself into mature viral gene products. 
Therefore, compounds of the current invention are 

particularly useful in treating picornaviral infections by 
interrupting the processing of the viral gene products into 

mature and infectious viral particles. The current 
invention also provides a novel process the preparation of 

compounds of the current invention. The process entails 
the selective reduction of 
an imide intermediate 
representing a marked improvement over processes known in 

the art for making peptidyl-aldehydes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the discovery that a 
group of peptidyl-aldehydes is useful in the inhibition of 
picornaviral 3C proteases. Picornaviridae are a family of very small non-enveloped 
viruses having a core of capsid-enclosed 
positive-stranded RNA. The picornaviruses represent a wide 
variety of microbes which infect a broad range of animals, 
including humans. Examples of picornaviruses include 
rhinoviruses, enteroviruses (e.g. poliovirus, 
coxsackievirus, echovirus), cardioviruses (e.g. 
encephalomyocarditis virus, meningovirus), aphthoviruses 
(e.g. foot-and-mouth disease virus), and hepatitis A virus, 
among others. In picornaviruses the RNA genome is translated 
into a single large viral polyprotein precursor. The 
precursor demonstrates auto-proteolytic activity, cleaving 
itself into mature viral gene products. Proteolytic 
cleavage, therefore, plays an important role in the 
regulation of picornavirus replication and may thus 
represent an ideal target for antiviral therapy of all 
picornaviruses, including human rhinoviruses. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are one of the major 
causes of upper respiratory tract infections collectively 
known as the common cold. Despite considerable effort in 
identifying therapeutics for this malady, no safe and 
effective therapy is currently available. Perhaps the most 
recalcitrant problem plaguing researchers in the area is 
the propensity for these viruses to mutate and thus develop 
resistance to potential medicaments. Vaccine therapy 
proves to be problematic for this very reason, and 
chemotherapy appears to be the more desirable approach. In the case of the human rhinoviruses, there are 
two proteolytic enzymes involved, namely 2A and 3C, both of  
 
which are believed to be sulfhydryl proteases. Since these 
viral enzymes have no known cellular counterparts, it may 
be possible to selectively inhibit these enzymes in the 
presence of host enzymes. That is, chemotherapeutic agents 
having activity directed against the viral proteases would 
not affect endogenous cellular enzymes. It appears that members of the picornavirus 
family may all code for a substantially homologous viral 3C 
protease, and in all picornaviruses studied, 3C protease 
activity is required for the virus to undergo maturation. 
Based on experience with other virally encoded proteolytic 
enzymes such as HIV-1 protease, it is unlikely that the 
viruses will develop resistance to inhibitors of these 
proteases. Moreover, the highly conserved nature of the 3C 
enzyme itself and the
