<DESCRIPTION>
 LIQUID FUEL OVERFLOW PREVENTION SYSTEM Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to overflow prevention systems and more particularly to an overflow prevention system for a liquid fuel barge or other vessel.Background ArtRecent increases in environmental concerns regarding oil and gasoline spills in our waterways and oceans have necessitated a new look at traditional methods of loading petroleum products onto floating conveyances. Originally, little regard was given to general safety or to potential environmental risks. Cargos of various petroleum distillates, such as gasoline were pumped aboard barges whose compartment hatches were left open. The bargeman observed the rising level of the product by peering down through open compartment hatches. This method was extremely dangerous. It not only exposed the bargeman to potential health risks because of the exposure to fumes, but it exposed the waterways to the potential hazards of overflowing and explosions.New government mandates curbing these antiquated practices have recently been enacted. Petroleum products in general, and gasoline products in particular, can no longer be jumped aboard barges with open hatches. Utilization of totally closed tank filling systems is now required. The access hatches must be tightly secured during product loading and noxious fumes or vapors must be pumped out during the loading process by means of vapor collection manifolds. The recovered vapors must be piped ashore and processed through various methods to remove the hydrocarbons before the gases can be vented to the atmosphere.Liquid levels must now be automatically sensed during loading by means of floats, sonar, or other devices. As a back-up, the observation of the product as it rises in the storage compartments may be viewed through sight glasses, but the compartments must remain tightly sealed. Also, there must be adequate valves and other devices to 

 avert spills of the product to the seas or waterways and alarms with manual and automatic shutdown capability of pumping facilities.The compartments for the holding of petroleum products are laid out symmetrically with respect to the keel of the vessel. Therefore, in most cases, the compartments are positioned longitudinally along the length of the ship in two rows, a line of compartments on the port side of the ship and another line of compartments on the starboard side of the ship. To maintain trim, the compartments must be loaded in a predetermined sequence.In order to prevent overfill/overflow while
