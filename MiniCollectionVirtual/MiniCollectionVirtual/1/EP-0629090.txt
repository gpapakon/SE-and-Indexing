<ABSTRACT>
A video image processing system comprises an input 
cache store (3) for temporarily storing input video 

data, compressors (13, 15) for compressing image data 
from the input store and an output store (17) comprising 

multiple storage areas (19) of known fixed size for 
storing respective files of compressed data from the 

compressors (13, 15). The compressors are arranged to 
compress each image of the input video data to a given 

initial degree to produce respective data files. A 
processor (16) compares the number of bytes in each data 

file with the known size of one storage area (19) in the 
output stor
e (17) to determine whether the data file 
will occupy a predetermined proportion of said storage 

area. In the event that the data file will not occupy 
said predetermined portion of said storage area, the 

processor causes one of the compressors to effect one or 
more repeat compressions to a different degree in order 

to produce a data file of a size which will occupy said 
predetermined proportion of said storage. The system 

thereby optimises the compression of data and the 
utilisation of storage in the storing of the compressed 

data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video image 
processing system. In a video image processing system video image 
fields or frames to be processed are represented by 
digital image data defining a multiplicity of picture 
elements (pixels) which together form the field or 
frame. In a 625 line or similarly sized video system 
each video frame typically requires about 800 K Bytes 
of data to represent all of the pixels forming the 
frame. Often image processing is applied to selected 
frames of a video clip comprising multiple frames and 
in order to facilitate the processing of the clip it 
is desirable to make available the data representing 
each frame on a frame random access basis. That is to 
say the time taken to access data representing any 
frame in the clip is substantially the same as the 
time taken to access the data for any other frame in 
the clip. Frame random access storage devices are known. 
One such device comprises multiple disc stores 
arranged so that together they are able to receive and 
to output data at video display rate (e.g. 25 or 30 
frames per second). Video stores are now available 
which comprise several disc storage devices connected 
together in parallel so as to enable several minutes 
of video to be stored on a frame random access basis.  
 
However, the cost of such store devices is relatively 
high and can be prohibitively expensive. It is desirable that storage of data representing 
image sequences should be operated with a fixed file 
size, that is to say, with a store in which equal 
capacity is allocated for storage of the data relating 
to each image of the sequence. Where the stored image 
data is uncompressed, as is normally the case in an 
on-line system, such a store is the natural form to be 
adopted. However, the use of a store of fixed file 
size in an off-line system, where the image data is 
compressed before being stored, presents difficulties 
because the image data compression will result in 
files of data of different sizes for different images. In an off-line system the number of video frames 
storable in a store of a given capacity can be 
increased (and the amount of storage space required 
can be reduced) by way of compression of the video 
data prior to storage. Data compression techniques 
are now sufficiently advanced to enable video data to 
be compressed with only small and acceptable losses in 
the quality of the image when the data is subsequently 
decompressed. Generally, when a compression technique is 
applied to video data, the resulting
