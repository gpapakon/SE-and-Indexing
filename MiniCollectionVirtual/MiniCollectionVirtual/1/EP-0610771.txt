<ABSTRACT>
A basic cell (1) for a CMOS gate array contains MOS transistors (2, ..., 9), of which the diffusion zones and gate electrodes can be directly connected to local conductor track sections (30, ..., 36). The local conductor track sections are preferably made from silicide. Transistors arranged in pairs and respectively of one conductivity type (2, 4) preferably have a common diffusion zone (12) whose capacitively active surface area is twice as large as the surface area of an individual diffusion zone (10, 14). By arranging a further transistor (18, 19) with a relatively low length-to-side ratio in the basic cell (1), it is possible to implement analog and memory circuits favourably in terms of surface area.
