<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing polycarbonates by the 
interfacial reaction of phosgene bisphenol in a two 

phase reaction medium of an aqueous hydroxide and an 
organic solvent is disclosed. In the reaction, the 

amount of water in the reaction medium is controlled 
such that high ionic strength conditions resulting from 

high salt concentrations are reached at the end of 
phosgenation and the pH of the medium is controlled to 

a range between 8 and 10 whereby excess phosgene usage 
is less than about 15% of theoretical conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
Polycarbonates are commonly prepared by an
interfacial process in which phosgene is reacted with
biphenols (e.g. bisphenol-A) using a two phase reaction
medium of an aqueous solution (e.g. sodium hydroxide)
and an organic solvent (e.g. methylene chloride).
Optimum reaction conditions for rapid polymerization
and high yield of polymer typically involve a pH value
of the medium of about 10 to 11. Alkali salts are
formed during the course of the reaction as phosgene is
consumed. The reaction medium normally contains
sufficient water to completely dissolve all salts to
form a brine phase. Due to undesired side reactions,
a portion of the phosgene is wasted and complete
consumption of the biphenol typically requires phosgene
usage in excess of 15 percent above stoichiometrically
predicted amounts.US-A-3989672 discloses an interfacial process for
the preparation of polycarbonates by reaction of
phosgene with bisphenol-A in which alkali metal
hydroxide is added to maintain a pH of between 8.0 and
10.2 during the entire reaction.US-A-3035020 discloses a process for preparing
polycarbonate resins which comprises reacting phosgene
with a dihydric phenol in a reaction medium comprising
an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide, an
inert organic solvent, and a water soluble salt of an
alkali metal and a strong mineral acid, said water
soluble salt being present substantially throughout
the reaction period in an amount of at least 20
weight percent based on the weight of dihydric phenol
initially present and being exclusive of any inorganic
salt formed in situ as a result of the reaction of
phosgene with the alkali metal salt of the said
dihydric phenol. The present invention is based upon the discovery
that in a process for producing polycarbonates, excess
phosgene usage can be reduced from previous interfacial
conditions by reducing the water volume in the reaction
medium such that high ionic strength resulting from a
high salt concentration is reached near the end of
phosgenation, and by reducing the pH of the medium to
a value between 8 and 10.In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a
method for producing polycarbonates by the interfacial
reaction of phosgene (COCl2) and bisphenol-A (BPA) in
a two phase reaction medium including an aqueous
hydroxide and an organic solvent wherein alkali salts 
are formed as phosgene is consumed. According to this
embodiment, the method comprises the steps of:
controlling the amount of water such that the
concentration of salts in
the aqueous phase
reaches at least
