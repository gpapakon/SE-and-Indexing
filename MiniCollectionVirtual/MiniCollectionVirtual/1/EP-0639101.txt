<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
separating immiscible liquids
and more especially for separating a
surface layer of liquid of lower density from a body
of liquid of higher density on which it is floating.
The invention is especially suited to the removal of
floating oil from the surface of water.
US-A-3962093 discloses a suction device for removing a
floating surface layer from a liquid body in which passage
of the surface layer into a suction nozzle located below the
liquid surface is assisted by directing a stream of liquid
downwards into the surface from directly above the suction
nozzle.The invention provides a method for the separation of a less
dense liquid from a body of a more dense liquid on which it
is floating, which comprises passing an annular column of
liquid at high velocity substantially vertically from within
the body of liquid through the surface thereof thereby to
entrain less dense liquid and to carry it away from the
surface and collecting the mixture of less dense liquid and
other liquid(s) thereby produced.The invention also provides apparatus for the separation of
a less dense liquid from a body of more dense liquid on
which it is floating, which comprises means for generating
a high-velocity annular column of carrier liquid, means for
directing said column upwardly through the body of liquid
and the floating layer of less dense liquid, whereby a layer
of less dense liquid is entrained by the surface of the
column of carrier liquid, and means for directing said
carrier liquid and entrained less dense liquid to a
collector device.According to a first embodiment of the invention, the
apparatus comprises a support rod which at one end has an
outwardly and upwardly flared portion defining a
spreader device and at the other end is surrounded by
a coaxial tube which is spaced from the rod to define
an annular passage which terminates at a point spaced
from the narrowest point of the spreader device, means
connecting the tube to means for pumping a carrier
liquid through the annular passage towards the
spreader device and a collector positioned below the
spreader device and having an aperture in its base to
receive the support rod and allow passage of the
column of carrier liquid. In operation of the apparatus, the apparatus is
supported relative to the body of liquid so that the
lower end of the support rod and its surrounding tube
are below the surface and the spreader device and the
collector are above the surface. A carrier liquid is
pumped into the lower end of

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the separation of a less dense liquid
[12]
 from a body of more dense liquid [13] on which it is

floating, which comprises means [1, 7] for generating a

high-velocity annular column [14] of carrier liquid, means

[1, 7] for directing said column upwardly through the body

of liquid and the floating layer of less dense liquid,
whereby a layer [15]
 of less dense liquid is entrained by
the surface of the column of carrier liquid, and means [3]

for directing said carrier liquid and entrained less dense
liquid to a collector device [11]
.
Apparatus according to claim 1 comprising a support rod
[1]
 which at one end [2] has an outwardly and upwardly

flared portion [3] defining a spreader device and at the

other end [6] is surrounded by a coaxial tube [7]
 which is
spaced from the rod to define an annular passage [8]
 which
terminates at a point spaced from the narrowest point of the

spreader device, means connecting the tube to means for
pumping a carrier liquid through the annular passage towards

the spreader device and a collector [11] positioned below

the spreader device and having an aperture [16] in its base 

to receive the support rod and allow passage of the column
of carrier liquid.
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the spreader
device [3]
 has a re-entrant portion [4,5] in its peripheral

region to deflect liquid downwardly into the collector.
Apparatus according to claim 1 comprising a support rod
[1]
 carrying at one end [2] a diverter device [3]
 having an
outwardly and downwardly 
curved surface [4, 5] facing the

rod, a first tubular portion coaxially surrounding the rod
and spaced therefrom to define a collector device [11]
, a
second tubular portion [9]
 surrounding a lower part of the
first tubular portion and spaced therefrom to provide an

annular passage [8] which terminates at a level below the

diverter device and means for forcing liquid through the
annular passage to impinge on the curved surface of the

diverter device to be diverted inwardly towards the support
rod and into the collector device.
Apparatus according to claim 4 wherein the curved
surface [4,5]
 of the diverter device is a Coanda surface.
Apparatus according to claim 4 or claim 5 wherein means
associated with the diverter device are arranged to create

a flow of fluid over the surface from out-to-in, to assist
in directing the impinging liquid towards the support rod. 
A method for the separation of a less dense liquid [12]
from a body of a more dense liquid [13]
 on which it is
floating, which comprises passing an annular column [14]
 of
liquid at high velocity substantially vertically from within

the body of liquid through the surface thereof thereby to
entrain less dense liquid [15]
 and to carry it away from the
surface and collecting the mixture of less dense liquid and

other liquid(s) thereby produced. 
A method according to claim 7 wherein there is used
apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 6.
