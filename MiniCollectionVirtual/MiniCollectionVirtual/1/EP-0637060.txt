<ABSTRACT>
The isolation between adjacent intra-polycrystalline 
sil
icon layer components of one or more polycrystalline silicon layers of 
an integrated circuit device may be enhanced by patterning and then 

implanting one or 
more such polycrystalline silicon layers with a high dose of oxygen or 

nitrogen, in the 
range of approximately 1x10¹⁷/cm² to 1x10¹⁹/cm². A post 

implant anneal is performed 
in either nitrogen or argon to form a layer of either silicon dioxide or silicon nitride having 

desirable planar characteristics. The anneal is performed at a 
temperature range of approximately 1000 to 1400 degrees Celsius.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the isolation of intra-polycrystalline 
silicon structures, and more specifically to integrated circuit devices, including thin film 
transistor (TFT) structures. Sufficient isolation between adjacent active components in a polycrystalline silicon 
layer of an integrated circuit device is often critical to the proper electrical function of the 
device. Insufficient isolation may cause a variety of problems, including leakage current 
and potential electrical shorts between such intra-polycrystalline silicon layer 
components. And, if the device is stressed by environmental factors such as high-voltage 
or high-radiation, isolation becomes more of a concern. In the manufacture of polycrystalline silicon devices, it is common in the art to 
utilize a patterning and dry etching process to remove selected portions of a 
polycrystalline silicon layer between adjacent intra-polycrystalline silicon components.  
 
Due to factors such as poor etch selectivity, small amounts of polycrystalline silicon, 
known as stringers in the processing art, may be left behind. Stringers can contribute 
to leakage current and electrical shorting between adjacent intra-polycrystalline silicon 
components. Attempts to eradicate stringers by deeper etching has proved only partially 
successful, due to selectivity problems, and overetching can cause punch-through or 
puncturing of underlying layers. Additionally, dry etching of polycrystalline silicon layers 
may adversely affect device topography and therefore device planarity. The dry etch problems described above are exacerbated for thin film transistor 
(TFT) devices which lend themselves to high density, high speed applications, such as 
video display chips for flat-screen applications. For TFT devices, isolation and planarity 
are especially desirable characteristics. However, current methods for manufacturing 
TFT devices call for the patterning and etching of various polycrystalline silicon layers, 
which can result in insufficient device isolation and undesirable device topography. For 
example, patterning and then etching the third polycrystalline silicon layer of a three 
polycrystalline silicon layer device may not completely remove the third polycrystalline 
silicon layer, leaving behind stringers of the third polycrystalline silicon layer. Such 
stringers would adversely affect isolation between adjacent third polycrystalline silicon 
layer components. As a result of the well known problems associated with patterning and
