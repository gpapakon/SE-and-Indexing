<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to substituted and unsubstituted 
naphthalenyl-3H-1,2,3,5-oxathiadiazole 2-oxides, to 
processes for their preparation, to methods for using the 
compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. 
The compounds have phamaceutical properties which render them 
beneficial for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and 
associated conditions. The serious complications of diabetes mellitus such as nephropathy, 
retinopathy, neuropathy and cataract are all associated with an excessive 
amount of blood glucose. The major therapeutic objective is therefore the 
normalization of blood glucose, both in the fasting and postprandial situations. The therapeutic approaches to the treatment of Non-Insulin Dependent 
Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM, Type II) involve the use of diet, insulin or orally 
active hypoglycemic agents. Presently, such orally active hypoglycemic agents 
are chosen (a) from sulfonylureas such as chloropropamide, glyburide and others 
or (b) biguanides such as metformin and related products. Both these groups of 
agents have serious disadvantages. Sulfonylureas, upon chronic use, lose their 
effectiveness. In contrast, biguanides suffer from a serious side effect, lactic­
acidosis. More recently, oxazolidinedione (U.S. Patent 4,342,771) and thiazolidine­
dione (European Patent Application No. 117,035) derivatives have been described 
as useful hypoglycemic agents. U.S. Patent 4,461,902 discloses substituted 5-[(4-­
cyclohexyl-methoxyphenyl)methyl]thiazolidine-2,4-diones of formula 
 
wherein R is methyl(ciglitazone) and related analogues as hypoglycemic agents.  This invention provides compounds represented 
by formula (I) 
 
wherein R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen, lower 
alkyl containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkoxy containing 
1 to 6 carbon atoms, ethynyl, methylthio, nitro, 
halogen, nitrile, trifluoromethyl, vinyl or benzyloxy 
in which the phenyl group is optionally substituted by 
one or more substituents selected from halogen, lower 
alkyl containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms and alkoxy 
containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms; Z is 
 
wherein R³ is hydrogen, lower alkyl containing 1 to 3 
carbon atoms, alkoxy containing 1 to 2 carbon atoms, or 
benzyl; R⁴ is lower alkyl containing 1 to 3 carbon 
atoms, alkoxy containing 1 to 2 carbon atoms, or 
benzyl; n¹ is 0, 1, or 2; n² is 0, 1, or 2; or Z is 
-S-CH₂-,-SO₂-CH₂-CH₂-,or-OCH₂-; or Z is-C(R⁵)=C(R⁶)-,
