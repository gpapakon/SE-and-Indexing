<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for moistening a moving web of material (10), in particular for moistening again a printed then dried printed material. As soon as possible after the thermal drying process is concluded, preferably in the area of the cooling cylinders, a moistening agent is pressed on one or both sides of the web of material (10) by an applicator (12) by means of a smooth cylinder (15), against a guiding element (11).

Process and device for moistening a moving printed then thermally 
dried web o
f material (10), especially a paper web that is cooled 
after drying and is guided during the cooling phase over a cooled 

guide element (11) while being wetted, on a least one face, with a 
moistening film which is applied on a roller (15) of a roller 

arrangement (14, 15) in contact with the guide element (11) and 
is transferred from the latter to the web (10),
characterised in that
 
the moistening film, which is produced by spraying and is applied 

onto the roller (15) in metered quantities, is pressed at a defined 
pressure into the web of material (10), while the latter is still hot 

and dry, by rolling it onto the web as the latter passes between 
the guide element (11) and the roller (15). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the web (10), 
after having been wetted with the moistening agent, is then 

passed through an electric high-voltage field, being thus 
electrostatically charged. 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that electrostatic 
charging of the web (10) trough the electrically conductive guide 

element (11) occurs before the web leaves the guide element and 
within the area of application of the moistening agent.  

 
Process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that for forming a moistening film a moistening agent is sprayed 

onto another roller (14) of the roller arrangement (14, 15). 
Process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the web 10) is wetted with a moistening agent on both faces. 
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that the two faces 
of the web (10) are wetted one after the other. 
Process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the moistening agent is applied on the web (10) in several 

successive steps. 
Process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the moistening agent is pure water or water containing 

admixtures. 
Process according to claim 8, characterized in that the admixtures 
added to the water are tensides or other chemical substances that 

influence the surface tension and/or the diffusion properties or the 
electric characteristics of the water. 
Process according to any of the preceding claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that electrostatic charging is effected with a 

positive or, preferably, a negative high voltage in the range of 10 
kV to approximately 45 kV.  

 
Process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the moistening agent is maintained at a constant temperature 

before being applied on the web (10). 
Process according to claim 12, characterized in that the 
moistening agent is maintained at a temperature of between 15° 

C and 50° C. 
Device for carrying out the process according to any of the 
preceding claims, having a moistening agent application device 

(12) comprising cooled guide elements (11) for guiding the web of 
material (10), a moistening agent spray device (13) and at least 

one roller (15) of a roller arrangement that acts upon the guide 
element (11) at a defined pressure, wherein a moistening film, 

that is to be applied in metered quantity onto the roller (15), can 
be produced by means of the moistening agent spray device (13) 

and the moistening film produced by the moistening agent spray 
device can be pressed at a defined pressure into the web of 

material, while the latter is still hot and while it passes between 
the cooled guide element (11) and the roller. 
Device according to claim 13, characterized in that the guide 
element is a driven cooling roller (11). 
Device according to claim 13 or 14, characterized in that the roller

surface by the moistening agent spray device (13).  
 
Device according to any of the preceding claims 13 to 15, 
characterized in that a charging device is arranged behind the 

moistening agent spray device (12), in the direction of movement 
(B) of the web (10), for electrostatically charging the wetted web
