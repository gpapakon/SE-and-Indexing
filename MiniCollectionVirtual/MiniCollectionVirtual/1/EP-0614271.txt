<ABSTRACT>
For surface acoustic wave arrangements, temperature-compensated piezoelectric crystal elements having at least one planar surface are used. An improvement in the temperature stability can be expected if the crystal element (1) consists of GaPO4 and the planar surface (3) is determined by the Euler angle  lambda  in the range of 0@,  mu  in the range of 40@ to 75@, preferably 50@ to 60@, and  theta  in the range of 0@.

<CLAIMS>
Piezoelectric crystal element with at least one substantially 
planar surface, to be used in surface acoustic wave devices, 


characterized in that
 the crystal element (1) is made from GaPO
4
 
and the planar surface (3) is defined by Euler angles lambda of 

0° substantially, µ in the range of 40° to 75°, i.e., preferably 
50' to 60°, and  of 0° substantially. 
Crystal element as in claim 1, with interdigital transducers, 

characterized in that
 the product of period length of the 
interdigital transducers (Ia, Ie) and center frequency of the 

surface acoustic wave device is between 2,250 and 2,400 µm MHz. 
Crystal element as in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
crystal element (1) is substantially configured as a wafer. 
Crystal element as in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in 
that
 the crystal element (1) is part of a chemical sensor and is 
covered entirely or partially by a sensitive layer (4) and, if 

required, by a reference layer (4'). 
Crystal element as in claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the 
sensitive layer (4) is heat resistant up to 900°C.
