<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns aqueous surfactant 
composition comprising poly hydroxy fatty acid amides of 

the formula (A): 

 
wherein R2 is C11-C19 alkyl, alkenyl or mixtures thereof; 
Z is a polyhydroxyhydrocarbyl moiety having a linear 

hydrocarbyl chain with at least 3 hydroxyls directly 
connected to the chain; and

 
in a part of the total amide surfactant (a) R1 is a methyl 

group and in the remainder of the total amide surfactant 
(b) R1 is an alkyl group with from 3 to 8 carbon atoms; 

said composition further comprising (c) from 0% to 15% by 
weight of an organic solvent;

 
wherein the ratio of N-methyl poly hydroxy fatty acid amide 

(a) to N-alkyl (C3-C8) polyhydroxy fatty acid amide (b), is 
from 25:1 to 1:1. 
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the 
surfactant composition is prepared by mixing N-methyl poly 

hydroxy fatty acid amine and N-propyl poly hydroxy fatty 
acid amine, and reacting said mixture with a fatty acid 

ester reactant in the presence of a base catalyst and, 
preferably, in the presence of a reaction solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain mixtures of N-alkyl 
polyhydroxy fatty acid amide detersive surfactants and 
their method of synthesis. The formulation of detergent compositions presents a 
considerable challenge, since effective compositions are 
required to remove a variety of soils and stains from 
diverse substrates. In particular, the removal of 
greasy/oily soils quickly and efficiently can be 
problematic. While a review of the literature would seem 
to indicate that a wide selection of surfactants is 
available to the detergent manufacturer, the reality is 
that many such materials are specialty chemicals which are  
 
not suitable in low unit cost items such as home-use 
detergent compositions. The fact remains that most home-use 
detergents still comprise one or more of the 
conventional ethoxylated nonionic and sulfated or 
sulfonated anionic surfactants, presumably due to economic 
considerations. The challenge to the detergent manufacturer seeking improved 
fabric cleaning has been increased by various environmental 
factors. For example, some nonbiodegradable ingredients 
have fallen into disfavor. Effective phosphate builders 
have been banned by legislation in many countries. 
Moreover, many surfactants are often available only from 
nonrenewable resources such as petrochemicals. 
Accordingly, the detergent manufacturer is quite limited in 
the selection of surfactants which are effective cleaners, 
biodegradable and, to the extent possible, available from 
renewable resources such as natural fats and oils, rather 
than petrochemicals. Considerable attention has lately been directed to nonionic 
surfactants which can be prepared by using mainly renewable 
resources, such as fatty esters and sugars. One such class 
of surfactants includes the N-alkyl polyhydroxy fatty acid 
amides. Moreover, the combination of such nonionic 
surfactants with conventional anionic surfactants such as 
the alkyl sulfates, alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl ether 
sulfates, and the like has also been studied. Indeed,  
 
substantial success in the formulation of dishwashing 
compositions has recently been achieved using the N-alkyl 
polyhydroxy fatty acid amides. However, even these 
superior surfactants do suffer from some drawbacks. For 
example, their solubility is not as high as might be 
desired for optimal formulations and this is exacerbated at 
chain lengths of about C₁₆ and above. At high 
concentrations in water they can be difficult to handle, 
store and pump, so additives must be employed in
