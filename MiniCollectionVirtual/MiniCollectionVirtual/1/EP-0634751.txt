<ABSTRACT>
A memory includes a number of memory groups. Each 
memory group includes a set of memory subgroups and a 

number of data bus drivers, wherein each data bus driver 
has a true input and a complement input and a true output 

and a complement output. The true and complement inputs 
are connected to a memory subgroup by at least one sense 

amplifier. A true connection point also is included in 
the memory, and the true output of one of the data bus 

drivers from each of the memory groups are connected 
together at the connection point, and a "wired" 

configuration is created. In addition, the memory 
includes a complement connection point, wherein the 

complement output of one of the data bus drivers from each 
of the memory groups are connected together at the 

connection point, creating a "wired" configuration. The 
memory also has a data bus circuit with a true input 

connected to the true connection point and a complement 
input connected to the complement connection point and a 

first circuit. This data bus circuit is responsive to 
signals from the true and complement connection points 

created by the simultaneous addressing of multiple groups 
or a subset of the memory subgroups in testing mode. The 

first circuit has an output for providing an indication of 
an error in addressing of the multiple groups or the 

subset of the memory subgroups.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to
integrated circuits and in particular to
semiconductor memories. Still more particularly, the
present invention relates to a method and system for
testing semiconductor memories.This application is related to European Patent
Application Publication Nos. EP-A-0632594 and EP-A-0632389.Memories are devices that respond to operational
orders, usually from a central processing unit. Memories
may store large quantities of information in a digital
format. In a memory system or unit, addresses are used to
access the contents of the memory unit. A binary digit,
a bit, is the basic information element stored in memory.
The smallest subdivision of a memory unit into which a bit
of information can be stored is called a memory cell. A
memory on a chip is physically arranged as a two-dimensional
array of cells, wherein rows of cells are
connected by row lines or, also called word lines. A
column of cells are connected by a column line, also
called a bit line. These memory cells may be constructed
by various configurations of transistors and/or
capacitors.In constructing semiconductor memories, it is
desirable to test the memory cells to identify and locate
defective memory cells or errors in processing.
Additionally, memories are tested to determine the speed
and performance of a memory. As the sizes of memories
increase and as the quantities of memories produced
increase, testing of these memories throughout the 
different stages of processing increases the amount of
time and cost needed to produce a semiconductor memory.More information on semiconductor memories may be
found in Haznedar, Digital Microelectronics, the Benjamin/Cummings
Publishing Company, Inc. (1991). Prince, Semiconductor
Memories, John Wiley and Sons (2d Ed. 1991).A prior art document, "Proceedings of the IEEE 1987,
Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, page 600"
discloses a circuit for testing a memory in which the
outputs of plural sense amplifiers are connected to a
pair of external bit lines and the external bit lines
monitored to determine when a fault occurs.As a result, it would be desirable to have a method
and system for rapidly testing semiconductor memories.According to the present invention there is provided
a memory comprising a number of memory groups, wherein
each memory group includes a set of memory subgroups a
number of data bus drivers, wherein each data bus driver
has a true input and a complement input and a true output
and a complement output, the true and complement inputs
