<ABSTRACT>
A wire stripper has outer jaws to grip the wire 
sheath and inner jaws to cut into the sheath before the 

inner jaws are displaced along the cable relative to the 
outer jaws to strip the cut portion. An eccentric 

adjuster - Figure 2 is provided to vary the position of 
one inner jaw relative to its outer jaw so as to cope 

with widely different insulation thicknesses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wire stripping tools of
the kind comprising a pair of outer jaws which are
arranged to be closed together to grip a cable
therebetween, and a pair of inner jaws arranged to cut
into the cable to at least part sever the outer sheath of
the cable so as to enable that to be stripped off the
wire core for the purpose of baring the wire to enable a
termination to be attached. The stripping is effected
by displacing the cutting jaws relative to the gripping
jaws along the axis of the cable.The inner jaws are in effect closed together by the
outer jaws, and the degree of penetration of the cutting
edges depends upon the extent to which they project
beyond the gripping jaws. Thus, if each cutting jaw
projects say 1mm beyond the adjacent gripping jaw, then
the tool is appropriate to cut an insulation sheath of
the order of 1mm thick. In practice it is preferred to
part-sever the insulation so as to avoid the cutting edge
coming into contact with the wire core and possibly
damaging the same, and the stripping is effected by
tearing the sheath at the point of cut. Nevertheless
there is a limit to the thickness which can be stripped
for any particular depth of cut. It is therefore known
to provide an adjuster for the purpose of varying the
projection of the cutting edge relative to the gripping
face. One type of adjuster known from EP-A-0 007 699 provides a screw having the
axis perpendicular to the axis of the cable. In order to
make the adjustment predictable and repeatable, only a
single revolution of the screw is used in conjunction
with angularly movable indicia and a fixed reference
point, but these adjusters have been unsatisfactory in
that it is easily possible to turn the screw through more
than one revolution thus making the reference indication
unreliable, and if limited to the single turn, the
construction becomes complex and at best the extent of
adjustment is small. Another adjuster known from EP-A-0 099 865
uses a cam in the form of an eccentric cylinder, which moves
about an axis parallel to the cable axis. The cylinder moves a guide in
the direction transverse of the
cable axis to vary the position of the inner jaw relative to its outer jaw. 
The object of the invention is to provide
improvements. This object is achieved by the wire stripper
according to the invention, which is defined in the claims.Preferably the can is an eccentric pivotable on a
pin extending transversely of the outer jaw and having an
integral radial projection or lever extending to the
exterior of the

<CLAIMS>
A wire stripper comprising a pair of outer jaws (18,20) for
gripping the sheath of a cable, a pair of inner jaws (10, 12)

located between the outer jaws (18, 20) and arranged to be closed
together by the movement of the outer jaws (18, 20), said inner

jaws (10, 12) having cutting teeth (16) which penetrate the said sheath
and cut or part-cut the sheath to a depth dependent upon

the position of the inner jaws (10, 12) relative to the outer
jaws (18, 20), means (25) for displacing the inner jaws (10, 12) axially of

the cable when closed together to the penetrating
position so as to strip the cut portion of the sheath, and a cam (24) effective to vary the

position of one inner jaw (12) relative to its outer jaw (20) so as
to change the depth of penetration of the cutting jaw (16)

into the cable sheath,

characterised in that said cam (24) is mounted for angular
movement about an axis (26) transverse to the cable axis and

generally parallel to the gripping and cutting surfaces (16)
of the jaws (10, 12, 18, 20).
A tool as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the cam (24) is an
eccentric (24) pivotable on a pin (26) extending transversely of

the outer (20) jaw and having an integral radial projection (28)
extending to the exterior of the outer jaw (20) for ang
ularly
shifting the eccentric (24).
A tool as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein a
blade spring (30) is disposed between the cam (24) and the inner

jaw (12).
A tool as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the cam (24) is
serrated and the adjacent face of the blade spring (30) is

likewise serrated.
A tool as claimed in any preceding claim wherein a said cam (24)
is provided to vary the position of each inner jaw (10, 12).
