<ABSTRACT>
The by-pass uses an intelligent network control system which simultaneously examines access authorisations and controls a billing of an internet bypass without affecting the hard- and software of an internet user. A request for a charge-free connection from the Point-Of-Presence, at which the user dials in to the Point-Of-Presence of an internet application provider, is issued, and the network control system assigns a temporary charge-free number for the connection after checking an authentification of the user.
