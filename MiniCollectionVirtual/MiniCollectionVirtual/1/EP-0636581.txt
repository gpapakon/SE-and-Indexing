<ABSTRACT>
In a batch type electrolyzed water producing method, a first 
run of electrolysis is carried out, and electrolyzed water is 

discharged. Thereafter, before a next run of electrolysis is 
carried out, the polarity of a DC power source connected to the 

electrode plates is reversed. Thus, the electrode plate which has 
served as a cathode plate in the last run of electrolysis is 

converted into an anode plate and therefore, deposits accumulated 
on the electrode plate are ionized and dissolved into the subject 

water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method of producing
electrolyzed water and apparatus for producing electrolyzed
acidic water and electrolyzed alkaline water by electrolyzing
water to be electrolyzed (which will be referred to as subject
water hereinafter), and particularly to batch type electrolyzed
water producing method and apparatus.In the electrolyzed water producing apparatus of this type,
when subject water such as city water is supplied into an
electrolytic cell, and DC current is supplied to between
electrode plates, the electrolysis of the subject water is
carried out in the electrolytic cell. Thus, cations such as
calcium, sodium, magnesium and potassium ions contained (or
intentionally added) in the city water are collected toward a
cathode, i.e., into a cathode chamber. On the other hand, anions
such as chlorine ion contained in the city water is collected
toward an anode, i.e., into an anode chamber. During this time,
because the anode and cathode chambers are partitioned by a
membrane, only the electrolyzed acidic water is discharged
through an outlet port provided in the anode chamber, and only 
the electrolyzed alkaline water is discharged through an outlet
port provided in the cathode chamber.The prior art electrolyzed water producing apparatus are
classified into a continuous type one and a batch type one. The
continuous type one is designed so that the subject water is
electrolyzed while being continuously supplied to the
electrolytic cell, and electrolyzed water is continuously
supplied. On the other hand, batch type one is designed so that
the subject water is temporarily accumulated in the electrolytic
cell and then electrolyzed therein, and resulting electrolyzed
water is supplied.From the viewpoint that the electrolyzed water can be
continuously supplied, the continuous type electrolyzed water
producing apparatus is superior to the batch type one. However,
if electrolyzed strongly acidic water or electrolyzed strongly
alkaline water is intended to be continuously produced using the
continuous type electrolyzed water producing apparatus, a large
number of electrode plates are required from the relationship
between the flow rate and the area of the electrode plate. This
causes a disadvantage of an increased cost for the electrolyzed
water producing apparatus.In the continuous type electrolyzed water producing
apparatus, the internal pressure in the electrolytic cell is
increased. Therefore, in order to withstand such an internal
pressure, the seal structure for the electrolytic
