<ABSTRACT>
A circuit and method for compressing or generating a pulse, particularly a chirp pulse, which uses infinite impulse response filtering (3.2). The infinite impulse response filters (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12) simulate the response of finite impulse response filters. This is achieved by pre-processing the signal by passing it through a pre-processing filter (3.3) which has zero response at the resonant frequencies of the infinite impulse response filters (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12). The pre-processing and infinite impulse response filtering may be incorporated into a matched filter for detection of a chirp waveform input signal. This can be implemented in the time domain or the frequency domain. The matched filter also can incorporate beating to the base band techniques. The matched filter can also act as a generator by applying a pulse to the input which has the unit impulse function causing a chirp signal, equivalent to the transfer function of the filter, to be produced at the output.

<DESCRIPTION>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PULSE COMPRESSION AND PULSE GENERATIONThe present invention relates to pulse compression and pulse generation, in particular for compression or generation of chirp pulses.Pulse compression and generation are most commonly used in active sonar and radar applications. Active sonar or radar are used for the purpose of detection of objects by the emission of pulses and monitoring the return of the pulse reflections. It is not known at what point in time the reflected pulse will return and therefore it is necessary to monitor the return signal over the period of time in which the pulse is likely to return. The return signal also contains other elements. These are caused by background noise (marine and electrical), biological noise, mechanical noise and clutter. It is therefore necessary to identify the pulse reflection amongst these. Conventionally, this has been done by one of two methods; simple detection or matched filtering (correlation) .Correlation can be implemented in a number of ways but is computationally expensive operation and its achievement in real time requires a high degree of processing power and demands state of the art, thus expensive, technology.This produces a filter which is a matched to a particular pulse and is known as a matched filter. A filter is said to be matched to a pulse when the transfer function (F[-t]) is the time reversed function of the pulse (F[t]). The output is said to be the compressed pulse. The width 

 of the compressed pulse is proportional to the inverse of the bandwidth of the pulse and the amplitude is proportional to the duration of the pulse. If a pulse with the unit impulse function is applied to a matched filter input, a pulse, which has a function equivalent to the transfer function of the matched filter will be produced. In this way the matched filter can be used as a signal generator.Hatched filtering can be implemented in two ways, in the frequency domain or in the time domain. In the frequency domain it is implemented by digitizing the signal and then using Fast Fourier transform algorithms which, although efficient, require large amounts of computation for large BT products. Often compromise methods are used which give inaccurate results. In the time domain it is implemented using time delays, finite impulse response [FIR] filters and summation. It can be implemented using analogue techniques which requires a large amount of hardware or by digital algorithms which require large amounts of computation.There are two major
