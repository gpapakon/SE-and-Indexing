<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for providing a novel dynamic developer bias 
control system adapted to determine an optimal developer bias 

during the processing of the lead edge of an input document. 
Loss of image density for images on the lead edge of a document 

is minimized by varying the developer bias relative to 
variations in an optical sensor voltage signal. In addition, 

background development in the body of the copy sheet is further 
prevented by maintaining a developer bias at an elevated level 

in response to a determination that the lamp voltage exceeds a 
maximum level and the optical sensor signal is less than a 

predetermined target value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrostatographic printing
apparatus and to a method for dynamically controlling developer bias.From EP-A-0 117 533 according to the precharacterizing parts of claims 1 and 2, an
electrostatographic printing apparatus is known for producing a copy of an original
document, comprising an imaging system for transmitting a light image of the original
document to an imaging member to produce a latent image thereof, wherein said
imaging system includes an optical sensor for sensing the intensity of the transmitted
light image. A developing system includes a developer electrode for developing said
latent image. Furthermore, said apparatus comprises means for applying an electrical
bias to said developing electrode to generate electric fields between said imaging
member and said developer electrode. The apparatus further comprises means coupled
to said biasing applying means for dynamically changing the electric bias applied to said
developer electrode in response to said sensed optical intensity of the transmitted light
image.It is an object of the invention to minimize loss of images on the lead edge of a dark background original.
This object is solved by the features of claims 1 and 2.According to the invention, a controlling means is adapted in response to a determination
that said instantaneous optical intensity is less than or equal to said first average optical
intensity for setting the developer bias is set in accordance with the following equation:
NBIAS.DOC = (NBIAS.GOLD - 300)(AE.WHITE - AE.GOLD) × (AE.WHITE - AE.DOC) + 300
where:
NBIAS.DOC represents said selected voltage for said developer bias;NBIAS.GOLD represents the electrical bias required to be applied to
said developer to suppress background development of the input
document having the second background color; AE. WHITE represents said first average optical intensity;AE. GOLD represents said second average optical intensity; andAE. DOC represents said instantaneous optical intensity for light reflected
from an original input document to be printed.All biases are expressed in volts. The present invention will become
apparent from the following description in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings in which:
FIG. 1 is a flowchart depicting a sequence of operating
steps for dynamic developer bias control as provided by the
present invention; FIG. 2 is a graphic representation of a voltage signal
from an optical sensor with respect to time during the processing
of the lead edge of a copy sheet; FIG. 3 is
