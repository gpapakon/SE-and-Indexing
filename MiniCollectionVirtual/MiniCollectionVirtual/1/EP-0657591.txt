<ABSTRACT>
A medical herb infusion dispenser comprises an outer 
enclosure assembly 1 containing a herb container 21 and 

including a concentrator tube 12 positioned at the top of the 
enclosure, a faucet connector tube 13 extending through the 

concentrator tube 12, and upper and lower separator plates 14 
and 15 between which the herb container 21 is positioned in 

use. The assembly is connected to a faucet by the faucet 
connector tube 13 and is suspended from the faucet while hot 

water flows through the faucet connector tube 13, through a 
perforated core tube 22 extending between the separator plates 

14 and 15 and through the herb container 21 prior to passing 
through an outlet hole at the bottom of the enclosure. Such 

a dispenser is of simple construction, and is easy and 
economical to use.

<DESCRIPTION>
As standards of living increase, the healthful effects of 
bathing, specifically the physically invigorating aspects of 
hygienic cleanliness, have led to the direct utilization of 
medicinal herbs chiefly in the form of herbal infusions. The 
aforesaid herbal infusion refers to the placing of medicinal herb 
ingredients into the bath water to improve the physical health of 
the human body. All herbal formulas are not the same and different 
ingredients are utilized for specific symptoms. The mineral bath 
is perhaps the more commonly observed form of medicinal bath, but 
there has been a recent interest in herbal baths, of which the 
invention herein offers an excellent preferred embodiment which 
shall be described in full detail. At present, the tea bath is mainly utilized in tea production 
regions since there is an abundant supply of tea to infuse a strong 
infusion. However, this approach is not convenient or economical. In 
view of this, the inventor herein has conceived the idea of adopting 
the principles of a medicinal tea bag to provide a practical 
alternative that can be utilized in the home, and this is among the 
major objectives of the invention herein.  To enable a thorough understanding of the aforementioned 
structural and technological aspects of the invention herein by the 
examining officials, the following brief description of the drawings 
and detailed description of the invention here are provided. Figure 1 is an isometric drawing of the invention herein. Figure 2 is an exploded isometric drawing of the invention 
herein. Figure 3 is a cross-sectional drawing of the faucet connector
