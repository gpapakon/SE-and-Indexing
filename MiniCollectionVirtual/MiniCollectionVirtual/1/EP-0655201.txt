<ABSTRACT>
A method for the treatment of agricultural produce 
by generating a relatively dry fog of at least 95% humidity 

having an average particle size of less than 20 microns, 
preferably about 5 microns, and applying the fog to the 

produce. The fog may be applied during the storage of the 
produce for a period of at least several weeks, whereupon 

the treatment substantially reduces weight loss and decay 
during the storage period. The fog may include a fungicide, 

whereupon the treatment substantially reduces 
fungus-produced decay.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment of 
agricultural produce, namely fruit, vegetables and flowers, 
and particularly to a treatment for reducing weight loss 
and/or decay until the produce reaches the consumer. Weight loss and decay caused by pathogens are two 
main problems involved in the storage of certain types of 
produce. For example, in the case of sweet potatoes, weight 
loss after six months storage at a relative humidity (RH) of 
50-60% can reach up to 50%; and the decay can reach up to 
83% in 1.5 months storage. Increasing the humidity and 
adding a fungicide reduces the weight loss and decay. For 
example storing these products at relatively high humidity, 
e.g., 85-90% (RH), and at temperatures of about 10Â°C reduces 
the weight loss to about 15% during six months storage, and 
adding a fungicide reduces decay to about 13% after 1.5 
months. However, when the relative humidity increases to 
more than 90%, free water (condensation) starts to be 
concentrated on surfaces of the produce and cause dry rot 
diseases to develop. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
method for treating such produce to further reduce weight 
loss and decay during storage. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a method for the treatment of agricultural produce 
comprising: generating a relatively dry fog of at least 95% 
humidity having an average particle size of less than 20 
microns, preferably about 5 microns, and applying the fog to 
the produce. According to a further feature in the described 
preferred embodiments, the generated fog includes a 
fungicide. It has been found that using such a fog enables 
the humidity to be substantially increased without causing 
the condensation of free water on the produce surface, such 
that the treatment substantially reduces weight loss and  
 
also decay, and further reduces the quantity of fungicide 
needed. For example, whereas in the conventional 
humidifying technique as applied to sweet potatoes, weight 
loss during a six months storge period was 15%, it was 
reduced to 6% when using the fog of the present invention; 
and whereas the amount of fungicide required was such as to 
produce a residue of about 2-3 ppm, this was reduced to an 
amount which produced a residue of about 0.09 ppm. Similar 
results were produced in the storage of melons, but here the 
fungicide was even further reduced from a residue of 
3-5 ppm, to about 0.05 ppm. It will be appreciated that 
this substantial reduction in the amount of fungicide in
