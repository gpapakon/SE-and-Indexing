<ABSTRACT>
A child safety seat for use in a vehicle, 
comprising a seat body (10), and two S-shaped coupling arms 

(36, 38), each of which is pivotally mounted at one end 
(46, 48) to the seat body (10) below the front thereof and 

has a front releasable fastener (58, 60) on its other end 
(54, 56) for attachment to a front anchorage unit located 

below the front edge of a vehicle seat (18). The coupling 
arm (36, 38) is so shaped that an intermediate portion (40, 

42) thereof is located in front of both ends (46, 48; 54, 
56) thereof when the front releasable fastener (58, 60) is 

engaged with the front anchorage unit, so as to extent 
round the front edge of the vehicle seat (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child safety seat for 
use in a vehicle, of the type comprising a seat body and 
releasable coupling means for securing the seat body to the 
vehicle. The disadvantage of mounting a child seat in a 
vehicle by resting it on a vehicle seat and securing it in 
place with straps arises from the inherent resilience of 
the springs and upholstery of the vehicle seat and also 
from the resilience of the straps themselves. Even if the 
straps securing the child seat are pulled very tight during 
installation, such resilience will permit undesirable 
movement of the child seat relative to the vehicle in event 
of sudden deceleration, for example during an accident. In 
order to overcome this disadvantage, it has been proposed 
to provide motor cars with standard anchorage units at 
agreed locations for engagement by releasable connectors 
which are rigidly coupled to a child seat. Proposals under 
discussion at the present time involve the location of at 
least one such standard anchorage unit below the front edge 
of the vehicle seat and close to the floor of the vehicle. 
The present invention is concerned with the provision of a 
child seat of the type described above for attachment to 
such anchorage units. According to the invention, in a child safety seat 
of the type described above, the releasable coupling means 
includes a coupling arm pivotally mounted at one end to the 
seat body below the front thereof and having a front 
releasable fastener on its other end for attachment to a 
front anchorage unit located below the front edge of a 
vehicle seat, the coupling arm being so shaped that an 
intermediate portion thereof is located in front of both 
ends thereof when the front releasable fastener is engaged 
with the front anchorage unit. The coupling arm may be S-shaped. It should be understood that reference to the 
front of the child seat means the front of the seat in 
relation to the direction of travel of the vehicle. If the 
invention is applied to a rearward facing child seat, the  
 
coupling arm would be attached to the seat body in the 
region of the backrest thereof. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic side view of a child seat 
in accordance with the invention fitted to a vehicle seat; Figure 2 is a perspective view of the child seat 
with its support member in the orientation shown in Figure 
1; Figure 3 is a scrap view of a standard anchorage

<CLAIMS>
A child safety seat for use in a vehicle, 
comprising a seat body (10) and releasable coupling means 

for securing the seat body to the vehicle, characterised in 
that the releasable coupling means includes a coupling arm 

(36, 38) pivotally mounted at one end (46, 48) to the seat 
body (10) below the front thereof and having a front 

releasable fastener (58, 60) on its other end (54, 56) for 
attachment to a front anchorage unit located below the 

front edge of a vehicle seat (18), the coupling arm (36, 
38) being so shaped that an intermediate portion (40, 42) 

thereof is located in front of both ends (46, 48; 54, 56) 
thereof when the front releasable fastener (58, 60) is 

engaged with the front anchorage unit. 
A child safety seat according to claim 1, wherein 
the releasable coupling means further comprises a rear 

releasable fastener (20, 22) projecting from the rear of 
the seat body (10) for attachment to a rear anchorage unit 

located at the bottom of the backrest (24) of said vehicle 
seat, the rear releasable fastener having manually operable 

release means (26) operation of which is obstructed by the 
coupling arm (36, 38) when the front releasable fastener is 

engaged with the front anchorage unit. 
A child safety seat according to claim 1, wherein 
the coupling arm (36, 38) is arranged to obstruct occupancy 

of the child seat when pivoted away from its engaged 
position. 
A child safety seat according to any preceding 
claim, wherein the coupling arm (36, 38) is S-shaped.
