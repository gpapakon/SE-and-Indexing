<ABSTRACT>
The roof panel is made of flexible material and is stretched over cross struts (6,7) guided on tracks along the sides of the roof opening. Some of the cross struts are released from the track to form folds outside the roof profile, with the folds formed from the rear of the roof. To secure the roof in the closed position flexible ties (13) are threaded through elastic support under the roof edges and these ties are tightened when the roof is closed. The ties are guided through blocks (18) on the tracks and are released by a release slider operating at the rear of the roof opening. Alternatively a sliding clasp fastener can be fitted on each side, with a release element positioned on the side tracks to open and close the fastener.

A folding roof (1) for vehicles with a hood (4), with an
alternating sequence of fold supports (6), adapted to be

pivoted by means of push-out levers (9) to open the hood
(4), and with intermediate struts (7) which cooperate at

least partially on both sides with longitudinal guides (5)
for optionally closing or at least partially opening a roof

aperture (3) provided in a fixed roof area (2),
characterised in that at least the closed part of the hood

(4) is on both sides rigidly connected to the roof and is
held don at a distance from the longitudinal guides (5) in

the direction of the longitudinal edges (10) of the hood
(4) via a separable connecting device (11, 11') which forms

an additional lateral fastening.
A folding roof according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the connecting device (11, 11') is, under positive control,

separable in the rear part of the longitudinal guides (5).
A folding roof according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the separable connecting device (11) is constituted by

a fastening cable (13) extending within a fastening cable
guide channel (19), said cable being connected at both ends

on the longitudinal sides to the hood (4) via a flexible
material (17).
A folding roof according to Claim 2, characterised in that
for positively controlled detachment, an insertion piece

(18) is provided which exposes the fastening cable guide
channel (19) in the direction of the hood (4).
A folding roof according to Claim 4, characterised in that
in the opening area of the insertion piece (18) guides are 

provided to facilitate insertion and emergence of the
fastening cable (13).
A folding roof according to one of Claims 3 to 5,
characterised in that each fastening cable (13) is rigidly

connected to the hood (4) at the longitudinal ends.
A folding roof according to one of Claims 3 to 6,
characterised in that the fastening cable (13) accompanies

the movement of the hood (4) during opening and closing.
A folding roof according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the separable connecting device (11') is constituted

by a sliding clasp fastener (22).
A folding roof according to Claim 8, characterised in that
for positively controlled separation of the sliding clasp

fastener (22), an opening and closing part (23) cooperates
with the sliding clasp fastener links.
A folding roof according to Claim 9, characterised in that
in the vicinity of the opening and closing part (23) there

are guides for the sliding clasp fastener links.
A folding roof according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the intermediate struts (7) are

guided for longitudinal movement in the longitudinal guides
(5) via sliding members (8).
A folding roof according to Claim 7 and Claim 11,
characterised in that the fastening cable (13) is for

entrainment connected to the sliding member (8) via a
bridge (14). 
A folding roof according to Claim 11 or 12, characterised
in that the fold struts (6) are articulatingly connected to

the respective sliding member (8) via a push-out lever (9).
A folding roof according to Claim 13, characterised in that
the articulating connection is a film hinge (21).
A folding roof according to one of Claims 11 to 14,
characterised in that a drive cable (15) transports at

least the sliding member (8) in the longitudinal guides
(5).
A folding roof according to one of Claims 11 to 15,
characterised in that the hood (4) is held down at least at

one intermediate strut (7).
A folding roof according to Claim 16, characterised in that
a spring (16; 16') is provided to perform the holding-down

function.
A folding roof according to Claim 3 and 15, characterised
in that the drive cable guide channel (20) and the

fastening cable guide channel (19) are, apart from the
insertion piece (18), provided in a common longitudinal

guide (5).
A folding roof according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that each longitudinal guide (5) is

constituted by a guide rail.
