<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat developable
color light-sensitive material, specifically to a heat
developable color light-sensitive material which provides an
excellent discrimination of an image and is less susceptible to
an influence by a fluctuation in a development processing
condition.A heat developable color light-sensitive material is
publicly known in this technical field, and the heat
developable color light-sensitive material and the process
thereof are described in, for example, " Base of A Photography"
a non-silver salt photography series (published by Corona Co.,
Ltd., 1982), pp. 242 to 255, and U.S. Patent 4,500,626.In addition to the above, a process by which a dye
image is formed, for example, by a reaction of an oxidation
product of a developing agent with a coupler is described in
U.S. Patents 3,761,270 and 4,021,240. Further, a process by
which a positive color image is formed according to a light-sensitive
silver dye-bleaching process is described in U.S.
Patent 4,235,957.In recent years, there is proposed a process by which
a diffusible dye is imagewise released or formed by a heat
development and this diffusible dye is transferred on a dye-fixing 
element. In this process, the kind of a dye-providing
compound used or the kind of silver halide used can be changed
to change either a dye image in a negative or a dye image in a
positive. More details are described in U.S. Patents 4,500,626,
4,483,914, 4,503,137, and 4,559,290, JP-A-58-1449046 (the term
"JP-A" as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese
patent application), JP-A-60-133449, JP-A-59-218443, and JP-A-61-238056,
European Patent Publication 220746A2, Published
Technical Report 87-6199, and European Patent Publication
210660A2.Many processes are proposed as well regarding a process
by which a positive color image by a heat development is
obtained. There is proposed in U.S. Patent 4,559,290, for
example, a process in which a compound obtained by converting
a so-called DDR compound to an oxidation type having no dye-releasing
ability is allowed to coexist with a reducing agent
of the precursor thereof, the reducing agent is oxidized by a
heat development according to an exposure of silver halide and
a diffusible dye is released by reducing with the reducing
agent remained without being oxidized. Further, there is
described in European Patent Publication 220746A and Published
Technical Report 87-6199 (vol. 12, No. 22), a heat developable
color light-sensitive material using a compound releasing a
diffusible
