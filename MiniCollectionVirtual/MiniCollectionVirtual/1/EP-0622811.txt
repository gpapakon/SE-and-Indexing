<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nuclear batteries and is
particularly concerned with a nuclear powered battery
formed by incorporating tritium within an amorphous
semiconductor material, such as amorphous silicon with or
without dopants.The word battery, as used in this context, pertains to one
or a connected set of similar units or cells acting as an
electrical energy source. A nuclear battery, also known as
an atomic battery, refers to a battery in which the source
of energy is the energy stored in the nucleus of the atoms
of the fuel. The nuclear energy stored in the nucleus is
typically released in one of three ways: fission of the
nucleus, fusion of the nucleus, or radioactive decay of the
nucleus. Nuclear batteries according to the present
invention rely on radioactive decay of nuclei and convert
to electrical energy the liberated nuclear radiation (beta
particles). Over the last several decades a number of nuclear batteries
of the kind relying on nuclear radioactive decay have been
developed on the basis of a single conversion process or a
double conversion process. Single conversion nuclear
batteries directly convert nuclear radiation into
electrical energy. Double conversion nuclear batteries
convert nuclear radiation energy into an intermediate form
of energy which in turn is converted into electrical
energy.Nuclear batteries of the single conversion type include
betavoltaic batteries, wherein a semiconductor p-n junction
is exposed to nuclear radiation which results in the
production of electron-hole pairs and thus an induced
current at low voltage. An example is afforded in U.S.
Patents Nos. 2,745,973 and 4,024,420. Another example of
single conversion process nuclear batteries is a low
voltage battery that uses the principle of gas ionization,
wherein the battery consists of an ionization gas, two
different electrodes which establish an electric field in
the gas space, and a nuclear radiation source which is
either gaseous or solid in form. Still another example is
afforded by a high voltage, vacuum battery in which one
electrode forms the source of charged particle nuclear
radiation while the other electrode is chosen to have low
secondary emission and high collection efficiency, thus
resulting in a high voltage, low current device. Nuclear batteries of the double conversion process type
include photovoltaic batteries (in which the nuclear
radiation energy is first converted into electromagnetic
radiation, typically by irradiating a phosphorescent
material and then exposing a semiconductor p-n
