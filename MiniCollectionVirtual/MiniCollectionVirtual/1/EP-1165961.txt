<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention the end faces (20, 30) of two axially adjacent injector modules (1, 5) of a fuel injector, which faces are pressed against each other in pairs, are subjected to a surface pressure which creates a high-pressure seal both between the high-pressure ports, situated in the injector modules, and of said ports towards the exterior. The end face (20, 30) is divided into a first and a second partial area (20, 30), the second partial area (30) being recessed in relation to the first partial area (20) by an axial depth (h). The first partial area (20) serves as a sealing area so that when the surface pressure is increased by application of a defined axial preloading force a very tight seal is obtained.

<CLAIMS>
Fuel injection valve with injector modules (1, 5, 6, 7, 8),

in each of which a high-pressure orifice (3) and an inlet channel (9) is
provided,
that are arranged axially relative to each other and axially pre-tensioned
with a pre-tensioning means
 (10) so that both mating surfaces of two
superimposed injector modules (1, 5, 6, 7, 8) form sealing faces by

means of a high surface pressure, whereby at least one end face (20, 30)
is divided into a first and a second joint face (20, 30), with the second

joint face (30) being recessed by an axial depth (h) relative to the first
joint face (20) in the direction of the injector module (1, 5, 6, 7, 8)

having the end face (20, 30), and the first joint face (20) being subjected
to a greater surface pressure than the second joint face (30) by the pre-tensioning

of the injector modules (1, 5, 6, 7, 8), 
characterised in that
the second joint face (30) is connected to a return channel provided in
the injector module (1, 5, 6, 7, 8),
the first joint face (20) serves as a sealing face and the second joint face
(30) as a drainage surface to drain off any fuel leakage through the return

channel (2).
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
the first joint face (20) is flat.
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
the second joint face (30) has an unevenness as required.
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
the openings of the high-pressure orifice (3) and of the inlet channel (9)
are arranged in the first joint face (20).
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
the opening of the return channel (2) is arranged in the second joint face
(30).
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the first joint face (20) is further subdivided into the
following joint face subdivisions (21, 22, 25) that lie in the plane of the first

joint face:

a circular first sealing face (21), in the centre of which the opening of the
high-pressure orifice (3) is arranged, with a first circle width (b1),
a circular second sealing face (22), in the centre of which the opening of
the inlet channel (9) is arranged, with a second circle width (b2),
a circular fourth sealing face (25), the outer rim of which connects to the
surface of the body of the injector module (1, 5, 6, 7, 8), with a fourth

circle width (b4).
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
the first joint face (20) has a third sealing face (24) as a further joint face
subdivision (24), in the centre of which the opening of a further channel

(4) is arranged, with a third circle width (b3).
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
the first, second, third and fourth circle widths (b1, b2, b3, b4) each have
a width of at least 1 mm.
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding Claims 1 to 4

characterised in that
the first joint face (20) is further subdivided by the second joint face (30)
into a first and second joint face subdivision (26, 27), whereby the

second joint face (30) is preferably formed as a complete annular groove
(31) in the first joint face (20), that includes the openings of the high-pressure

orifice (3) and of the inlet channel (9),
the opening of the return channel (2) is arranged in the first joint face
subdivision (26),
the openings of the high-pressure orifice (3) and of the inlet channel (9)
are arranged in the second joint face subdivision (27),
the opening of the return channel (2) touches at least partially on the wall
of the groove (31) so that any fuel leakage can drain away through the

groove (31) into the return channel (2).
Fuel injection valve according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
the opening of a further channel (4) is arranged in the first joint face
subdivision (26).
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
one of the two mating end faces (20, 30) of two superimposed injector
modules (1, 5, 6, 7, 8) in each case is formed only as a single-surface

face lying in one plane.
Fuel injection valve according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in
that
both of the two mating end faces (20, 30) of two superimposed injector
modules (1, 5, 6, 7, 8) each have a second joint face (30) that overlap

each other as a mirror image.
Fuel injection valve according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
the axial height difference, referred to as the axial depth (h), between the
first joint face (20) and second joint face (30) is between 10 µm and 50

µm.
Fuel injection valve according to one of Claims 6 to 12, 
characterised in
that
the angle between the longitudinal axis of two superimposed injector
modules is the module angle, 
where there is an unsatisfactory distribution of the joint face subdivisions
(21, 22, 25) on the end face at least one compensating face is provided in

the plane of the first joint face (20), so that the deviation of the module
angle from 180° can be set relative to the area centre of gravity and to

the area of the compensating face and thus to a negligibly small value,
preferably to 0°.
