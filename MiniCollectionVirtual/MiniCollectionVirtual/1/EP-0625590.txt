<ABSTRACT>
Addition polymer substrates comprising 
structural groups derived from olefinic nitriles and 

conjugated dienes, especially ABS resin substrates, are 
treated with aqueous tetravalent cerium in a concentration 

of at least about 0.1 
M
, preferably with a tetravalent 
cerium solution, to improve adhesion to metal coatings 

subsequently deposited non-electrolytically; for example, 
by electroless deposition. The metallized articles are heat 

treated following metal deposition. Further metal coatings 
may be deposited, preferably followed by further heat 

treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the metallization of 
plastic surfaces, and more particularly to a metallization 
method useful with thermoplastic addition polymers. Metallized plastics have become of interest in 
recent years as a replacement for metal in such articles as 
automobiles, enclosures for electrical appliances, 
microwave ovens, business machines and the like. When 
fabricated of plastics alone, such enclosures are inadequate 
to shield internal parts from external radiation sources 
such as electromagnetic interference, particularly radio 
frequency interference, and static electricity, and also to 
prevent escape of internally generated radiation. Such 
sources of interference can be blocked out by providing a 
metal coating on the surface of the plastic substrate, 
typically by electroless or electrolytic deposition. 
Metallization is also desirable for the formation of printed 
circuit boards, whereupon the entire surface or a portion 
thereof is metallized and is then masked and etched in 
areas where metal traces are not desired. With the development of relatively mild 
processing methods such as laser soldering, it has become 
possible to fabricate articles such as printed circuit boards 
from plastic materials having lower degrees of heat 
resistance than formerly. Examples of such materials are 
addition polymers comprising structural units derived from 
olefinic nitriles and conjugated dienes. They include 
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resins, hereinafter 
sometimes designated "ABS resins". Metallized ABS resins 
and the like are of particular use in various decorative 
applications.  
 One of the most serious problems which arise in 
the metallization of plastics is the lack of adhesion of the 
metal layer to the substrate. Various methods for 
improving adhesion of metal layers to the surfaces of ABS 
resin substrates are known. Early methods involved treatment with chromic 
acid, which severely etched the resin surface and often 
caused a decrease in impact strength. Other effects of 
residual traces of chromium chemicals on a resin surface 
included inactivation of electroless plating catalysts; 
therefore, it was absolutely necessary to employ effective 
rinsing steps to remove all the chromium. In any event, 
chromic acid treatment is no longer possible because of the 
environmental hazards presented by the resulting sludge. 
Other methods, such as those described in U.S. Patents 
3,847,648 and 5,160,600, employ palladium, an expensive 
material, in combination with various
