<ABSTRACT>
A monitoring system for replaceable units, such as toner cartridges in an 
electrophotographic apparatus, includes on the unit an electronic count memory (112) and an 

electronic flag memory (114). The count memory maintains a one-by-one count of prints made 
with the cartridge. The flag memory includes a series of bits (116) which are alterable from a 

first state to a second state but not alterable from the second state to the first state. The bits in 
the flag memory are altered at predetermined intervals as prints are made with the cartridge. 

The flag memory is used as a check to override unauthorized manipulation of the count 
memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrophotographic reproducing machines, and
more particularly to a monitoring system for the use of one or more replaceable cartridges in
such a reproducing machine.Recently, electrophotographic reproducing machines have been developed which
use one or more replaceable subassembly units, familiarly termed cartridges. One typical
cartridge comprises a toner supply and the necessary supporting hardware therefor assembled
in a single unit designed for insertion and removal into and out of the machine. When the
cartridge is used up, the old cartridge is removed and a new one substituted. Other replaceable
cartridges including developer cartridges, photoreceptor cartridges, etc., may also be
envisioned for this purpose.However, where the cartridge also serves as the vehicle for billing the customer for
the number of prints or copies made, it becomes important that the cartridge not only reliably
provide all the copies for which the customer has paid, but also that there be a reliable and fail
safe way to control and monitor the cartridge's use. The customer should get exactly the
number of prints guaranteed for the cartridge. If less, the manufacturer should make up the
difference free of charge.Also, the customer should get no more than the print number warranted. But since
any customer would obviously find it advantageous to obtain more prints than he is supposed
to get and can probably be expected to try to use the cartridge beyond the warranty stage, it is
also important to the manufacturer to make sure, once all of the prints have been made and
the cartridge is exhausted, that the cartridge is disabled and that no further prints can be made
by the cartridge. Further, it is highly desirable that the customer be given a warning when the
cartridge is close to the end of its life so that there is time for the customer to obtain a fresh
cartridge before the old cartridge is used up.US-A-4,551,000 discloses a replaceable "process kit" for an image-forming apparatus,
such as a copier or printer, which includes apparatus for indicating when the useful life of the
process kit is about to expire and when it has expired.US-A-4,961,088 discloses a system for monitoring replaceable cartridges in printers or
copiers. Each replaceable cartridge includes an EEPROM (Electrically Eraseable Programable
Read Only Memory). The EEPROM associated with each cartridge may be programmed with an
identification number and means for retaining a count of prints or copies made with the unit.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A replaceable unit (12, 14, 16) for producing an output of a predetermined number of
prints in a reproducing apparatus, the unit comprising:


a housing (25, 52, 64);
a component (20) retained in the housing (25, 52, 64) and operable to produce the output;
and
memory means (90, 112, 114, 116, 118) permanently mounted in the housing (25, 52, 64)
for logging the number of prints made in the apparatus,

   characterized in that the memory means (90, 112, 114, 116, 118) comprises at least a first
memory (112) adapted to retain counting data relating to the cumulative output of the unit (12, 14,

16); and a second memory (114) having a plurality of flags (116) associated therewith, each flag
(116) being irreversibly alterable from a first state 1 to a second state 0 in accordance with the

cumulative output of the unit (12, 14, 16), the second memory (114) being associated with the first
memory (112) to ensure that the first memory (112) contains substantially the same cumulative

output.
A unit as claimed in claim 1, further comprising an integrated circuit which includes
the first memory (112) and the second memory (114).
A unit as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the first memory (112) comprises an
EEPROM.
A unit as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further comprising a third
memory (118) adapted to retain a number related to a relationship between the cumulative output of

the unit (12, 14, 16) and the number of flags (116) initially in the first state (1) in the second memory
(114).
A monitoring system (100) for a replaceable unit (12, 14, 16) as claimed in any one
of the preceding claims, the system including:


means for altering one flag (116) in the second memory (114) from the first state (1) to the
second state (0) in response to a predetermined cumulative output of the unit (12, 14, 16); and
means for comparing counting data in the first memory (114) and the number of flags (116)
in a predetermined state in the second memory (114).
A monitoring system as claimed in claim 5, further comprising means for revising the
counting data in the first memory (112) to be consistent with the number of flags (116) in a

predetermined state in the second memory (114). 
A method of monitoring the cumulative use of a replaceable unit (12, 14, 16) as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, the method comprising the steps of:


changing a number stored in the first memory (112) in accordance with the number of prints
outputted; and
altering one flag (116) in the second memory (114) from a first state (1) to a second state (0)
when the predetermined number of prints are outputted.
A method as claimed in claim 7, further comprising the step of comparing the
number in the first memory (112) with the number of flags (116) in a predetermined state (1) in the

second memory (114).
A method as claimed in claim 8, further comprising the step of revising the number
stored in the first memory (112) to be consistent with the number of flags (116) in the predetermined

state (1) in the second memory (114).
