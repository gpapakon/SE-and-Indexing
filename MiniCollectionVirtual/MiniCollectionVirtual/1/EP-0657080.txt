<ABSTRACT>
In an Enhanced Definition Television (EDTV) system disclosed here, an assistance signal is transmitted to enable a suitably equipped receiver (105) to choose from a number of predetermined deinterlacin modes. The modes represent interpolation options for estimating lines missing in a current interlaced image field, thereby enhancing the vertical resolution of a display. For example, five options may provide for as follows: (1) intra-frame linear interpolation, (2) use of information from a preceding frame, (3) use of information from a succeeding frame, (4) combining the results of (1) and (2) and (5) combining the results of (1) and (3). Preferably, interpolation options are derived on a block basis and transmitted with coded motion vectors which may be compressed to make maximum use of the available bandwidth. The assistance signal may be transmitted within the vertical and/or horizontal blanking intervals of an interlaced television broadcast.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of assistance
signals for improved image resolution in Enhanced
Definition Television (EDTV).Current U.S. television broadcast signals conform
with a standard formulated by the National Television
System Committee (NTSC), providing for 525 horizontal
scan lines, a 4-to-3 screen aspect ratio, and
allocation of a bandwidth of 6 megahertz per
communications channel. This standard further calls
for alternating transmission of the odd-numbered and
the even-numbered scan lines.As compared, e.g., with 35-mm motion-picture
images, transmissions based on the NTSC standard
produce images with less resolution of detail and a
less appealing aspect ratio, and similar observations
apply to a different standard for conventional
resolution television known as PAL (Phase Alternation
Line) in use elsewhere. In view of these shortcomings,
and to improve upon current television image quality,
there have been proposals for a new standard for so-called
high-definition television (HDTV) with greater
vertical and horizontal resolution. Practicable
proposed systems are incompatible with reception by
receivers in current use. As an alternative, systems
have been proposed which retain compatibility with
current receiver standards and which use an auxiliary,
low-bandwidth channel of assistance information to help
improve upon the quality of present-day broadcasts.
Though sometimes also referred to as HDTV in the 
literature, such systems are more appropriately
referred to as enhanced-definition TV (EDTV), and they
may be considered as an interim to the introduction of
HDTV.The following are cited as background in the field
of HDTV/EDTV:U.S. Patent 4,916,525, issued April 10, 1990 to
J.E. Drummond discloses a system in which compressed
vertical resolution-enhancing image data is transmitted
during the vertical flyback interval of an NTSC
television signal. An appropriately equipped receiver
can decompress the compressed image data and add the
expanded lines of data to the normal image data of the
NTSC signal in interlinear fashion. In a receiver not
so equipped, the added data is simply ignored.U.S. Patent 4,967,263, issued October 30, 1990 to
