<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a segmented chimney (1), and in particular to a chimney constructed from separate inflated chimney units (3) mounted one on top of another, and to the chimney units therefor. Each chimney unit has a segmented side wall, the segments (12) being individually movable relative to the unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CHIMNEYFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a chimney, and in particular to a chimney constructed from separate chimney units, and to the chimney units therefor.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONChimneys are used in a variety of locations, and for a variety of applications. In particular, they may be used with a solar heat collector, the chimney containing one or more turbines to generate (electrical) power from the uprushing, solar heated, air or other gas. Alternatively, they may be used for other types of power generation, or with desalination plants and/or as emission and exhaust devices.Traditionally, chimneys have been constucted of brick, concrete, steel or other reinforced or substantially rigid materials. Rigid construction methods are also used. These chimneys are expensive to construct and to maintain, and, due to the difficulty of supporting the weight of the chimney, are also limited in the height to which they can be built. Additionally, the problems of wind resistance 

and aerodynamic stability in the event of strong lateral winds limit the height of such chimneys.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTIn order to facilitate easier on-site construction, it has been proposed to construct chimneys from pre-fabricated chimney sections or units. One known design is that of French patent 2,079,479, which discloses a chimney made up of standard units mounted one upon another. The units are individually rigid.As a means to reduce the weight of an erected chimney, U.S. patent 3,974,756 teaches a chimney constucted from individual chimney units, wherein each of the units is of flexible lightweight material. The assembled chimney is held erected by a balloon.A lightweight chimney is disclosed in German patent 280,351, wherein the chimney is inflatable. The chimney disclosed in this patent has vertical partitions dividing the chimney into separate vertical sections.However, whilst these known chimney arrangements seek to offer an easily constructed and/or lightweight chimney, so that in theory a very tall chimney could be constructed, these chimneys are substantially rigid, and suffer 

significant resistance to lateral impacting winds. This is a recognised disadvantage for those applications, such as solar collector chimneys, which would benefit from using a very tall chimney. The substantially rigid form of known chimneys leads directly to an upper limit on the useful height of such chimneys.STATEMENT OF THE INVENTIONIt is the object of the present invention provide a chimney which avoids or reduces

CLAIMS
1. A chimney (1) formed from separate chimney units (3) mounted one on top of another, characterised in that each chimney unit (3) has an upstanding wall comprising separate segments (12), the segments being individually movable relative to the unit.
2. A chimney according to claim 1 characterised in that the segments are mounted to flex resiliently inwardly of the unit whereby to deflect a lateral impacting wind upwards towards the mouth of the chimney.
3. A chimney according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which the lowermost unit is located upon a rigid mount (2).
4. A chimney according to any of claims 1-3 in which tethering means (6) secure the chimney against substantial lateral movement.
5. A chimney according to claim 4 in which the segments are inflated, in which a securing ring (4) is located upon the topmost chimney unit, and in which tethering means (5) connect the securing ring to the ground.
6. A chimney according to any of claims 1-3 in which the chimney units are interconnected by expandable connection means. 


7. A chimney according to any of claims 1-6 in which each chimney unit has an annular tubular base (10) with a continuous lip (11) depending therefrom.
8. A chimney according to any of claims 1-7 in which each chimney unit has an inflation valve inlet, each inflation valve inlet being connected to one end of a respective inflation tube, the other end of each respective inflation tube being connected to inflation means adjacent ground level.
9. A chimney according to any of claims 1-8 in which each chimney unit is partitioned into a plurality of separate inflation regions.
10. A chimney unit for use in a chimney according to any of claims 1-9.
