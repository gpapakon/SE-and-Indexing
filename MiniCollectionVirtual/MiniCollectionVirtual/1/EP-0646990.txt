<ABSTRACT>
An electrical power socket system consists of a plug (or male connector element) (1) and a socket or female connector element (2), the said female connector element (2) comprising a closure means (3) brought back into the closed position in front of its orifices (40, 20) which renders the said connector element inoperative by closing off its orifices by a return means, the orifices of the female connector element being returned to operation when the closure means is actuated by a means arranged on the plug (1). The means (3) for closing off the said female connector element (2) is held in its closed position by a locking system (6), the plug (1) being able to be provided with an inserted control means (7) causing, when it is put in place on the said plug, the closure means (3) to be unlocked, the actuation of the said closure means (3) remaining subject to the means arranged on the plug.

An electric power plug system comprising 
electrical connection means and earthing means, formed 

by a male plug (1) and a female plug (2) or socket, 
said female plug (2) comprising a blocking means (3) 

brought back by a return means into a closed position 
which renders said plug inoperative by blocking its 

orifices (40, 20), the return to operation of the 
orifices of the female plug being effected when the 

blocking means is activated by a means arranged on the 
male plug (1), said blocking means (3) being held in 

its closed position by a locking system (6),
 
characterised in that said locking system (6) is 

applied by an unlocking control means (7), such that 
only a male plug provided with an interposed unlocking 

control means (7) independent of the electrical 
connection means and the earthing means is permitted to 

be introduced into the female plug, the actuation of 
the blocking means (3) after the unlocking thereof 

remaining subject to the actuating means arranged on 
the male plug. 
A plug system according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that said locking system (6) comprises two arms (60) 

mounted to rotate on the female plug (2). 
A plug system according to Claim 2, characterised 
in that said arms (60) have ends (66) arranged opposite 

the blocking means (3). 
A plug system according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that said ends (66) have a face (67
) inclined 
towards the orifices (20) of the female plug such that 

a force exerted vertically from top to bottom on said  
 

inclined face (67) tends to move said ends (66) of said 
orifices apart. 
A plug system according to any one of Claims 2 to 
4, characterised in that the arms (60) have lugs (63) 

arranged, in the locking position, opposite the 
blocking means in order to prevent any movement thereof 

in the direction tending to uncover the orifices (40, 
20). 
A plug system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the unlocking 

control means (7) is formed by a disc (70) bearing two 
bars (76) arranged on the male plug such that it is 

inserted between said male plug and the female plug 
upon connection. 
A plug system according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a restoring 

means (5, 51) brings said arms (60) back into their 
locking position. 
A plug system according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the bars (71) are arranged on either side of 

the pins (10) and separated by a distance equal to that 
between the ends (66) of the arms (60) in their locking 

position so as to come into contact with the inclined 
faces (67) during the approach movement of the male 

plug and to move the ends (66) of the arms (60) apart 
against the restoring means in order to release the 

blocking means (3). 
A plug system according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the restoring means for the locking means in 

the locking position is that returning the blocking 
means (3) into its closed position.  

 
A plug system according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that said restoring means is a spring (5) positioned 

on one of its ends in a cup (25) mounted to slide on 
the female plug and against the outer face of which the 

ends (65) of the arms (60) of the locking means (6) 
bear.
