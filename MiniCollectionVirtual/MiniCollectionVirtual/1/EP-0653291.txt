<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making sports goods or integral parts of sports goods moulded from an
epoxy resin composition.In particular it relates to a process for making sports goods or parts thereof which, when compared to
conventional goods, may have a larger volume size for a given weight or a lighter weight
for a given volume size or which, within volume or weight constraints, can have different
densities in required locations to give better performance and to the manufacture of such
items.US-A 4,328,967 discloses a method of making a bowling ball having an inner core and at
least one thermosetting resin shell which contains sufficient lightweight particles to reduce
the weight by volume of the shell by at least 5% below that a of a similar shell without said
lightweight particles while providing the necessary resilience, hardness, and long term
resistance to inertial shock characterisitics of the resulting bowling ball.US-A 5,007,463 discloses a golf club head composed of an outer shell made of a fiber-reinforced
resin and a core made of a syntactic foam and formed in the outer shell, wherein
the synthetic foam comprises a matrix resin with glass microballoons as a main component
and whiskers mixed therein to improve the impact fracture strength of the core.US-A 4,032,143 discloses a composite molded baseball bat to provide the same striking
action as a wooden baseball bat comprising a tubular, high yield strength aluminium core
while the body is constituted by a polyurethane foam.US-A 4,705,273 discloses a cushioned baseball bat preferably used with lighter and softer
balls by providing lower surface hardness and a greater compressibilty than convential
baseball bats. The baseball bats comprises a semi-rigit support structure, preferably
constructed of wood, and a deformable, resilient cushion protion constituted by a
polyurethane foam.The epoxy compositions contain at least one resin at least one hardener and at least one
filler of a specific gravity (SG) of less than 1 to enable the weight, size or density
distributions to be achieved.The composition is designed for rapid economic production utilising the Automatic
Pressure Gelation technique which itself enables the accurate manufacture of complex
shapes and also readily allows the incorporation of a wide range of inserts or spaces for
inserts as may be required as part of the end product.Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making sports implement as defined in claim 1.The filler with an SG below 1, preferably
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for making a cricket bat, baseball bat or a golf club head which comprises
introducing a curable epoxy resin composition to a mould which is at a temperature high

enough to give a suitably fast demoulding time and during the reaction process to supply
further resin under pressure to compensate for shrinkage of the composition until the

gelation point has been reached and completed for the whole moulding, wherein the
curable epoxy resin composition contains at least one filler having an SG below 1.0, and the

resulting cricket bat, baseball bat or golf club head has an SG from 0.8 to 2.0.
A process according to claim 1 in which the filler having an SG below 1 has an SG below
0.7.
A process according to claim 1 in which the filler having an SG below 1 is selected from
hollow microspheres made of glass or plastics.
A process according to claim 1 in which the curable epoxy resin composition also
contains one or more of clays, silicas, chalk, mica powder, glass powder, short length glass,

carbon or aramid fibres, aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, wollastonite, calcined
china clay, powdered thermoplastics and thermoset resin, dyes, pigments, coloured

aggregates and various toughening agents.
A process according to claim 1 in which the cricket bat, baseball bat or golf club head
has an SG of from 0.8 to 1.2.
A process according to claim 1 in which the moulding incorporates one or more inserts
into the casting.
A process according to claim 1 in which the moulding incorporates a cavity into the
moulded part.
