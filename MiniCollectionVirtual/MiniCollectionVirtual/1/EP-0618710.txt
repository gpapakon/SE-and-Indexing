<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
interface between a voice activated dialing system and 

a user. The present invention solves the problems 
presented by the prior art by providing a user interface 

which can add a name and corresponding telephone number 
to a directory during the process of initiating a 

telephone call. In addition, the present invention 
provides the user the opportunity to select which 

element of a directory listing should be changed, using 
a single integrated review, erase and change functionality 

accessible while in a directory mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to voice 
activated telephone dialing systems and more particularly 
to a method of interface between a voice activated 
dialing system and a user. Telephone networks have typically determined 
dialing information from a user based upon information 
obtained from the telephone keypad and by a live operator. 
User commands to the network were input by pulse 
or dual-tone multiple frequency (or DTMF) signals which 
were generated by the telephone instrument in response 
to the depression of keys on the keypad. These signals 
were then interpreted by the network to determine the 
keys depressed. Further information could also be 
obtained from queries from a live operator. More recently, some telephone networks have 
implemented speech recognition systems in conjunction 
with the network user-interface with respect to the 
limited functions performed by the network. One example 
is the Automated Alternative Billing System (or AABS), 
an automated billing attendant implemented by several 
telephone companies to automatically perform many of the 
tasks previously performed by a live operator with 
regard to the solicitation of collect-call billing. In 
this system, the called party is automatically queried  
 
by the system to determine if they wish to accept call 
charges. A verbal response of "yes" or "no" is received 
by the system and interpreted by a speech recognition 
algorithm. This interpretation is fed to the network 
which bills or terminates the call accordingly. U.S. Patent No. 5,052,063 to Sakanishi et al 
addresses a voice-activated user-interface directed to 
mobile telephone dialing. This patent discloses a 
system whereby a series of speech templates are held in 
a directory residing in the local customer premise 
equipment (or CPE) along with corresponding telephone 
numbers. A driver utters a speech signal corresponding 
to the party which he wishes to call. The speech signal 
is processed and compared to the speech templates stored 
in the directory. If one of the stored speech templates 
matches the uttered speech signal, a speech signal 
corresponding to the stored speech template is replayed 
to the driver and the corresponding telephone number is 
dialed automatically. Prior art user interfaces for voice activated 
dialing require a user to enter a separate directory 
function to add a new name and corresponding telephone 
number to the directory. Prior art user interfaces 
similarly lack the ability to allow the user to change 
a current listing.

with a voice activated user interface having 

storage means for storing a directory of user entered 
speech segments and corresponding telephone numbers, the 

method comprising the steps of: 
   receiving a user speech segment from said user 

corresponding to a party said user desires to call; 
   comparing the user speech segment to said 

directory to locate one of said entered speech segments 
and said corresponding stored telephone number if the 

user speech segment is recognized, and identify the user 
speech segment if it is unrecognized; 

   automatically dialing said located telephone 
number; 

   receiving a telephone number from said user 
corresponding to said unrecognized speech segment; and 

   automatically adding said unrecognized speech 
segment and corresponding telephone number to said 

directory if indicated by said user. 
The method as in claim 1, wherein the 
step of comparing further comprises the step of prompting 

said user to restate said unrecognized speech 
segment. 
The method as in claim 1, wherein the 
step of adding further includes the step of receiving an 

indication signal from said user generated by a telephone 
keypad, said indication signal indicating that the 

unrecognized speech segment and corresponding telephone 
number are to be added to said directory. 
The method as in claim 1, wherein the 
step of adding further includes the step of receiving an 

indication signal from said user generated by a rotary-dial 
mechanism, said indication signal indicating that 

the unrecognized speech segment and corresponding telephone 
number are to be added to said directory. 
The method as in claim 1, wherein the 
step of adding further includes the step of receiving an 

indication signal from said user, said indication signal 
generated by a speech recognition system acting on an 

indication speech segment generated by said user, said 
indication signal indicating that the unrecognized 

speech segment and corresponding telephone number are to 
be added to said directory. 
The method as in claim 1 further comprising 
the steps of: 

   replacing said telephone number corresponding 
to said unrecognized speech segment if indicated by said 

user; and 
   replacing said unrecognized speech segment if 

indicated by said user. 
The method as in claim 1 wherein the user 
speech segment includes a name of the party the user 

desires to call. 
The method as in claim 1 wherein the 
telephone number corresponding to said unrecognized 

speech segment is received from said user using a 
telephone key pad. 
The method as in claim 1 wherein the 
telephone number corresponding to said unrecognized 

speech segment is received from said user using a
