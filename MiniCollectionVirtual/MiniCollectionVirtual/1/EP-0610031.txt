<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with soldering fluxes
particularly with such fluxes which are useful for
soldering
the radiators of motor vehicles and heat exchanger
assemblies.Various soldering procedures are used in the
manufacture of car radiators and heat exchanger
assemblies. One of these is the baking procedure
which involves coating tubes with solder, clamping an
assembly of the tubes and of other radiator
components in a jig, spraying with flux or dipping
the assembly in flux and baking the assembly in an
oven. This procedure requires the assembly to remain
in the oven at elevated temperature usually for
several minutes. The oven temperature may be
anything from 250 to 470°C but is more likely to be
in the range 280 to 400°C. During this procedure
the solder will melt and flow into the crevices in
the joints of the assembly thereby providing the
necessary bonding. Another soldering process used in
these industries is end-dipping and this also
involves exposure to high temperature.The flux used in these soldering processes must
therefore have a sufficiently long high temperature
life to ensure that it will provide sufficient
protection to the surfaces to be joined until the
radiator has attained a temperature sufficient to
melt the solder and thereby permit bonding. Other
desirable properties of fluxes are that they should
produce low levels of char and residue and of course
have a good fluxing efficiency.Examples of fluxes which have previously been
developed for such uses are described in British
Patents Nos. 1517116 and 1553069. The earlier of 
these discloses a soldering flux which comprises an
aqueous solution containing a mixture of 25 to 75% by
weight of a hydrobromide of an aliphatic hydroxyamine and
75 to 25% by weight of a hydrobromide of an aliphatic
amine. The latter is a development of this which
describes and claims a flux which comprises an aqueous
solution containing a mixture of diethanolamine
hydrobromide and ethylamine hydrobromide together with
ammonium bromide.After soldering using these fluxes the used flux will
contain an accumulation of metal ions including copper II
and zinc II ions. The used flux is usually chemically
treated with lime or sodium hydroxide until a pH of about
9 is reached which causes the metal ions to precipitate as
insoluble hydroxides. The metal free waste is then
discharged to drain. The treatment with alkali (e.g. lime)
is carried out to remove metal ions for environmental
reasons.The applicant has now found that when used flux from
commercial fluxes
