<ABSTRACT>
In a half-bridge output stage employing a complementary 
pair of output power transistors, each driven 

through an integrating stage for controlling the slew-rate, 
a single integration capacitance is conveniently 

shared by the two integrating stages that drive the 
power transistors. A pair of switches connect the 

single integrating capacitance to the input of either 
one of the two integrating stages and are controlled by 

a pair of nonoverlapping signals that have a certain 
advance with respect to the pair of logic signals that 

drive the half-bridge stage. In the case of a driving 
system of a multi-phase machine, the two configuring 

switches of the single integration capacitor may be 
driven by a pair of control signals that drive a different 

phase winding of the multi-phase machine, thus 
eliminating the need of a dedicated circuitry for 

generating said pair of anticipated signals to control 
the configuration switches.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a slew-rate controller of 
power transistors in a half-bridge output stage employing 
a complementary transistor pair. When driving inductive loads in a switching mode, 
abrupt changes of current in the windings may cause 
electromagnetic emissions, besides causing torque 
discontinuities in electric motors that cause a noisy 
operation. A typical situation is illustrated in Fig. 1, which 
shows three separate half-bridge output stages, each 
driving one winding (L1, L2, L3) of a three-phase, DC, 
brushless motor. If, for example, it is necessary to 
switch the current from the power transistor M1 to the 
power transistor M2, an abrupt turn-off of M1 makes the 
inductance of the winding L1 discharge on the supply 
rail through the diode D4. This determines a drop of 
the current through the sensing resistance Rs of the 
control system, and a consequent change in the current 
passing through the excitation winding of the motor. In 
fact, the current regulating circuit will respond to 
keep the voltage across the sensing resistance Rs 
constant, by changing the bias conditions of the output 
transistors thus altering the current in the motor 
windings. This causes an undesirable variation of the torque. At the same time, the injection of the discharge current 
of the winding's inductance on the supply rail may 
cause disturbances on the line. It is common knowledge 
that these problems may be considerably reduced by controlling 
the turn-off time of the power transistor. In 
doing so, the following should be taken into account: 
a) the turn-off time must be long enough to allow the  
 
inductance to fully discharge; b) an excessively long turn-off delay would affect 
negatively speed performance, as occurs in driving a 
motor. Commonly, a turn-off slew-rate control is individually 
implemented for each output power transistor 
of the stage (see US-A-5191269). On the other hand, depending on the characteristics 
of the fabrication process of the integrated circuit, 
complementary and structurally similar architectures 
are highly preferable because the advantages provided 
in terms of a relatively simpler design and layout and 
higher overall performance. A half-bridge output stage 
architecture employing a pair of push-pull connected, 
complementary, power transistors, offers significant 
advantages as compared to architectures employing transistors 
of only one type which, in a bridge configuration, 
require driving circuits that are not "specular" 
to each other. An object of
