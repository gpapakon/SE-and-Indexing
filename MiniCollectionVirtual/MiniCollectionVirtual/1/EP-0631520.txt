<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to alcohol-insoluble 
polyamide (nylon) microporous membranes, to a process for their preparation and to some 
uses of these membranes. Surprisingly, the alcohol-insoluble 
microporous membranes can be prepared from alcohol-soluble 
polyamide (nylon) resins. The resins are known as 
"type 8 nylons" and are N-alkoxyalkylated nylons. It was particularly 
unexpected that alcohol-insoluble microporous membranes 
could be prepared from an alcohol-soluble nylon resin 
because the previous polyamide microporous membranes prepared 
from alcohol-soluble nylon resins had always been alcohol soluble. 
Also the microporous membranes of this invention are hydrophilic. 
This is surprising for at least some of the membranes 
because previous microporous membranes prepared from 
polyamide resins having a ratio of methylene CH2 to amide 
NHCO groups which is greater than about 7 have been hydrophobic. 
The membranes are microporous sheets having an absolute 
particle removal capability in the range of about 0.1 micron 
and larger. The term "alcohol-soluble" is used herein to refer 
to materials which are soluble in lower aliphatic alcohols 
such as methanol and ethanol. The prior art is replete with various nylon membranes. 
However, the microporous membranes which have been prepared 
from alcohol-soluble nylon resins heretofor have been alcohol 
soluble and this has severely restricted the usefulness of the 
membranes. For example, Lovell et al. (US-A-2,783,894) and 
Paine (US-A-3,408,315) provide a process for producing 
alcohol-soluble polyamide membrane sheet using nylon 4 
(poly-ε-butyrolactam). The membranes are prepared by forming 
an alcohol-water solution containing the nylon 4, adjusting it 
to the point of incipient precipitation by the addition of a  
 
solvent miscible nonsolvent which decreases the solubility of 
the nylon, casting the solution on an optically smooth surface 
of a solid base, and converting to a solid film by exposure to 
an atmosphere containing a constantly maintained concentration 
of exchangeable nonsolvent vapors, i.e. vapors of a liquid in 
which the nylon is not soluble but which are exchangeable with 
vapors of the solvent for the nylon. The resultant membranes 
are soluble in alcohol, as well as in a considerable number of 
other solvents, and may not be steam sterilized, which limits 
the scope of their usefulness. Hiratsuka et al. (US-A-3,746,668) also prepares 
membranes from alcohol solution of alcohol-soluble polyamides, 
gelling the solution
