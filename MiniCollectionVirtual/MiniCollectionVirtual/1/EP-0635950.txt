<ABSTRACT>
An active branching unit for interconnecting three cables (two trunk 
cables and one spur cable) each including optical fibres. In a first 

interconnection configuration fibres of the trunk cables are 
connected together via the spur cable. Optical switch means, 

comprised for example by an erbium doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) 
(20) and an optical attenuator (21) in series, are disposed between 

optical fibres of the two trunk cables and are such as to pass 
telecommunications traffic between the trunk cables when, for 

example, there is fault in the spur cable and an alternative 
configuration is required. In this case a pump signal is applied to 

the EDFA (20) and the loss of the attenuator (21) overcome so that 
traffic can pass directly between the trunk cables and thus be 

diverted from the spur cable. This path switching can be achieved 
automatically.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to branching units for telecommunications 
optical cable systems, e.g. optical fibre submarine cable systems, 
and specifically to a branching unit with optical traffic switching 
capabilities. Long haul, e.g. submarine cable systems originally were such as to 
connect two land terminals which were, for example, on opposite 
sides of the Atlantic ocean. A later development involved having 
two land terminals on one side and a third on the other side, there 
being a main cable extending between the third land terminal and a 
branching unit (y interconnect) and spur cables extending from the 
branching unit to the two other terminals. Repeaters may be 
disposed in the main cable and the spur cables and power feed 
provision must thus be made. The repeaters can be powered by 
supplying current between a land terminal (terminal station) at one 
end of a branch (main or spur) cable and a distant earth (single end 
feeding) or between any two terminal stations (double end feeding). 
With a known type of branching unit power feed of repeaters in the 
main cable and one spur cable is by double end feeding, whereas 
that of repeaters in the other spur cable is by single end feeding, 
the earth being provided by a sea earth cable integral with the 
branching unit. The branching unit may include relays by means of 
which the power feeding can be changed (switched) in the event of 
fault conditions in one of the branches, in order to isolate that 
branch whilst continuing to power the other branches. Optical fibre submarine cable systems for long haul applications are 
now being designed with many landing points, and thus many 
branching units, and complicated traffic routing requirements. A 
basic branching unit suitable for multiple branching unit systems is 
disclosed in our GB Specification No 2252686A. This basic unit is  
 
however a passive unit, i.e. it does not involve 
repeaters/regenerators for the optical signals, which is designed to 
terminate three line cables and also to provide a sea earth for 
power feeding. A subsequent design included optical repeaters 
(regenerators) which required power feeding, as disclosed in GB 
Application No 9304328.9 (USA application No. 206002) in which 
there is a facility to power auxiliary circuitry, such as repeaters, in 
view of a Zener diode chain and a full wave rectifier bridge. According to the present invention there is provided a branching 
unit for use in a telecommunications optical cable system for 
interconnecting three line cables,

<CLAIMS>
A branching unit for use in a telecommunications optical 
cable system for interconnecting three line cables, each including 

optical fibres, the branching unit including means whereby the 
optical fibres of the cables are initially interconnected in a first 

configuration and optical switch means whereby the optical fibres of 
the cables can be interconnected in at least one alternative 

configuration, characterised in that the optical switch means is 
actuable automatically in response to the occurrence of faults in the 

cables, and that the optical switches are actuable by a supervisory 
system for selection of any required configuration for the first 

configuration and/or for selection of an alternative configuration 
upon a cable fault occurrence. 
A branching unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the optical switches each comprise a respective rare earth 

doped fibre amplifier having a respective optical pump source, 
being in series with a respective optical attenuator and coupled 

between two optical fibres to be interconnected in a said alternative 
configuration by respective optical couplers, and wherein the said 

alternative configuration is obtained when the optical pump source 
is activated in response to a cable fault. 
A branching unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the optical switches each comprise a respective electro-mechanical 

optical switch coupled between two optical fibres to be 
interconnected in a said alternative configuration by respective 

optical couplers, which switch includes an optical path which is 
normally open circuit and closable by application of a suitable drive 

current to a switch relay coil in response to a cable fault. 
A branching unit as claimed in claim 2 or 3, characterised 
in that the cable system employs electrical power feeding, wherein 

the unit includes respective terminations for electrical power 
conductors of the three cables and an electrical power termination 

for a sea earth and serves to interconnect the cables and the sea 
earth for power feeding and wherein the power required for 

 
activating the optical switch is derived from the current supplied via 

the power conductors of two of said cables. 
A branching unit as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that the other of said three cables comprises a spur cable which is 

powered via the sea earth, wherein a current sense circuit is 
disposed between the sea earth termination and the spur cable, 

and wherein when a fault in the spur cable is sensed by the current 
sense circuit the respective optical switch is activated. 
A branching unit as claimed in claim 5, characterised in 
that the said cables each include at least two pairs of optical fibres, 

wherein in the first configuration the two said cables comprise trunk 
cables and have one pair of thei
r optical fibres directly connected 
together and the other pair of their optical fibres are connected 

together via the pairs of optical fibres of the spur cable, and wherein 
a respective optical switch for each fibre connection is disposed 

between the trunk cables across the fibres of the other pairs and 
when activated upon a spur cable fault serves to divert 

telecommunications traffic away from the spur cable. 
A branching unit as claimed in claim 6, further including for 
each trunk cable respective optical switches between the fibres of 

the one and the other pairs, which switches when activated serve to 
direct telecommunications traffic away from a trunk cable in which a 

fault has occurred.
