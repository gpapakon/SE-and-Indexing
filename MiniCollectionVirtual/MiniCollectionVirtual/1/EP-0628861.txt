<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide
photographic material and a method of forming a ultrahigh
contrast negative image using the same. More particularly,
it relates to a ultrahigh contrast negative silver halide
photographic material suitable for use in photomechanical
process.In the field of graphic arts, an image formation
system providing ultrahigh contrast (especially a gamma
exceeding 10) is required for achieving satisfactory
reproduction of a dot image having continuous tone or a line
image.Image formation systems of using hydrazine
derivatives have been proposed to obtain a high contrast
image while using a stable developing solution as disclosed
in U.S. Patents 4,224,401, 4,168,977, 4,166,742, 4,311,781,
4,272,606, and 4,211,857. According to these systems,
ultrahigh contrast and high sensitivity can be obtained.
Further, since addition of a sulfite to a developing solution
in a high concentration is permissive, stability of the
developing solution against air oxidation can be greatly
improved over lith developers. Nevertheless, hydrazine
compounds which have been proposed to date turned out to have 
several disadvantages. That is, while it has been attempted
to make the structure of hydrazine compounds non-diffusive
for the purpose of minimizing adverse influences which may
arise from the hydrazine compounds dissolved in a developing
solution. These non-diffusive hydrazine compounds should be
used in large quantities for sufficient sensitization and
improvement in contrast so that they are apt to cause
deterioration of physical properties of the developed light-sensitive
layers or to precipitate in a coating composition.
Further, when a light-sensitive material containing such a
non-diffusive hydrazine compound fails to obtain sufficient
high contrast when developed with a fatigued developing
solution after use for processing a large volume of
photographic materials.In addition, a high contract system using the
conventional hydrazine compound involves use of a developing
solution having a relatively high pH, e.g., 12.0 or higher,
which entails not only danger on handling but cost for waste
liquid treatment due to high BOD or COD. Because a large
amount of a pH buffer must be added to a developing solution
for maintaining the pH constant, the developing solution is
sticky due to the so increased solid content and is hardly
wiped away when scattered.It has therefore been demanded to develop a hydrazine
compound which can achieve high contrast image formation 
while using a developing
