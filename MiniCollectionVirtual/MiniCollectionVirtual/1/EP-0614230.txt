<ABSTRACT>
A high output semiconductor device (101) mounting a 
plurality of FET elements (101a) on a semi-insulating 

semiconductor substrate (1), comprises a prescribed 
conductivity type semiconductor layer (2) formed on the 

semi-insulating semiconductor substrate (1), a plurality of 
source and drain electrodes (10a, 10b) alternatingly 

arranged on the semiconductor layer (2), a plurality of gate 
electrodes (10) respectively disposed in gate recesses 

(110), each recess is formed by etching each surface region 
of the semiconductor layer (2) between each adjacent source 

and drain electrodes (10a, 10b). The gate recess (110) has 
the asymmetrical two-stage recess structure having a second 

bottom surface (112a) only at the source side part of the 
side wall of the recess (110), wherein the second bottom 

surface (112a) is positioned at a depth between a first 
bottom surface (111a) in contact with the gate electrode 

(10) and the upper surface of the semiconductor layer (2) 
and is not in contact with the gate electrode (10). 

Therefore, the thickness (Da2) of the active layer at the 
source side part is larger that that (Da1) in the one-stage 

recess structure, with a result that the source resistance 
is reduced because of an increase in the thickness (Da2) of 

the active layer at the source side region while avoiding 
deterioration of the gate drain breakdown voltage due to an  

 
increase in the thickness of the active layer at the drain 

side region.
