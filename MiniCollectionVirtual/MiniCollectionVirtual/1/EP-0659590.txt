<ABSTRACT>
Process for making a patterned surface layer on bodies made of nonferrous (heavy), light or noble metals, the pattern desired on the surface layer being impressed as a mirror image into a plastic film with a thickness of 5  mu m to 1 mm, the patterning on the plastic film facing the surface layer to be patterned and the patterning on the plastic film being transferred to the surface layer by subjecting the plastic film to pressure while it rests on the surface layer, the patterning transferred having a depth of between 0.001 and 20  mu m. The process is suitable, in particular, for transferring fine patterns with a submicron depth of between 0.001 and 1  mu m and for pattern elements whose dimensions in the plane horizontal relative to the patterned surface layer are between 1 nm and 1 mm. The process is preferably used to pattern the surface layers of sheets, strips or foils made of nonferrous, light or noble metals with a thickness of from 5  mu m to 50 mm and is suitable, in particular, for the production of functional or decorative surface layers on bodies made of the said metals.

Process for structuring the surface layer of bodies of non-ferrous, light or precious 
metals, characterised in that the structuring desired on the surface layer is stamped 

in mirror image on a plastic film having a thickness of 5 µm to 1 mm, the 
structuring of the plastic film is directed towards the surface layer to be structured 

and the structuring situated on the plastic film is transferred to the surface layer by 
applying pressure to the plastic film lying on the surface layer, the transferred 

structuring having a depth of between 0.001 and 20 µm. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the pressure is applied by 
milling, reducing, pressing, reeling or rolling. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the average reduction in 
thickness upon the application of pressure is between 0 and 15 %. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the structuring transferred to 
the surface layer has a submicrometre structure depth of between 0.001 and 1 µm 

and, in particular, between 0.01 and 0.5 µm. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the structuring transferred to 
the surface layer at least partially contains structural elements the dimensions of 

which in the plane which is horizontal relative to the structured surface layer are 
between 1 nm and 1 mm. 
Use of the process according to claim 1 for structuring sheets, strips or foils of 
non-ferrous, light or precious metals having a thickness of from 5 µm to 50 mm. 
Use of the process according to claim 1 for producing functional or decorative 
surface layers of bodies of non-ferrous, light or precious metals. 
Use of the process according to claim 1 for producing reflecting surfaces or 
mirrors with a predetermined direction of reflection for the controlled deflection or 

scattering of electromagnetic radiation.  
 
Use of the process according to claim 1 for producing reflecting surfaces or 
mirrors as filters with selective reflecting properties with respect to the wavelength 

and/or the polarisation of the incident electromagnetic radiation. 
Use of the process according to claim 1 for producing decorative surface layers 
with variable colours and/or structures dependent on the angle of viewing and/or 

the light incidence. 
Use of the process according to claim 1 for producing holograms, company and 
manufacturer's logos or instructions for use on packages, equipment housings or 

panels, as well as identifying designs, logos or labels, the structured surface layers 
being highly forgery-proof. 
Use of the process according to claim 1 for producing lithographic substrates. 
Use of the process according to claim 1 for producing substrates for photovoltaic 
cells.
