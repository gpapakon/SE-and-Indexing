<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and 
apparatus for editing two-dimensional data for 
generating three-dimensional data. More particularly, 
it relates to a method of and an apparatus for editing 
two-dimensional data of an original three-dimensional 
object expressed as a perspective view. It is often desired to determine three-dimensional 
object data representing positions 
expressed by three-dimensional coordinates of those 
points constituting an appearance shape of an original 
three-dimensional object from a perspective view 
projecting the three-dimensional object on a two-dimensional 
plane. Here, the perspective view projected on the 
two-dimensional plane includes a photograph, an 
electronic image, a sketch, a picture, and an image 
displayed on a display device in a CAD (Computer Aided 
Design) system or a graphic processing system. For 
example, it is often desired to form a model of a 
three-dimensional object on the basis of a sketch of 
the three-dimensional object worked out by an 
industrial designer in order to design the appearance  
 
of a product. When two or more perspective views drawn 
from different visual points are available, a method 
based on a binocular stereoscopic vision method can be 
applied, as disclosed, for example, in "Modeling of 3-Dimensional 
Shape from Drawings" Nishihara, Computer 
Today July, 1993, No. 56 pp. 19-29, 48-52. However, 
when the perspective view available is only one, the 
sole method known heretofore is for an object which is 
plane-symmetrical, as disclosed in, for example, in JP-A-3-154972, 
"Recovery of 3D information from a 2D image 
Using the Mirror Symmetry in the Object" Z. Kiuwei et 
al, Bulletin of JSSD No. 78, 1990, or "Automatic 
Reconstruction of a Polyhedron from Orthographic Views" 
Masuda et al, CG symposium '92, September, 1992, pp. 
105-114. In Japanese patent application No. 4-296775 
entitled "Method of and Apparatus for determining 
object Data from Perspective View" (corresponding to 
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/147,316 and EP 
Patent Application No. 93117970.9 both filed on 
November 9, 1993), a novel method is proposed to 
generate object data of a three-dimensional object, 
which is not limited to a plane-symmetric one, from one 
perspective view. This method uses a perspective view 
of the type in which a sectional line of an object 
(corresponding to a slice of the object) is drawn. By 
the method, an equation representing a plane of the 
slice in the three-dimensional space inclusive of the  
 
perspecti
