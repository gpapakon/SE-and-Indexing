<ABSTRACT>
Optical loupes comprise a frame (12) supporting two optical devices (2) each of which has an ocular (3) and an objective (4). The frame has side arms or stems (24) and a bridge (not shown) enabling the frame to be worn like a pair of spectacles whereby the optical devices are located immediately in front of the respective eyes of the viewer. The optical axis (4) of the ocular and the optical axis (42) of the objective intersect at an angle of about 135 DEG  and a Schmidt prism (23) redirects light from the objective to the ocular in each case. A light source (30) is provided on said frame between said optical devices and provides a gradually diverging light beam to illuminate an object being reviewed. The optical axes of the respective objectives converge at said object being reviewed. The loupes allow the user to observe at a level below his/her normal line of sight whilst maintaining the head in an upright position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to binoculars or loupes and more particularly to loupes which
allow a viewer to closely and conveniently observe an object which is being
manipulated by the hands of the viewer below the normal level of eyesight.When performing surgery, for example, a surgeon relies on a high level of eye hand
co-ordination generally with a small margin for error and so to enhance the
precision and accuracy of the surgery it is necessary to magnify the region of the
operation. Operating optical microscopes which comprise optical devices mounted
on fixed stands have been used by surgeons for this purpose. However the field
of view of these microscopes is set at the beginning of an operation and is not
easily reset if a surgeon needs to alter the field of view to gain a better perspective
of the operation or of the operating region.It is also common for surgeons to wear small head mounted binoculars or loupes
to magnify their field of view. However as the level of an operation is below the
normal level of eyesight of the surgeon, the head of the surgeon must be inclined
to enable him to watch and co-ordinate his hands. During long operations even a
slight inclination of the head can overwork the muscles of the neck discomforting the
surgeon and providing an additional unnecessary distraction. This problem is
compounded by the weight of the head mounted loupes.To allow a surgeon to sit and concentrate in one position for a long length of time
and reduce the stress on the muscles of the neck it is preferable that the head and
neck of the surgeon be in an upright aligned position so that the surgeon's line of
sight is straight ahead. However due to the level of an operation this position is not
possible with existing loupes.Furthermore this problem is not exclusively confined to those in the surgical
profession. In fact any person such as a jeweller who is using existing loupes and
manipulating very small objects for any length of time will encounter the same
problems associated with inclination of the head, as the surgeon. 
It is an object of the present invention to provide an
apparatus which allows a person to view and co-ordinate
his/her hands below the normal line of sight without
having to incline his/her head and also to allow the
person to readily change the field of view being
magnified.WO-A-9106025 discloses optical
loupes according to the prior art, and US-A-4652094 discloses
binocular microscopes according to the prior art.According to the present invention there are
provided optical loupes

<CLAIMS>
Optical loupes comprising a pair of optical devices
(2) mounted on a frame for attachment on the head of a

user whereby each optical device is in proximity to a
respective eye of the user, wherein each optical device

(2) has an ocular (3) and an objective (4) which defines
a field of view, the ocular and the objective each having

an optical axis (4, 42), light transfer means (23) for
redirecting light from the objective to the ocular

whereby an object which appears in the field of view of
the objective is capable of being viewed through the

ocular, and a light source (30) for providing a gradually
diverging light beam directed to illuminate the object

being viewed, wherein the optical axes of the respective
objectives are arranged to converge at an object to be

viewed in a converging field of vision, characterised in
that the optical axis (42) of the objective intersects

with the optical axis (4) of the ocular in each device

(2) and the light source (30) is provided on the frame
between the optical devices and is directed to illuminate

the object being viewed co-axially with said converging
field of vision.
Optical loupes as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
optical axes (4,42) of the ocular (3) and objective (4)

intersect at an angle in the range 120°-150°.
Optical loupes as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
optical axes (4,42) of the ocular (3) and objective (4)

intersect at an angle of about 135°. 
Optical loupes as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the light beam and the optical axes (42) of the

respective objectives (4) are co-focused at the object.
Optical loupes as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the frame (12) has respective side arms (24) and

a nose support, whereby the loupes are worn similar to a
pair of spectacles with each ocular (3) proximal a

respective eye of the user.
Optical loupes as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the light transfer means is a Schmidt prism (23).
Optical loupes as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein each optical device (2) is mounted on the frame

(12) for limited lateral adjustment whereby the
interpupillary distance may be adjusted, the optical

devices being lockable in position on the frame by
respective locking screws (14).
Optical loupes as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein each ocular contains a pair of ocular lenses

(6,7) and a field lens (8) and each objective contains a
pair of objective lenses (18,19) located at a distal end

of the objective.
