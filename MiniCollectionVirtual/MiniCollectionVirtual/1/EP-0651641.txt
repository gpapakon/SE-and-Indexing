<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new bioactive
composition for treating the symptoms of vulvitis
and vulvovaginitis (genital fluor) as well as
a process for the preparation thereof.The symptoms mentioned and their treatment
raise a number of problems since the restoration
of a health damage arising from the
abnormal function of vagina is connected
also with a rapid reconstitution or with
the possibility of a rapid reconstitution
of epitheliam tissues and not only with curing
the symptoms of the disease. The character
of the treatment of genital fluor is discussed
by Dr. S. Gardó in two papers entitled: "The
Causes and Treatment of Genital Fluor" /Magyar
Nõorvosok Lapja (Journal of Hungarian
Gynecologists) 54, pp. 7-12 (1991)/ and:
"The Treatment of Genital Fluor" /ibidem54,
pp., 187-191 (1991)/.It is known that the development or
reconstitution of the appropriate normal
microflora of lactobacilli in the vagina
contributes to the supression of symptoms,
however, there exists several possibilities
and variations for restoring the normal state
and the effect of these cannot uniformly
be assured in each case.In the Hungarian patent specification
No. 190,732 about hundred ingredients are
described (disclosed), nearly thirty combinations
of which are suggested to prepare for 
restoration of the normal microflora in the vagina. These
combinations are aimed to achieve the same effect such as the
increase in the germ number of lactobacilli or the restriction
of pathogenic or pseudopathogenic microorganisms, respectively
however, several combinations had to be tested in a number of
cases, the suppression of symptoms was lengthy from time to
time or the combination did not show an adequate activity.The assuring of absorption is also an important factor in the
use of therapeutical products. According to the experience the
traditional W/O and O/W type ointments and emulsions as well
as aqueous or alcoholic (ethanolic) solutions do not promote
and even inhibit the development of a suitable effect on
treating the symptoms of vulvitis.The present invention relates to a composition, which is in
general useful for alleviating the symptoms of vulvitis and
vulvovaginitis and exerts a regenerative and inuring effect,
too on the epithelial tissues injured and/or irritated.In an other aspect, the present invention relates to the
stabilization and fast absorption of the composition.A subject-matter of the present invention is a pharmaceutical
composition for treating the symptoms of vulvitis or vulvovaginitis,
which comprises
