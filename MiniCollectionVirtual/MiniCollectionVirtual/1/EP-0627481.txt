<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to invert drilling fluids and more
specifically to environmentally friendly drilling fluids whose oil phase includes linear
alpha-olefins having from 14 to 30 carbon atoms.Historically, first crude oils, then diesel oils and, most recently,
mineral oils have been used in formulating invert drilling fluids (oil based muds).
Due to problems of toxicity and persistence which are associated with these oils, and
which are of special concern in off-shore use, the industry is developing drilling fluids
which use "pseudo-oils" for the oil phase. Examples of such oils are fatty acid esters
and branched chain synthetic hydrocarbons such as polyalphaolefins. Fatty acid ester
based oils have excellent environmental properties, but drilling fluids made with these
esters tend to have lower densities and are prone to hydrolytic instability. Polyalphaolefin
based drilling fluids can be formulated to high densities, have good
hydrolytic stability and low toxicity. They are, however, somewhat less
biodegradable than esters, they are expensive and the fully weighted, high density
fluids tend to be overly viscous. U.S. Patent 5,096,883 discloses the use of such
branched chain synthetic, hydrogenated oils which have the advantage, over most
natural petroleum base oils, of being considered "non-toxic" in that they pass the
standard "Ninety-Six Hour Static Bioassay" test for mortality of mysid shrimp. The
toxicity of natural oils is indicated to be due to the presence of aromatics and n-olefins
in such oils.US-A-4 508 628 discloses a straight chain paraffine-containing base oil for water in oil
emulsions used in drilling into rock formations in the production of crude oil and natural
gas. The specific problem addressed by this reference is the provision of environmentally
safe formulations for fast drilling in ofshore formations. The solution of this specific
problem is the use of paraffines with low aromatics content as the oil phase in these
formulations due to their low toxicity.EP-A-0 369 320 provides formulations for cutting and grinding plastics and metals to
improve surface detergency, to prevent rust and to enhance wear resistance. The disclosed
formulations are lubricating oil compositions having a content of straight chain olefins
between 6 and 40 carbon atoms. The document is, however, not related to drilling muds.We have now found that less expensive drilling fluids having excellent
technical and environmental properties can be formulated by using linear alpha-olefins
(n-olefins) as
