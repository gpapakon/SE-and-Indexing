<ABSTRACT>
In a rubber/impression blanket tensioning device on a cylinder of a rotary printing machine, the object is to prevent loosening of the rubber/impression blanket even when the cylinder changes direction of rotation. According to the invention, this object is achieved in that a drive for tightening a tension spindle is assigned at least one blocking device which acts in one direction of rotation and prevents loosening of the rubber/impression blanket.

<CLAIMS>
Device for tensioning a rubber blanket or
printing blanket (10) on a cylinder (2) of a rotary

printing machine, having a rotatable tensioning spindle
(14) which is arranged in a cylinder groove (1) and

runs parallel to the cylinder axis, a blocking
mechanism (17, 72, 58, 56, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 61, 64,

62) being provided which blocks in the "SLACKEN RUBBER
or PRINTING BLANKET" direction in order to block the

tensioning spindle (14), and it being optionally
possible to cancel the blocking action of the blocking

mechanism (17, 72, 58, 56, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 61, 64,
62), a drive (18, 19, 21, 22; 23, 24, 26, 27) for the

tensioning spindle (14) being provided; the drive (18,
19, 21, 22; 23, 24, 26, 27) comprising a plurality of

racks (18, 19, 21, 22), which are arranged in a
cylinder groove (1), transversely with respect to an

axis of rotation (52) of the tensioning spindle (14),
and can be moved by means of an actuator (47, 57)

counter to a pre-tensioning force of springs (23, 24,
26, 27); and the racks (18, 19, 21, 22) engaging with

toothing (17) on the periphery of the tensioning
spindle (14).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the actuator (47, 57) is constructed as an air

hose (47; 57).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the blocking mechanism (56; 59, 61, 62, 63, 66,

67) which is provided is a rack (58) which can be moved
transversely with respect to the axis of rotation (52)

of the tensioning spindle (14) and engages with the
tensioning spindle (14), in that a pivotably arranged,

two-armed lever (66) having a first lever arm (68)
constructed as a switching lever arm (68) and a second

lever arm (69) constructed as a pawl (69) is provided
on the rack (58), in that the pawl end (69) of the

lever (66) can be brought into engagement with toothing
(71) that is fixed to the cylinder, in that a 

displaceable bolt (64, 61) is arranged such that it can
be brought into engagement with the switching-lever arm

end (68) of the lever (66) in order to produce a
pivoting movement of the lever (66).
