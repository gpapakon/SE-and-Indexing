<ABSTRACT>
A method of hot-dip-zinc-plating a Si, Mn or Cr-containing high-strength and high-tension steel plate as a 
basis steel plate reduced in unplated portions, so as to produce a hot dip zinc-plated steel plate or a hot dip alloyed 

zinc-plated steel plate, characterized in that the method is capable of minimizing the complication of a process and 
a decrease in the productivity and producing at a low cost high-quality hot dip zinc-plated steel plates. The present 

invention can be effected by recrystallization annealing in a continuous annealing equipment a cold rolled steel plate 
containing at least one of not less than 0.1 wt% and not more than 2.0 wt% of Si, not less than 0.5 wt% and not 

more than 2.0 wt% of Mn and not less than 0.1 wt% and not more than 2.0 wt% of Cr, and not more than 0.2 wt% 
of P as necessary; cooling the annealed product; removing a concentrated layer of steel components in a steel plate 

surface by polishing, or pickling, or a combination of polishing and pickling; and thermally reducing the steel plate in 
continuous hot dip zinc plating equipment at not less than 650 °C and not more than a recrystallization temperature, 

whereby the hot dip zinc plating, or the top plating and/or alloying, or, additionally, the post-alloying top plating of 
the steel plate is done.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for hot dip
galvanizing high tensile steel strips with minimal bare
spots which starts with high tensile steel strips for use
in automobile bodies and manufactures hot dip galvanized
and galvannealed steel strips.Heretofore, various surface treated steel strips
having improved corrosion resistance have been used as
automotive steel strips. Among them, widespread are
galvanized steel strips which are manufactured in a
continuous hot dip galvanizing line wherein
recrystallization annealing and galvanizing are carried out
in a common line, because of a high degree of corrosion
resistance and low cost manufacture as well as galvannealed
steel strips which are manufactured by subjecting the
galvanized steel strips to heat treatment, because of
weldability and press workability in addition to corrosion
resistance.Meanwhile, a global environment problem is recently
highlighted and it is urgently required to reduce the 
weight of automobiles for fuel consumption improvement.
With this target, high strength/high tensile steel strips
whose strength is increased were developed. Zinc hot dip
galvanizing and galvannealing are now required for
providing corrosion resistance.High tensile steel strips are increased in strength by
adding Si, Mn, Cr or the like to steel. In manufacturing
zinc hot dip galvanized steel strips through a continuous
galvanizing line (abbreviated as CGL, hereinafter), the
components added for strength enhancement tend to
concentrate at the steel strip surface during annealing
reduction. These elements as oxides form an oxide film at
the surface.As a consequence, a significant loss of wettability
occurs between steel strip and molten zinc, resulting in
bare spots, uncoated defects or uncovered defects.Prior art methods devised for preventing generation of
bare spots include a method of electroplating steel strip
prior to its entry into CGL (see JP-A 194156/1990) and a
method of providing a surface layer of steel having a low
content of Si, Mn or the like by a cladding technique for
improving plating wettability (see JP-A 199363/1991). Also
proposed is a method of further adding Ti to steel for
improving wettability to molten zinc (see JP-A
148073/1992).Although hot dip galvanizing of a high strength steel
strip containing Si, Mn or the like becomes possible by
carrying out electroplating of a Ni or Fe system on the 
steel strip prior to its entry into CGL, there accompany
addition of an electroplating plant, complication by an
increased number of steps, and
