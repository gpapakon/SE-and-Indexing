<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for coloring polymethacrylates or polyglutarimides in 
an extruder comprises admixing the molten thermoplastic, conveyed directly from 

the polymerization operation, in an extruder mixing zone with a dispersion of at 
least one pigment, dye, or colorant in a suitable clear carrier, then conveying the 

admixed colored thermoplastic into an extrusion zone or injection molding zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for colouring thermoplastics.Since the advent of clear moldable thermoplastics, it has been desired to
prepare them in colored form, whether transparent, translucent, or opaque. Many
processes exist in the art which have been evaluated to accomplish the coloration
uniformly, efficiently, and cheaply. Among these exist processes for adding
colorants in dry form to the molten thermoplastic, for adding colorants in dry form
to a solid polymer and mixing in the molten state, and for adding colorants in
solution or dispersion to a solid polymer as it is fed to an extruder for first melting
and then mixing in the molten state.It has been considered potentially cost-effective and energy-conserving if the
colorant could be added to the molten matrix thermoplastic polymer as it is
processed upon leaving the reactor wherein it has been prepared. Further, the
method would offer much easier cleanup and color changes than when the colorant
is added at the rear of the extruder, such as with the feed of pellets to be re-melted.
Further, the matrix polymer would receive less thermal history and thus avoid
potential degradation problems from excess heating prior to forming the final object.
Further, such a process should allow better control and less variability of the
colorant content, especially when low levels of colorant, such as for toning or optical
brightening, are involved.Such preparative/extrusive manufacturing processes are common for
methacrylic polymers, that is, polymers with at least 80 weight percent of their units
derived from methyl methacrylate, especially where the polymer is prepared by a
continuous technology, unreacted monomer removed by devolatilization and
recycled, and the devolatilized polymer conveyed directly to an extrusion process
for forming pellets, film or sheet. Such a preparative/extrusive process is also
common for polyglutarimides, wherein the molten methyl methacrylate polymer is
reacted in an extruder with a primary amine, such as monomethylamine, to form the
glutarimide units, optionally treated with an alkylating agent such as triethyl
orthoformate or dimethyl carbonate to lower the acid and anhydride content, and
then conveyed directly to an extrusion process for forming pellets, film or sheet.However, a colorant process where the colorant is added to the molten
polymer just prior to pelletization or extrudation or molding would offer similar
advantages over other colorant methods, even if the polymer has been formed
separately and cooled,

<CLAIMS>
A process for coloring thermoplastic polymers in an extruder comprising:

a). conducting into a mixing zone of the extruder a molten thermoplastic
polymer selected from at least one of (1) a polyglutarimide or (2) a polymer

containing at least 80 weight percent of units derived from methyl methacrylate;
b). admixing the molten thermoplastic polymer in the mixing zone of the
extruder with a dispersion of at least one pigment, dye or colorant in a carrier,

wherein:

(I). the pigment, dye, or colorant is present at from 0.0001 parts to
5 parts per 100 parts of thermoplastic polymer;
(II). the carrier is present at from 15 parts to 99.9 parts per 100 parts
of the dispersion;
(III). the carrier is present at no more than 1 part per 100 parts of
thermoplastic polymer; and
(IV). the carrier:

(i). when admixed with the thermoplastic polymer at up to
the 1% level, has no deleterious effect on the color or clarity of

the resulting blend;
(ii). has a viscosity below 1 Pa s (1000 cp.), or an ability to
be pumped at a uniform rate into the extruder at a temperature

which does not cause any turbulence or bubbles in the pumped
colorant dispersion;
(iii). gives rise to a decrease in thermal stability of a blend of
the thermoplastic polymer plus 0.5 weight percent of the carrier

(no colorant) of no more than 10 degrees centigrade, when
compared to the thermoplastic polymer containing no carrier, as

measured by thermogravimetric analysis or by a spiral flow
test; 
(iv). gives rise to no significant decrease in accelerated
weatherability stability of a blend of the thermoplastic polymer

plus 0.5 weight percent of the carrier (no colorant), when
compared to the thermoplastic polymer containing no carrier, as

judged by visual appearance and lack of color shift or haze
formation; and
(v). has a sufficiently low volatility that the admixed
thermoplastic polymer and dispersion of pigment, dye or

colorant in the carrier can be extruded and molded into bubble-free
objects without requiring a devolatilization step after the

mixing operation; and
c). conducting the admixed colored thermoplastic polymer into an
extrusion zone or injection molding zone.
The process of claim 1, wherein the carrier is an unsaturated polyester of
viscosity at room temperature below 1 Pa s (1000 cp).
The process of claims 1 or 2, wherein there is added to the extruder mixing
zone at least one of the following: a lubricant, an ultraviolet stabilizer, a hindered

amine light stabilizer, an anti-oxidant, a stabilizer against degradation by sterilizing

radiation, and a thermal stabilizer.
The process of claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein the colorant is an anthraquinone or
perinone dye.
The process of claims 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein the colorant contains carbon black.
