<ABSTRACT>
A direct forced draft counterflow water cooling tower module (10) includes an integral one-piece frame (12) and basin (32) preferably constructed from molded fiberglass. The cooling tower includes a liquid distribution system (116), fill material (128) located below the liquid distribution system, a drainage collection system (82) located below the fill material and at least one fan (38) located below the drainage collection system. The fan (38) blows cooling air directly upward through the drainage collection system (82) and then through the fill material (128).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cooling
tower apparatus, and more particularly, but not by way of
limitation, to industrial water cooling towers.One common type of industrial cooling tower is a
counterflow tower wherein water falls downward through a
fill layer while cooling air moves upward through the
fill material. The term "counterflow" refers to the fact
that the warm water and cool air are moving in opposite
directions.Counterflow cooling towers may be of three types,
namely induced draft, natural draft, and forced draft.An induced draft counterflow cooling tower has a fan
located on top of the tower which sucks air up through
the fill material. Air flows laterally along the ground
surface adjacent the tower and once it is under the tower
it turns ninety degrees and flows upward through the fill
material, with this flow being induced by the fans on top
of the tower which suck the air up through the tower.
Examples of induced draft counterflow cooling towers are
seen in U. S. Patents Nos. 4,267,130 and 4,301,097, both
to Curtis.U. S. Patent No. 4,521,350 to Lefevre, shows at FIG.
1 thereof a natural draft counterflow cooling tower. A
natural draft cooling tower does not utilize a fan to
assist the air flow, but instead relies upon the natural
tendency of warmer air to flow upward. The natural draft
cooling tower shown in Patent 4,521,350 is the type
commonly referred to as a hyperbolic natural draft
cooling tower. The Lefevre patent shows the use of a 
drainage collection system below the fill material in the
natural draft counterflow cooling tower thereshown.U. S. Patents Nos. 2,606,750 and 2,915,302 to Jacir
show forced draft counterflow water cooling towers.
Forced draft towers have a fan located on the side of the
tower which blows air into a plenum chamber on the lower
side of the tower. A plurality of vanes are used to turn
the air ninety degrees to direct it upward through the
tower. The Jacir apparatus utilizes a drainage
collection system located below the fill. As used in
the trade, the term "forced draft" is understood to refer
to a system like that of Jacir having a fan on the side
of the tower blowing into a lower plenum so that the air
must then turn ninety degrees to flow upward through the
tower.A second common type of cooling tower is a cross
flow tower. Cross flow cooling towers have the warm
water falling downward through fill material while
cooling air is drawn in horizontally at approximately
ninety degrees to the path of the falling water. These
cross flow cooling

plurality of elongate and substantially parallel gutter

portions (88), located under said fill material for
collecting said liquid from said fill material; and
at least one fan (38,40,42,44) located under said

(88) along its base for collecting the liquid running down

off the collection plate, said overlapping collection
plates covering said at least one fan; and in that
the base of said at least one layer (115) of fill
material is directly upon the top edges (114) of said
