<ABSTRACT>
A method of combating escape of hazardous material from a pipeline, for example in oil well blow-outs or in escape of dangerous chemicals, by introducing into the pipeline an inert fluid which is normally a gas, the fluid being introduced at a temperature lower than that of the escaping material and in a condition whereby the fluid expands on introduction, so as to cool and dilute the escaping material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Hazardous Materials ControlThis invention relates to a method of combating the issue of hazardous material from a pipeline, for example during a blow¬ out at an oil well or leakage of dangerous material from a chemical plant .Escape of hazardous material is a major danger in many industries and can result in widespread and expensive damage being caused.The problem is potentially worse if .the hazardous material is concentrated and/or under pressure.In general, previously-proposed methods of dealing with such escapes have been aimed at combating the hazardous mate'rial after its escape while attempting to cut off its source. Thus damage can be caused by the issuing material before the source can be isolated, as the material is treated only after its escape.According to the present invention there is provided a method of combating the issue of hazardous material from a pipeline, comprising providing the pipeline with a secondary inlet for introduction of a fluid inert to the hazardous material flowing in the pipeline, the fluid at normal temperature and pressure being a gas, and introducing said fluid into the pipeline through the secondary inlet, the introduction being made under conditions whereby the fluid expands and undergoes a temperature 

increase on introduction.Pressuring means may be provided for injecting the fluid into the pipeline. A valve may also be provided in association with the secondary inlet to allow the introduction of the fluid to be started, stopped and_ controlled as required.The method of this invention operates in general terms by treating the hazardous material prior to its escape from the pipeline. The treatment constitutes dilution by the inert fluid, and lowering of the hazardous material temperature and therefore, in many cases, its flash point. When a cryogenic fluid is employed the hazardous material may even be liquefied or solidified as a result of heat exchange with the fluid, thus making it easier to deal with. When it is solidified by the cryogenic fluid the solidified ma£erial can form a frozen plug in the pipeline, thus sεalingthe pipeline against further escape until the cause of the escape can be located and dealt with.The secondary inlet may be fed with any of a number of fluids depending on the particular hazard being presented by- he issuing material. For example, if the escaping material is inflammable the fluid selected would be incapable of supporting combustion, so that its * in ection into the pipeline would prevent ignition of the material or would

CLA I MS :
1. A method of combating the issue of hazardous material from a pipeline, comprising providing the pipeline with a secon¬ dary inlet for introduction of a fluid inert to the hazardous material flowing in the pipeline, the fluid at normal tempera¬ ture and pressure being a gas, and introducing said fluid into the pipeline through the secondary inlet, the introduction being made under conditions whereby the fluid expands and under¬ goes a temperature increase on introduction.
2. A method according to Claim 1, wherein the fluid is a flαwable particulate solid on introduction into the pipeline.
3. 'A method according to Claim 2, wherein the fluid is solid carbon dioxide.
4. A method according to Claim 1, wherein the fluid is a liquid on introduction into the pipeline.
5. A method according to Claim 4, wherein the fluid is selec¬ ted from liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, liquid neon, liquid argon, liquid krypton, liquid xenon and liquid carbon dioxide.
6. A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the fluid is incapable of supporting combustion.
7. A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, wherein the fluid is introduced to the secondary inlet through a valve.
8. A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, wherein the fluid is introduced into the pipeline at a temperature suf¬ ficiently low to change the state of the hazardous material.
9. A method according to Claim 8, wherein the injected fluid freezes the hazardous material to form a solid plug in the pipe¬ line preventing flow of the hazardous material through the pipe¬ line.
10. A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, wherein the fluid is passed in contact with the external face of the pipeline wall prior to introduction through the secondary inlet.
11. A method according to Claim 10, wherein the fluid is passed along an annular conduit whose inner wall is formed by
OMPI 


 the wall of the pipeline prior to introduction through the secondary inlet.
12. A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 11, wherein a proportion of the fluid is fed to a cooling unit in the form o f a passageway disposed within the pipeline in order to cool the hazardous material by heat exchange through the wall of the passageway.
13. A method according to Claim 12, wherein the passageway is annular .
14. A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 13, wherein the fluid is introduced into the pipeline between cooling units in which a proportion of the fluid is passed in heat exchange relationship through the wall of the pipeline with the hazar¬ dous material .
15. A method of combating the issue of hazardous material from a pipeline, substantially •as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
