<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns herbicidal sulfonamides, processes 
for their preparation, and compositions containing them. EP-A-363040 and WO-A-91/10653 each disclose herbicidal 
sulfonanilides related to those of the present invention. In one aspect, the invention provides novel sulfonamides 
of the formula : 
 
and salts thereof, where: 
A represents a substituted or unsubstituted benzene ring, 
or a 5-membered substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic 
ring; Q is a group of the formula -CXX'-; X and X', which may be same or different, are each 
hydrogen, halogen, cyano, an optionally-substituted alkyl 
group, or a group -ORa, -SRa, or -CORb, or one of X and X' is 
hydroxy and the other is as defined above, or X and X' together 
represent =O or =S; Ra is an optionally-substituted alkyl, aryl or acyl group; Rb is an otionally-substituted alkyl or aryl group, or a 
group -ORc or -NRcRd; Rc and Rd, which may be same or different, are each 
hydrogen or an optionally-substituted alkyl or aryl group; Y is nitrogen or a group CR9; R1 is an optionally-substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, 
cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, benzoheterocyclyl or amino 
group; R2 is hydrogen, an optionally-substituted alkyl or  
 
carboxylic acyl group, or a group -SO2R1; R3 and R4, which may be same or different, are each 
hydrogen, halo, an optionally-substituted alkyl, alkoxy, 
cycloalkyl or amino group, or an optionally-substituted 
heterocyclycl group; and R9 is hydrogen or an optionally-substituted alkyl group. When A is a 5-membered heteroaromatic ring, it is 
preferably a substituted or unsubstituted thiophene, furan 
pyrrole, thiazole, isothiazole, pyrazole, imidazole, oxazole or 
isoxazole ring. In the ring A, any substituent on a carbon atom therof is 
preferably halo, cyano, a group -COOR10, (where R10 represents 
hydrogen or an optionally-substituted alkyl group), or an 
optionally-substituted alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, heterocyclyloxy 
or amino group. Preferred such substituent groups are fluoro 
and chloro.  
 Any substituent on a nitrogen atom of the ring A is 
preferably a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy, 
amino or aryl group, especially a methyl group. Any alkyl group present in the molecule is preferably 
of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, especially of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, 
and particularly of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Specific 
preferred unsubstituted alkyl or alkyl-containing groups 
include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, 
t-butyl, methoxy, ethoxy and n-propoxy. When any alkyl group in the molecule is
