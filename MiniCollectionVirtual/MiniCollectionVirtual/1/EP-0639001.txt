<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for filtering a pulse signal comprises means for generating an output pulse CLKOUT upon detection of an input pulse CLKIN, the shape of this output pulse being based on elementary delays obtained by charging and discharging of capacitors. During the generation of the output pulse, no new input pulse can be taken into account.
