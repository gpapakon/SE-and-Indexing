<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a plasma applicator
(10) including a cylindrically-shaped outer tube (14),

a cylindrically-shaped plasma tube (12) located within
and concentric with the outer tube and having a first

end and a second end. A first support (24,30) located
at the first end of the plasma tube, a seal (42,44)

surrounding the plasma tube at its first end
compressed between the plasma tube and the first

support and located at a first distance from the first
end of the plasma tube, and a shield (32) extending a

second distance into the plasma tube to protect the
seal from being directly eradicated by the hostile

radiation that is generated by the plasma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to plasma
applicators.Plasma-based, excitation sources or plasma
applicators must often be able to handle high input powers
and withstand high temperatures combined with a highly
reactive chemical environment. For example, in a common
application of a plasma applicator, NF3 gas flows into the
applicator and is broken down by the plasma. The resulting
activated species flows out of the applicator and into the
semiconductor processing equipment where it is used for in-situ
chamber cleaning, etching, photo resist stripping, or
any of a number of other tasks. As an example of using the
reactive species for in-situ chamber cleaning refer to EP-A-0697467.The extremely hostile environment to which such
equipment is exposed can disable the plasma applicator very
quickly. For example, some applicators that are
commercially available use quartz tubes to contain the
activated species. In those systems, the fluorine that is
produced etches the tube quite quickly. Moreover, at high
power levels (e.g. above 1 kW) the quartz will tend to break
down. Thus, after using the applicator only a few times or
for a sustained period of operation, the wall of the tube
will become so thin that it will collapse under continued
exposure to the high temperatures and the vacuums that are
used in such systems. Thus, very early in the life of the
tube, it must be discarded and replaced with a new tube.
Both the inconvenience and cost of having to repeatedly 
replace the quartz tube can be quite high.Some existing plasma applicators use ceramic tubes
in place of the quartz tubes. Ceramic tubes are capable of
holding up better than the quartz tubes in the chemically
corrosive environments often encountered. But ceramic tubes
are not a panacea. They typically have a relatively high
thermal expansion coefficient as compared to quartz and
other materials. Thus, repeated cycling between room
temperature and the high processing temperatures that
commonly occur in these systems produces large stresses
within the ceramic tubes. These stresses eventually result
in the tubes cracking and failing.Some microwave plasma applicators have been
developed which use two concentric tubes, namely, an outer
tube and an inner tube both of which are made of materials
that are transparent to the microwave radiation, e.g. quartz
and sapphire. The inner tube contains the plasma and thus
is the tube that is exposed to the high temperature and
corrosive conditions. To cool the inner tube, water is
flowed through the annular region
