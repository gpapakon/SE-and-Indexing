<ABSTRACT>
A quick-cooking barley product can be cooked by 
hydrating in at least an equal volume of boiling water 

(typically 1:1.5 barley to water) for from 5 to 15 minutes 
followed by a 5 minute stand. It has a cooked texture, as 

measured by a shear press value of 70 to 95 lbs/force (31.75 
to 43.09 kg/force), preferably 75-90 lbs/force (34.02 to 

40.82 kg/force) and appearance similar to long cooking 
barley. The product can be prepared without any flattening 

or flaking of the barley. The process comprises: cooking 
pearled barley to raise the moisture content of the barley 

to 55 to 65%; subjecting the barley to an atmosphere of 
ambient-pressure, saturated steam while spraying hot water 

onto the barley in order to obtain a drained moisture of 
70%-80%; draining; and drying to a moisture content of about 

12% or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the provision of a barley 
product which can be rapidly prepared by the consumer 
with a minimum of cooking. Barley is a cereal grain (hordeum vulgare). It is 
the fourth largest cereal crop in the world and the 
oldest grain known to mankind. It is most often used as 
a feed for animals and in the production of malt 
beverages such as beer. As a source of human nutrition, 
it is potentially useful but infrequently used. 
Depending on the variety, it can be a good source of 
protein, complex carbohydrates, and soluble fiber. The preparation of barley for eating is a time-consuming 
and energy-intensive operation. 
Traditionally, barley has been prepared by a long-cooking 
procedure. Ordinarily, long-cooking entails 
soaking in water overnight and cooking in boiling water 
for from about 40 to about 60 minutes. The result is 
separate, integral grains with good texture and 
resistance to bite. There is a need to provide a quick-cooking 
barley product which substantially retains the 
desired characteristics of the long-cooking procedure.  The art has developed several procedures for 
preparing barley in a manner which would increase the 
ease of final cooking by the end user. However, each of 
the prior art procedures has at least one shortcoming. In U.S. Patents No. 2,890,957 and No. 2,944,904, 
Seltzer describes processing barley or rice to render 
them quick-cooking. The grains are soaked in water to 
hydrate without gelatinizing, steamed under pressure to 
gelatinize, compressed and finally dried. The barley 
prepared in this manner is physically deformed, yet 
still requires cooking for ten minutes for final 
preparation. In U.S. Patent No. 3,495,989, Lewis et al. describe 
the preparation of barley and a wide variety of other 
foods as quick-cooking foods. Their process entails 
soaking the barley in saline solution, tempering, 
gelatinizing in hot air, packaging and pasteurizing. 
Even though the product has a higher moisture than the 
unprocessed grain -- requiring vacuum packaging and 
pasteurizing -- it requires simmering for 12 minutes 
prior to serving. Takatsu et al., in U.S. Patent No. 3,914,454, 
disclose the treatment of various cereal foods, 
including barley, to make their final preparation 
easier. The disclosure calls for gelatinizing with 
pressurized steam, drying, and frying. The frying 
produces swelled, porous granules which must be deoiled 
prior to packaging. In U.S. Patent No. 4,707,371, Yamaguchi et al. 
describe the preparation of a microwavable

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a quick-cooking barley 
which can be cooked by boiling in at least an equal volume 

of boiling water followed by a 5 minute stand and which will 
have a cooked texture, as measured by a shear press value of 

from about 70 to about 95 lbs/force (about 31.75 to about 
43.09 kg/force) and appearance similar to long-cooking 

barley, after said long-cooking barley has been soaked for 
several hours and cooked in boiling water for a period of at 

least 40 minutes, for example for a period of from about 40 
to about 60 minutes, wherein the process does not include 

any flattening or flaking of the barley, said process 
comprising the steps of: 


(a) cooking hulled, medium- or fine-pearled 
barley in boiling or near-boiling water 

for a time effective to raise the moisture content 
of the barley to within the range of from about 55 

to about 65%; 
(b) separating the cooked barley from the hot 
water; 
(c) subjecting the barley to an atmosphere of 
ambient, saturated steam for from about 20 to about 

35 minutes while spraying hot water onto the 
barley, at least during the initial period of 

steaming, in order to obtain a drained moisture 
of from about 70 to about 80%; 
(d) draining the steamed barley from free and 
surface water; and 
(e) drying the drained barley with hot air 
having a temperature of about 320°-350°F (about 

160.0-176.7°C) over a time period of about 7-15 
minutes to obtain a moisture content of about 12% 

or less. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the cook 
water of step (c) is adjusted to a pH within the range of 

from about 4 to about 5. 
A process according to claim 2, wherein the pH is

A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the barley is cooked in a continuous, rotary cooker.

about 15 minutes followed by letting it stand in the water 
for about another 5 minutes. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the shear press value falls within the range of from 

about 75 to about 90 lbs/force (about 34.02 to about 40.82

temperature of from about 205° to about 210°F (about 96.1° 
to about 98.9°C). 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein the cooking of step (a) is from about 15 to about 40 

minutes. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
