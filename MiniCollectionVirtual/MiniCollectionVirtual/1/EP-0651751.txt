Family of porphin ring substances of the 
general formulas Ia and Ib below: 


 
in which: 


R
1
 is a methyl group or a CHO group; and 
R
4
 represents a hydrogen atom or a phytyl group; 
 
as products which are active on the skin, both 

cosmetically and dermatologically, which products 
are selected from among: 


didehydrochlorophyls of the formula Ib, 
in which R
1

3
 group 
(didehydrochlorophyll a) or a CHO group 

(didehydrochlorophyll b), and R
4
 represents a 
phytyl group; 
the didehydrochlorophylides of formula 
Ib, in which R
1
 has the same meaning as for the  
 

didehydrochlorophyls and R
4
 represents a hydrogen 
atom; 
the didehydrophaeophytines of formula 
Ia, in which R
1
 and R
4
 have the same meaning as in 
the case of the didehydrochlorophyles; and 
the didehydropheophorbides of formula 
Ia, in which R
1
 and R
4
 have the same meaning as for 
the didehydrochlorophylides. 
Process of obtaining all these substances 
with a porphinic ring of formula Ia and Ib 

according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises the following steps: 


(1) at least one cold maceration of 
parts of chlorophylous plants and in particular of 

freeze-dried cyanophytes in an anhydrous solvent, 
selected from among chloroform, methylene 

chloride, pure ethanol and pure methanol, to 
obtain an extract containing, at the same time, 

the didehydrochlorophyls, the 
didehydrochlorophylides, the 

didehydrophaeophorbides and the 
didehydrophaeophytines; and 
(2) chromatographic separation of the 
different substances in the presence of a polar 

solvent. 
Process according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the polar solvent is 

selected from acetone, methanol and ethanol which 
are aqueous to a greater or lesser extent. 
Process according to Claim 2 or Claim 3, 
characterised in that it comprises, before stage 

(1), a pretreatment of the chlorophylous plant, 
comprising at least one maceration of said fresh 

or previously freeze-dried plants in a solvent 
which is very slightly polar, and then the drying 

of said pretreated plants. 
Process according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the solvent which is very 

slightly polar is selected from among petroleum 
ether, cyclohexane, hexane and carbon 

tetrachloride. 
Process of specific separation of 
didehydrochlorophylides of formula Ib according to 

Claim 1, characterised in that it comprises: 

(1) at least one maceration of from 24 
hours to one week of the green parts of 

chlorophylous plants and in particular of freeze-dried 
cyanophytes in an aqueous solvent consisting 

of from 20 to 60% of water and of a solvent which 
is miscible in water, selected from among the  

 
group consisting of acetone, ethyl alcohol and 

methanol; 
(2) drying the plants which have been 
treated in this manner; 
(3) at least one cold maceration of the 
plants obtained in stage (2) in an anhydrous 

solvent, to obtain an extract essentially 
containing didehydrochlorophylides; and 
(4) chromatographic separation of 
didehydrochlorophylides. 
Process of specific separation of the 
didehydrophaophorbides of formula Ia according to 

Claim 1, characterised in that it comprises:

week at an ambient temperature of an extract of 

didehydrochlorophylide, according to Claim 6, in 
an organic solvent to which a miscible acid 

(formic acid, acetic acid or another acid of a 
concentration corresponding to a pH of between 2 

and 4, with reference to an aqueous solution) has 
been added; and 
(2) chromatographic separation of the 
didehydrophaeophorbides. 
Process of specific separation of the

particular of the freeze-dried cyanophytes, in a 

solvent which is miscible with water, such as 
acetone, to which there is added a miscible acid 

(formic acid, acetic acid or another acid of a

and 4, with reference to an aqueous solution); 
(2) drying the plants which have been 
treated in this manner; 
(3) at least one cold maceration of the
