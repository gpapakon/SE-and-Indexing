<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated thin film 
capacitor and a method for producing the same. Barium titanate (BiTaO3) having a perovskite crystal 
structure is widely used as a capacitor material since it is excellent 
in dielectric properties and has a high resistivity. Since barium 
titanate is characterized in that its dielectric constant in the a axis 
is larger than that in the c axis which is a polarization axis, it can 
provide a capacitor having good dielectric properties when its a axis 
is orientated preferentially in a direction perpendicular to a plane of 
an electrode, that is, in the (100) plane. Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) having a perovskite crystal 
structure is a cubic system crystal and paradielectric at a temperature 
of about 110 K or higher. While a ceramic comprising SrTiO3 
has a lower dielectric constant than a ceramic comprising BaTiO3 
having the same crystal structure, the former has better temperature 
characteristics and smaller dielectric loss than the latter. 
When a Curie temperature is shifted by the addition of a shifter such 
as barium to SrTiO3, a ceramic which is paradielectric and has a high 
dielectric constant at room temperature is obtained. This kind of 
ceramic is extensively used in a capacitor for high frequency and 
high voltage.  
 A composite perovskite structure compound having a 
composition of Pb[(Mg1/3Nb2/3)1-xTix] which is a composite material 
of Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3) being one of typical relaxation type ferrodielectric 
materials and lead titanate (PbTiO3) having the same perovskite 
crystal structure as BaTiO3 or SrTiO3 has a larger specific dielectric 
constant and better direct current bias characteristics than a BaTiO3 
type ferrodielectric material. Therefore, this composite perovskite 
structure compound is used in a small laminated capacitor having a 
large capacity. To accommodate a capacitor to miniaturization and high 
density loading of an electronic device, down-sizing and increase of 
capacity of a chip capacitor are being progressed. Increase of the 
capacity can be achieved by the use of a dielectric material having a 
large dielectric constant or increase of the number of laminated 
layers by making each dielectric layer thin. For example, a method 
for producing a laminated ceramic capacitor is described in 
Electronic Ceramics, No. 103 (1990) pages 57-61. The disclosed 
method for laminating dielectric layers and metal electrode layers is 
as follow: Powder of a dielectric material such as BaTiO3 is 
compounded, mixed and
