<ABSTRACT>
A coloring composition for image recording, which 
comprises a pigment and a resin, is disclosed. The pigment 

is a coating-clad pigment with a thin filmcoating of a 
hardened polymer substantially insoluble to dispersing 

medium and having a polar group. When used as colorant 
for a developer for image recording, the composition provides 

for sufficient improvement in the stability of development, 
shelf stability of dispersion, adjustment of toriboelectric 

charging, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image recording materials used 
for image recording, such as electrophotograpy, electrostatic 
printing, electrostatic recording, thermal transfer recording, 
ink jet recording, etc., and also coloring compositions used 
for the manufacture of such recording materials. More 
specifically, the invention concerns a coloring composition 
for image recording, which uses a pigment and a resin, 
and said pigment being with a thin film coating of a 
hardened polymer substantially insoluble to a dispersing 
medium and having a polar group and is improved in 
various properties such as charging property, heat resistance, 
stability of dispersion, stability of development, etc. Heretofore, various dyes and pigments have been used 
as coloring material for image recording, such as full color 
or monochromatic electrophotography, electrostatic printing, 
electrostatic recording, thermal transfer recording, ink jet 
recording, etc. Specifically, oil-soluble dyes, dispersing dyes 
and pigments are used for electrophotographic dry developers 
and thermal transfer ribbons, pigments are used for liquid 
developers for electrophotography, electrostatic printing,  
 
electrostatic recording, etc. and water-soluble dyes and 
pigments are used for inks for ink jet recording. The oil-soluble and dispersing dyes have high tinting 
strength because they can color resin media through 
dissolusion. However, they are inferior in such color fastness 
as the light resistance, solvent resistance and chemical 
resistance. The pigments are superior in these various color 
fastness properties. However, they have problems of charges 
due to their chemical structures and, in the case of 
dispersions, settling due to density difference. For example, 
with liquid developer for the electrophotographic or 
electrostatic recording system, the electric latent image is 
developed as electrically double layer development based 
on the charging of the contact surface of pigment particles 
with the solvent. This leads to an inconvenience that the 
positive and negative polarities and intensity of charge 
due to the chemical structures of pigments selected from 
the consideration of color hues fail to match the intended 
development system so that the pigments can not be used 
or the charge polarities and intensity vary with the 
pigments. Accordingly, charge controllers for liquid developer system 
are often added. These charge controllers are to provide 
charge to pigment particles in the developer, and usually 
resin
