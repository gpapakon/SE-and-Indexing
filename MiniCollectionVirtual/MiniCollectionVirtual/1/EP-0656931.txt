 BIODEGRADABLE TWO-CYCLE ENGINE OIL COMPOSITIONS AND ESTER BASE STOCKSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to two-cycle engine oil compositions and to ester base stocks which are components thereof. The compositions of the invention require no miscibility-enhancing solvents and are readily biodegradable.2. Description of the Related ArtThe two-cycle (two stroke) engine has gained considerable popularity as a power source for such devices as outboard motors, snow mobiles, mopeds and a variety of landscaping equipment, e.g., lawnmowers, chain saws, string trimmers and blowers. The widespread use of two-cycle engines is due primarily to their simple design and lightweight construction, their ability to provide high power output with quick starts at low temperature and their relatively low cost.Two-cycle engines are operated using a mixture of gasoline and a lubricant in prescribed proportions. The lubricant must provide satisfactory performance characteristics under severe operating conditions. Lubricants for two-cycle engines are generally composed of a mineral oil or synthetic base fluid, performance additive(s) and a solvent, ordinarily a relatively low boiling petroleum distillate, to enhance gasoline/lubricant miscibility.The technologies developed to date for reducing exhaust emissions from four-cycle car and truck engines have not been successfully adapted to two-cycle engines. Hence, there is growing public concern over the high levelsSUBSTITUTESHEET 

of hydrocarbon emissions from these small engines, as hydrocarbons do not readily biodegrade.The hydrocarbon emissions are a consequence of the basic design of the engine. Specifically, in the power stroke of a typical two-cycle engine, air, oil and fuel are drawn into the crank case as the combined charge is compressed in the space above the piston. In the exhaust stroke, the burnt gases are discharged through exhaust ports, and a fresh combustible charge is transferred from the crank case to the space above the piston. Because the exhaust ports open before and close after transfer of the fresh combustible charge occurs, as much as 20% of the fresh charge will be discharged unburnt with the exhaust. Consequently, hydrocarbon emissions far exceed the level of emissions from a comparable four-cycle engine.Water-cooled outboard motors exhaust directly into the water, giving rise to water pollution, whereas the other devices mentioned above, which are equipped with air- cooled two-cycle engines, produce
