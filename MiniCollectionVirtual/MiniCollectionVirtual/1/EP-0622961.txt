<ABSTRACT>
In a picture signal coding/decoding method and 
device, the compressibility and visual picture quality of 

the picture pattern whose inter-field correlation of high 
frequency decreases and inter-field correlation of low 

frequency remains by slow movements are improved and 
transmitted. The intra-field component separate coding is 

performed in each field on first and second fields of the 
picture signal (S21) and by preventing the effect of inter-field 

movement in advance, the dropping of compressibility 
by the movement is avoided and furthermore, new blocks are 

constructed by the resultant low frequency components 
(S24, S25) of the two fields. Since it is so arranged that 

the component separate coding is performed in the frame, 
low frequency components which are not easily affected by 

slow movement can be coded efficiently, and as a result, 
the compressibility for pictures containing slow movements 

can be increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to picture signal 
coding/decoding methods and picture signal coding/decoding 
devices which may be suitable for transmitting picture 
signals such as by component separate coding. Heretofore, in a picture signal transmission system 
for transmitting picture signals remotely over a distance, 
such as in a television conference system, and in a device 
for recording and reproducing picture signals on a video 
tape recorder and/or video disc recorder, by effectively 
coding significant information in utilizing the correlation 
of digitalized picture signals in order to use the 
transmitting and recording medium effectively, the amounts 
of transmitted or recorded information have been decreased 
and the transmitting or recording efficiency have been 
improved. It is known to utilize the correlation of picture 
signals in methods of quantizing and transmitting upon 
separating the picture signal into multiple components, 
such as predictive coding methods and orthogonal transform 
coding systems such as DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), 
sub-band coding systems and Wavelet transform systems.  The predictive coding method is easily installed and 
suitable for coding of fairly low compressibility. 
However, it has a weak point in that worsening of picture 
quality is apt to be detected when the compressibility is 
increased. Also, the orthogonal transform coding system, 
such as DCT, is widely used since high picture quality can 
be obtained relatively easily with high compressibility. 
However, there are weak points in that noticeable 
distortion occurs on the border of blocks and the fact that 
the degree of distortion is different in each block is 
noticeable. Furthermore, in the orthogonal transform 
coding system with DCT, a large amount of calculation 
becomes an obstacle for hardware in practice. Furthermore, component separate coding, such as the 
sub-band coding system and Wavelet transform  
 
system, performs quantization after separating picture 
signal into multiple components, and relatively high 
compressibility can be obtained and there are few cases 
such peculiar distortion occurs. The installation 
process differs according to the method, but there is 
the method, such as, Wavelet transform using Haar 
function, which can be easily constructed. Wavelet transform method performs component 
separation recurrently on low frequency components and 
performs coding on the resultant components i.e., in 
conformity to its characteristics in each coefficient.
