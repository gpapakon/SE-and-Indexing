<ABSTRACT>
A device for transmitting torque between two rotatable, coaxial 
shaft members (1, 2) in a stationary housing (4) has 

a clutch (11, 12) engageable to counteract differential rotational 
speed between the shaft members. A hydraulic 

clutch piston (14) is arranged to engage the clutch, and a 
hydraulic pump arrangement (1', 18 - 21, 11'', 14 - 17), 

driven by the speed differential between the two shaft members, 
creates a hydraulic pressure on the clutch piston. 

The hydraulic pump arrangement includes a supply piston 
(18) and the clutch piston. Rollers (17, 21) are rotatable 

with one of the shaft members (2) and engage the other of 
the shaft members (1) via cams (1', 11''), which are angularly 

offset in relation to each other, so as to impart to 
the pistons a reciprocating movement at the differential 

rotational speed between the shaft members. A hydraulic 
line system (25, 27, 29, 31) connects a cylinder (23) at 

the supply piston on one hand with the tank (24) via a 
check valve (26) and on the other hand - via a line (27) 

with a check valve (28) - with an outlet line (31) and connects 
a cylinder (30) at the clutch piston (14) with the 

outlet line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for transmitting 
torque between two rotatable, coaxial shaft members in a 
stationary housing, the device containing a number of 
alternate clutch discs connected to the two shaft members 
and engageable to counteract differential rotational speed 
between the shaft members, at least one hydraulic clutch 
piston to engage the clutch discs, and a hydraulic pump 
arrangement, driven by a speed differential between the two 
shaft members to create a hydraulic pressure on the clutch 
piston. Devices for transmitting torque between two rotatable 
shafts are known from numerous patent publications, one 
good example being US-A-3 987 689, where the two shafts are 
the output shafts of a vehicle differential mechanism. The 
device may accordingly in this case be called a differential 
brake. There may, however, be other instances when it 
is desired to counteract a certain rotational speed differential 
between two shafts, a typical example being the two 
shafts to the driven front and rear axle, respectively, of 
a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Whereas the above-mentioned patent publication shows a 
"speed-sensitive differential mechanism" and the present 
invention is applied to the more general case with two axially 
aligned shafts, the same general considerations apply. Although US-A-3 987 689 has been taken as an example 
of the prior art above, there are many other publications 
suggesting solutions to the problem of decreasing undesired 
rotational speed differential between two shafts, such as  
 
EP-A-0 350 044, EP-B-0 368 893, US-A-4 012 968, US-A-3 488 
980 and US-A-5 087 228. In a copending patent application from the applicant 
(SE 9202200-3) a device as defined above is shown. Here the 
hydraulic clutch piston as well as the entire hydraulic 
pump arrangement are placed in the stationary housing, 
which gives considerable advantages. However, a possible 
drawback with the device shown therein is that the hydraulic 
flow and thus the pressure to the clutch piston from 
the hydraulic pump arrangement fluctuates during each operation 
cycle or differential rotation between the two shaft 
members. The main object of the present invention is accordingly 
to obviate the drawback in a device with the hydraulic 
clutch piston and the hydraulic pump arrangement in the 
stationary housing that the pressure on the clutch piston 
fluctuates during one differential rotation between the two 
shaft members. A similar object has been attained in a way which is 
described in GB-A-2
