<ABSTRACT>
A heat-shielded spark plug boot assembly 
(10) for an ignition cable connector (16) comprises an 

L-shaped tubular, elastomeric boot (12) having a cable 
end portion (40) for receiving an ignition cable (14), 

a seal end portion (44) for receiving a spark plug 
(22) and sealing around its outer insulated part (28), 

and an intermediate cavity portion (42) for housing a 
terminal (16) for connection with the spark plug (22). 

An L-shaped heat shield (20) is stamped from flat 
sheet-metal stock and is then bent and formed to 

provide a pair of spaced-apart, generally parallel 
L-shaped sides (50,52), a top side (54) having an 

inwardly-indented semi-circular upper end (56) and 
with the sides (50,52) at the upper ends (50a,52a) 

thereof being rolled on the semi-circular upper end 
(56) of the top side (54) and towards and into 

engagement with each other to form a semi-circle (70) 
and a longitudinal seam (72) at the free edges 

thereof. The upper portion (50a) of one side (50) has 
a tab (80) whose free end is received within a 

complementary-shaped recess (82) of the other upper 
end (52a) of the other side (52) so as to interlock 

the two sides (50,52) together. The boot (12) is 
assembled to the heat shield (20) by press-fitting the 

boot (12) therein through an open side of the shield 
(20) and snapping the boot (12) past a pair of indents 

(90) on the sides (50,52) of the heat shield (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ignition 
cable connector assembly, and more particularly, to an 
ignition cable connector assembly having an L-shaped 
elastomeric boot for housing an ignition terminal and 
a metal heat shield surrounding the boot and which is 
adapted to be electrically grounded to a metal shell 
of a spark plug, according to the preamble of claim 1, and as disclosed in US-A-3965879. Ignition cable connector assemblies commonly 
comprise a tubular elastomeric boot having a cable end 
portion for receiving an ignition cable, an 
intermediate cavity portion for housing a terminal 
which is secured to one end of the ignition cable and 
a seal end portion for receiving a spark plug and 
sealing around its outer insulator part. These 
elastomeric boots can either be linear in which the 
cable end and seal end portions thereof are aligned or 
be formed so that the cable end portion and seal end 
portion are either angled or at right angles to each 
other so as to be L-shaped. Whilst these ignition cable connector 
assemblies have been highly successful in use, they 
can deteriorate or have a shortened useful life when 
exposed to very high operating temperatures in an 
engine compartment, since they are often located near 
the engine exhaust manifold or other hot spots in the 
engine compartment. This is true even when 
high-temperature elastomers, such as silicone are 
used. In such applications, the temperature 
capability of an elastomeric boot can be increased by 
the use of a metal heat shield which dissipates heat 
from any close hot spots in the engine compartment and 
tends to uniformly distribute the heat around the 
elastomeric boot. These metal heat shields also 
contact the metal bases of spark plug to transfer heat  
 
to the massive and cooler engine block to enhance heat 
shielding effectiveness. Examples of such heat shields are shown in 
US Patent Nos 4,497,532; 4,671,586 and 5,163,838, all 
of which are assigned to the applicants. The heat 
shields disclosed in these US patents are cylindrical 
and surround the linear elastomeric boots containing a 
spark plug connector terminal and they are 
electrically grounded to a metal shell of the spark 
plug. In these heat shields, the ignition cable boots 
are merely inserted into the heat shield. It is also known to provide metal shields 
which are L-shaped tubes or elbows, such as those 
shown in US Patent Nos 1,988,859, and 2,301,572. 
These metal elbow heat shields cannot, however, be 
used with a preformed L-shape

A heat-shielded, spark plug boot 
assembly (10) for an ignition cable connector, said 

assembly (10) comprising: an L-shaped, tubular 
elastomeric boot (12) having a cable end portion (40) 

for receiving an ignition cable (14), a seal end 
portion (44) for receiving a spark plug (22) and 

sealing around its outer insulator part (28), and an 
intermediate cavity portion (42) for housing a 

terminal (16) having one end (16a) secured to one end 
of the ignition cable and its other end (16b) 

connectable to a terminal (26) on said spark plug 
(22); and a heat shield (20) surrounding said 

elastomeric boot (12), said heat 
shield (20) being an L-shaped heat shield (20) mounted on 

said elastomeric boot (12) characterised in that said heat shield (20) surrounds said 
elastomeric boot (12) for approximately 270Â° of its 

circumference, said heat shield (20) is stamped 
from flat sheet-metal stock and is then bent and 

formed to provide a pair of spaced-apart, generally
