<ABSTRACT>
A bulb socket mounted on a partition wall of a lamp 
house through an elastic gasket, for receiving a bulb and 

electric terminals, comprises a front casing and a rear 
casing. The front casing (1) which is receiving a proximal end 

portion of the bulb has engagement projections (14) on an outer 
periphery thereof. The rear casing (2) has a mounting flange (22) on 

an outer periphery thereof for holding the partition wall (21) of 
the lamp house with the engagement projections (14) of the front 

casing. The rear casing (2) is molded separately from the front 
casing (1) by a mold which allows the rear casing (2) to be removed 

therefrom in an axial direction. The front casing (1) and the 
rear casing (2) are integrally joined at their open end surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bulb socket for being
attached to a lamp house.As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, a socket casing 50 of a
conventional bulb socket according to the first part of claim 1 is integrally molded of a resin, and
includes a tubular socket portion 51 for receiving a bulb,
and a tubular connector portion 52 extending from this socket
portion.An outwardly-extending, mounting flange 53 of a
larger diameter is formed on an outer peripheral surface of
the socket casing 50 at the boundary between the socket
portion 51 and the connector portion 52. And engagement
projections 54 are formed on the outer peripheral surface of
the socket portion. A plate-like finger support 56 is formed
on and projected from the outer peripheral surface of the
connector portion 52.For attaching the bulb socket of this construction to
a lamp house, the socket portion 51 is passed through a
mounting hole 61 formed through a partition wall 60 of the
lamp house, with a gasket 62 of an elastic material
interposed between the mounting side of the mounting flange
53 and the partition wall, thus compressing the gasket 62 
hard, and in this condition the socket is turned by putting
the finger on the finger support portion 56, so that the
partition wall 60 is held between the engagement projections
54 and the partition wall 60. The gasket 62 is elastically
pressed against the partition wall 60 and the mounting flange
53, thereby imparting waterproofness to the interior of the
lamp house.The mounting flange 53, extending over the entire
circumference, and the plurality of engagement projections 54
need to be formed on the outer periphery of this conventional
socket casing in axially spaced relation to each other.
Therefore, it is difficult to remove the socket casing 50
from a mold in the axial direction, and therefore the socket
casing is molded by a molding method in which the socket
casing is removed from the mold in a direction perpendicular
to the axis thereof, which mold can be split into halves in
the axial direction.As a result, as shown in an exaggerated manner in
Figs. 5 and 6, axially-extending, linear protuberances,
called parting lines P, are formed respectively on upper and
lower portions of the outer periphery of the socket casing
50. These raised parting lines P extend across a press
surface of the mounting flange 53 which is pressed against
the gasket 62, and therefore the gasket 62 can not be held in
intimate contact with the mounting flange along the parting
lines P, thus inviting a problem that the sealing

<CLAIMS>
A bulb socket mountable on a partition wall (60) of a lamp house through an
elastic gasket (62), for receiving a bulb and electrical terminals, said bulb

socket comprising: a front casing (1) for receiving a proximal end portion of
the bulb, said front casing (1) having engagement projections (14) on an outer

periphery of said front casing (1) and a J-slot (13) formed in an inner surface of
said front casing (1), said J-slot (13) being defined by an insertion groove (13a)

and an engagement groove (13b) which axially linearly extend
in offset relation to each

other, said J-slot (13) for receiving a mounting pin projected from an outer
periphery of the bulb in said J-slot (13) and for retainingly engaging the

mounting pin; and a rear casing (2) having a mounting flange (22) on an outer

periphery of said rear casing (2), said mounting flange (22) shaped to hold the
partition wall (60) of the lamp house with said engagement projections (14) of

said front casing (1),

characterised in that

said front casing (1) is molded separately from said rear casing (2) such that
said J-slot (13) the insertion groove (13a) and the engagement groove (13b) of which extending respectively from left and right open ends of said front casing (1) allows said front casing (1) a removal from molds in an axial

direction, and that a parting line (P) between the molds is formed perpendicular
to the axial direction; and said front casing (1)

and said rear casing (2),
being integrally joined at open end surfaces (22a)

by welding
after molding, said front casing (1) and said rear

casing (2) jointly forming said bulb socket.
Bulb socket according to claim 1, characterised by feeder terminals mounted in
said tubular front casing (1) and in said tubular rear casing (2), said feeder 

terminals feeding electric power to said bulb, wherein said rear casing (2) is
molded (2) separately from said front casing (1) by a mold which allows said rear

casing (2) to be removed therefrom in an axial direction.
Bulb socket according to claim 1 or 2, characterised by said J-slot, which is
defined by said insertion groove (13a) and said engagement groove (13b) in

such an offset relation that an offset portion between said insertion groove
(13a) and said engagement groove (13b) provides a retaining portion (13c)

extending perpendicularly from said insertion groove (13a) and said
engagement groove (13b), for receiving a mounting pin projected from an outer

periphery of said bulb wherein the bulb is turned so as to retainingly engage
said mounting pin in said J-slot (13).
