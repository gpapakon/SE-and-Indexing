A circuit and method for controlling a 
switching voltage regulator having (1) a switch 

including one or more switching transistors and (2) an 
output adapted to supply current at a regulated voltage 

to a load including an output capacitor. The circuit 
and method generates a control signal to turn said one 

or more switching transistors OFF under operating 
conditions when the voltage at the output is capable of 

being maintained substantially at the regulated voltage 
by the charge on the output capacitor. Such a circuit 

and method increases the efficiency of the regulator 
circuit particularly at low average current levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switching regulator circuit. More particularly, the present invention relates to a control circuit for maintaining high efficiency over broad current ranges in a switching regulator circuit.The purpose of a voltage regulator is to provide a predetermined and constant output voltage to a load from a poorly-specified and fluctuating input voltage source. Generally, there are two different types of regulators: series regulators and switching regulators.The series regulator employs a pass element (e.g., a power transistor) coupled in series with a load and controls the voltage drop across the pass element in order to regulate the voltage which appears at the load. In contrast, the switching regulator employs a switch (e.g., a power transistor) coupled either in series or parallel with the load. The regulator controls the turning ON and turning OFF of the switch in order to regulate the flow of power to the load. The switching regulator employs inductive energy storage elements to convert the switched current pulses into a steady load current. Thus, power in a switching regulator is transmitted across the switch in discrete current pulses, whereas in a series regulator, power is transmitted across the pass element as a steady current flow. A similar switching regulator is disclosed in US-A-5 097 196.In order to generate a stream of current pulses, switching regulators typically include control circuitry to turn the switch on and off. The switch duty cycle, which controls the flow of power to the load, can be varied by a variety of methods. For example, the duty cycle can be varied by either (1) fixing the pulse stream frequency and varying the ON or OFF time of each pulse, or (2) fixing the ON or OFF time of each pulse and varying the pulse stream frequency.Which ever method is used to control the duty cycle, switching regulators are generally more efficient than series regulators. In series regulators, the pass element is generally operated in its linear region where the pass element conducts current continuously. This results in the continuous dissipation of power in the pass transistor. In contrast, in switching regulators, the switch is either OFF, where no power is dissipated by the switch, or ON in a low impedance state, where a small amount of power is dissipated by the switch. This difference in operation generally results in reduced amounts of average power dissipation in switching regulators.The above difference in efficiency can be more apparent when there is a
