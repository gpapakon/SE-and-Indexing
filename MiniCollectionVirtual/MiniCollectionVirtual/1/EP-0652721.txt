<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a bag-holder (4) to be fastened on an extraction apparatus (1), said bag-holder including a handle (5), an open housing for the bag and a flow region (3) for the coffee. The housing includes, above the flow region, means (7) for holding th bag by its lower section, and serrations (9) on the flow grid (10) to facilitate the tearing of at least one of the two faces of the bag (8). The extraction apparatus comprises at least one injection needle (11) for the extraction fluid, which enters the bag at the flow grid of the bag-holder as well as a complementary section (12) provided for closing the bag housing when the bag-holder is being installed.

Process for extracting sealed flexible bags (8), 
containing at least one substance for the preparation of a 

beverage, the said bag in the shape of a tetrahedron 
possessing one longitudinal weld (22) and two transverse 

welds (20, 21), wherein the bag is placed in a bag-holder 
(4) comprising a handle for gripping (5) and a housing (13) 

for the said bag, this bag is clamped in its welded region 
towards the bottom of the housing of the said bag-holder 

(4), the bag/bag-holder assembly is placed in an extraction 
machine (1), the said bag is perforated at its lower part 

above the transverse weld area with a needle (11), a 
mixture of air and water at a pressure of between 0.5 and 

10 bar is injected by means of the said needle into the 
upper part of
 the bag, at least one of the lower faces of 
the bag is torn against raised and indented areas (9) of an 

extraction device under the effect of pressure, and the 
extract which passes completely through the bed of the 

substance is then collected via openings made in the lower 
part of the bag. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the tears obtained on the lower faces as the pressure rises 

during extraction have been previously initiated when 
placing the bag (8) in the bag-holder (4). 
Process according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the bag/bag-holder assembly is put in 

place in the extraction machine (1) and the said bag is 
perforated at its lower part in a simultaneous or 

consecutive manner. 
Device capable of being used for implementing the 
process according to one of claims 1 to 3, consisting of a 

bag-holder (4) designed to be fixed to an extraction 
machine (1), the said bag-holder comprising a handle (5),  

 
an open housing for the tetrahedral-shaped bag and an 

outflow region for the coffee, the said housing (13) 
comprising, above the outflow zone, means (7) for holding 

the bag by its lower part and raised and indented elements 
(9) on an outflow mesh (10) for promoting tearing of at 

least one of the two faces of the said bag, and the 
extraction machine comprising a needle (11) for injecting 

the extraction fluid, this needle being designed to 
penetrate the bag in the region of the outflow mesh of the 

bag-holder, and a complementary part (12) enabling the 
housing for the bag to be sealed when the bag-holder is put 

in place. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
means (7) for holding the bag in the bag-holder consists of 

a clamp which may possibly be operated by a trigger (6) 
arranged in the handle of the bag-holder. 
Device according to one of claims 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the bag-holder (4) and the extraction 

machine (1) form a water-tight assembly.
