<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement is specified in which a binary word is asynchronously transmitted in an optical signal and which is represented by high and low intensity levels is supplied to a plurality of optical inverting devices; the optical signals output by the inverting devices, which have mutually different wavelengths, are supplied as aggregate signal to a wave-length-selective delay device; when the desired binary word is present, the individual binary characters at the input of a detection device become superimposed to form an intensity level which is lower than a high intensity level caused by a single inverting device. Other embodiments relate to the changeability of the wavelength of the optical signals output by the inverting devices and the double inversion of the optical signal in individual signal branches.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for evaluating binary words which
are transmitted asynchronously and serially in an

optical signal and which have a combination of binary
elements represented by high or low intensity levels,

characterized in that

the optical signal (λ0) is applied to a plurality of
optical inversion means (AINV1 ... AINVm) on the input

side,
the optical signals output by the optical inversion
means on the output side have different wavelengths

(λ1 ... λn) from one another,
the optical signals output by the optical inversion
means are supplied to a summing means (KOP),
the output of the summing means is connected to the
input of a wavelength-selective delay line (VL),
the output of the delay line is connected to the input
of a detection means (DET),
the detection means only outputs a significant output
signal if the intensity level of the summed optical

signals at its input is lower than the intensity level
caused by a single inversion means.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the wavelength of the signals output by the

inversion means is variable.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that an additional inversion

means is inserted in each case into the signal path of
single inversion means.
