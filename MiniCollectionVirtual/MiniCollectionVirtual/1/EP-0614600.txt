<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a loudspeaker comprising a loudspeaker casing (1), a diaphragm (2), which is attached by its edges to the loudspeaker casing and possesses a front surface (2') facing the listener and a rear surface (2'') facing the loudspeaker casing (1), and a controller (3) associated with the diaphragm (2) and arranged to transform the electric signal conducted to it into a movement of the diaphragm (2) for producing a sound corresponding to the signal. The diaphragm (2) has a first area (4) adjacent to the controller (3) such that it is more elastic and/or more flexible than a second area (5) lying outside said first area (4) so that the movement of the controller (3) is communicated to a movement of the second area (5) of the diaphragm (2) via the said first area. The front surface (2') of the diaphragm (2) is essentially a plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a loudspeaker according to the 
ingress part of claim 1. It is common for the diaphragm of the loudspeaker element 
to consist of a stiff cardboard cone, for example. The 
outer edge of the diaphragm is flexibly attached to the 
framework cf the element and the voice coil, moving in a 
magnetic field, is fixed in the centre of the cone. 
Nowadays the conical diaphragm is frequently manufactured 
of plastic, fibre or even aluminium. The suspension of the 
cone is realized by means of corrugations on its external 
edge or a rubber moulding glued to that edge and by a 
flexible support, or 'spider' attached to the voice coil. 
A conical loudspeaker can produce distortion caused by 
buckling strains arising in the diaphragm and by pressure 
foci. There are also designs which employ a planar diaphragm 
attached to the edge of the loudspeaker casing. Such a 
design is presented in the patent publication US 
3,509,290. The planar diaphragm is manufactured of 
expanded polystyrene or some other comparable plastic 
material. The diaphragm then has a number of controllers 
connected with it, each for its own frequency range. The 
controller in the centre of the diaphragm typically 
produces the bass frequencies and one at the edge the 
higher frequencies. The disadvantage of this design is 
that several controllers have to be used for different 
sound frequency ranges and a distribution filter to divide 
the incoming signal between them. The use of a number of 
controllers with one diaphragm causes mixing between them, 
which is manifested in distortion. The patent publication US-A-3,586,121 presents a loudspeaker  
 
diaphragm which is thinner at the centre than in the surrounding 
areas. This diaphragm has a front surface which is essentially 
of the form of a truncated cone. The controller is attached to 
the central area of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is manufactured 
of a foamed plastic such as polystyrene and is typically 2-3 mm 
thick at the centre and varies in the range 3-7 mm in the 
surrounding areas. The purpose of the attenuated concave area on 
the front surface is to improve the poor sound reproduction at 
high frequencies known to be experienced with planar diaphragms 
made of a foamed plastic. The drawback with this loudspeaker is 
that the truncated cone of the front surface behaves essentially 
in the same manner as a conical loudspeaker. The patent publication US-A-1,863,072 discloses a loudspeaker 
diaphragm which possesses a circular centre part and a first 
annular
