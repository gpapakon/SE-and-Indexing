<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates
to the provision of novel interlocking thermoplastic
structural components which can be mass produced at low
cost and which can be quickly and easily interlocked
together to erect a wide range of structures which will
require minimal maintenance and will be safe from termites,
corrosion, rust or rot and will be highly resistant to the
effects of weathering.Further, the invention relates to the provision
of such novel structural components which include hollow
components adapted to accept concrete or other material
therein to enable a structure erected therefrom to be
anchored to a base and converted into a permanent and
essentially indestructible structure which will withstand
earthquakes, tornadoes and other natural phenomena. The
invention also relates to the method of producing such
components.While the structural components of the invention
can be used in the erection of a wide range of structures,
it is of particular note that their existence now enables
low cost durable or permanent housing to be provided for 
the masses throughout the word regardless of the climatic
conditions. While the use of plastic to form wall panels or
the like for use in building construction has been
proposed, such panels have not had the necessary load
bearing or other structural requirements to form practical
structures which could be mass produced at low cost and
quickly easily assembled to erect durable low cost
structures and, in particular, low cost housing.U.S. Patent 3,992,839, for instance, discloses a
plastic panel fabricated from separate panel members,
preferably formed of polyvinyl chloride which snap together
to form a thin wall panel. The panels in turn are formec
to snap together to provide a wall structure. Such
fabricated panels are inherently weak and lack the strength
and load bearing capacity to form adequate structural
components for use for instance in the forming of the
walls and roof of a practical durable building.U.S. Patent 3,662,507 discloses the use of
tongue and grooved individually prefabricated panels said
to be preferably of plastic which are bonded or glued
together and used particularly for the forming of basement
walls. Such panels do not permit of high speed production
and are not capable of being quickly and easily interlocked
together in the erection of a house or other structure.U.S. Patent No. 4 557,091 discloses a hollow
panel member having a width of about one and one-half
inches (38.1 mm) and a complicated interior formed by
pultrusion, a process involving
