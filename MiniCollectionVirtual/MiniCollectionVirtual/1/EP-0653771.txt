A safety switch comprising a housing (1, 8) in which a contact-bearing
switching push rod (2) is mounted reciprocably in a sprung

condition, which push rod is actuable by a rotatably mounted switching
wheel (5) which in turn is rotatable by an actuator (4) of adapted

configuration for switch actuation and for which engagement openings (10)
are provided in the housing (8) on two sides, wherein the switching wheel

is lockable on its two sides in its rotary movement by locking devices
(12, 13) which are subjected to a spring force and which are movable with

the adapted actuator (4) against the spring force into a position of
releasing the switching wheel for the rotary movement and the locking

devices each comprise two components (12, 13) which are coupled for
movement and which are arranged displaceably radially with respect to the

axis of rotation (7) of the switching wheel characterised in that arranged
displaceably in the switching wheel (5) on each side of the switching

wheel are two locking portions (12, 13) which act independently of each
other but which are coupled together for movement and which are each

associated in angularly displaced relationship with each other with a
respective one of the engagement openings (10) and have blocking pins (16)

which co-operate with the surrounding housing regions (8, 18).
A safety switch according to claim 1 characterised in that
associated with each locking portion (12, 13) is its own return spring

(15).
A safety switch according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in
that after unlocking by means of the actuator (4), irrespective of the

choice of engagement openings (10), the switching wheel (5) is always
rotatable in the same direction for actuation of the switching push rod (2)

from an initial position.
A safety switch according to claim 3 characterised in that the
initial position of the switching wheel (5) is additionally secured by an

abutment (32) which is operative in a direction of rotary movement of the
switching wheel. 
A safety switch according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that provided in the outside periphery of the switching

wheel (5) is a guide groove (31) into which a leg portion (33) provided on
the adjoining housing (8) engages for guiding the rotary movement of the

switching wheel and the one end of the guide groove (31) forms an abutment
for the initial position of the switching wheel (5).
A safety switch according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that surface portions (19, 36) of the locking portions

(12, 13), which surface portions co-operate with the adapted actuator (4,
34, 35), are disposed in spatially displaced set-back relationship with

respect to the surface portions (6) of the switching wheel (5), which co-operate
with the actuator (4).
A safety switch according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the switching wheel (5) with its locking portions

(12, 13) and its axis of rotation (7) is arranged in a housing cap (8)
which can be connected to the switch housing (1) in a position of being

respectively displaced through 180Â°.
A safety switch according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that provided in the two outside faces of the switching

wheel (5) are pockets (14) arranged cross-wise for receiving the
respective two locking portions (12, 13) which are coupled for movement,

in which pockets is arranged at least one return spring (15) for the pair

of locking portions and in which the locking portions (12, 13) are guided
displaceably radially relative to the axis of rotation (17), wherein

provided in the adjoining peripheral region of the switching wheel are
through bores (17) for the blocking pins (16) of the locking portions (12,

13).
A safety switch according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that a peripheral recess (28) of shallow depth for the

switching push rod (2) is formed in the central region of the switching 
wheel (5) at its outside periphery and also provided in angularly

displaced relationship thereto is a further peripheral recess (30) of
markedly greater depth, wherein the two peripheral recesses (28, 30) are

connected together by way of a control cam (29).
A safety switch according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the two co-operating locking portions (12, 13) each

have at outwardly disposed positions engagement projections (19) having
end face portions (36) for co-operating with the actuator (4).
A safety switch according to claims 6 and 10 characterised in
that the end faces (36) of the engagement projections (19) are disposed in

spatially displaced set-back relationship with respect to radial grooves
(6) of the switching wheel (5) and the actuator (4), besides a transverse

bar (34) for engagement into the radial grooves (6) of the switching wheel
(5), has lateral switching portions (35) which can act on the end faces

(36) of the engagement projections (19).
A safety switch according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that the one locking portion (12) has a fork portion (20)

into which engages a leg portion (21) of the other locking portion (13),
wherein provided on the leg portion (21) is a projecting inclined portion

(22) co-operating with an inclined surface (23) at the bottom of the fork
portion (20) of the locking portion (12) while provided on the fork arms

of the fork portion (20) of the locking portion (12) are projecting
inclined portions (24) co-operating with sliding inclined portions (26) under a

head portion (25) of the locking portion (13).
A safety switch according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that formed in the locking portions (12, 13) are

respective slots of defined length, through which the axis of rotation (7)
of the switching wheel (5) passes when the locking portions (12, 13) are

fitted one into the other. 
A safety switch according to claim 1 or claim 7 characterised in
that the respective engagement opening (10) which is not needed is

sealingly closed.
A safety switch according to claim 1 or claim 6 characterised by
a loop-shaped actuator (4) with a transverse bar (34) and front switching

portions (35), which is contoured without points and sharp edges.
