<ABSTRACT>
A method for detecting the presence of a particular organism, infectious agent, or component of a cell or organism in a biological sample. A polynucleotide probe capable of hybridizing to an analyte polynucleotide belonging to the organism, infectious agent, or cellular component is bound to a solid support, such as a microtiter well, thereby forming a solid support-polynucleotide structure. A second, labeled polynucleotide probe is then hybridized to this support-polynucleotide structure. Alternative embodiments make use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction. Also included in the present invention are polynucleotide probes and primers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GENE DETECTION SYSTEMField of the Invention The present invention relates to methods for detecting the presence of an organism or a member of a group of organisms in a biological sample by probing the sample for polynucleotides indicative of the presence of such organisms. The present invention also relates to methods for detecting the presence of other infectious agents or biological components in a biological sample which comprises polynucleotides. Background of the InventionAt the present time, the identity of an organism or infeclious agent suspected of infecting a subject is normally determined by culturing a sample of biological material from the subject. For example, if it is suspected that a subject is suffering from an infection of the lung caused by the fungus Candida albicans, a sputum sample can be cultured. After a period of lime, the culture is visually observed, and if a fungus grows in the culture in numbers sufficient to indicate a fungal infection, that fungus is identified by observing its morphological characteristics.This method of confirming a diagnosis, however, has serious drawbacks. For example, it requires that the biological sample be cultured for a long enough period of time to allow a detectable amount of the organism to grow. This method also requires that the cultured sample be inspected by a technician trained in identifying different varieties of organisms. There is therefore a great need for an assay which can quickly and specifically identify an organism or infectious agent or a group of organisms or infectious agents. An assay which does not require a great deal of training to perform and interpret would also be advantageous.There is also a need for an improved method for identifying other biological components present in a biological sample, where such components comprise polynucleotides or where the presence of such components is indicated by the presence of a polynucleotide. Present methods for detecting polynucleotides in a cell or tissue sample, such as the Norther blot method, require a relatively large amount of starting material. The Norther blot method is a widely accepted method of detecting specific genes (Sambrook J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., pp. 7.39-7.52) (hereinafter "Molecular Cloning"), and has been adapted for detecting cellular components such as jun oncogenes(Sherman, et al., Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:5663-5666 (1990); Oursler MJ et al., Proc. Natl. Acaά. Sci. USA, 88:6613-6617 (199])). In this method. mRNA is
