<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a concreting device with a rotary column (16) pivotable on a chassis (10) about a vertical axis (14), a distribution mast (18) pivotable about a horizontal axis (20) on the rotary column (16) and having at least two extended pole arms (24, 24', 24", 24''') which are movable relatively to one another, a distributor arm (26) articulated on the free end of the distribution mast (18) and a conveyor line (32, 32') for the concrete extending along the distribution mast (18) from the rotary column (16) to the distributor arm (26). In order to be able to use the concreting device even on low tunnel work sites, the distribution mast (18) consists of at least two longitudinally telescopic pole arms (24, 24', 24", 24'''), while the distributor arm (26) is fitted on the distribution mast (18) to rotate about a transverse axis (30) perpendicular to the telescopic axis and about a longitudinal axis (28) perpendicular thereto. The conveyor line (32, 32'), which is at least partly a flexible hose, can be automatically wound on a hose drum (38) fitted on the rotary column (16) and wound off it in accordance with the telescopic extension of the distribution mast (18).

A concreting device comprising a rotary column 
(16) rotatable about a vertical axis (14) on a chassis 

(10), a distribution mast (18) arranged pivotally about 
a horizontal axis (20) on the rotary column (16), and 

has at least two elongated mast arms (24, 24', 24", 24"') 
which are movable relative to one another, a distributor 

arm (26; 26', 26") hinged to the free end of the 
distribution mast (18), and a conveyor line (32, 32') for 

the concrete, which conveyor line extends from the 
rotary column (16) to the distributor arm (26; 26', 26") 

along the distribution mast (18), with the distribution 
mast consisting of at least two mast arms (24, 24', 24", 

24"'), the distributor arm (26; 26', 26") being pivotally 
arranged about a transverse axis (30) which is 

perpendicular with respect to the axis of the mast, and 
about a longitudinal axis (28) which is perpendicular 

with respect to the transverse axis, on the distribution 
mast (18), and the conveyor line (32, 32') being fastened 

to the end of the distributor mast (18), which end is on 
the side of the distributor arm and being able to be 

taken along with the distribution mast, wherein the 
distribution mast consists of at least two 

longitudinally telescopic mast arms (24, 24', 24", 24"'), 
and wherein the conveyor line (32, 32'), which is at 

least partly designed as a flexible hose, can be wound 
automatically onto a hose drum (38) arranged on the 

rotary column (16) and can be unwound automatically from 
said drum in accordance with the telescopic extension of 

the distribution mast (18). 
The concreting device according to Claim 1, 
wherein the hose drum (38) has a motor-driven,  

 
preferably hydraulic rotary drive acting in the winding-up 

direction. 
The concreting device according to Claim 1 or 
2, wherein the distributor arm (25', 26") is arranged on 

a work platform (56) or a work cabin rotatable about a 
vertical axis and is hinged with an automatic level 

balancing to the end of the last mast arm (24"'), which 
end is on the side of the distributor arm behind the 

transverse axis (30). 
The concreting device according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 3, wherein the conveyor line (32) has a pipe 

coupling or a mouth piece (40) at its end (32') on the 
side of the distributor arm for connection to a feed 

pipe (42) of a tunnel form (46). 
The concreting device according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 4, wherein the conveyor line (32) has a 

concrete-spraying nozzle (58), which is preferably 
loadable with compressed air, at its end on the side of 

the distributor arm. 
The concreting device according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 5, wherein a concrete pump (36), which can 

be supplied with concrete through a material-feeding 
container (34), is arranged in the chassis (10). 
The concreting device according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 6, wherein the distributor arm (26; 26', 

26") consists of two longitudinally telescopic arm 
sections. 
The concreting device according to one of the 
Claims 1 to 7, wherein the distributor mast (18) can be 

pivoted with its telescopic axis about the horizontal  
 

axis (20) on the rotary column (16) between a position 
pointing approximately 10° to 20° downwardly inclined 

and a position pointing approximately vertically 
upwardly.
