<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor wafer cooling pedestal (14) has a wafer 
cooling surface (15) which includes both an electrostatic 

chuck portion (12) to hold the wafer (16) securely to the 
pedestal (14) during wafer cooling and a thermal transfer 

portion to cool the wafer (16). The entire wafer cooling 
surface (15) of the pedestal (14) is mirror finished to 

provide intimate contact between the pedestal cooling 
surface (15) and the wafer (16), thereby providing 

efficient thermal transfer from the wafer (16) to the 
pedestal (14) without the need for placing a thermal 

transfer medium, such as Argon or other inert gas, between 
the wafer (16) and the pedestal (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of 
integrated circuits. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to the cooling of semiconductor wafers 
during the manufacture of integrated circuits. Intense heat is often used during the various process steps 
that are necessary to fabricate integrated circuits on 
silicon wafers. It is then necessary to cool the wafers 
because the wafer temperature is usually in the range of 
500°C to 800°C after such processing steps, making transport 
difficult (e.g. in a standard plastic wafer carrier), and 
limiting the ability to perform subsequent processing steps 
that may require lower wafer temperatures.  When the temperature of the wafer is in the 500°C to 800°C 
range, the wafer cools rapidly by radiation, i.e. by 
thermal transfer to the ambient. However, when the wafer 
has cooled such that the wafer temperature is in the 300°C 
range, the rate at which the wafer cools by radiation slows 
considerably. The wafer cooling rate slows because the rate 
of cooling by radiation is proportional to the wafer 
temperature raised to the fourth power. That is, the 
amount of decrease in the rate at which the wafer cools by 
radiation becomes greater as the wafer temperature 
decreases. It is necessary to cool a processed wafer from the 300°C 
range to the 100°C range to allow the wafer to be loaded 
into a standard plastic wafer handling cassette for 
additional processing, testing, and/or assembly. Typically, 
such cooling proceeds in a cooling chamber under vacuum. 
Current industry practice involves the following steps to 
accomplish such wafer cooling: 
1. The processed wafer is transferred to a water cooled 
pedestal in a cool down chamber under vacuum to minimize 
exposure of the wafer to the ambient, which would otherwise 
contaminate the wafer.  2. The chamber pressure is increased to several bar (Torr) 
by introducing an inert gas, such as argon, between the 
processed wafer and the water cooled pedestal. The inert 
gas provides a thermal transfer medium that conducts heat 
from the wafer to the water cooled pedestal. In most 
applications, the inert gas is applied to a backside of the 
wafer to minimize the amount of pressure within the chamber. 
In such arrangement, the wafer is retained in position 
relative to the pedestal by a mechanical clamp. 3. Cooling proceeds until the wafer is cooled to about 
100°C. The chamber is then pumped down to avoid increasing 
the base pressure of the wafer processing system and the 
wafer is transferred from
