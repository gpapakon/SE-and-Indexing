<ABSTRACT>
In a branched optical fibre network in which an optical signal (I) 
modulated with a data signal is distributed by a transmitter connected to the 

network, OTDR based on correlation is applied independently of position by 
uncoupling both a signal part (I₁) of the distributed signal (I) in the forward 

direction and a signal part (R₁) of the reflected signal (R) in the return direction 
at an arbitrarily chosen uncoupling point P in a fibre connection (46) of the 

network, detecting them and correlating them with one another. A device for 
performing such a positionally independent correlation OTDR is provided with 

uncoupling means (60) having a first signal output (68) and a second signal 
output (66), via which outputs the signal part (I₁) and the signal part (R₁), 

respectively, are fed to optical receivers (70 and 71). The signal parts received 
are detected by the receivers, demodulated and corresponding electrical signals 

are supplied to a correlator (78) which produces an OTDR signal for an OTDR 
imaging means (82).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of monitoring optical fibre networks.
More particularly, it is in the field of monitoring the physical state of optical
fibre connections by means of fault location techniques with the aid of optical
time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) based on correlation. The invention relates
to an application of such a fault location technique in a branched network of an
optical fibre connection during operation.To monitor the physical state not only of a single optical fibre
connection but also of branched optical fibre networks, it is generally known to
apply OTDR techniques for locating faults such as optical fibre rupture. In this
technique, a short optical pulse is launched at an input end of the optical fibre
connection or the optical fibre network and the reflected optical signal is then
detected at the same input end during a certain period of time. Since near
reflections are back earlier at the input end than those further away, the reflected
power in the optical fibre connection or the optical fibre network can be
measured as a function of the distance from the input end. Not only do strong
reflections occur as a consequence of the presence of connectors or mechanical
splices, but weak reflections are also present as a consequence of Rayleigh
backscattering. Optical fibre rupture and its location can easily be detected since
a signal is no longer reflected from distances beyond a rupture. Reference [1]
discloses a method and a device for using OTDR in which, instead of a short 
optical pulse, series of optical pulses are injected into the optical transmission
medium, such as an optical fibre and in which the reflected signal is then
correlated with the injected signal. From the correlation, a signal is obtained
which represents the amplitude of the reflected signal as a function of the time
which has elapsed since the pulse series were injected or as a function of the
distance traversed from the point at which the pulse series were injected. The
disadvantage of such an OTDR technique is that the launching of an additional
signal is required. Since it is preferably precisely during operation that
monitoring of the connection or of the network takes place, special procedures
are necessary in order not to disturb the signal traffic passing via the connection
or the network. As a solution to this problem, it is known, for example from
reference [2], to use a wavelength of the pulse signal for fault location which is
markedly different from the communication wavelength. A solution in
