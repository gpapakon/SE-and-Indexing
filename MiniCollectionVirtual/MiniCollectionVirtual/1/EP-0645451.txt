<ABSTRACT>
Structural analogues of fibroblast growth factors have 
at least one point mutation in a heparin binding site. Typical 

point mutations are deletions or replacements of basic 
residues with other residues, e.g., neutral or acidic residues. 

In some embodiments, the analogues have at least one 
point mutation in a heparin binding site. Preferred analogues 

have one or two basic residues replaced by glutamine, 
and exhibit a binding affinity to cell surface receptors 

similar or superior to native growth factor, but different 
heparin binding and biol
ogical activity from the native 
growth factor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fibroblast growth factor
structural analogues, notably fibroblast growth factor-2
(formerly called basic fibroblast growth factor) analogues,
which have point mutations in a heparin binding site, e.g.,
one or more basic residues replaced by other residues such
as neutral residues. The analogues exhibit binding affinities
to cell surface receptors similar to the native
growth factor, but possess different heparin binding and
biological properties from the native factor.Polypeptide growth factors are hormone-like modulators
of cell proliferation and differentiation. Growth factors
are responsible for the regulation of a variety of physiological
processes, including development, regeneration, and
wound repair, and have been associated with normal as well
as with pathophysiological processes. Numerous growth factors
have been identified in various tissues and cells, and
names that have been applied to these factors include epidermal
growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve
growth factor, hematopoietic growth factor, and fibroblast
growth factor.Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) was first described as
an activity derived from bovine brain or pituitary tissue 
which was mitogenic for fibroblasts and endothelial cells.
It was later noted that the primary mitogen from brain was
different from that isolated from pituitary. These two factors
were named acidic and basic FGF, respectively. Acidic
and basic FGF are proteins containing approximately 154
amino acids. Their amino acid sequences exhibit an approximate
55% sequence homology between them.Acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors are now
known to be members of a larger family of heparin-binding
growth factors which collectively trigger a variety of biological
responses in many cell types, including those of
mesoderm and neuroectoderm origin, such as endothelial
cells, smooth muscle cells, adrenal cortex cells, prostatic
and retina epithelial cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes,
chrondocytes, myoblasts, and osteoblasts. As original
family members, acidic and basic FGF are now denoted FGF-1
and FGF-2, respectively. Seven other members of the family
have been identified on the basis of their modulation of
cell proliferation and differentiation, and sequence homology
to other FGFs.In addition to eliciting a mitogenic response that
stimulates cell growth, fibroblast growth factors can stimulate
a large number of cell types to respond in a non-mitogenic
manner. These activities include promotion of cell
migration into wound
