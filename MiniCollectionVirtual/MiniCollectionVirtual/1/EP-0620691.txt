<ABSTRACT>
A multiplexed audio-video signal transmission system 
has a camera-equipped intercom (1, 2, 3) which produces a 

balanced audio-video signal. A twisted pair-wire connected 
to the intercom transmits a multiplexed signal of audio 

signal, video signal modulated to a frequency band not 
overlapping the audio signal frequency, and DC power. The 

audio signal and video signal are carried in the pair-wire in 
opposite phase in a balanced condition, and the DC power is 

carried between the pair-wire. A relay device (4) is inserted 
in the pair-wire to refine the video signal. Main line 

branching device (7) and door branching device (13) are 
provided to branch out the multiplexed signal to a television 

equipped control unit 17.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiplexed audio-video transmission
system through a pair-wire, such as used for connecting telephones, and using a
main line branching device and to a branch line branching device enabling multiplex
transmission of video signals and audio signals through the pair-wire, thereby
enabling a point-to-multipoint connection model. This type of system is typically
used in security systems using the pair-wire to provide two-way audio and one-way
video viewing.GB-A-2225195 representing the closest prior art from which the invention
proceeds discloses a two-wire television interphone system having a line voltage
discriminator in a master device which detects a line voltage variation due to a
calling operation at a branch device. A voltage controller in the branch device then
shifts the system from a standby state to an operation state, and drives a call
signal generator in the branch device for actuation of a call signal receiver in the
master device. The system is thus made to have a power supply energized for a
power supply to the system only when required for effecting the calling operation,
talking between the devices, etc..In the book "Basic Television and Video Systems", 5th edition, Bernard
Grob, McGraw-Hill, 1984, intercom systems are described where relatively long
cables are used for transmitting video and audio signals and automatic gain control
circuits are provided.Fig. 10 shows a further prior art audio-video transmission system such as
applied in an audio-video security system. The audio-video security system comprises a camera-equipped audio
terminal 201 and a television-equipped audio terminal 217. The camera-equipped
audio terminal 201, of which the exterior camera-equipped intercom unit, or
interphone unit, is typical, transmits the multiplexed audio signal, DC current and
video signal, which is modulated to a frequency band not overlapping the audio
signal frequency band. The television-equipped audio terminal 217, of which the
interior television-equipped intercom unit is typical, 
comprises an audio transmitter 215 for supplying DC current
and receiving and transmitting the audio signal, and a video
receiver 216 for receiving the video signal. The camera-equipped
audio terminal 201 and television-equipped audio
terminal 217 are connected by means of a specific wire pair
202a, 202b in the main line paired cable comprising plural
wire pairs, a specific wire pair 207a, 207b in the branch line
paired cable comprising plural wire pairs, the dedicated audio
sign
