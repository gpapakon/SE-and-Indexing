<ABSTRACT>
A CO2 slab laser (10) is disclosed having a pair of spaced apart electrodes (12, 14) defining a rectangular discharge region (16). RF energy (20) is fed through the electrodes to excite the CO2 gas. A pair of mirrors (18) are located adjacent the electrodes to define the resonant cavity. A recombinant surface (60) is placed between the ends of the electrodes and the mirrors to quench oxidizing species generated by the discharge before they reach the mirrors. In this manner, the degradation of the mirrors (18) is reduced so that the high power performance of the laser can be maintained. The recombinant surfaces can be defined by forming extension regions (36) at the end of the electrodes between which the discharge is minimized. Alternatively, a mirror shield (60) having a beam transmitting aperture can be used to quench the oxidizing species.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laser comprising: 
a pair of elongate electrodes spaced apart and 
configured to define a discharge region therebetween; a lasing gas located between the electrodes; RF excitation means for energizing the electrodes to 
excite the gas and generate a gas discharge in the lasing gas, 
the lasing gas being such that the discharge includes oxidizing 
species; and a pair of mirrors located adjacent the ends of the 
electrodes and defining a resonator for producing a laser beam. A laser of the kind just defined is described in US 
patent no. 4 719 639 or US patent no. 5 127 017. There has been considerable recent interest in 
developing CO2 slab lasers. These lasers have been shown to 
generate high output powers in an efficient manner. Prior art 
references discussing such slab lasers include "Radio-frequency 
Excited Stripline CO and CO2 lasers," Gabai, Hertzberg and 
Yatsiv, Abstract presented at Conference on Lasers and Electro-optics, 
June 1984; U.S. Patent No. 4 719 639, issued January 
12, 1988 to Tulip; U.S. Patent No. 4 939 738 issued July 3, 
1990 to Opower and U.S. Patent No. 5 048 048 issued September 
10, 1991 to Nishimae. Reference should also be made to European 
Patent No. 486 152 which is a patent family member to US patent application serial no. 07/596 788. Coherent, Inc. has developed a CO2 slab laser which is 
described in the above-mentioned United States patent application serial no. 
07/596 788, filed October 12, 1990. The laser described therein 
includes a pair of spaced electrodes configured to define a 
rectangular discharge region. The lasing gas is excited by 
passing an RF current through the electrodes. A pair of mirrors 
are mounted at the ends of the electrodes to define the 
resonator. The spacing between the electrodes is selected so 
that light is guided between the surface of the electrodes. In 
the wider dimension, the light propagates in free space and is 
confined by the resonator mirrors. To  
 
maximize performance, the resonator 
mirrors are spherical and selected to define a stable 
resonant cavity along the waveguide axis (the axis 
extending between the electrodes) and an unstable 
resonator perpendicular thereto (the free space 
axis). In addition, the spacing between the end of 
the electrodes and the mirrors is selected so that 
the radius of curvature of the wavefront of the laser 
beam in the waveguide axis at the mirror location 
matches the radius of curvature of the mirrors 
selected for the unstable resonator. Since the 
mirror

configured to define a discharge region therebetween; 
a lasing gas located between the electrodes (12,14); 
RF excitation means (20,22) for energizing the

shield members (60; 110) each shield member (60; 110) being located 
between a respective adjacent pair of ends of the electrodes 

(12,14) and a respective associated one of the mirrors (18), 
each shield member (60; 110) being oriented perpendicular to the axis 

of the resonator and having an aperture (62; 112) formed therein and 
aligned with the associated mirror (18) and of sufficient 

dimensions so as not to substantially interact with the said 
laser beam, and in that each shield member (60; 110) is electrically 

connected to ground with respect to the RF excitation means 
(20,22) whereby ionised oxidizing species generated in the 

discharge are quenched by the shield members (60; 110) before reaching the mirrors (18).
