<DESCRIPTION>
 AN ADHESIVE COMPOSITION FOR CIGARETTE SEAMSThis invention relates to an adhesive composition which is especially suited for use in the manufacture of cigarettes and, more particularly, for gluing the longitudinal seam of a cigarette manufactured in a high-speed machine operation.Cigarettes are generally made by wrapping cut, dried tobacco in paper to form a cylindrically shaped product with a seam that runs the entire length of the cigarette. An adhesive is used to secure this longitudinal seam. If the cigarette has a filter, then an adhesive is also used both to form the filter and to secure the filter to the paper.Most cigarettes are manufactured using high-speed machines which produce anywhere from 2,000 to 12,000 cigarettes per minute. These fast machine speeds require adhesive formulations with a high solids content and a low viscosity so that they can be quickly applied to the paper and rapidly dried thereon. Conventionally, synthetic emulsified resins provided the necessary functional requirements. It is essential that cigarette seam adhesives have a high solids content, low viscosity and a good paper penetration rate.The chemical composition of cigarette smoke has come under close scrutiny by both governmental authorities and anti-smoking groups. The combustion products of the synthetic emulsified resins used in cigarette seam adhesives form part of the cigarette smoke. With the pressures currently on the tobacco industry, there is a need to produce a cigarette with a high degree of natural products.U.S. Patent No. 5,155,140 issued October 13, 1992 suggests using a gum arabic base adhesive in combination with other starch-based materials. The 

'140 patent teaches that suitable other starch-based materials include chemically modified starch, white and yellow dextrins and gelatinized starch. Gum arabic (acacia) is a non-converted carbohydrate obtained from the plant Acacia Senegal and related species of the Acacia.European Patent Application/Publication No. 458,233 A2 published November 27, 1991 suggests using a combination of a crosslinked starch with a fluidity or converted starch. Both starches have an amylopectin content of at least 70% by weight. Crosslinked starch is a modified starch in which a non-carbohydrate component has been introduced to provide the crosslinking. It has now been discovered that a cigarette seam adhesive composition can be made solely from natural starch-based products without the need for chemically modified starch or crosslinked starch.
