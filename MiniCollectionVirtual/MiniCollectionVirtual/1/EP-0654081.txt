<ABSTRACT>
Hypoglycosylated recombinant glucosidase oxidases (GOD) with a molecular weight between 68 and 80 kDa approximately, a specific activity of about 200 U/mg unit weight, about 12 % carbohydrate proportion, is obtained by expression of a recombinant DNA which contains the GOD gene in the N-glycosylation defective yeast mutants DSM 7042, DSM 7338, DSM 7160 or DSM 7340 or allelic mutant strains, by fermentation and isolation of the enzyme from the culture supernatant or from the cells.

<CLAIMS>
Hypoglycosylated recombinant glucose oxidase (GOD) 
with a molecular weight of 68 - 80 kDa, a specific 

activity of ca. 200 U/mg unit of weight, a 
carbohydrate portion of ca. 12 % which is 

obtainable by expression of a recombinant DNA 
containing the GOD gene from Aspergillus in the 

N-glycosylation-defective yeast mutants DSM 7042, 
DSM 7338, DSM 7160 or DSM 7340 or allelic mutant 

strains thereof, fermentation and isolation of the 
enzyme from the culture supernatant or the cells. 
Process for the production of a hypoglycosylated 
recombinant glucose oxidase with a molecular weight 

of ca. 68 - 80 kDa, a specific activity of ca. 
200 U/mg unit of weight and a carbohydrate portion 

of ca. 12 % which is obtainable by expression of a 
recombinant DNA which contains the GOD gene in the 

N-glycosylation-defective yeast mutants DSM 7042, 
DSM 7338, DSM 7160 or DSM 7340 or allelic mutant 

strains thereof, fermentation and isolation of the 
enzyme from the culture supernatant or the cells. 
Use of a glucose oxidase as claimed in claim 1 in 
diagnostic tests.
