<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to surface wave filter
elements according to the preamble of claim 1 and a method for manufacturing
a surface wave filter element according to the preamble of method claim 3.Various surface wave filter elements have been used in
circuits of audio apparatuses, video apparatuses,
communication apparatuses or the like. A surface wave
filter element is basically comprised of a piezoelectric
element portion on which elastic surface waves propagate and
comb-like IDT electrodes for inputting and outputting
signals.For frequencies in a relatively low range, dielectric
ceramics are used for the piezoelectric element portion of
the surface wave filter elements. Surface wave filter
elements for mobile communication apparatuses using
relatively high frequency band on the order of 1 GHz uses 
single crystal substrate materials such as LiNbO3, LiTaO3
and quartz as the piezoelectric element portion.Meanwhile in general, when the number of users of a
frequency band increases to the limit, the frequency band
used are moved into a higher band. For example, when
the limit for utilization is reached for a frequency band
from 800 MHz to 900 MHz which is a frequency band
used for portable telephones and cellular telephones, the
used band is changed to a 1.4 GHz band, a 1.9 GHz band, and
a 2.4 GHz band in the order listed. In this case, a
surface wave filter element used in these devices is made
adaptable to the higher frequencies.One factor which determines the center frequency of a
surface wave filter element is the line spacing and line
width of the comb-like IDT electrodes. Therefore in order
to raise the center frequency, it is necessary to make the
line spacing tighter and the line width smaller with higher
accuracy. But it is difficult to make the tight and narrow
line spacing and line width . Then it becomes necessary to
make fast a propagation velocity of elastic surface waves
which is a value specific to the material used .However, the conventionally used ZnO, LiNbO3 or LiTaO3
provides an elastic surface wave propagation velocity on the
order of 3 Km/sec. Therefore for example, it is 
difficult to form the surface wave filter element whose
center frequency is approximately 2 GHz or higher by using
photolithography utilizing a stepper apparatus. For surface
wave filter elements utilizing such piezoelectric materials
adapted to frequencies higher than this, an apparatus utilizing
X-rays or electron rays as a light source for
photolithography is required, which is not easy to
fabricate
