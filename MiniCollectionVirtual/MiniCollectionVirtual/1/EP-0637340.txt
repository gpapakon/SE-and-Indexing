<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ligand/anti-ligand assays
for detection and measurement of adherent proteins, including
lipophilic serum and plasma proteins, cytokines, globular serum
and plasma proteins, and pentraxins. Assays of the present
invention are particularly useful for detection and measurement
of serum amyloid A, apolipoprotein Al, apolipoprotein B, CRP,
IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, albumin and similar adherent proteins.Biological fluids such as plasma and serum contain numerous
proteins. The presence, absence or concentration of a particular
protein may be of interest because, e.g., such data provide
information regarding the clinical state of the individual from
which the biological fluid was obtained. Accordingly, it is
desired to have relatively simple and inexpensive assays to
detect the presence of and determine the concentration of such
proteins.By way of example, plasma and serum contain several classes
of proteins which are non-covalently linked to lipids. These
lipophilic proteins perform a variety of functions, including
lipid transport, intercellular communication, and host defense.
Medical research has found that in a number of disease states,
levels of lipophilic serum and plasma proteins deviate from those
found in non-disease states. The significance of these
deviations is the subject of active clinical research.The concentrations of many of the lipophilic erum or plasma
proteins change as the physical state of the body changes. For
example, the level of serum amyloid A dramatically increases
during inflammation; the level of apoliprotein Al decreases
during coronary disease, while that of apolipoprotein B is
elevated during coronary disease. Clinical measurement of these
kinds of proteins will therefore become more important as more is
learned about the mechanisms of various disease states.Accurate and reproducible measurement of lipophilic serum or
plasma proteins has historically been difficult. Many factors 
contribute to these difficulties, such as the existence of
multiple forms of the lipophilic proteins and the inherent
"stickiness" of the lipophilic proteins.Organisms frequently contain several molecular forms of a
particular lipophilic protein, which differ only slightly in
amino acid sequence. These molecular forms are known as
isotypes, each of which may in turn may exist in multiple
conformational states. Immunological reactivity may vary among
isotypes and conformational states of a particular isotype.Conformational changes are frequently observed in
apolipoproteins

A method of determining the presence or amount of an
adherent protein in a sample, the adherent protein being

capable of forming a non-specific hydrophobic interaction
with a support medium, the method comprising:


(a) contacting the sample at high salt concentration of
from about 0.15 M to saturation, at a pH of 8 or greater,

and at elevated temperature with a support medium having an
affinity for the adherent protein under conditions to

promote binding of the adherent protein to the support
medium;
(b) contacting the support medium obtained in step (a)
with at least one anti-ligand for the adherent protein under

conditions to promote specific binding of the anti-ligand to
the adherent protein;
(c) detecting and measuring the amount of anti-ligand
bound to the adherent protein; and
(d) either (i) relating the amount of anti-ligand
determined in step (c) with the amount of anti-ligand

measured for at least one control sample prepared in
accordance with steps (a) - (c), said control sample

comprising one or more unrelated proteins known to be free
of the adherent protein, or (ii) relating the amount of

anti-ligand measured in step (c) with the amount of anti-ligand
measured for samples containing known amounts of

adherent protein, said samples comprising purified adherent
protein in a solution of one or more unrelated proteins, and

prepared in accordance with steps (a) - (c).
The method of claim 1, wherein the adherent protein is a
lipophilic serum protein, a cytokine or a globular serum or

plasma protein or a pentraxin.
The method of claim 2, wherein the lipophilic serum
protein is one associated with HDL, LDL, or VLDL.
The method of claim 3, wherein the lipophilic serum
protein is one associated with HDL.
The method of claim 2, wherein the lipophilic serum
protein is serum amyloid A, apoprotein Al, apoprotein B,

tumor necrosis factor, or interleukin-6.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said
temperature in step (a) is from about 40°C to about 65°C.
The method of claim 6, wherein the pH of step (a) is from
about pH 8 to about pH 11.
The method of claim 1, wherein the unrelated protein is a
globular serum protein.
The method of claim 1, wherein the unrelated proteins are
immunoglobulin G and serum albumin.
The method of claim 1, wherein the unrelated protein is
serum albumin.
The method of claim 1, wherein the support medium
comprises a solid medium.
The method of claim 1, wherein the solid medium
comprises microtiter plates, plastic beads, resins, or

magnetic beads.
The method of claim 1, wherein the support medium
comprises a liquid medium. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the anti-ligand is a
polyclonal antiserum, a monoclonal immunoglobulin, a

receptor molecule, or a lipid transport molecule.
The method of claim 1, wherein the detection system
comprises a conjugated anti-ligand-specific antibody, a

conjugated anti-ligand-specific antibody fragment, or
conjugated biotin-avidin.
The method of claim 15, wherein the conjugate is a
fluorescent marker.
The method of claim 16, wherein the conjugate is
fluorescein or rhodamine.
The method of claim 15, wherein the conjugate is an
enzyme.
The method of claim 18, wherein the conjugate is
β-galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase, or horseradish

peroxidase.
