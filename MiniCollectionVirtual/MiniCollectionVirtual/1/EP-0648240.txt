<ABSTRACT>
A process for the modification of a polyphenylene ether resin composition is claimed, said process being carried out in a temperature range of between the melting point and the degradation point of said resin composition and in the presence of an effective amount of a citraconimide compound to reduce the melt viscosity of said resin composition, said citraconimide compound being represented by formula (I), wherein X is selected from the group consistin of hydrogen, C1-C18 alkyl groups, C2-C18 alkenyl groups, C2-C18 alkynyl groups, C3-C18 cycloalkyl groups, C3-C18 cycloalkenyl groups, C3-C18 cycloalkynyl groups, C6-C18 aryl groups, C7-C30 aralkyl groups, C7-C30 alkaryl groups, and C7-C30 alkenaryl groups, all of which may be linear or branched and unsubstituted or substituted with one or more amino, carboxy, cyano, halogens, esters, oxiranes, ethers, nitro, hydroxy and alkoxy groups. The melt viscosity of the resin compositions is significantly reduced by the process of the present invention. Furthermore, functional groups are introduced in the resin compositions by modification with a functional group-containing citraconimide compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
PROCESS FOR THE MODIFICATION OF POLYPHENYLENE ETHER RESIN COMPOSITIONSThe present invention relates to a process for the modification of polyphenylene ether resin compositions in the presence of a citraconimide compound, to the use of said citraconimide compound in the modification of said resin composition, to the resin composition modified in accordance with the present process and to articles comprising the modified resin composition. The primary advantage of the process of the present invention is the improvement of the meIt-flow properties of the resin compositions.Polyphenylene ether resins are high performance engineering thermoplastics having relatively high melt viscosities and melting points. They are useful for many commercial applications requiring high temperature resistance and can be formed into films, fibers and molded articles. However, the art has recognized that polyphenylene ether resins have a major drawback. Because of the high melt viscosity and melting point of the resins, they require a high molding temperature and molding pressure. This leads to difficulties in the melt processing. There have been, therefore, attempts to improve the melt-flow properties of these resins, either alone or in compositions.For example, European patent application EP 0257486 discloses the use of maleimides in a process to improve the flow properties of polyphenylene ether resins. European patent application EP 0 121 974 discloses the use of maleimides to suppress the increase of the molecular weight of polyphenylene ether resins under extrusion conditions. The examples in the specification show a decrease in the melt-viscosity of the polyphenylene ether resin, when modified. Also Chiba et al., Int. Pol. Sci . Techn., vol. 16, No. 3, 1989, pp. 25-30, discloses that maleimide influences the melt-flow properties of the PPO. However, according to this publication, maleimide does not undergo a graft reaction with PPO during the melt-mixing process. 

According to the present invention there is provided a process for the modification of a polyphenylene ether resin composition, characterized by the step of reacting the polyphenylene ether resin composition at a temperature above the melting point and below the degradation point of said resin composition with an effective amount of a citraconimide compound to reduce significantly the melt viscosity of said resin composition, said citraconimide compound being represented by the formula (I):
 wherein X is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C^-Cis
