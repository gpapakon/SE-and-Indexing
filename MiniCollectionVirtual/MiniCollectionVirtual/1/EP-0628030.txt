<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines
having anti-psychotic activity, and also to the synthesis of α-substituted-arylacetamides,
especially fused-ring nitrogen heterocycles, in particular
dihydroindoles, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines and 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-3-benzazocines,
and most particularly 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines.Dihydroindoles, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines, 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-3-benzazocines,
and particularly 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines
are known to have useful pharmacological properties. For
example, U. S. Patents 3,393,192, 3,609,138, 4,011,319, 4,284,555 and
4,477,378, and British Patent Specification no. 1,118,688, all describe
1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines having various activities
described as antibacterial effects, central nervous system effects and
hypotensive effects.Weinstock et al. in Drugs of the Future, Vol. 10, No. 8, pp. 645-697
(1985) discuss the profound effect that 1-phenyl substituents have on the
dopaminergic activity of certain types of benzazepines; see in particular
Table II on page 666. European Patent Application No. 83105610.6 (published as
0 096 838) discloses certain 1-aryloxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines
optionally having alkoxy substituents in the 7- and/or
8-position; these compounds are disclosed as having utility in treating
depression.U. S. Patent 5,015,639 describes and claims 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepines
lacking a 1-phenyl group but having instead a variety of
1-substituents including a group of the formula

wherein m is 0 or 1, and each of the groups R9, which can be the same or
different, is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, aralkyl or aryl
group. These compounds have good anti-dopaminergic activity, and in
particular show surprising selectivity for the D-1 subclassification of
dopaminergic receptors. lorio et al., Pharmacol. Exp, Ther. (1983), 226,
page 462, and lorio et al. in Neurobiology of Central D1-Dopamine
Receptors, pages 1-14 in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology
204, Eds. Creese and Breese, Plenum, New York, 1986, have also
evaluated the effects of benzazepines on dopamine receptors. Charifson
et al., J. Med. Chem. (1988), 31, pages 1941-1946, have similarly
evaluated 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines.International Application No. PCT/US 91/04046 describes and
claims (interalia) compounds having the structural formula A
