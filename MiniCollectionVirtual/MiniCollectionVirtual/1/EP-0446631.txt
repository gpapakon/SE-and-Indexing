<ABSTRACT>
A system for locating and identifying the amount field 
(64) on a check (40) or other financial document 

including the steps of identifying the type of 
characters within each rectangular block as either 

machine print, hand print, decimal point, or vertical 
bar, and then using that identification of type to 

determine which block is to be identified as the amount 
field (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the following IBM 
patents: 
1. "Document Processor Including A Method and 
Apparatus For Identifying and Correcting Errors" 
(US Patent Application Serial No. 07/491 896) 
filed by Dinan et al. concurrently on 12 March 
1990, the specification and drawings of which are 
hereby specifically incorporated herein by 
reference. 2. "Image Balancing System and Method" (US Patent 
Application Serial No. 07/492 461) filed by Lyke 
et al. concurrently on 12 March 1990, the 
specification and drawings of which are hereby 
specifically incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to a method and system 
for processing documents. More specifically, the 
present invention is specifically related to the 
process for locating a particular field on a document, 
such as the amount field which appears in a location 
which varies from one type of check to the next, but 
which is identifiable by predetermined algorithms.  Various document processors (also referred to as 
"reader/sorters" or "check readers" by some) have been 
marketed by various manufacturers. Some of these 
document processors include apparatus and methods for 
lifting either the entire image of the document as it 
passes or a selected portion of the document. For 
example, IBM marketed a machine known as the IBM Model 
3895 in the 1970's which processed documents including 
apparatus and methods to locate and store an image 
window including the field known as the courtesy amount 
or the amount field. Other systems have been proposed which use an image of 
the document or portions of it in an attempt to either 
recognize the amount or present it on a screen so that 
an operator can key enter into memory the amount on 
the document. Examples of such systems include U.S. 
Patent 4,264,808 to Owens et al.; U.S. Patent 4,205,780 
to Burns et al.; and U.S. Patent 4,813,077 to Woods et 
al. In each of these systems, it is important that the 
amount field be located accurately. In some systems 
such as described in the Woods et al. patent, the 
amount field must be located in a predetermined 
location and within predetermined boxes in order that 
the system can accurately locate both th e amount 
fields and the individual characters within the amount 
field. Other systems have been proposed which also 
constrain or require that the amount field be placed in 
a particular orientation. However, a bank which is 
processing all the checks that its customers choose to 
deposit cannot require that all checks be

<CLAIMS>
A method for locating an amount field on a 
document (40) comprising the steps of :

 
creating a black and white image of the entire 

document (40) and counting the n umber of black 
pels in each horizontal line of that document;

 
locating horizontal segments on the document which 

include more black pels in each line that contain 
more than a preset threshold number of black pels;

 
counting the black pels in vertical sections of 

each located horizontal segment of the document 
including more than a threshold number of black 

pels, whereby rectangular areas (72, 74) 
including a substantial number of black pels are 

identified;
 

creating a signature for each such rectangular 
area (72, 74) wherein each character is determined 

to be one type of character selected from the list 
of hand print character, machine print character, 

vertical bar and decimal point; and
 

using the signature of each block to identify a 
block which is likely to be an amount field. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the signature for an 
amount field (64) is identified by finding in 

consecutive order a decimal point, a machine 
readable character, a second machine readable 

character, and a vertical bar. 
A method of identifying an amount field (64) on a 
document (40) including the steps of Claim 1, 

wherein the signature which is recognized includes 
a decimal point, two hand print characters, and a 

vertical bar. 
A method of identifying an amount field (64) on a 
document (40) including the steps of Claim 1 

wherein the step of creating a signature includes 
the step of discarding horizontal lines defining a 

box but including and classifying a vertical line 
as a separate symbol within the signature. 
A method of identifying an amount field (64) on a 
document (40) including the steps of Claim 1 

further including the step of discarding 
horizontal lines which form part of a box. 
A method of identifying an amount field (64) on a 
document including the steps of Claim 1 and 

further including the step of reducing the scan 
area for black pels based upon stored document 

format information.
