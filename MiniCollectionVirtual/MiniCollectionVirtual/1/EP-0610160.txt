<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device 
for controlling radio receivers with warning horn 

for motor vehicle steering wheels (1), which comprises 
a single rigid printed board (2) thereon there are provided 

contacts (3,7) for operating the warning horn and 
microswitch contacts (20) for actuating several functions 

of a radio-receiver apparatus. A connector is more-over 
provided for connecting the electric cable to 

be coupled to the mentioned printed board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device 
for controlling radio receivers with warning horn 
for application to motor vehicle steering wheels. As is known, there have been already made 
motor vehicle steering wheels thereon there are applied 
microswitches in order to drive a radio-receiver 
and, more specifically, to control its tuning, 
frequency, volume and mute functions. In prior art motor vehicle steering wheels 
of the above mentioned type, the controls are actually 
fully separated from the other controls which 
are conventionally provided on a steering wheel, such 
as, for example, the acoustic warning horn control, 
which is made by a circuit which is separated from 
that which operates the radio-receiver. This causes several drawbacks, since a plurality 
of electrical connections must be made during 
the installation operations. Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, 
by providing an integrated device for controlling 
radio-receivers with warning horns, for motor vehicle  
 
steering wheels, which affords a possibility of 
standardizing all of the circuits related to the 
control of the acoustic warning horn and of the functions 
of a radio-receiver thereby greatly reducing 
the wiring complexity during the motor vehicle constructional 
work. Within the scope of the above mentioned aim, 
a main object of the present invention is to provide 
a device, for application to motor vehicle 
steering wheels, which has the controls thereof arranged 
at easily accessible positions, thereby allowing 
an user to operate all of the desird functions 
without detaching his/her hands from the steering 
wheel. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a device which, owing to its constructional 
features, is very reliable and safe in 
operation. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a control device for radio-receivers, 
specifically designed for application to 
motor vehicle steering wheels, which can be easily 
assembled and which, moreover, is very competitive 
from a mere economic standpoint.  According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as well 
as yet other objects, which will become more apparent 
hereinafter, are achieved by a device with integrated 
controls for radio receivers with warning 
horn, specifically designed for application to a 
motor vehicle steering wheel, with integrated controls, 
characterized in that said device comprises 
a single rigid
