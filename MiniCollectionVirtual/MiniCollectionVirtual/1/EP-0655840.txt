<ABSTRACT>
A delay-locked-loop based clock synthesizer for generating, from a reference 
signal, a clock signal having a frequency different from a frequency of the reference 

signal includes a delay-locked-loop circuit having a plurality of controllable delay 
elements serially connected to one another. Each of the delay elements delays the 

reference signal by an adjustable quantum of time such that the delay elements 
generate a plurality of delayed signals. A first multiplexer routes one of the delayed 

signals to a phase detector, which generates a control signal indicative of a difference 
between a phase of the routed delayed signal and a phase of the reference signal. A 

feedback loop transfers the control signal from the phase detector to the delay 
elements, wherein each of the delay elements adjusts, in accordance with the control 

signal, the quantum of time by which they each delay the reference signal, such that 
the phase of the reference signal is synchronized with the phase of the routed delayed 

signal. The clock synthesizer also includes one or more mixing circuits for logically 
combining the delayed signals such that the mixing circuits generate logically 

combined signals. A second multiplexer routes one of the received logically combined 
signals to an output of the second multiplexer, wherein the routed logically combined 

signal represents the clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to clock synthesizers for generating 
clock signals, and more particularly, to clock synthesizers which are implemented 
using delay locked loops having a dynamically adjustable number of delay elements 
located therein. A clock synthesizer generates a clock signal having a particular frequency from 
a reference clock, such as a crystal oscillator. As will be appreciated, it is often 
desirable to have the ability to generate, from a single reference clock, clock signals 
having frequencies which are different from the frequency of the reference clock. In 
other words, it is often desirable to have the ability to synthesize multiple clock 
frequencies from a single reference clock frequency. Figure 1 is a block diagram of a conventional circuit 102 which performs this 
function. The circuit 102 of Figure 1 includes a phase locked loop 114 having a phase 
detector 106, a loop filter 108, and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 110. Phase locked loops are well known and, thus, the structure and operation of the 
phase locked loop 114 contained in the circuit 102 of Figure 1 will be apparent to 
persons skilled in the relevant art. It is noted that phase locked loops are discussed 
in many publicly available documents, such as Phase Locked Loops by R.E. Best 
(McGraw Hill, New York, 1984). The circuit 102 of Figure 1 also includes a "divide by N" divider 104 (hereafter 
called the "N divider") and a "divide by M" divider 112 (hereafter called the "M 
divider"). The N divider 104 operates to generate an output signal from an input 
signal, wherein the frequency of the output signal is equal to the frequency of the input  
 
signal divided by N. Similarly, the M divider 112 operates to generate an output 
signal from an input signal, wherein the frequency of the output signal is equal to the 
frequency of the input signal divided by M. The dividers 104 and 112 can be implemented using a trigger (or T) flip flop 
(see Figure 2), whose output signal SOUT changes state with each rising edge of its 
input signal SIN (see Figure 3). As is apparent from the waveforms in Figure 3, a 
divide by two divider (that is, where N and/or M equals 2) can be implemented using 
a single T flip flop. The manner in which T flip flops can be combined and used to 
implement dividers for other values of N and M will be apparent to persons skilled in 
the relevant art. Referring again to Figure 1, the N divider 104 and the M divider 112 operate 
to modify an input signal FIN (which is
