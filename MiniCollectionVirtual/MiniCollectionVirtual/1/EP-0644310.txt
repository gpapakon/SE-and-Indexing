Set of extruded sections from light alloy, particularly 
from aluminium alloy, 

provided with hooking structures (12) for gaskets (16) 
constituted by a continuous "U"-channel-shaped seat, 

obtained on the sides and/or the flanges of said sections 
and provided with shaped flanges along the edges, 

suitable to pressure-house the peduncle of a continuous 
gasket having the part outside the seat variously 

shaped and constituting also a means for stably anchoring 
sections with other sections and the like in 

combination and/or in opposition with protrusions also 
obtained on the sides and/or flanges of the sections.

<DESCRIPTION>
Object of this invention is to provide a set of extruded
sections from light alloy, particularly from aluminium
alloy, for the realization of door- and window
frames, casings and the like, provided with a particular
structure for the pressure-hooking of seal and back
stop gaskets and for the connection of accessories, or
coupleable with sections provided with said particular
structure.As is known, light alloy frames with openable shutters,
French windows either with shutters or sliding on
rails, etc., are realized by connecting various types
of extruded sections to one another. Said sections
being suitably designed and realized and being provided
with seats for anchoring the accessories, the seal
gaskets between casings and glass pane-holding frame
and between frame and glass-pane, the back stop gaskets
for the shutters and for the locking of glass-panes
through glass stop sections, etc. According to the
known techniques, such seats are obtained during the
extrusion of the section in various positions, either
on the walls of the hollow body of the section or on
the flanges protruding from the walls of said hollow
body, and are constituted by grooves or throats having
a constant, substantially "C"-shaped section, obtained
in a protruding position from the walls or flanges of
the section and developed along the full height of said 
section. Therefore, the various continuous gaskets are
slipped into the "C"-shaped seats starting from an end
of the section and the restraint is ensured by the part
enclosed in the seat, while the part that protrudes
outwards said seat constitutes the real gasket, which
may have different shapes and sizes according to the
function required.EP-A-0460514 (VALCASA) discloses sections comprising
"C" shaped seatings for the application of a packing to
support a pane or to provide a seal against another
section.FR-A-2626931 (O.C.M.A.) discloses sections provided,
onto one of their sides, respectively in proximity of
the ends, of a couple of parallel wings orthogonal in
respect of said sides and a "L" bent protrusion turned
opposite in respect of these two wings. The two wings
end, on their internal surface, with angular grooves
opposite to each other and, on their external surface
with protrusions having a form sensibly quadrangular.
Between the couple of wings, a seal is inserted by
means of restraint.FR-A-2504183 (INDINVEST SPA) discloses sections provided
with couples of parallel wings ending, on their
internal surface, with grooves opposite to each other
and, on their external

<CLAIMS>
Set of extruded sections from light alloy, particularly
aluminium alloy, for the realization of door- and

window frames, casings and the like, comprising sections
provided with hooking structures for gaskets or

coupleable with sections provided with such hooking
structures, characterized in that said hooking structures

are constituted by a continuous channel-shaped seat
(12) having a constant substantially "U"-shaped

through-section, provided with hook-like outwardly
protruding in cross-section triangular flanges (19) running externally

along the longitudinal edge of the flanges of said seat
(12), the channel-shaped hollow space (12) of said seat

being suitable to pressure-house the peduncle or stem
(16a) of a continuous gasket (16) having the part

outside the seat variously shaped, said flanges (19)
protruding towards the outside of said seat constituting

as many means for the stable hooking of sections
with other sections and/or accessories of door and

window casings and the like, in combination and/or in
opposition with protrusions, protuberances or the like,

also obtained on the sides and/or the flanges of said
sections.
Set of extruded sections according to claim 1,
characterized in that said sections are constituted by:


a reversible basic section (1), utilizable both as a 
frame for glazed mobile shutters and as a fixed casing

to be anchored to the wall by means of a sash frame,
a basic section (2) utilizable both as a mobile
shutter and as a fixed frame as well as a hanging stile

and/or a rail of sash,
a basic section (3) utilizable as a frame both for
mobile and fixed shutters,
a section (4) utilizable for fixed frames, rail of
sashes for sills of frame, and for frames of mobile

shutters with slip-in glass pane,
a section (5) for mobile shutters with an external
back stop flange protruding in such a way as to remain

fully aligned with the corresponding flange of the
fixed frame of the door-or window,
a glass stop (6, 7) with a rounded external corner,
a section (8) utilizable as a horizontal or vertical
strip for mobile and fixed shutters,
a section (9) utilizable as a horizontal or vertical

strip for mobile and fixed shutters,
a section (10) having the function of a base bord for
mobile and fixed shutters,
a section (11) having the function of a base board
for mobile and fixed shutters.
Set of extruded sections,
according to claim 1, characterized

in that the set comprises a glass stop (6, 7) provided with a foot (17) and a 
protrusion (18) suitable to elastically engage in the

channel-shaped hollow space provided on the corresponding
basic coupling section, through the hooking of the

end of said foot (17) on the one side with the hook-like
outwardly protruding triangular flange (19) running

along the edge of said "U"-shaped seat (12), and
on the other side with a special protrusion (20) obtained

on the opposing side of said channel-shaped hollow
space, said foot (17) being so shaped at to cause,

during the insertion, the shifting of the plane constituting
the sole (17a) of said foot (17) on an inclined

upper surface (19a) of said flange (19) of said "U"-shaped
seat up to the snapping which realizes the

hooking or coupling, so that the insertion of said
glass stop on said coupling section is obtained by

simple rotation and without the utilization of special
accessories or equipments.
