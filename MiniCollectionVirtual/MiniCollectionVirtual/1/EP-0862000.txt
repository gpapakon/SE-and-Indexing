<ABSTRACT>
A gas tap consists of a body (10) with an inner shut-off element (22) which is held against a seat (24) by an operating knob (28) and the pressure of the gas beneath it. The rod (20) connecting the control knob to the shut--off element is designed so that the tap is opened by a rotary movement followed by an axial movement. The rod is slightly bowed in shape, so that the effort applied to it is in a direction which forms an angle with the axis of the seat.

<CLAIMS>
Gas tap comprising a body (10) with an internal opening and
closure member (22) interacting with a sealing seat (24), an external

operating element (28) and a connecting stem (20) for transmitting the
movement of the operating element (28) to the opening and closure

member (22), whereby the opening and closure member (22) is arranged
in such a way as to be held against the sealing seat (24) under the effect

of the operating element (28) and the pressure of the gas, 
characterized in
that
 the connecting stem (20) is slightly bent so that the direction of the
thrusting force at the opening makes an angle with the axis (A) of the

sealing seat (24).
