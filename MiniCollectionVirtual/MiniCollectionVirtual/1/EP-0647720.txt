<ABSTRACT>
A method for colouring a metal surface (12), in particular of 
stainless steel, comprises subjecting the surface (12) to the 

action of a laser beam (L) of determined frequency and power for a 
predetermined time, this action resulting in the presence of a 

suitable laser energy or power density on that region of the metal 
surface (12) exposed to the laser beam (L) such as to create a 

consequent coloration of said region. The method is implemented 
by a device comprising a laser beam generator (1), means (3) for 

focusing the emitted laser beam (L) onto a metal surface (12), and 
means (17; 23, 24) for varying the energy density released by said 

laser beam at said surface so as to achieve different colorations 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for colouring a metal surface, 
in particular of stainless steel. The invention also relates to a 
device for implementing the method. As is well known, metal surfaces are still coloured by the use of 
suitable paints or galvanic techniques. Although these methods enable any desired coloration to be 
obtained for said surfaces, they have various drawbacks. For 
example, the use of paints involves a lengthy time in achieving 
the desired coloration. In addition this method results in 
considerable environmental pollution connected with the disposal 
of chemical waste generated during painting, and of effluents. The use of galvanic techniques mainly does not allow selective 
coloration to be easily and economically achieved for small-area 
regions. If necessary, coatings have to be used for those parts 
which are not to be treated, this involving the same problems as 
stated in the case of painting. An object of the present invention is to provide a method allowing 
considerable flexibility in achieving metal surface coloration 
which has no negative impact on the environment, which does not 
involve lengthy time for its implementation, and which can be 
implemented in a completely automatic manner, resulting in 
extremely low implementation cost.  A further object is to provide a device for implementing the 
aforesaid method which enables selective coloration even of small-area 
surfaces to be achieved, and is of low constructional and 
operating costs. A further object is to provide a device of the aforesaid type 
which is of reliable use, which can be operated automatically and 
which enables any negative environmental impact to be prevented. These and further objects which will be apparent to the expert of 
the art are attained by a method in accordance with the relative 
accompanying claims. Said objects are attained by a device of the said type in 
accordance with the relative accompanying claims. The present invention will be more apparent from the accompanying 
drawing, which is provided by way of non-limiting example and in 
which: 
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a device according to 
the invention;  Figure 2 is a schematic representation of part of the device 
according to the invention.  With reference to said figures, the device according to the 
invention comprises a laser beam generator 1, preferably a solid 
state giant pulse (or Q-switched) laser, powered by a usual 
electrical power unit 2 and feeding a laser beam L towards a known 
deviator

A method for colouring a metal surface, in particular of 
stainless steel, comprising subjecting the surface to the action 

of a laser beam (L) of determined frequency and power for a 
predetermined time, to define a focal spot (13) on said surface, 

which is positioned at a predetermined distance from a laser beam 
generator (1), this action resulting in the presence of a suitable 

laser energy or power density at the focal spot (13) on that 
region of the metal surface (12) exposed to the laser beam (L) 

such as to create a consequent coloration of said region.

between successive scans by the laser beam (L) on the surface the 

distance of the surface to be coloured from the source (3) of the 
laser beam (L) is changed, this change modifying the power density 

at the focal spot (13).
