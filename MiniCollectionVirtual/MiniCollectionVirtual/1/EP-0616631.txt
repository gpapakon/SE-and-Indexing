<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to active matrix liquid crystal displays and liquid crystal structures for the same. Liquid crystal displays ("LCD's"), in which the electro-optically active element comprises liquid crystalline 
material, are well known in the art. Where an LCD is used to depict simple figures or alphanumeric characters, for example numbers via the 
familiar seven-segment, figure-eight pattern found in calculators and watches, it is feasible to directly 
address each pixel in the display - that is, to provide each pixel with its own set of electrode leads. But 
where the display must depict complex images such as graphics or video images, a large number of pixels 
is required, and it becomes impractical to directly address each one. A display having pixels arranged in M 
rows and N columns has MxN pixels, thus requiring MxN sets of individual leads for direct addressing. As 
the pixel density and/or the size of the display increases, this number rapidly becomes unmanageable. Multiplexing provides a method of addressing each pixel, but with a much lesser number of electrode leads. 
In its most elementary form, multiplexing uses a set of M row electrodes in combination with a set of N 
column electrodes. By applying the proper electrical signals to, for example, the 5th row and 8th column 
electrodes, the pixel at the 5th row and 8th column can be switched on and off. In this way, the number of 
electrode leads can be reduced from MxN to M+N. However, in this form of multiplexing, adjacent pixels 
are not independent of each other. When a voltage sufficient to switch the 5th row-8th column pixel is 
applied, adjacent pixels (e.g., the 4th row-8th column pixel) also experience a substantial voltage and can 
be inadvertently switched, at least in part, leading to cross-talk between adjacent pixels. One type of multiplexed LCD is an active matrix LCD, in which each pixel is driven (switched from one 
visual state to another) by an active switching element such as a thin film transistor ("TFT"), varistor, diode 
or MIM. The switching element helps eliminate cross-talk and maintain an initially applied voltage across 
the corresponding pixel, even  
 
when it is not being actively addressed, so that the pixel stays "on" while other pixels are 
addressed. The longer the pixels holds the initially applied voltage, the longer it can be 
maintained in the "on" state until it is next addressed, permitting the construction of 
displays having a larger number of pixels. If the matrix contains a sufficiently
