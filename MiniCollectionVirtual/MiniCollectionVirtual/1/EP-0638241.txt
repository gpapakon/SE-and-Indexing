<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to fibre-reinforced and non-fibre-reinforced food casings based on cellulose hydrate which contain fats, fat-like compounds or oils, and their use as sausage casings. The fibre-reinforced casings in addition further contain alginic acid or alginate and if desired a copolymer containing units of the formula I, II and/or III, while the non-fibre-reinforced casings, in addition to the said copolymer, can, if desired, contain an addition of alginic acid or alginate.

<CLAIMS>
A fiber-reinforced cellulose-based food casing, wherein its cellulose
matrix contains 3 to 25% by weight of alginic acid or alginate and 1 to

20% by weight of fatty amines, fatty alcohols or ethoxylates of fatty
alcohols, or salts of fatty acids, based on the weight of cellulose in

each case.
The fiber-reinforced food casing as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
content of fatty amines, fatty alcohols or ethoxylates of fatty alcohols,

or salts of fatty acids is 2 to 12 % by weight, based on the weight of
the cellulose.
The fiber-reinforced cellulose-based food casing wherein its cellulose
matrix contains 3 to 25% by weight of alginic acid or alginate and 1 to

20% by weight of fatty amines, fatty alcohols or ethoxylates of fatty
alcohols, or salts of fatty acids, fats or oils, and additionally 0.5 to 15%

by weight, preferably 1 to 5% by weight, based on the weight of the
cellulose in each case, of a copolymer containing 80 to 20 mol% of

units of the formula I and 20 to 80 mol% of units of the formula II or III
