<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel modified oligonucleotides, the construction thereof, and their use in oligonucleotide-based therapies. More specifically, the invention is to novel oligomers having 2', 5' linkages between adjacent nucleomonomers which are resistant to nucleases, having enhanced ability to penetrate cells, and which are capable of binding target oligonucleotide sequences in vitro and in vivo. The oligomers of the invention are particularly useful in oligomer-based therapies utilizing the invention oligomers to modulate protein synthesis or transcription or to otherwise inactivate messenger RNA or double stranded DNA.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel oligomers, the
construction thereof, and their use in oligomer-based
therapies. More specifically, the invention is to novel
oligomers having substitute oligonucleotide linkages
which are resistant to nucleases, having enhanced ability
to penetrate cells, and which are capable of binding
target oligonucleotide sequences invitro and in vivo.
The modified oligomers of the invention are particularly
useful in oligomer-based therapies utilizing the modified
oligomers to interrupt protein synthesis or otherwise
inactivate messenger RNA or double stranded DNA.The application of oligonucleotide analogs for
therapeutic uses represents a relatively new development
in drug design and discovery. Several fundamental
therapeutic approaches that utilize oligomers have been
proposed.One approach is based largely on interfering
with gene expression through oligomer binding to a
complementary RNA sequence. This application is known as
"antisense" therapy because the oligomer base sequence is
identical to the antisense strand of the gene that gave
rise to the RNA (Uhlmann, E., et al., Chem Reviews (1990)
90:543-584; and Stein, C.A., et al., Cancer Res (1988) 
48:2659-2668). Another approach, referred to herein as
"triple helix" therapy utilizes oligomers that bind to
duplex DNA as detailed below. Binding to a target DNA is
sequence specific but involves different base pairing
binding (i.e. Hoogsteen binding). Both antisense and
triple helix therapies exert therapeutic effects via
binding to nucleic acid sequences that are responsible
for disease conditions. Such sequences are found in the
genome of pathogenic organisms including bacteria,
protozoa, yeasts, parasites, fungi or viruses or may be
endogenous sequences (oncogenes). By modulating the
expression of a gene important for establishment,
maintenance or elimination of a disease condition, the
corresponding condition may be cured, prevented or
ameliorated.Another therapeutic approach that is based on
the use of oligomers includes generation of "aptamers"
and is disclosed in commonly owned international patent
application nos. WO 92/14842 and WO 92/14843. This
approach utilizes oligomers that specifically bind to
proteins thereby interfering with their function. The
use of oligomers that mimic the structure of certain RNA
molecules that are bound by intracellular proteins has
also been adduced as a therapeutic approach as described
in international application no. PCT/US91/01822.Antisense oligonucleotides are synthetic
oligonucleotides
