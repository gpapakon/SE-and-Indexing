<ABSTRACT>
A treatment agent for fiber products, represented by general formula (I), comprising a combination of a modifier comprising 
a fluorinated phosphate derivative having a molecular weight of 2,000 or less or a salt thereof with a fixing agent comprising a 

metal salt compound, wherein R¹ and R² may be the same or different from each other and each represents hydrogen or R
f
-(CH₂)
m
-, 
provided that not both of R¹ and R² are hydrogen at the same time; A represents oxygen, sulfur or a direct bond; 

and n is 1 or 2. A method of treating fiber products with the treatment agent and, if necessary, a fluorinated water and oil 
repellent or a fluorinated antisoiling finish. Fiber products can retain inherent touch, hand, hue and flexibility even after the 

treating and use thereof, including washing and friction, and can be endowed with hot water repellency and persistent water 
and oil repellency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an agent for treating a
textile, a method for treating a textile and a treated textile.Hitherto, Japanese Patent Kokoku Publication Nos. 4503/1968
and 4770/1973 as well as Japanese Patent Kokai Publications JP-A-60-64990
and JP-53-50079 disclose that a fluorine-containing phosphate ester and
a fluorine-containing phosphonic acid can give oil-repellency to a
textile and a paper. However, when the fluorine-containing phosphate
ester or the fluorine-containing phosphonic acid alone is used for
treatment, then the touch, the feeling, the color shade and the softness
of treated material are deteriorated because of the treatment, the
initial water- and oil-repellency is insufficient and above properties
are remarkably deteriorated by a wash and/or rub.Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. 215900/1990
discloses a method for treating a leather with a fluorine-containing
phosphoric acid compound and a cationic compound. However, this
document does not disclose the treatment of the textile which is
required to have the good touch, feeling, color shade and softness. USP
2,662,835 discloses a method for treating a fiber material with a
chromium complex salt of a fluorine-containing carboxylic acid.
However, this document does not disclose the water- and oil-repellency
and the method of this document gives no sufficient effect even if used
in a high concentration, and gives remarkably discolored fibers.USP 3,096,207 discloses a method for treating a leather and a 
fiber with a fluorine-containing phosphoric acid compound or a metal
salt thereof. However, since this document discloses the treating agent
and treating method which are different from those of the present
invention, this document gives the worse effect and durability than the
present invention.
Furthermore, in the JP Utility Model Laid open No, 198298/1986 a flame-retardant
stain proofing carpet is described which comprises, inter alia, a
phosphorous or halogen-containing flame-retardant compound.By the way, a fluorine-containing polymeric compound which
is generally used, for example, an acrylic polymeric compound
containing a fluoroalkyl group is used for the treatment, the treated
textile suffers from the disadvantages that the originally possessed
touch, feeling, softness and the like are remarkably deteriorated
because of the treatment and that the above properties and water- and
oil-repellency are remarkably deteriorated when the textile is washed
or rubbed. The initial performances are very poor for a
