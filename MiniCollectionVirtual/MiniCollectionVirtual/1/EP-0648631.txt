<ABSTRACT>
The interior of a motor vehicle roof (46) is lined 
with roof trim (48). A frame (16) for an opening roof 

panel (12) is mounted in an opening in the vehicle roof 
(46) with a portion (20) extending round the vehicle 

opening below the vehicle roof (46). A clamping ring (28) 
is secured to said portion (20) of the frame (16) and has 

a vertical limb (30) abutting against the underside of the 
vehicle roof (46) adjacent to the roof opening. A trim 

flap (44) is formed integrally with the clamping ring (28) 
and extends between the clamping ring (28) and the lower 

surface of the roof trim (48) surrounding the opening. To 
provide sufficient flexibility to cater for roof trim (48) 

of differing thickness, the trim flap (44) is formed of a 
softer material than the rest of the clamping ring (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a motor vehicle having 
an opening roof, the interior of the vehicle roof being 
lined with roof trim and the opening roof comprising a 
frame mounted in an opening in the vehicle roof with a 
portion thereof extending round the vehicle opening below 
the vehicle roof, movable closure means mounted in the 
frame, a clamping ring secured to said portion of the frame 
and having a vertical limb abutting against the underside 
of the vehicle roof adjacent to the roof opening, and a 
trim flap extending between the clamping ring and the lower 
surface of the roof trim surrounding the opening. An opening roof of this type is disclosed in GB-A-2193930 
wherein the trim flap forms part of a trim member 
which is clipped onto the clamping ring. According to the invention, in a vehicle having a 
opening roof of the type described above, the trim flap is 
formed integrally with the clamping ring, the trim flap 
being formed of a softer material than the rest of the 
clamping ring. In one form of the invention, the trim flap and 
the rest of the clamping ring are injection-moulded 
sequentially. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the type of a 
motor car having an opening roof in accordance with the 
invention, with the panel in its open position; Figure 2 is a cross-sectional view taken on the 
line 2-2 in Figure 1, but with the panel in its closed 
position; and Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view similar to 
Figure 2, but showing the invention used with a vehicle 
having thinner interior roof trim than that shown in Figure 
2. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a roof 10 of a motor 
vehicle has a opening which is filled by a panel 12 hinged  
 
along its leading edge 14 to a frame 16 which bounds the 
opening. An opening mechanism 18 at the rear of the panel 
is arranged to hold the panel 12 in a fully open position 
as illustrated in Figure 1 or in a fully closed position in 
which the panel 12 is level with the vehicle roof, as 
illustrated in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2, the frame 16 has a 
vertical portion 20 which projects through the opening in 
the vehicle roof 10, an upper flange 22 which overlies the 
edge of the vehicle roof 10, and a lower flange 24 which 
projects inwardly with respect to with the panel 12 and 
carries a seal 26 for engagement therewith. A clamping ring 28, of inverted T-shaped cross-section 
has its stem 30 engaging with

A motor vehicle having an opening roof, the 
interior of the vehicle roof (46) being lined with roof 

trim (32, 48) and the opening roof comprising a frame (16) 
mounted in an opening in the vehicle roof (46) with a 

portion (20) thereof extending round the vehicle opening 
below the vehicle roof (46), movable closure means (12) 

mounted in the frame (16), a clamping ring (28) secured to 
said portion (20) of the frame (16) and having a vertical 

limb (30) abutting against the underside of the vehicle 
roof (46) adjacent to the roof opening, and a trim flap 

(44) extending between the clamping ring (28) and the lower 
surface of the roof trim (32, 48) surrounding the opening, 

characterised in that the trim flap (44) is formed 
integrally with the clamping ring (28), the trim flap (44) 

being formed of a softer material than the rest of the 
clamping ring (28).
