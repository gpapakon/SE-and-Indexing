<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a mixing of gas into a medium. The method and apparatus in accordance with the present invention are especially applicable in the bleaching plants of the wood processing industry for mixing gaseous bleaching chemicals into pulp and to bleaching process of pulp, in which the mixing method and apparatus in accordance with the present invention are applied. An excellent application is mixing ozone-containing gas into a fiber suspension flowing in a pipe line and an ozone bleaching process. The previously known methods and apparatuses have not been able to mix satisfactorily large volumes of gas, about 50 % of the total volume of the flow, into the medium flow. In the method in accordance with the present invention the mixing is carried out in a strong shear force field efficiently and uniformly, whereafter the fiber network of the medium is allowed to form rapidly and in a controlled manner so that gas is not allowed to separate in the flow as bubbles, but remains in the plug flow in the fiber network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mixing a first medium (gas)
into a second medium (fiber suspension).
The method and
apparatus in accordance with the present invention are
especially suitable for mixing gaseous bleaching
chemicals, such as oxygen or ozone, used in the bleach
plants of the wood processing industry, and for the pulp
bleaching process applying the mixing method and
apparatus in accordance with the present invention. An
excellent application is mixing ozone-containing gas with
fiber suspension such as pulp flowing in a pipe and an ozone bleaching
process.The main objective of the present invention is to develop
a method of and an apparatus for mixing large volumes of
gas into a fiber suspension such as pulp. Further, since the chemical to be
added may be extremely rapidly reacting, such as ozone,
said preconditions set great demands on the method and
apparatus to be developped.In most of the modern bleaching plants very often large
volumes of gas are desired to be mixed into a medium
consistency fiber suspension, which means that the
consistency of the fiber suspension is approximately 10-18
% and it must be possible to mix a large volume of gas
therewith. In other words during the mixing process
approximately 40 to 80 % of the medium is fiber
suspension and approximately 20 to 60 % gas, the
proportion of the gas most usually being approximately 30
to 50 %. It is difficult to have a uniform feed of such a 
large gas volume and to reach a good mixing result,
because gas is separated due to local pressure
differences to areas of lower pressure, if possible. The
non-uniform mixing results on the increase of chemical
loss, which further results in a non-uniform bleaching
and in poorer runnability of the process.The use of above mentioned ozone as a bleaching chemical
in bleaching will become more and more popular in the
future. There is an ongoing transition from pilot testing
to applications in a mill scale, which leads to even
higher demands on the apparatus due to the characteristic
behavior of ozone. Ozone may be produced and used with
the modern technique only in very small proportions,
whereby most (usually more than 90%) of the chemical to
be mixed with the pulp to be bleached is in fact inert
carrier gas compared with the ozone. The result is, of
course, that the volume of the gas to be mixed is large.
Another significant point is that ozone reacts very
rapidly with the material in the fiber suspension. Thus
the mixing must be at the same time both very quick,
efficient and also uniform
