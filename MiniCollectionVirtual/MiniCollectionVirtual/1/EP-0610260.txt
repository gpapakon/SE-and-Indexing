<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates generally to the
prevention of disease in swine. More particularly, the
present invention relates to subunit vaccines for
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.Actinobacillus (formerly Haemophilus)
pleuropneumoniae is a highly infectious porcine
respiratory tract pathogen that causes porcine
pleuropneumonia. Infected animals develop acute
fibrinous pneumonia which leads to death or chronic lung
lesions and reduced growth rates. Infection is
transmitted by contact or aerosol and the morbidity in
susceptible groups can approach 100%. Persistence of the
pathogen in clinically healthy pigs also poses a constant
threat of transmitting disease to previously uninfected
herds.The rapid onset and severity of the disease
often causes losses before antibiotic therapy can become
effective. Presently available vaccines are generally
composed of chemically inactivated bacteria combined with
oil adjuvants. However, whole cell bacterins and surface
protein extracts often contain immunosuppressive
components which make pigs more susceptible to infection.
Furthermore, these vaccines may reduce mortality but do
not reduce the number of chronic carriers in a herd.There are at least 12 recognized serotypes of
A. pleuropneumoniae with the most common in North America 
being serotypes 1, 5 and 7. Differences among serotypes
generally coincide with variations in the electrophoretic
mobility of outer membrane proteins and enzymes thus
indicating a clonal origin of isolates from the same
serotype. This antigenic variety has made the
development of a successful vaccination strategy
difficult. Protection after parenteral immunization with
a killed bacterin or cell free extract is generally
serotype specific and does not prevent chronic or latent
infection. Higgins, R., et al., Can. Vet. J. (1985)
26:86-89; MacInnes, J.I. and Rosendal, S., Infect. Immun.
(1987) 55:1626-1634. Thus, it would be useful to develop
vaccines which protect against both death and chronicity
and do not have immunosuppressive properties. One method
by which this may be accomplished is to develop subunit
vaccines composed of specific proteins in pure or semi-pure
form.A. pleuropneumoniae strains produce several
cytolysins. See, e.g. Rycroft, A.N., et al., J. Gen.
Microbiol. (1991) 137:561-568 (describing a 120 kDa
cytolysin from A. pleuropneumoniae); Chang, Y.F., et al.,

from A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5); Kamp, E.M., et al.,
