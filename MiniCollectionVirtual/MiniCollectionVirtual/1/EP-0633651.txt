<ABSTRACT>
A transformer having galvanically isolated 
windings defines a primary side and a secondary side of a 

power conversion apparatus. A switch couples power from 
a source on the primary side via the transformer to a 

load on the secondary side. A first circuit assembly has 
primary-side circuitry galvanically coupled to a port for 

connection to an input power source. The primary-side 
circuitry includes a primary-side communicator for 

sending or receiving control information used in 
controlling operation of the power conversion apparatus. 

A second circuit assembly has secondary-side circuitry 
galvanically coupled to a port for connection to a load. 

The secondary-side circuitry includes a secondary-side 
communicator for sending or receiving the control 

information. The first and second circuit assemblies are 
mechanically separable as assemblies from one another, 

are galvanically isolated from one another, and are 
configured to be placed in positions relative to one 

another to enable the primary-side and secondary-side 
communicators to cooperate to pass the control 

information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power converter
configuration, control, and construction.Power converters generally include power transfer
components (e.g., transformers and switches) and control
circuitry which governs the operation of the power
transfer components to achieve desired operating
characteristics. For example, in some zero current
switching (ZCS) converters of the kind sold by Vicor
Corporation, Andover, MA (see also United States Patents
4,415,959, 4,441,146, and 4,675,797),
the power transfer components are discrete
components mounted on a printed circuit board.Referring to Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings listed
hereinbelow, in a simple version of a ZCS
converter, a main power transformer 10 has primary and
secondary windings 12, 14 which define primary and
secondary electrical sides 16, 18 of the converter.
Power conversion occurs by quantized transfer of energy
from the primary side to the secondary side during a
succession of energy transfer cycles. Each energy
transfer cycle begins and ends with the closing and
subsequent opening of a switch 20 at times when the
current through the switch is essentially zero.A control circuit 22 governs the opening and
closing of switch 20 so that the energy transfer cycles
occur with a frequency that is varied to cause the
converter to supply the output power at a desired
voltage. A voltage sensor 24 detects Vout and
information about Vout (i.e. control information) is fed
back to a portion of the control circuit which turns the
primary side switch on and off.It is often important (e.g., for safety reasons)
that the primary and secondary sides of the converter be 
isolated from one another. As a result, the transfer of
control information from the secondary to primary sides
is usually done via an isolation device (e.g., a
transformer in which two windings are coupled by a
permeable core, an opto-coupler, or a discrete light
emitting device located adjacent to a discrete light
detecting device) which is included in the control
circuitry.During construction of the converter, the control
circuitry typically is formed by mounting discrete
electronic components on the same circuit board that
bears the power conversion parts, or on separate daughter
boards which form an assembly to be mounted on the main
power conversion board (see our European Patent
Application 93305658.2 published as EP-A-0580390).Powercube Corporation and General Electric
Corporation have offered modular building blocks (e.g.,
AC rectifier blocks, PWM conversion blocks, control
assembly
