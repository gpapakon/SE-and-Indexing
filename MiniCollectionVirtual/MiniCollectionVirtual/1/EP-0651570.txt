<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a television receiver, equipped 
with circuitry means for receiving a plurality of television 

programs, with display means for displaying the image 
corresponding to at least one of which, with a memory for 

storing the tuning data associated to said plurality of 
programs, with command means and control means; the main 

characteristic of the invention consists in the fact that timer 
means are provided for measuring established intervals of time 

and that said control means allow for storing said established 
intervals of time, eventually being different according to the 

program, in said memory, with the aim of informing the user of 
the end of said intervals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a television receiver, equipped
with circuitry means for receiving a plurality of television
programs, with display means for displaying the image
corresponding to at least one of which, with a memory for
storing the tuning data associated to said plurality of
programs, with command means and control means.It is known that the publicity inserts represent for the user of
a television receiver one of the major drawbacks; systems for
identifying such publicity inserts have been proposed, but none
of which have resulted in being satisfactory; in reality an
efficient system would be that in which the broadcaster himself
signals the beginning and end of the insert, for example as is
provided with the known V.P.S. system (Video Programming
System); but it is easy to see that any broadcaster that uses
publicity will never be willing to supply the user with means
for avoiding such; in fact, if someone were to discover a system
for identifying the inserts (for instance based on determined
technical characteristics), the broadcaster would see to
modifying as soon as possible the transmission so as to avoid 
its possible identification.It is known from EP-A-0366001 that a commercial message timer, when enabled by
the user, stores data indicative of a first tuned station and begins timing a
predetermined time period. Upon expiration of the time period, the first tuned
station is automatically reselected if it had been deselected after the timer was
enabled.It is known from EP-A-0384388 the use of a similar timer in response to a channel
change command of a television receiver or in response to the pressing of the
"Pause" key of a VCR. The timer reminds the user, after the expiration of a
determined time period, that the commercial message may be over.Such known methods are not comfortable for the user, because the duration of the
period is either fixed or must be remembered and introduced manually by the user.
It is also known from US-A-4782401 a method and apparatus for controlling the
operation of a video recorder during the recording of a video signal, in order to edit
the commercials from the recording. The apparatus is provided with an automatic
picture break detector which detects dark picture breaks in the video signal, having
a duration greater then a predetermined minimum duration; the lengths of the
commercial is so identified, with the use of the timer, and a rewind circuit is
actuated by the commercial detecting circuit, in order to avoid the recording of the
commercials.S

<CLAIMS>
Television signal receiver, equipped with circuitry means for receiving a plurality
of television programs, associated with display means, for displaying the image

corresponding to at least one of which, with a station memory for storing the
tuning data associated to said plurality of programs, with command means and

control means, and with timer means for measuring the duration of defined
intervals of time and storing said intervals of time, characterised in that, in order

to determine the duration of an advertising insert of a television program, said
command means comprise first means (L) for setting a first functional mode,

second means (E) for setting a second functional mode, third means (B) for
starting, in said first functional mode, the duration measurement, fourth means

(S) for terminating, in said first functional mode, the duration measurement,
wherein said control means provide for storing the value of the measured

duration of the insert of a determined program in said station memory,
associating it with the tuning data of said determined program and wherein said

control means, in said second functional mode, when said third means (B) are
activated, provide for reading out the time stored in said station memory and

associated with the program being, received, and for starting the timer and as
soon as the time counted by the timer is equal to the read out value giving a

warning signal to the user.
Television signal receiver, according to claim 1, further characterised in that said first
means (L), said second means (E), said third means (B) and said fourth means

(S) are keys.
Television signal receiver, according to claim 1, further characterised in that said first
means (L) and said second means (E) are of the reciprocal exclusion type

(bistable).
Television signal receiver, according to claim 1, further characterised in that, in said
first functional mode, when said fourth means (S) are activated, said control

means provide for:

reading the time counted by the timer;
storing the corresponding data in said station memory means, coupled to
the tuning information of the received program.
Television signal receiver, according to claim 1, further characterised in that, in said
second functional mode, when said third means (B) are activated, said control

means provide for:

reading the time data stored in the said station memory, associated to the
program being received;
storing such data in a temporary memory;
zeroing the timer and making it start.
Television signal receiver, according to claim 5, further characterised in that said
control means arrange for activating an attention signal for the user as soon as

the time counted by the timer is equal to or greater than the stored data.
Television signal receiver, according to claim 6, further characterised in that said
attention signal is a visual signal.
Television signal receiver, according to claim 6, further characterised in that said
attention signal is an acoustic signal.
Television signal receiver, according to claim 7, further characterised in that said visual
signal is displayed on the said display means.
Television signal receiver, according to claim 9, further characterised in that said
visual signal is realized making a picture element of the television image flash.
Television signal receiver, according to one or more of the preceding claims, further
characterised in that it comprises a circuit that automatically detects the

presence of a publicity insert and that the end of the publicity insert is
determined with the aid of said timer means.
