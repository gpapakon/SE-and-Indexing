the other node, the intelligent subsystem unit controlling 

auxiliary systems (162) of the at least one other car, the head 
car including an operator console (176) for controlling the train 

through the master node, the method comprising the steps 
of:
 
   transmitting a shutdown signal from the operator 

console to the master node to disable operation of the 
train;
 
   sending in response to the shutdown signal a shutdown 

message from the master node to the at least one other node 
after a delay of a predetermined amount of time, the train 

being in a layup mode during the predetermined amount of 
time wherein the train is not operational but auxiliary 

systems controlled by the intelligent subsystem unit of the 
train are kept running; and
 
   subsequently shutting down power to the intelligent 

subsystem unit with the at least one other node in response 
to receiving the shutdown message at the at least one other 

node after the expiration of the predetermined amount of 
time. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the communication 
network comprises a master/slave communications 

network and the at least one other node is a slave node 
responsive to the master node, the method further 

comprising the steps of:
 
   when a further car (116') containing a second master node 

able to control any slave node in any car is coupled to the  
 

train during the predetermined time that the train is in 
the layup mode, forming a resultant train (212) by establishing 

communication between the second master node and the 
master/slave communications network; and
 
   relinquishing control of any and all slave nodes from 

the first master node to the second master node.  
 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
communication network has a plurality of other nodes and 

respective intelligent subsystem units,
 
   wherein said sending step further comprises sending, 

in response to the shutdown signal, shutdown messages to 
the plurality of other nodes after said delay of a predetermined 

amount of time, and
  
 

   wherein said shutting down step further comprises 
shutting down power to the plurality of intelligent 

subsystem units by the respective other nodes in response to 
receiving the shutdown messages.  

 
An apparatus for placing a multi-car train (112) with a 
communication network in an energy saving layup mode, the 

train including at least a head car (114) and at least one other 
car (118), comprising:
 
   a master node (130A, 130B, 140) on the head car of the train;
 
   a slave node (131A, 131B) on the at least one other car of the 

train;
 
   a train bus (132) interconnecting said master node with said 

slave node;
 
   intelligent subsystem means (121) on the at least one other 

car of the train and coupled to said slave node for 
controlling auxiliary systems (162) for providing comfortable 

conditions in the at least one other car; and
 
   an operator console (176) having a switch and coupled to 

said master node,
 
   wherein said console includes means for sending a 

signal to the master node, whereby keying off said switch 
causes the console to send the signal to said master node,
 
   wherein said master node includes means for sending a 

message to said slave node in response to the signal after 
a delay of a predetermined amount of time, the train being 

in a layup mode during the predetermined amount of time 
wherein the train is not operational but the auxiliary 

systems controlled by the intelligent subsystem of the 
train are kept running, said message to said slave node 

causing said intelligent subsystem to shut down.  
 
An apparatus for laying up a trainline monitor 
system for a train (112), the trainline monitor system having a 

master node (130A, 130B, 140) interconnected to at least 
one other node (131A, 131B) via a 

train bus (132), the train having a head car (114) carrying the master 
node, and at least one other car (118) carrying the at least one 

other node and carrying an intelligent subsystem unit (121) 
including at least one of a heating unit, an air 

conditioning unit, a ventilation unit and a lighting unit (162), 
the intelligent subsystem unit being coupled to the train 

bus by the at least one other node, the apparatus comprising:
 
   a console (176), coupled to the master node, having a switch 

for keying off the train with the master node;
 
   shutdown signal output means in the master node, 

coupled to said console for outputting to the at least one 
other node via the train bus after a delay of a 

predetermined amount of time a shutdown signal in response 
to keying off said console, the train being in a layup mode 

during the predetermined amount of time wherein the train 
is not operational but the auxiliary systems controlled by 

the intelligent subsystem unit of the train are kept 
running; and
 
   shutting down means in the at least one other node, 

coupled to said shutdown signal output means via the train 
bus and to the intelligent subsystem unit, for receiving 

the shutdown signal and for shutting down power to the 
intelligent subsystem unit in dependence on the shutdown 

signal. 
A method for placing a multi-car train (112) in an 
energy saving layup mode in which selected subsystems (162) of 

each car of the train remain powered-up while other subsystems 
(150, 152) of each car are powered off, the train having a communication 

network which includes a communications node (130A, 130B, 140, 131A, 131B) on 
each car (114, 116, 118) of the train, a vehicle bus (142) on each car of the  

 
train coupled to the respective subsystems (121) on the car and 

to the communications node of the car, and a train bus (132) 
running through the train interconnecting the communications 

nodes and communicating with the vehicle buses by way 
of the communication nodes, the method comprising:
 
   transmitting a layup mode message over the communications 

network from one of the nodes to other of the nodes 
instructing the other of the nodes to maintain power for a 

predetermined period of time to the selected subsystems of 
each car of the train and to disconnect power from the 

other subsystems of each car of the train to thereby place 
the train in a layup mode, wherein the train is not operational but the 

selected subsystems are kept running. 
A method as defined in claim 6, wherein the communication 
network comprises a master/slave communications 

network in which the one node constitutes a first master 
node (130A, 130B, 140) and each other node in each other car of the train 

constitutes a slave node (131A, 131B) responsive to the master node, 
said method further comprising:
 
   when a further car (116') containing a second master node 

able to control any slave node in any car is coupled to the 
train during the predetermined time that the train is in 

the layup mode, forming a resultant train (212) by establishing 
communication between the second master nod
e and the 
master/slave communications network; and
 
   relinquishing control of any and all slave nodes from 

the first master node to the second master node.
