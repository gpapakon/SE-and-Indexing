<ABSTRACT>
The cuff band 1 is wrapped around the tip of the 
subject's second finger. When the operator depresses the 

beginning-of-measurement key, the finger tip is pressed at 
various pressures by means of the air pump 3 and the pressure 

sensor 4. Pulse by means of the air pump 3 and the pressure 
sensor 4. Pulse wave signals, M which correspond to 

different pressure values, are automatically measured by the 
optical fingertip plethysmogram sensor 6. The signals are 

transmitted to the CPU 5 through the BPF 7, the amplifier 8, 
and the ADC 9. The CPU 5 performs FFT analyses on the 

signals and determines to which pattern, among the patterns 
stored in ROM 11, the pattern level of the pulse wave 

spectrum for a given pressure value is closest, and displays 
the result on the display unit 10 as a test result indicating 

the viscoelasticity of the subject's peripheral circulation 
tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pulse wave analysis devices that analyses the
condition of the body based on pulse waves obtained from the body.Because people today are subjected to excessive stress, concern has arisen about
sudden, stress-related death and death from fatigue. There is a pressing need for a means
of analysing such symptoms easily and accurately.Against this backdrop, the pulse diagnosis as practised in non-traditional
medicine, such as that exemplified by Ayurveda method in traditional Indian medicine
and by the Chun, Guan, and Chi method in Chinese medicine has attracted considerable
attention. According to this form of pulse diagnosis, a disease can be diagnosed
accurately only when the practising "sage" feels the patient's pulse. It would be
extremely useful if the same diagnosis could be performed by a machine.From the aforementioned standpoint there has been a need for an apparatus
capable of analysing physical symptoms by extracting the information contained in pulse
waves, and the development of such an apparatus has been studied.US 4771790 discloses an electronic blood pressure meter which is adapted to
measure blood pressure from a finger. An air-pressurisable, flexible finger cuff is
adapted to conform to the contour of the finger. The finger cuff comprises a sensor for
detecting pulse wave data by the detection of light reflected by an artery as air pressure
applied by the finger cuff is increased. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure are
computed from the pulse wave amplitudes.The inventors of the present invention have studied the 
relationship between pulse waves and physical health from the
aforementioned standpoint with the intention of developing an
apparatus capable of analyzing the state of one's health
based on pulse waves. Their studies have determined that the
waveform of a pulse wave changes as a function of the
pressure applied at the pressure measurement site. It is
well known that illness is closely related to the dynamic
characteristics of a person's blood vessels. If it is
possible to determine objectively the behavior of pulse waves
with respect to applied pressure, the diagnosis of a
patient's illness will be greatly improved both in terms of
speed and objectivity. The present invention was developed
against this background. Its objective is to provide a pulse
wave analysis device capable of determining the behavior of
pulse waves with respect to applied pressure in an objective
manner.For the implementation of the system identified above,
