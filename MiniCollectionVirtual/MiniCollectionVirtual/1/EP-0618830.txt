<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to centrifugal 
processing systems and apparatus. Today blood collection organizations 
routinely separate whole blood by centrifugation into 
its various therapeutic components, such as red blood 
cells, platelets, and plasma.  
 Conventional blood processing systems and 
methods use durable centrifuge equipment in 
association with single use, sterile processing 
chambers, typically made of plastic. The centrifuge 
equipment introduces whole blood into these chambers 
while rotating them to create a centrifugal field. Whole blood separates within the rotating 
chamber under the influence of the centrifugal field 
into higher density red blood cells and platelet-rich 
plasma. The platelet-rich plasma is then further 
separated in a second stage into platelet concentrate 
and platelet-poor plasma. Conventional wisdom believes that the 
processing volume for the second stage of separation 
should exceed the processing volume for the first 
stage. The larger processing volume is thought to 
give the platelets more time to separate, or sediment, 
from the platelet-rich plasma. The larger processing 
volume is also thought to protect the platelets from 
damage and activation due to shear stress during 
processing. The inventors have discovered that these 
conventional perceptions are not correct. The 
invention provides improved blood processing systems 
and methods that create unique dynamic flow conditions 
within a processing chamber of considerable smaller 
processing volume than conventional platelet 
separation chambers. The result is a surprising and 
significant increase in platelet collection 
efficiencies. The invention provides a chamber and 
associated method for separating platelets from a 
platelet suspension. The invention provides 
separation zone that, in use, is rotated about an axis  
 
at a given angular velocity (Ω). The separation zone 
includes a low-G side located closer to the rotational 
axis than the other, high-G side to create between 
them a chamber having a radial thickness (h) and an 
axial height (Z) measured with respect to the axis of 
rotation. An inlet introduces blood having a given 
kinematic viscosity (ν) into the chamber. The invention provides a separation zone 
having a relationship between its radial thickness (h) 
and the axial height (Z) that, taking into account the 
given angular velocity (Ω) of rotation and the given 
kinematic viscosity (ν) of blood introduced through 
the inlet, represents a (λ) value that is less than 
700,
