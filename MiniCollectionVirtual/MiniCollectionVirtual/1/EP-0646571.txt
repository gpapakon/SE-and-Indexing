 is part of a 
saturated, unsaturated or aromatic heterocyclic five- to 

seven-membered ring which can also include up to two 
further heteroatoms from the group consisting of nitrogen, 

oxygen and sulfur or up to two keto functions and 
can, in addition, be benzo-fused,
 
by reacting NH compounds of the general formula II 


 
with acetylene at temperatures from 140 to 180°C and at 

pressures of from 15 to 22 bar in the presence of compounds 
of the platinum metals as catalysts, which comprises 

diluting the acetylene in the reactor in an inert 
gas in a volume ratio of from 6:1 to 0.5:1 and injecting 

further acetylene at the rate at which it is consumed. 
A process for preparing N-vinyl compounds I as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein the acetylene in the reactor 

is diluted with nitrogen in a volume ratio of from 5:1 to  
 

1:1. 
A process for preparing N-vinyl compounds I as 
claimed in claim 1 or 2 using palladium(II) compounds, 

osmium(III) compounds or ruthenium(III) compounds as 
catalysts. 
A process for preparing N-vinyl compounds I as 
claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, where the catalysts are 

employed without support material. 
A process for preparing N-vinyl compounds I as 
claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, where the reaction is 

carried out in an inert organic solvent. 
A process for preparing N-vinyl compounds I as 
claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, where the group R
1
-N-R
2
 
is part of a saturated, unsaturated or aromatic 

heterocyclic five- to seven-membered ring which can also 
contain a further nitrogen atom or an oxygen atom or up 

to two keto functions and can, in addition, be benzofused. 
A process for preparing N-vinyl compounds I as 
claimed in claim 6 by reacting 2-pyrrolidone, imidazole 

or ε-caprolactam.
