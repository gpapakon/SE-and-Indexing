<ABSTRACT>
A transducer assembly and method for the ultrasonic 
inspection of tubing. An elastic membrane is used to form a 

reservoir of ultrasonic fluid coupled to ultrasonic 
transducers with the membrane conforming to the surface of 

the tubing being inspected. Guide wheels maintain the 
membrane out-of-contact with the tubing during relative 

rotational movement of the assembly and tubing during 
inspection. Water is introduced between the membrane and the 

tubing to provide ultrasonic coupling of the tubing to the 
transducers through the fluid of the reservoir.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the ultrasonic
inspection of pipe and tubing to determine characteristics
thereof, such as wall thickness or defects, and to a
transducer assembly for use with this method.Incident to the manufacture or use of tubular products,
it is common practice to inspect the tubing for detection of
variations in the wall thickness thereof and to detect the
presence of surface and internal defects. For this purpose,
it is known to use ultrasonic inspection techniques. With
these techniques, it is customary to employ a transducer to
impart high-frequency sound energy into the tubing to be
tested. The high-frequency sound energy is transmitted
through an ultrasonic fluid to the tubing and is reflected
back from the tubing to the transducer. Monitoring of this
back reflection of the sound energy is used to determine
characteristics such as wall thickness and the presence of
defects in the form of discontinuities in the tubing.With inspection techniques of this type, relative
rotational movement is imparted between the tubing being
inspected and the transducer assembly used for the
inspection. To achieve precise and reliable test results, it
is necessary to maintain effective ultrasonic coupling
between the transducers and the surface of the tubing during
this relative rotational movement. This necessitates a
transducer assembly having a surface coupled to the
transducers that conforms to the contour of the surface of
the tubing being inspected. To maintain this contact, it is 
desirable that the contacting surface of the transducer
assembly be of a material that will deform into conformity
with the tubing contour. For effective ultrasonic coupling,
contact of the conforming material must be maintained while
effecting relative rotational movement of the tubing surface
and the conforming material of the transducer assembly. This
results in rapid wear and destruction of this conforming
surface of the transducer assembly and thus necessitates
frequency removal and replacement. If the surface is
attempted to be maintained in light contact to avoid wear and
abrasion thereof, this results in ineffective ultrasonic
coupling of the transducers and thus imprecise and unreliable
test results.US Patent No. 3 798 961 discloses an apparatus for non-destructive
testing using an ultrasonic probe. The apparatus has a casing which has
a bore and is closed at one end by a flexible diaphragm and at the other
end by the probe. The casing is filled with liquid and bearing elements
