<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of ultrasonic welding of
porous polymers.Ultrasonic welding has been known for some time to be a useful
and practical method of fabricating articles from sheets of polymeric
materials by applying ultrasonic energy to the overlapped edges of the
sheets of polymeric materials to weld them together. These methods
have been applied to welding sheets of porous polymers to other sheets
of either porous or non-porous materials. For example, Abe, U.S.P.
4,770,730, teaches ultrasonic welding of non-porous covering materials
to the surface of elastic foam materials by the application of
alternating high and low pressure applied from an ultrasonic horn
wherein ultrasonic energy is only applied during the reduced pressure
portion of the cycle. This method allows the welding of covering
materials to foam seat cushions by taking advantage of the elasticity
of the foam. The method results in an impermeable construction by
welding an impermeable covering material over the foam.Bowman, U.S.P. 4,283,448, describes a method of joining segments
of shrinkable expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene by abutting
edges of the segments, applying pressure perpendicular to the edges
and parallel to the segment surface, restraining the segment from
shrinking in any direction and heating the material to above the
crystalline melt point of the polytetrafluoroethylene (hereinafter
PTFE). While this method joins the abutted edges and maintains the
porosity of the abutted edges, it requires heating the entire segment
while restraining the segment from shrinkage. Bowman does not suggest
the use of ultrasound energy as a means of joining adjacent sheets of
porous polytetrafluoroethylene. Primm, U.S.P. 4,957,669, teaches the use of ultrasonic
energy applied to a tapered metal mandrel for forming
tapered vascular grafts from untapered vascular graft
tubing of porous expanded PTFE.Ultrasonic energy has also been used for the
manufacture of porous non-woven webbing by a method taught
by Wang et al, U.S.P. 4,406,720.U.S.P. 4,247,345 to Kadija et al describes the joining
together of synthetic materials to create reinforced
liquid-tight seams by placing a strip of thermoplastic
sealing material between two overlapping edges of the
synthetic materials to be joined, sewing through the
resulting three layers and applying ultrasonic energy to
melt the thermoplastic strip and form the seal.GB 2,237,279 A describes the use of ultrasound to
sinter crystalline PTFE.E.P.A. 0051957 describes a method for producing a
