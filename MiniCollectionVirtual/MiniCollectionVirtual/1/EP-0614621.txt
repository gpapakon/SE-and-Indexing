<ABSTRACT>
Device (1) for holding a covering (12) in front of the pubic area of 
a user, for example a textile covering such as a tanga, comprising a 

bracket (2) for engaging the groin area of the user on either side of 
the pubic area and the os sacrum and for supporting a covering, and 

securing means (4) which can be brought into securing engagement with 
the proximal side of the sphincter of the user so as to thereby be 

secured into place, wherein the securing means (4) are substantially 
rigidly connected to the bracket (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a holder for a covering or the 
like for the pubic area of a user, for example a textile 
covering such as a tanga. Normally briefs are used for covering the pubic area. 
These are characterized by a piece of fabric covering the 
buttock area, a piece of fabric covering the pubic area 
and more or less wide strips of fabric which connect these 
two together. Although as a rule such garments remain well 
in place on the user's body during a variety of activities, 
they have the disadvantage that for reasons of a 
normative nature a larger area of the user's body than is 
strictly necessary is covered and is not for example accessible 
for sunrays. An improvement on this is the tanga, where either the 
previously mentioned wide strips of fabric guided over the 
user's sides are replaced by thin straps or the portion 
covering the buttock area is absent and the portion covering 
the pubic area is held in position by means of straps 
guided through the anal cleft and around the user's sides. 
Although here the covered surfaces protected from the sun 
rays are relatively small, the tanga still has the disadvantage 
that after sunbathing stripes can be visible on 
the skin, particularly on the side. Apart from that in the 
case of male users it is only with difficulty that the 
tanga retains its close fit, because the portion covering  
 
the pubic area is only held in place by the straps, which 
merely exert a laterally directed force on that portion. Furthermore, tanga-like garments are known with a spring-like 
bracket and a piece of fabric placed thereover, the 
bracket being held in position by engaging about the mons 
veneris with a triangular shaped bracket part at the front 
and by engaging in the anal cleft at the back (see for example US-A-3 339 208). By means of 
this garment, that is particularly intended for women, the 
user's sides are thus freed from covering fabric parts. A 
disadvantage of this is, however, that the attachment to 
the user's body is not secure. Because of this, in particular 
in the case of female users, the bracket can start 
sliding laterally or, as a consequence of the user bending 
down, whereby the abdomen exerts a displacing pressure on 
the bracket, in a downward direction, as a result of which 
the pubic area may then become partially exposed. An object of the invention is to provide a holder of the 
kind mentioned in the preamble, which can leave the user's 
sides completely exposed, but still can be held in a very 
secure and pleasant way

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for holding a covering, cover or other 
objects in front of the pubic area of a user, for example 

a textile covering such as a tanga, comprising first 
carrier means (2, 3) which include a groin-engaging portion for engaging the groin area of the 

user on either side of the pubic area and for supporting said 
covering, cover (22), or other objects and characterised by securing means (4) which can be brought 

into a securing engagement with the proximal side of the 
sphincter of the user so as to thereby be secured into 

place, wherein the securing means are substantially rigidly 
connected to the groin-engaging portion of the first carrier means. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein at the position of 
the securing means (4) the first carrier means (2, 3) 

connect to second carrier means (2, 23) which are joined 
with the first carrier means and are designed for for the 

engagement of the area of the anal cleft near the os 
coccygis. 
Device according to claim 2, wherein the second carrier 
means (2,23) comprise portions (13) for the engagement of 

the area near the os sacrum. 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the second 
carrier means (2, 23) are connected to the securing means 

(4) in a substantially rigid manner. 
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the first carrier means (2, 3) and/or the second 

carrier means (2, 23) are elastically deformable in the  
 

symetrical plane of the user. 
Device according to any one of the previous claims, 
wherein the first carrier means (2, 3) comprise two rod 

shaped parts (5, 6) extending on either side of the pubic 

area, which can be biassed in a direction turned away from 
each other. 
Device according to any one of the claims 2 to 6, 
wherein the first carrier means (2, 3) and the second 

carrier means (2, 23) are integral with one another, 
preferably in the form of a wire (2', 2'') e.g. a bracket 

made of metal wire. 
Device according to any one of the previous claims, 
wherein the securing means (4) comprise a base attached to 

the first carrier means (2, 3), a head part (18) provided 
with surfaces (20) engaging the proximal side of the 

sphincter, and a shaft (17) connecting the base with the 
head part (18). 
Device according to claim 8, wherein the head part (18) 
is provided with surfaces for indirectly pressing against 

the prostrate gland and/or is provided with surfaces (21) 
for indirectly pressing against the musculus levator ani. 
Device according to any one of the previous claims, 
wherein the first carrier means (2, 3) and/or the second 

carrier means (2, 23) are provided with pressure means for 
for acupressure purposes.
