<ABSTRACT>
A new method of friction welding, particularly suitable 
for manufacturing BLISKS and BLUMS for gas turbine engine 

rotors, in which the disc or drum rotor is angularly 
reciprocated while the airfoil blades are pressed 

radially against the rotor circumference. A machine for 
carrying out the method has a workpiece holder and a 

counterbalancing member mounted for angular reciprocation 
and coupled together by torque transfer means to 

constitute a resonant system. In operation the machine 
is driven at or near its natural frequency of 

oscillation. The natural frequency is tunable by 
adjusting the stiffness of the torque transfer means. A 

drive means is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to friction welding. It has been known for many years that two components, even metal 
components can be welded together by rubbing the components one 
against the other and urging them together. The frictional heat 
generated between the components melts, or at least softens, the 
material of one component, and more usually both components, so as to 
form a friction weld. It is known to friction weld by producing 
relative rotary motion. It is known to friction weld by producing 
relative orbital motion. It is known to friction weld by producing 
relative linear reciprocatory motion. One example of a technical field in which friction welding is 
currently seen as having useful applications is in the field of 
making compressors or turbines for aircraft engines. Compressor 
assemblies may comprise a blisk (blades plus integral disc), or a 
blum (blades plus integral drum) which is effectively several blisks 
joined together. According to a first aspect of the invention we provide a method of 
friction welding a component to a circular workpiece having an axis 
of symmetry comprising urging the component against a circumference 
of the workpiece, producing relative rubbing movement between the 
component and the workpiece, and when sufficient frictional heating 
has occurred ceasing the rubbing movement and urging the component 
and the workpiece together with a weld-pressure generating force 
substantially perpendicular to the circumference, the method being 
characterised in that said relative rubbing movement is angularly 
reciprocal about the axis of symmetry of the circular workpiece. Thus the two components move in a new angular reciprocatory manner to 
and fro relative to each other.  
 This is a departure from previous friction welding techniques and 
allows us to weld simultaneously several radial blades to disc using 
angular friction welding. The weld-pressure generating force may be applied radially relative 
to the axis about which angular reciprocatory movement occurs, or 
axially, or in a combination of these directions. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided 
apparatus for performing the method of friction welding comprising a 
first component holder for holding the workpiece having an axis of 
symmetry, at least one second component holder for holding a second 
component to be welded to the workpiece, movement generating means 
for producing relative movement between the first component holder 
and the second component holder, and means for
