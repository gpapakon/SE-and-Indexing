<ABSTRACT>
The fire-detecting system contains detectors with sensors (1) for monitoring fire characteristics. The sensors (1) generate corresponding sensor signals (S) which are fed to an analytical stage (evaluation stage) (3). The probability (W) of a future false alarm is estimated in this analytical stage and an indication signal is output if the probability has a specific magnitude.

Method for avoiding false alarms in a fire alarm
system, with a plurality of alarms connected to a

central control, which have at least one sensor for
monitoring fire parameters and for supplying

corresponding sensor signals, from which, in a signal
processing operation comprising a comparison of the

sensor signal (S) with a threshold value (G1) lying
below a danger level, danger signals are deduced by

comparison with corresponding danger levels,

characterised in that
 the signal processing operation
contains the following further steps:


a. counting the number of times the threshold value
(G1) mentioned is exceeded over a first interval

(T) of predetermined length;
b. comparing the result of the count with a
predetermined value and supplying an advisory

signal of a possible false alarm, if the
predetermined value has been exceeded.
