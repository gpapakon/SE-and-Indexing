<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to gas generants, such as 
are used in automotive airbag inflators, and particularly to 
processing aids for gas generants which contain high levels of 
metal oxides present as hard particles. Such metal oxides may 
function as oxidizers, slag modifiers, or as simple flow agents. Gas generant formulations for automotive airbags contain as 
a minimum, a fuel and an oxidizer. Additionally it may contain 
other ingredients to modify the nature of the slag produced in 
the combustion process, to increase the burning rate, to cool the 
composition, or to function as a processing aid. Such 
formulations are commonly formed into pellets for insertion into 
an inflator device by rotary pressing equipment or other pressing 
equipment using a system of dies and punches as described for 
example in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,561,675 and 4,547,342. 
Gas generants containing significant levels of metal oxides 
present as hard particles are pressed into pellets with great 
difficulty as manifest by the high release load required to 
remove the pellets from the dies. This in turn is manifest in a 
high rate of wear on the dies and punches as described for example in U.S. Patent No. 4931111 
. It is common practice 
to include processing aids such as water, graphite powder, 
molybdenum disulfide, boron nitride, or salts of fatty acids into 
the formulations to reduce the force required to remove the  
 
pellets from the dies, and hence results in a reduction in tool 
wear which also reduces the cost of producing the gas generant as described for example in EP-A-519 485. 
Many compositions cannot be mass produced into pellets without 
the use of a processing aid and thus processing aids are a very 
important part of the gas generant formulation. It is recognized by those skilled in the art that processing 
aids themselves either become fuels, oxidizers, or inert 
ingredients within any gas generant formulation and contribute to 
the overall properties of the composition such as burning rate, 
mechanical strength, gas toxicity, and ability to form easily 
filterable slag. In general it is most desirable to use a 
processing aid at the lowest level possible. Blending the 
processing aid to a previously prepared gas generant powder of 
prilled composition rather than incorporating the processing aid 
into the bulk composition also greatly increases its 
effectiveness. Salts of fatty acids (for example, calcium or magnesium 
stearate) used in formulations containing transition metal oxides 
have

<CLAIMS>
A gas generant composition comprising 

(a) between 15 and 70 wt.% fuel, 
(b) between 20 and 80 wt.% oxidizer, and 
(c) between 0.05 and 2 wt.% of a release aid 

comprising a mixture of mica and a salt of a fatty acid, 
and wherein the gas generant 

composition comprises at least 5 wt.% of a metal oxide or metalloid oxide 
which may either function as an oxidizer and thus be a 

portion of said oxidizer (b) or serve another function. 
A gas generant composition in accordance with 
claim 1 wherein said mica is muscovite mica. 
A gas generant composition in accordance with 
claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said mica and said salt of a 

fatty acid are present at ratios of between 1:4 and 4:1. 
A gas generant composition in accordance with 
any preceding claim wherein said fatty acid salt is a salt 

of a fatty acid having between 10 and 30 carbon atoms. 
A gas generant composition in accordance with 
any preceding claim wherein said fatty acid salt has a 

cation selected from calcium, zinc, and magnesium.
