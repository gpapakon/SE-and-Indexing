<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic resin
compositions, and specifically to polymeric compositions comprising
styrenic and polyamide resins, which exhibit excellent impact
strengths at low temperatures.Polyamide resins, due to their strong resistance to chemicals
and good processability, are widely used for parts of automobiles,
electrical and electronic appliances. The impact strength, and
particularly the notched impact strength, of molded products made
of polyamide resins are, however, poor. Thus, in recent years,
intensive research efforts have been focused on the improvement
of the impact strength by adding thermoplatic elastomers to the
polyamides, and such improved polyamide blends are disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4321336.Polystyrene resins used in various applications, are relatively
poor in their processability, resistance to chemicals, and heat
resistance in particular when compared with polyamide resins.
Thus, various processes for improving physical and chemical
properties by compounding polyamides with styrenic resins have
been developed. However, a simple blending of styrenic and
polyamide resins, due to their mutual compatibility, results in a
severe phase separation or delamination in their molded products.U.S. Patent No. 4321336 discloses high impact polyamide
blends consisting of one or more constituents taken from among
aliphatic polyolefins, olefinic copolymers, styrenic copolymers,
polymers of aliphatic dienes, acrylonitriles and
polydimethylsiloxane, and polyamides. As disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4496690, there are polymer compositions comprising a 
polyamide and a resin selected from the group consisting of
copolymers consisting of a styrene, an acrylonitrile and an
ethylene-unsaturated carbonamide, and graft polymers thereof on a
rubber substrate polymer. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
2-240158 discloses high impact thermoplastic resin compositions
comprising ABS(acrylonitnile/butadiene/styrene) resins, polyamide
resins, and modified styrenic copolymers. Also disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2-311545 are high impact
thermoplastic resin compositions comprising copolymers of maleic
imides, polyamides, modified polyolefins, and ABS resins.A related subject matter is disclosed in EP-A-0 402 528 which also deals with
impact resistant thermoplastic resin compositions.All the thermoplastic resin compositions, as disclosed in the
aforementioned patents or patent applications, retain satisfactory
impact strengths at room temperature. Their impact strengths,
