 COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF TREATING HEPATITIS B I. GOVERNMENT INTEREST This invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment to us of any royalties thereon. II. RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/878,372, filed September 13, 1991 which in turn is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/759,544, filed September 13, 1991. III. FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates generally to the pharmacological treatment of hepatitis B virus infection in patients. IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious worldwide problem that affects millions of patients. Consequences of infection include acute liver failure, cirrhosis with chronic liver failure, and an increased risk for the development of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of acute HBV infection has been increasing in the United States. Among patients with acute hepatitis B infection, possible outcomes include death, resolution of disease, or development of a chronic infection state. The latter can be characterized histologically as a chronic active hepatitis, chronic persistent 

hepatitis, or an asymptomatic chronic carrier state. Alternately, the chronic process can be described in terms of molecular events as replicative vs.non-replicative. Efforts aimed towards hepatitis B treatment have been underway for a number of years. Most interest recently has focused on the use of interferon alpha which has been studied in a number of controlled trials. Greenberg et. al. first reported on the inhibition of viral replication using leukocyte interferon. Several small trials after this demonstrated varying degrees of efficacy, (Lok et. al., 1984; Thomas HC et. al. 1985; Scully et. al., 1985) which was partially accounted for by the demographic characteristics of the population studied. Use of recombinant interferon alpha was first reported in 1983 (Smith et. al.). Recombinant interferon permits better standardization of dose and drug activity than is provided by the mixed interferon products previously utilized. The efficacy of therapy for HBV is measured in various ways depending on the study being examined. The first prospective, randomized, controlled trial utilizing recombinant interferon alpha came from a group at the National Institutes of Health. In this study 45 patients were randomized into three groups in which they were given 5
