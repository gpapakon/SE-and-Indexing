with the respective pairs of rolling rolls (17) of the block 

of fast rolling mill stands (11-12), a first guide box (15) 
for round sections which is positioned upstream of the first 

pair (11) of rolling rolls (17v), a second guide box (20)

at least two sections (13) from the rolling plane of the 
first pair of rolling rolls (17v)

to that rolling plane, a third guide box (24) with rolls 

which receives oval sections and aligns the same on the 
rolling plane of the second pair of rolling rolls (17o) and 

a fourth guide box (23) which receives round sections and 
displaces the sections (13) at least partly from the rolling 

plane of the second pair of rolling rolls (17o) to a plane 
perpendicular to that rolling plane, the fourth guide box 

(23) being followed by a fifth box which aligns the round 
sections on the rolling plane of the third pair of rolling 

rolls (17v), and so on in this sequence for the other pairs  
 

of rolling rolls (17v-17o), the second, third and fourth 
guide boxes (20-24-23) displacing the sections (13a-13b)

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a system to roll at least two 
sections in blocks of fast rolling mill stands, as set forth 
in the main claim. The blocks of fast rolling mill stands according to the 
invention in a rolling plant are located downstream of a 
train of conventional rolling mill stands and upstream of a 
cooling line comprising a cooling plate. The invention is applied to the situation where rolled 
products sheared to size are obtained on the cooling plate. The rolling mill stands with which the invention is 
concerned are called commercially "blocks of fast rolling 
mill stands" and consist typically of a plurality of 
alternate pairs of rolls positioned as cantilevers with 
their axes rotated by ninety degrees to the next pair so as 
to process, for instance, oval sections followed by round 
sections followed by oval sections followed by round 
sections and so on. These fast rolling mill stands can roll at 60 to 80 metres 
per second or more up to 120 to 140 metres per second. In the blocks of fast rolling mill stands with which the 
invention is concerned the distance between the centre of 
one pair of rolling rolls and the centre of the next pair of 
rolling rolls is generally between 600 to 1200 millimetres. It is known that the rolled product leaving the fast 
rolling mill stands undergoes an in-line cooling process 
carried out by feeding the rolled product into a cooling 
station consisting of cooling plates after the rolled 
product has been sheared to size. It is also known that the maximum speed which can be 
reached in the entry channel of a cooling plate is about 20  
 
to 30 metres per second in the double channels but more 
usually 12 to 20 metres per second in the roller conveyors 
owing to reasons linked to the handling and discharge of 
the bars of rolled stock. Owing to the above the advantages connected to the use of 
these blocks of fast rolling mill stands are therefore 
substantially lessened, because also of the fact that these 
blocks of the state of the art can be employed only to roll 
one profile at a time. The state of the art includes the so-called "splitting 
process" to increase the speed of processing of the rolled 
stock, this process consisting in processing at the same 
time two or more sections obtained by splitting a double 
initial rolled product. In the state of the art this process has never been 
employed in fast rolling mill stand blocks owing to the 
difficulties linked to the rotation of the rolling plane 
from the horizontal to the vertical where
