<ABSTRACT>
The use of apolipoprotein B as an endothelin 
converting enzyme. Apolipoprotein B itself has endothelin-converting 

enzyme activity and is useful for screening an 
inhibitor against the endothelin converting enzyme.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
the use of apolipoprotein B as an endothelin converting
enzyme.Endothelin is an endothelial cell-derived vascular
smooth muscle constricting factor discovered by Yanagisawa
et al. in 1988, the presence of which has been identified in
porcine, bovine and human or the like [M. Yanagisawa et al.,
Nature, Vol. 332, 411 (1988)].Endothelin includes three types of isopeptides
which are named endothelin-1, endothelin-2 and endothelin-3,
respectively. Of these isopeptides, endothelin-1 has been
confirmed to show the highest activity in human body.
Endothelin, having strong and lasting action of constricting
vascular smooth muscle cell and trachea, induces
hypertension and constriction of respiratory tract and also
induces at a high concentration (about 1 - 50 pmol/ml in
blood level) ischemic cerebral and cardiac diseases such as
cerebral apoplexy, strenocardia, myocardial infarction,
cardiac incompetence and arrhythmia, nephropathy such as
nephritis, circulatory failure of lung, liver and intestine,
and asthma, thus sometimes bringing animals to the death. Endothelin-1 is a 21-amino acid peptide which is
produced by cleaving its precursor peptide, big endothelin-1
of the formula:

with the endothelin converting enzyme at the bond between
the tryptophane residue at the 21st position from the N-terminus
and the valine residue at the 22nd position from
the N-terminus (shown by the downward arrow). This
hydrolysis process is considered to be essential for
production of endothelin-1 in vivo. Endothelin converting
enzymes of bovine origin are those derived from cultured
bovine endothelial cells or the like [K. Okada et al.,
Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 171,
No. 3, 1192 (1990)] and those derived from bovine adrenal
medulla [T. Sawamura et al., Biochemical and Biophysical
Research Communications, 168, No. 3, 1230 (1990)].
Regarding endothelin converting enzymes of human origin, WO
92/13944 discloses those prepared from human lung.Endothelin having remarkable physiological
activities as described above is produced enzymatically from
its precursor i.e. big endothelin. Therefore, the 
elucidation of the endothelin converting enzyme will provide
a means for inhibiting the production of endothelin in vivo.
In addition, this endothelin converting enzyme is expected
to provide a useful reagent for analyzing the mechanism of
vasoconstriction in vivo and for studying various diseases
induced by endothelin.Further, the elucidation of the endothelin
converting enzyme (ECE) will
