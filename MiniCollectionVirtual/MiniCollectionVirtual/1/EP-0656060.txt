<ABSTRACT>
A DNA sequence (-426 to +28 base pairs) cloned from the probasin (PB) gene promoter region confers androgen regulation in cell culture and prostate specific expression in transgenic non-human eukaryotic animals. Various PB promoter fragments impart preferential regulation by androgens compared to other steroid hormones on fused transgenes. Alteration of the DNA sequences and/or combinations permits production of an (1) assay for androgenic or anti-androgenic materials, (2) transgenic non-human eukaryotic animals models for prostatic disease, (3) cell culture models for prostatic disease, and (4) treatment of human benign prostatic hyperplasia and human prostate cancer by gene therapy. This invention permits assays on agonist and antagonist of the androgen receptor or pathways that result in androgen action, testing materials for carcinogenicity of the prostate, testing drugs and gene therapy, or protection potential of materials on prostatic cells against prostatic disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a novel DNA molecule and fragments thereof, which permits production of an (1) assay for androgenic or anti-androgenic materials, (2) transgenic non-human eukaryotic animals models for prostatic disease, (3) cell culture models for prostatic disease, and (4) treatment of human benign prostatic hyperplasia and human prostate cancer by gene therapy. This invention permits assays on agonist and antagonist of the androgen receptor or pathways that result in androgen action, testing materials for carcinogenicity on the prostate, testing drugs and gene therapy, or protection potential of materials on prostatic cells against prostatic disease.Androgen Activity: A clinical need to assay the function of the androgen receptor (AR) occurs when defects appear in the pathway of androgen action. For example, mutations in the AR affect the bioactivity of the receptor in Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, AIS, (Kazemi-Esfarjani et al., 1993; Brinkmann et al., 1991; Brinkmann et al., 1992a; Brinkmann et al., 1992b; De Bellis et al., 1992; French et al., 1990; Imperato-McGinley et al., 1990; Lubahn et al., 1989; Quigley et al., 1992; Ris-Stalpers et al., 1990; Ris-Stalpers et al., 1991; Simental et al., 1992) or testicular feminized animals (Yarbrough et al., 1990; He et al., 1991), Kennedy Syndrome (La Spada et al., 1991), prostate cancer (Newmark et al., 1992; Brinkmann et al., 1991; Veldscholte et al., 1992b; Veldscholte et al., 1992a; Veldscholte et al., 1990) and breast cancer (Wooster et al., 1992). Besides mutations directly in the receptor, defects can occur in the non-androgenic mechanism for steroid receptor activation as has been reported for steroid receptors (Power et al., 1991; Shemshedini et al., 1992; Kuiper et al., 1993). An assay that would measure the extent of these defects would also provide a tool to test new materials that may activate the defective receptor and form the basis of a therapy.Androgen receptors are members of a nuclear receptor superfamily which are believed to function primarily as transcription factors that regulate gene activity through binding specific DNA sequences to hormone responsive elements (HRE) and associated factors (Allan et al., 1991; Smith et al., 1993; Evans, 1988; Beato, 1989). In general, these HREs can be grouped into two categories of inverted repeat consensus sequences: the TGACC motif that mediates estrogen, retinoic acid, and thyroid hormone responses (Klein-Hitpass et al., 1986; Umesono et al., 1988) ; and the TGTTCT
