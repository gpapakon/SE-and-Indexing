<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of multi-branched paraffins 
comprising contacting a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially 

boiling in the gasoline range which feedstock comprises linear 
paraffins having at least five carbon atoms in a first reaction 

stage in the presence of hydrogen and at elevated temperature and 
pressure with a first isomerisation catalyst which comprises a 

molecular sieve comprising pores with a diameter D1 and at least one 
Group VIII metal component to produce mono-branched paraffins, and 

subsequently contacting at least part of the effluent so obtained in 
a second reaction stage at elevated temperature and pressure and in 

the presence of hydrogen with a second isomerisation catalyst 
comprising pores with a diameter D2 and at least one Group VIII

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of multi-branched paraffins from a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock 
substantially boiling in the gasoline range which comprises linear 
paraffins having at least five carbon atoms. One of the main objects in nowaday's oil refining is to produce 
gasolines fulfilling the increasing environmental demands on product 
quality and having a high octane number. This means for gasoline that the octane specification has now 
to be established for instance without lead-containing additives, 
less aromatics, in particular benzene, and less olefins. Components which contribute to the octane quality of gasoline 
include branched paraffins, in particular multi-branched paraffins. 
Object of the present invention is to provide multi-branched 
paraffins, in particular multi-branched C₇ paraffins which are very 
attractive high octane gasoline components. It has now been found that remarkably high yields of multi-branched 
paraffins, in particular multi-branched C₇ paraffins 
predominantly existing of double-branched C₇ paraffins, can be 
obtained from a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling in 
the gasoline range which feedstock comprises linear paraffins having 
at least five carbon atoms when use is made of a specific two-stage 
isomerisation process. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of multi-branched paraffins comprising contacting a 
hydrocarbonaceous feedstock substantially boiling in the gasoline 
range which feedstock comprises linear paraffins having at least 
five carbon atoms in a first reaction stage in the presence of 
hydrogen and at elevated temperature and pressure with a first 
isomerisation catalyst which comprises a molecular sieve comprising 
pores with a diameter D1 and at least one Group VIII metal component  
 
to produce mono-branched paraffins, and subsequently contacting at 
least part of the effluent so obtained in a second reaction stage at 
elevated temperature and pressure and in the presence of hydrogen 
with a second isomerisation catalyst comprising pores with a 
diameter D2 and at least one Group VIII metal component to produce 
multi-branched paraffins, whereby D1/D2 is at most 1. In the context of the present invention diameter D1 is defined 
as the largest average pore diameter present in the molecular sieve 
crystallites composing the catalyst, whereas diameter D2 is defined 
as the largest average pore diameter present in the component of the 
second isomerisation
