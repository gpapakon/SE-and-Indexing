<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dye-donor elements 
used in thermal dye transfer, and more particularly to 
the use of 4-nitro-pyrazol-5-yl-azoaniline magenta 
dyes. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and 
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the 
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained 
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a 
screen. Further details of this process and an 
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S. 
Pat. No. 4,621,271. A problem has existed with the use of certain 
dyes in dye-donor elements for thermal dye transfer 
printing. Many of the dyes proposed for use do not 
have adequate stability to light. Others do not have 
good hue. It would be desirable to provide dyes which  
 
have bright hue, good solubility in coating solvents, 
good transfer efficiency and good light stability. U.S. Patent 4,764,178 broadly describes 
heterocyclic-azoaniline dyes of the formula: 
A-N=N-E 
wherein A is the "residue of a diazotizable 
heteroaromatic amine" including aminopyrazoles among 
several others. While nitro is broadly described as a 
substituent for the group of heterocycles "A", the only 
substituent specifically disclosed in the 4-position of 
the pyrazole ring is cyano (col. 2, lines 27-31 and 56; 
col. 4 lines 48-56; and Table 1, Dyes 2-13). U.S. Patent 
5,079,213 describes specific 4-cyano-pyrazol-5-yl-azoaniline 
dyes for use in thermal dye transfer imaging. 
While the dyes of these references can have good hue, 
solubility and transfer efficiency, they suffer from poor 
light stability. It is an object of this invention to 
provide pyrazolylazoaniline dyes
