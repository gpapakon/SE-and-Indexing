<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising a poly-emitter transistor (1) and a capacitor (2). A base electrode (14), a first electrode (16, 37) and an emitter window (18) are formed at the same time in a first polysilicon layer (13) covered with an insulating layer (25). Subsequently, the side walls of the electrodes (20, 39) and the wall (23) of the emitter window are covered at the same time with insulating spacers (22, 44) by depositing a layer of an insulating material, followed by an anisotropic etching process. The base (8) of the transistor is formed by ion implantation. The emitter (9) is formed by diffusion, from an emitter electrode (30) formed in a second polysilicon layer. Preferably, the first electrode of the capacitor consists of mutually connected strips (37).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising a bipolar transistor and a capacitor, wherein
-- a first layer of polycrystalline silicon is deposited on a surface of a semiconductor body, in which first layer of polycrystalline silicon there is formed a first pattern of conductors with a base electrode and a first capacitor electrode, and in which also an emitter window is etched, which is situated within the base electrode, wherein-- a layer of an insulating material is applied to the upper side and the side faces of the conductors and to the wall of the window, whereafter, in succession,-- the base region of the transistor in the semiconductor body is formed from an edge of the base electrode adjoining the emitter window, by implantation of ions through the emitter window and by diffusion of a dopant,-- a second layer of polycrystalline silicon is deposited wherein a second pattern of conductors is formed with an emitter electrode and a second capacitor electrode, and-- the emitter region of the transistor in the base region is formed from the emitter electrode by diffusion of a dopant.Such a method enables a semiconductor device comprising a single transistor and a single capacitor to be manufactured as well as an integrated circuit comprising a plurality of these elements. The transistors have a base region and an emitter region which are formed by the emitter window formed in the base electrode. Such transistors, also referred to as polyemitter transistors, can be embodied so as to be very small, and can particularly suitably be used to process signals of very high frequency, such as mobile telephony signals. Since the capacitors are also formed on the surface of the semiconductor body, conductor tracks connecting capacitors to one another and to transistors are very short. By virtue thereof, the method can very suitably be used to manufacture integrated circuits for processing said high-frequency signals.US-PS-5,336,632 describes a method of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph, wherein, after deposition of the first layer of polycrystalline silicon, the first pattern of conductors with the base electrode and the first capacitor electrode is formed first in this layer using a first anisotropic etching process. Subsequently, a first, composite layer of an insulating material is deposited on this pattern of conductors, said composite layer consisting of a bottom layer of silicon nitride, an intermediate layer of silicon oxide and a top layer of silicon
