<ABSTRACT>
A system of assembling wheels is disclosed, which 
comprises a steering angle correcting and phase matching 

unit for correcting the steering angle and also matching the 
phase of a hub of a car body suspended by a hanger being 

conveyed while being moved in synchronism with the car body 
and a wheel setting and hub nut tightening unit for setting 

a wheel on the phase-matched hub and tightening a nut 
thereon while being moved in synchronism with the car body. 

The horizontal distance between the steering angle 
correcting and phase matching unit and the wheel setting and 

hub nut tightening unit, is set to a distance such that when 
the wheel setting and hub nut tightening unit assembles a 

wheel onto the hub, the steering angle correcting and phase 
matching unit can correct steering angle and match the phase 

of the hub on which the next wheel is to be set.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for assembling 
wheels onto a car body conveyed in a state suspended by a 
hanger continuously (i.e., without being stopped). Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2-169303 
discloses a system of assembling wheels onto a car body 
conveyed in a state suspended by a hanger. FIG. 21 
schematically shows this system. As shown, the system 
mainly comprises a steering angle adjusting robot 212 and a 
wheel mounting robot 213 for adjusting the phase of a hub, 
setting a wheel on the phase-adjusted hub and then 
tightening hub nuts thereon. The steering angle adjusting robot 212 can self- run 
between a front wheel mounting position 215 of a stationary 
car body 211 and a retracted position 214. The wheel 
mounting robot 213 can self-run to a front and a rear wheel 
mounting position 215 and 216 of the stationary car body 211 
and to a wheel receiving position 217. This wheel assembling system assembles wheels onto the 
car body 211 by executing a series of routine steps shown in 
FIG. 21. 
(1) First, the hanger suspending the car body 211 is  
 
stopped to hold the car body 211 stationary. (2) Then, the wheel mounting robot 213 receives a wheel 
for the rear wheel. At this time, the robot receives the 
wheel with the phase (hub bolt insertion hole angle) thereof 
preliminarily adjusted. (3) Then, the robot 213 is moved to the rear wheel 
mounting position 216. (4) Then, the robot 213 adjusts the phase (i.e., hub 
bolt position angle) of the rear wheel hub. (5) Then, the robot 213 sets the wheel onto the rear 
wheel hub, that is, inserts each hub bolt into each hub bolt 
insertion hole. At this time, the wheel is set onto the hub 
by moving the wheel toward the hub since the phases of the 
wheel and hub have been adjusted in the steps (2) and (4) 
noted above. (6) Then, the robot 213 tightens each hub nut on each 
hub bolt, thus bringing an end to the assembling of the rear 
wheel. (7) Then, the robot 213 is returned to the wheel 
receiving position 217. (8) Then, the robot 213 receives a wheel for the front 
wheel. Again at this time, the robot 213 receives the wheel 
with the phase thereof preliminarily adjusted. (9) Then, the robot 213 is moved to the front wheel 
mounting position 215.  
 
During the steps (2) to (8), the steering angle 
adjusting robot 212 executes the following routine steps. 
[1] The robot 212 is moved from the retracted position 
214 to the front wheel mounting position 215. [2] Then, the robot 212 orients the front wheel hub in 
a predetermined
