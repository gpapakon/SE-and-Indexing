<ABSTRACT>
This circuit contains at least one alarm indication circuit (R1 to R12; OP) for detecting direct-current signals, which is additionally used for detecting contacts by the wires of the subscriber line with the power line in that it is preceded by bypass components (D1 to D4) which limit power line voltages to such an extent that the alarm indication circuit will not be overdriven, and in that it is followed by a time assessment circuit (TA) for distinguishing between power line voltage and direct-current signals.

<CLAIMS>
Exchange termination for the connection of a subscriber
access line to a digital time-division multiplex

telephone exchange, which has at least one indication
circuit which can be connected individually or as a

component of a group to the conductors of the
subscriber access line, or can be inserted into these

conductors, for identification of DC signalling
characters which are transmitted on the subscriber

access line to the exchange,
characterized

in that
 at least one of the indication circuits (E) can
in this way be used to identify network contacts

between the conductors (a, b) of the subscriber access
line, in that their input is preceded by bypass

switching elements, which lead to a circuit point
connected to earth potential, in the form of pairs of

zener diodes (D1 to D4), each of whose cathodes are
connected to one another, and whose threshold values

are set such that, firstly, the indication circuit is
not overdriven by network voltages which reach their

input terminals while, secondly, the identification of
DC signalling characters is not adversely affected,
in that
 the output signals which are emitted in the
event of the indication circuit responding are

subjected to time assessment (TA) in order to
distinguish between network voltages and DC signalling

characters,
 
and 
in that
, if a network voltage is found, at least
one indication circuit is disconnected from the

conductors of the subscriber access line.
