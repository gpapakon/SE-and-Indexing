<ABSTRACT>
A winding tool (14) is provided on a manipulator (18) of a type used to 
route the optical fiber. A hook (22) extends from the winding tool to capture optical 

fiber (10) extending from a device (11), and the hook is retracted to secure the fiber. 
A routing wheel (17) is positioned between the device (11) to which the optical fiber 

is connected and the reel such that the wheel can press the optical fiber (10) against 
an adhesive-coated substrate. The winding tool then winds the optical fiber around a 

reel (16). The optical fiber next feeds from the reel (16) to the routing wheel (17) as 
the manipulator (18) is moved to route the optical fiber on the coated substrate. 

Preferably, prior to the winding and wheel positioning step, the optical fiber between 
the reel and the routing wheel is engaged with an alignment tool (27). The fiber is 

secured in the alignment tool during the winding step, and the alignment tool insures 
engagement of the periphery of the routing wheel with the optical fiber after the 

winding step.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for routing optical fiber
and, more particularly, for routing optical fiber that is connected to a device.The U.S. patent of Burack et al., No. 5,259,051, granted
November 2, 1993, describes a unique
method for routing optical fibers on an optical backplane as is desirable, for example,
for interconnecting printed wiring boards of an electronic system. The Burack et al.
apparatus uses a robotic manipulator having a vertical axis that can be controlled to
move in X and Y directions and in the Óúç direction around its vertical axis. A
rotatable routing wheel is mounted on a free end of the manipulator, and a reel
containing optical fiber to be routed is mounted on one side of the manipulator. The
fiber is threaded over a peripheral portion of the routing wheel such that the wheel
can press the fiber against an adhesive-coated surface of a substrate to cause it to
adhere to the coated surface. The manipulator is then moved at an appropriate speed
and direction to cause the wheel to rotate and to exert sufficient tension on the
optical fiber to cause it to unwind from the reel and to be fed to the routing wheel for
adherence to the coated surface, thereby to form a continuous optical fiber portion
extending along, and adhered to, the coated surface.In the production of photonic or optical devices of a type to be used in
conjunction with an optical backplane, it is customary to package the devices such
that optical fibers (known in the art as "pigtails") extend from the devices. One
could form the optical backplane with different optical fiber and then splice the
optical backplane fiber to the fiber extending from the device; but it would be
preferable if one could route the fiber extending from the device directly onto the
optical backplane. There is therefore a need for a technique to improve the
placement and routing of optical fibers extending from, and connected to, devices. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus as defined
in claim 1, or a method as defined in claim 6.In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, a winding tool is provided
on a manipulator of a type described in the Burack et al. Patent. A hook extends from
the winding tool to capture optical fiber extending from the device, and the hook is
retracted to secure the fiber. The routing wheel is positioned between the 
device to which the optical fiber is connected and the winding tool such that the
routing wheel can press the optical fiber against an adhesive-coated

Apparatus for routing an optical fiber extending from a device
comprising:


a manipulator which can move in the lateral and vertical direction and which
comprises a winding tool (14), a movable hook (22), a rotatable reel (16) and a rotatable routing wheel (17);
means for extending and for retracting said hook (22) from said winding tool to capture part

of the optical fiber extending from the device;
means comprising said winding tool for driving said hook on a circular
path around said reel, thereby to wind the optical fiber on the reel;
said routing wheel comprising means for pressing part of the optical fiber
(10) against a flat surface of a substrate coated with adhesive; and
means for moving the manipulator in a direction parallel to said flat
surface at an appropriate speed and direction to cause the routing wheel to rotate and to

exert sufficient tension on the optical fiber to cause it to unreel from the reel for
adherence to the coated substrate.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein:

said manipulator further comprises means for extending an alignment
tool (27) to capture the optical fiber (10) between the winding tool and the device and to

hold it in a predetermined location such that it can be engaged by the routing wheel.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein:

said routing wheel has a first groove around its periphery to hold the
optical fiber in place;
and the alignment tool has a second groove (28) for holding the optical
fiber in alignment with said first groove.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein: 

said second groove has a latch (33) for capturing the optical fiber; and
the manipulator comprises means for raising the alignment tool with the optical fiber

captured in the second groove, and for pressing the routing wheel against the optical
fiber.
The apparatus of claim 4, further comprising a computer program for
controlling the movements of the manipulator including the winding tool and the hook.
A method of routing an optical fiber extending from a device using an
apparatus as defined in claim 1, comprising the steps of using the hook (22) to capture
