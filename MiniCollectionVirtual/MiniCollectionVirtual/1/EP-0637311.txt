<ABSTRACT>
Glycoside products having a propensity to discolor and/or to exhibit haze under aqueous alkaline or neutral pH conditions can be stabilized to substantially reduce the extent of discoloration and to essentially eliminate any haze which might also be present by adjusting the pH of a hydrogen peroxide-free aqueous solution of the alkyl glycoside product to about 7 prior to treatment with a metal borohydride material which at the end of the reaction period is consumed resulting in a stabilized alkyl polyglycoside product which does not exhibit a haze in an aqueous solution at a pH of about 7.

 METHOD FOR PREPARING STABILIZED ALKYL GLYCOSIDESCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a continuation-in-part of application serial number 07/873,908, filed on April 24, 1992.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to an improved method for preparing stabilized alkyl glycosides by treatment with a metal borohydride after a peroxide bleaching step. 2. Description of the Related Art Alkyl glycosides are conveniently prepared by reacting an alcohol of the type and chain length which is desired to form the "alkyl" portion of the glycoside of interest with a saccharide reactant (e.g., a monosaccharide such as glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, fructose, etc., or a polysaccharide such as starch, hemicellulose, lactose, maltose, melibiose, etc.) or with a glycoside starting material wherein the aglycone portion thereof is different from the alkyl substituent desired for the ultimate alkyl glycoside product of interest. Typically, such reaction is conducted at an elevated temperature and in the presence of an acid catalyst. Various alkyl glycoside products and processes for making same are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,235,783 (White, issued Mar. 18, 1941); U.S. Pat. No.
