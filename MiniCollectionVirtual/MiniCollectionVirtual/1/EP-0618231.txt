<ABSTRACT>
Conjugates of the general formula  A-L1-L2-B in which A and B represent substances to be coupled, selected from the groups of haptenes, proteins, polysaccharides, soluble polystyrenes or peptides, L1 and L2 represent trivalent linkers, and L1 and L2 are connected together via two thioethers, can be used in immunological assays and show improved storage stability.

Conjugates of the general formula

A-L
1
-L
2
-B

in which A and B are substances to be coupled,
selected from the group comprising haptens,

proteins, peptides, polysaccharides and other
polymers,


L
1
 is a homobidental trifunctional linker which
contains two maleimido groups and a

hydroxysuccinimide or carbodiimidazolyl group,
L
2
 is a homobidental trifunctional linker which
contains two thiol functional groups and a

hydroxysuccinimide or carbodiimidazolyl group,

wherein the substance A to be coupled is bound to
L
1
 via the hydroxysuccinimide or carbodiimidazolyl
group and the substance B to be coupled is bound to

L
2
 via the hydroxysuccinimide or carbodiimidazolyl
group, and the linkers L
1
 and L
2
 are linked
together by thioether bonds via the two maleimido

functional groups of L
1
 and the two thiol
functional groups of L
2
.
Conjugates as claimed in claim 1, wherein A and B
are selected from the group comprising antibodies,

antibody fragments, enzymes, haptens, biotin,
streptavidin and peroxidase.
Use of conjugates as claimed in claims 1 and 2 in
an immunological test. 
Process for preparing conjugates as claimed in
claims 1 and 2, wherein in a first step, a first

substance A to be coupled is coupled to a
homobidental, trifunctional linker L
1
 containing
two maleinimido groups and in a second step, a

second substance B to be coupled is coupled to a
homobidental, trifunctional linker L
2
 containing
two thiol groups and the two thus activated

substances AL
1
 and BL
2
 are linked to each other via
two thioether bonds by an SH group addition to

maleinimide.
Process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
substances to be coupled are each coupled to the

homobidental, trifunctional linkers L
1
 and L
2
 via a
hydroxysuccinimide or carbodiimidazolyl group.
Process as claimed in claims 4 or 5, wherein the
substances to be coupled are selected from the

group comprising antibodies, antibody fragment,
enzyme and hapten.
Process as claimed in claims 4 - 6, wherein the
substances to be coupled are selected from the

group comprising: biotin, streptavidin and
peroxidase.
