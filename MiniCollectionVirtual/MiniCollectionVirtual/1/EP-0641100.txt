<ABSTRACT>
In a block-spreading code-division multiple-access 
communication system a demodulator stores received chip data 

in a separate memory area for each transmitting station. 
Each area has a capacity of at least two blocks. When a 

complete block is received from a transmitting station, all 
blocks of data stored in the corresponding memory area are 

correlated against a set of product codewords, which are 
obtained by spreading a set of orthogonal codewords by the 

transmitting station's spreading code, to find the codeword 
that gives the maximum correlation value. For the oldest 

block, this correlation value and information identifying 
the codeword are output. For all blocks, the maximum 

correlation value and corresponding product codeword are 
used to calculate interference correction data, which are 

subtracted from the data in other memory areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a demodulator for a code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) communication system of the
block-spreading type.CDMA is a spread-spectrum system employed in personal
communication systems and other mobile communication
systems, in which multiple stations transmit simultaneously
over the same frequency band. In a block-spreading CDMA
system, data to be transmitted are divided for modulation
into P-bit blocks. Each block is converted to a Q-chip
codeword, which is then further modulated by a spreading
code to generate a baseband transmit signal. (P and Q are
positive integers.) The Q-chip codewords are mutually
orthogonal and are the same at all transmitting stations,
but each station uses a different spreading code. A
receiver demodulates the data transmitted from a particular
station by, for example, multiplying the incoming baseband
signal by that station's spreading code, correlating each
resulting block with all possible codewords, and selecting
the codeword that gives the highest correlation.It is known that the channel capacity of such a system
can be improved if the receiver takes steps to cancel 
interference between different transmitting stations. One
interference-canceling system disclosed in European Patent Application EP 0 526 439 relies on the fact that
signals from different transmitting stations usually arrive
with different strengths. The receiver first demodulates
the strongest signal, then cancels it out as interference
and demodulates the strongest remaining signal, continuing
in this way until all signals have been demodulated.
Unfortunately, this system does not work well when several
signals arrive with substantially the same strength.Another possible system demodulates the signals from
all transmitting stations in parallel, subtracting the
estimated interference generated by each station from the
signals of all the other stations. The process can be
iterated to obtain increasingly accurate estimates of the
transmitted signals and their interference. This system
appears to work well in theory, but when its actual behavior
is simulated it performs poorly, because it fails to take
maximum advantage of the available interference information.
The initial estimates of interference from a given station,
for example, are always derived from a signal from which
interference has not yet been removed.As further prior art, reference is made to EP 0 493 904 and to GLOBECOM'91,
vol. 2/3, Dec. 1991, NY, USA, page 1017-1021.It is accordingly an object of the present invention
