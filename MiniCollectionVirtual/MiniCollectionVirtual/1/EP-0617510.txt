<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface 
acoustic wave (SAW) element such as a SAW convolver 
used in spread spectrum communication, a method for 
designing it, and a signal receiver and a communication 
system using it. The SAW element, particularly a SAW convolver 
for extracting a convolution signal of two SAW signals, 
has been increasingly important in recent years and 
studied actively as a key device in making the spread 
spectrum communication. Fig. 1 is a schematic drawing to show an 
example of a conventional SAW element of this type. In 
Fig. 1, reference numeral 91 designates a piezoelectric 
substrate made for example of Y-cut (Z-propagating) 
lithium niobate, 92, 93 input interdigital transducer 
(referred to as IDT) as input transducers formed on the 
surface of the piezoelectric substrate 91, and 94 an 
output electrode formed on the surface of the 
piezoelectric substrate 91. These electrodes are made  
 
of a conductive material such as aluminum and usually 
formed utilizing the photolithography technology. When an electric signal with carrier angular 
frequency ω is input into the input IDT 92 in the SAW 
element as so arranged, the piezoelectric effect of the 
substrate oscillates a surface acoustic wave. 
Similarly, when an electric signal with carrier angular 
frequency ω is input into the input IDT 93, the 
piezoelectric effect of the substrate oscillates a 
surface acoustic wave. These two surface acoustic 
waves propagate in mutually opposite directions on the 
piezoelectric substrate 91 between the two input 
electrodes 92 and 93, and a convolution signal (carrier 
angular frequency 2ω), which is a correlation output of 
the two input signals, can be taken out from the output 
electrode 94 by the physical nonlinear effect of the 
piezoelectric substrate. Suppose the x axis is taken along the direction 
connecting between the two input IDT 92 and 93, the 
origin is at the middle between the two input IDT 92 
and 93, and the two surface acoustic waves are 
expressed as 
F(t-x/v)exp{j(ωt-kx)}  
 and 
G(t+x/v)exp{j(ωt+kx)}  
. Then, the nonlinear interaction 
produces a surface acoustic wave of their product of 
F(t-x/v)·G(t+x/v)exp(2jωt)  
 independent of the position, 
on the piezoelectric substrate 91. Providing a uniform 
output electrode 94, this signal can be integrated  
 
within a region of length of the electrode. Letting T 
be a length of interaction region, an output single can 
be expressed as follows. 
   Here, the integration range can be considered 
substantially
