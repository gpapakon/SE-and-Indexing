<ABSTRACT>
Process for the production of blow-moulded articles of thermoplastic material from parisons (V, V1) intermittently extruded by a melt accumulator (K), in which process at least one accumulator chamber (P), having a die (28) to be opened at regular intervals is filled with a stream of material from an extruder (E, E1) and a ram (38) arranged in the accumulator chamber (P) extrudes a predetermined amount of material through the die, the stream of material emerging from the extruder (E, E1) is supplied at an extruder delivery rate adequate for a constant volumetric filling delivery rate to the accumulator head and is fed to the accumulator head (K) permanently and at a constant volumetric filling delivery rate and, during its pushing-out stroke, is delivered against an accumulation (build-up). The apparatus suitable for carrying out the process has between the accumulator head (K) and each extruder (E) a strictly volumetrically delivering melt pump (S), which is driven permanently at a constant rotational speed and serves as the filling unit for the accumulator chamber (P).

Process for the production of blow-moulded 
articles of thermoplastic material from preforms (V,V') 

intermittently extruded from a single-die or a co-extrusion 
accumulator head, in which process at least one 

accumulator chamber (P) in the accumulator head (K), 
having a moulding die (28) to be opened intermittently, 

is filled from an extruder (E,E') with a stream of 
material and a ram (38) arranged in the accumulator 

chamber (P) extrudes a predetermined amount of preform 
material through the moulding die (28) with every expulsion 

stroke, characterized in that the stream of material 
emerging from the extruder (E,E') is provided at a extruder 

delivery rate adequate for a constant volumetric 
filling delivery rate to the accumulator head (K) and, on 

this basis, is fed to the accumulator head (K) 
permanently and at a constant volumetric filling delivery 

rate and is delivered during each expulsion stroke 
against a back pressure. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the stream of material emerging from the extruder 

(E,E') is delivered to the accumulator head (K) by means 
of a melt pump (S) which is arranged upstream of the 

accumulator head (K), is permanently driven at constant 
rotational speed and delivers strictly volumetrically. 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the input pressure of the melt pump (S) is 

kept approximately at a pressure value ensuring the 
constant volumetric filling delivery rate, and in that 

the delivery performance, for example the rotational  
 

drive speed, of the extruder (E,E') is varied with the 
pressure value as a reference variable in such a way 

that, when the input pressure falls or rises in relation 
to this pressure value, the delivery performance of the 

extruder (E,E') is increased or reduced, preferably 
within a closed control loop. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that 
the ram (38) is pushed back in the 
accumulator chamber (P) after each expulsion stroke by 

means of the delivery pressure of the melt pump. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the delivery pressure of the 

melt pump (S) is monitored in comparison with a cut-out 
pressure value, which is set higher than the dynamic 

pressure on the delivery side during the expulsion stroke 
of the ram (38). 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the accumulator-chamber filling 

rate is set, and in that the expulsion stroke of the ram 
(38) and the opening of the moulding die (28) are initiated 

upon reaching a ram stroke position dependent on the 
filling rate. 
Apparatus for blow-moulding articles from 
thermoplastic preforms (V,V') having at least one extruder 

(E,E') and having at least one single-die or coextrusion 
accumulator head (K) which is arranged downstream 

of the extruder and has at least one accumulator 
chamber (P), a ram (38) which can be driven therein to 

perform in each case an expulsion stroke and a moulding 
die (28) opening intermittently for the extruding of the 

preforms, characterized in that between the accumulator 
head (K) and each extruder (E) there is provided as a 

filling unit for the accumulator chamber (P) a melt pump 
(S) which is driven permanently at constant rotational 

speed and delivers strictly volumetrically. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the melt pump (S) is a gear pump with its own drive 

and gear mechanism (16), which is fitted removably as a 
module into a connection (9, 26) leading from the  

 
extruder (E) to the accumulator head (K). 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that, on the input side (13) of the melt pump (S), a 

pressure sensor (20) is provided for the input pressure 
and is connected to a control device (10) for the extruder 

drive (7) in such a way that the drive speed of the 
extruder (E) is variable for maintaining a predetermined 

input pressure value. 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that, on the output side (14) of the melt pump (S), a 

pressure sensor (21) is provided for the delivery pressure 
of the melt pump (S) and is linked to a delivery-pressure-dependent 

cut-out device (19) of the melt-pump 
drive (16). 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that a control device (C) is provided for the accumulator 

head (K), to which device a ram-stroke sensor (29), a ram 
drive (31) and a drive (33) for opening and closing the 

moulding die (28) and for varying the moulding-die 
orifice width are connected.
