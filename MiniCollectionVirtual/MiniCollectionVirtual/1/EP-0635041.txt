<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain polyoxymethylene compositions 
containing an encapsulated nucleant which, when extruded into stock 
shapes, such as rod, slab, sheet, and tube, have improved center line porosity 
values in comparison to comparable compositions that lack the encapsulated 
nucleant and that are extruded at the same rate. Compositions based on polyoxymethylenes of relatively high 
number average molecular weight (i.e., 10,000 to 100,000) are useful in 
preparing semi-finished and finished articles by stock shape extrusion, 
compression molding, injection molding, blow molding, rotational molding, 
melt spinning, stamping and thermoforming techniques commonly used with 
thermoplastic materials. Finished articles made from such compositions 
possess desirable physical properties, including high stiffness, strength, low 
coefficient of friction, and good wear and solvent resistance. However, in 
certain applications, especially stock shape extrusion, it is desirable to 
reduce the center line porosity of the polyoxymethylene composition. By the 
present invention, the center line porosity of polyoxymethylene compositions 
is found to be lowered, in comparison to comparable compositions, extruded 
at the same rate by the inclusion of therein of low levels of particular types 
of encapsulated nucleants. The compositions of the present invention are especially useful in 
those applications where a polyoxymethylene composition is extruded into a 
stock shape and where it is desired that such stock shapes have reduced 
center line porosity, without slowing the rate of extrusion. Stock shapes 
include rods, slabs, sheets, tubes, and other symmetrical shapes. Rod and 
slab stock shapes are used as blanks in machining processes. Sheets are 
used for die cut parts (such as gears, washers, and gaskets). Tubes are used 
for control cable inners (which are small diameter tubes that serve as 
conduits for push/pull cables).  
 It was found in the present invention that the presence of an 
encapsulated nucleant in polyoxymethylene reduces the center line porosity 
of stock shaped extruded parts of polyoxymethylene compositions. In the extrusion of polyoxymethylene compositions into stock 
shapes, such as rod, slab, sheet, and tube stocks, it is found that "voids" or 
"porosity" can occur in the center of the stock shape. In the present 
application, and as is generally known in the art, the terms "voids" and 
"porosity" are used interchangeably. These "voids" can be measured and a 
"center line porosity
