<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an exhaust system for a W-12 reciprocating piston internal combustion engine (20) with three cylinder banks (22, 24, 26) each of four cylinders (1 to 12), the exhaust ports of which are connected to exhaust pipes, two separate exhaust lines (28, 30), to which two cylinders per cylinder bank (22, 24, 26) are connected, being provided in order to obtain a functional structurally favourable system.

<CLAIMS>
Exhaust system for a W-12 reciprocating-type internal 
combustion engine having three cylinder rows each 

with four cylinders, the exhaust ports of which are 
connected to two separate exhaust channels, in each 

of which is arranged a lambda sensor which is used 
for closed-loop control of an engine management 

system for controlling the fuel/air mixture, 
characterised in that two cylinders are connected to 

the separate exhaust channels (28, 30) for each 
cylinder row (22, 24, 26), and these cylinders are 

assigned to a duplex engine management system 
provided for a respective six cylinders. 
Exhaust system according to claim 1, characterised in 
that yoke-shaped elbow sections (44, 64) are arranged 

on an end face (76) of the internal combustion engine 
(2), and opening out into these elbow sections is the 

exhaust pipe for the combined cylinders and running 
from them is at least one respective front exhaust 

pipe section (48, 66). 
Exhaust system according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the two yoke-shaped elbow 

sections (44, 64) are united to form a dual-flow 
exhaust-gas elbow (46). 
Exhaust system according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that in the case of a 1-8-9-3-6-11-4-5-12-2-7-10 

firing order for the internal 
combustion engine, cylinders 1-4, 6-7 and 9-12 are 

joined to one elbow section (44) and the remaining 
cylinders to the other elbow section (64). 
Exhaust system according to one or more of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the exhaust pipes (36, 38  

 
and 56, 58, respectively) of the central cylinder row 

(24) are arranged inside the space (70) covered by an 
intake pipe section (72) and delimited by an outer 

cylinder row (22). 
Exhaust system according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the exhaust 

pipes (32, 34, 52, 54 and 40, 42, 60, 62) running 
from the exhaust ports of the outer cylinder rows 

(22, 26) extend beneath the corresponding cylinder 
heads, with the central cylinder row (24) arranged 

upright and the cylinder rows offset by 60Â°. 
Exhaust system according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that at least the 

exhaust pipes and the yoke-shaped exhaust-gas elbow 
(46) are thermally insulated.
