<ABSTRACT>
The contact spring (3) is used between relatively movable parts (1,2) of a HF appts. housing made of bare sheet metal, for providing an electrical contact path between them. The housing parts are made of chrome steel and the contact spring is made of nickel silver. Pref. the contact surfaces of the housing parts engaged by the contact spring are polished or coated with HF oil. The contact spring may be used between the housing chassis and the opening access door for an appts housing.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for making contact between housing
parts (1, 2) of an electrical device, in particular for

the electromagnetic sealing of a device having lines
carrying high frequencies, the housing parts comprising

shiny metal sheet, and contact springs (3) being arranged
between housing parts (1, 2) that can move relative to

one another, the said springs (3) being clamped between
the two housing parts (1, 2) and connecting the latter

electrically, characterized in that the housing parts (1,
2) consist of stainless steel and the contact springs of

nickel silver.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the contact surfaces of the housing part (1) on

which the contact springs are placed are ground.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the contact surfaces are coated with highfrequency

grease.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized
in that the housing parts (1, 2) form a housing

of a switch cabinet of a telecommunications system.
