<ABSTRACT>
In a fountain pen, having a reservoir space (2) that can be filled with ink and is connected via a connecting duct (8) to a flow regulator (7) and a writing tip (6), and having a reserve space (3), which can be connected to the reservoir space (2) by opening a refill valve (4), which is closed in its position of rest, for the purposes of refilling, the reserve space (3) has a refill aperture which is accessible from outside and closed by an automatically closing valve, to which aperture a refill container, provided with means for holding the valve open, can be sealingly connected. The connecting duct (8) can be locked by a separating valve (9) which is open in its position of rest, and the refill valve (4) is connected to the separating valve (9) by an actuating element (12) in such a way that the separating valve (9) is closed before the refill valve (4) opens and is opened after the refill valve (4) has closed.

<CLAIMS>
A writing instrument, in particular a fountain
pen, with a feed reservoir (2) which is adapted to be

filled with ink or another writing fluid, communicates
through a communication channel (8) with a flow equalizer

(7) and a writing tip (6) and is adapted to be refilled
from a supply reservoir (3) connectible with the feed

reservoir (2) by a refill valve (4) being opened which in
its home position is closed, said communication channel

(8) being adapted to be closed by a shutoff valve (9)
which is open in its home position and is connected with

the refill valve (4) by an actuating member (12),

characterized in that
 the supply reservoir (3) has an
externally accessible refill opening (22, 34) closed by

an automatically closing valve (33), to which opening a
refill container provided with means for keeping the

valve (33) open is attachable tightly, and that the
shutoff valve (9) is closed before the refill valve (4)

opens and is opened after the refill valve (4) is closed.
The writing instrument as claimed in the
preceding claim, 
characterized in that
 means are provided
effecting an increase in the volume of the feed reservoir

(2) following closing of the refill valve (4) and prior
to opening of the shutoff valve (9).
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the closure
element (14) of the refill valve (4) is configured as a

piston which is axially movable in the closed position of
the refill valve (4). 
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the closure
elements (10, 14, 38) of the refill valve (4) and of the

shutoff valve (9) are secured to a common plunger (13),
and that the actuating travel of the plunger (13) for

closing the shutoff valve (9) is dimensioned smaller than
the actuating travel for opening the refill valve (4).
The writing instrument as claimed in claim 4,

characterized in that
 the closure element (10) of the
shutoff valve (9) and/or the closure element (38) of the

refill valve (4) is axially movable relative to the
plunger (13).
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the closure
element (10) of the shutoff valve (9) is made of an

elastically deformable hose which is fastened to the
closure element (14) of the refill valve (4) and has a

free end adapted to be urged into engagement with a valve
seat (11) at the entrance end of the communication

channel (8).
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the refill
valve (4) and/or the shutoff valve (9) includes a valve

seat with a seating surface (17) formed by a cylindrical
bore into which the closure element (14) is insertable

and in which the closure element (14) is axially movable
within limits.
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 ribs (35, 36) 
extending in the direction of flow are arranged adjacent

to the valve seat (11, 17, 40) of the refill valve (4)
and/or of the shutoff valve (9).
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
, for
actuation, the refill valve (4) and the shutoff valve (9)

are connected by means of a plunger (13) with a push-button
(20) closing the end of the supply reservoir (3)

opposite the writing tip (6).
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the push-button
(20) takes support upon a compression spring (25)

holding said push-button in a home position in which the
refill valve (4) is closed and the shutoff valve (9) is

opened.
The writing instrument as claimed in claim 9,

characterized in that
 the push-button (20) has an
external thread screwed down into the tapped bore of a

sleeve-shaped rotary knob (47) and is axially movable by
turning the rotary knob (47).
The writing instrument as claimed in claim 11,

characterized in that
 the rotary knob (47) has an
abutment surface (50) suitable for engagement by the

guide element (84) of a refill container (61) in an axial
direction, and that the position of the abutment surface

(50) and the length of the guide element (84) are
relatively coordinated such that the refill container

(61) is only connectible with the supply reservoir (3)

The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the effective

refill valve (4), which latter area separates the supply
reservoir (3) from the feed reservoir (2).
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the refill
opening is formed by a central bore (22) in the push-button

(20), said bore accommodating the automatically
closing valve (33).
The writing instrument as claimed in claim 14,

the outside diameter of the hollow needle of the refill
container only a small amount.
The writing instrument as claimed in any one of
the claims 14 to 16, 
characterized in that
 a guiding
surface (37) is provided which is arranged concentrically
