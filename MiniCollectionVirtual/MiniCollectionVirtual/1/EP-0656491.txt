<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a double acting type 
dynamic back spacing removed driving system which comprises 

a non-reversible transmission worm gear and worm set 
including two sets of worms coupling with a worm gear. 

When the system is driven, one prime worm continues 
applying rotary driving force, and whether or not the worm 

gear is driven, such force continues to engage the prime 
work permanently. A second prime worm is to control 

displacement and also couples with another worm gear (or is 
co-axially secured to the respective worm gear with the 

same or different pitch). Due to the different driven 
speeds of the two sets of worms when rotating in opposite 

directions, a tensive state is produced between the threads 
of the two sets of worms and the worm wheel and back-lash 

is eliminated. On rotation in one direction, one set of 
worms is driven faster and the other set is driven more 

slowly. When the direction is reversed, the respective 
speeds of the sets of worms are also reversed. The speed 

difference in either direction of rotation is taken up by 
one set of torsion limiting transmission devices so that 

back lash is eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kind of double-acting transmission for driving a
rotatably driven body in two opposed directions.Publication number EP 0508789 discloses a double-acting type transmission. A gear is
driven by two worms, one of which applies drive, and the other of which controls the
rotation of the gear. In this way, backlash is reduced. To do this, the displacement
control worm is driven more slowly than the drive worm, and a torsion limiting device
in a gear system between the two worms prevents the system from locking up.According to the present invention, the double-acting transmission for driving a
rotatably driven body in two opposed rotational directions and for removing backlash
during operation comprises a first prime mover, a second prime mover and the rotatably
driven body coupled with each of the first and second prime movers, the first prime
mover acting as a driving mover for driving the rotatably driven body in one direction,
and the second prime mover acting on the rotatably driven body as a first displacement
control body, and the second prime mover acts as a driving body for driving the
rotatably driven body in an opposite direction and the first prime mover acts on the
rotatably driven body as a second displacement control body acting in a direction
opposite to said first displacement control body, the prime movers being worm shafts
and the rotatably driven body being a worm gear,
a backlash removing driving system, including a torsion limiting coupling,
which restricts the displacement control body to rotate more slowly than the driving
body so that no backlash exists between the rotatably driven body and the prime
movers, which applies power to the first prime mover to drive the rotatably driven
body in the one direction, and to the second prime mover to drive the rotatably driven
body in the opposite direction, and which enables changes between the two directions 
without backlash by virtue of the rotatably driven body being acted on by both prime
movers anda power source for driving the prime movers in which the relationship
between the driving speed of the power source as it drives the prime mover is that said
driving speed greater than or equal to the speed of the rotatably driven body. Each of
the prime movers is connected to a respective prime mover inertia damping device for
damping the inertia of the prime mover when the transmission is being halted, each
damping device being located between a prime mover and the fixed casing of the
transmission, and having
