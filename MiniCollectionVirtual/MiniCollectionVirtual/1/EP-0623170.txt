<ABSTRACT>
A vaccine for use to treat or prevent a disease in a vertebrate, the vaccine comprising an antigenic entity and a carrier, the antigenic entity being adapted to cause, following vaccination of the vertebrate with the vaccine, an immune response providing antibodies which inhibit a factor from a pathogen which directly or indirectly causes breakdown of protein in the vertebrate wherein said breakdown enhances growth of the pathogen. A vaccine against the streptokinase of Streptococcus uberis can be used to prevent mastitis in cattle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vaccination against bovine mastitis.To cause clinical mastitis in the bovine udder a bacterium must
either grow within the gland at a rate sufficient to avoid removal in the
secretion or must colonise normal secretory and/or ductular tissues. More
virulent strains of bacteria may resist phagocytic killing despite the
presence of large numbers of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Certain
species of bacteria are known to produce haemolytic and/or cytolytic toxins
which may have a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.To date, vaccines to protect the mammary gland from clinical
mastitis have attempted to promote more efficient phagocytosis and
killing of bacteria (by the production of opsonising antibody) or to
inactivate toxic products (by the production of neutralising antibody).Streptococcus uberis is a common cause of bovine mastitis
responsible for around 20% of all clinical cases in the UK (Bramley and
Dodd 1984). The ability of this organism to infect the lactating mammary
gland is dependant on its ability to grow in the secretion and avoid
phagocytosis by bovine neutrophils (Leigh et al 1990).The majority of nitrogen in bovine milk is present in the form of
protein (Aston 1975) and, in the absence of proteolysis, bacterial growth in
milk is limited by the lack of free amino acids. This is highlighted by the
dependence of the lactic streptococci on extracellular, caseinolytic
proteinases for growth in milk (Mills and Thomas 1981). The ability of
bacteria to grow in mastitic milk is enhanced by the presence of the
caseinolytic enzyme plasmin (Marshall and Bramley 1984). The
transformation of plasminogen to plasmin requires plasminogen
activators which are known to occur in blood plasma and animal tissues
(Collen 1980). Certain streptococci are capable of producing streptokinase
which activates plasminogen to plasmin but no previously isolated
streptokinase activates bovine plasminogen. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
vaccine for use to treat or prevent bovine mastitis, comprising a bovine
plasminogen-activating protein produced by a bovine-infecting, mastitis-causing
strain of Streptococcus and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Suitable carriers and adjuvants etc for formulating the protein entity into a
vaccine are known.Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may, for example, be liquid media
suitable for use as vehicles to introduce a protein into an animal. An example of
such a carrier is saline solution. The protein may be in
