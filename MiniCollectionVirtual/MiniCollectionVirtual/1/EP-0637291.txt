<ABSTRACT>
An improved system for generating hydrogen fuel for use in an energy-producing device such as a fuel cell or heat engine is disclosed. The hydrogen is produced at a faster rate by reacting particles of an activated iron reactant with heated water in a fluidized bed-type reactor. The reaction results in an increased rate of hydrogen production along with spent metal oxide particles which are easily and cheaply regenerable.

<DESCRIPTION>
There is a real need for the efficient production of 
hydrogen for use as a fuel in both vehicular and stationary 
engines and fuel cell systems. While hydrogen is a clean and 
efficient fuel for such energy producing systems, it is both 
expensive to produce in a pure form and unsafe to store in 
quantity (because of its combustibility). Moreover, hydrogen 
is expensive and heavy when stored in containers of practical 
size. Fossil fuels or their derivatives, such as natural gas 
or methanol, are currently converted to hydrogen for use in 
a fuel cell by means of a complicated set of bulky components: 
a reformer (to convert the fossil fuel to a mixture of 
hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water vapor); 
a shift converter (to remove most but not all of the carbon 
monoxide); and one or more gas purifiers (needed if the 
hydrogen is to be used in a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell 
(PEM) or an alkaline fuel cell or stored as a metal hydride). 
The fuel cells that need no gas purifier, such as phosphoric 
acid fuel cells, are the heaviest and largest. A fuel cell 
that is relatively light-weight and compact, e.g. a PEM or 
alkaline fuel cell, generally needs complicated, delicate and 
expensive purifying apparatus to utilize hydrogen. For cost and availability reasons, if the fuel is natural 
gas, then storage on vehicles such as fork lift trucks, 
automobiles, etc. is heavy, bulky, and of somewhat marginal 
safety. Gaseous hydrogen storage in such an environment is 
also a problem. It is either too voluminous (at low pressure) 
or too heavy (because of the tank or cylinder needed at high 
pressure). Moreover, both storage systems are potentially 
unsafe because of the combustibility of the hydrogen.  
 Storage of hydrogen as a metal hydride is also expensive 
since metal alloys suitable for hydrogen storage in readily 
reversible metal hydrides are expensive to fabricate and 
because they require the hydrogen to be free of carbon 
monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. Regeneration of 
such metal hydrides is also a problem because it requires pure 
hydrogen, which is relatively more costly than reformed 
natural gas, which is relatively inexpensive and contains 
impurities such as carbon dioxide and steam. Adding to the 
regeneration expense is the continuous supply of external 
cooling that is needed to drive the regeneration reaction. 
Recently it has been suggested that hydrogen be stored as 
H2SO4 and reacted with scrap iron to produce hydrogen.
