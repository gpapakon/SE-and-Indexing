<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyimide-based resin 
composition, a process for preparing the resin composition and 
an injection molded article of the resin composition. More 
particularly, embodiments of the invention relate to a polyimide-based 
resin composition which is soluble and thermoplastic, 
especially to a composition comprising a thermoplastic polyimide 
having good solubility in general purpose organic solvents and a 
fibrous reinforcement such as carbon fiber, glass fiber, aromatic 
polyamide fiber and/or a potassium titanate fiber ; a process for 
preparing the polyimide-based resin composition ; and an injection 
molded article prepared from the polyimide-based resin composition. The present invention further relates to a polyimide-based 
composite, and more particularly relates to a polyimide-based laminated 
composite obtained by molding the above 
polyimide in combination with a fibrous reinforcement and a process for 
molding the same. The present invention still further relates to a fibrous 
reinforcement having a surface modified with the above polyimide. The fibrous reinforcement having a surface modified with the above 
polyimide which can be used for the invention has an improved 
applicability. That is, polyimide used for the invention can be 
applied as a surface modifier for the fibrous reinforcement particularly 
in the form of a solution.  Conventionally, polyimide has a high heat resistance, is excellent 
in mechanical strengths and dimensional stability, and additionally has 
flame retardance and electrical insulation property. Thus, polyimide 
has been widely used in the field of electric and electronic 
appliances, space and aeronautic equipment and transport machinery. 
Various kinds of polyimide which exhibit outstanding properties have 
been conventionally developed. However, some polyimide has no distinct 
glass transition temperature although heat resistance is excellent and 
must be processed with a specific means such as sinter molding in the 
case of using is a molding material. Other polyimide has low glass 
transition temperature although processing ability is excellent, or is 
inferior to common engineering plastics in resistance to absorption of 
water and moisture. Thus, conventional polyimide has both merits and 
drawbacks in terms of property. Particularly, low resistance to absorption of water and moisture is 
liable to cause problems in application to uses which require such 
resistance. For example, in the field of space and aeronautic 
equipment,
