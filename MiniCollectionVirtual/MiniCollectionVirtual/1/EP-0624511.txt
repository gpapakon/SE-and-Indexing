<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the articulation of a tilt cylinder (4) on the tiltable cab (1, 2, 3) of a lorry, via a transverse bolt (17) which is fixed on the driver's cab and passes through an elongated hole (8) in the bearing eye (7) provided at the end of the tilt-cylinder piston rod (6), the length of the elongated hole (8) being determined such that free inward and outward deflection of the driver's cab during driving mode is possible. To avoid the development of noise, there are provided in the bearing eye (7) of the piston rod (6) longitudinal grooves (11, 12), which run parallel to the elongated hole (8) but, in contrast, have a larger surface area (9, 10) and have conical edges (13, 14), into which grooves tapered rollers (22, 23), which are mounted rotatably on the transverse bolt (17) and are made of elastic material, are inserted with a certain amount of play, which rollers serve as connecting elements between the driver's cab and tilt-cylinder piston (6), which elements provide insulation against structure-borne noise, the rollers centring the bearing eye (7) of the piston in the transverse direction and rolling along the longitudinal grooves (11, 12) in the event of dynamic movements of the driver's cab.

Location device of a tilt cylinder on a tilting cab of a truck via a cross pin 
that is firmly attached to the cab and penetrates a slot in the mount eye 

located at the end of the piston rod of the tilt cylinder, which slot, in respect 
of its length, is designed so as to allow the cab unimpeded spring 

compression and rebound while the vehicle is in motion, characterised in 
that in the mount eye (7) of the piston rod (6) of the tilt cylinder 

longitudinal grooves (11, 12) are provided which run parallel to the slot (8) 
but have a larger base area (9, 10) than said slot (8) and have tapered edges 

(13, 14), into which reach, with a certain play, tapered rollers (22, 23) that 
are swivel-mounted on the cross pin (17), are made of elastic material, 

serve as structure-borne-noise-insulated connection elements between cab 
and tilt-cylinder piston (6), centre the mount eye (7) of said tilt-cylinder 

piston (6) and roll in the longitudinal grooves (11, 12) in the event of 
dynamic cab movement. 
Location device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the cross pin 
(17) is formed by the shank of a bolt (18) for tensioning a bearing sleeve 

(24) between the two side walls (19, 20) of two longitudinal members (2, 
3) firmly attached to the cab, which bearing sleeve (24) has a diameter 

somewhat smaller than the width of the slot (8) in the mount eye (7) of the 
piston rod and serves as a support organ for the tapered rollers (22, 23) that 

are swivel-mounted on said support organ and have with slight axial play 
between the side walls (19, 20) of the longitudinal members and the base 

areas (9, 10) of the longitudinal grooves. 
Location device according to one of the aforementioned Claims, 
characterised in that in respect of the slot (8) in the mount eye (7) of the 

piston rod, the length of the longitudinal grooves (11, 12) and the diameter 
of the metallic tapered roller-support organ (24) are such that a metal-to-metal 

contact can be prevented even in the event of the most vigorous 
dynamic cab movement while the vehicle is in motion. 
Location device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the tapered 
rollers (22, 23) are made of a material such as polyurethane or hard rubber 

that allows limited elastic deformation.
