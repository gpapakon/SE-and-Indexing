<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid adhesive 
for electronic parts to be used for adhering between parts 
around a leadframe making up a semiconductor device, e.g., 
lead pins, semiconductor chip-mounted substrates, heat 
spreaders, semiconductors themselves, and to a process for 
forming an insulating adhesive layer using the same. Conventionally, adhesive tapes for innerlead lock 
of leadframe, TAB tapes, etc., are used as adhesive tapes for 
use in the interior of resin-sealed type semiconductor 
devices. For example, the adhesive tapes for innerlead lock 
of leadframe have been used to fix lead pins of the leadframe 
in order to increase the yield of production and to enhance 
the efficiency for producing a leadframe itself and the 
whole semiconductor assembly stages, as shown in Fig. 1. 
In general, a leadframe manufacturer makes a leadframe, and 
brings to it a semiconductor manufacturer, at which a chip is 
mounted thereon followed by molding the leadframe with a 
resin. In Fig. 1, the symbol (a) shows a whole drawing, and 
(b) shows a partly enlarged view, in which numerical 1 is a 
position of innerlead lock, 2 is a dam bar, 3 is a lead 
pin, and 4 is an island portion. For this reason, it has 
been required for the adhesive tapes for innerlead lock of 
a leadframe not only to possess general reliability to a  
 
level required for semiconductor and enough processability 
at the time of taping, but also to possess sufficient 
adhesive strength immediately after taping and heat 
resistance enough for withstanding thermal process at the 
stages of assembling semiconductor devices. Conventionally, the adhesive tapes for use in 
such an application include adhesive tapes applied to a 
support film of e.g. polyimide film; an adhesive comprising 
a synthetic rubber resin such as polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylate 
or acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer solely, or modified with 
any other resin or blended with any other resin to come into 
a B-stage. In recent years, in the interior of the semiconductor 
device, the package structure has become complicated due to 
the increased number of pins and the need to secure the 
radiating ability and, thus, the organic materials used 
therein have needed to meet severe requirements in terms of electronic and 
physical properties as well as handling characteristics. The adhesive tapes hitherto used for electronic 
parts in which a base film necessarily required have had 
problems respective to the fixing of lead pins and other 
application. For example, in
