<ABSTRACT>
A connecting piece for hydraulic circuits comprises a 
substantially cylindrical longitudinally drilled body (10), 

having a central sector (12) provided with two sets of radial 
holes (14) and opposing end sectors (16), (18), on which two or 

more inclined plane protruding gears (22) are obtained. 
A set of holes (14) is circumscribed by a shoulder (24) and at 
least in the direction of one of them, the central sector (12) is 

sunk according to an inclined orientation to form a cone-shaped 
portion (28) obtained between the two sets of holes (14). 
Alternative embodiments provide a connecting piece (50) having 
one only set of radial holes (58) on a central sector (56) 

circumscribed on opposing fronts by a shoulder (60); besides, on 

a sector (54) one or more protruding gears (64) and a connection 
(10') having one or more radial holes (86) on the sector (72) 

which circumscribes a socket seat (76'), partly extended in 
longitudinal direction within said sector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connecting piece for hydraulic 
circuits, suitable for balancing the pressure of the fluid 
contained therein. More particularly, this invention relates to a device for 
balancing the pressure of the fluid, especially suitable to be 
utilized in the power steering system of vehicles. As is known, some motor vehicles are provided with an hydraulic 
servo-mechanism suitable to reduce the strain necessary to rotate 
the steering wheel during the running and the manoeuvre. Such 
mechanism comprises basically an hydraulic central assembly, 
installed on the vehicle, and a system of valves which, by 
opening when the strain exercised on the steering wheel exceeds a 
given value, take the pressurized fluid, causing it to act on the 
steering-gear lever to obtain an additional power orientated in 
the same direction as the steering direction. The aforementioned servo-mechanisms have often a drawback 
associated to the fluid pressure, which causes, especially during 
the standstill manoeuvres, a remarkable noisiness of the whole; 
the drawback is due, in particular, to the pressure impulses of 
the fluid, starting from the source of hydraulic pressure 
constituted by the compressor or pump, which are transmitted to 
the circuit along which said fluid flows to reach and activate 
the servo-mechanism. In order to obviate the aforementioned drawback, several 
solutions have been proposed to balance the pressure which 
creates within the circuit, providing flexible coaxial ducts 
within same, the innermost of which is provided with radially  
 
orientated openings; a metal injecting nozzle, placed at the 
mouth of the circuit, acts as a connection between said internal 
duct and the end of the metal tube connected to the pressure 
source. Said nozzle, provided with an axial drilling, is 
connected to the small metal tube by welding or it is pressure-inserted 
in same; in the latter solution, proposed by the 
international patent PCTCH 910028, the nozzle portion suitable to 
be inserted in the tube is hexagon-shaped, in order to create 
more axial through-ways for the fluid. It has been pointed out that in the hypothesis of a connection by 
welding of the aforementioned components, the scales or clots 
which form as a consequence of the operation may come off the 
body and enter the duct; in this case, the impurities, however 
of minor size, jeopardize the working of the servo-mechanism, 
reaching the steering wheel gear box where they jam or at least 
alter the working of the valves.
