<ABSTRACT>
A silicon substrate (1) carries an isolating silicon dioxide 
layer (2) and a relatively weakly and negatively (n) doped 

monocrystalline silicon wafer (3). A component region (4) is 
delimited in the wafer by an isolating layer (5). A bipolar 

transistor (BIP1) in the component region has a positively (p) 
doped base region (B) which includes a heavily and positively 

(p⁺) doped base connection (B1) and a heavily and negatively 
(n⁺) doped emitter (E1). The transistor (BIP1) has a PN-junction 

(9) at the underside of the base region (B) and is 
series-connected with a field effect transistor (JFET1) 

having a heavily and negatively (n⁺) doped drain connection 
(D1). The component region (4) is weakly doped and the 

distance from the PN-junction (9) to the silicon dioxide layer 
(2) is small so that a region (DP1) will be readily depleted 

of charge carriers when applying voltages (V
E
, V
B
, V
D
) to the 
transistors (BIP1, JFET1). The voltages produce an electric 

field (E
D
) of low electrical field strength in the depleted 
region (DP1). This counteract
s the breakthrough of a current 
(I) between the base (B) and the drain connection (D1). The 

transistors (BIP1, JFET1) withstand high voltages and require 
only half the space on the substrate (1) required by corresponding 

earlier known transistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device in a
thin active layer with high breakdown voltage, said device
having charge carrier depleted regions of reduced electrical
field strength and comprising
a semiconductor body;a component region of semiconductor material carried by the
semiconductor body and having an upper surface which region is
weakly doped with a first type (n) of doping material;a dielectric isolating layer which delimits a lower surface
of the component region from the semiconductor body;an electrically delimiting separation layer which extends
along the remaining surfaces of the component region that
border on the semiconductor body;a sunken region in the component region that has a relatively
low concentration of a second type (p) of doping material
which is opposite to the first type of doping material,
wherein the sunken region extends from the upper surface of
the component region;a PN-junction at the surface of the sunken region that
delimits said region from a remaining part of the component
region;at least one semiconductor component in the component
region; andat least two electrical connections in the component
region, wherein the regions of reduced electrical field
strength are depleted of charge carriers by electrical
voltages applied to the electrical connections and a first of
the charge carrier depleted regions extends from the PN-junction
to the dielectric isolating layer, at least beneath
a part of the sunken region.Semiconductor circuits are required to withstand a relatively
high voltage in many different kinds of applications. An
example of one such application is found in the subscriber
line circuits of telephone exchanges. In older Swedish
telephone exchanges, the line to a subscriber was required to
have an applied voltage of 48 volts, and modern subscriber
line circuits in semiconductor techniques are adapted to these
voltages. Higher voltages are required in other countries, for
instance 68 volts in Germany, while other applications of
semiconductor circuits may use still higher voltages, for
instance voltages of 400 volts or more.One problem with these relatively high voltages is that the
electrical field strength may exceed the critical field
strength of the semiconductor material in certain regions of
a component. This can result in a current breakthrough which
destroys the semiconductor material if the current is not
limited. The same problem of high field strength also occurs
in very small and rapid semiconductor components intended for
calculatin
