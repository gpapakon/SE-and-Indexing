<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst system for exhaust gases of internal combustion engines will be arranged close to the engine in future. This will expose them to high temperatures and high mechanical stresses. Previous systems do not comply with these requirements. In the proposed solution, support foils (1) of metal are coated with sinter metal powder (2), combine to form a support system (4) and sintered together at high temperature. Catalysts (3) can be added to the sinter metal powder (2) prior to the sintering process or can be applied subsequently. By sintering the cell structure of the support system (4) at its intersections (junctions), a mechanically strong, high-temperature resistant support system (4) is formed for arrangement close to the engine in internal combustion engines. The sinter metal powder-coating process permits a multiplicity of surface area enlargements of the support systems.
