<ABSTRACT>
In an initial predetermined period of time for 
supplying electric power to the electrically heated 

catalyst (6) mounted on the vehicle, a maximum of electric 
power is supplied from the power source (8,9) to simplify the 

complex heat control operation. Simultaneously with 
starting of the engine, the electrically heated catalyst 

is connected to the power source to start supplying the 
electric power, and a maximum electric power permitted by 

the power source (9) is supplied for a first predetermined 
period of time after which the electrically heated 

catalyst is just about to be activated. After the first 
predetermined period of time has passed, the electric 

resistance of the electrically heated catalyst is 
measured until a second predetermined period of time 

elapses. Depending upon the thus measured electric 
resistance, the amount of electric power supplied from 

the power source to the electrically heated catalyst is 
controlled by feedback so that the electric resistance of 

the electrically heated catalyst is maintained at a 
predetermined target electric resistance. The power 

source for the electrically heated catalyst may be the 
alternator (9) driven by the drive source of the vehicle. 

Furthermore, the power source may be the alternator from 
starting the engine until the first predetermined period 

of time elapses, and may, then, be the battery (8) from the 
elapse of the first predetermined period of time until 

the second predetermined period of time elapses. Being 
controlled as described above, the electric power is 

supplied to the electrically heated catalyst, immediately  
 

after starting the engine, easily and reliably.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for controlling the supply of electric power to an
electrically heated catalyst. More particularly, the
invention relates to an apparatus for controlling the
supply of electric power to an electrically heated
catalyst attached to the exhaust gas passage of an
automobile in order to heat the electrically heated
catalyst to promote the activation of the catalyst when
it is cold at the time of cold starting of an internal
combustion engine.Exhaust gases emitted from an internal
combustion engine of a vehicle contain such harmful
substances as HC (hydrocarbons) and NOx (nitrogen
oxides). In an exhaust gas passage of an internal
combustion engine is usually provided a catalytic
converter which is a device for removing impurities
contained in the exhaust gases. However, it has been
known that when the temperature of the catalyst is low
(in an inactive state), the three-way catalyst used in
the catalytic converter works to remove only some of the
harmful substances contained in the exhaust gases.
Therefore, when the catalytic converter is in the
inactive state after cold starting of the internal
combustion engine, the exhaust gases cannot be cleaned to
a sufficient degree.There has been proposed a device for cleaning
exhaust gases which is installed in the exhaust gas
passage on the upstream side of the catalytic converter,
the device incorporating an electrically heated second
catalytic converter (EHC: electrically heated catalyst) 
carrying an oxidizing catalyst and having an electric
heater, so that when the first catalytic converter is
still inactive, the second catalytic converter is
electrically heated to activate the oxidizing catalyst
and to promote the removal of HC.Electric power must be supplied to the second
catalytic converter (hereinafter referred to as
electrically heated catalyst) only until the catalytic
converter is activated. The electric power supplied to
the electrically heated catalyst can be controlled by.
detecting the temperature of the electrically heated
catalyst. A temperature sensor is usually required to
directly detect the temperature of the electrically
heated catalyst. However, the electric resistance (which
rises with an increase in the temperature) of the
electrically heated catalyst which is nearly equal to the
catalyst temperature can be detected, without using the
temperature sensor, to thereby indirectly detect the
catalyst temperature of the electrically heated catalyst.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai)
