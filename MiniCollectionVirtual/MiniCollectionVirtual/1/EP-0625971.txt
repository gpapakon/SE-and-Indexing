<ABSTRACT>
Monomeric benzotriazole, benzophenone, 3,3-diphenyl-2-cyanoacrylate, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, hindered phenol, and diazo derivatives of 4'-hydroxyacetophenone, 4-hydroxystyrene, 1,1,1-tris(4'-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, 1,3,5-tris(4'-hydroxyphenyl)benzene, and the like are disclosed. When included in polymer formulations as monomeric species or as monomers covalently incorporated into an oligomeric or polymeric structure, or as additives, such derivatives impart color or resistance to free radical, oxidative, or ultraviolet (UV) light-induced degradation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 UV LIGHT STABILIZING, ANTIOXIDANT AND COLORANT COMPOUNDSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present application relates to novel compositions that are useful as ultraviolet stabilizers, antioxidants and colorants. The compositions are derivatives of 4'- hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP) , 4-hydroxystyrene (4-HS) , l,l,l-tris(4'-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (THPE) and 1,3,5- tris (4'-hydroxyphenyl)benzene (THPB) . They can be used as additives to the materials to be protected, or optionally be chemically incorporated into polymer backbones..BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAdditives to impart ultraviolet stabilizing property or antioxidant property to polymers or to perform as colorants are known. For example, the Uvinul™ materials (from BASF Corporation, Chemicals Division, Parsippany, New Jersey) and the Tinuvin™ additives (from Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Additives Department, Hawthorne, New York) are ultraviolet stabilizers that are commercially available for use with polymers. Such additives generally are low molecular weight species, and have several problems including poor compatibility with the polymer formulation, poor dispersion into the polymer formulation, migration within the polymer, losses due to volatility of the additive material during processing or use, and leaching 

into liquids (e.g., washing of fabrics).Thus, there is a need for better materials which can function as ultraviolet stabilizing agents, antioxidants and colorants that may not have the above problems. The materials must be useful as compatible additives to polymers. They may also have functionalities which allow them to be incorporated into the backbone of polymers. When incorporated into the backbone, the protecting moieties may stay as an integral, compatible part of the product at desired concentrations.Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide molecules that carry moieties that possess ultraviolet stabilizing, antioxidant and colorant properties, and that can be used as additives to materials that need to be imparted such properties.It is another object of this invention to provide moieties that possess ultraviolet stabilizing, antioxidant and colorant properties, as well as reactive functionalities so they may be polymerized into homopolymers, or copolymerized with suitable comonomers to make copolymers, or simply be covalently incorporated into the backbone of polymers.These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent to the skilled artisan upon a review of the following description, and claims.
