<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clutch disc with friction rings which are provided both on the friction surface (4) and on the rear side (3) with trough-shaped depressions (10, 15) to reduce the weight of the said clutch disc. The trough-shaped depressions (10, 15) are of essentially rectangular or square design with fillets and with connecting surfaces (11) which slope steeply or are greatly rounded with a large radius.

<CLAIMS>
Clutch plate for a motor vehicle friction clutch, comprising a hub 
for mounting on a gearbox shaft rotatable about an axis, lining 

carriers (1) which are secured to the hub directly or with the 
interposition of a torsional vibration damper and which carry on 

each axial face a friction ring (2) with an engaging face (3) nearest 
the lining carrier, a friction face (4) furthest from the lining 

carrier, an inner profile of radius R
i
 and an outer profile of radius 
R
a
, each friction ring (2) being provided with clearance openings 
(5) leading from rivet head seatings (18) for attachment rivets (7) 

between friction ring (2) and lining carrier (1) and also with 
openings (6) for the passage of riveting tools, and each rivet head 

(8) being arranged in a trough-shaped recess (10) in the friction 
ring (2) having a seating (9) which extends parallel to the friction 

face (4), characterised in that the connecting surfaces (11) between 
seating (9) and friction face (4) extend in an inclined direction or 

with curvature. 
Clutch plate according to claim 1, characterised in that the seating 
(9) and the rivet head seating (18) are arranged in one plane. 
Clutch plate according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
connecting surfaces are sharply inclined or of large-radius 

curvature. 
Clutch plate according to claim 3, characterised in that the edge 
region (12) formed by the connecting surfaces (11) and the friction 

face (4) is closed in itself.  
 
Clutch plate according to claims 3 and 4, characterised in that a 
surrounding circumferentially uninterrupted friction face region is 

arranged between the individual radially outwardly and radially 
inwardly extending regions of the edge regions (12) and the inner 

(R
i
) and outer (R
a
) profile of the friction ring (2). 
Clutch plate accordingly to claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the 
radially outwardly and radially inwardly extending regions of the 

connecting faces (11) extend with their edge regions (12) arcuately 
about the axis of rotation (4). 
Clutch plate according to claims 3 to 6 characterised in that the 
edge region has a substantially rectangular or square outline with 

substantially radially extending circumferentially spaced sides and 
the corners rounded off. 
Clutch plate according to claims 3 to 7, characterised in that the 
openings (6) for the passage of riveting tools are likewise arranged 

in a trough-shaped recess (10). 
Clutch plate according to claims 3 to 8, characterised in that 
trough-shaped recesses (15) are likewise arranged in the engaging 

face (3) of the friction ring (2) which is nearest the lining carrier 
and these recesses are arranged in the circumferential intermediate 

spaces between the trough-shaped recesses (10) in the friction face 
(4). 
Clutch plate according to claims 3 to 9, characterised in that the 
trough-shaped recesses (10, 15) on the two faces of the friction ring  

 
(2) are of similar geometric shape with edge regions (12, 16; 13, 

17) closed in themselves and of substantially rectangular or square 
outline with rounded corners, as well as substantially radially 

extending circumferentially spaced-apart sides. 
Clutch plate according to claims 3 to 10, characterised in that the 
radially extending sides of the edge regions (12, 16) of the trough-shaped 

recesses (10, 15) have a minimal circumferential spacing 
(X). 
Clutch plate according to claims 3 to 11, there being provided 
lining carriers which have in their circumferential end regions a 

respective wave peak for axially springing the friction rings and an 
attachment rivet being mounted on an intermediate radius in each 

wave peak, characterised in that each friction ring (2) has 
circumferentially in sequence a region with a trough-shaped recess 

(10) in the friction face (4) and a region with a trough-shaped 
recess (15) in the engaging face (3) and the two friction rings (2) 

are installed in such a way that the trough-shaped recesses (15) in 
the engaging faces (3) lie axially opposite one another. 
Clutch plate according to claim 12, characterised in that all the 
trough-shaped recesses (10, 15) as well as the openings (5, 6) are 

formed by pressing in without any material-removing machining 
work.
