<ABSTRACT>
Significantly improving in the contrast ratio of a 
visual image display (100) using a liquid crystal layer 

(128) and a fiber optic faceplate (102) with tilted 
fibers (114). One preferred embodiment of the visual 

image display (100) includes a liquid crystal layer 
(128), a first polarizer (122) and an optical fiber 

faceplate (102) with many substantially parallel fibers 
(114). Each fiber (114) has an axis (116) which forms an 

oblique angle with the normal to the front surface (133) 
of the liquid crystal layer (128). All the oblique 

angles are substantially equal to a typical oblique angle 
(118). The typical oblique angle (118) is selected along 

the direction that substantially maximizes the contrast 
ratio of the display (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a visual
image display and more particularly to a visual image
display with a fiber-optic faceplate.A visual image display with a liquid crystal layer
and a fiber-optic faceplate has the advantages of
reducing glare, ghost images and parallax. The
advantages are due to the fibers in the faceplate
controlling the optical paths of light incident to and
reflecting from the liquid crystal layer. These features
are very important especially in the area of pen
computers. A general discussion of such a display can be
found in U.S. Patent 5,035,490.An optical fiber redistributes incident light.
Figure 1 shows a ray of light incident onto one end of
the fiber at an angle Ω. The light propagates through
the fiber and emits from the other end as a cone of
light. The cone of light has substantially uniform
intensity on the directrix or ring of the cone. The
angle between the axis of the fiber and the generator of
the cone is approximately Ω.A faceplate has numerous fibers bundled together.
All the fibers are substantially parallel to each other.
Figure 2 shows the top view of such a faceplate. Every
one of those honeycomb shape structures is a fiber.There are different types of liquid crystal layers.
In one type, a liquid crystal layer is sandwiched between
polarizers to form a display. A light source is
positioned above one surface of the display, and a viewer
looks at the display from the opposite surface. When a 
pre-determined electric field is applied to the liquid
crystal layer, the display becomes substantially
transparent. This is known as the "bright" state of the
liquid crystal layer. With another pre-determined
electric field, the display is significantly less
transparent. This is known as the "dark" state of the
liquid crystal layer. An important term for the liquid
crystal layer is its contrast ratio. This ratio is
defined as the ratio of the intensity of light
transmitted through the layer in its "bright" state to
its "dark" state. The larger the contrast ratio, the
easier it is to view an image on the display.In the "dark" state, the liquid crystal layer is not
uniformly "dark". The layer appears more transparent
along certain directions than along other directions.
Figure 3 shows a polar projection of the degree of
darkness from the layer in its "dark" state. It is known
as its conoscopic pattern.The conoscopic pattern shows how dark the liquid
crystal layer is as a function of both the azimuthal and
the elevational angles from the surface of the layer.
