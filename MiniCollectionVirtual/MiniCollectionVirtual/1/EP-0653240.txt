<ABSTRACT>
A filtration film element for a film separator used in a water treatment apparatus, and a method of manufacturing 
this kind of filtration film elements. A filtration film element is formed by bonding an organic filtration film, which 

consists of a plate type support member of a nonwoven cloth both surfaces of which are coated with film members, 
on the surface of a filtration plate. A part of the film members with which the support member is coated is melted to 

expose the relative part of the support member. The exposed part of this support member and the corresponding part 
of the filtration plate are then fixed to each other by bonding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing
a filter membrane element for
a membrane separation unit for use in a water treatment
apparatus or the like.From Document JP-A-63 0 72305 a bonding method for
filter membranes of a filter cartridge without excessive
dissolution of the filter membrane is known. The filter
membranes consist of a film coating which is held by a
mesh material being bonded by using adhesive.
which comprises a solvent common to a base material
and the filter membranes, at inner
and outer peripheral edges to inner and outer peripheral
rims of the base material. The film coating is only
positioned on the outer side of the mesh material and
does not come into contact with the rims. A fluid
passage way is defined by two adjacent filter membranes
fixed adjacently on both sides of the rims.In document US-A-4 804 451 a depletion compartment for a
deionization apparatus having an ion exchange membrane
is disclosed. The known ion exchange membrane is an ion
permeable resin which can be passed only by ions.
The resin of the permeable
membrane is supported on a substrate. Before bonding the
membrane to adjacent spacers of the depletion
compartments of the deionization apparatus a portion of
the ion exchange resin is removed from one side of the
substrate by skiving. The exposed substrate is then
adhesively bonded to the spacers of the depletion
compartments. For joining the membrane to the adjacent 
spacers the use of various adhesives, hot-melt
adhesives, direct heat weld, thermoplastic interlays,
contact adhesives and pressure sensitive hot melt
adhesives, is disclosed. The known method for joining
the membrane to the spacers requires a first step to
remove the ion exchange resin and a second step to apply
the adhesive to the exposed support and to join the
membrane to the spacers.Document JP-A-62 033523 discloses that a permeable
membrane for selectively passing through it a specific
composition of a fluid mixture can be bonded by adhesive
to a support plate at an peripheral adhesive portion
thereof and a spacer can be disposed at an inner side of
the adhesive portion.Document US 4 302 270 A discloses a method for
making an ultrafiltration membrane assembly comprising
an ultrafiltration membrane element including a thin membrane
having a high polymer melt temperature mechanically joined
to a porous support sheet, a coarse fabric drainage mat
and an imprevious backing plate, by heat sealing the edges
of the assembly. A fused bond is provided between the porous
support sheet and the

A method of manufacturing a filter membrane element
wherein an organic filter membrane (11) having a plate-like

support member (12) made of nonwoven fabric and a
film coating (13) formed on both sides of the support

member (12) is joined with a surface of a filter plate
(14), said method comprising dissolving a portion of said

film coating (13) thereby to cause the support member
(12) to be exposed at the dissolved portion thereof, and

subsequently joining the exposed portion of the support
member (12) with a corresponding portion of the filter

plate (14) by means of fusion bonding.
