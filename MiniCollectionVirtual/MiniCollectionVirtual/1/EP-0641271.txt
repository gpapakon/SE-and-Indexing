Welding process using high-energy welding 
beams, especially laser beams, in which two controlled 

welding beams (10, 11) are directed simultaneously onto 
two opposed external surfaces (13, 14) of a workpiece 

and the workpiece thickness (d) of the welding zone 
(12) melts proportionately with the formation of vapour 

capillaries, 
characterised in that
 the welding beams 
(10, 11) are controlled in the sense to form a vapour 

capillary which is continuous between the workpiece 
external surfaces, wherein at least one (10 or 11) of 

these two welding beams (10, 11) is controlled, by a 
process regulation matched to short-term process 

events, in relation to the position of the vapour 
capillary (15) of the other (11 or 10) of the two 

welding beams (10, 11) forming the said continuous 
vapour capillary. 
Process according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 both welding beams (10, 11) are directed onto the 
welding zone (12) at an angle relative to the welding 

direction (x
s

workpiece external surfaces (13, 14). 
Process according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that

a coordinated manner. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
3, 
characterised in that
 the control of the welding 
beams (10, 11) is effected in dependence upon radiation 

(17') passing through the vapour capillary (15) and/or 
radiation (18) of other wavelengths coupled into the 

beam path.  
 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
4, 
characterised in that
 a control of one welding beam 
(10) is only effected if the power of the radiation 

(17', 18) passing through the vapour capillary (15) 
departs from a range between two predetermined 

threshold values specific to the application. 
Process according to claim 5, 
characterised in 
that
 if a lower threshold value is not achieved then 
first the position of the one welding head (16) is 

controlled and then, if necessary, the radiation energy 
of one welding beam (10) or both welding beams (10, 11) 

is increased. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
6, 
characterised in that
 if the upper threshold value 
is exceeded then the welding speed is increased and/or 

the radiation energy of one welding beam (10) or both 
welding beams (10, 11) is reduced. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
7, 
characterised in that
 the continuity of the vapour 
capillary (15) and/or its position in the welding zone 

(12) and/or irregularities in the movements of the melt 
due to plasma fluctuations are monitored. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
8, 
characterised in that
 a radiation-decoupling mirror 
(24) is used for the detection of the radiation (17, 

18) passing through the vapour capillary (15). 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 
to 9, 
characterised in that
 an on-line process 
monitoring is effected by optical and/or acoustic 

sensors (45, 46, 47) which detect the weld seam (22) 

behind the particular welding zone (12). 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 
to 10, 
characterised in that
 the position of the 
welding beams (10, 11) is controlled in dependence upon 

the formation of the weld seam (22) and/or its position  
 

in the welded workpiece (23). 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 
to 11, 
characterised in that
 ultrasound and/or a 
measurement of the thermal radiation of the weld seam 

(22) and/or of the welded workpiece (23) is used for 
the process monitoring. 
Process, particularly according to one or more 
of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that

with laser radiation, which is directed substantially 

transversely to the welding direction (x
s
) onto the 
welding zone (12) of the workpiece (23) and is inclined 

in relation to one workpiece external surface (13, 14),

polarisation direction (p) subtends an included angle 
of about 45Â° with reference to the welding direction
