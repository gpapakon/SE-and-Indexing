<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANALYSIS IN REAL TIME, INDUSTRIAL USAGE MODECROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is closely related to the U.S.Patent 5,015,954 issued on 14 May 1991 to Dechene et al., and to U.S. Patent 5,049,819 granted Sept. 17, 1991 to Dechene et al . , both entitled "Magnetic Resonance Analysis in Real Time, Industrial Usage Mode" . Both of these patents are of common assignment with this application, and the disclosures of both are hereby incorporated herein by reference, as though set out at length herein.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an instrument for measurement of the type and quantity of lattice bound and free magnetically active nuclei within successive samples of a process material flow through pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and more particularly the application of such measurement to industrial process control of moisture content, polymer content, crystallinity fraction, oil/fat fraction and other percentages of components analysis and other parameters. 

 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNMR techniques have grown extensively over the past forty years, most notably in the medical instrumentation areas where in vivo examination of various parts of the human body can be seen, and in clinical research laboratory uses. In addition there has been some use and interest in the application of these techniques to industrial instrumentation and control tasks. The present invention enables effective utilization (technically and economically) of pulsed NMR techniques in industrial areas to replace or complement existing optical and radiant energy-based instrumentation. Pulsed NMR spectroscopy is described in our above-cited patent. This technique uses a burst or pulse which is designed to excite the nuclei of a particular nuclear species of a sample being measured (the protons, or the like, of such sample having first been precessed in an essentially static magnetic field) ; in other words the precession is modified by the pulse. After the application of the pulse there occurs a free induction decay (FID) of the magnetization associated with the excited nuclei. Traditional Fourier Transform analysis generates a frequency domain spectrum which can be used to advantage in studying the nuclei of interest. The duration of the pulses, the time between the pulses, the pulse phase angle and the composition of the sample are parameters which affect the sensitivity of this technique. These frequency domain techniques are not easily useable
