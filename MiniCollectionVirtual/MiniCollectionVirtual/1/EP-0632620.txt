<ABSTRACT>
A technique for modifying the IEEE 802.3 standard for selecting backoff 
times in a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) network, 

in the event that a collision is sensed by a node that has captured the network 
communication channel. If there is a small number of active nodes on the network, one 

node may capture the channel and the standard backoff algorithm makes it increasingly 
unlikely for another node to transmit. The new technique provides for less aggressive, i.e. 

longer, backoff times before at least the first retransmission attempt made by a node that 
has captured the channel. Three specific examples of the technique are disclosed. Even 

though the invention represents a departure from the standard CSMA/CD backoff 
algorithm, the overall average backoff times provided by the invention can be selected 

to be consistent with the average times provided by the standard. Moreover, nodes using 
the invention interoperate successfully with nodes that do not.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to local area
networks (LANs) of the Ethernet type and, more particularly,
to techniques for improving fairness of channel access in an
Ethernet™ LAN. Ethernet™ is a commonly used name for a LAN that
uses a network access protocol referred to as Carrier Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). The
CSMA/CD protocol is defined in ANSI/IEEE Std 802.3, published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
Inc., 345 East 45th Street, New York, NY 10017, and referred
to in this specification as "the IEEE 802.3 standard." The
standard is for a 10 Mbps (megabits/sec) CSMA/CD channel, but
it will be understood that the present invention may also be
applicable to a 100 Mbps channel.Under the CSMA/CD rules for access to a network bus
or cable, which will be referred to as the channel, any node
or station wishing to transmit must first "listen" to make 
sure that the channel is clear before beginning to transmit.
All nodes on the network have equal priority of access and may
begin transmitting as soon as the channel is idle and a
required inter-packet delay of 9.6 µs (microseconds) has
elapsed. However, if a first node that has started transmitting
detects a "collision" with a transmission from another
node, the first node continues transmitting for a short time
to make sure that all nodes wishing to transmit will detect
the collision. Every other node detecting the collision also
continues to transmit for a short time. Then each node that
has detected a collision terminates transmission of the packet
or frame. The nodes involved in the collision wait for the
required interpacket gap of 9.6 µs and then select random,
and therefore usually different, delay times, referred to as
backoff times, before trying transmission of the same packet
again.More specifically, the IEEE 802.3 standard defines
a collision backoff procedure referred to as "truncated binary
exponential backoff." When a transmission attempt has
terminated due to a collision, it is retried by the transmitting
node, after a selected backoff time, until either the
transmission is successful or a maximum number of attempts
have been made and all have terminated due to collisions. The
backoff time is selected by each node as an integral multiple
of the "slot time," which is the maximum round-trip propagation
time for the network, i.e. the time to propagate a data 
packet from one end of the network to the other, and back. The
maximum slot time defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard is 51.2 µs. The
