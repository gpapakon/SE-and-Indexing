<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a joint in an optical line that extends along a phase conductor (1) of a high voltage overhead power transmission system, comprises: (i) forming a length of optical cable (10) which comprises a plurality of optical fibres; (ii) encapsulating the optical fibres; (iii) providing an intermediate region of the length of optical cable with an outer, non-tracking jacket (12) so that a part of the length of optical cable extends from each end of the outer, non-tracking jacket; (iv) installing the jacket so that it extends between phase potential and any other potential to which the cable will be subjected; and (v) connecting one end of the optical fibres of the optical cable to fibres in the optical line of the phase conductor (1), and connecting the other end of the optical fibres of the optical cable to another optical line. The parts of the length of the optical cable that extend from each end of the outer, non-tracking jacket (12) have a sufficient length that connections can be formed between the optical fibres and the optical lines at points remote from regions in which the cable extends along high electrical field gradients. This has the advantage that the optical fibres of the assembly which, in use, will extend between the potential of the phase conductor and earth can be encapsulated in the factory under controlled conditions, and conventional means may be employed to connect the cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL CONNECTION IN HV LINEThis invention relates to overhead electrical transmission systems that include one or more optical transmission lines, and, in particular, those systems in which the optical transmission line is located in the region of a phase conductor so that it is at, or close to, phase potential.Examples of such systems include those in which the optical transmission line forms part of the phase conductor, for example as described in DE-A-26 04 766, and those in which the optical line extends along the outside of the electrical phase conductor. Optical cables that extend along the outside of the electrical phase conductor may be attached to it by lashing, or may be wrapped around the phase conductor, for example as described in EP-A-0 122 163.In any system in which the optical line extends along the phase conductor, the optical line must, at some stage, be brought down to earth potential in order to be connected to other parts of the optical communication system. Examples of methods of terminating such optical systems are described in EP-A-0 122 163 mentioned above, EP-A-0 067 614, EP-A-0433 565 and DE-C-42 27 410. These methods of terminating the optical lines rely on the provision of an outer, non-tracking jacket that extends between the phase potential and earth potential, and encloses the optical fibres between the two potentials. The purpose of the jacket is to protect the optical fibres from the elements, and, more importantly, from the electrical currents or discharges on the 

assembly surface caused by the electrical field gradients in this region. The jacket should be non-tracking, and will usually have a shedded or convoluted outer surface. Furthermore, the interior of the jacket in this region may have to be substantially void- free since voids can cause electrical discharge activity in the assembly due to the high electrical field gradient, and so allow damage to the optical fibres. In view of this, the optical fibres have typically been encapsulated in an oil or grease within the jacket. In other circumstances, even if it is not necessary to ensure that the interior of the assembly is substantially void-free, it may be necessary to ensure that the cable is fully water-blocked, the fibres are physically protected from vibration, any heat-shrunk component is correctly applied (e.g. to ensure that any mastic or hot-melt adhesive present is correctly applied).The assemblies that have been proposed in the prior art for transferring optical fibres between phase conductors and
