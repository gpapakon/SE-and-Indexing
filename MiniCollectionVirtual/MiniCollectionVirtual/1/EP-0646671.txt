<ABSTRACT>
An ironing board (1) with a folding stand (4), particularly 
for household use, has an elongate body (2) with an ironing top 

surface (3) supported on the stand (4), which stand has at least 
two legs (5,6) hinge connected to the elongate body (2) of which 

one has a movable hinge (13). A spring-action means (20) is 
arranged to act on the movable hinge (13) leg (6), and a 

releasable locking means (28) is provided for locking the stand 
(4) to the elongate body (2) in the folded condition against the 

bias of said spring-action means (20) which provides a force to 
assist in the raising of the elongate body (2) during the ironing 

board (1) erecting operation and prevents the elongate body (2) 
from being dropped during the reverse operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ironing board with a folding 
stand, particularly for household use. Ironing boards of this type comprise an elongate body having 
an ironing top surface and being supported on a folding stand 
which has at least two legs hinge connected together and to the 
elongate body. Such a construction is both steady and compact, but the 
elongate body itself is a heavy and unwieldy part. This aspect is the more apparent when the elongate body 
incorporates such accessory items as a rest plate for the iron and 
an arrangement for sucking steam away from the ironing top 
surface. The heavy weight of the elongate body is a contributing 
factor to the ironing board steadiness during the ironing 
operations, and accordingly, the suppression of this feature in 
order to make the ironing board easier to handle would be 
undesirable. The unwieldy character of the elongate body bears out 
especially in folding and unfolding the stand supporting the 
elongate body. During the unfolding operation, the elongate body must be 
raised bodily to its working level, so that the stand legs can be 
extended and engaged in their working positions for a convenient 
level setting.  During the folding operation, upon disengaging the legs, the 
elongate body tends to fall and suddenly fold up the stand. Unless this fall is opposed manually, the elongate body may 
become damaged or, more important still, injure individuals. It is the object of this invention to provide an ironing 
board as indicated which can overcome the drawbacks with which the 
prior art is beset. This object is achieved, according to the invention, by an 
ironing board comprising an elongate body with an ironing top 
surface, being supported on a folding stand which has at least two 
legs hinged to each other and to the elongate body by respective 
hinge connections of which at least one is movable along the 
elongate body, characterized in that it further comprises a 
spring-action means arranged to act directly on the movable hinge 
leg in a leg spreading direction, and a releasable locking means 
for locking the legs to the elongate body in the folded position 
against the bias of said spring-action means. A major advantage of an ironing board according to this 
invention is that the spring-action means assists in unfolding the 
stand and slows down the fall of the elongate body by opposing the 
stand folding movement. Another advantage is that this ironing board is simple 
construction-wise and easy and safe to use. Further features
