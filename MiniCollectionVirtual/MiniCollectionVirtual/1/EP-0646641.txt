Pyrrolidone compounds stabilize proteolytic enzymes in 
aqueous solution and hence are useful in contact lens 

cleaning preparations containing proteolytic enzymes. 
Preferably, the preparations also contain a surfactant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a method of
stabilizing preparations for contact lenses containing
proteolytic enzymes but not containing free calcium ions,
which method comprises adding to the preparations a
pyrrolidone compound selected from pyrrolidonecarboxylic
acid and salts and esters thereof at a concentration of not
less than 5 (w/v) % (as calculated when the preparation
contains, or is dissolved in water to contain, 10 to 5,000
units/cm3 of the proteolytic enzyme).Contact lenses are roughly classified into two types;
hard and soft contact lenses. Although hard contact
lenses, with their non-hydrophilic property, usually show
reduced oxygen permeability, hard contact lenses with
improved oxygen permeability have recently been developed.
However, both kinds of contact lenses are readily deposited
with, for example, proteins, and in addition, oxygen-permeable
lenses require daily care by cleaning (including
cleansing), sterilization and preservation in order to
maintain their desired oxygen permeability.Proteolytic enzymes are used to remove protein
adhered on the surface of contact lenses and there have
been proposed and put in use a great variety of cleaning
preparations containing proteolytic enzymes. For example,
preparations composed mainly of proteolytic enzymes, which
are supplied in the form of solids, such as tablets,
granules and powders, are dissolved in, for example,
purified water at the time of cleaning of contact lenses by
their wearers. As a result, the wearers are forced to
endure not only inconvenience from increased costs and
troublesome procedures, but also they are troubled with
time-course reduction in enzymatic activity after
dissolution. There have been proposed methods of stabilizing a
proteolytic enzyme in solution; for example, JP-A-159822/1988
and JP-A-180515/1989 propose stabilizing a
proteolytic enzyme by incorporating the proteolytic enzyme
into a solution containing a water-miscible polyhydric
alcohol. However, the resultant solution hardly exhibits
enzymatic activity and, whilst it can be diluted with water
to produce increased enzymatic activity, it suffers from
the disadvantage of poor stability.JP-A-5179291 discloses that the protease activity in a
liquid detergent composition comprising a surfactant and a
metal blocking agent (eg ethane-1,1-diphosphonate) is
stabilized by free calcium ion and either or both
alkanolamine and pyrrolidone carboxylate. It is stated
that concentrations of pyrrolidone carboxylate in excess of
5 % by weight do not produce a marked
