<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for making an inactivated vaccine of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae by inactivating the bacteria with Thimerosal. The resulting bacterin is mixed with an adjuvant of aluminum hydroxide and DEAE dextran and injected into pigs. The resulting bacterin and adjuvant mixture can also be mixed with other bacteria such as Bordetella and Pasteurella, for further adjuvant effect. Protective immunity against mycoplasmal pneumonia is elicited in swine using these vaccines.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INACTIVATED MYCOPLASMA HYOPNEUMONIAE AND USES THEREFORThis application is a continuation-in-part of Serial Number 07/841,632, filed February 27, 1992, hereby incorporated by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to methods for preparing Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccines and diagnostic agents.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Chronic pneumonia in swine has been recognized as a major problem in swine production for almost a century. The disease has a high morbidity with low mortality causing a chronic cough, dull hair coat, retarded growth and unthrifty appearance lasting several weeks. Characteristic lesions of purple to gray areas of consolidation particularly in ventral apical and cardiac lobes are observed in infected animals. Death may result from secondary infection or stress. One of the causes of chronic pneumonia is infection by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Economic losses alone have been estimated at between 200 to 250 million dollars annually. The bacteria was first identified in 1965. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is a slow growing, fastidious bacterium which lacks a cell wall. It is frequently difficult to isolate from the respiratory tract due to Mycoplasma hyorhinis, a common secondary agent also located in the respiratory tract. The disease is spread by aerosol, produced by coughing, and by direct contact from an affected or convalescent carrier swine. Mingling of infected animals and uninfected animals results in early and frequent reinfection. Infection frequently starts with infection of piglets by carrier sows at farrowing. Because of current herd management techniques, infection may remain silent until later in life. Additional infection usually is observed after weaning when pigs are pooled. Overt disease is normally observed in pigs at six weeks of age or older. Average animal growth rates are reduced by about 16% with feed conversion rates being reduced by about 22%. 

 Surveys of slaughtered animals revealed lesions typical of Mycoplasma pneumonia in 30-80% of swine. Results from 337 herds in 13 states indicated that 99% of the herds had hogs with pneumonia lesions typical of Mycoplasma pneumonia. Therefore, the need for effective preventative and treatment measures are grea .Tiamulin, trimethoprim, tetracyclines and lincomycin have been shown to have some benefit. However, antibiotics are expensive and require prolonged use. Additionally, reinfection is an ever present problem. Antibiotics have not been shown to effectively eliminate spread of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae.
