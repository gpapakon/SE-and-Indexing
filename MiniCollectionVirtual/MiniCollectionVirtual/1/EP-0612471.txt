<DESCRIPTION>
The formation of slimes by microorganisms is a problem 
that is encountered in many aqueous systems. For example, the 
problem is not only found in natural waters such as lagoons, 
lakes, ponds, etc., and confined waters as in pools, but also in 
such industrial systems as cooling water systems, air washer 
systems and pulp and paper mill systems. All possess conditions 
which are conducive to the growth and reproduction of slime-forming 
microorganisms. In both once-through and recirculating 
cooling systems, for example, which employ large quantities of 
water as a cooling medium, the formation of slime by micro-organisms 
is an extensive and constant problem. Airborne organisms are readily entrained in the water 
from cooling towers and find this warm medium an ideal environment 
for growth and multiplication. Aerobic and heliotropic 
organisms flourish on the tower proper while other organisms 
colonize and grow in such areas as the tower sump and the piping 
and passages of the cooling system. The slime formation not 
only aids in the deterioration of the tower structure in the  
 
case of wooden towers, but also promotes corrosion when it 
deposits on metal surfaces. Slime carried through the cooling 
system plugs and fouls lines, valves, strainers, etc., and 
deposits on heat exchange surfaces. In the latter case, the 
impedance of heat transfer can greatly reduce the efficiency of 
the cooling system. In pulp and paper mill systems, slime formed by micro-organisms 
is commonly encountered and causes fouling, plugging, 
or corrosion of the system. The slime also becomes entrained 
in the paper produced to cause breakouts on the paper machines, 
which results in work stoppages and the loss of production 
time. The slime is also responsible for unsightly blemishes in 
the final product, which result in rejects and wasted output. The previously discussed problems have resulted in the 
extensive utilization of biocides in cooling water and pulp and 
paper mill systems. Materials which have enjoyed widespread use 
in such applications include chlorine, chlorinated phenols, 
organo-bromines, and various organo-sulfur compounds. All of 
these compounds are generally useful for this purpose but each 
is attended by a variety of impediments. For example, chlorination 
is limited both by its specific toxicity for slime-forming 
organisms at economic levels and by the tendency of chlorine to 
react, which results in the expenditure of the chlorine before 
its full biocidal function is achieved. Other
