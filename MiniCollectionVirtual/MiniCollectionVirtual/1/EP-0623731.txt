<ABSTRACT>
Door with a flexible roll-up shutter (4) for closing off an opening (5), comprising two lateral uprights, each having a slideway forming a narrowing (7), the shutter (4) basically forming a plane and comprising lateral edges which slide within the said narrowing (7) and are fitted with projections protruding outside the plane of the shutter, the said projections being positioned so as to be basically continuous along the lateral edges of the shutter and being designed to press in a basically sealing manner against the narrowing (7) of the slideways at least when the shutter (4) is subjected to a tensile force in the direction of the inside of the opening (5), the said projections being sufficiently flexible to pass through the said narrowing (7) when the said tensile force exceeds a predetermined value, characterised in that the said projections are made of a flexible elastic material in sheet form (20, 21) which is securely attached to the lateral edges of the shutter, and the said sheet material diverges away from each lateral edge of the shutter, to each side of the shutter plane.
