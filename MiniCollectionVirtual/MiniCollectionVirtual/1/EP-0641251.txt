<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
oxygen absorber and oxygen-absorbing method, especially for 
absorbing oxygen in low temperature environments. By way of background, particulate iron is known 
as an oxygen absorber because it readily combines with 
oxygen. In the past, various types of particulate iron 
have been used, including hydrogen reduced iron, electrolytically 
reduced iron, atomized iron, and milled 
pulverized iron. However, the hydrogen reduced iron, the 
atomized iron and the milled pulverized iron absorb oxygen 
relatively slowly. The electrolytically reduced iron 
absorbs oxygen faster but at lower temperatures at which 
food are normally refrigerated it absorbs oxygen at a 
slower rate than desired to remove the oxygen before the 
initial stages of food spoilage commence. It is the primary object of the present invention 
to provide an improved oxygen-absorbing composition 
which includes particulate annealed electrolytically 
reduced iron which will provide a more rapid rate of oxygen 
absorption than plain electrolytically reduced iron, 
especially at lower temperatures. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide an improved method of oxygen absorption utilizing 
particulate annealed electrolytically reduced iron. Other 
objects and attendant advantages of the present invention 
will readily be perceived hereafter. The improved oxygen-absorbing composition 
comprises in relatively sufficient proportions particulate 
annealed electrolytically reduced iron, and salt means for 
producing an electrolyte so as to activate the iron. The improved method of absorbing oxygen from a 
product in a closed container which is subjected to 
temperatures below 10°C (50° F.) comprises the steps of placing  
 
said product into a container which is to be subjected to 
temperatures below 10°C (50° F.), and adding a mixture of particulate 
annealed electrolytically reduced iron and a salt to the 
container. The present invention also relates to a packet 
for absorbing oxygen comprising an oxygen-absorbing 
composition, and an envelope containing said oxygen-absorbing 
composition, said envelope comprising a laminate 
of material contacting layer, water and grease resistant 
paper, a first sealing layer between said material contacting 
layer and said water and grease resistant paper, and a 
second sealing layer on the opposite side of said laminate 
from said material contacting layer. The present invention also relates to a laminate 
for fabrication into an envelope comprising a
