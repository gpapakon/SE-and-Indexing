<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic component, for example a plastic housing (casing) or a wiring support for electrical telecommunications equipment, whose walls (15) are permanently connected to at least partially metallised plastic films (16). In this case, reliable electrical screening and a simple capability for wiring are produced in that the walls (15) have at least two successive metallised plastic films (16, 18) which are permanently connected to one another, and in that the first film (16), which is adjacent to the walls, is provided with a metallised coating (17) over the whole of its area, and the second film (18) is provided on its outside with a metallic coating, which is constructed in regions, in the form of conductor tracks (19).
