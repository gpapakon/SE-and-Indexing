<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for the volumetric metering of fluid substances, such as for example liquids or bulk goods, which are put into a metering container (1) which is essentially closed and has at least one supply opening (21) and at least one deaeration opening (22) or in which a metering container (1) is filled from a supply container which is essentially closed and has at least one ventilation opening. In order to provide a method and a device of the type described at the beginning which enable a volumetric metering with high accuracy without great costs in terms of apparatus, it is proposed according to the invention that during the supply of a fluid substance into the metering container (1), the volume discharge flow of the gas flowing out through the deaeration opening (22) or of the gas flowing through the ventilation opening into the supply container is measured, provision being made for the device of equipment (9) for detecting the gas volume which escapes through the deaeration opening (22) during the supply of the fluid substance via the supply opening (21) or flows in through the ventilation opening.
