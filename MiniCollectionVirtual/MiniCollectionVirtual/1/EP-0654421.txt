<ABSTRACT>
A saddle which is favourable in terms of material use and weight, in particular for small and medium-sized containers between the tank and the front frame comprises a front ring (11) welded to the tank bottom (10) and two saddle ring segments (15) inserted between the front ring (11) and the two corner supports (14) of the front frame. Each saddle ring segment (15) has a radial flange (16) which rests in an overlapping manner against a face of the corner support (14) parallel to said radial flange and an axial flange (17) extending parallel to and overlapping the front ring (11).

<CLAIMS>
A tank container having a substantially cylindrical 
tank, each curved bottom of the tank being connected to the 

respective end frame via a saddle structure which includes an 
end ring (
11
) fixed to the tank bottom (
10
) and two saddle 
ring segments (
15
) inserted between the end ring and the end 
frame (
14
),
 
   wherein each saddle ring segment (
15
) includes a profile 
element of L-shaped cross-section having an axial flange (
17
) 
extending parallel to the tank axis, overlapping the annular 

ring (
11
) and being connected thereto, and a radial flange 
(
16
) extending transversely of, and away from, the tank axis, 
overlapping a parallel surface of a corner strut (
14
) of the 
end frame and being connected thereto. 
The tank container of claim 1, characterised in that the 
end ring (
11
) includes a radial flange (
13
) extending toward 
the tank axis. 
The tank container of claim 1 or 2, characterised by a 
connecting element (
17
) disposed in a radial plane and having 
an edge connected to an inner surface of the corner strut 

(
14
) facing the tank axis, and a lateral surface connected to 
the free edge of the axial flange (
17
) of the saddle ring 
segment (
15
). 
The tank container of any of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that either end of the saddle ring segment (
15
) is 
provided with a terminating element (
19
) welded to both legs 
(
16
, 
17
) thereof and to the surface of the corner strut (
14
) 
facing the tank axis. 
The tank container of claim 4, characterised in that the 
terminating element (
19
) is substantially trapezoidal, with 
one edge having a length corresponding to the axial flange 

(
17
) of the saddle ring segment (
15
) and the opposite edge 
having a length corresponding to the width of the corner 

strut.
