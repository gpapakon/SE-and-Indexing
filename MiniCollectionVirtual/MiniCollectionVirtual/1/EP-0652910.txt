<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for making a biodegradable
polymeric composition of the type including starch and
synthetic thermoplastics polymers, suitable for the
production of biodegradable articles having satisfactory
physical and mechanical properties, by means of
conventional techniques applied to thermoplastics
materials of synthetic origin.Thermoplastics compositions of the type specified above
are known and available commercially and are described,
for example, in patent applications EP-A-0 032 802, EP-A-0
327 505, WO 90/10671, EP-A-0 400 532, EP-A-0 404 723,
EP-A-0 404 727, EP-A-0 404 728, WO 91/02024, WO 91/02025
and US 5,095,054.Typically these compositions can be obtained by the
mixing of a starch component with a synthetic
thermoplastics polymeric component in conditions typical
of the "extrusion-cooking" process, that is in the presence of
a limited quantity of water (typically 5-40% by weight
with reference to the starch-water system) or of a
plastisizer at a high enough temperature and pressure to
destroy the crystalline structure of the starch and to
obtain a molten thermoplastics mass.JP-A-04 136 047 & Patent Abstract of Japan Vol 16, no 406 (C-978)(5449) discloses to mix starch, a synthetic polymer and a natural filler and a plasticizer in a single step.The object of the present invention is to provide 
a process for making compositions of the type specified above which have
improved mechanical properties, particularly a higher
rigidity, even in the presence of high humidity, and
properties of processability comparable with those of
conventional plastics, while retaining or surpassing the
rate of biodegradability of the known compositions.This object is achieved by the process of claim 1; the polymeric
composition comprises a matrix including a natural starch
and at least one synthetic thermoplastics
polymeric component in which a filler is dispersed,
characterised in that the matrix includes a fluidising
agent selected from the group consisting of:
C12-C22 fatty acids, C12-C22 fatty alcohols, esters and
amides of the said fatty acids, polyolefin waxes and
polyglycol ethers of alditols or polyglycerols esterified
with the said fatty acids and their mixtures and the said
filler comprises natural fillers of an organic nature
dispersed in the matrix in quantities of from 5% to 70%
by weight with reference to the total weight of the
composition.The materials constituting the fillers are preferably
selected from wood flour, walnut shells, cellulose,
cotton, jute, raffia, rice
