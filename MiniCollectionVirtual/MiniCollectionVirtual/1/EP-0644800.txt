<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support for a three-way catalyst and to a method of producing the support, the support containing cerium. In order to promote the catalytic performance of the cerium in the support, at least one of the following elements of the lanthanide group is added to the support: europium, terbium, ytterbium, samarium, or praseodymium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a support of a three-way catalyst, the
support containing cerium. The invention also relates to a
method of producing the support. The invention additionally
relates to a three-way catalyst containing such a support.The basic structure of a catalyst comprises a carrier, a
support layer, and catalyst metals. On the surface of either a
ceramic or a metallic honeycomb of a carrier there is usually
gamma-Al2O3 as a support. Its function is, among other things,
to form a maximal surface for the noble metals serving as catalysts.
For example, alkaline earth metals and lanthanides are
used as additives improving, among other things, the thermal
durability of this support.By a three-way catalyst is meant a catalyst in which, simultaneously,
carbon monoxide is oxidized to carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons
are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, and nitrogen
oxides are reduced to nitrogen. These reactions occur catalyzed
by catalytically active elements. These elements are
typically, for example platinum, rhodium, palladium or ruthenium.
The catalytically active substance used in a three-way
catalyst may also contain a number of base metals. Ruthenium
and nickel are known as catalysts for the reduction of NO. Fe,
Cu, Mn, Sn, Ge, U, Re, Ga and Y have also been used as additives.
The base metals are added by impregnation with their
nitrate, chloride, acetate and citrate solutions. In the catalyst
support there is commonly used cerium, the function of
which is to store oxygen. It does this by changing its oxidation
number, as is described below in greater detail.DE application publication 2 339 513 discloses a method in
which a metal honeycomb is coated, before the adding of the 
catalyst layer, with a slurry made by mixing Ce(NO3)3Â·6H2O with
activated Al2O3 powder in water. This slurry was dried, ground
and calcined, whereafter it was mixed with water and nitric
acid. The honeycomb was dipped in this mixture before it was
coated with a catalyst.FI application 883971 discloses an exhaust gas purifying
catalyst made up of a monolithic support on the surface of
which there is produced a layer of active alumina which
contains cerium oxide in addition to other compounds. In FI
application 884977, the cerium oxide content is varied
according to the form in which the alumina is used; the Al2O3
may be either on the surface of an inert, porous or monolithic
carrier or in the form of profiled separate pieces.GB patent 1 492 929 discloses a catalyst in which there is, on
the surface of a metal substrate,
