<ABSTRACT>
A sealing strip for sealing between a flange (22) defining 
a door opening, such as in a motor vehicle body, and the 

door (24) of the opening, comprises a channel-shaped 
gripping part (12) for gripping the flange (22) and 

supporting a hollow tubular sealing part (14), preferably 
made of sponge rubber. The latter is partially compressed 

between the flange (22) and the closing door (24) so as to 
provide a barrier seal against ingress of moisture and 

draught. In order to provide improved blocking of 
acoustic energy, so as to reduce the amount of exterior 

noise (road noise, aerodynamic noise) transmitted into the 
interior of the vehicle, the sealing part (14) also 

carries an acoustic screen (30) which is made of material 
having increased acoustic energy attenuating properties as 

compared with the sponge rubber of the sealing part (14). 
The acoustic screen (30) carries notches (32) to increase 

its flexibility, and is positioned substantially clear of 
the door (24) and the bodywork (23) adjacent the frame, so 

as to minimise any increased effort required for closing 
the door and to maximise its acoustic energy blocking 

action.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sealing strip for sealing around at 
least part of the frame of an opening closable by a closure 
member, comprising compressible material positioned to be 
compressed between the frame and the closing closure member to 
provide a barrier seal. Such a sealing strip is known, for example, from DE-A-3 527 094 
or from US-A-4 143 497. However, although the compressible 
material, such as foamed or low density elastomeric material, 
used in such sealing strips provides good sealing characteristics 
against water, moisture or draughts, it may be less satisfactory 
as an acoustic screen - that is, it may provide low resistance 
to the transmission of exterior noise into the interior of the 
vehicle. The invention aims to deal with this problem. The known sealing strip is therefore characterised, in accordance 
with the invention, in that the sealing strip comprises, in 
combination with the compressible material, additional material 
having a higher acoustic impedance than that of the compressible 
material and being so positioned in relation to the compressible  
 
material as to attenuate acoustic wave energy tending to pass 
between the frame and the closed closure member. Sealing strips embodying the invention will now be described by 
way of example only and with reference to the  
 
accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a known form of sealing 
strip; Figure 2 is a cross-section through the sealing strip of 
Figure 1, but showing it mounted on a bodywork flange 
surrounding a door opening in a vehicle body; Figure 3 corresponds to Figure 2 but shows the 
configuration which the sealing strip adopts when the door 
closes in the opening;  Figure 4 is a cross-section corresponding to Figure 2 but 
showing a sealing strip embodying the invention;  Figure 5 corresponds to Figure 4 but shows the 
configuration which the sealing strip adopts when the door 
closes into the opening;  Figures 6 and 7 correspond respectively to Figures 4 and 5 
but show a different form of sealing strip embodying the 
invention;  Figures 8 and 9 correspond to Figures 4 and 5 but show a 
further form of sealing strip embodying the invention; and  
 Figure 10 corresponds to Figure 4 and shows yet a further 
form of sealing strip embodying the invention. In all the Figures, corresponding parts are indicated by 
the same reference numerals. The sealing strip of Figures 1,2 and 3 comprises a 
longitudinally extending channel-shaped gripping part 12 
on one outside wall of which is

<CLAIMS>
A sealing strip for sealing around at least part of the 
frame of an opening closable by a closure member (24), comprising 

compressible material (14) positioned to be compressed between 
the frame (22) and the closing closure member (24) to provide a 

barrier seal, characterised in that the sealing strip comprises, 
in combination with the compressible material (14), additional 

material (30) having a higher acoustic impedance than that of the 
compressible material (14) and being so positioned in relation 

to the compressible material (14) as to attenuate acoustic wave 
energy tending to pass between the frame (22) and the closed 

closure member (14).

the additional material (30) is positioned so as to minimise its 

effect on the compressibility of the compressible material (14). 
A sealing strip according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the additional material (30) is connected to the compressible 

material (14) and is provided with longitudinally extending 
notches (32) to increase its flexibility in response to 

compression of the compressible  
 

material (14).

characterised in that the compressible material is in the 

form of a hollow tube (14) which is partially collapsed by 
compression by the closing closure member (24), and in 

that the additional material (30) is mounted on a part of 
the wall of the tube (14) which is substantially clear of 

both the closing closure (24) member and the frame (22). 
A strip according to claim 4, characterised in that 
th
e additional material (30) is positioned on the outside 
of the wall of the tube (14).

characterised in that the compressible material is in the 

form of a hollow tube (14) which is positioned to be 
partially collapsed by the closing closure member (24),
