<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for the controlled dosage of NO to the air supply of patients with ARDS or similar disorders, essentially comprises a ventilator (1), an NO metering vessel (3), a metering unit (4), an analyser (2) for determining the concentration of NO in the patient's air supply and a control unit (6a) acting upon the metering unit. In order to achieve interference-free functioning of the apparatus in continuous operation and a quick reaction to changes in the NO concentration, a dehumidifier (23) and a measuring gas pump (20) are located in the connection line between the analyser and the ventilator. Preferably, an NO limit value monitoring unit (18) which acts upon the metering unit and is connected to the analyser, is provided. Furthermore, a monitoring and control unit (6b) advantageously adjusts the NO to be metered by determining the volume flows of respiration gas and NO with due consideration of the NO analysis value.

Apparatus for the monitored metering of NO into
patients' respiratory air, comprising


a) a respirator (1) with a connecting line (13)
leading from the respirator to the patient,
b) an NO metering container (3) which is connected
to the respirator (1),
c) a metering unit (4) arranged between respirator
(1) and NO meteri
ng container (3),
d) an analyser (2) connected to the connecting
line (13) leading from the respirator (1) to the

patient for determining the concentration of NO
in the patient's respiratory air,
e) a control unit (6a) which is connected to the
analyser (2) and acts on the metering unit (4),
f) a dehumidifier (23) located in the connecting
line between respirator (1) and analyser (2),

and
g) a measurement gas pump (20) located in the
connecting line between analyser (2) and

dehumidifier (23).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the dehumidifier (23) is a measurement gas

condenser.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the analyser (2) is designed as an

apparatus operating on the principle of the
measurement of infrared absorption or with

electrochemical sensors, or as chemiluminescence
detector (26).
Apparatus according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized by an NO limit monitoring unit (18)

which is connected to the analyser (2) and acts on
the control unit (6a). 
Apparatus according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the concentrations of NO

measured in the analyser (2) [lacuna] transmitted

to a control unit (6a) which adjusts, via a
metering unit (4), the amount of NO supplied to the

patient.
Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterized by devices for measuring the

inspiration volumetric flow of respiratory air and
oxygen, the NO volumetric flow, and a monitoring

and automatic control unit (6b) in which the
measured NO volumetric flow and the analysed value

is fed back as controlled variable for adjusting
the amount of NO metered in.
Apparatus according to any of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that a monitoring and automatic

control unit (6b) calculates, by measuring the
volumetric flow of respiratory air and oxygen and

on the basis of the concentration of NO which is
set, the required volumetric flow of NO to be

metered in.
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in
that a chemiluminescence detector (26) serves as

analyser (2) for determining the concentration of
NO and NO
2
 in the respiratory gas or exhaled gas.
Apparatus according to any of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that control valves (5) in the

line supplying NO are also clocked by a signal from
an inspiration valve (10) in the line of the

respiratory arm (16).
