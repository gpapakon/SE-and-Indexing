(e) exposing the carrier assembly (8) to radiant heat to preheat

(f) thereafter exposing the deposited solder paste to further heat 
to raise the solder paste to a second elevated temperature whereby to 

soften the solder paste; and 
(g) allowing the solder paste to cool or cooling the solder paste

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in or relating to methods
of mounting circuit components on flexible substrates and, in particular,
surface mounting components to the conductors of printed circuits on
flexible substrates having relatively low temperature resistance.One well known method of mounting circuit components on rigid
substrates in the manufacture of printed circuits is referred to as surface
mounting. In this method, the components are positioned in the desired
location on the surface of the printed circuit substrate and connected to the
conductors of the circuit by reflow soldering techniques which are well
known in the manufacture of printed circuits. In reflow soldering, the
printed circuit substrate and the components are exposed to relatively high
temperatures in order to activate the solder paste. It has also been
proposed to surface mount components on flexible printed circuit
substrates but, in so doing, care must be taken to ensure that the substrate
is sufficiently resistant to the reflow soldering temperatures. Many film
materials, including polyesters, have not been used satisfactorily for
surface mounting components because of inadequate heat resistance and
dimensional stability. In practice, only flexible circuit substrates of
polyimide film have been found to be suitable for surface mounting of
components, in view of the resistance of polyimide films to the
temperatures encountered in reflow soldering.Flexible printed circuit substrates are used extensively for some purposes,
usually where a rigid substrate cannot be easily accommodated in the
space available. One common use of flexible printed circuits is for
vehicle instrument clusters but these circuits have been relatively simple 
and have not required surface mounting of components.Most of these simple flexible printed circuits, especially for use in
automobile instrument clusters, have used flexible polyester film to
provide the flexible substrate. Flexible polyester films are much cheaper
than polyimide films, approximately one quarter or one fifth of the price
of polyimide films but polyester films have much lower softening points
than polyimide and, in general, are unstable at the temperatures
commonly found in reflow soldering.In US-A-5128506 there is described a method of mounting circuit
components to conductors of printed circuits on a substrate comprising the
following steps
(a) procuring a substrate having a surface carrying electrical
