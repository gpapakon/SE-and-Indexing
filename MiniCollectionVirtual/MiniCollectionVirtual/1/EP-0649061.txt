<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a positive electron beam
resist composition used for producing masks for photolithography and
semiconductor integrated circuits by using electron beam
lithography.Conventionally used positive electro beam resists are mainly
composed of a polymer such as polymethyl methacrylate, poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl
α-chloroacrylate) or poly(1-butenesulfone).
However, these resists are disadvantageously poor in dry etching
resistance. In recent years, dry-etching is increasingly used in
the production of photomasks and semiconductor integrated circuits,
and these conventional resists cannot be used satisfactorily
in more cases.On the contrary, positive photoresists mainly composed of a
novolak resin and a quinonediazide compound (e.g., Japanese Patent
Laid-Open (Kokai) Nos. 63-115162, 3-251845 and 4-12357) are
excellent in dry etching resistance and in addition, can be
developed by a non-swelling alkali aqueous solution, hence being
excellent in resolution and pattern form advantageously. However,
they are unpractically extremely low in sensitivity when used for
electron beam lithography. An object of the present invention is to present a positive
electron beam resist composition mainly composed of a novolak
resin and a quinonediazide compound, excellent in dry etching
resistance and resolution and high in sensitivity.Another object of the present invention is to present a
method for forming a fine pattern specifically high in
sensitivity, accurately rectangular in form and higher in
resolution by using the positive electron beam resist composition.The present invention provides a positive electron beam
resist composition mainly composed of a novolak and a
quinonediazide excellent in dry etching resistance and resolution,
and the composition can be used to obtain a fine pattern at high
sensitivity especially if a particular developer
is used.The inventors studied the resists mainly composed of a
novolak resin and a quinonediazide compound, and the processes for
them, and as a result, found that if a resist optimized in
material and composition is developed by a developer with a
specific composition, high sensitivity not achieved by applying
any of the conventional photoresists can be achieved.The positive electron beam resist composition of the present
invention comprises (1) a cresolnovolak resin, (2) at least one
additive selected from a group consisting of compounds represented
by the following general formulae (I) and (II):
