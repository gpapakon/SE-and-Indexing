<ABSTRACT>
A dermatological agent is disclosed for aiding the transport of oxygen in the skin, as well as a process for preparing the same and its use. The problem with the known dermatological agents is the insufficient oxygen supply to the skin and adjacent tissues. The object of the invention is thus to overcome the stratum corneum of the skin and the epiderm by penetration processes in order to increase the oxygen concentration in the corial zone and adjacent tissues and to activate the metabolic processes. For that purpose, a dermatological agent with asymmetrical lamellary aggregates consists of phospholipids and oxygen-loaded fluorocarbon or a fluorocarbon mixture. The proportion of fluorocarbon lies in a range from 0.2 to 100 % by weight/volume, in an excipient appropriate for dermatological uses. This dermatological agent is prepared by emulsifying its components and by using it in salves, creams, lotions, liquids, alcoholic extracts, pastes, powders, gels, tinctures or on plasters and bandages, or in a spray.

<CLAIMS>
Dermatological agent for assisting the transport 
of oxygen in the skin, characterised by asymmetric 

lamellar aggregates, consisting of 

(a) phospholipids having a phosphatidylcholine content of 
30 to 99 % by weight, and 
(b) oxygen-laden fluorocarbon or fluorocarbon mixture, 
the amount of fluorocarbon being in the range from 0.2 to 

100 % weight/volume, 
 
the aggregates having a skin penetration depending on the 

critical solubility temperature (in n-hexane) of the 
selected fluorocarbons or fluorocarbon mixtures, and 

being present in a carrier which is suitable for 
dermatological use. 
Dermatological agent according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the lamellar aggregates have an 

asymmetric, preferably three-layer, structure originating 
from their fluorocarbon core. 
Dermatological agent according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the fluorocarbons are selected from 

the group which consists of aliphatic straight-chain and 
branched fluoroalkanes, mono- or bicyclic, optionally 

fluoroalkyl-substituted, fluorocycloalkanes, perfluorinated 
aliphatic or bicyclic amines, bis(perfluoroalkyl)ethenes 

and mixtures thereof. 
Dermatological agent according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the fluorocarbons are selected from 

the group which consists of perfluorodecalin, F-butyltetrahydrofuran, 
perfluorotributylamine, perfluorooctyl 

bromide, bis-fluoro(butyl)ethene and C₆-C₉-perfluoroalkanes.  
 
Dermatological agent according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the amount of fluorocarbons 

is in the range from 20 to 100 % weight/volume, preferably 
in the range from 40 to 100 %, in particular in the 

range from 70 to 100 % weight/volume. 
Dermatological agent according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the phospholipids are selected from 

the group consisting of natural phospholipids such as 
soya lecithin and egg lecithin, synthetic phospholipids, 

hydrogenated lecithins and/or partially hydrogenated 
phospholipids, the concentration of the phospholipids 

being in the range from 0.5 to 20 %. 
Dermatological agent according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that phosphatidylcholine is present in 

an amount from 60 to 90 %. 
Dermatological agent according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that in the lipid fraction used, in 

addition to phosphatidylcholine, lysolecithins are 
present in the concentration range from 0.1 to 5 % by 

weight. 
Process for the preparation of a dermatological 
agent for assisting the transport of oxygen in the skin, 

characterised in that phospholipids having a phosphatidylcholine 
content of 30 to 99 % by weight are emulsified 

with an oxygen-laden fluorocarbon or fluorocarbon mixture, 
the amount of fluorocarbon being in the range from 

0.2 to 100 % weight/volume, and the asymmetric lamellar 
aggregates having a particle size from 50 to 1000 nm 

obtained in this way are incorporated into a carrier 
which is suitable for dermatological use. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterised in 
that the amount of fluorocarbons is in the range from 20 

to 100 % weight per volume, preferably in the range from 
40 to 100 % and the amount of phosphatidylcholine in the

content of 30 to 99 % by weight and fluorocarbons, 
the fluorocarbons being in the range from 0.2 to 

100 % weight/volume and the penetration into the skin

customary for dermatological use, such as ointments, 

creams, lotions, waters, alcoholic extracts, pastes, 
powder, gels and tinctures or the system being applied to 

a dressing or a plaster or being applied by means of a 
spray.
