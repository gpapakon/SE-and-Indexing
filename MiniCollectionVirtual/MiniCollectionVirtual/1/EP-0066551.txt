<ABSTRACT>
Parking device for dummy bars which can be employed 
in continuous casting machines with a roller-type casting line 

(13) stretching between the ingot mould (12) and the 
substantially horizontal outlet, said machines comprising an 

extraction and straightening group (17) located at said outlet, 
whereby said device includes:- a swinging parking structure 

(20) to park the dummy bar (11), said structure (20) being 
pivoted at one end upstream from said extraction and 

straightening group (17) and being able to rotate around a 
pivot (521) between a raised position of rest and a lowered 

working position: lifting means (21) able to move the free 
end (220) of said parking structure (20) between said position 

of rest and the working position: thrust means (33) anchored 
to said parking structure (20) and acting also as means to 

clamp the dummy bar (11) to said parking structure (20): 
whereby entraining means (18) are envisaged on the casting 

line (13) upstream from said parking structure and are able to 
draw the dummy bar (11) along the casting line, and 

whereby means (19) are also envisaged for detaching the 
head (111) of the dummy bar (11) from the billet (13).
