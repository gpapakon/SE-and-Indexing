<ABSTRACT>
A blood coagulation normalizer containing TCF-II, a glycoprotein produced by human fibroblasts, as the active ingredient. 
It is efficacious in treating blood coagulation anomaly, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, and 

thrombocytopenia caused by cisplatin administration by promoting the production of blood coagulation factors and increasing 
the number of thrombocytes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medicinal compositions for the
normalization of blood coagulation or treatment of abnormal
blood coagulation, comprising a glycoprotein produced by
human fibroblast cells, TCF-II (tumor cytotoxic factor-II),
more particularly agents for the treatment of disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome, increase of
platelet count and prevention of thrombocytopenia.Biologically active substances produced by human derived
fibroblast cells, for example, β-interferon as a tumor
cytotoxic factor, have been well known. Biologically active
substances produced by fibroblast cells other than β-interferon
such as a tumor cytotoxic glycoprotein called CBF
is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No.
146293 (1983). A tumor growth inhibitory factor (INF) with
molecular weight of 35,000-45,000, which is purified from
culture broth of fibroblasts derived from human tissue, is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 33120
(1986). Furthermore, a tumor necrosis factor-like substance 
which is purified from the culture broth of fibroblasts, a
fibroblast-derived necrosis factor, FNF, and a
physiologically active substance with cytotoxic activity,
which is produced by animal-derived fibroblasts and has a
molecular weight of 40,000 to 60,000 and an isoelectric
point of pH 5.0±0.5, are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open
Publication No. 1872 (1986) and Japanese Patent Laid-open
No. 103021 (1987), respectively. In addition, all the
primary amino acid sequence and cDNA encoding the amino acid
sequence of a tumor cytotoxic factor, which is obtained from
the culture broth of human-derived fibroblasts, with a
molecular weight of 36,000±1,000 and an isoelectric point
of pH 10.5 or higher are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open
No. 10988 (1989). The inventors have been
investigating antitumor substances derived from human
fibroblast cells and found a new antitumor protein, which is
different from antitumor proteins hitherto reported.
Furthermore, the inventors successfully cloned a cDNA
encoding the protein, determined its all the primary amino
acid sequence, and confirmed usefulness of the protein. The
new antitumor protein and its gene were disclosed in the
inventors' International Patent Publication No. 10651
(1990). The new antitumor protein was called as TCF-II.TCF-II has both potent antitumor activity and
proliferation stimulative activity for normal cells and is a
member of the HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) group.
