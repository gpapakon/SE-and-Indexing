<ABSTRACT>
Corrosion resistant metal, either platinum or MCrAlY is bonded to a corrosion sensitive metal (11) such as nickel based superalloys by coating the surface with the corrosion resistant metal particles (14) held in a binder (13) and covering this with a metalide generating tape (15). This is then heated to cause the formation of the metalide coating on the metal surface, which in turn, bonds the corrosion resistant metal to the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: METHOD FOR FORMING CORROSION RESISTANT COATING ON AN ALLOY SURFACEBackground of the InventionMetals such as stainless steel as well as nickel, cobalt,titanium and tungsten based superalloys are frequently coated with acorrosion resistant material. One such corrosion resistant coating is ametalide coating, in particular, nickel aluminide coating. One method ofapplying such a metalide coating is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,334,417.Platinum and MCrAIY wherein the M represents a nickel cobalt alloy alsoform corrosion resistant surfaces. These metals cannot be applied ascoatings using braze alloys. The melt suppressants in the braze alloypromote oxidation and corrosion and therefore are unsuitable for thisapplication. As such, these coatings are typically applied using a plasmaspray. The plasma spray apparatus is expensive and not particularlysuitable for small or localized repairs. 

Summary of the InventionAccordingly, it is an object of the present invention toprovide a method to form a platinum or MCrAIY coating onto a superalloysurface without the use of a plasma spray.Further, it is an object of the present invention to use ametalide coating to bond platinum or MCrAIY to the surface of asuperalloy. The platinum or MCrAIY coating is formed on the surface ofthe metal part by coating the surface of the metal part with particles ofplatinum or MCrAIY and subsequently forming a metalide coating on thesurface. Preferably the MCrAIY or platinum particles are held on thesurface of the metal part using a binder such as PTFE or acrylic. Themetalide coating is preferably applied by first forming a tape whichincludes metal such as aluminum, a halide carrier, metal oxide and abinder. The tape is placed over the coating of the corrosion resistantmetal particles and the part being coated is then heated to cause thealuminum to react with the halide to form a metal halide compound whichin turn will react with the metal surface, forming an aluminide coating.The aluminide coating bonds the corrosion resistant metal particles to thesurface of the part being coated.In an alternate embodiment of the present invention the corrosionresistant metal particles are simply blended with a binder such aspolytetrafluoroethylene and placed onto the surface of the part beingcoated and a metalide tape is then placed over the corrosion resistant 

metal particle tape. The part is then subjected to a heating cycle to formthe metalide coating to bond the corrosion resistant particles to thesurface of the part.In another alternate
