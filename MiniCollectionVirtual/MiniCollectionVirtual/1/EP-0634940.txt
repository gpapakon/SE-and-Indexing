<ABSTRACT>
A pressure monitor for directly measuring the pressure in a liquid in a catheter, comprising light emitting means (1), photo sensitive means (2), receiving the light from the light emitting means (1) and transforming the light received into electric signals, and between the light emitting and light receiving means (1 and 2) a space accommodating a measuring zone of the catheter in which the pressure is measured. The measuring zone may be a part of the catheter tubing (3) or a branch pipe (4) of said tubing (3), the free end of this branch pipe (4) being closed. The light transmitted through the measuring zone varies in accordance with the pressure in the catheter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pressure monitors and to be 
more specific to pressure monitors for measuring the pressure 
in a catheter. From WO 90/07942 it is known that the overall correct 
function of an infusion pump may be supervised by considering 
the course of the pressure in the outlet catheter during each 
pumping cycle. It is important that the actual pressure in the 
very catheter is measured and not just the resistance a piston 
exerts against movement. It is the object of the invention to provide a 
pressure monitor measuring the pressure in the catheter 
directly. This is obtained by a monitor 
and catheter according to claim 1, such a monitor 
comprising a light 
emitting device and a light measuring device placed opposite 
each other leaving a space for insertion of a measuring zone of 
the catheter between these parts, this measuring zone lying 
downstream of a possible output valve of a pump, and a computer 
circuit transforming the signals from the light measuring part 
into signals representative to the pressure. The light source may be one or more cooperating 
surface light emitting diodes jointly having a size 
corresponding to the size of the measuring zone. Correspondingly, the photo sensitive device may be 
formed by one or more photo cells working in parallel and 
jointly having a size corresponding to the size of the light 
emitting device. The measuring zone may be a part of the catheter 
tubing or may be an appendix to the catheter, this appendix 
forming a manometer tube. When the manometer tube solution is used, the light 
measuring device may appropriately be a linear array of 
mutually independent photocells, this array having a length 
corresponding to the length of the branch tube. With this 
embodiment of the light measuring part it can be measured to 
which extent the infusion liquid rises in the manometer tube. Catheters for infusion pumps may have the shape of a  
 
tubing forming the complete flow path for the liquid to be 
infused from a reservoir. The pumping function may be obtained 
by part of the catheter forming a part of a peristaltic pump or 
being provided with another sort of pumping unit. In the last 
mentioned case, the manometer tube may be provided in this 
pumping unit downstream of the outlet valve of this unit. 
Thereby it is possible to mould the pumping unit with the 
manometer tube to obtain a more precise manometer tube. The invention also comprises a catheter provided with 
a branch tube forming a manometer tube 
according to claim 8.
