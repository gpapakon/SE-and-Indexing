<CLAIMS>
Refrigerator (10) with a thermally insulating housing (11), which 
together with a door (12), which is arranged to be closable thereat, 

encloses a cooling chamber (14) cooled by an evaporator (15) and which at 
its base (16) displays a pedestal (13), which serves for the reception of 

appliance units, such as condenser, compressor or the like and into the 
pedestal space of which there projects a convexity (17), into which a 

container (18) for the reception of stock to be cooled is insertable, of 
the housing base (16), characterised thereby, that air guides (22) 

between the container walls (20) and the walls bounding the convexity 
(17) are formed by the container (18) inserted into the convexity (17), 

whereby the cooling air is capable of flushing around the container (18), 
and that a deposit plate (30), which is formed with closed walls and 

arranged to be withdrawable and with the aid of which a guide is formed 
for the cooling air towards the container (18) and away beyond its 

opening (19), is provided at a spacing above the opening (19) of the 
container (18). 
Refrigerator according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the 
convexity (17) is arranged in the proximity of the door (12). 
Refrigerator according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that 
the deposit plate (30) extends beyond the opening rims of the container 

(18), makes an entry of cooling air possible in the region of the rear 
wall of the cooling chamber (14)and is arranged upto the proximity of the 

door (12), whereby a guide for the cooling air is formed by the 
arrangement of the deposit plate (30) in the region behind the convexity 

(17) together with the base (16) of the housing (11) as well as also by 
way of the opening (19) of the container (18). 
Refrigerator according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby, that the deposit plate (30) is guided to be displaceable in 

guide strips (70) at the side walls of the cooling chamber (14).  
 
Refrigerator according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
thereby, that the deposit plate (30) is subdivided into at least two 

deposit plate portions transversely to its direction of displacement, 
wherein the deposit plate portion, which is arranged nearer to the door 

(12), covers at least the opening (19) of the container (18) inserted 
into the convexity (17) and is guided to be displaceable in the deposit 

plate portion (50), which is further away from the door (12) and together 
with the deposit plate portion (31) near to the door forms the deposit 

plate (30). 
Refrigerator according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that the 
displacement travel of the deposit plate (30) is limited by co-operation 

between abutments (56) arranged at the deposit plate (30) on the one hand 
and counterabutments (76) provided at the guide strips (70) on the other 

hand, wherein the limitation, which is preset by the co-operation between 
the abutments (56) and the counterabutments (76), of the extraction 

travel of the deposit plate (30) out of the cooling chamber (14) is 
cancellable by tilting of the deposit plate (30) and this is thus 

withdrawable from the guides of the guide strips (70). 
Refrigerator according to the claims 5 and 6, characterised thereby, 
that the abutments (56), which are arranged at the deposit plate (30), 

are arranged at the deposit plate portion remote from the door and - in 
co-operation with the counterabutments (76) at the guide strips (70) - 

produce an extraction path for the deposit plate (30) out of the cooling 
chamber (14), through which the deposit plate portion (50) remote from 

the door is displaceable into the region of the door opening. 
Refrigerator according to the claims 4 and 5, characterised thereby, 
that the deposit plate (30) displays a framelike surround (53), the 

portions of which extending parallelly to its direction of displacement 
are constructed as struts (54), which on the one hand are retained to be 

displaceable in the guide strips (70) and on the other hand - together 
with a web (62), which faces the door (12) and connects both the struts 

(54), and with the long side, which faces the door (12), of the 
deposit plate portion (50) remote from the door - bound a passage (66) which,  

 
in the case of positionally correct end position of the deposit plate 

(30) in the cooling chamber (14), frees at least the opening (19) of the 
container (18) inserted into the convexity (17) and is coverable by the 

deposit plate portion (31) near to the door. 
Refrigerator according to claim 8, characterised thereby, that the 
struts (54) on their side facing the passages (66) form guides for the 

deposit plate portion (31) near to the door, in which guides this portion 
is guided to be displaceable, wherein the displacement travel of the 

deposit plate portion (31) near to the door in direction of extraction 
from the cooling chamber (14) is limited by co-operation between the web 

(62) serving as abutment and arms (37), which serve as counterabutments, 
are arranged at the deposit plate portion (31) near to the door and by 

engaging below the struts (54) support these against tilting down in the 
extracted position. 
Refrigerator according to the claims 4 and 5, characterised thereby, 
that the deposit plate portion (50) remote from the door, which is guided 

to be displaceable in the guides of the guide strips (70), is retained in 
its intended position during the extraction process of the deposit plate 

portion (31) near to the door by dogs (79), which are arranged at the 
guide strips (70), obstruct the extraction movement of the deposit plate 

portion (50) remote from the door and co-operate with a slide-on ramp 
(58), for which the obstruction to the withdrawal of the deposit plate 

portion (50) remote from the door from the guide strips (70) is cancelled 
by tilting these. 
Refrigerator according to claim 8, characterised thereby, that the 
web (62) of the deposit plate portion (50) remote from the door at its 

end face facing the door (12) as well as also the long side, which faces 
the door (12) and serves as transverse strut (39), of the deposit plate 

portion (31) near to the door are provided with a handle (40, 64) 
permitting the engaging of fingers of a hand, wherein the handle (40) 

arranged at the transverse strut (39) of the deposit plate portion (31) 
near to the door at the same time also permits the access to the handle 

(64) at the web (62).  
 
Refrigerator according-to claim 5, characterised thereby, that the 
deposit plate portion (50) remote from the door is equipped at its long 

side, which faces the rear wall of the cooling chamber (14), with a side 
wall (52) raised above the deposit surface (52).

thereby, that the container (18) at the outward sides, which are remote 

from the container chamber, of its container walls (20) is provided with 
ribs (21), which are directed away from the container walls (20), whereby 

spacings, which form approximately uniform air guide channels (22), are 
produced between the walls of the convexity (17) and the container walls 

(20) when the container (18) is inserted into the convexity (17).
