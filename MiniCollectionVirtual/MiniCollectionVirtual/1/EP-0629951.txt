<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor integrated circuit device 
includes an external connection terminal (14) receiving 

a normal signal varying between a high potential and a 
low potential, and a test mode setting signal, an input 

circuit (15) which is connected to the external 
connection terminal and receives the normal signal via 

the external connection terminal, an n-channel field

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
semiconductor integrated circuit devices, and more 
particularly to a semiconductor integrated circuit 
device in which the test functions of a built-in test 
circuit are activated in response to a test mode 
setting signal, which is applied to an external 
connection terminal and is higher than a voltage 
applied thereto in a normal operation mode. Recently, semiconductor integrated circuit 
devices have been designed to have advanced functions 
and an increased integration density. It takes an 
extremely long time to test such semiconductor 
integrated circuit devices in order to detect defects 
introduced during the production process. Under the 
above circumstances, a semiconductor integrated circuit 
device with a built-in test circuit has been developed 
in which the test functions of a built-in test circuit 
are activated in response to a test mode setting 
signal, which is applied to an external connection 
terminal and is higher than a voltage applied thereto 
in a normal operation mode. Fig. 1 shows an essential feature of a 
semiconductor integrated circuit device 1 as described 
above. The semiconductor integrated circuit device 1 
includes an external connection terminal 2 to which a 
normal signal is applied in a normal operation mode. 
For example, the normal signal has a high potential 
level of 5 [V] and a low potential level of 0 [V]. In 
a test mode, a test mode setting signal higher than 5 
[V] is applied to the external connection terminal 2. The device 1 includes an input first-stage  
 
circuit 3, which receives the signal applied to the 
external connection terminal 2. The device 1 includes 
a test mode setting signal detecting circuit 4, which 
detects the test mode setting signal applied to the 
external connection terminal 2. The device 1 includes 
a test function activating signal generating circuit 5, 
which generates a test function activating signal when 
the test mode setting signal is detected by the test 
mode setting signal detecting circuit 4. The test mode setting signal detecting 
circuit 4 and the test function activating signal 
generating circuit 5 are configured as shown in Fig. 2. 
The detecting circuit 4 includes n-channel metal oxide 
semiconductor (hereinafter simply referred to as nMOS) 
transistors 6₁, 6₂, 6₃, ..., 6n-1 and 6n (n is an 
integer) and an nMOS transistor 7. The gate of the 
nMOS transistor 7 is connected to a VCC power supply 
line, which supplies a power supply voltage of, for 
example, 5 [V]. The
