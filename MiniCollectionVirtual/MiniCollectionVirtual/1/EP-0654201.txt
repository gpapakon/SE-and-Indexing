<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a process for improving radio reception on a road system consisting of individual traffic lanes intersecting at any  angle via a cellular mobile radio system which comprises a number of adjacent and mutually contacting or partially overlapping radio cells. In the boundary region of each cell there is at least one fixed transmitter with at least one sector aerial which covers at least part of a region of this cell to be supplied with radio frequencies of a channel group. At least one further fixed transmitter is arranged in the transition region with an immediately adjacent cell and at this post there is at least one sector aerial providing the cell to be supplied itself with the same channel group as the fixed transmitter, two or more fixed transmitters transmit simultaneously to a cell and the cells in a linear road structure have a star structure consisting of mutually overlapping ellipsoidal partial areas.

A method for the radio supply of a traffic route structure which consists of individual
traffic routes intersecting at any desired angle, by a cellular mobile radio system which

contains a number of radio cells which are adjacent and touching each other or
arranged partially overlapping, in which at least one fixed transmitter station (51-67) is

located in the marginal area of each cell with at least one sector antenna which sweeps
at least a partial zone (1-26) of the cell which is to be supplied, with radio frequencies of

a channel group (f1; f2), 
characterised in that
 at least one further fixed transmitter
station (51-67) is located in the area of transition to an immediately adjacent cell and 
in
that
 at this station at least one sector antenna is present which supplies this radio cell
with the same channel group (f1; f2) as, and at the same time as, the fixed transmitter

proper to the cell which is to be supplied.
A method according to Claim 
1, characterised in that
 at least one additional,
approximately omnidirectional antenna fed with the channel groups of the cell to be

supplied and of at least one adjacent cell is present at the further fixed transmitter
station.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at least as many
approximately omnidirectional antennae as there are adjacent cells to be supplied, each

of the antennae being fed with the channel group of the cell to be supplied by it, are
located at the further fixed transmitter station.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that
 the transmitters
associated with a cell are synchronised with each other. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that
 each channel in
each fixed station transmits with an individual power which can be regulated, the power

of each fixed station on this channel being set in a specific relation to the contribution of
the transmission power of this fixed station at the receiver input of the mobile station.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that
 each channel in
each fixed station transmits with an individual power which can be regulated, the power

of each fixed station on this channel being set in a specific relation to the received
power of the mobile station at the receiver input of this fixed station.
A method according to Claim 
5, characterised in that
 the transmission powers of the
fixed stations are set so that their total power at the receiver input of the mobile station

lies just above the minimum tolerable signal-interference interval for a defined
transmission quality with fading.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the transmissions
of a mobile station are received by the fixed station of the cell in which the mobile station

is situated and by the fixed stations of the adjoining cells and 
in that
 a balancing of
transmission powers takes place among these fixed stations such that the fixed stations

which are closest to the mobile station transmit with a specific power, whilst the fixed
stations which are remote from the mobile station transmit with a smaller portion than the

specific power or are switched off entirely.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the transmissions
of a mobile station are received by the fixed station of the cell in which the mobile station 

is situated and by the fixed stations of the adjoining cells and 
in that
 these received
signals undergo diversity combining to improve their quality.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 handover of a
mobile station in the connected state from one sector of the cell to an adjacent sector of

this cell is effected through an adaptive power allocation to the fixed stations covering
the cell.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 handover of a
mobile station in the connected state from one cell to an adjacent cell is effected by a

change of channel, such that only one of the fixed stations is involved at any given time,
the handover taking place in a local area which is predominantly covered by the

approximately omnidirectional antenna(e).
A device for the radio supply of a traffic route structure which consists of individual
traffic routes intersecting at any desired angle, by a cellular mobile radio system which

contains a number of radio cells which are adjacent and touching each other or
arranged partially overlapping, in which at least one fixed transmitter station (51-67) is

located in the marginal area of each cell with at least one sector antenna which sweeps
at least a partial zone of this cell which is to be supplied, with radio frequencies of a

channel group, 
characterised in that
 at least one further fixed transmitter station
(51-67) is located in the area of transition to an immediately adjacent cell and 
in that
 a
plurality of sector antennae are present at this station, each sector antenna pointing in

the direction of the centre of the individual cell which is to be supplied and supplying this
cell with the same radio channel group as the fixed transmitter proper to the cell which is

to be supplied, 
in that
 two or more fixed transmitters transmit to a cell simultaneously 
and 
in that
 the cells in a linear traffic route structure have a star-shaped structure which
is made up of overlapping elliptical partial areas (1-26).
A device according to Claim 12, 
characterised in that
 the transmission power of
each channel in each fixed station is adjustable as a function of the received power of

the mobile station at the receiver input of this fixed station and is adjusted in relation to
the respective transmission power of this mobile station.
A device according to one of Claims 12 or 13, 
characterised in that
 each fixed
station transmits with only a fraction of the power which would be necessary to supply

the entire cell with transmission power.
A method for the radio supply of a traffic route structure which consists of individual

contains a number of radio cells, adjacent and touching each other or arranged partially
overlapping, each radio cell being supplied with radio frequencies of a channel group,


characterised in that
 for the radio supply of the traffic route structure, the radio cells
are arranged so that they each provide radio coverage to parts of the traffic route

structure so that each area of coverage is formed as an n-radiate substructure (1-26)

route structure is situated within a radio cell, and

a cell transmit simultaneously.
