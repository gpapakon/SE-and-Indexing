<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory and its production process, and more particularly, the
invention relates to a semiconductor memory provided with a
memory transistor having a charge storage layer and a control
gate, and its production process.As a memory cell of an EEPROM, is known a device of
a MOS transistor structure having a charge storage layer and a
control gate in a gate portion, in which an electric charge is
injected into and released from the charge storage layer by use
of a tunnel current. In this memory cell, data "0" and "1" is
stored as changes in a threshold voltage by the state of the
charge in the charge storage layer. For example, in the case
of an n-channel memory cell using a floating gate as the charge
storage layer, when a source/drain diffusion layer and a
substrate are grounded and a high positive voltage is applied
to the control gate, electrons are injected from the substrate
into the floating gate by a tunnel current. This injection of 
electrons shifts the threshold voltage of the memory cell
toward positive. When the control gate is grounded and a
high positive voltage is applied to the source/drain diffusion
layer or the substrate, electrons are released from the floating
gate to the substrate by the tunnel current. This release of
electrons shifts the threshold voltage of the memory cell
toward negative.In the above-described operation, a relationship of
capacity coupling between the floating gate and the control
gate with capacity coupling between the floating agate and the
substrate plays an important role in effective injection and
release of electrons, i.e., effective writing and erasure. That is,
the larger the capacity between the floating gate and the
control gate, the more effectively the potential of the control
gate can be transmitted to the floating gate and the easier the
writing and erasure become.With recent development in semiconductor technology,
especially, in micro-patterning techniques, the size reduction
and the capacity increase of memory cells of EEPROM are
rapidly progressing. Accordingly, it is an important how large
capacity can be ensured between the floating gate and the
control gate.For increasing the capacity between the floating gate
and the control gate, it is necessary to thin a gate insulating
film therebetween, to increase the dielectric constant of the
gate insulating film or to enlarge an area where the floating
gate opposes the control gate.However, the thinning of the gate insulating film is 
limited in view of
