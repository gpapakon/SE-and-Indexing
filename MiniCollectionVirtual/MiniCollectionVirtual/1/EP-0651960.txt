<ABSTRACT>
A clothes hanger to be used but a few times, which 
is made as an integral piece of compressed wood-fibre material 

and which comprises a body portion (1) to support 
a garment, and a hook portion (2) for suspending the 

hanger. The clothes hanger is characterised in that the 
body portion (1) and the hook portion (2) are designed as 

an open shell, such that the hanger is substantially completely 
nestable in a correspondingly-shaped clothes 

hanger.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clothes hanger and more 
specifically to a clothes hanger of the type recited in 
the preamble to appended claim 1. Clothes are today stored in shops either folded up 
on shelves or carried on clothes hangers. The latter option 
is the commoner since customers generally demand 
that the clothes should be easily accessible and easy to 
try on, prior to a purchase decision. The clothes are carried on hangers which are more or 
less conformed to the garments concerned. The hanger body is often made of wood or plastics, 
and has a metal hook. There are also other solutions 
according to which the entire hanger is made of plastics, 
wood or some metal. For reasons of economy, many shops selling clothes, 
especially large ones, only use plastic hangers. These 
also tend to an increasing extent to be hangers to be 
used only once or but a few times. The handling of such 
disposal plastic hangers thus is a problem today. Since 
the hangers are made of plastics, complicated equipment 
is required if, in compliance with today's recycling 
aims, it should be possible to recover the used plastic 
for producing other objects or new hangers. Another problem linked with this type of hanger, as 
well as with wooden hangers, is that the handling and 
transport of the hangers requires much space and therefore 
is costly. This is due to the special shape of the 
hanger, making it difficult to pack or store efficiently, 
especially as the hangers are easily entangled with each 
other. One object of the invention therefore is to provide 
a hanger which is easy to recover and therefore easy to 
recycle to the original producer.  Another object is to provide a hanger which, during 
storage, handling and transport, requires less room than 
previously known hangers. A special object of the invention is to provide a 
clothes hanger carrying the garments in an aesthetically 
appealing way. These objects are achieved by means of a clothes 
hanger of the above-mentioned type having the features 
recited in claim 1. Preferred embodiments of the invention are recited 
in the appended subclaims. A currently preferred embodiment will be described 
hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, 
in which 
Fig. 1 is a side view of a clothes hanger according 
to the invention, Fig. 2 is a section taken along line I-I in Fig. 1, 
and Fig. 3 is a section taken along line II-II in Fig. 
1. Fig. 1 shows a clothes hanger according to the invention, 
which is made as an integral piece and has a 
body
