<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to arc hardfacing
rods. More particularly this invention relates to arc
hardfacing rods which are useful for depositing hard
carbide particles on a base material to produce cutting
and/or wearing surfaces and a method of making the arc
hardfacing rods.Hardfacing rods are widely used for applying
a hard surface, also known as a hardfacing, to a base
material to protect the base material from abrasive
wear and/or to provide a cutting surface thereon.
These base materials are typically of a metal material
and may be in the form of tools such as hand and power
shovels, cutting tools, hammers, agricultural tools,
down hole drill bits, etc.A widely used type of such hardfacing rod
incorporates hard particles, such as refractory
carbides within a tubular metal rod. The hard
particles are deposited from the hardfacing rods by
thermal diffusion through the use of a high temperature
gas flame, an electric arc, or a similar source of
heat. Depending on the source of heat, the tube is
characterized as a welding rod or as both a welding rod
and an electrode. (For example, gas flame and electric
arc, respectively.)It will be appreciated that it is generally
advantageous to minimize the amount of carbide 
particles dissolved in the weld pool and to suspend the
carbide particles uniformly in the weld pool. Carbide
particles that are undissolved and uniformly dispersed
in the weld pool better perform their intended function
of cutting and/or resisting abrasion. Accordingly,
hardfacing rods should deposit as high a carbide
content as possible to produce long wearing and/or
cutting surfaces.Various types of hardfacing rods are known.
U. S. Patent 2,280,223 discloses a coated hardfacing
rod having a core of a hard alloy metal. The hard
alloy metal core may be a high carbon containing cobalt
and chromium or tungsten or both which may contain
additions of nickel, molybdenum, tantalum, titanium,
iron and cesium. The coating contains metal carbides.
U. S. Patent 2,507,195 discloses a hardfacing rod
including an austenitic manganese steel in combination
with carbide particles. The carbide particles may be
formed as a coating and/or core on or in the rod. The
austenitic manganese steel is added for its toughness
and cold work properties. U. S. Patent 3,023,130
discloses either a hardfacing rod of a stainless steel
matrix composition having carbide particles within a
flux coating on the outside of a rod or carbide
particles within a flux coating within the rod. US-A-3,592,999 discloses a welding electrode
