<DESCRIPTION>
Weeds cost farmers billions of dollars annually in crop losses and in the
expense of keeping weeds under control. Much of the cost of intertillage of row
crops, maintenance of fallow, seedbed preparation, and seed cleaning is chargeable
to weed control. Suppression of weeds along highways and railroad right-of-ways,
and in irrigation ditches, navigation channels, yards, parks, grounds, and home
gardens also is expensive. Ragweed pollen is the source of annual periodic distress
to several million hayfever sufferers. Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, nettles,
thistles, sandburs, and puncturevine also bring pain to millions. Weeds also serve
as hosts for other crop diseases as well as for insect pests.The losses caused by weeds in agricultural production environments include
decrease in crop yield, reduced crop quality, increased irrigation costs, increased
harvesting costs, decreased land value, injury to livestock, and crop damage from
insects and diseases harbored by the weeds.Chemical herbicides have provided an effective method of weed control;
however, the public has become concerned about the amount of residual chemicals
which might be found in food, ground water, and the environment. Stringent new
restrictions on the use of herbicides and the elimination of some effective
herbicides from the market place could limit economical and effective options for
controlling costly weeds. Additionally, the visually apparent phytotoxic effects of
some systemic herbicides appear very slowly on the target weeds, so pesticide users
often seek methods by which the apparent speed of action of the herbicide is
increased.There is a great need for novel weed control methods which reduce the
amount of chemical herbicide necessary to obtain acceptable levels of weed 
control. Researchers have experimented with various combinations of chemicals
as one approach to identify compositions which have desirable herbicidal
characteristics. In the rare instance, unexpected activity of the combination of
chemicals is obtained. For example, selective control of annual weeds with a
composition of fatty acids mixed with ethylmaleimide, colchicine, 2,4-dinitrohalobenzene,
or 2,4-dinitrophenol has been described in the Japanese patent
abstract JP61106501. It should be noted that the compounds which were mixed
with the fatty acids are not known for their agricultural use and, in fact, may be
inappropriate for many herbicidal applications. Other abstracts disclosing a variety
