<ABSTRACT>
In an information reproducing method, directory 
data for managing file data is recorded on an 

information recording medium to manage recording 
reproduction of the file data. There are provided a 

defect bit map in which defect information indicating 
if a defect exists or not corresponding to each 

physical address of the recording medium is recorded on 
the recording medium, and a defect index table on which 

the number of defects in a block is recorded every 
predetermined bl
ock of the defect bit map. When a 
designated logical address is converted into a physical 

address, searching is sequentially performed on a block 
on the defect index table where the designated logical 

address exists and a physical address in the searched 
block on the defect bit map.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
reproducing method of and apparatus for reproducing information
recorded on a recording medium such as an optical card.Conventionally, as a write once information
recording medium, an optical disk or card for optically
recording information is known. When data is
recorded/reproduced on/from such a recording medium,
the data is generally managed for each file. For
management of this file data, auxiliary data, i.e., a
so-called directory is used. Normally, as directory
information, file information such as a file name, a
file length, a start track and the like is recorded in
part of the recording medium. If a defect is caused in
part of the recording medium to form an inaccessible
region, an alternation process is performed as relief
to record the same information on an region (to be
referred to as an alternative region hereinafter) in
place of the defect region. Such an information
recording method is proposed in, for example, Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Application No. 61-243994, in which
defect information is recorded with directory
information.However, in the above method, if a large number of
tracks with recording errors exist in one file, all 
error track numbers cannot always be recorded in one
directory to impede the management of the file data.The present inventor has previously filed an
information recording method in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 5-250812 which solves the
above problem. This method will be described below.
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the arrangement of an
information recording/reproducing apparatus used for
the above information recording method. Referring to
Fig. 1, a recording/reproducing apparatus 31 (to be
referred to as a drive hereinafter) records/reproduces
information on/from a write once optical card 1 serving
as an information recording medium. The drive 31 is
connected to a host computer 32 serving as a host
controller, and records/reproduces information on the
basis of an instruction from the host computer 32. A
motor 37 loads the optical card 1 into the drive 31 by
a conveying mechanism (not shown), causes the card 1 to
move back and forth in an R direction by a
predetermined drive, and removes the card 1 from the
apparatus. A light beam radiating optical system 38
includes a light source and scans a light beam spot on
the optical card 1 in recording/reproducing
information. A photodetector 39 receives the light of
the light beam spot reflected by the optical card 1.An AF actuator 40 drives part of the

<CLAIMS>
An information reproducing method for an information
recording medium which is divided into predetermined

blocks of consecutive physical addresses and storing file
data at said physical addresses and directory data for

managing the file data, comprising the steps of:

determining from the recording medium for each
physical address whether the address is defective and

generating a map of defect physical addresses;
preparing an index table storing for each
predetermined block the total number of defect addresses;
searching a block where a desired logical address
exists on the basis of the physical defect index table;

and
searching a physical address corresponding to the
desired logical address in the searched block on the map

of defect physical addresses.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said physical
defect bit map preparing step comprises the step of

storing defect information in the defect bit map by
causing one physical address of the information recording

medium to correspond to one bit.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, further
comprising the step of setting the number of blocks m on 

the defect index table and the number of physical
addresses of one block on the defect bit map to Tbxn Tixm

such that the time required to search the physical
address is minimized, where Tb is a unit search time of

the defect bit map, and Ti is a unit search time of the
defect index table.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
further comprising the step of renewing the defect

information of the defect bit map and the defect index
table whenever a defect is detected in recording data.
Apparatus for carrying out the method as claimed in
claim 1 for reproducing information from a recording

medium which is divided into predetermined blocks of
consecutive physical addresses and storing file data at

said physical addresses and directory data for managing
the file data, the apparatus comprising:


means (33) for determining from the recording medium
for each physical address whether the address is

defective and generating a map of defect physical
addresses;
means (33) for preparing an index table storing for
each predetermined block the total number of defect

addresses; and
means (33) for searching a block where a desired
logical address exists on the basis of the physical 

defect index table, and for searching a physical address
corresponding to the desired logical address in the

searched block on the map of defect physical addresses.
Apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said means
for generating the map of defect of physical addresses

comprises means adapted to store defect information in
the defect bit map by causing one physical address of the

information recording medium to correspond to one bit.
