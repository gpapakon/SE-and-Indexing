<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an adaptor for mounting a gas pressure sensor to
a wall of a housing of a high temperature system, such as a gas turbine or a
chemical reactor, for example plug flow reactor, according to the preamble part of claim 1.Gas turbines are used for driving airplanes, ships or large vehicles and
as part of power plants. In both cases the reliability of the gas turbines is an
extremely important factor. In order to improve the operating reliability and,
thus, to prevent or reduce costly and dangerous break downs, a diagnosis of the
engine in intervals or in on-line monitoring is of crucial importance. The static
and/or dynamic pressure in the various stages of the gas turbine is an
important parameter to be observed for diagnosis and for monitoring the
functioning of the gas turbine. From ASME paper no. 90-Gt-341 it is known to
carry out pressure measurements with a pressure sensor attached to the
turbine wall. Also in case of chemical reactors, the observation of dynamic
pressure variations is important for controlling the process.The temperature range in which the pressure sensor is to be used in
connection with the high temperature systems, goes up to relatively high
temperatures. In a high pressure compressor, for example, the rear stages may
exhibit temperatures of up to 600 °C with a correspondingly high wall
temperature. However, the maximum operating temperature of commercially
available pressure sensors, especially dynamic pressure sensors, is well below
this temperature value (for example 200°C in case of the Kistler pressure
sensor, type 6031).An adaptor according to the preamble part of claim 1 is known from
US-A-4,364,266. This known adaptor comprises a carrier and a hollow tube
means extending through the carrier. The hollow tube means provides a fluid
communication between the internal space of an engine to be monitored and
the pressure sensor used for monitoring the engine. At the end remote from
the engine, the hollow tube means is secured to a fitting providing an internal
opening into which the sensor head of the pressure sensor can be mounted. From US-A-4,058,015 there is known an adaptor in which a first tube
portion at one end thereof is in communication with a space to be measured
and a second end thereof opens into an inner space of the adaptor. This space
is partly filled with a liquid. The amount of liquid contained in the inner space
of the adaptor is such that the liquid is prevented from entering the free end
of the first tube portion. A second tube portion
