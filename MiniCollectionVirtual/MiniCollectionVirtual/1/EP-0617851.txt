<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a socket (1) which forms part of a flat-pin connector designed for 19" racks. Mounted on it by means of soldering tabs (3) is a standard circuit board (2) which is fitted in a housing (9). The housing (9) has two parallel walls (13, 14) and is closed off from the socket by a half-frame (16). The part of the socket (1) facing towards the circuit board (2) has a central section (6) which not only carries the soldering tabs (3) but also acts as a stop for the circuit board (2). The dimensions and position of this central section (6) are such that the housing wall (13) which covers the solder side of the circuit board does not extend out more than a distance R

- defined by the distance between the pin array and the side of the socket (1), so that the whole of the rest of the width comprising n

- distances R

- is available for components and the other wall (14). The space available for components can be further increased by providing over the shoulder (10) as recess (12) which allows the circuit board (2) to be mechanically fixed in place by means of rivets or bolts passing through a hole (11).

<CLAIMS>
A male multipoint connector for installation in 19-inch 
module frames, bearing on the one side - the contact 

side - fifteen blade contacts (7) by means of which it can 
be plugged into a female multipoint connector of 

corresponding shape, the said male multipoint connector 
bearing on the other side - the printed-circuit board side 

- fifteen solder pins (3) onto which a printed-circuit 
board (2), for example with a metal plate as a screen, can 

be soldered, wherein the male multipoint connector conforms 
to the H design of DIN 41 612 in its width dimension 

transversely to the blade contacts (7), its longitudinal 
dimension in the direction of the row of blade contacts 

(7), and in the shape and dimensional arrangement of the 
side with which it can be connected with the female 

multipoint connector, wherein the male multipoint connector 
is further provided with a central part (6) on the printed-circuit 

board side which contains fifteen connecting lugs 
(8) and serving on one of its flanks as a stop for the 

printed-circuit board (2), the said connecting lugs (8) 
bearing the blade contacts (7) on one side and the soldered 

pins (3) on their other side, characterised in that the 
distance between the edge of the male multipoint connector 

and the flank of the central part (6) serving as a stop for 
the printed-circuit board (2) is chosen such that it 

corresponds to the sum of the thickness of one printed-circuit 
board (2), the length of the soldering post 

projection according to DIN 41 494, the tolerance value 
T
 
according to DIN 41 494 and the thickness of one metal 

plate. 
A male multipoint connector according to claim 1 
characterised in that the metal plate is a screening plate 

(5). 
A male multipoint connector according to claim 1 
characterised in that the metal plate is the wall (13) of 

a metal casing (9).  
 
A male multipoint connector according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the solder pins (3) are arranged in 

two rows displaced relative to each other in respect of 
their distance from the blade contacts (7). 
A male multipoint connector according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the distance of the solder pins from 

the blade contacts (7) is less than in the standard.
