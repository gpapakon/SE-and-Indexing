<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor control 
device for controlling a control object, that is, a 
motor, such that the operation speed reaches a target 
value, and more specifically to a motor vibration 
control device for suppressing the torsional vibration 
in controlling the operation speed. Setting a motor at a predetermined operation speed 
can be performed by detecting the actual operation 
speed of the motor and controlling the electric power 
provided for the motor based on the difference between 
the predetermined operation speed and the detected 
operation speed. However, since the phase of the loop transfer 
function of a control system is delayed, the torsional 
vibration can be generated at a loaded equipment 
connected to the shaft of a motor. Figure 1 is a block diagram showing the 
configuration of the conventional vibration control  
 
device of a motor. In Figure 1, a motor 105 is equipped with a 
control device 100, a power converting device 103, a 
current detecting unit 104, a speed detecting unit 
106, etc. It transfers the power to a loaded 
equipment 107 by driving the motor 105 by an output 
from the control device 100 at a variable speed 
through the power converting device 103. In this 
configuration, the control device 100 is equipped with 
a speed adjusting unit 101, a current adjusting unit 
102, an observer (state observing unit) 109 for 
estimating the speed and the shaft torque of the 
loaded equipment system, a weight adding unit 110, and a 
torque calculating unit 108 for calculating a driving torque 
according to a current value from the current 
adjusting unit 102. The speed adjusting unit 101 outputs a driving 
torque reference τa* to set to 0 the difference 
between a speed reference ωM* and the actual operation 
speed ωM of the motor 105 output by the speed 
detecting unit 106. The driving torque reference τa* 
is output as a current value, added by an adding unit 111 
to the current value output by the weight adder 110, 
and input to the current adjusting unit 102. The 
current adjusting unit 102 controls the electric  
 
current such that the difference between the current 
value obtained by the above mentioned addition and the 
current value Id detected by the current detecting 
unit 104 and actually input to the motor 105 can be 
set to 0. It outputs a power converting unit control 
signal Cp to the power converting device 103. The power 
converting device 103 provides an electric power for the 
motor 105 according to the power converting unit 
control
