<ABSTRACT>
In the transmitter side, 
data are divided into two or more groups, according to importance. In a 

three groups system, for example, the data streams are then mapped onto 
a multiresolution constellation (QAM or modified PSK) in the following 

way. The most important data determine the quadrant, the next most 
important determine which of four subsets is used in the quadrant, and 

the least important determine which point is used within that subset. 
This mapping system allows receivers of differing capabilities to detect 

as much data as they are able, or a single receiver to detect as much 
data as the channel quality allows. For example, a QPSK receiver could 

detect the most important data, a modified 16QAM receiver could detect 
the most important and second most important data, while a modified 

64QAM receiver could receive all the data. 
Furthermore, in an OFDM system, multiresolution transmission is 
provided by using long guard times and/or wider channel spacing 

(equivalently, longer symbols) for the more important data. A system 
using n-level VSB is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication system 
for transmission/reception of a digital signal through 
modulation of its carrier wave and demodulation of the 
modulated signal. Digital signal communication systems have been used in 
various fields. Particularly, digital video signal 
transmission techniques have been improved remarkably. Among them is a digital TV signal transmission method. 
So far, such digital TV signal transmission system are in 
particular use for e.g. transmission between TV stations. 
They will soon be utilized for terrestrial and/or satellite 
broadcast service in every country of the world. The TV broadcast systems including HDTV, PCM music, FAX, 
and other information service are now demanded to increase 
desired data in quantity and quality for satisfying millions 
of sophisticated viewers. In particular, the data has to be 
increased in a given bandwidth of frequency allocated for TV 
broadcast service. The data to be transmitted is always 
abundant and provided as much as handled with up-to-date 
techniques of the time. It is ideal to modify or change the 
existing signal transmission system corresponding to an  
 
increase in the data amount with time. However, the TV broadcast service is a public business 
and cannot go further without considering the interests and 
benefits of viewers. It is essential to have any new service 
appreciable with existing TV receivers and displays. More 
particularly, the compatibility of a system is much desired 
for providing both old and new services simultaneously or one 
new service which can be intercepted by either of the 
existing and advanced receivers. It is understood that any new digital TV broadcast 
system to be introduced has to be arranged for data extension 
in order to respond to future demands and technological 
advantages and also, for compatible action to allow the 
existing receivers to receive transmissions. The expansion capability and compatible performance of 
prior art digital TV system will be explained. A digital satellite TV system is known in which NTSC TV 
signals compressed to an about 6 Mbps are multiplexed by time 
division modulation of 4 PSK and transmitted on 4 to 20 
channels while HDTV signals are carried on a single channel. 
Another digital HDTV system is provided in which HDTV video 
data compressed to as small as 15 Mbps are transmitted on a 
16 or 32 QAM signal through ground stations. Such a known satellite system permits HDTV signals to be 
carried on one channel by a conventional
