<ABSTRACT>
A child safety seat can be used as an auxiliary seat in 
an automobile and a stroller. The child safety seat has 

front and rear caster arms (40,44) which are rotatably 
provided in a seat structure. The front and rear caster 

arms selectively extend downwardly from and retract above 
the lowermost portion of the seat structure. The child 

safety seat can be attached to the automobile seat when 
the front and rear caster arms retract.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to child safety seats, and more 
particularly to child safety seats that function both as an 
auxiliary automobile safety seat and as a stroller. In general, regular automobile seats and seat belts are 
designed for adults. Consequently, when a baby or a small 
child is placed directly on regular automobile seat, the 
seat belts typically will not safely support or secure the 
child to the automobile seat. To correct this problem, 
auxiliary child safety seats affix directly to the seat by 
means of the automobile's seat belt. A small child is then 
placed in the safety seat to be secured thereto by a safety 
belt incorporated in the safety seat. The child safety seat 
will in this way support the child's posture as well as 
safely secure the child to the automobile seat. Due to the wide spread use of automobiles in today's. 
increasingly mobile society, parents of small a child often 
find themselves constantly placing their child in and out the 
auxiliary safety seat. This task is further burdened by  
 
transferring the child to a stroller. Although a stroller 
facilitates their mobility with a child outside the 
automobile, the parent must transport the stroller in the 
automobile. Moreover, a stroller takes up a significant 
amount of available interior storage space in today's compact 
automobiles, and unfortunately reduces the trunk space for 
other baggage. In the past, one proposed solution to this problem included 
an auxiliary child safety seat having the combined function 
of a safety seat and a stroller. The parent can selectively 
use the combined seat either as an auxiliary safety seat 
securable to the automobile seat or as a stroller capable of 
transporting the child outside the automobile on a sidewalk 
or other hard surface. Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication No. 4-232175, for example, discloses a child seat 
which can be converted into a stroller or an auxiliary safety 
seat by operating a clamping member attached to a seat's 
shell while pulling up on a hand held stem. The lower 
portion of the safety seat houses the front and rear wheels 
of the stroller, allowing the safety seat to be attached to 
the automobile seat. This past design, however, increased the height of the 
auxiliary safety seat at least by the front and rear wheels. 
Such an increase in height is undesirable for the low 
headroom space in many of today's compact cars. When the  
 
auxiliary seat is placed on the automobile seat in the 
compact cars, the automobile's ceiling
