<ABSTRACT>
A container for holding a stack of tablets comprises a 
tablet tube (1) provided with a tamper-proof closure. The 

tablet tube is made of a flexible plastic material, has a 
substantially flat bottom (2) and, at its other open end, 

is provided with external threads (4). Spaced from these 
treads (4) in direction of the closed end, seal rupturing 

means (5) and seal retaining means (6) are arranged. The 
tamper-proof closure made of a flexible plastic material 

comprises a cap portion (11) with interior threads (13) and 
a substantially annular seal portion (9) joined to the rim 

of the cap portion (11). When the seal (9) is broken by 
first opening of the container, the seal portion (9) is 

displaced along the container wall and retained by the seal 
retaining means (6), whereby a clear indication is obtained 

that the closure originally was of a sealed type and that 
the seal (9) had been broken.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tablet tube for holding 
tablets in stacked position provided with a tamper-proof 
closure. Tablets for medical and similar use are packaged and dispensed 
in various types of containers. For certain applications, 
particularly such relating to tablets, particularly 
of tablets of larger than average size, the preferred 
package form is a tube with a bottom at its one end made in 
aluminum or similar material, the inner diameter of which 
is slightly larger than the larger diameter of the tablet. 
This provides for a stacking arrangement of the tablets in 
the container which protects the tablets, particularly 
fragile and/or large size tablets, from mechanical disintegration 
during filling, transport and handling. This 
stacking arrangement also has the advantage that the 
tablets are quite easily dispensed from the container tube 
one-by-one. This makes such containers particularly attractive 
for use by elderly or handicapped persons. A drawback with these tubiform containers is that they are 
easily permanently deformed when only partially filled. The 
reason is that, in a fully filled state, the tablets themselves 
support the tube walls against radial compression. 
Emptying of the container removes this support. Since 
aluminum is only moderatly resilient, deformation of the 
thin-walled unsupported upper part of a partially filled 
tube often exceeds the resilient deformation maximum of 
this material. The resulting permanent deformation traps 
the remaining tablets within the tube and makes them useless. For a long time aluminum has been the material of choice 
for such applications. One reason is that its walls are an 
absolute barrier to humidity and carbon dioxide which may 
reduce the shelf life of the contents. Another is that it 
is especially suited for forming such tubes with high  
 
precision, and that the tubes keep their precise form at 
small external loads which provides the user with a feel of 
stability and, thus quality, but at the cost of functionality. Because of the combination of two materials with entirely 
different properties - a polymer material for the cap and 
aluminium for the container tube - the provision of other 
desirable features has met with difficulty. Such desirable 
features include tamper-proof closures whose sealing condition 
is obvious to the user at a first glance. The object of the present invention is to provide a tubiform 
container/closure assembly for holding a stack of 
tablets which is lacking the disadvantages
