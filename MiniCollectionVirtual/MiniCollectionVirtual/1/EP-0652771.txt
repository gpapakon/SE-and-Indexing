<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
preparation of tetanus toxin for use in tetanus vaccines.The existing tetanus vaccine is produced from a 7-day
bottle culture of Clostridiumtetani which is
inactivated ("toxoided") by the addition for
formaldehyde. The formaldehyde is added as formalin.
Toxoid is purified for use in a vaccine by salt
fractionation to a specific activity of approximately
1200 flocculation units (Limes flocculationis, Lf)/mg
protein nitrogen (PN), which is equivalent to 30% to 40%
purity.Attempts have been made to increase the specific
activity of the vaccine by purifying the toxoid using
immunoadsorbents (Hughes etal, J. Appl. Bact. 37, 603-621,
1974). This however only resulted in a limited
increase, to 1600 Lf/mg PN. Dawson & Mauritzen (Aust J.
Biol Sci, 1969 vol 22, pp 1217) discloses studies on the
interaction of formaldehyde with tetanus toxin including
the binding of formaldehyde in the presence of the amino
acids leucine and lysine during the detoxification of
tetanus toxin. Bacterial Vaccines (Ed. R. Germanier,
Academic Press 1984, pp 48-50) discloses methods which
are used in the detoxification of tetanus toxin for use
in vaccines, and especially human vaccines. WO-A-91/12020
discloses a novel detoxified toxic antigen,
especially B. pertussis toxin, obtained by partial
detoxification using glutaraldehyde followed by reacting
the partially detoxified antigen with formalin in the
presence of selected amino acids. The detoxified B.
pertussis toxin is said to be stable against reversion to
toxicity. GB-A-969772 discloses a method for producing a
toxoid from a purified bacterial toxin, especially
purified diphtheria toxin, by treating the toxin in an
aqueous medium with formaldehyde in the presence of an 
aliphatic diamine of molecular weight below 200 which
contains a primary or secondary amino group. Preferred
diamines are lysine and ethylenediamine.We have now devised a new process for the
preparation of tetanus toxoid. Instead of toxoiding the
toxin and then purifying the toxoid, we purified the
toxin and then toxoided the purified toxin.
Surprisingly, however, many of these preparations were
found to be unstable, showing 
varying degrees of reversion to toxicity when stored at
37째C in the absence of formalin.We then looked at adding amino acids to the toxoiding
reaction at different concentrations, also varying the
formalin concentration, pH and incubation times. Reversion
to toxicity was difficult to avoid, except at the price of
low total combining power (TCP)/Lf
