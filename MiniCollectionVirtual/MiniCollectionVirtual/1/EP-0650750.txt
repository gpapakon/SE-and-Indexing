<ABSTRACT>
A filter includes a case (10), filtering material (30) 
housed within the case (10), a cover (40) which covers the 

open end of the case (10) and is non-rotatable relative to 
the case (10), and an annular fastener (50) clamping the 

cover (40) to the case (10). The case (10) includes a 
large-diameter portion (12) at an open end of the case (10), 

the large-diameter portion (12) including a convexity 
forming an engagement tab (13). The cover (40) has a 

concavity into which the convexity is received to prevent 
the cover (40) from rotating relative to the case (10). 

Moreover, the cover (40) includes a screw thread on the 
outer periphery thereof. The annular fastener (50) has a 

screw thread (52) on the inner periphery thereof and mated 
with the screw thread on the outer periphery of the cover 

(40). On the other hand, the annular fastener (50) has a 
small-diameter portion engaged with the large-diameter 

portion (12) of the case (10) by which engagement and mating 
of the screw threads the annular fastener (50) secures the 

cover (40) to the case (10). By preventing relative 
rotation between the cover (40) and the case (10), the 

filter can be easily installed by being screwed onto a 
threaded member of an automotive engine or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter according to the preamble
of claim 1 and, more
particularly, to a filter having replaceable filtering
material.Japanese Unexamined Practical Idea Publication No. 3-46812
discloses a prior art filter.As shown in Fig. 13, this filter includes a case 1
having a cup-shaped body and a flange 2 which extends
radially from the outer periphery of the body proximate the
open end of the body. A cover 3 covers the open end of the
case 1. The cover 3 includes a tubular portion 4, the inner
diameter of which is sized to receive the open end of the
case 1. The tubular portion 4 constitutes a male portion on
which a screw thread is formed.An annular fastener 5 has an L-shaped cross section
constituted by a cylindrical portion 6 and a retainer 7. A
screw thread screwable to the male thread of the tubular
portion 4 is formed at the inner peripheral surface of
cylindrical portion 6, whereby the cylindrical portion 6
constitutes a female portion of the fastener. The retainer
7 extends from the end of the cylindrical portion 6 toward
the center of the fastener 5. The inner diameter of the
cylindrical portion 6 is larger than the outer diameter of
the case taken at the flange 2, and the inner diameter of
the retainer 7 is smaller than the outer diameter taken at
the flange 2 but larger than the outer diameter of the cup-shaped 
body of the case. A filtering material 8 is housed
within the case 1.When the case 1 and cover member 3 are to be secured,
an O-ring 9 is disposed on the flange 2 of the case 1, and
the open end of the case 1 is inserted into the tubular
portion 4 of the cover 3. Next, the fastener 5 is fitted
over the case 1 whereupon the case passes through the
cylindrical portion 6 and retainer 7. The screw thread
formed on the inner periphery of the cylindrical portion 6
and the screw thread formed on the outer periphery of the
tubular portion 4 are screwed together by rotating the
fastener 5 in one direction. When so tightened, the
retainer 7 contacts the flange 2, becomes integrated with
the cover 3, and pulls the case 1 into the cover 3. When
the case 1 is to be removed, the fastener 5 is rotated in
the opposite direction.In the above-described prior art filter apparatus, if
the case 1 is supported and the fastener 5 is rotated, the
cover 3 tends to rotate together with the fastener 5,
whereby it is not possible to secure the cover 3 tightly to
the case 1. In particular, when the cover 3 has a generally
overall planar configuration and a threaded hole formed at
the center
