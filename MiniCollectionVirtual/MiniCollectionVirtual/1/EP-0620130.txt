<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pneumatic vehicle tyre consisting of a carcass which is provided with layers made of different rubber compounds, the carcass having in the region of the tread a profile arrangement under which all-round steel and/or textile arrangements, or plastic panels in a sandwich design are arranged in order to reinforce the tread. The carcass also has a bead foot which adjoins the respective side wall on both sides, can be inserted into a rim bead and consists of at least one bead core made of a tension-resistant material with in each case an associated filler which is seated on each bead core, the said fillers being enclosed by the carcass. The intention of the invention is to provide a pneumatic vehicle tyre which is easy to manufacture, has good running properties and, while fulfilling rigidity requirements in the bead area, can be easily mounted on customary rims and can, in particular, be satisfactorily disposed of. The invention is characterised in that the bead core (1) consists of a mono-winding of a continuously wound, high-strength textile cord (2), and in that the bead core (1) is surrounded at least partially by an additional sleeve (3) made of a flexurally strong material.
