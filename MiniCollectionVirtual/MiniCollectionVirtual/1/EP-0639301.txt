<ABSTRACT>
This invention is in the area of electrical technology, of a means for the continuous transformation of electrical energy with its subsequent transmission from the initial source to a consuming device via a single-wire transmission line. The purpose of the invention is the creation of a highly efficient means for the transformation and transmission of electrical energy, employing both fixed and mobile devices which transform the electrical energy of initial sources and transmit it to consuming devices in a manner involving significantly reduced losses of Joulean heat resulting from the ohmic resistance of the transmission lines, and also the reduction of the metal content of such line. The invention may be used in conjunction with various power-generating and technological processes based on the use of super-high voltage electrical and electromagnetic fields, electron beams and long-wave radio links. The purpose of the invention is achieved by means of the transformation of the electrical energy from the initial source into the energy of oscillation of a field of free electrical charges (the displacement current or longitudinal wave of an electrical field), which energy is transmitted to the consuming device via a single-wire transmission line and, where necessary, transformed into the electrical energy of the conductive currents of a closed circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of electrical 
technology, and relates particularly to a method for the 
continuous transformation of electrical energy with its 
subsequent transmission from an initial source 
(transformer) to a consuming device, and also to an 
apparatus for the implementation of this method of 
transformation and the supplying of power to electrical 
devices through a transmission line which does not form a 
closed circuit, ie consists of a single conducting wire. There exists a means for the transmission of 
electrical energy along a conducting wire which does not 
form a closed circuit ie, a single conducting wire. It 
is based on the discovery in 1729 by the English 
physicist Stephen Grey of the phenomenon of electrical 
conductivity. The essence of this phenomenon consists in 
the fact that electricity may be transmitted from one 
body to another along a metal conductor or a length of 
yarn, and that the electrical charge is distributed over 
the surface of the conductor. [Yu. A. Khramov, "Physicists: A Biographical 
Refe-rence Book," Moscow, "Nauka", 1983 (in Russian) ; 
"Dictionary of Scientific Biography," New York, Charles 
Scribener's Sons, 1970-1978]. As to closed circuits, a well known means for the 
supplying of power to electrical devices has existed 
since the creation in 1799 by the Italian scientist 
Alessandro Volta of the first source of prolonged 
electrical current (Volta's column). This means is based 
on the transmission of electrical energy generated in the 
initial source to the consuming device directly through a 
transmission line consisting of two conducting wires  
 
which together with the source and the load form a closed 
circuit. [Yu A Khramov, "Physicists: A Biographical Reference 
Book", Moscow, "Nauka", 1983 (in Russian) ; M I 
Radovsky, Galvani and Volta, Moscow-Leningrad, 1941 (in 
Russian); G. Polvani, "Alessandro Volta," Pisa, 1942]. There exists another important type of closed 
circuit that represents a means for the supply of power 
to electrical devices based on the discovery made by M 
Faraday and J Henry of the phenomenon of electromagnetic 
induction (published by M Faraday in 1831, and on the 
invention by P N Yablochkov in 1876 of the electrical 
transformer. The essence of this means consists in the 
transformation of the current or the voltage of 
electrical energy generated in the initial source and the 
transmission line to the consuming device. [M Faraday, Experimental Research in Electricity, 
Moscow-Leningrad, Publishing
