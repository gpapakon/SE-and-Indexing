<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cleaning compositions.
More particularly, the cleaning compositions according to the
present invention are stable aqueous emulsions of nonionic
surfactants particularly suitable for the pretreatment of
laundry or the cleaning of hard surfaces.A great variety of cleaning compositions have been described
in the art. For instance, in European Patent
Application EP-A-598170, a particular type of cleaning
compositions is described which are aqueous emulsions of a
nonionic surfactant system. Such emulsions find a preferred
application in the formulation of bleaching compositions
comprising hydrogen peroxide or water soluble source thereof
and a liquid hydrophobic bleach activator, or any other
hydrophobic ingredient which needs to be separated from
hydrogen peroxide. Alternatively, such emulsions can be used
to formulate products which do not contain hydrogen peroxide.
In the latter case, such emulsions can be useful because they 
allow to keep a given hydrophobic ingredient separate from
the aqueous phase, with which said hydrophobic ingredient
could react, e.g., by hydrolysis. Another advantage of such
emulsions is that they provide a means to formulate
ingredients with very low water solubility, without the need
for using alcoholic or solvent mixtures, which are usually
undesirable for aesthetic (odour) and toxicity reasons.A problem with such emulsions, especially with emulsions
containing relatively high concentrations of surfactants,
e.g, about 8 %, is that important viscosity tends to build
up, which makes said emulsions difficult to dispense, and
thus unacceptable from a consumer viewpoint.It is thus an object of the present invention to formulate
aqueous emulsions of nonionic surfactants wherein the
viscosity can be conveniently controlled.Various viscosity agents such as sodium cumene sulphonate and
polyacrylates have been tried in this context, which resulted
in a decreased viscosity but also reduced phase stability.It is thus another object of the present invention to provide
aqueous emulsions of nonionic surfactants wherein the
viscosity can be conveniently controlled while maintaining
adequate physical stability.In order to manufacture such aqueous emulsions of nonionic
surfactants, it is necessary to vigorously mix the
ingredients together. During this vigorous mixing, lots of
air bubbles are generated which are detrimental both to the
composition's aesthetics and stability. Indeed, surfactants
tend to concentrate at the air/liquid interfaces generated by
said
