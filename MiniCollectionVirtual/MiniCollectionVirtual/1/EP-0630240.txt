<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to
pharmaceutical compositions, and primarily to topically
applied ophthalmic compositions comprising as the
active ingredient one or more gamma amino butyric acid
agonist compounds. The pharmaceutical compositions are
useful for reducing intraocular pressure in animals of
the mammalian species. In another aspect, the present
invention is directed to administering such
formulations and compositions to animals of the
mammalian species (including humans) for reducing
intraocular pressure in the eye.Glaucoma is an optical neuropathy associated with
elevated intraocular pressures which are too high for
normal function of the eye, and results in irreversible
loss of visual function. It is estimated in medical
science that glaucoma afflicts approximately 2 per cent
of the population over the age of forty years, and is
therefore a serious health problem. Ocular
hypertension, i. e. the condition of elevated
intraocular pressure, which has not yet caused
irreversible damage, is believed to represent the
earliest phase of glaucoma. Many therapeutic agents
have been devised and discovered in the prior art for
the treatment or amelioration of glaucoma and of the
condition of increased intraocular pressure which
precedes glaucoma.Gamma amino butyric acid (H2N(CH2)3COOH, GABA) is 
a natural metabolite, a break-down product of glutamine
and a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. Its chemical
structure can be described as an aliphatic carboxylic
acid which carries an amino function on the terminal
carbon of the aliphatic chain.The concept of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)
receptors has been known in the biological sciences for
a long time. According to the classical definition,
GABA receptors of living organisms, (including mammals
and particularly humans) are those biological receptor
sites which are activated by GABA. Agonist of a
receptor are those compounds or substances which bind
to the receptor site and elicit a response.
Accordingly, agonist of GABA receptors are those
compounds which bind to and elicit a response on GABA
receptor sites. The compound gamma aminobutyric acid
itself by definition, is a GABA agonist, and several
other GABA agonist are known in the pharmaceutical and
related sciences.The following patents (and other references) are
believed to be pertinent as background to the present
invention, either because they describe or relate to
compounds or compositions for reducing intraocular
pressure (anti-glaucoma), or because they relate to the
biological activity of
