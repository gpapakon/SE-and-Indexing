<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat exchanger (1) provided 
with a feed opening (2) and a discharge opening (3) for a medium, 

which openings are mutually connected by a duct (4) substantially 
rectangular in cross section, through which duct 

transverse ducts (5) for a medium on the outside of the 
insert heat exchanger are arranged practically perpendicularly 

of the flow direction of the medium in the duct.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a insert heat exchanger. In
the transfer of heat from a first medium to a second
medium the efficiency of the transfer is of very great
importance. Another important factor is the complexity of
the construction of the heat exchanger. This is of
particular relevance in the manufacture thereof and in
the later servicing of the heat exchanger.The European patent application EP-A-0 291 322
discloses a heat exchanger according to the preamble of claim 1, especially a heat exchanger
in the form of a comfort heat exchanger. The heat
exchanger comprises two manifold elements adapted to
receive and discharge fluid, and a plurality of tube
units transverely located between the manifolds. The
manifolds are held in spaced apart relationship by end
panels thus forming a duct substantially rectangular in
cross section. By feeding water through the tube units an
air flow between the manifolds and the end panels can be
heated or cooled as required in the heating and
airconditioning systems of automobiles.The present invention has for its object to provide
a structurally simple insert heat exchanger which is
comparatively inexpensive to manufacture and which
moreover produces a very high efficiency. The invention
has the additional objective of combining a high insert
heat exchanger efficiency with a limited volume of the
heat exchanger.This is achieved by the invention with a insert heat
exchanger in accordance with claim 1. Such a insert heat
exchanger combines a relatively high efficiency with a
very simple and therefor inexpensive construction. The United States patent US-A-4 034 803 discloses a
tubular air preheater for transfer of heat from hot flue
gasses. The air preheater comprises a feed opening and a
discharge opening for clean air for combustion purposes,
which openings are mutually connected by a duct
substantially rectangular in cross section. Inside the
rectangular conduit are a plurality of heat exchange
elements containing a plurality of thin walled tubes in
which flue gasses flow in counter flow relative to the
cool air flow for combustion purposes through the
rectangular conduit.Cross sections through the transverse ducts are in
preference practically circular. The heat exchanger is
found in this case to produce a high efficiency.The largest surface area of a cross section through
a transverse duct perpendicular to the flow direction of
the medium through the duct preferably amounts to
about 40% of the surface area of the cross section
through the duct. This ratio is found to
