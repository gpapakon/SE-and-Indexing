<ABSTRACT>
Fold edges (F) of products (P) made of paper, such as newspapers, magazines, are folded in accordance with the method according to the invention in that at least one pair of folding tools (W.1 and W.2) act at a folding point from both sides against the fold edge, and the folding point is moved along the fold edge (F) by a relative movement between the product (P) and at least one of the folding tools. The mutually facing folding surfaces of the folding tools (W.1, W.2) are advantageously designed and arranged in such a way that the fold edge is curved at the folding point, which is achieved in that a perpendicular line onto the folding faces at the folding point forms an acute angle with the direction of movement (B) of the folding point. The folding tools can also be pressed against one another with a pressing force. During the folding operation, the product must be held by holding means. These holding means can also be conveying means, e.g. grippers on a gripper chain which convey the product continuously over a conveying route. In this case, each conveying means is assigned at least one pair of folding tools which move essentially synchronously with the conveying means over at least part of the conveying route in addition to their movement along the fold edge.

folding tool each of at least one pair of folding tools
(W.1/W.2) is positioned with folding faces on each side

of the fold edge in such a way that the mutually opposite
folding faces of the two folding tools act on the product

in the region of the fold edge, the folding faces of the
folding tools of a pair acting on the product at least

along one folding line (C) and the folding line (C)
intersecting a line (L), on which the fold edge (F) to be

folded is arranged, at a folding point, and in which
method the folding point is moved along the fold edge (F)

by means of an appropriate relative movement between
product (P) and at least one of the folding tools (W.1,

W.2) in a direction of movement (B) that is directed
parallel to the line (L), characterized in that, during

the folding operation, the products are firmly held by
holding means (H), in that the holding means are at the

same time conveying means (41), with which the products
are conveyed continuously over a conveying section in a

conveying direction (FR), and in that the folding tools
are moved concomitantly over part of the conveying

section in the conveying direction (FR), this movement,

a movement in the said direction (B).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the folding line (C) intersects the line (L) perpendicularly

or obliquely at an acute angle (β) in such a
way that the part of the folding line (C) that is

directed towards the product leads in the direction of
movement (B).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the fold edge (F) is curved by the folding faces of

the folding tools (W.1, W.2) in the region of the folding
point as a result of the fact that a perpendicular (K) to 

the folding faces at the folding point forms, together
with the direction of movement (B) of the folding point,

an acute angle (α).
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized
in that the fold edge (F) is pressed at the

folding point as a result of the fact that the folding
faces of the folding tools (W.1, W.2) are pressed against

each other with a pressing force.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that at least one of the folding tools (W.1,

W.2) of a pair rolls in a free or driven manner on the
product (P) or on its fold edge (F).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the products are firmly held in the

region of an edge (1) which abuts the fold edge (F) to be
folded, and in that the folding tools are moved over the

fold edge (F), away from the held edge (1).
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the products are firmly held in a central

region of an edge (3) which lies opposite the fold
edge (F) to be folded, or are firmly held in a central

region of the fold edge (F) to be folded, and in that two
pairs of folding tools are moved simultaneously fr
om the
centre of this fold edge (F), each towards one of the

ends of the said fold edge.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the products have two fold edges (F.3,

F.4) to be folded, these edges abutting each other at a
product corner, in that the products are firmly held in

the region of this corner, and in that the pairs of
folding tools are moved simultaneously over both fold

edges, away from the firmly held corner.
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the products are deflected and transferred from one

conveying direction (70) into a further conveying direction
(73) as an imbricated stream (72) with the fold

edges to be folded located at the top and leading, in
that the imbricated stream (72) is then deflected (74) in

such a way that the fold edges to be folded are directed 
downwards in the stream and are conveyed in a suspended

manner in a direction (FR) opposite to the further
conveying direction (73), their fold edges to be folded

being folded by two pairs each of folding tools, in that
the folded fold edges of the products are guided with

respect to the held edges, and the stream is deflected,
both in such a way that the folded fold edges come to lie

at the top and the imbricated stream (77) is deflected
and transferred in a conveying direction (71) that

corresponds to the conveying direction (70).
