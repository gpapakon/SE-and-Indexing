<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for haemostatic 
treatment following catheterization. It comprises an 

elongated tubular penetration member with at least one 
longitudinal channel which ends close to an external end in 

a connecting piece, a pressure gauge, connecting means for 
connecting the connecting piece to the pressure gauge, a 

supply means for a haemostatic pharmacon comprising a 
reservoir for the collagen and a supply line connected to it 

which terminates in a connecting member. Close to the 
external end the penetration member is provided with an 

associated connecting member in which a longitudinal channel 
of the penetration member ends. The invention relates to and 

also provides a penetration member to be used with a 
device as described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device used to carry 
out haemostatic treatment following catheterization. Following catheterization and after removal of 
the catheter introduction member inserted through the skin 
and the vascular wall, a puncture wound will remain which is 
at times difficult to close and may continue to bleed for a 
long time. It is a well-known procedure to apply a plug of 
haemostatic pharmacon up against the vascular wall in order 
to stem the flow of blood. Correct positioning of the 
collagen plug is difficult to achieve however. The object of the invention is to provide a 
device with which such treatment can be simplified. According to the invention this is achieved with 
the device as characterised in claim 1. Following catheterization, the penetration member 
which has first been inserted through the skin and the 
vascular wall, is withdrawn gradually whilst observing the 
pressure gauge connected to the connecting piece. When the 
pressure gauge indicates a falling pressure, it is an 
indication that the end of the penetration member has been 
drawn back to a position right inside or just outside the 
vascular wall. By way of the supply means, which is 
connected to a longitudinal channel of the penetration 
member by means of the attached connecting pieces, a 
haemostatic pharmacon is deposited in exactly the right 
position. Thus it is ensured that the haemostatic pharmacon 
will not end up in the blood vessel itself which could 
result in a serious complication for the patient. The device according to the invention can be 
manufactured as characterised in claim 2. As the phase 
during which the haemostatic pharmacon is supplied follows  
 
pressure measurement, one and the same channel can be used 
for both the pressure measurement and the supply of the 
haemostatic pharmacon. The invention relates to and also provides a 
penetration member which is apparently designed for a device 
according to the invention as described above. This member is preferably manufactured as 
characterised in claim 4. Consequently, exact positioning of 
the penetration member and more in particular of the opening 
through which the haemostatic pharmacon will be ejected in 
or close to the vascular wall can be effected. The 
haemostatic pharmacon will always be ejected in a position a 
little further back from where the pressure is measured so 
that one can be assured that this haemostatic pharmacon will 
be deposited in the right place. The invention will be explained in the following 
description
