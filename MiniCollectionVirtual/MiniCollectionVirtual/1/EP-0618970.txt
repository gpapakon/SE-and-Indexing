<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a recombinant human monoclonal antibody which binds to a discontinuous epitope on the HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein, blocks the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor, and neutralizes a broad range of HIV isolates. The present invention also provides the primary nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the rearranged heavy and light chains of the recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention, and a method of screening for antibodies which block binding of envelope glycoprotein to the CD4 receptor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 REACTIVE NEUTRALIZING HUMAN ANTI-GP120 RECOMBINANT ANTIBODY, DNA CODING THE SAME AND USE THEREOFFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a recombinant human monoclonal antibody which binds to a discontinuous epitope on the HIV gpl20 envelope glycoprotein, blocks the binding of gpl20 to the CD4 receptor, and neutralizes a broad range of HIV isolates. The present invention also provides the primary nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the rearranged heavy and light chains of the recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention, and a method of screening for antibodies which block binding of envelope glycoprotein to the CD4 receptor.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1, also referred to as HTLV-III, LAV or HTLV-III/LAV) is the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related disorders. [Barre-Sinoussi, et al.. Science, 220:868-871 (1983); Gallo, et al., Science, 224:500-503 (1984); Levy, et al.. Science, 225:840-842 (1984); Popovic, et al.. Science, 224:497-500 (1984); Sarngadharan, et al.. Science, 224:506-508 (1984); Siegal, et al., New England Journal of Medicine, 305:1439-1444 (1981)]. This disease is characterized by a long asymptomatic period followed by the progressive degeneration of the immune system and the central nervous system. Studies of the virus indicate that replication is highly regulated, and both latent and lytic infection of the CD4 positive helper subset of T-lymphocytes occur in tissue culture [Zagury, et al.. Science, 231:850- 853 (1986) ] . The expression of the virus in infected patients also appears to be regulated as the titer of 

 infectious virus remains low throughout the course of the disease. Molecular studies of the replication and genomic organization of HIV-l show that it encodes a number of genes [Ratner, et al.. Nature, 313:277-284 (1985); Sanchez- Pescador, et al.. Science, 227:484-492 (1985); Muesing, et al., Nature, 313:450-457 (1985); ain-Hobson, et al.. Cell, 40:9-17 (1985)]. Three of the genes, the gag, pol and env genes are common to all retroviruses. The genome also encodes additional genes that are not common to most retroviruses, the tat, rev (formerly referred to as art) , nef, vi , vpr and vpu genes [Sodroski, et al. , Science, 231:1549-1553 (1986); Arya, et al., Science, 229:69-73 (1985); Sodroski, et al.. Nature, 321:412-417 (1986); Feinberg, et al. , Cell, 46:807-817 (1986); Haseltine, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 1:217-240 (1988);
