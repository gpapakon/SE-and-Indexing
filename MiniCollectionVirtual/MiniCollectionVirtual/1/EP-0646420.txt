<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of multicoat finishes by electrophoretic deposition of a first coating film of an aqueous first coating composition on an electroconductive substrate, application of a second coating film based on a pulverulent second coating composition, and baking (firing) of both the resultant coating films, characterised in that a pulverulent coating composition based on binders containing no diene-based polymer units is used for the second coating film, the coating composition being selected so that the minimum baking temperature range of the second coating film is above that of the first coating film or overlaps therewith so that the lower limit of the range for the second coating film is above the lower limit of the range for the first coating film.

Process for the production of multi-layer lacquer 
coatings by electrophoretic deposition of a first 

coating layer of a first, aqueous coating composition 
onto an electrically conductive substrate, application 

of a second coating layer based on a second, 
pulverulent coating composition and combined stoving 

of the coating layers obtained in this manner, 
characterised in that a pulverulent coating 

composition is used for the second coating layer which 
contains no diene-based polymer units, wherein the 

coating compositions are selected such that the 
minimum stoving temperature interval of the second 

coating layer is above that of the first coating layer 
or overlaps therewith in such a manner that the lower 

limit of the second coating layer interval is above 
the lower limit of the first coating layer interval. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the coating compositions are selected such that the 

minimum stoving temperature interval of the second 
coating is above that of the first coating. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a cathodic electrocoating 

lacquer based on intrinsically or extrinsically 
crosslinking binders containing at least partially 

neutralised primary, secondary and/or tertiary amino 
groups, having an amine value of 20 to 250 and a 

weight average molecular weight of 300 to 10000, is 
used as the first coating composition. 
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that 
binders based on aminoacrylate resins, aminoepoxy 

resins, aminopolyurethane resins, polybutadiene resins  
 

containing amino groups or modified epoxy resin/carbon 
dioxide/amine reaction products are used. 
Process according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that a lead-free cathodic electrocoating lacquer is 

used. 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that a 
cathodic electrocoating lacquer is used which contains 

one or more organic bismuth complexes and/or bismuth 
salts of carboxylic acids as catalysts. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a pulverulent coating 

composition based on film-forming base resins having 
glass transition temperatures of 30 to 120Â°C and a 

number average molecular weight of 500 to 20000 is 
used. 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that a 
pulverulent coating composition is used which contains 

neither pigments nor extenders. 
Process according to claim 8, characterised in that it 
is performed to produce stone impact protection 

layers, interlayers and surfacer layers in multi-layer 
lacquer coatings. 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that a 
pulverulent coating composition is used which contains 

neither inorganic pigments nor inorganic extenders and 
contains as extenders one or more polymer powders 

which are chemically inert and do not soften under 
application and stoving conditions. 
Process according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the polymer powders used are those based on aldehyde  

 
condensation products, polyacrylonitrile resins and/or 

polyamide. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the second coating composition 

layer is applied as a stone impact protection layer, 
surfacer layer, topcoat lacquer layer or base lacquer 

layer for multi-layer coatings. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that one or more further coatings are 

applied onto a multi-layer lacquer coating consisting 
of two layers. 
Process according to one or the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it is performed to produce 

multi-layer lacquer coatings on automotive bodywork or 
components thereof. 
Electrically conductive substrate coated using the 
process of one of the preceding claims.
