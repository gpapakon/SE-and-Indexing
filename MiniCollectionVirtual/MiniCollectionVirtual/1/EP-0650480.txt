<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to novel 1-phenylsulphonyl 3-phenyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridazine
compounds, and to novel methods for preparing the
compounds. The novel compounds are useful as contraceptives and in the
treatment of osteoporosis. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical
compositions in which a compound of the present invention is the active
ingredient.The unacylated 3-phenyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyridazine, A, is described by J-L.
Aubagnac et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. France, 7. 2868, (1972). A number of 1-acylated
derivatives of 1 are also disclosed.

W. Jones et al., J. Het. Chem., 21, 889 (1984) disclose that the thiocarbamoylation
of A with methyl isothiocyanate produces the corresponding thiocarbamide
derivative, B. No biological activity is disclosed.
S. J. Clarke et al., J. Chem.Research, (S) 310 (1985) disclose carbamate,
carbamide and para-toulene sulfonamide derivatives of A. (sulfonamide derivative
is C), which are prepared via cycloaddition reactions. Again, no biological activity
is disclosed.

sulfonamide and carbamate derivatives of A, (sulfonamide derivative is 4)
which compounds are also prepared by cycloaddition reactions. As above, no
biological activity is disclosed.
 
Kalyanam et al., Synthetic Communications. 18 (16 & 17), (1988) disclose
compounds of the formula:
