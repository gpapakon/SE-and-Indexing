<DESCRIPTION>
 7-DISUBSTITUTED-METHY -4-OXO-3H,5H-PYRROLO[3,2-d]PYRIMIDINE AND PHARMACEUTICAL USES ANDCOMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAMEThe present invention relates to derivatives of 4-oxo- 3H,5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine. In particular, it relates to 4- oxo-3H,5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidinederivativessubstitutedatthe 7-position. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) catalyzes the phosphorolysis of purine nucleosides in a reversible reaction. Individuals who are deficient in PNP exhibit impaired T-cell development, resulting in lowered cell-mediated immunity, but normal B-cell development, resulting in normal humoral immunity. Accordingly, specific inhibitors of PNP that selectively inhibit T-cell development without damaging humoral immunity could be potentially effective against disorders in which activated T- cells are pathogenic.Accordingly, the present invention is a compound of the formulawherein R1 is H, NH2, or OCH3, R2 is an optionally substituted cyclic group optionally containing one or more heteroatoms, R3 and R4 are independently H or C-,_4 alkyl, m is 0-4, n is 0-6, p is0-1 , X is CN , CSNH2 , PO (OH) 2 , COOH , S02NH2 , NH2 , OH , CNHNH2 , tetrazole, triazole or COR5 where R5 is C-,_4 alkyl, CF3, NH2, or0C-,.4 alkyl, and Y is O or NH. The compound of the present invention is useful as a PNP inhibitor. Also contemplated according to the present invention are a pharmaceutical composition for the selective suppression of mammalian T-cell immunity comprising an pharmaceutically effective amount of the compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and a method for the selective 

suppression of mammalian T-cell immunity without diminished effect on humoral immunity comprising administering to a subject a ' pharmaceutically effective amount of the compound of the present invention. The optionally substituted cyclic group (hereinafter referred to as cyclo) recited for the above formula includes aromatic, heteroaromatic, alicyclic, and heteroalicyclic groups preferably containing five to nine atoms. Preferred optional substituents include halogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, alkyl, and trifluoro ethyl. Exemplary substituents include chloro, fluoro, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl. Preferred heteroatoms include oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, which can be present in combination in the same group. The preferred aromatic and heteroaromatic groups are phenyl, 2- or 3-rthienyl, 2- or 3-furanyl, 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridinyl, 2- or 3- pyrrolyl, 2-, 4-, or
