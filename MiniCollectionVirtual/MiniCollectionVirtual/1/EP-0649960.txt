<ABSTRACT>
An overhead door holder assembly (10) for attachment 
between a door jamb (14) and a door (12) to hold the door 

in an open position includes a jamb bracket (16) attached 
to the door jamb and a jamb arm (18) pivotally attached to 

the jamb bracket. A channel assembly (22) having a channel 
(23) is attached to the door and a slide assembly (26) 

within the channel assembly is pivotally attached to the 
jamb arm. The slide assembly moves in response to opening 

and closing of the door until it reaches a stop block 
assembly (28) which absorbs the impact of the slide 

assembly at the limit of travel in the channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an overhead door holder 
assembly and more particularly to a stop block that is 
adjustably positionable to absorb force from a slide 
assembly connected to a door. Conventional overhead door stops are not suited for use in 
conjunction with electronic door closers. Such 
conventional overhead door stops commonly include one or 
more springs or other elastically compressible elements. 
These springs transiently engage a slide assembly that is 
pivotally connected to the door and moves in response to 
the door opening and closing. The engagement with the 
springs protects the door, the slide assembly and 
components of the overhead door holder assembly from damage 
caused by forceful or violent door opening. However, 
conventional door stops do not merely absorb the force of 
a slide assembly. Instead, a substantial amount of the 
force is briefly stored by the spring and redirected 
against the slide assembly. This reverses the direction of 
movement of both the slide assembly and the connected door, 
causing the door to swing shut. Unfortunately, for many 
conventional electronic door closers, the door swings back 
past its stop point and the door is not properly engaged by 
the electronic door closer. Proper installation is another common problem of 
conventional overhead stops. For normal operation, the 
stop position of the door holder and the electronic door 
holder should be coordinated. This requires precise 
adjustment of the stop block, and often requires several 
attempts before proper positioning is achieved. What is 
needed is an easily repositionable stop block that can be 
simply and quickly moved to different positions and locked  
 
into place, with the adjustments continuing until it 
matches the stop position of the electronic door closer. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
door holder assembly for attachment between a door jamb and 
a door for selectively holding the door in an open 
position, comprising a jamb bracket for attachment to the 
door jamb; a jamb arm pivotally attached to the jamb 
bracket; a channel assembly having a channel therein, and 
a slide assembly within said channel pivotally attached to 
the jamb arm for movement in response to opening and 
closing of the door; characterised by a stop block assembly 
positioned in the channel for absorbing impact of the slide 
assembly as the door, in use, is opened. The invention also extends to a door incorporating a door 
holder assembly essentially as just defined.

<CLAIMS>
A door holder assembly (10) for attachment between a 
door jamb (14) and a door (12) for selectively holding the 

door in an open position, comprising a jamb bracket (16) 
for attachment to the door jamb; a jamb arm (18) pivotally 

attached to the jamb bracket (16); a channel assembly (22) 
having a channel (23) therein, and a slide assembly (26) 

within said channel (23) pivotally attached to the jamb arm 
(18) for movement in response to opening and closing of the 

door; characterised by a stop block assembly (28) 
positioned in the channel (23) for absorbing impact of the 

slide assembly (26) as the door, in use, is opened. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the stop 
block assembly (28) has a stop block (29) at least 

partially formed from nylon filled thermoplastics. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the stop 
block assembly (28) has a stop block (29) at least 

partially formed from steel. 
An assembly according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the 
stop block assembly (28) has a or said stop block (29) and 

means (42) for frictionally engaging the channel (23) to 
hold open the door, with the engaging means being 

adjustably connected to the stop block. 
An assembly according to claim 4, wherein said 
engaging means (42) is a stop plate. 
An assembly according to claim 4 or 5, wherein the 
stop block (29) has a channel (41) therethrough, with walls 

of the stop block channel having threads for engaging a set 
 

screw (40) positioned in the channel to engage said 
engaging means (42). 
An assembly according to claim 4 or 5, wherein said 
engaging means (42) has serrations (144) for engagement 

with matching serrations (146) in said channel assembly 
(22). 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said channel assembly (22) is connected by 

end caps (24) for locating the channel assembly adjacent to 
a top of a door. 
A door incorporating a door holder assembly according 
to any one of the preceding claims.
