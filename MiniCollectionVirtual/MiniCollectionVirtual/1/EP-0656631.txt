<ABSTRACT>
A fuel assembly is presented in which a plurality of 
support grids (4) are disposed along the longitudinal direction 

of the fuel rods (6). The straps (7) forming the grid cells (5) 
of the support grids (4) are provided with mixing vanes (11) for 

generating turbulent flow of the cooling water passing through 
the grid cells(5). In a plan view of the support girds (4), 

each of the mixing vanes (11) protrudes inwardly of the grid 
cells (5) and is disposed along a positive diagonal direction 

and a negative diagonal direction. This configuration of the 
mixing vanes (11) are effective in preventing the generation of 

systematic vibrations in the fuel assembly by canceling the 
effects of the turbulent flows of the cooling water. The 

direction of protrusion of the mixing vanes (11) can be in two 
diagonal directions within one support grid, or it can be 

unidirectional along either diagonal direction within one 
support grid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel assembly used for a 
nuclear reactor, and relates in particular to a device for 
systematic vibration prevention. An example of a fuel assembly for use in a pressurized 
light water reactor is shown in Figure 9. In this drawing, the fuel assembly is provided with an 
upper nozzle 1, and a lower nozzle 2 which is oppositely spaced 
apart from the upper nozzle 1. A plurality of control rod guide 
pipes 3 are fixedly disposed between the upper nozzle 1 and the 
lower nozzle 2, and a plurality of support grids 4 are attached 
to the control rod guide pipes 3 in the middle section of the 
fuel assembly. As shown in Figures 10 and 11, the support grid 4 comprises 
a plurality of straps 7 crossing at right angles to each other 
to produce a grid network and a plurality of grid cells 5 
therein. A plurality of dimples 9 and springs 10 are provided 
on the opposing walls surrounding the grid cells 5 to provide 
support to the fuel rods 6 passing through the grid cells 5. 
The fuel rods 6 are elastically held in the grid cells 5 by 
being pressed by the springs 10 against the dimples 9.  
 In a perspective plan view of a grid cell shown in Figure 
11, it is seen that a pair of mixing vanes 11 protrude from the 
top edge near the intersections of the crossing straps 7. The 
function of the mixing vanes 11 is to generate a turbulent flow 
of cooling water for efficient removal of the heat generated by 
the fuel rod 6. The mixing vanes 11 are bent inward of the grid cell 5 at 
the top edge of the strap 7 so that the flow of the cooling 
water forcibly directed upwards from below (in the drawing) will 
be disturbed and stirred by the mixing vanes 11. The direction 
of the bend of the mixing vanes is determined as follows. As shown in a plan view of the support grid 4 in Figure 12, 
a pair of mixing vanes 11 are disposed at opposing corners 
(lower right and upper left corners in Figure 12) of each of the 
grid cells 5, and are bent inwards on the open space of the grid 
cells 5 throughout an entire fuel assembly. However, in such a configuration, because the mixing vanes 
11 are disposed unidirectionally in a diagonal direction in the 
support grid 4, the cooling water is extremely prone to 
cause vibration of the entire fuel assembly due to an unbalanced 
vibrational attenuation characteristics of each support grid. 
Furthermore, if vibrations are generated in the fuel rods 6, the 
fuel rods 6 are subjected to unidirectional vibrational forces 
(in the direction of arrow a in
