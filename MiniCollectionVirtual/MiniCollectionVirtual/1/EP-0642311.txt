<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a depilatory device for removing hair from the human body which is held in the user's hand and guided over the parts of the skin to be treated. The depilatory device has a cylinder rotatable about a central axis, the casing of which consists of at least one group of mutually fixed blades and at least one group of relatively movable clamping components. The blades or clamping components of a group are arranged side by side at least in pairs and the groups are fitted behind one another on the cylinder jacket in relation to one direction of rotation of the cylinder. Here the clamping components can move at least in pairs towards or away from one another, opening and closing a clamping gap. Neighbouring blades form a groove with a wedge or hopper-shaped width and at least one groove end section of smaller width is allocated to a clamping gap.

An epilating appliance for the removal of human 
body hairs which is adapted to be held in a user's hand 

and guided over the sections of the skin to be treated, 
including a cylinder (10) rotary about a center axis 

(12), the cylinder periphery (14) being formed by at 
least one group (20, 22) of relatively fixed blades (24, 

25) and at least one group (16, 18) of relatively movable 
gripping elements (26, 28), the blades (24, 25) and the 

gripping elements (26, 28) of a respective group (26, 28; 
16, 18) being arranged adjacent to each other at least in 

pairs, and the groups (20, 16, 22, 18) being in successive 
arrangement when viewed in a direction of rotation 

(30, 32) of the cylinder (10), with the gripping elements 
(26, 28) being adapted to approach each other and recede 

from each other at least in pairs, closing and, respectively, 
opening a gripping aperture (34, 35) in the process, 


characterized in that
 adjacent blades (24, 25) 
combine to form a groove (36) of a width (38) extending 

in wedge or funnel shape, and that at least one groove 
end section (44, 50) of reduced groove width (38) is 

associated with one gripping aperture (34, 35) each. 
An epilating appliance as claimed in claim 1, 

characterized in that
 each individual groove end section 
(44, 50) of reduced groove width (38) is associated with 

one gripping aperture (34, 35) each. 
An epilating appliance as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the blades (24, 25) are 
provided with a thickness (44) extending substantially in 

wedge shape. 
An epilating appliance as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the blade 
thickness (48) is essentially constant in the area of the 

groove end section (44, 50) of reduced width. 
An epilating appliance as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 two groove 
end sections (44, 50) of reduced groove width (38) opening 

into the gripping aperture (34) on either side 
thereof are associated with adjacent gripping elements 

(26, 28). 
An epilating appliance as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the groove 
width (38) is at a maximum value in a cylinder peripheral 

area (52) diametrically opposite the gripping elements 
(26, 28), or in a center section (51) of the cylinder  

 
peripheral area (52) located between groups (16, 18) of 

gripping elements (26, 28). 
An epilating appliance as claimed in any one of 
the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 n groups (20, 
22) of blades (24, 25) and n groups (16, 18) of gripping 

elements (26, 28), where n = 2, 3, ..., are disposed on 
the cylinder periphery (14) successively in alternating 

sequence, and that the groove (36) formed by adjacent 
blades (24, 25) of a group (20, 22) has its groove end 

section (44) associated with a respective gripping aperture 
(34, 35) of adjacent gripping elements (26, 28) of 

the subsequent group (16, 18) of gripping elements (26, 
28). 
An epilating appliance as claimed in claim 7, 

characterized in that
 the blades (24, 25) of the nth 
group (20, 22) and the gripping elements (26, 28) of the 

nth group (16, 18) are disposed on the cylinder periphery 
(14) in offset relation to the blades (24, 25) of the (n 

+ 1)th group (22, 20) and the gripping elements (26, 28) 
of the (n + 1)th group (18, 16). 
An epilating appliance as claimed in claim 8, 

characterized in that
 the amount of offset (54) of the 
blades (24, 25) and the gripping elements (26, 28) of the 

nth group (16, 20) in relation to the (n + 1)th group 
(18, 22) is equal to the mean groove distance (55) between 

adjacent grooves (36) divided by n. 
An epilating appliance as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
