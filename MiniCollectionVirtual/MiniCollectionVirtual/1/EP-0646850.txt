<ABSTRACT>
In an image transfer device for an image forming 
equipment, a bias for image transfer is applied from a power 

source to an endless transfer belt via a bias roller. A current 
from the transfer belt is released to ground via a ground 

electrode. Transfer control means variably controls a current 
I₁ output from the power source such that the difference 

between the current I₁ and a current I₂ flowing from the 
power source to the ground electrode via the transfer belt, 

i.e., 

I
out
 = I₁ - 1₂ 
 
 remains at a preselected target current. 

Setting means sets the target current on the basis of a set 
condition or conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image transfer
device for a copier, printer, facsimile apparatus or similar
image forming apparatus.It is a common practice with an image forming
apparatus to form an image on a photoconductive drum or
similar image carrier, transfer the image from the drum to a
sheet by an image transfer device, and then fix it on the sheet
by a fixing device. The image transfer device may be
implemented by a contact transfer scheme using, for example,
a transfer belt or a non-contact transfer scheme using a
corona discharger.For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No.
3-231274 (referred to as Prior Art 1 hereinafter) discloses
an image transfer device using a transfer belt. The transfer
belt is rotatable in contact with a photoconductive drum
while a sheet is fed to a nip portion between the drum and the
belt. As a transfer charge is applied from a power source to
the belt via a transfer electrode contacting the belt, a toner
image is transferred from the drum to a sheet being conveyed 
by the belt. The sheet carrying the toner image is separated
from the drum and conveyed by the belt. At this instant, a
controller measures a feedback current Ic flowing into the
controller via a belt support roller and controls, based on the
current Ic, a current Ir output from the power source such
that a difference Ir - Ic has a constant value.An image transfer device using a transfer roller is
disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication Nos. 3-158877 and 5-11645 (referred to as Prior
Arts 2 and 3 hereinafter, respectively). Prior Art 2 executes
constant current control by using two different target
constant currents in order to adapt to changes in environment.
Specifically, a detection electrode having a plurality of
different load characteristics is held in contact with the
surface of the transfer roller. When a sheet is conveyed, a
voltage to be applied to the transfer roller is controlled on
the basis of a current flowing through the detection
electrode. With this kind of approach, it is possible to
maintain optimal image transfer without regard to the
varying resistance or irregular resistance of the transfer
roller. On the other hand, Prior Art 2 causes the current-voltage
characteristic of the transfer roller relative to a
photoconductive element to converge to a given point on a
preselected current-voltage curve. As a result, despite the
varying resistance or irregular resistance of the transfer 
roller, an optimal transfer voltage is determined based on a
cu
