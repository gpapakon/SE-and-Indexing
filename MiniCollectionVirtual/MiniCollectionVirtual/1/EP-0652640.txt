<ABSTRACT>
Objective: To make it significantly easier to program the 
sensitivity of a proximity switch with a comparatively 

simpler configuration. 
Configuration: Circuit 21 to adjust the sensitivity is 
connected to oscillator circuit 2. Without using an object, 

the resistance value of circuit 21 is successively increased 
during oscillation, and the resistance value for the position 

in which oscillation ceases is detected. The sensitivity 
is set based on this resistance value. In this way the 

sensitivity can be set for the optimal position without the 
use of an object.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a proximity switch. More 
specifically, it concerns a proximity switch with the 
feature that its sensitivity can be adjusted and set. There are two types of proximity switches which use 
high frequency oscillation One detects a drop in amplitude 
of oscillation which occurs when an object is proximate. 
The other detects the proximity of an object based 
on a variation of frequency. Proximity switches which 
detect amplitude are widely used to detect objects containing 
magnetic metals. Figure 16 is a block diagram of 
an existing proximity switch of the type which detects 
amplitude. In this diagram we see parallel resonant 
circuit 1, consisting of oscillator coil L and capacitor 
C, and oscillator circuit 2. The output of oscillator 
circuit 2 is detected by detector circuit 3, and the drop 
in oscillation amplitude is detected by signal processor 
circuit 4. When a drop in oscillation amplitude is 
detected, a signal representing the detection of an 
object is output via output circuit 5. Power supply 
circuit 6 supplies power to each of the other blocks. 
Resistor Re, which is used to adjust the sensitivity, is 
a component of oscillator circuit 2. Figure 17 shows an example of a circuit which might 
be used for parallel resonant circuit 1 and oscillator  
 
circuit 2. In this circuit, the base of transistor Q₁ is 
connected to parallel resonant circuit 1 through resistor 
R₁ and diodes D₁ and D₂. A constant current is supplied 
to the base of transistor Q₁ by the power supply. Resistors 
R₂, R₃ and R₄ are connected in series to the emitter 
side of transistor Q₁ between the transistor and the 
ground terminal. The midpoint between resistors R₂ and 
R₃ is connected to the base of transistor Q₂. The aforementioned 
resistor Re, which adjusts the sensitivity, is 
connected to the emitter aide of transistor Q₂. A current 
mirror circuit consisting of transistors Q₃ and Q₄ 
is connected to the collector side of transistor Q₂. A 
current with a value equal to that flowing from the power 
supply into transistor Q₂ is fed back to parallel resonant 
circuit 1 by way of transistor Q₄. This creates a 
positive feedback loop resulting in oscillation. The 
graph in Figure 18 (a) shows the relationship between the 
amplitude of oscillation and the distance of the object 
to be detected for various values, from low to high, of 
the resistance of resistor Re. As can be seen from the 
graph, oscillation begins and ends abruptly when an 
object is positioned at a fixed distance. Figure 19
