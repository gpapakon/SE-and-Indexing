<ABSTRACT>
A CD-ROM (4 in Fig. 1) is provided with an area for 
forming a character/graphic pattern (14). The 

character/graphic pattern (14) is formed in such a way that 
data, which generate on the CD-ROM (4) two sorts of pit 

patterns having average reflectances different from each 
other to a perceptible extent, are respectively recorded 

inside and outside the character/graphic pattern (14). 
Unless an illegal copy disc is produced by duplicating the 

legal original disc of the CD-ROM (4) at a very high 
precision, the character/graphic pattern of the copy disc 

is invisibly deformed by the discrepancy between the 
arrangements of the pit patterns of the copy disc and the 

original disc (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to information recording
media, such as an optical disc or an optical card, on which
information are recorded in accordance with optical
features. More particularly, it relates to techniques for
inhibiting the illegal duplications of the information
recording media.A CD-ROM (compact disc read only memory), which is a
kind of optical disc, can be mentioned as a typical example
of information recording media on which information are
recorded by affording optical features thereto.Many types of CD-ROM adopt the CLV (constant linear
velocity) system in which data are recorded using pits of
regular intervals. This CLV system can make the data
capacity of the CD-ROM larger than the CAV (constant
angular velocity) system in which data are recorded using
pits of intervals determined in accordance with the radial
positions of the CD-ROM so that angles with respect to the
center thereof may be held constant at all times. Besides, 
in the CD-ROM's, frames are set as record units
irrespective of the CLV system and the CAV system. As
illustrated in Fig. 18 of the accompanying drawings, each
frame 1 is composed of data of fixed length, and a sync
signal 2 affixed to the head of the data.Incidentally, it is also possible that the CLV system
and the CAV system coexist on one optical disc.By way of example, according to a technique disclosed
in the official gazette of Japanese Utility Model
Registration Application Publication (KOKOKU) No.
44927/1993, an optical disc is provided with a record area
based on the CLV system and a record area based on the CAV
system, and still picture data, etc. are recorded in the
latter record area. In addition, according to a technique
disclosed in the official gazette of Japanese Patent
Application Publication (KOKOKU) No. 33470/1993, an optical
disc is provided with a record area based on the CLV system
and a record area based on the CAV system, and the
positions of the respective record areas are separately
recorded as address information. The address information
are utilized for the change-over between the rotational
controls of a disc motor for the record area based on the
CLV system and the record area based on the CAV system.In this specification, an "original disc (original
version)" is intended to mean a CD-ROM which is lawfully
produced from a "legal master disc (legal master version)". 
On the other hand, a "copy disc (copy version)" is intended
to mean a CD-ROM which is unlawfully produced from an
"illegal master disc (illegal master version)"
