A method for the drying and subsequent combustion, 
gasification or carbonisation of a water-containing 

fuel by direct contact with hot, granular solids 
residue, wherein the dried fuel is passed together with 

cooled residue into a reactor, is at least partly 
burned, gasified or carbonised therein, and residue 

produced thereby is brought into direct contact with 
water-containing fuel, characterised in that the hot 

solids residue at a temperature in the range of 500 to 
1200°C and the water-containing fuel are mixed in the 

inlet region of a mechanical mixer without any supply 
of fluidising gas, the mixture is transported from the 

inlet region through the mixer with further mixing 
across a mixing section of 1 to 10 m to an outlet and a 

largely water-free fuel-containing mixture is removed 
from the outlet at a temperature in the range of above 

100 to 150°C, and is passed into the reactor. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that a fuel-containing mixture is removed from the 

outlet of the mixer at a temperature in the range of 
103 to 130°C. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the dwell time of the fuel in the mixer is 2 to 

30 seconds. 
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that granular coal, granular brown 

coal or fuel-containing sludge is used as water-containing 
fuel. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a mixer having two interpenetrating  

 
shafts rotating in the same direction is 

used. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the largely water-free, fuel-containing 

mixture is burned, gasified or carbonised in 
a fluidised bed or in a circulating fluidised bed.
