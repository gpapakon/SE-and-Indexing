<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polishing
apparatus for a notch portion of a wafer which is used
for positioning adjustment or crystal orientation
adjustment of the wafer.Generally, a photolithographic technique is used for
the purpose of forming a pattern for a semiconductor
integrated circuit in a semiconductor wafer, e.g., a Si
single crystal wafer, a compound semiconductor wafer or
the like (hereinafter, which is simply called "a wafer").
Such an application of the photolithographic technique
requires a precise positioning adjustment and a precise
crystal orientation adjustment. For these requirements,
a linear portion is generally made on one side of the
periphery of the wafer in order to use the linear portion
as a standard for the positioning adjustment and the
crystal orientation adjustment. The linear portion of
the wafer is called an orientation flat.When such an orientation flat is formed on the
wafer, a portion of the periphery of the wafer is cut off
linearly. Therefore, the area of the cut portion of the
wafer is large, so the number of semiconductor chips
which can be fabricated from a wafer decrease. As a
result, according to such a conventional method in which
an orientation flat is formed on a wafer, it is
impossible to effectively utilize an expensive wafer. The
conventional method has another problem in that it is
difficult to treat wafers when each of the wafers has a
large diameter and an orientation flat, so the wafers are
not properly in balance, for example, on a work using a
spin dryer or the like in which the wafers are dried by a
centrifugal force due to a high speed rotation. Recently, in order to solve the above problems,
another method has been used in which a small notch
having a circular arc shape or a shape of a character "V"
in plan view is formed in a portion of the periphery of
each wafer. In this method, positioning and crystal
orientation adjustments of the wafer are carried out by
using the notch.Such a notch is formed by using a grinding wheel 31
or the like, as shown in FIG. 5. That is, the notch
portion 32 is formed by making the grinding wheel 31
press into a portion of the periphery of the wafer W and
by grinding the portion, as shown in the plan view of
FIG. 6. FIG. 7 is a vertically cross-sectional view
showing the wafer W cut along the line 7-7 of FIG. 6. The
wall of the wafer W in the notch portion 32 swells into a
curve toward the outside in the middle of vertical
direction, as shown in this Figure.In a photolithographic process, particle debris
limits
