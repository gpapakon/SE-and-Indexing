<ABSTRACT>
One end (28) of one of the glazing bead portions (21) is spaced from its respective frame member (11) at one and preferably both of the corner joints (15, 16) between that frame member (11) and the adjacent frame members (13, 14) so as to define a recess (23) between the glazing bead portion (21) and its respective frame member (11) at this corner region (15, 16) and through which a part of the glazed unit is exposed; and in which a decorative infill panel (24) is located in the recess (23) so as to cover the exposed part of the glazed unit (19) and also to provide a decorative corner effect with the glazing bead portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rectangular frame for doors 
and windows which incorporate single or double glazed units, 
and which are provided with decorative corner panels at at 
least some of the corners of the rectangular frame to modify 
the appearance of the frame. The invention has therefore been developed primarily 
with a view to enable the rectangular appearance of window / 
door frames to be modified in any required manner to provide 
decorative and / or distinctive effects at the corners. In traditional wooden framed windows, generally right 
angled corner inserts of wood have been provided to give a 
decorative appearance which softens the right angled corners 
of the window frame at the upper corners. These corner 
inserts are curved on their undersides, and together can form 
a curved edge which frames the upper edge of the window. 
These inserts are usually fitted in place by simple use of 
nails or screws. The invention is concerned with rectangular frames of 
extruded plastics, usually UPVC, which are being fitted to an 
ever increasing extent both in original construction of 
buildings, and also as replacement of existing wood framed 
windows. White UPVC frames provide an effective simulation 
of a conventional painted wooden frame, but without the need 
for routine maintenance, as no repainting is required. UPVC window frames are also now being supplied with 
wood grain effect on the exposed faces, and these are gaining 
in customer acceptance. However, there is a need to provide rectangular frames 
of suitable plastics and which can be modified in their 
appearance in a simple and reliable manner to provide any 
required decorative corner effects at some or all of the 
corners, and in order to simulate traditional designs 
previously only available with wood framed windows. The invention therefore addresses this need and 
provides a novel means of achieving this using decorative  
 
corner infill panels which can be easily and reliably 
installed at one or more corners of a rectangular frame 
composed of four frame members of extruded plastics joined 
together at their corners by any suitable means, including 
any of the techniques customarily involved. Therefore, the invention will enable conventional 
assemblies e.g. of UPVC window frames to have their corner 
appearances modified as desired, using decorative infill 
panels and without any need to modify the manufacture of the 
frame members. Accordingly, the invention provides a rectangular frame 
of extruded plastics composed of

<CLAIMS>
A rectangular frame (10) of extruded plastics 
composed of four frame members (11, 12, 13, 14) joined 

together at their corners (15, 16, 17, 18) to define a 
rectangular opening in which a single or double glazed unit 

(19) can be mounted, and separately formed glazing bead 
portions (21, 25, 26, 30) arranged along one side of the 

frame members and secured thereto in order to retain the 
glazed unit (19) in the frame (10) with each glazing bead 

portion being secured to a respective one of the frame 
members, in which: 


one end (28) of one of the glazing bead portions (21) 
is spaced from its respective frame member (11) at one of the 

corner joints (15, 16) between that frame member (11) and the 
adjacent frame member (13, 14) so as to define a recess (23) 

between the glazing bead portion (21) and its respective 
frame member (11) at this corner region (15, 16) and through 

which a part of the glazed unit (19) is exposed; and, 
a decorative infill panel (24) is located in said 
recess (23) so as to cover said exposed part of the glazed 

unit (19) and also to provide a decorative corner effect with 
the glazing bead portion (21). 
A frame according to Claim 1, in which the infill 
panel (24) is located in position by a coupling engagement 

with the glazing bead portion (21). 
A frame according to Claim 1 or 2, in which each 
glazing bead portion (21, 25, 26, 30) comprises a separately 

formed bead. 
A frame according to Claim 1 or 2, in which at 
least two of the glazing bead portions (25, 26, 30) are 

formed in one piece. 
A frame according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, in 
which a separate infill panel (24) is mounted at each of the 

two upper corners (15, 16) of a rectangular window frame 
(10). 
A frame according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, in  
 

which a single top glazing bead (21) runs full width across 
the frame (10) and is secured at each end (28) to a 

respective one of the adjacent upright frame members (13, 14) 
and has a single mid-region (22) of contact at engagement 

with the top frame member (11). 
A frame according to Claim 6, in which the top 
glazing bead (21) comprises a standard glazing bead co-operating 

with a standard profile of top frame member (11), 
but having the opposed ends (28) of the top glazing bead 

pulled downwardly to define the corner recesses (23) in which 
the infill panels (24) can be located. 
A frame according to Claim 7, in which the top 
glazing bead (21) comprises a rectilinear extrusion, 

subsequently deformed into the required shape by application 
of heat. 
A frame according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, in 
which the or each infill panel (24) comprises a right angled 

corner piece with a curved lower edge which merges to present 
a continuous curve with the top glazing bead (21), which 

overlies and frames the upper region of the glazed unit (19). 
A frame according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, in 
which the or each infill panel (24) has snap-fitting 

engagement with the top glazing bead (21). 
A frame according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, in 
which the or each infill panel (24) is retained in position 

by adhesive means to bond the inner (non-exposed) face of the 
panel (24) to the exposed face of the glazed unit (19). 
A frame according to Claim 1, and comprising a 
multi-panel door frame, in which one end of the glazing bead 

is coupled with one of the frame members at a suitable 
position along its length e.g. approximately midway, whereas 

the other end of the bead is coupled with the adjacent frame 
member at a small spacing from the corner between the two 

frame members, thereby defining a triangular recess in which 
a correspondingly shaped infill panel can be located. 
A frame according to Claim 1, in which the top 
glazing bead (21) has its ends (28) spaced from the two top  

 
corners (15, 16) of the rectangular frame (10) to define two 

recesses (23) for respective infill panels (24), said ends 
(28) seating themselves, in the manner of an arch, on the 

upper ends (27) of the two vertical glazing beads (25, 26) 
extending along the two vertical frame members (13, 14). 
A frame according to Claim 13, in which the 
engaging faces are mitred, and in which the curvature of the 

top glazing bead (21) and the infill panels (24) are made the 
same at each corner region, whereby the same mitre joint 

angle will be satisfactory, regardless of the width of the 
window, in that the intermediate part of the top glazing bead 

(21) can be of varied length and / or curvature to suit 
different frame widths, while keeping the same radius of 

curvature at each corner region (15, 16).
