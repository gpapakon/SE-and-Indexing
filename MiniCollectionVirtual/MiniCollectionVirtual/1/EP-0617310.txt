<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the invention to improve the display 
quality of a reflection type liquid crystal display device 

(30). A gate bus wiring (32), a source bus wiring (39), and 
a TFT (40) are formed on an insulating substrate (31), and an 

organic insulating film (42) having bumps (42b) is formed on 
them. A light shield film (45) is formed in the region 

above the TFT (40) on the surface of the organic insulating 
film (42), and a reflection electrode (38) is formed in the 

other region. The reflection electrode (38) is separated 
from the light shield film (45) by a gap (45a). An 

orientation film (44) is further formed on these components 
to complete one substrate (52). The one substrate (52) is 

bonded through a liquid crystal layer (50) to the other 
substrate (53)having a light emitting insulating substrate 

(46), a color filter (47), a transparent electrode (48), and 
an orientation film (49).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reflection type
liquid crystal display device in which an image is displayed
by reflecting light incident from the outside, and to a
method for manufacturing the device.Recently, the application of a liquid crystal display
device to word processors, lap top personal computers,
pocket televisions and others is rapidly expanding. In
particular, among liquid crystal display devices, a
reflection type liquid crystal display device in which an
image is displayed by reflecting light incident from the
outside is highly attractive because it can be constructed
in a reduced thickness and weight, and the amount of
consumed electric power is low due to no backlight.Conventionally, in a reflection type liquid crystal
display device, the TN (twisted nematic) method or the STN
(super-twisted nematic) method has been employed. In these 
methods, however, about half of a light intensity of natural
light can not be utilized for displaying due to a polarizer,
which causes a problem that the display is relatively dark.To solve the problem, a display mode has been proposed
in which no polarizer is used to effectively utilize natural
light. An example of such a display mode is the phase
transition type guest-host method (D. L. White and G. N.
Taylor: J. Appl. Phys. 45 4718, 1974). In this mode, the
cholesteric-nematic phase transition phenomenon due to an
electric field is utilized. Also, a reflection type
multicolor display is proposed, in which a micro color
filter is additionally utilized in the method. (Tohru
Koizumi and Tatsuo Uchida, Proceedings of the SID, Vol.
29/2, 157, 1988).In order to obtain a brighter display in such a mode
without requiring a polarizer, it is necessary to increase
the intensity of light scattering in a direction
perpendicular to the display screen, with respect to light
incident at any angle. For this purpose, it is necessary to
produce a reflector having an optimum reflective
characteristic. The above publication discloses a reflector
which is produced by roughening the surface of a substrate
made of glass or the like with an abrasive, varying the time
of etching with hydrofluoric acid to control the surface
roughness, and forming a silver thin film on the rough 
surface.In the reflector disclosed in the publication, the
irregularities can not be uniform in shape because the
irregularities are formed by grinding the glass substrate
with an abrasive. The reflector has another problem that
the reproducibility of the shape of the irregularities is
poor. In the
