<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of mouthwash compositions 
comprising particulate solids for treating dentine hypersensitivity and to mouthwash 
compositions comprising certain particulate solids. The occurrence of sensitivity in teeth is an increasingly common dental 
problem so that there is as continuing need not oily for improved actives but also 
improved presentations. Suitable actives known include water soluble strontium 
and potassium salts such as strontium acetate, strontium chloride, potassium nitrate, 
potassium chloride and potassium citrate; all of which are used in commercially 
available toothpastes. More recently, it has been suggested that an oral hygiene 
composition, in particular a dentifrice, comprising a combination of an insoluble 
agent (hydroxyapatite) and a soluble agent (potassium and/or strontium salt) may 
have useful antisensitivity properties. (EP 0 346 957-A, Unilever). Until recently, 
the oily antisensitivity compositions available were dentifrices. It is believed that 
in such dentifrices, the abrasive may also play a role, by occluding tubules and 
thereby providing an anti-sensitivity effect. Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest in the concept of 
antisensitivity mouthwashes. There is for instance now available in the UK, from 
Boots, a mouthwash containing potassium citrate which is alleged to be of use in 
treating sensitive teeth. In addition, there has been recently disclosed an abrasive 
mouthwash composition, for use as a "rinse and brush" product. This may 
optionally include a therapeutic agent, for instance an anti-plaque, anti-tartar or 
anti-sensitivity agent (WO 92/07547). 
EP-A-0 200 323 and EP-A-0 390 456 disclose oral hygiene compositions 
such as mouthwashes for treating dentine hypersensitivity comprising a strontium salt, 
a fluoride source and and abrasive and/or thickening silica. It is not known, however, 
that the abrasive and/or non abrasive particles themselves are able to alleviate dentine 
hypersensitivity.  
 We have now surprisingly found that finely divided solids when delivered in 
a mouthwash composition are effective in alleviating dentine hypersensitivity. The present invention therefore provides for the use of an anti-sensitivity 
system consisting of finely divided particulate solids and a water-soluble 
anti-sensitivity agent in the manufacture of a mouthwash composition further 
comprising a dentally acceptable vehicle or carrier, for treating dentine 
hypersensitivity. Finely divided particulate solids for
