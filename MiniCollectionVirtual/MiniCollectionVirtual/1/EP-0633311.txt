<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid detergent
compositions containing anionic surfactant and cellulase. In
the compositions according to the present invention the
cellulase is stabilized.Liquid detergent compositions comprising enzymes are well
known in the art. It is desirable that such compositions should
exhibit long term stability with respect to the enzyme.
However, it has been observed that in anionic surfactant liquid
detergent compositions the stability of enzymes, in particular
cellulases is greatly reduced. The incorporation of cellulase
enzymes in such compositions is highly desirable. Thus, the
storage instability of such compositions represents a problem
to the detergent manufacturer. It is believed that the reason for the cellulase
instability in the presence of anionic surfactants lies with
the interactions which occur between the anionic surfactant and
the three dimensional structure of the cellulase enzyme. This
results in the unfolding of the enzyme and a reduction in its
activity.It has also been observed that this problem is more acute
in the presence of protease enzyme. It is thought that the
unfolded cellulase enzyme is more vulnerable to attack by
protease. Thus, the presence of proteases further deactivates
the cellulases.Therefore it is an object of the invention to provide a
liquid detergent composition which comprises anionic surfactant
and cellulase, which is storage stable.In response to this object, the present invention proposes
to formulate liquid detergent compositions which comprise
liquid detergent soluble hydrophobic amines, which may be
primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary, as cellulase
stabilizing compounds.An advantage of the present invention is that it is
applicable to the protection of any cellulase, and also finds
application in the presence of protease.Amines have been disclosed in the art in liquid detergent
compositions.EP 160 762, EP 137 615 and EP 137 616 disclose liquid
detergents which comprise cyclohexylamine. Compositions are
exemplified which comprise anionics, protease and amylase, but
there is no mention of cellulase. The role of the
cyclohexylamine therein is to stabilize the compositions which
are in the form of microemulsions.EP 495 554 discloses detergent compositions comprising a quaternary ammonium
compound and a cellulase.EP 173 397 discloses detergent compositions comprising an anionic surfactant, a
cationic fabric softening compound which can be a quaternary amine, and a cellulase. EP 177 165, discloses detergent compositions
