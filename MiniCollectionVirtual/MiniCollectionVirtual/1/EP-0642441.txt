<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tilt rotor aircraft having 
variable diameter rotors and more particularly to a variable 
diameter rotor having an offset twist in its extended 
condition to provide enhanced performance. A tilt rotor aircraft is one which typically has a pair 
of tiltable pods containing an engine and rotor system 
supported on aircraft wings. The pods are movable between a 
vertical position when the engine driven rotors serve as 
helicopter rotors for vertical take off and landing, and a 
horizontal position where the rotors serve as propellers for 
forward flight. Typically, tilt rotor aircraft in operation today utilize 
a fixed diameter rotor system that represents a distinct 
design compromise between the requirements for hover and the 
requirements for high speed cruise. Because the rotor thrust 
in hover must lift the entire gross weight, the rotors are 
grossly over sized for a cruise flight regime, where the wings 
carry the weight and the rotor thrust required for propulsion 
is only a small fraction of the gross weight. Conversely, the 
rotors are undersized for the helicopter mode, a compromise to 
the cruise mode size requirement, and this results in an 
undesirable high disk loading in hover. Disk loading trends  
 
for conventional tilt rotors are on the order of twice that 
for conventional helicopters for a given gross weight, 
resulting in high hover power consumption, reduced hover 
endurance, and excessive downwash velocities. Lift efficiency (lift per unit of engine power) decreases 
as disk loadings are increased. Most helicopters operate at 
disk loadings that are less than 48 kg/m² (10 psf) to achieve reasonable 
lift efficiency and to maintain acceptable downwash velocity 
in the rotor wake. Disk loadings of about 68 kg/m² (14 psf) or higher 
result in downwash velocities of hurricane proportion. 
Present tilt rotor aircraft have disk loadings in the range of 
about 73 - 122 kg/m² (15-25 psf). For a tilt rotor, downwash 
velocities are further accelerated in the plane of symmetry 
along the fuselage due to the interference effects of side by 
side rotor arrangements. Another disadvantage of high disk 
loadings is that the autorotation characteristic in a 
helicopter mode is badly degraded. The autorotative rate of 
descent will be high and the stored rotor kinetic energy 
available to cushion touch down will be relatively low. Thus, 
while helicopters can land safely without power, it is 
unlikely that conventional tilt rotors will be able to do so. The preceding
