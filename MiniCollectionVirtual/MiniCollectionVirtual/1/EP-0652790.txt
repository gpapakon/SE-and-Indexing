<ABSTRACT>
Respirator apparatus (10) comprises a monocoque helmet (11), with a visor (14), which is pivotal between an inoperative raised position and an operative lowered position. The helmet (11) is formed of outer shells (17, 18) joined together along the rim and at strategic locations within the domed area of the helmet but are selectively spaced apart in various regions to provide an air chamber (19), at the rear of the helmet (11) and an air chamber (20) at the forward part of the helmet. These chambers (19, 20) are interconnected by three ducts (21, 22, 23). The chamber (19), opens through the outer shell and is fitted with an air filter (25), to receive incoming air. The chamber (20) opens through the inner shell (17) and is fitted with a fan (26) to propel air through the ducts (21, 22, 23) into a breathing zone formed behind the visor (14). The rear portion of the helmet is provided with a chamber (29) which is isolated from the ducts (21, 22, 23) and which accommodates batteries for energising the fan (26). The visor (14) may be arranged to activate the fan automatically when it is moved to its lowered position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to helmet respirator apparatus 
which provides protection for the head, face and eyes of a 
user and delivers filtered air for the user to breathe to 
protect the user from atmospheres contaminated with dusts, 
fumes, gases and vapours that are hazardous to health. Many forms of respirator apparatus of this type have 
been proposed and marketed but certain of these are of 
such a construction that the amount of head protection is 
less than that which can be provided with a conventional 
and non-respirated hard hat, and the level of respiratory 
protection provided in some of these devices is also 
limited to the lower order of respiratory hazards. There 
are statutory health and safety regulations in some 
countries that identify and set standards for protective 
helmets and respiratory devices. Some examples of these 
known devices are disclosed in patent specifications - 
Howie GB 2,201,601,A - Scott GB 2,227,158 and Berg/Kvaal

Some particularly relevant prior art is disclosed in European Patent 
Application 0 492 984. Examples of devices presently manufactured are the 
Airstream and Jupiter helmets manufactured by Racal Ltd.; 
The PF2 and PF3 Helmets manufactured by Pureflo Ltd., and 
the Clearflow Turbovisor manufactured by Pulsafe Ltd. 
All of these devices have features that make them  
 
difficult, awkward or cumbersome to use. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
new and improved form of helmet respirator apparatus which 
is easy to use and is of lightweight construction. Other 
objects and advantages of the present invention will be 
apparent from the ensuing description of preferred 
embodiments. According to the present invention there is provided 
respirator apparatus as defined in accompanying claim 1. A preferred 
embodiment comprises a helmet having a 
pivotally mounted face shield fitted to the front of the 
helmet (in the wearing position), the face shield carrying 
on its edge a flexible sealing member adapted when the 
face shield is in its lowered or operational position to 
seal at its lateral edges with the face of a person 
wearing the helmet, the lower edge of the sealing member

<CLAIMS>
A respirator apparatus (10) comprising a helmet (11) 
having a pivotally mounted face shield (14) fitted to the 

front of the helmet (11) in the wearing position, the 
face shield (14) carrying on its edge a flexible sealing 

member (16) adapted when the face shield (14) is in its 
lowered or operational position to seal at its lateral 

edges with the face of a person wearing the helmet (11), 
the lower edge of the sealing member (16) defining an 

exhalate outlet (45), wherein the helmet (11) comprises a 
plurality of lightweight shells (17,18) joined together to 

form a unitised structure incorporating a plurality of 
ducts (21,22,23) extending between the shells (17,18) to 

channel a plurality of air flows from a filtered air intake 
arrangement (24,25) in a rear portion of the helmet (11) 

to an air outlet arrangement (26,27) at the front of the 
helmet (11) and behind the face shield (14), air being 

powered through the ducts (21,22,23) by a motor driven fan 
(26) located within the ducts (21,22,23),
 
   characterised in that 


a) the motor-driven fan (26) forms part of the air 
outlet arrangement (26) 
b) batteries (28) providing a power source for the 
fan (26) are located within a compartment (29) formed 

in the rear portion of the helmet (11) and isolated 
from the ducts (21,22,23), 
c) the rear portion of the helmet (11) is provided 
with three apertures (24,29) opening through the 

outer shell (18) of which one aperture is centrally 
disposed and the other two apertures are laterally 

disposed and mutually opposed whereby to accommodate 
either a single battery compartment (29) and twin air 

filters (25) or a single air filter (25) and twin 
battery compartments (29) the arrangement being such 

that the batteries (28) and air filter (25) are 
replaceably mounted and releasable exteriorly via 

said apertures (24,29). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the shells 
(17,18) are joined together around the rim of the helmet 

(11) and at other suitable locations within the domed area of 
the helmet (11) to provide a monocoque construction. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the inner 
shell (17) is essentially a smooth dome shape with a 

peripheral rim, the outer shell (18) has a domed region 
which is profiled to define the ducts (21,22,23) and the 

domed region of the outer shell (18) lying outwith the 
ducts (21,22,23) is bonded to the smooth dome of the inner 

shell (17). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the face shield (14) is fitted to the helmet (11) via a 

pivot mechanism (35) which provides for a snap action of 
the face shield (14) either into its lowered (or 

operational) position or into its raised (or non-operational) 
position. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein the pivot 
mechanism (35) incorporates pivot elements (38,39) which 

during pivotal motion of the helmet (11) are caused to 
translate in position to enable the face shield in its 

raised position to retract over the front of the helmet 
(11). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5, wherein 
the fan (26) is energised by activation of an ON/OFF switch 

effected automatically by the face shield (14) in its 
movement between the operational and non-operational 

positions. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the face shield (14) self seals to the rim of the helmet 

(11) when in its operational position.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the repla
ceable battery and air filter components are 
replaceable modules to enable affixing of modules of different 

performance characteristics to the helmet (11).
