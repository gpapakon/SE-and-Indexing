<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor light emitting
device, and more precisely to a visible light emitting element
(semiconductor laser, light emitting diode, etc.), in particular
to the structure of a light emitting diode which has an
AlGaInP active layer formed by means of epitaxial growth on a
GaAs substrate.A light emitting diode in which a light emitting layer
portion consisting of an AlGaInP double heterojunction structure
is known to have a very high quantum efficiency, and has
been put into practical use as a high brightness visible light
emitting diode. The light emitting layer portion comprises an
AlGaInP active layer and first and second AlGaInP cladding 
layers which sandwich the active layer. These AlGaInP layers
have different composition ratios and are grown on a GaAs
substrate while lattice match is maintained.However, the energy of photons emitted from the AlGaInP
active layer is larger than the band gap of GaAs which constitutes
the substrate, hence the GaAs substrate acts as an
absorption layer for the emitted light. Therefore, the light
emitted toward the GaAs substrate is absorbed by the GaAs
substrate, leaving only the light emitted toward a light
extracting side to contribute to the brightness of the light
emitting diode, thus resulting in inefficient brightness.For the purpose of reducing absorption of the emitted light
by the GaAs substrate, there is a method in which a light
reflecting layer comprising alternately laminated layers with
different refractive indices is provided between the GaAs
substrate and the light emitting layer portion so that the
light emitted toward the GaAs substrate is reflected by the
light reflecting layer toward the light extracting side, so as
to improve the light extraction efficiency. The light reflecting
layer is generally formed by alternately laminating a large
number of layers with a high refractive index and layers with
a low refractive index wherein the optical thickness of each
layer is approximately 1/4 of the wavelength of the emitted
light. AlGaAs, AlGaInP, or a combination of these materials
have been used for the light reflecting layers. A light reflecting layer using AlwGa1-wAs is most widely used
partly because AlwGa1-wAs is in approximate lattice match with
GaAs. For example, a light reflecting layer formed by alternately
laminating Al0.6Ga0.4As layers and Al0.8Ga0.2As layers is
used in particular.Figure 3 shows a cross-sectional structure of a conventional
light emitting diode which has a light reflecting layer
