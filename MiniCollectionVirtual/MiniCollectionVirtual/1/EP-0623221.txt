<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for the detection of structural changes in solid bodies (10). The method detects electrical field strength changes generated by mechanical stresses in the material. This objective is achieved by means of a new design of probe (1) which comprises at least two different elements (2, 3) made from conducting material. One element (2) covers a large area and is mounted in the vicinity of the object to be measured. A second element (3), which has smaller dimensions than the first is installed in a void (4) in the body to be measured whilst being electrically insulated from it. The large area first probe element serves as a reference electrode, i.e. all potential changes in the smaller probe electrode are amplified and recorded against the potential in this electrode. A further enhancement in sensitivity is achieved by also installing the electronic amplification circuit (5) in the void (4) in the body to be measured (10). The method revealed and the corresponding measuring device are particularly suited for the recording of geoelectrical field changes and may thus be used for the prediction or evaluation of volcanic activity or earthquakes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a device for the 
detection of structural changes in solid bodies by the 
detection of electrical field strength changes generated 
by load changes, mechanical stresses, etc. in the 
material. The method revealed and the corresponding 
measuring device are particularly suited for the 
recording of geoelectrical field changes and may thus be 
used for the prediction or evaluation of volcanic 
activity or earthquakes. It is known that, in the event of load changes and the 
occurrence of internal mechanical stresses, solid bodies 
made from non-conducting or poorly conducting materials 
generate electrical field changes in their surroundings 
which may be recorded by sensitive measuring devices. 
These mechanical stresses frequently correlate with the 
origination of cracks or fractures within the body. By 
recording the field changes it is therefore possible to 
obtain information regarding structural changes such as 
material fatigue, deformation or crack formation. Special 
measures have to be taken to suppress interfering signals 
generated by the power supply network or transmitting 
stations, for instance, since the field changes occurring 
are only of a very low intensity. DE OS 4004170 reveals a method and measuring equipment 
for monitoring the occurrence or propagation of fractures 
or cracks in materials. Conducting sensor elements in 
various embodiments, appropriate for the subject of the  
 
measurement concerned, are specified for the detection of 
the electrical field changes. The signals generated in 
the sensors are amplified by a separate electronic circuit 
and then recorded by a recording unit. Various band 
pass filters are provided to reduce electrical interference. 
A frequency of 100 kHz is specified as the lower 
limit frequency. Lower frequency signals are completely 
suppressed in this equipment and therefore only relatively 
high frequency signals are recorded and evaluated. Another method and device specially for the measurement 
of electromagnetic waves generated by mechanical stresses 
in the earth's mantle, is revealed in US patent number 
4 837 582. In this method, a metallically conducting sensor 
is inserted deep in the earth (approximately 1000 m) 
as the antenna. The length of the probe is tuned to 1/4 
of the wavelength of geoelectrically generated waves in 
the frequency range around 3 kHz. The consequence of this 
complex arrangement is that only a tight frequency range 
is optimally captured by the antenna and that low
