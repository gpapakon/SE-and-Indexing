<ABSTRACT>
Device for dispensing a liquid product comprising a container (2) on the top of which is fitted a dispensing means (3) operated by being depressed, a cap (1) that fits over the dispensing means (3) and container (2), and an operating means (5) in the form of a lever which is hinged to the front of the cap (1) and enables said dispensing means (3) to be depressed when desired and thereby operated, said cap (1) also comprising on its front face a dispensing nozzle (4) supplied by a dispensing channel (15, 14) provided inside said cap (1) and having at least two end portions (15, 14), one (15) of which directly supplies the dispensing nozzle (4) while the other (14) extends axially. A connecting means (6) containing a passage (64) is provided between the dispensing means (3) and the other end (14) of the dispensing channel (15, 14) that extends axially. In order to depress and thereby operate said dispensing means (3), said operating means (5) acts upon said connecting means (6) which is connected leaktightly with the axial end (14) of the dispensing channel (14, 15), relative to which it is movable in the axial direction.

Device for dispensing a liquid product comprising 
a container (2, 102) equipped at its upper part with a 

dispensing member (3) which can be actuated by being 
depressed, a cap (1, 101) capping the dispensing member 

(3) and the container (2, 102), an actuating member (5, 
105) in the form of a lever being articulated on the 

front of the cap (1, 101), the said actuating member (5, 
105) making it possible, as desired, to carry out the 

depression action necessary for the operation of the said 
dispensing member (3), the said cap (1, 101) also including 

on its front face a dispensing nozzle (4, 104) fed by 
a dispensing duct (15, 14) provided in the said cap (1, 

101) and having at least two end portions (15, 14) one 
(15) of which directly feeds the dispensing nozzle (4, 

104) and the other (14) of which extends axially, a 
connecting means (6) equipped with a passage (64) being 

provided between the dispensing member (3) and the other 
end (14) of the dispensing duct (15, 14) which extends 

axially, the said actuating member (5, 105) interacting 
with the said connecting means (6) to carry out the 

depression action necessary for the operation of the said 
dispensing member (3), characterized in that the connecting 

means (6) is connected in a leaktight manner to the 
axial end (14) of the dispensing duct (14, 15) with 

respect to which it can move axially. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the connecting means (6) includes at its upper part 

a cylindrical fitting (63) mounted so that it can slide 
in a leaktight manner in the axial end (14) with  

 
corresponding section of the dispensing duct (15, 14). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the connecting means (6) includes at its 

lower end a cylindrical housing (65) with which the 
dispensing member (3) interacts in a leaktight manner, 

and in axial abutment. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the dispensing member (3) is a pump mounted on the 

upper part of the container (2), and the operating rod 
(31) of which is snugly fitted into the cylindrical 

housing (65) of the connecting means (6). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the dispensing member is a valve mounted on the 

upper part of the container (102), and the operating rod 
(131) of which is snugly fitted into the cylindrical 

housing (65) of the connecting means (6). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the connecting means (6) includes a 

circular flange (62) with which the actuating member (5, 
105), in the form of a lever, interacts. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the lever (5) bears two cams (52) interacting with 

the flange (62). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the said cams have a profile (53) of involute shape, 

these involutes being centred on the hinge (51) of the 
lever (5), the lowest points of each of the profiles (53) 

of the cam (52), on contact with the flange (62), being 
situated in the same plane, which passes through the axis 

of the operating rod (31) and of the connecting means 
(6). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the actuating member (5) is articulated 

on the front of the cap (1) by means of a film hinge 
(51), the actuating member (5) and the cap (1) being 

formed integrally together by moulding. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the actuating member (5) is articulated 

on the front of the cap (1) by means of a hinge, the  
 

actuating member (5) and the cap (1) being produced as 
two separate pieces. 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 10, 
characterized in that the cylindrical fitting (63) of the 

connecting means (6) bears a sealing lip (66) formed 
integrally by moulding with the connecting means (6). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the dispensing member (3) is 

mounted offcentred with respect to the longitudinal axis 
of the container (2), means of angular orientation being 

provided for positioning the cap (1) relative to the 
dispensing member (3) and therefore to the container (2). 
Device according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the orientation means consist of the shape of the 

cross-section of the container (2) and of the cap (1). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the dispensing member is centred on 

the longitudinal axis of the container (102).
