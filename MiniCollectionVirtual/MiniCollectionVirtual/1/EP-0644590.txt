<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor substrate (11) has concavities 
(14) and convexities (13) at an upper surface thereof, 

and silica particles (granular insulators) (15) are 
provided in the concavities to planarize the entire 

upper surface of the semiconductor substrate (11). 
First, the silica particles (15) are laid over an upper 

surface of a semiconductor substrate (11) to provide 
the granular insulators (15) in concavities (14) in the 

upper surface of the semiconductor substrate (11), and 
the silica particles (15) provided on convexities (13) 

on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate 
(11) are removed. The concavities (14) are thus buried 

with the silica particles (15) so as to improve global 
planarizarion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor
devices including a semiconductor substrate with
stepwise differences on the upper surface thereof, and
to methods for fabricating such semiconductor devices.Semiconductor devices of high integration, such as
LSIs, VLSIs, etc., generally have a so-called multi-wiring
layer structure having an n-th wiring layer
formed by providing one or more wiring portions in a
layer on a substrate, and further an n+1-th wiring
layer formed through an insulating layer.Insulating layers, or inter-layer insulating
layers, included in such multi-wiring layer structures
have the intrinsic purpose of providing insulation
between upper and lower layers (between a substrate and
an adjacent wiring layer or between two adjacent wiring
layers), and in addition the purpose of covering
smoothly the rough substrate or wiring layers having
stepwise differences on the upper surface thereof so as
to provide a more planar surface (planarization).In this respect, as integration of semiconductor
integrated circuits is improved, steps on surfaces of
formed devices may be large, and wires may have to be
thickened to compensate for lower wiring capacities due
to the reduced size (micronization) of the wiring.
Taking it into consideration that steps resulting from
such wiring tend to be larger, it is necessary to
ensure planarization of inter-film insulating films in
forming multi-layer wirings.This is because, if an inter-layer insulating film
permits roughness of a lower layer (a substrate or a
lower wiring layer) to be still present in an upper
layer, there is a risk that breakage and/or defective
insulation will occur at a wiring portion in the upper
layer, and a margin of a focal depth of a resist in the 
wiring will be adversely narrowed, and integration of
the wiring may be impaired.Previously-considered methods for forming an
inter-layer insulating film include: a method (a) for
forming an SiO2 film on the surface of a substrate by
CVD using a compound gas, such as SiH4 or others, a
method (b) for forming a CVD film using ozone-TEOS
(tetraethoxy silane), a method (c) for forming an SOG
(spin on glass) film by solving SiOx in a solvent, such
as alcohol or others, and applying the SiOx to the
surface of a substrate, and other methods.But in the method (a), roughness of a wiring
itself is still present in an upper layer. A problem
with the method (a) is that a formed inter-layer
insulating film has very poor planarization.In the above-described methods (b) and (c),
roughness in a region
