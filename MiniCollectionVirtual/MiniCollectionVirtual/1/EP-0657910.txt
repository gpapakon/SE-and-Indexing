<ABSTRACT>
A high voltage current limiting device (1) encases a surface modified 
pulverulent arc-quenching filler composition (40) where, gas-evolving material (46) is 

bound by a binder (44) to the surfaces of the arc-quenching filler (42). The pulverulent 
arc-quenching filler (42) can be selected from the group of silicas and silicates, 

preferably sand, mica or quartz. The gas-evolving materials (46) can be selected from 
the group of melamine, cyanuric acid, melamine cyanurate, guanidine, guanidine 

carbonate, guanidine acetate, 1,3-diphenylguanidine, guanine, urea, urea phosphate, 

hydantoin, allantoin, and mixtures and derivatives thereof. The high voltage current 
limiting device (1) has a generally tubular casing of electrically insulating material (30), 

terminal elements (32) closing the opposite ends of the casing, at least one fuse element 
(20) conductively interconnecting the terminal elements, a core (10) for supporting the 

fuse element, extending parallel to the longitudinal axis, and a modified pulverulent 
arc-quenching filler material (40) inside the casing, in close proximity to the fuse 

element. The modified pulverulent arc-quenching filler material (40) includes a 
pulverulent arc-quenching filler (42), a binder (44), and a gas-evolving material (46), 

and the gas-evolving material is bound to the surfaces of the arc-quenching filler.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of high voltage circuit interruption in electrical
devices such as switchgear, transformers, and the like, and in particular concerns high
voltage current limiting fuses or expulsion fuses, circuit breakers. circuit interrupters,
separable cable connectors, or the like, including a pulverulent arc-quenching filler
material of high dielectric strength that is adapted to aid in arc extinction, and to
quickly and effectively to break the circuit. More particularly, the invention is directed
to an arc-quenching filler material encased within a high voltage current limiting device
that is surface modified with a gas-evolving composition to provide improved arc-quenching
properties without impairing the free flowing and compacting properties of
the arc-quenching filler material. The invention also concerns a method of making the
same.Current limiting power interruption in high voltage circuits requires a current
interruption device that rapidly and effectively brings the current to a zero value upon
the occurrence of a line fault. The fuse devices generally considered herein are those
employed in electrical circuits typically at voltages of a thousand or more volts.
Electrical circuits operating at such high levels of voltage can cause extensive damage
to circuit components, machinery connected to the circuit, or the like if the current
interruption is not accomplished positively in a short period following the occurrence
of fault or overload conditions. Expulsion fuses or gas-evolving fuses in particular have been used extensively
for high voltage circuit interruption in switchgear, transformers, and other electrical
equipment. It is generally known that arc-quenching and gas-evolving materials in such
a circuit interruption device, positioned in contact with the fuse element, aid in, inter
alia, deionizing, cooling, and thereby quenching the electric arc created under fault or
overload current conditions.It is known to provide a pulverulent (powder) arc-quenching filler material, for
example sand, inside the casing of a fuse to absorb the energy of a burning or fusing
fuse element during the fusing process so that the fuse will not explode when
interrupting the circuit. The conventional arc-quenching filler material tends to confine
the arc radially and thus to sustain its current limiting voltage, in addition to absorbing
the energy of the arc. However, such fuse when operating under low current
conditions may arc for an extended period if time during which the sand or
