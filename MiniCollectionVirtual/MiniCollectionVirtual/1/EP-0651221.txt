<ABSTRACT>
Restrictions on the major dimension of flattened tubes 
used in heat exchangers employing oval shaped, two piece 

headers/tank assemblies can be minimized in a construction 
including a plurality of flattened tubes (14) each having a 

minor dimension and a major dimension transverse thereto and 
extending in spaced parallel relation. Fins (16) are in heat 

exchange relation with the tubes (14) and a pair of spaced, 
parallel, elongated headers/tank assemblies (10, 12) are 

provided between which the tubes (14) extend. At least one of 

the headers/tank assemblies (10, 12) is a multiple piece 
header/tank assembly including a header piece (20) and a 

separate tank piece (22). The header piece (20) is elongated 
and provided with a plurality of slots (28) sized to receive 

ends of the tubes (14) with the tube major dimensions being 
generally transverse to the direction of elongation of the 

header piece (20). The header piece further includes a 
peripheral flange (24). The tank piece (22) is elongated, 

concave and has a peripheral flange (44) nested within the 
peripheral flange (22) of the header piece (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat exchanger comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1. Such heat exchangers having a
combined header and tank
construction are usable in moderately high pressure
applications as, for example, cooling systems including
high pressure radiators, and air conditioners condensers
and/or evaporators in vehicles.Recent years have seen an almost unanimous
switch from conventional heat exchangers in vehicles to
those of the so called parallel flow type as exemplified in
US-A-4,998,580. This type of a
heat exchanger has a number of advantages over more
conventional types, such as being lightweight and having a
low internal volume. When used in two phase heat exchange
operations and provided with flow passages who hydraulic
diameters (as conventionally defined) are 1.8 mm (0.070
inches) or less, high heat exchange efficiency is also
obtained.One feature of such heat exchangers that is
responsible for their relatively light weight and low
charge volume is use of a combined header and tank. As
disclosed in the exemplary embodiment in US-A-4 998 580
cylindrical tubes serve as both headers and tanks. One
side of the tube is slotted to receive the ends of
flattened tubes which extend partly into the interior and
are typically brazed in place to seal the flattened tube-slot 
interface and provide a secure assembly. The resulting
low weights are highly desirable in vehicular installations
because the lesser weight ultimately means that less energy
will be required to propel the vehicle; and that, in turn,
translates into fuel savings.Another advantage that may be associated with heat
exchangers of this type is the fact that their profile is
relatively small as compared to conventional heat exchangers.
For example, the use of the combined header and tank
constructions shown in US-A-4 998 580 result in a heat exchanger having a
lesser dimension measured transverse to the direction of
elongation of the header/tank assembly than would be the case
if conventional headers were used. This allows such a heat
exchanger to be more readily situated in modern vehicles
wherein aerodynamics are critical to achieving better fuel
economy. Stated another way, because of the somewhat smaller
profile afforded by these type of heat exchangers, it is
easier to obtain aerodynamic "slipperiness" in a vehicle,
particularly the front end of the vehicle, where the heat
exchanger is being utilized as a condenser or radiator.As noted above, in the exemplary embodiment disclosed in
US-A-4 998 580, the combined

<CLAIMS>
A heat exchanger comprising

a plurality of flattened tubes (14), each having
a minor dimension and a major dimension transverse

thereto, extending in spaced parallel relation;
fins (16) between and in heat exchange relation
with said tubes; and
a pair of spaced parallel elongated headers/tank
assemblies (10,12) between which said tubes extend, at

least one of said headers/tank assemblies being a multiple
piece header including a header piece (20) and a separate

tank piece 922), said header piece being elongated and
having a plurality of slots (28) sized to receive ends of

said tubes with the tube major dimensions being generally
transverse to the direction of elongation of said header

piece, said header piece further including a peripheral
flange (24), said tank piece being elongated, concave and

having a peripheral flange (44) nested within the
peripheral flange (24) of said header piece and bonded

thereto to form a unitary tubular structure, characterised
in that the peripheral flange (44) of the tank piece has

alternating crests (52) and valleys (50); said valleys
having a width greater than said tube minor dimension and

being aligned with said tube ends;
whereby flow to said tubes is not obstructed by
said tank piece peripheral flange (44) because of the

valleys therein being aligned with said tube ends to
provide reliefs therefor.
The heat exchanger of Claim 1 wherein said
crests (52) abut said header piece.
The heat exchanger of Claim 2 wherein said
crests (52) and valleys (50) define a castellated edge on

said tank piece peripheral flange.
The heat exchanger of Claim 1 wherein said
valleys (50) are such that at least a few fortieths of a 

millimetre (a few thousandths of an inch) clearance exits
between the tube ends.
The heat exchanger of Claim 1 wherein there are
convex domes (40) in the form of continuous compound

curves between each of said slots (28) along the length of
said header piece.
The heat exchanger of Claim 1 wherein said slots
(28) extend substantially completely between opposite

parts of said header piece peripheral flange.
The heat exchanger of Claim 1 wherein said
headers/tank assemblies are of generally oval cross

section.
The heat exchanger of Claim 1 wherein said
header and tank pieces, said fins and said tubes are

brazed together.
