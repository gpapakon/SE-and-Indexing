<ABSTRACT>
A clamping device for connecting machine spindles or basic supports to tool holders or tools for chip-removal machining comprises two opening clamps (38, 40: 138, 140) which are guided so as to be radially movable in a holder (24; 124) anchored in the machine spindle (10, 110) or the basic support and, in the open position, engage behind a circumferential clamping shoulder inside the tool holder (12; 112). The clamps (38, 40; 138, 140) extend transversely to the longitudinal direction of the tool holder (12; 112) and have clamping surfaces (48, 50, 52, 54; 148, 150, 152, 154) on the laterally outer ends which are arranged in such a way that a total of four clamping surfaces of the two clamps (38, 40; 138, 140) are distributed around the periphery of the clamping shoulder at angular intervals of 90 .

Clamping device for connecting machine 
spindles or base holders to machining tool-holders 

or tools, with two clamping elements (38, 40; 138, 
140) which can be spread out and are guided for 

moving radially in a support (24; 124) anchored in 
the machine spindle (10; 110) or in the base 

holder and which, in the spread-out position, 
engage behind a circular clamping shoulder inside 

the tool-holder (12; 112), 
characterized in that
 
the clamping elements (38, 40; 138; 140) extend 

transverse the longitudinal direction of the tool 
holder (12; 112) and, on the laterally outer ends, 

have clamping surfaces (48, 50, 52, 54; 148, 150, 
152, 154) arranged in a manner such that, 

altogether, four clamping surfaces of the two 
clamping elements (38, 40; 138, 140) are 

distributed at respective angular spacings of 
approximately 90Â° on the circumference of the 

clamping shoulder. 
Clamping device according to Claim 1, 

characterized in
 the clamping elements (38, 40) 
have holes with opposed threads housing portions 

of a differential threaded screw (36) having 
opposed threads.  

 
Clamping device according to Claim 2, 

characterized in that
 the differential threaded 
screw (36) has, at one end, an engagement device 

for a rotating tool, and in that radial holes (42, 
44) are provided in the machine spindle (10) and 

in the tool holder (12) and extend from the 
differential threaded screw (36) in alignment with 

one another. 
Clamping device according to any one of 
the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the 
clamping elements (38, 40) are guided for movement 

in opposed cavities (30, 32) of a substantially 
cylindrical support (24). 
Clamping device according to Claim 4, 

characterized in that
 the clamping elements 
(38, 40) have inclined surfaces (62) on the radial 

surfaces facing towards the tool holder (12), and 
in that pins (56, 58) movable longitudinally on 

parallel axes in the support extend into the 
cavities (30, 32) at one end and are struck by the 

inclined surfaces (62) during the drawing-together 
of the clamping elements (38, 40), whereas the 

other ends of the pins (56, 58) abut an inner base 
(64) of the tool holder (12).  

 
Clamping device according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that
 a rotatable cam (200) with 
two opposed cam surfaces (202, 204) is disposed 

between the clamping elements for spreading out 
the clamping elements (138, 140). 
Clamping device according to Claim 6, 

characterized in that
 at least two radially 
projecting claws (212, 214) are connected to the 

cam (200) and enter undercut cavities (216, 218) 
on the inner side of the clamping elements (138, 

140) in a manner such that they exert a radially 
inwardly-directed pulling action on the clamping 

elements when the cam (200) is released. 
Clamping device according to Claim 6 or 
Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the clamping 
elements (138, 140) are guided for radial movement 

in a recess of the support (124), and in that the 

recess is bridged on both end faces of the cam 
(200) by plates (220, 222) which are connected to 

the support (124) at both ends and support the 
cams (200) rotatably in the central region. 
Clamping device according to Claim 7 or 
Claim 8, 
characterized in that
, at least one 
inclined surface (228) connected to the tool 

holder (112) is formed in the path of movement of  
 

one of the cam surfaces (202, 204) of the cam 
(200) and is struck by the cam surface when the 

clamping elements are released, thus ejecting the 
tool holder. 
Clamping device according to Claim 9, 

characterized in that
 the inclined surface is 
formed on the head of a pin (228) projecting from 

the tool holder (112). 
Clamping device according to any one of 
Claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that
 at least one 
end of the cam has an engagement device (210) for 

the application of a tool, and in that radial 
holes (142, 144) are provided in the machine 

spindle (110) and in the tool holder (112) and 
extend axially from the cam in alignment with one 

another.
