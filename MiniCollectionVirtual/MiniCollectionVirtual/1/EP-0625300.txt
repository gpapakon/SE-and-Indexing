<ABSTRACT>
In a method for installing or removing modules or elements in a panel structure, especially for installing display modules (3) in a large screen, the modules are mounted in a lattice formed by orthogonally crossing chords (6, 7) which can be moved in a horizontal and vertical direction in a frame structure (1, 2) in which the chords are fitted. A panel structure wherein the method is used, consists of a lattice of orthogonally crossing chords (6, 7) fitted in a frame structure (1, 2) in which a carrier device (2) consisting of movable sections (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) is arranged to give the chords (6, 7) a horizontal or vertical displacement Hs, Vs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for assembling of modules or 
elements in a panel structure, especially for assembling of 
display modules in a large screen according to the introduction of 
claim 1. The invention also concerns a method for assembling modules or 
elements in a panel structure, by means of the device and 
according to the introduction of claim 9. Typical examples of panel structures of the kind described in 
the introduction are large screens for displaying television 
broadcasts or video film, where the large screen is composed of 
a number of display modules, each of which shows a section of 
the television or video picture. Each individual module 
therefore constitutes an independent television or video 
receiver and can be based on, for example, cathode ray tubes or 
large LCD modules. The panel structure according to the present 
invention may, however, also be in the form of large screens of 
a different kind, e.g. module-based light panels for 
advertising and information purposes or module-based solar 
panels which are linked together. In the case of such module-based 
panel structures, where the individual modules have some 
kind of electrical connection, there will be a frequent need to 
replace individual modules, e.g. for maintenance or repair of 
faults. The replacement should preferably be able to be 
performed while the panel structure, i.e. e.g. the large 
screen, is in operation, and without the necessity of 
disconnecting or removing other modules which do not require to 
be replaced. This means that assembling and disassambling of 
the modules should preferably be able to be performed from the 
back of the panel structure or screen. From prior art, e.g. US-A-5,079,636, there are known panel 
structures composed of modules, where the panel structure's  
 
designed as a rigid, e.g., rectangular frame and the individual 
modules are fitted in the frame, a lattice-like device, which 
is secured in the frame, being used for this purpose. In this 
connection assembling or disassembling of the modules usually 
has to be performed from the front of the frame and often 
involves a considerable amount of work, which again results in 
the assembly and disassembly work becoming both time-consuming 
and expensive. An additional factor is that, in order to support the weight of 
the display modules while simultaneously permitting the 
assembling and disassembling, the frame and lattice are 
designed with dimensions which cause the weight of the panel 
structure over and above the

<CLAIMS>
A device for assembling or disassembling of modules or 
elements in a panel structure, especially for assembling or 

disassembling of display modules in a large screen, where the 
large screen comprises a frame structure with a first rectangular 

frame (1), which defines the format of the panel or 
screen, consisting of two horizontal sides and two vertical 

sides respectively,

which are movable in relation to one another, that in the 
second frame's movable sections (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) there is 

fitted a lattice consisting of orthogonal chords (6, 7), a 
single opening in the lattice formed between a pair of 

respectively horizontal and vertical, orthogonally crossing 
chords (6, 7) defining the installation point for an individual 

module (3), in addition that the chords (6, 7) are passed 
through the first frame (1) in movable connection with and 

attached in movable abutment against the first frame (1), so 
that any load on the chords (6, 7) is entirely supported by the 

abutment against the first frame, that there are provided 
openings (4, 5) of varying length in the first and the second 

frame respectively, the length of the openings (4) in the first 
frame (1) being inversely proportional to the length of the 

corresponding openings (5) in the second frame (2) and the 
chords (6, 7) in the lattice are passed through these openings 

(4, 5) for fastening in the frames (1, 2), that the openings 
(4) in the first frame (1) for the chords (6

through the centre of the lattice have the least length and the 

corresponding openings in the second frame (2) the greatest 
length, and that the openings in the first frame (1) for the 

chords (6

sides have the greatest length and the corresponding openings 

in the second frame (2) the least length. 
A device according to claim 1,

in rigid sleeves (9) which are passed through the holes (4, 5) 

in the first (1) and the second frame (2) respectively for
