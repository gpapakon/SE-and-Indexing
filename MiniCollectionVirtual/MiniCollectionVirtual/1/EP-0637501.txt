<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for joining sheets of plastics comprising: a 
sliding track (5,6) that extends horizontally in a first 

direction (X); means (4,43) for positioning the sheets 
(46,47) so that the borders of the flaps to be joined are 

aligned, mutually adjacent and mutually parallel; a 
stitching device and a welding device that are both movable 

along the track (5,6) and are suitable to form the joint by 
producing stitching and welding lines along the borders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
joining sheets, particularly sheets of reinforced plastics 
for producing tensile structures. As is known, sheets of reinforced plastics, for 
example constituted by a polyester net embedded in a layer 
of PVC, are used to produce tensile structures. Such sheets 
may be very large and their joining requires the execution 
of welds reinforced with stitching lines which are mostly 
produced manually, with a great expenditure of time and 
labor. The principal aim of the present invention is to 
provide an apparatus that allows to obviate the above 
drawbacks of the known art, especially as regards the 
possibility of supporting and handling large sheets during 
joining operations. This aim is achieved with an apparatus for joining 
sheets of plastics characterized in that it comprises: a 
sliding track that lies horizontally in a direction X; 
means for positioning the sheets so that the borders to be 
joined are aligned and mutually adjacent; a stitching 
device and a welding device that are both movable along 
said track and suitable to form the joint by producing 
stitching and welding lines along said border. Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following detailed 
description of a preferred embodiment, illustrated only by 
way of non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, 
wherein:  figure 1 is a schematic elevation view of an apparatus 
according to the present invention; figure 2 is a plan view of the apparatus of figure 1; figure 3 is a perspective view of the stitching 
device; figure 4 is a bottom perspective view of the device of 
figure 3; and figures 5 and 6 are views of two types of joint. With reference to the above figures, the reference 
numeral 1 designates the frame of the apparatus, which 
comprises a base or footing 2 that extends lengthwise and a 
wall 3 which rises from a longitudinal edge of said 
footing. A ledge 4 protrudes from the upper edge of the 
wall 3 in the direction that lies opposite to the footing 2 
and forms a supporting surface for the sheets to be joined 
whose structure will be clarified hereinafter. Two rails 5 and 6 are fixed on the footing 2 and form 
a sliding track for a stitching device 7 and a welding 
device 8. The welding device 8 is preferably of the type that 
can perform high-frequency welding, constituted for example 
by a welding machine equipped with a high-frequency welding 
bar manufactured by the company GEAF S.r.l. located at 
Cal

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for joining sheets of plastics, 
characterized in that it comprises: a sliding track (5, 6) 

that lies horizontally in a first direction (X); means (4, 
43) for positioning the sheets (46, 47) so that the borders 

to be joined are aligned, mutually adjacent and mutually 
parallel; a stitching device (7) and a welding device (8) 

that are both movable along said track (5, 6) and are 
suitable to form the joint by producing stitching (53) and 

welding (52) lines along said borders. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said sliding track (5, 6) is arranged on a footing (2) 

of a frame (1) that comprises a wall (3) which is 
surmounted by a horizontal ledge (4), and in that said 

stitching device (7) comprises a first slider (9) that is 
slideable on said track (5, 6) in said first direction (X) 

and a second slider (21) that is slideable along said first 
slider (9) in a second direction (Y) that is at right 

angles to said first direction (X), a stitching machine 
(33, 34) being mounted on said second slider (21) and 

having a working surface that is co-planar with respect to 
said ledge. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in 
that it comprises a stationary channel (42) that extends in 

said first direction (X) above said second slider (21) and 
has a ledge (43) which is co-planar to the working surface 

of said stitching machine (33, 34), said channel (42) being 
suitable to receive one of the sheets to be joined. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in 
 

that said stitching device (7) is actuated along said track 
(5, 6) by an electric motor (18) which has a pinion that 

meshes with a rack (20) associated with said track. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said channel (42) rests on a roller (45) which is 

rotatably mounted on said second slider (21) at right 
angles to said first direction (X). 
Apparatus according to claim 3 or 5, characterized 
in that said channel (42) rests on the ground by means of a 

plurality of legs which are articulated so as to lift when 
the stitching (7) and welding (8) devices pass and so as to 

return to the resting position as soon as said devices have 
passed. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that said positioning means comprise, in 

addition to said ledges (4, 43), two grip elements which 
are arranged so as to grip the opposite ends of said sheets 

(46, 47) at the borders to be joined, said grip elements 
being movable mutually apart in order to stretch said 

borders. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said welding device (8) is 

constituted by a welding machine with a high-frequency 
welding bar and is suitable to advance stepwise with 

strokes whose length is substantially equal to the length 
of the bar.
