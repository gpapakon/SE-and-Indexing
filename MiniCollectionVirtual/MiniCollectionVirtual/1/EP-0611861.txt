<ABSTRACT>
Key profile for the key of a lock cylinder. This key profile, when considered in the axial direction from the key tip (S) to the key grip (G), has a letter sequence with letters W and H. One of the letters is designed as a capital letter and the other as a small letter. The capital letter is nearer the key spine (R) and the small letter nearer the key breast. The individual profile regions (RN, BN and Z) are designed in such a way that, even when there are profile variations, in the region of similarity the respective letter sequence remains recognisable and the stability of the key is not impaired.
