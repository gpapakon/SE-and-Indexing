<ABSTRACT>
A fast drying traffic paint which includes at least 0.1% by weight, based on the weight 
of the paint composition, of fibres is disclosed. The paint exhibits reduced cracking 

during drying. 
A method for reducing the degree of surface cracking in a fast drying traffic paint 
during drying is also disclosed. The method comprises incorporating into the paint at 

least 0.1% by weight, based on the weight of the paint composition, of fibres. 
Use of at least 0.1% by weight, based on the weight of the paint composition, of fibres 
in a fast drying traffic paint to reduce the degree of surface cracking during drying of 

the paint is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fast drying aqueous traffic (road marking) paints.As used herein the term "fast drying" means a traffic paint having a dry-through
time of less than 120 minutes at 23°C in conditions of no air flow and 90%
relative humidity. Dry-through is defined by ASTM D-1640-83 with the modification
that no thumb pressure is exerted.Modern traffic paints are designed to dry rapidly at their surface, so that
vehicles can drive across the paint only a few minutes after its application without
picking any up on their tyres, and can be of two general types: melt-applied and fast-drying
aqueous paint compositions. The present invention is concerned solely with
the latter.Relatively thick applications (thicker, when wet, than about 450 µm) of
fast drying aqueous traffic paints tend to suffer from 'mud-cracking', which is the
formation of cracks or channels within the paint film as it dries. The mud-cracking
is believed to occur because the surface of the paint dries first, and then as the rest
of the paint dries, it shrinks. The cracks have detrimental effects on the performance
of the paints as road markings, particularly with regard to dirt retention and the
consequent reduction in daylight visibility of the paint.One known way to help reduce the mud-cracking is to add larger particulate
fillers, such as quartz or silica particles. However, relatively large amounts of such
additives (often about 30% by weight) are required, and this can have a detrimental
effect on other properties of the paint. For instance, quartz itself can cause yellowing
of the paint; other problems include sedimentation of the additive during storage, an
undesirable roughness in the dried paint, and also a reduction in flexibility of the 
dried paint. Thus there is a need for a means of reducing the degree of cracking
during drying of fast drying aqueous traffic paints which does not require the
addition of large quantities of particulate additives.EP-A-0 525 977 discloses a waterborne paint which is fast drying, but not a
traffic paint.JP-A-82 35144 discloses the use of glass fibre and asbestos in a slow drying
paint to improve resistance to weather, water and abrasion after it has dried.JP-A-63 179978 and JP-A-63 170478 also disclose the use of glass fibre in
a slow drying paint to improve its durability after it has dried.In JP-A-62 100563 a traffic paint is disclosed containing from 0.5 to 5.0% by
weight of metal fibres, but this is a melt applied traffic paint not a fast drying
aqueous paint.None of this art deals
