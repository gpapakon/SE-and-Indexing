<ABSTRACT>
A structure of controlled water resistance comprises a core of material having mechanical strength when dry but not when water-wet and a coating comprising biodegradable water resistant polymer. The polymer is preferably applied to the core by electrostatic coating of dry fine particles as laid down in microorganism cells or as clusters of such particles. The structure is useful in the form of disposable biodisintegrable articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a process for making a
structure comprising a core of a material having mechanical
strength when dry but not when water-wet and a coating
comprising biodegradable water-resistant polymer.WO 91/13207 describes the production of such structures
by applying a latex comprising a colloidal suspension in
water of essentially non-crystalline particles of a polymer
or copolymer to paper or board substrates by dipping or
spraying. The process of the present invention involves the
electrostatic application of dry fine particles rather than
the application of a latex.The process of the present invention is a process for
making a structure comprising a core of a material having
mechanical strength when dry but not when water-wet and a
coating comprising water-resistant polymer by electrostatic
application of dry fine particles of such polymer, in which
process
(a) the polymer is a biodegradable microbiologically
produced polyhydroxyalkanoate consisting of
repeating units of formula O-R-CO where R is an
aliphatic chain of 2 to 6 carbon atoms optionally
carrying a C1-C4 branch on the carbon atom next to
oxygen; and(b) the dry fine particles of polymer are particles as
laid down in microorganism cells or clusters of
such particles, in each case after removal of cell
debris.The process of the present invention may also provide 
compound structures in which two or more
structures are laminated together or in which core material or
other material is laminated to the structure.The core can be for example a foam or assemblage of
particles or assemblage of fibres or any combination of these.
Such fibres are preferably naturally occurring, rather than man
made. The core thus could be bread-like or paper or papier-maché
or felt or candyfloss-like. It may include one or more
water-sensitive and/or biodegradable adhesives. There may be
water-resistant material mixed in with water-disintegrable
material, provided the proportion thereof is insufficient to
decrease water-sensitivity below the level required for the
intended use of the structure.The coating can be, or can be convertible by heat
treatment to, for example a smooth fused or sintered film
covering the whole surface of the core, or a reticulated film
following the contours of the core, or both. It can be
limited, for example to the surfaces of the units (such as
fibres) of which the core is composed, or to junctions between
such units. The coating can be of thickness in the range 5 to
500 preferably 20 to 200 µm, for example. The coating of
