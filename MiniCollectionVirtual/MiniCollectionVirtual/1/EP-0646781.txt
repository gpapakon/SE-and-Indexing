<ABSTRACT>
For testing the tightness of the gas withdrawal system of a gas analysis device, the gas withdrawal system is sealed, the measuring gas pump is switched on for a period which is safely sufficient to achieve the maximum underpressure. During this time, a flow meter measures the flow. The pump is then switched off and is switched on again after a predetermined time. In the event of a leak, the gas which has penetrated into the withdrawal system is conveyed so that the flow meter determines a flow. By means of comparing the amplitudes of the two flow meter signals it can be established whether and to what magnitude a leak is present. The invention is applied in vehicle exhaust gas measuring devices.

Method for testing the tightness of the gas-sampling
system of a gas-analysing device having a

sampling probe (ES) and a measurement-gas pump (GP),
which leads the measurement gas from the sampling probe

(ES) to an analyser cell (AN), characterised in that,
at normal pressure, the gas-sampling system is sealed,

the measurement-gas pump (GP) is switched on and a
signal (I) emitted by a flow meter (DF), which is used

for measuring the flow of measurement gas that is
supplied to the analyser cell (AN), is registered, in

that the measurement-gas pump (GP) is then switched off
and is switched on again after a predetermined waiting

time (T), and a signal (II) which is thereby emitted by
the flow meter (DF) is detected, and in that by

comparison of the two signals (I, II), the tightness of
the gas-sampling system is determined.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the amplitudes (S1, S2) of the two signals (I, II)

are compared with each other.
Arrangement for testing the tightness of the
gas-sampling system of a gas-analysing device having a

sampling probe (ES), a measurement-gas pump (GP), which
draws in the measurement gas through the sampling probe

(ES) and conveys it to an analyser cell (AN), and
having means for sealing the gas-sampling system,

characterised by means which are able to switch on the
measurement-gas pump (GP) in the case of normal

pressure and a sealed gas-sampling system, then switch
it off, and switch it on again after a predetermined

waiting time (T), means for registering a signal (I)
emitted, when the measurement-gas pump (GP) is switched

on for the first time, by a flow meter (DF), which is
used for measuring the flow of measurement gas that is

supplied to the analyser cell (AN), and an evaluating
device (AW) for determining the tightness of the gas-sampling 

system by comparison of the registered signal
(I) and a signal (II) which is emitted by the flow

meter (DF) when the measurement-gas pump (GP) is
switched on again.
Arrangement according to claim 3,
characterised in that the flow meter (DF) is arranged

in the flow path of the measurement gas, downstream of
the measurement-gas pump (GP).
Arrangement according to claim 4,
characterised in that the flow meter (DF) is arranged

outside the sealable sampling system.
Arrangement according to one of the claims 3
to 5, characterised in that the measurement-gas pump

(GP) is arranged at the measurement-gas outlet of the
sampling system.
Arrangement according to claim 6,
characterised in that a non-return valve (RV1) is

connected to the measurement-gas pump (GP).
