<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a measuring device for a fluid, in particular for feedback control of pumps, comprising a pressure sensor fitted with detection elements allowing pressure measurement and a flow-rate sensor fitted with detection elements allowing flow-rate measurement. These various known pressure and flow-rate sensors require particular positioning with relatively complex seals each time they are used. Integration of the sensors into mass-produced measuring devices requires a high level of qualification. The measuring device according to the invention is characterised in that the pressure sensor and the flow-rate sensor include one and the same mechanical body 1, around which they are arranged.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for measuring the pressure and flow rate
of a liquid, comprising a pressure sensor provided with

detecting means which make it possible to measure
pressure and a flow rate sensor provided with detecting

means which make it possible to measure flow rate, the
pressure sensor and the flow rate sensor comprising the

same mechanical body, the detecting means for measuring
the flow rate consisting of a pair of thermistors (4),

one of which is temporarily heated, the other being kept
at the temperature of the liquid,

wherein the detecting means for measuring pressure
consist of a support (3) to which the pressure of the

liquid is transmitted through a resilient elastomeric
membrane (10) which undergoes displacement when it is

subjected to the pressure of the liquid, and means for
measuring the displacement,

the body (1) supports, on its part facing the liquid, an
end piece (2) made of elastomer including said membrane

(10) through which the pressure of the liquid is
transferred integrally to the support (3) and the end

piece (2) is penetrated by thermistors (4) with offset
probes placed in housings (5) in the liquid which is to

be measured.
Measuring apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the end piece (2) has two local thickened portions in

the form of sleeves (6) ensuring a tight seal around the
housings (5) by initial clamping.
Measuring apparatus according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the detecting means for

measuring pressure consist of a support (3) and a bridge
of piezo-resistant gauges (12-14). 
Measuring apparatus according to claim 1, which is
used in an apparatus for controlling a water supply

installation.
