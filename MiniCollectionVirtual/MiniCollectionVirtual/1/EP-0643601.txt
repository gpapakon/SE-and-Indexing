<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catheter having a
needle electrode for radiofrequency ablation and more
particularly to such a catheter for radiofrequency
ablation of the myocardium of the heart.Radiofrequency ablation is being utilised in an
attempt to eliminate arrhythmias in the heart by
creating lesions in the myocardium of the heart.
However it has been found that is has been difficult
to create lesions which are large enough and deep
enough, particularly in some areas of the heart, as
for example in the ventricle where the apex may be as
thick as 1cm and in which aberrant pathway that is
causing the arrythmia may be on the epicardial side of
the myocardium rather than on the endocardial side.
With the present techniques being utilised, the depth
of the lesion is limited to 2-6mm. There is therefore
a need for a new improved catheter making possible
deeper and larger lesions in the myocardium of the
heart.US 5,083,565 discloses a catheter having a pair
of spaced electrodes which can be projected from the
distal end of the catheter into tissue, so as to
supply RF energy thereto. DE 3616616 discloses a
surgical cutting appliance with a knife slidably
mounted at the distal end to which RF energy can be
supplied.
A device according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from
US-A-4 641 649.In general, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a catheter having a needle
electrode for radiofrequency of the myocardium of the
heart for obtaining deeper and larger lesions in the
myocardium. A further object of the invention is to provide a
catheter of the above character in which the same
needle is used for penetration and for supplying the
RF energy to the myocardium.Another object of the invention is to provide a
catheter of the above character having a needle which
is retractable.Another object of the invention is to provide a
catheter of the above character which can be advanced
independently of the catheter.Another object of the invention is to provide a
catheter of the above character whose distal extremity
can be steered.Accordingly, the present invention provides a
catheter for use in radiofrequency ablation of the
myocardium of the heart as set out in claim 1.Additional objects and features of the invention
will appear from the following description in which
the preferred embodiments are set forth in detail in
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.Figure 1 is a side elevational view partially in
cross-section showing a catheter having a fixed needle
electrode for radiofrequency ablation of

<CLAIMS>
A catheter (11,41,121) for use in
radiofrequency ablation of the myocardium of the heart

of a patient, comprising a flexible elongate member
(12,43,122) having at least one lumen (13,52,126)

extending therethrough and having proximal and distal
extremities, an electrode (21,71,146) formed solely of

a conducting material mounted on the distal extremity
of the flexible elongate member (12,43,122), a

conductor (26,86,151) extending through said lumen

(13,52,126) and connected to said electrode
(21,71,146) and means (32,42,142) for supplying

radiofrequency energy to said conductor (26,86,151)
and said electrode (21,71,146) to cause ablation of

the myocardium; characterised in that said electrode
(21,71,146) formed solely of a conducting material is

in the form of a single needle-like electrode having a
diameter of 0.051 to 0.203mm (.002 inches to .008

inches) and having a length ranging from .5 to 1cm.
A catheter (11,41,121) as claimed in claim
1, further characterised in that said flexible

elongate member (12,43,122) is sufficiently rigid so
that force can be applied to the proximal extremity

thereof to cause the needle-like electrode (21,71,146)
to penetrate the myocardium.
A catheter (41,121) as claimed in claim 1,
further including means (81,82,156) carried by the

distal extremity of the flexible elongate member
(43,122) for extending and retracting said needle-like

electrode (71,146).
A catheter (41) as claimed in claim 3, 
further characterised in that said means for extending

and retracting said needle-like electrode (71)
includes first and second spring members (81,82) of a

material having a negative coefficient of expansion
and means (62,63,64) for securing said spring members

(81,82) to said needle-like electrode (71) so that
when one of the first and second spring members

(81,82) is energised, the needle-like electrode (71)
is retracted and when the other of the first and

second spring members (81,82) is energised, the
needle-like electrode (71) is extended.
A catheter (121) as claimed in claim 4,
further characterised in that said means for extending

and retracting said needle-like electrode (146)
includes a push-pull wire (148) having proximal and

distal extremities extending through the lumen (126)
in the flexible elongate member (122), said needle-like

electrode (146) being mounted on the distal
extremity push-pull wire (148) and means (156) secured

to the proximal extremity of the push-pull wire (148)
for manually advancing and retracting the same.
A catheter (41,121) as claimed in claim 1,
further including a seal(76,161) disposed on the

distal extremity of the flexible elongate member
(43,122) and having a sealable opening (76,161)

therein through which the needle-like electrode
(71,146) can extend and retract.
A catheter (41,121) as claimed in claim 1,
further including means (101,143) for causing steering

movement of the distal extremity of the flexible
elongate member (43,122). 
A catheter (41,121) as claimed in claim 7,
further characterised in that said means (101,143) for

causing steering movement includes at least three
elongate elements (46,48,50,136-138) disposed

approximately 120Â° apart or less within the flexible
elongate member (43,122) and means for selectively

applying energy to said flexible elongate elements
(46,48,50,136-138) to cause steering movement of the

distal extremity of the flexible elongate member
(43,122).
