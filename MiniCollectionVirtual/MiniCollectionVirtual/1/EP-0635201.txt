<ABSTRACT>
A tray (10) for holding pots for aquarium plant has a 
base (11), a containment portion for containing material for 

weighing down the tray and pot locators (13) with means for 
locating aquarium pots (30) such that their side walls are 

out of contact with the pot locators (13). In a preferred 
embodiment, the pots (30) engage the locators (13) with a 

bayonet fitting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to plant holders for use with 
aquarium plants, being plants which live in an aquarium or 
possibly in a pond, and which have their roots below water 
level. There has been a practical difficulty in handling and 
displaying aquarium plants for sale, in that the plants, 
their roots and the growing medium in which the roots live 
have to be kept below water level. One common solution to the problem has been to weigh 
down pots containing aquarium plants and growing medium by 
using lead weights. This solution is impractical because of 
the need for individual lead weighting of pots, and 
environmentally unattractive because of the use of lead. An alternative solution for merchants of aquarium 
plants is to have a special aquarium constructed with 
retaining guides enabling polystyrene trays to be slid in 
and held below the water level. The polystyrene trays have 
holes formed in them and pots containing aquarium plants can 
be held in the trays by a friction fit. This solution is 
unattractive because the polystyrene trays have to be fitted 
in specially built guides, the use of a friction fit for the 
pots can result in damage to the plants (aquarium plant pots 
generally having perforated sides, and plants growing 
through the perforations), and the fact that the pot sides 
are at least partly surrounded by sold material will tend to 
affect plant development. According to a first aspect of the invention, there 
is provided a tray for holding pots for aquarium plants, 
which tray has a base, a weight material containment portion 
for containing material for weighing down the tray, and a 
multiplicity of pot locators, which pot locators have pot 
locating means for locating aquarium plant pots at or 
adjacent the base of the pots such that the pots, in use, 
stand with their side walls above and out of contact with 
the pot locators. According to a further aspect of the invention, there  
 
is provided a pot for an aquarium plant, which pot has a 
base, wall means extending upwardly from the base and 
engagement means on the base adapted to engage the pot 
locating means of a tray according to the invention. According to a further aspect of the invention there 
is provided a tray in combination with at least one pot for 
aquarium plants, the tray having a base, a weight material 
containment portion containing material for weighing down 
the tray, and a multiplicity of pot locators, the pot having 
a pot base and wall means extending upwardly from the base, 
which pot locators

A tray for holding pots for aquarium plants, which 
tray has a base, a weight material containment portion for 

containing material for weighing down the tray, and a 
multiplicity of pot locators, which pot locators have pot 

locating means for locating aquarium plant pots at or 
adjacent the base of the pots such that the pots, in use, 

stand with their side walls above and out of contact with 
the pot locators. 
A tray as claimed in Claim 1 having side walls 
extending around the periphery of the base to define the 

weight material containing portion. 
A tray as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the pot locators 
are at or above the height of the side walls relative to the 

base. 
A tray as claimed in any one of Claims 1-3 wherein the 
locating means comprise an annular inwardly extending flange 

having at least a pair of cut-out portions to allow radially 
outwardly extending members to engage the flange. 
A pot for an aquarium plant, which pot has a base, 
wall means extending upwardly from the base and engagement 

means on the base adapted to engage the pot locating means 
of a tray as claimed in any one of Claims 1-4. 
A pot as claimed in Claim 5 which is movable into and 
out of engagement with the locating means of the pot 

locators by rotation of the pot relative to the locator. 
A tray in combination with at least one pot for 
aquarium plants, the tray having a base, a weight material 

containment portion containing material for weighing down 
the tray, and a multiplicity of pot locators, the pot having 

a pot base and wall means extending upwardly from the base, 
which pot locators have pot locating means and said pot hole 

pots having engagement means at or adjacent said pot base 
engaging a respective one of said pot locating means, the 

engagement means of the or each pot being releasable from 
the associated pot locating means. 
A pot and tray combination as claimed in Claim 7 
wherein the engaging means of said pot are movable into and 

out of engagement with the locating means of the associated 
pot locator by rotation of the pot relative to the locator. 
A pot and tray combination as claimed in Claim 7 or 
Claim wherein the engagement means and the locating means 

constitute a bayonet fitting. 
A pot and tray combination as claimed in any one of 
Claims 7 to 9 wherein the engagement means extend from a 

cylindrical portion on the base of the pot, which 
cylindrical portion fits against the inner surface of the 

annular flange of the pot locator, whereby any plant growth 
is cut from the pl
ant in the pot when the pot is engaged in 
the pot locator.
