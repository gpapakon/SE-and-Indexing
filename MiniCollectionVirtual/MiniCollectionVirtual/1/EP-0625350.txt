<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a composition for permanent waving of hair which contains as keratin-reducing agent 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic acid and/or its salts, and to a method for permanent hair waving. The composition according to the invention permits gentle and uniform waving of hair without allergic or sensitising reactions.

<CLAIMS>
Use of an agent for the permanent shaping of hair, characterised in that it
contains as keratin-reducing active substance 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic acid

and/or its salts.
Use of an agent for the permanent shaping of hair according to Claim 1,
characterised in that it contains an amount of from 5 to 25 % by weight of 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic

acid and/or its salts.
Use of an agent according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the salt of 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic
acid is selected from the ammonium salt and the

monoethanolamine salt of 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic acid.
Use of an agent according to any one of Claim 1 to 3, characterised in that it
contains the 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic acid and/or its salts as the sole

keratin-reducing active substance and the pH value is from 6 to 9.
Agent for the permanent shaping of hair, characterised in that the pH value is from
6 to 8,5 and that it contains as keratin-reducing compound 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic

acid and/or its salts.
Agent according to Claim 5, characterised in that the salt of 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic
acid is selected from the ammonium salt or the

monoethanolamine salt.
Agent according to any one of Claims 5 to 6, characterised in that besides 2-hydroxy-3-mercaptopropionic

acid and/or its salts an additional keratin-reducing
compound selected from thioglycolic acid, thiolactic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic

acid, cysteine or its derivatives and cysteamine or its derivatives, is contained.
Process for the permanent shaping of hair, wherein, before and/or after it is
brought into the desired shape, the hair is treated with a shaping agent, rinsed

with water, then treated oxidatively, rinsed with water, optionally arranged in a
water wave, and then dried, characterised in that the shaping agent used is an

agent according to any one of Claims 1 to 7. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterised in that the shaping agent is allowed
to take effect for from 5 to 30 minutes.
Process according to Claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the amount of shaping
agent applied is from 60 to 120 grams.
