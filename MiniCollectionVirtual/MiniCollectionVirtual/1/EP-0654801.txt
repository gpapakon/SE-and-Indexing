<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic powder and a permanent magnet having magnetic properties
enhanced by taking advantage of a magnetic interaction and a process for producing them.In general, permanent magnetic materials have a tendency that an enhancement in saturation
magnetization (or residual magnetic flux density) is not compatible with a high coercive force.
More specifically, the following tendency is observed.Soft magnetic materials are those materials which have a high saturation magnetization. For
example, permendur has such a high saturation magnetization of 24 kG (x10-1T). It, however,
has little or no coercive force.On the other hand, hard magnetic materials with a high coercive force, however, have much
lower saturation magnetization than that of the soft magnetic materials. Among the hard
magnetic materials, R2Fe14B-based, R2Fe17Nx-based and R2TM17-based materials have a relatively
high saturation magnetization.In the R2Fe14B-based materials, in order to enhance the saturation magnetization, it is necessary
to reduce the volume fraction grain boundary phase and maximize the volume fraction of the
R2Fe14B phase as a main phase. A volume reduction in the grain boundary phase, however,
makes it difficult to separate each grain of main phase, resulting in a low coercive force. When R
is Nd, a high saturation magnetization is obtained. On the other hand, in order to obtain a high
coercive force, it is a common practice to substitute Dy or the other heavy rare earth element for
part of Nd. The substitution with Dy lowers the saturation magnetization.The saturation magnetization of the R2Fe17Nx-based material (particularly when R = Sm) is nearly
equal to that of Nd2Fe14B. However, in order to obtain a coercive force, the powder particle
diameter must be pulverized to several µm, so that the coercive force obtained is substantially
small for practical use. Further, since the material has to be a finely milled, when it is compacted
into a bonded magnet or the like, the packing density of magnetic powder can't be raised. The
addition of V, Mn or the like makes it possible to obtain a high coercive force in a relatively large
powder particle diameter. It, however, results in a lowered saturation magnetization.R2TM17-based (particularly R = Sm) bonded magnets are reported in many documents such as
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 22696/1989, 25819/1989 and 40483/1989 and patents and
papers cited therein. Especially, an attempt to increase the Fe content of TM has been made as a
means for improving
