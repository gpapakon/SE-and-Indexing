<ABSTRACT>
For enabling a liquid display drive with a low 

voltage and a high speed, each pixel is provided with a 
liquid crystal cell 5, a switching transistor 7 and an 

additional capacitance 9, and the additional capacitances 
are electrically commonly connected for a block of 

plural pixels. After the image signal is supplied to 
the pixels corresponding to the block, the potential 

of desired one of the common electrode lines 52, 52', 
to which the additional capacitances 9 corresponding to 

the block are connected, is varied and retained at thus 
varied value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
driving a liquid crystal display device, and more 
particularly to a method for driving a matrix liquid 
crystal display device having plural pixels arranged in 
a matrix. In recent years, the liquid crystal display 
devices are commercialized in various fields such as 
display for a word processor, a personal computer or 
the like, electronic view finder for a video camera, 
projection television or displays for an automobile. 
Also there is being required image display of a larger 
size, a higher resolution and a higher image quality. Fig. 1 schematically shows the configuration of 
such liquid crystal display device, applied for a 
television receiver. In Fig. 1 there are shown a vertical shift 
register 10; a horizontal shift register 20; switching 
transistors 22; a common signal line 24; a signal 
inverting circuit 30; a clock generator circuit 40; a 
liquid crystal display panel 100; address signal lines 
V₁, V₂,..., Vm-1, Vm; vertical data signal lines D₁, 
D₂,..., Dn; a signal S bearing image information; and  
 
an output signal S' bearing image information, released 
from the signal inverting circuit 30. The vertical data signal lines D₁ - Dn are 
connected, respectively through the horizontal transfer 
switches 22, to the signal line 24, and the gates of the 
horizontal transfer switches 22 receive signals from the 
horizontal shift register 20, in response to the signal 
from the clock generator circuit 40. The signal from 
the clock generator circuit 40 is also supplied to the 
vertical shift register 10, thus driving the address 
signal lines V₁ - Vm in succession in synchronization 
with the signal S. The signal from the clock generator 
circuit 40 is further supplied to the signal inverting 
circuit 30, thereby inverting the signal S in 
synchronisation therewith. The clock generator circuit 
40 is given an unrepresented synchronization signal, 
prepared from the image information bearing signal S, in 
order to achieve synchronization with the signal S. In this manner the vertical shift register 10, 
the horizontal shift register 20 and the signal 
inverting circuit 30 effect the desired television 
scanning operation, by means of the pulses prepared by 
the clock generator 40. In the liquid crystal panel 100, a row of pixels 
is selected by the address signal lines V₁ - Vm from the 
vertical shift register 10, and the vertical data signal 
lines D₁ - Dn are selected by the successive activations  
 
of the horizontal transfer switches 22
