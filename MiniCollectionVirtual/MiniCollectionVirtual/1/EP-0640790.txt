<ABSTRACT>
For the suspended attachment of the personal computer supported with its base on a wall, at least the feet provided in the upper corner regions of the base are replaced by bolt-like holding elements (1). The holding element (1) has at one end a protected centring mandrel (2) which is inserted in catch bores of the base. A disc-shaped projection (4) is provided at the other end. Attached to the mounting wall is a horizontally arranged support element (13) with U-shaped catch notches (14) which are open at the top and into which the bolt-like holding element (1) is inserted, the disc-shaped projection engaging behind the support element (13) extending with slight spacing from the mounting wall.

<CLAIMS>
Supporting device for a desktop personal computer 

with a cuboid housing whose base surface has at the 
respective corner regions locating bores for mounting 

feet which are to be attached thereto, characterized in 
that the supporting device has at least two bolt-type 

retaining elements (1) and a rail-type support element 
(13) arranged horizontally on a wall, in that one bolt-type 

retaining element (1) each is provided at one end 
with a slotted centring mandrel (2) in order, for the 

purpose of pendulously attaching the personal computer 
supported with its base surface on a wall, to replace at 

least the mounting feet provided in the upper corners, 
and in order to enter the locating bores of the base 

surface, in that each retaining element has a disk-type 
attachment (4) at the other end, and in that the support 

element (13) is provided with U-shaped locating notches 
(14) which are open upwards and which the bolt-type 

retaining element (1) enters, the disk-type attachment 
(4) gripping behind the support element (13), which 

extends at a slight distance from the wall. 
Supporting device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the bolt-type retaining element (1) has 

an annular stop collar (5) on the region facing the base 
surface of the PC housing, the width of the annular 

groove (6) remaining between the stop collar (5) and the 
disk-shaped attachment (4) being adapted to the wall 

thickness of the rail-type support element (13). 
Supporting device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the bolt-type retaining element (1)  

 
has a central screw thread (7), and in that the screw (8) 

which can be screwed into the screw thread (7) has a pin-shaped 
end piece (9) which penetrates as far as into the 

slotted centring mandrel (2) of the retaining element (1) 
when the screw (8) is screwed in. 
Supporting device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the disk-shaped attachment (4) of 

the retaining element (1) has a depression (11) corresponding 
to at least the dimensions of the screw head 

(10). 
Supporting device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the U-shaped 

locating notches (14) of the support element (13) are 
arranged extending obliquely. 
Supporting device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the support 

element (13) is part of a retaining wall (12) adapted to 
the dimensions of the base surface of the PC housing, and 

in that on the lower end the retaining wall (12) has a 
protective angle (15) attached in a right-angled fashion. 
Supporting device according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the protective angle (15) of the 

retaining wall (12) has a sieve-type perforated 
structure.
