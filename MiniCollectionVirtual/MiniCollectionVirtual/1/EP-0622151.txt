<ABSTRACT>
A Pb-free solder alloy, based on the Sn-In-Zn system (exemplarily 
86:5:9 weight %), is disclosed. Composition can have a melting temperature in the 

range 183°C ± 10°C and thus can be readily substituted for conventional 40 Pb - 
60 Sn solder. The novel composition also can possess superior mechanical 

properties, compared to the 40/60 Pb-Sn composition, and readily wets copper.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to Pb-free solder, and to an article comprising the
solder.Solder bonding is a critical step in many industrial processes, e.g., in
interconnection and packaging of electronic devices. The most widely used
solder is the near eutectic Pb-60% (by weight) Sn alloy. However, due to the
toxicity of lead (Pb), there is currently substantial interest in Pb-free substitute
solder compositions. Some such compositions are known, (see, for instance,
W.B. Hampshire, Electronic Materials Handbook Vol. 1, Packaging, ASM
International, Metals Park, OH 1989, p.633).However, known Pb-free solder compositions have melting temperatures
that differ significantly from that of the standard Pb-Sn solder, and have not found
significant use in, e.g. electronic packaging. For example, Japanese patent
application JP-A-2197396 discloses a Pb-free solder composition having a
melting temperature of 200-235°C. It is common practice in electronic packaging
to solder the various levels of the package with different solders of different
melting points, selected so that the soldering of each successive level does not
inadvertently melt the previously soldered level. Thus, use of a substitute solder
having a melting point that differs substantially from that of the solder that is
being replaced might require re-design of the packaging operation (a very
expensive proposition), or else could cause problems in manufacturing
sequences, efficiency, and/or yields. In view of the strong reasons for avoiding
Pb-based solder, it would be very desirable to have available a Pb-free solder
composition having a melting temperature close (e.g., within ±10°C) to that of the
standard 40/60 Pb-Sn solder, and having other characteristics (e.g., strength,
wettability, creep resistance) that make it suitable as a substitute solder for the
standard Pb-based solder. This application discloses such a composition.FIG. 1 compares creep deformation of samples of Pb-60%Sn, Sn-5%In-9%Zn,
and Sn-10%In-9%Zn, respectively; and FIG. 2 shows solderability data measured by the wetting balance test.In a broad aspect the invention is embodied in an article that comprises
an essentially Pb-free solder composition having a melting temperature that is close
to (desirably within ±10°C) that of conventional eutectic or near-eutectic Pb-Sn
solder. By "melting temperature" we mean herein the liquidus temperature.More specifically, the Pb-free composition according to the invention
comprises Sn (at least 70, typically at least 80 weight %), Zn
(between 6 and
