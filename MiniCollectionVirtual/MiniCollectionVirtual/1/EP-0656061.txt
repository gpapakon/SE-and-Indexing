<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel glycoforms of
the soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1), and their
uses in the diagnosis and therapy of disorders involving
complement activity and various inflammatory and immune
disorders. The invention also provides methods of
producing, detecting, and purifying such glycoforms.Constituting about 10% of the globulins in normal
serum, the complement system is composed of many different
proteins that are important in the immune system's response
to foreign antigens. The complement system becomes
activated when its primary components are fragmented and
the fragments, alone or with other proteins, activate
additional complement proteins resulting in a proteolytic
cascade. Activation of the complement system leads to
increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis of phagocytic
cells, activation of inflammatory cells, opsonization of
foreign particles, direct killing of cells and tissue
damage. Activation of the complement system may be
triggered by antigen-antibody complexes (the classical
pathway) or for example, by lipopolysaccharides present in
cell walls of pathogenic bacteria (the alternative
pathway).Complement receptor type 1 (CR1) is present on the
membranes of erythrocytes, monocytes/macrophages,
granulocytes, B cells, some T cells, splenic follicular
dendritic cells, and glomerular podocytes. CR1 binds to the 
complement components C3b and C4b and has also been
referred to as the C3b/C4b receptor. The structural
organization and primary sequence of CR1 is known
(Klickstein et al., 1987, J. Exp. Med. 165:1095-1112,
Klickstein et al., 1988, J. Exp. Med. 168:1699-1717;
Hourcade et al., 1988, J. Exp. Med. 168:1255-1270). It is
composed of 30 short consensus repeats (SCRs) that contain
60-70 amino acids. In each SCR, 29 of the average 65 amino
acids are conserved. Each SCR has been proposed to form a
three dimensional triple loop structure through disulfide
linkages with the third and first and the fourth and second
half-cystines in disulfide bonds. CR1 is further arranged
as 4 long homologous repeats (LHRs) of 7 SCRs each.
Following a leader sequence, which is post-translationally
removed, the CR1 molecule consists of the most N-terminal
LHR-A comprising a C4b binding domain, the next two
repeats, LHR-B and LHR-C comprising C3b binding domains,
and the most C terminal LHR-D followed by 2 additional
SCRs, a 25 residue putative transmembrane region and a 43
residue cytoplasmic tail.CR1 is a member of a protein superfamily characterized
by this SCR homology. Some
