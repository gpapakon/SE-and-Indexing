<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel pyridinecarboximidamide 
compounds having a vasodilating effect. Prior to the accomplishment of the present 
invention, we found that various N-cyano-carboximidamide 
compounds had a hypotensive activity, a vasodilating 
effect and the like (as described in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publications Nos. 163061/1991 and 218343/1991). 
However, more excellent novel antihypertensive or 
antianginal agents are strongly demanded when the various 
conditions of diseases, the quality of life, that is, the 
support and improvement of patients' daily life, side 
effects of drugs and the like are taken into 
consideration. An object of the present invention is to provide 
novel compounds having a vasodilating effect, and more 
specifically compounds having an antihypertensive effect 
or an antianginal effect. The present invention has been 
accomplished on the basis of the finding that novel 
pyridinecarboximidamide compounds have a vasodilating 
effect. The pyridinecarboximidamide compounds according to 
the present invention are represented by the following 
formula (I): 
 
wherein 
when R1 represents an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, carboxyl, 
amino, acylamino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, aralkylamino,  
 
alkylsulfonamide, bisalkylsulfonylamino or hydroxyl 
group, R2 represents a hydrogen atom and R3 represents a 
nitroxyl, 2-chlorophenyl or phenyl group; and when R1 represents a hydrogen atom, R2 represents a 
hydroxyalkyl, carboxyl, amino, acylamino, 
alkylamino, dialkylamino, aralkylamino, alkylsulfonamide, 
bisalkylsulfonylamino or hydroxyl group and R3 represents 
a nitroxyl, 2-chlorophenyl or phenyl group. The present invention also relates to use of the 
compounds mentioned above. That is, the antihypertensive 
agent according to the present invention comprises as an 
active ingredient a pyridinecarboximidamide represented 
by formula (I) above or an acid adduct salt thereof, and 
the antianginal agent comprises as an active ingredient a 
pyridinecarboximidamide represented by formula (I) above 
wherein R3 is a nitroxyl group or an acid adduct salt 
thereof. Fig. 1 is a reaction scheme for producing the 
compound of the present invention represented by the 
formula (I) and illustrates the production of the N-cyano-pyridinecarboximidamide 
compound represented by the 
formula (I) in which R1 represents an alkyl group, a 
hydroxyalkyl group, a carboxyl group, an amino group, an 
alkylamino group, a dialkylamino group, an aralkylamino 
group or a hydroxyl group, and R2 represents
