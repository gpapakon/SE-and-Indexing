<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the recovery
of waste heat from chemical reactions. More particularly,
the invention relates to a method of operating waste heat
boiler with improved control of cooling efficiency.Waste heat boilers are most generally used for the
generation of steam by waste heat recovered from hot process
streams. Typically, those boilers are designed as
shell-and-tube exchangers with a plurality of heat exchanging
tubes arranged within a cylindrical shell.Two basic types of shell-and-tube exchangers are
employed in the industry, the watertube type, in which
water/steam mixtures flow through the tubes, and the fire
tube type having the heating process stream inside the
tubes.The characteristic components of the boiler are the
tubes mounted in tubesheets at a front-end head and a rear-end
head within the shell. In the firetube boilers steam
production is accomplished on the shell side of the tubes
by indirect heat exchange of a hot process stream flowing
through the boiler tubes. The shell side is through a
number of risers and downcomers connected to a steam drum,
which may be arranged at the top of the boiler shell.The mechanical design and, in particular, dimensioning
of the heat exchanging surface in shell-and-tube
exchanger type boilers represent certain problems. Boiler
applications involve high pressures on the shell side and
considerable temperature differences between the shell-and-tube
side. Particular considerations have to be given to
fouling and corrosion characteristics of the process
stream.Boilers handling fouling or corrosion prove process
streams must be designed to a higher duty than required in
order to allow for satisfying lifetime under serious
fouling and corroding conditions. The heat transferring 
surface of the boiler tubes has further to be adapted to
expected corrosion and fouling factors in the stream. To
provide for a desired and substantially constant cooling
effect during long term operation of the boilers, appropriate
heat transfer and temperature control is required.Conventionally designed boilers are equipped with a
by-pass of a large diameter tube, which may be internal or
external to the boiler shell. The by-pass is usually construed
as an insulated tube provided with a flow control
valve. During initial operation of the boilers, part of the
hot process stream is by-passed the heat transferring tubes
to limit the heat transfer within the required level.After a certain time on stream fouling and corrosion
of the tubes increase, leading to
