<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an automatically and manually operated device for controlling the ride height in a motor vehicle with hydropneumatic suspension. The device comprises a hydraulic height-corrector (1) with a spool (slide) (t), means for detecting the height of the axle acting on the spool (t) by means of first prestressed elastic means (3), these detection means constituting the abovementioned automatic control, and an operating lever (2) acting on the spool (t) by means of second prestressed elastic means (O), this lever (2) constituting the abovementinoed manual control. The elastic means (for example coil springs 3, 4) are such that they balance out the loads which they exert on the spool (t) when the operating lever (2) changes from the so-called reference position to the intermediate position. This invention applies particularly to the automatic and manual control of the ride height in a motor vehicle, in particular.

Device for the automatic and manual control of 
the height for an axle of an automotive vehicle with a 

hydropneumatic suspension or the like, of the kind 
comprising a hydraulic height corrector (1) with a spool 

(t), means for sensing the height of the axle acting 
upon the spool through the medium of first elastic means 

(N), these detection means constituting the aforesaid 
automatic control and an operating lever (2) acting upon 

the spool through the medium of second elastic means 
(O), this lever constituting the aforesaid manual 

control, characterized in that the first and second 

elastic means (N, O) are prestressed elastic means. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the aforesaid elastic means (N, O) are determined 

in order that the forces they exert upon the spool (t) 
are balancing when the second ones (O) have been 

deformed upon the passage of the operating lever (2) 
from the reference position to the intermediate position 

and the first ones (N) have been deformed upon the 
corresponding action of the detection means. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the first and second elastic means 

(N, O) are two helical springs (3, 4), respectively, 
with crossed ends (3a, 3b; 4a, 4b). 
Device according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the springs (3, 4) are prestressed so that both 

ends (3a, 3b) and (4a, 4b) of each spring (3, 4) tend to 
move towards each other. 
Device according to any one of the claims 3 and 
4, characterized in that both aforesaid springs (3, 4) 

are mounted onto two levers (5, 6), respectively, 
pivoting about the axis (X, Y) of their helical portion, 

their ends, (3a, 3b) and (4a, 4b) bearing upon ledges 
(5a, 5b; 6a, 6b) provided on the corresponding levers 

(5, 6) and the two automatic and manual controls,  
 

respectively, acting directly or indirectly upon these 
levers (5, 6). 
Device according to claim 5, characterized in 
that both ends of at least one of the aforesaid springs 

(3, 4) are also bearing upon two ledges (7a, 7b) 
provided on an end part (7) made fast to the spool (t) 

of the corrector (1). 
Device according to any one of claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that at least one of the manual and 

automatic controls acts upon one part (8 or 5) 
comprising two ledges (8a, 8b or 5a, 5b) upon which are 

bearing the ends of the corresponding spring (3, 4). 
Device according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the part (8) upon which acts the manual control is 

located at the end of a control rod (9) actuated by the 
operating lever (2). 
Device according to any one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterized in that at least one of the manual and 

automatic operating levers (5, 6) comprises a finger 
(10) projecting into a notch (11) formed on the end part 

(7) of the spool (t). 
Device according to claim 9, characterized in 
that the manual operating lever (6) comprises the 

aforesaid finger (10), the said notch (11) has a 
sufficient length in order that the automatic control be 

not impeded by the manual control when the latter is in 
the position corresponding to the reference height of 

the vehicle. 
Device according to any one of claims 9 and 10, 
characterized in that the ledges (7a, 7b) upon which are 

bearing the ends (3a, 3b) of the spring (3) of the 
automatic control are lying on either side of the said 

notch (11). 
Device according to any one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the assemblies consisting 

of each spring (3, 4) and its associated lever (5, 6) 
are disposed in perpendicular relation to each other.  

 
Device according to any one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the operating lever (2) 

comprises a rod (12) pivotally mounted onto a support 
(13) exhibiting notches (14), the said control rod (9) 

being fastened to one of the ends of this rod (12) and 
extending in perpendicular relation to its axis of 

rotation (Z), a handle (15) slidably mounted at the 
other end of this rod (12) and means for returning the 

handle (15) towards the bottom of the notches (14).
