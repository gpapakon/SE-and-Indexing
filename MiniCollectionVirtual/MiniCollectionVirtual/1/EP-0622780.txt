<ABSTRACT>
An individual's speech sample, obtained for the purpose of speaker verification, is 
used to create a "protected" model of the speech. The protected model, which is 

stored in a database in association with a personal identifier for that individual, is 
arranged so that the characteristics of the individual's speech cannot be ascertained 

from the protected model, without access to an encryption key or other secured 
information stored in the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a speaker verification system and process for
confirming the claimed identity of an individual using stored speech samples, and, in
particular, to a system and process used to generate and store speech samples and to
retrieve the speech samples so that they are secured against abuse for later use in the
speaker verification process.Speaker verification processes and systems are used to confirm the
identity of an individual for such purposes as controlling or limiting access to a
resource. In this context, a resource could be the telephone network, a bank account,
or a computer. Generally speaking, certain characteristics of an individual's speech
sample, also called a speaker utterance, are used to form a template or model, which
is stored. When a person claiming to be that individual (hereinafter, the "claimant")
seeks access to the resource, the claimant is asked to provide a speech sample. The
characteristics of the speech sample offered by the claimant are compared with the
stored template or model, and the identify is confirmed only upon a successful
match.Users of speaker verification systems have expressed concern that stored
speech samples can be misappropriated and/or misused, with dire consequences.
This is because a person whose speech sample is compromised cannot "discard" or
change their individual speech characteristics and provide a new sample, in the same
manner as a personal identification number (PIN). When a PIN is compromised, a
new one can be assigned to the person, and the old one canceled or invalidated.
However, if thief obtains a speech sample, or a speech template or model for a
particular person, the thief in essence can "become" that person, at least for the
purpose of identifying himself to a speech verification system.EP-A-0 454 363 and M. Birnbaum et al in AT&T Technical Journal, vol
63, no. [5], September-October 1986, "A voice password system for access security"
disclose methods as set out in the preamble of claim 1.EP-A- 0 121 222 discloses a method for storing a fingerprint on a
portable medium and reading the information for the purpose of comparison.
Information derived from the fingerprint itself is used to scramble a laser beam used to
form a hologram of the fingerprint, which is then stored on the medium. Information
derived from a claimant's fingerprint is then used to scramble in the same way a laser
beam used to read the hologram.A method and system according to the invention are as set out in the
claims.In accordance with the present
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for confirming the claimed identity of an individual, said
individual having a personal identifier, said method comprising the steps of:


receiving (501) a sample of the individual's speech;
creating (503, 504) a model of said speech using said sample;
storing (505) said model in association with said personal identifier;
in response to a request for identity confirmation, receiving (601) a
sample of a claimant's speech and a personal identifier provided by said claimant;
retrieving (603) the model associated with said personal identifier
received from said claimant;
performing (604) a comparison to determine if said retrieved model
corresponds to said claimant's speech sample;
and confirming the identity of said claimant only if said comparison
indicates a positive match;

   CHARACTERISED IN THAT:

said creating step comprises creating a protected model of said speech by
transforming (503) said sample using a transformation method such that characteristics

of said individual's speech cannot be ascertained by accessing said protected speech
model without the use of additional stored information, wherein the transformation

method is based on at least the personal identifier; and
prior to said comparison, said claimant's speech sample is transformed
(602) with the same transformation method used in said creating step.
A system for confirming the claimed identity of an individual using
speech verification, said individual having a personal identifier, said system comprising:


receiving means (200) for receiving an individual's speech sample of
said individual's speech, said individual's personal identifier, a claimant's speech

sample of a claimant's speech, and a personal identifier from said claimant;
means (205) for creating a model of said individual' s speech;
means (207) for storing said model in association with said individual's
personal identifier and for retrieving the model associated with said personal identifier

received from said claimant in response to a request for identity confirmation; 
and comparing means (206) for performing a comparison to determine if
said retrieved model corresponds to said claimant's speech sample, and confirming the

identity of said claimant only if said comparison indicates a positive match;

   CHARACTERISED IN THAT:

said means for creating a model is adapted to create a protected model of
said individual' s speech using a transformation method that transforms said

individual's speech sample such that the characteristics of said individual's speech
cannot be ascertained by accessing said protected model without the use of additional

information stored in the system, wherein the transformation method is based on at least
the personal identifier;
transforming means (203) are provided for transforming said claimant's
speech sample with said transformation method; and
said comparing means are arranged to perform said comparison using
said transformed speech sample.
