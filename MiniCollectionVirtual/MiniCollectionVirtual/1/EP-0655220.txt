<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems for generating 

diagnostic images of a patient's internal organs and more 
particularly, this invention relates to improved MRI systems 

with decreased interference between the magnetic field used for 
producing diagnostic images and the magnetic fields generated 

by the electric motors (35,86) used for driving the pistons of the 
contrast media injectors. Additionally, the system employs an 

improved communication link (22,26) between an externally located 
system controller (12) and the injection head control (38) unit located 

within the electromagnetic isolation barrier (18) which defines the 
magnetic imaging room.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) system for generating diagnostic images
of a patient's internal organs.It has become recognized that MRI systems
require isolation from external sources of electromagnetic
fields, if optimum image quality is to be obtained
from MRI diagnostic procedures. Conventional MRI systems
have typically employed some form of electromagnetic
isolation chamber which is generally a room enclosed
by copper sheeting or conductive mesh material
that isolates the room from undesirable sources of electromagnetic
radiation and the electromagnetic noise inherent
in the atmosphere.In order to realize the full benefit of the shielded
room, these systems employ a controller for the contrast
media injector portion of the system which is isolated
from the media injector as for example disclosed in "In Vitro Evaluation of a Mechanical Injector for Infusion of Magnetic Resonanse Contrast Media", Vol 26 Nuember 8, pages 748-751, Investigative Radiology. Such isolation is effected to prevent
undesirable electromagnetic radiation generated
by the system controller from interfering with the signals
used to create the magnetic resonance images.The external, isolated location of the system
controller creates various problems associated with the
installation and operation of these systems. One such
problem is the need to provide a communications link
between the externally located controller and the contrast
media injectors, without introducing extraneous
electromagnetic radiation. That is, there is a need to provide
electrical power supply lines for operation of the
contrast media injectors and the injector control circuitry
while maintaining the integrity of the electromagnetic
shield.Previous attempts to solve these problems included
drilling holes in the wall of the electromagnetic
shield for inserting the necessary lines or, alternatively,
laying the lines under a shielded floor of the imaging
room. These alternatives have proven to be less than
optimum, since spurious radiation arose from the presence
of the various supply cables within the shielded
imaging suite. Additionally. MRI systems which employed
these solutions required substantial site dedication
and were therefore not very portable.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention
to provide an improved magnetic resonance imaging
contrast media delivery system having decreased
interference between the magnetic field used to obtain
the magnetic resonance image and the magnetic fields
created by ancillary
