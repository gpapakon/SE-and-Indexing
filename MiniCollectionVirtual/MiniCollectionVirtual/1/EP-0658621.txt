<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for removal of contaminating nucleic acid 
from a biological sample by exposing the sample to a unique combination of enzymes. The 

combination of enzymes includes an enzyme which cleaves nucleic acid in an endonuclitic 
manner and an enzyme which cleaves nucleic acid in an exonuclitic manner. After exposure of 

the sample to the combination of enzymes, any nucleic acid to be detected may be amplified 
prior to detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
Preparation of nucleic acid fragments for amplification may involve numerous steps 
including collection of an appropriate biological sample, liquification of the sample, lysis of the 
cells in the sample, dissociation of the DNA by phenol/chloroform extraction, and binding-elution 
of DNA to glass surfaces. However, amplification of the desired nucleic acid fragments 
is often hampered by the presence of other non-target nucleic acid fragments which interfere 
with the amplification process by hybridizing to primers and causing amplification of undesired 
products, overwhelming target specific amplification. The enzymes (polymerases) are often 
exhausted from extension of non-target nucleic acid. Conventional techniques for addressing the problems created by non-target nucleic acid 
fragments are time consuming, tedious, and/or labor intensive. Some of these methods involve 
the culturing of the biological sample to increase the number of organisms which would 
contain the desired nucleic acid fragment prior to amplification (see Brisson-Noel et al., The 
Lancet, Nov. 4, 1989, pp. 1069-1071; and Pierre et al., J. Clin. Microbiol., vol. 29, April 1991, 
pp. 712-717). However, these methods add extra days to the process. Others skilled in the art 
only analyze purified cultures rather than clinical samples (see Patel et al., J. Clin. Microbiol, 
vol. 28, March 1990, pp. 513-518; Hance et al., Molecular Microbiol., vol. 3, 1989, pp. 843-849; 
and Fries et al., J. Clin. Microbiol., vol. 29, August 1991 pp. 1744-1747). Still others 
have used tedious DNA extraction methods to purify DNA prior to amplification (see DeWit et 
al., J. Clin. Microbiol., vol. 28, Nov. 1990, pp 2437-2441; and Sjobring etal., J. Clin 
Microbiol., vol. 28, October 1990, pp. 2200-2204).  The present invention overcomes the time consuming, tedious and labor intensive 
characteristics of the conventional techniques as it relates to a method for removal of non-target 
nucleic acid from a biological sample which may contain a microorganism with nucleic 
acid to be detected, the method comprising exposing the biological sample to a combination of 
enzymes which cleave double stranded or single stranded nucleic acid in an endonuclitic and 
exonuclitic manner. A particularly useful combination of enzymes is (a) DNase I; (b) S 1 nuclease, and (c) 
Mung Bean Nuclease. The removal of the non-target nucleic acid from the biological sample is 
generally more effective when the sample is liquified prior to exposure to the combination of 
enzymes.
