<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a current-controlled
luminous element array and a method for producing the same,
and in particular to a current-controlled luminous element
array of an active matrix type such as for a display purpose,
having multiple current-controlled luminous elements arranged
in a matrix form, and a method for producing the same.As conventional current-controlled luminous elements
there are well known EL(electroluminescent) elements,
LED(light emitting diode)'s, etc. In particular, the orgranic
EL element of a charge injection type employing a thin-filmed
organic luminescent material as an illuminant, hereinafter
called "organic thin-film EL element", is attracting
attentions for the possibility of realizing an inexpensive
full-colored wide display that would be difficult by using an
inorganic thin-film EL element or an LED. There will be
described the constitution of a conventional typical current-control
led luminous element array in an EL panel using an
organic thin-film EL element.The organic thin-film EL element is a current-controlled
luminescent element of the type that is
constituted with an organic luminescent layer consisting of an
organic coloring matter strong of luminescence and a charge
injection layer, the layers being formed between a pair of
electrodes either or both transparent (or translucent), and
that gives an effective luminescence due to the recombination 
between injected electrons and positive holes from the
electrodes. An essential feature of the organic thin-film EL
element resides in that, with a lower voltage than a level
near 10 V, a higher luminance than a level near 1000 cd/m2 is
easily obtainable in addition to that a high luminous
efficiency is achieved in a range over several lumens per watt
(subject to a direct-current driving). Such the luminous
performance stands beyond those of inorganic thin-film EL
elements.An example of utilization of the high luminous
performance is reported in the JAPAN DISPLAY '89 published by
the Society for Information Display, at pages 704 to 707, in
which an organic thin-film EL element is applied to a dot
matrix display.Fig. 1 is a perspective sectional view of a display-oriented
organic thin-film EL panel in the example reported
in the above JAPAN DISPLAY '89, a collection book of prepared
papers. According to the collection book, the shown EL panel
has, on a glass base 150, a plurality of signal lines 151
extending parallel to one another, an organic thin-film layer
152 as an illuminant layer, and a plurality of
