<ABSTRACT>
A duplex cam-operated pressure-balanced sleeve valve 
is provided for controlling fluid flow into either one or both of 

two fluid lines, such as to either one or both of two filter 
elements, comprising, in combination;

 
(1) a valve housing; (1)

 
(2) first (8) and second (9) valve chambers in the 

housing in alignment with a cam chamber (10) therebe­
tween;

 
(3) first (2), second (3), and third (4) fluid flow ports in the 

housing communicating with the first valve chamber (8), and 
fourth (5), fifth (6) and sixth (7) fluid flow ports in the housing 

communicating with the second valve chamber; (9);
 

(4) a first reciprocable sleeve valve member (30) in the 
first valve chamber (8), axially movable within the first valve 

chamber (8) between positions controlling flow from the first 
(2) fluid port to one or both of the second (3) and third (4) 

fluid flow ports;
 

(5) a second reciprocable sleeve valve member (31), 
preferably coaxial with the first sleeve valve member (30), in 

the second valve chamber (9) axially movable within the 
second valve chamber (9) with the first sleeve valve member 

(30) between positions controlling flow from one or both of 
the fourth (5) and fifth (6) fluid flow ports to the sixth fluid 

flow port (7);
 

(6) cam-following valve-actuating means (47) in the 
cam chamber (10) operatively connected to both the first (30) 

and second (31) sleeve valve members, for reciprocably 
moving both valve members together between their flow-­

controlling positions;
 

(7) a cam (50) in the cam chamber (10) movable 
between at least three selected positions and operatively 

connected with the cam-following valve-actuating means in 
a manner such that;

 
(a) with the cam in a first position, the first sleeve valve 

member (30) is in a position communicating one of the 
second (3) and third (4) fluid flow ports with the first fluid 

flow port (2) and the second sleeve valve member (31) is in a 
position communicating one of the fourth (5) and fifth (6) 

fluid flow ports with the sixth fluid flow port (7);
 

(b) with the cam (50) in a second position, the first 
sleeve valve member (30) is in a position communicating the 

other of the second (3) and third (4) fluid flow ports with the 
first fluid flow port and the second sleeve valve member (31) 

is in a position communicating the other of the fourth (5) and 
fifth (6) fluid flow ports with the sixth fluid flow port (7);

 
(c) with the cam (50) in a third position, both the first 

(30) and second (31) sleeve valve members are in positions 
communicating the first (2) with the second (3) and third fluid 

flow ports and the fourth (5) with the fifth (6) and sixth (7) 
fluid flow ports;

 
(8) means for moving the cam (50) between each of the 

selected positions, thereby shifting the valves in unison;
 

(9) the first (30) and second (31) sleeve valve members 
each having an interior pressure-receiving surface exposed 

at all times to fluid pressure in the first (8) and second (9) 
valve chambers, respectively, and in the first (2) and sixth (7) 

fluid flow ports, respectively, and an exterior pressure-­
receiving surface exposed to fluid pressure in the second (3) 

and third (4), and fourth (5) and fifth (6) fluid flow ports, 
respectively, fluid flow through which is controlled by the 

respective sleeve valves (30-31), so that there is a zero 
component of force arising from any pressure differential 

across the valves tending either to move the sleeve valve 
members (30-31) or to resist cam-operated movement of the 

sleeve valve members (30-31) between their selected posi­
tions;

 
(10) the cam-following valve actuating means having 

opposed pressure-receiving surfaces, of which one is ex­
posed to fluid pressure in the first valve chamber (8), and the 

other is exposed to fluid pressure in the second valve 
chamber (9);

 
(11) the opposed pressure-receiving surfaces of the 

cam-following valve-actuating means being of such small 
relative surface areas that any fluid pressure differential 

between first (8) and second (9) valve chambers on the 
opposed pressure-receiving surfaces thereof offers negligi­

ble resistance to cam-operated reciprocation of the sleeve 
valve members (30-31), so that such fluid pressure differen­

tial does not interfere with movement of the first (30) and 
second (31) sleeve valve members between their selected 

positions.
