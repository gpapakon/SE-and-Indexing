<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valved coupling. Such a valved coupling may be
suited for use with cryogenic fluids.Valved coupling devices are used to couple and uncouple conduits for
conveying a wide variety of fluids. One such coupling device is used in the prior art
for conveying liquid nitrogen at temperatures of approximately -195째C (-320째F).This particular prior art coupling includes a nozzle and a receptacle. The
nozzle is connected to a supply container of the fluid, and the receptacle is connected
to a container that is to be filled.In this prior art coupling, the nozzle and the receptacle each include a valve.
A lever operated actuator on the nozzle is rotated to open the nozzle valve and to
push against and also open the receptacle valve to permit fluid flow through the
coupling. When the nozzle and the receptacle are to be uncoupled, the actuator
mechanism closes the nozzle valve and permits a spring to close the receptacle valve,
so that fluid cannot flow through the nozzle or through the receptacle when the nozzle
and receptacle are uncoupled.Patent Specification DE-A-1 475 880 discloses a valve in a fluid flow passage,
an interface sealing surface surrounding the passage, forming part of a housing and
being axially movable and a valve actuator, the valve having two valve surfaces and
the actuator including a carrier axially movable in the fluid passage with a valve seat
forming one of the valve surfaces provided on the carrier for axial movement
therewith and with the interface sealing surface being mounted on the carrier.Patent Specification US-A-3 664 634 shows a somewhat similar arrangement
but there the interface sealing surface is provided on a sleeve but the sleeve is not
used to open the valve assembly.As used herein, the term cryogenic fluid means a fluid that is at a temperature
at or below -101째C (-150째F).According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a valved coupling
comprising a nozzle and a receptacle which can be coupled together or uncoupled and
separated and each having a housing, a fluid flow passage extending through said
housings, a respective valve in each of said nozzle and said receptacle in said fluid
flow passage axially movable between opened positions permitting fluid flow through
said passage and closed positions preventing fluid flow through said passage, an
interface sealing surface provided on one of and located between said nozzle and said
receptacle, surrounding said passage and axially movable between an opened position
and a closed position, the
