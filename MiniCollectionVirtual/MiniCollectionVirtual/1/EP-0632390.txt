<ABSTRACT>
Known processor circuits such as PC cards in systems such as 
personal computers for linkage with an ISDN are suitable for modem 

applications if, between a 68302 processor on the processor circuit and a PC 
processor, there is located a receiving/transmitting circuit for converting 

parallel information into serial information and vice versa, as it is very simple 
for the 68302 processor to interpret commands such as, for example, Hayes 

commands, which are to be received from the PC processor via the receiving/transmitting 
circuit. The processor circuit according to the invention 

also comprises dual memory means which are located between the 68302 
processor and the PC processor and wherewith it becomes simpler to perform 

error diagnoses, which should take place frequently, particularly during test 
phases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a processor circuit comprising a first
processor and provided with a parallel address input and a parallel
data in/output, both for linkage to a second processor, and with a
serial in/output for linkage to a digital network, which first processor
is provided with
a first serial processor in/output which, via a converter circuit,
is linked to the serial in/output of the processor circuit, anda second serial processor in/output which, via a
receiving/transmitting circuit for converting parallel information
into serial information and vice versa, is linked to the parallel
address input and to the parallel data in/output.A processor circuit of this type is generally known. It can be, for
example, a personal computer card or PC card via which a PC processor
(the second processor) is linked to an ISDN network (the digital network).
On the PC card (the processor circuit) there is situated, for
example, a 68302 processor (the first processor), a first serial
processor in/output of which is linked via ISDN chips (the converter
circuit) to a serial in/output of the PC card for connection to the
ISDN network, and a second serial processor in/output of which is
linked, via a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter, the
receiving/transmitting circuit for converting parallel information
into serial information and vice versa), to a parallel address
in/output and to a parallel data in/output of the PC card. These two
in/ outputs can be linked to the PC processor. Such a PC card is
eminently suitable for modem applications, as it is very simple for
the 68302 processor to interpret the commands, such as, for example,
Hayes commands, which are to be received from the PC processor via the
UART.This known processor circuit has the drawback that it is relatively
difficult in a processor circuit of this type to perform error 
diagnoses, which should take place frequently, particularly during
test phases.One of the objects of the invention
as defined by independent claims 1 and 5
is to provide a processor circuit
with error diagnosis being
simpler.To this end, the processor circuit according to the invention is
characterized in that the processor circuit comprises dual access
memory means which are provided with
a first parallel address input which is linked to a parallel address
output of the first processor,a first parallel data in/output which is linked to a parallel data
in/output of the first processor,a second parallel address input which is linked to the parallel
address input of the
