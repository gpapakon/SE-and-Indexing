<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing the amount of microfoam in a spray-applied waterborne 
polymeric composition is provided, wherein a gas, such as, for example, carbon dioxide, 

having a solubility factor greater than one is used in spraying the waterborne composition. 
Articles so coated are also provided. And, a method for increasing the density of a spray-dried 

waterborne polymeric composition is provided, wherein a gas, such as, for example, carbon 

dioxide, having a solubility factor greater than one is used in spray-drying the waterborne 
composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for reducing the formation of microfoam in spray-applied,
waterborne polymeric compositions.The invention further concerns the use of a gas having a solubility factor of greater
than one as the carrier gas in the spray application of a waterborne polymeric
composition. Waterborne polymeric compositions, such as clear or pigmented coatings, are
frequently applied to substrates by spraying techniques. Some of the common
spraying techniques used are, for example, air spray, airless spray, air-assisted
airless spray, disc and bell spray, and high volume low pressure spray. In air spray,
compressed air is used to atomize the waterborne polymeric composition and to
assist in conveying the droplets to the substrate. In airless, disc, and bell spray
techniques the waterborne polymeric composition is atomized by mechanical means
and the droplets are suspended in air on formation. Air-assisted airless spray is a
hybrid of the two and involves the use of air as a carrier gas to convey spray
droplets which are formed mechanically. High volume, low pressure spray is
another commonly recognized variant of air spray. In each case, air is involved
either in the atomization of the polymeric composition, or in the conveyance of the
droplets to the target substrate or both.As a result of the spraying technique, coatings formed by spray-applying
waterborne polymeric compositions onto the surface of a substrate frequently
contain microfoam which remains in the dried film and detracts from the
appearance of the film, particularly from the appearance of clear, or unpigmented,
film.It is the object of the present invention to reduce the amount of microfoam in
spray-applied, waterborne polymeric compositions.In the prior art, US-A-4,842,900 discloses a method and apparatus for coating
a liquid coating composition onto a moving web and in which air entrained on the
web is replaced by a gas having a higher solubility in the liquid coating 
composition than air, such as, for example, carbon dioxide.US-A-3,661,605 discloses an aqueous aerosol composition comprising a
homogenized dispersion of lecithin in water and pressurised carbon dioxide or
nitrous oxide as the propellant. The composition is used to produce release coatings
of lecithin on a surface of a substrate.US-A-4,869,878 discloses a device for the creation of an oxygen-free working
atmosphere in applications where molten metal or ceramic is spray applied to a
workpiece and which makes use of, for example, combustion gas either as the
propel
