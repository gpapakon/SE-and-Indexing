<ABSTRACT>
A production control system for electronic devices
manufactured through many stages including plural

apparatuses comprises dispatching rule storing means, a
statistical analyzer and a simulator. The dispatching rule

storing means stores plural dispatching rules including a
first-in first-out rule, three of lot selective rules and

dead line rule. The statistical analyzer accumulates status
data representing the status of each of apparatuses and lots

to be processed for a fixed period of time, and generates a
statistical data by statistically processing the status data

as accumulated. The simulator simulates the production line
to evaluate an efficiency thereof based on the statistical

data and each one of the plural dispatching rules. An
optimum dispatching rule is selected which provides the

optimum efficiency for the production line among the plural
dispatching rules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a production control 
system for manufacturing various types of electronic devices 
through various kinds of stages in which a plurality of 
apparatuses of the same kind operate for processing the 
devices. In conventional production control systems for 
manufacturing electronic devices of various types, productive 
instruction data are determined based on a state of a 
production line predicted by a simulator, or else productive 
instruction data are determined by an expert system in which 
know-how of experts for efficiently operating the production 
line is stored as a knowledge base. These systems are 
intended to solve a problem of how to convert collected 
status data of the production line into productive 
instruction data. These systems are introduced because such 
a conversion cannot be attained by a simple algorithm in the 
case of production of electronic devices which involves a  
 
large number of and many kinds of stages, many kinds of 
orders of stages, and many kinds of manners of processing in 
the equipment through which lots of devices pass. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional 
production control system for manufacturing electronic 
devices. An example of such a production control system is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2-224954. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the production control system 
comprises data collecting means 12 for collecting status 
data, such as current operating conditions and progress of 
production, from a production line 11 including a variety of 
apparatuses assigned for a plurality of stages including 
stage 1 trough stage n, productive instruction data 
inputting means 31 for inputting productive instruction data 
such as designation of type and quantity of product to be 
manufactured, and a central processing unit 32 which has an 
expert system 33 including a knowledge base 35 containing 
accumulated know-how of experts and a simulator 34 for 
predicting operating conditions at an arbitrary future point 
of time and which receives external data from the productive 
instruction data inputting means 31 and from the data 
collecting means 12 to create and transmit a new productive 
instruction data for the production line 11 via 
communicating means 13. The expert system 33 creates appropriate productive  
 
instruction data from data, which are obtained from the data 
collecting means 12 and from the productive instruction data 
inputting means 31, on the basis of know-how of experts 
accumulated in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A production control system for a production line 
including at least one apparatus for each of a plurality of 

stages in said production line to manufacture lots of 
products, comprising: 


data collecting means (12) for collecting status data 
each representing a status of said at least one apparatus (21) 

and data on lots to be processed; 
a data analyzer (14) for accumulating the status data 
for a predetermined period of time to generate statistical 

data periodically by statistically processing said status 
data; 
a simulator (15) having at least one simulation model 
receiving said statistical data for simulating periodically 

at least a portion of said production line (11) to evaluate 
an efficiency thereof based on each of a plurality of 

dispatching rules for said lots of products; and 
dispatching means (16) for selecting an optimum 
dispatching rule among said plurality of dispatching rules 

based on the result of the simulation by said simulator to 
provide productive instruction data to said production 

line (11). 
A production control system as defined in Claim 1  
 

wherein said certain period of time ranges between about one 
week and about one month. 
A production control system as defined in Claim 1 or 2 
wherein said plurality of dispatching rules includes a 

first-in first-out rule, at least one lot selective rule and 
a dead line rule. 
A production control system as defined in one of Claims 
1 through 3 wherein said dispatching means replaces first 

productive instruction data now effective by second 
productive instruction data when a new selected optimum 

dispatching rule is different from a previously selected 
optimum dispatching rule.
