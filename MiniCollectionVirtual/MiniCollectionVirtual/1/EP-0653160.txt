<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of combating fungus which 
comprises treating plants subject to or subjected to fungal attack, 

seeds of such plants or the medium in which such plants are growing 
or are to be grown with the Z-isomer of 4-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acryloyl]
morpholine 
or with a composition 

comprising a carrier and, as active ingredient, the said Z-isomer; 
and the use of the Z-isomer as a fungicide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of combating fungus using 
the Z-isomer of dimethomorph. Dimethomorph is the common name for a mixture of the E- and 
Z-isomers of 4-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acryloyl]morpholine. 
This compound, which is covered by 
EP 0120321, is a fungicide which is effective in the control of 
plant diseases caused by Oomycetes, particularly those caused by 
members of the family Peronosporaceae and the genus Phytophthora 
but not Pythium, in vines, potatoes and tomatoes. In Brighton Crop Protection Conference, 1988, 17-24 it is 
reported that invitro tests on Phytophthorainfestans have shown 
that, if sunlight is excluded, only the Z-isomer of dimethomorph is 
fungitoxic. However, in the presence of light, isomerisation takes 
place with a fast equilibration to a Z:E ratio of about 80:20 and 
therefore, under field conditions, different ratios of E- and 
Z-isomers have been shown to be equally effective. It has now been discovered in tests on tomato plants that the 
Z-isomer of dimethomorph is much better absorbed by the roots and 
translocated into the leaves than the E-isomer resulting in about 5 
times higher initial concentrations of the Z-isomer in the leaves 
than the E-isomer. This is particularly surprising since the 
E-isomer has a much higher water solubility (30 mg/l) than the 
Z-isomer (7 mg/l) and a more favourable log p value (which 
indicates the distribution of a compound in a water/octanol system) 
regarding systemic uptake of a fungicide of 2.63 at 20Â°C compared 
to 2.73 for the Z-isomer. Moreover, the tests also showed that the 
concentration of Z-isomer in the leaves is much higher than the 
concentration of Z-isomer in the solution applied to the plant 
thereby indicating an accumulation of the Z-isomer in the green  
 
plant. Consequently, if pure Z-isomer is applied in conditions 
which substantially exclude sunlight, lower amounts of Z-isomer are 
required than of the E/Z mixture to achieve the same fungicidal 
effect and the effect is achieved quicker. This is clearly 
advantageous from both an economic and ecological point of view. According to the present invention there is therefore provided 
a method of combating fungus which comprises treating plants 
subject to or subjected to fungal attack, seeds of such plants or 
the medium in which such plants are growing or are to be grown with 
the Z-isomer of 4-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acryloyl]morpholine 
or with a composition comprising a carrier and, 
as active ingredient,

absence of light. 
A method according to claim 1 in which the Z-isomer or 
composition is applied to the roots of the plants. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 in whch the Z-isomer 
or composition is applied by means of a soil drench. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims in which 
the dose rate of the Z-isomer is in the range from 0.01 kg/ha to 10 

kg/ha. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims in which 
the fungus is 
Phytophthora
infestans
 or

viticola
. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims in which 
the Z-isomer is prepared by selective crystallisation of the 

Z-isomer from a solution containing a mixture of the E-isomer and 
Z-isomer and subsequent isomerisation of the remaining E-isomer to 

form a mixture of the E-isomer and Z-isomer.
