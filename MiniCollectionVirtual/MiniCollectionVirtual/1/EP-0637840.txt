<ABSTRACT>
Active circuitry is placed under the bond pads (3) in an integrated circuit 
having at least three metal levels (211, 215, 219). The metal level (215) adjacent the 

bond pad level acts as a buffer and provides stress relief and prevents crack 
propagation in the dielectric (213) that would otherwise lead to unacceptably large 

leakage currents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of integrated circuits and 
particularly to such integrated circuits in which at least a portion of the active 
circuitry is positioned under the bond pads. Although much public attention is given to aspects of integrated circuit 
technology, such as the number or dimensions of devices in the circuit and their 
operating speeds, because progress in these aspects has great public appeal, other 
aspects of integrated circuit technology are of equal importance to progress within 
the field of integrated circuits. For example, integrated circuits must be electrically 
contacted. The electrical circuit from the external pins of the integrated circuit 
package to the integrated circuit goes through bond pads which are located on the 
periphery of the integrated circuit. The bond pads are metal areas which are 
electrically connected to the devices in integrated circuit by buffers and electrically 
conducting interconnects. Due to conventional bonding technology used to, for 
example, attach wires to the bond pads and to design constraints, the bond pads have 
relatively large dimensions as compared to the device dimensions and occupy or 
cover a significant portion of the chip surface. The area underneath the bond pads 
thus occupies a substantial fraction of the entire chip surface. The electrical connection between the package and the bond pad 
requires physical integrity as well as high electrical conductivity. The conventional 
bonding process used to form the connection typically requires either or both 
elevated temperatures or high pressures to produce a good connection between the 
wire and the bond pad. If the bond pad is on a dielectric, the bonding conditions 
produce thermal and mechanical stresses in the dielectric. The stress may cause 
defects which result in large leakage currents through the dielectric between the bond 
pads and the underlying substrate, which is frequently electrically conducting. The 
leakage currents preclude use of the substrate area under the bond pads for device 
purposes thereby decreasing the efficiency of substrate utilization for device 
purposes. The buffers are typically located on the periphery of the integrated circuit 
and between bond pads to avoid placement under the bond pads; the spacing between 
bond pads must be increased to accommodate the buffers or other devices. Attempts have been made to use the substrate under the bond pads for 
active device purposes. Attempts have been made using conventional wire
