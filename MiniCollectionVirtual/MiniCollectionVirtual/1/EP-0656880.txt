<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chemical process and more particularly to 
an improved process for the preparation of methyl 2-(2-methylphenyl)-3--methoxypropenoate 
from methyl 2-methylphenylacetate. A process for preparing methyl 2-(2-methylphenyl)-3-methoxypropenoate 
by the formylation of methyl 2-methylphenylacetate and methylation of the 
methyl 2-formyl-(2-methylphenyl)acetate so formed, is described in 
EP-A-0203606. The formylation is carried out in absolute ether in the 
presence of sodium hydride. The formylated material is isolated and 
methylated with dimethylsulphate in acetone in the presence of potassium 
carbonate. Similar methods for preparing other compounds containing the 2-linked 
methyl 3-methoxypropenoate group are widely reported in recent patent 
literature beginning with EP-A-0178826. Mostly, the formylation and 
methylation steps are carried out separately, often in 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent. Methods of carrying out the two steps 
in a "one-pot" process are, however, also described in, for example, 
EP-A-0243012, EP-A-0480795, EP-A-0329011 and EP-A-0473980. In these 
methods DMF is again used as the solvent and sodium hydride or sodium 
methoxide as the base. In EP-A-0273572 a formylation method is described 
in which toluene is used as the solvent but the sodium salt of the 
formylated material is isolated before methylation in DMF. According to the present invention there is provided an improved 
process for the preparation of methyl 2-(2-methylphenyl)-3-methoxypropenoate 
which comprises contacting methyl 2-methylphenylacetate with 
methyl formate in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of an 
alkali metal base and a phase transfer catalyst, and thereafter 
methylating, without isolation, the product so formed in the presence of 
water. The aromatic hydrocarbon solvent used in the process of the invention 
is suitably an alkylbenzene, typically a methylbenzene, solvent, for 
example xylene or toluene. The alkali metal base is suitably an alkali metal alkoxide, typically 
a sodium or potassium C1-4 alkoxide, for example sodium methoxide, sodium 
ethoxide or sodium t-butoxide.  
 By the term "phase transfer catalyst" is meant a substance which, 
being at least partly present in or wetted by a first (usually organic) 
phase promotes reaction between a reactant in the first phase and a 
reactant which it transfers from a second (usually aqueous but sometimes 
solid) phase to the first phase. After reaction, the phase transfer 
catalyst is released for
