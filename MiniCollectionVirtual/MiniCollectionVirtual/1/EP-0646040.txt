<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for the
separation of particles, including micro-organisms, utilising
the phenomenon of dielectrophoresis.It is well known that dielectrically polarisable particles
in a non-uniform electrical field are subject, even if they have
no net charge, to a "dielectrophoretic" force if the effective
polarizability of the particles is different to that of the
surrounding medium. The movement is determined by the
dielectric properties (conductivity and permittivity) rather
than by the charge of the particles, as in the wider known
phenomenon of electrophoresis. The force F to which a particle
of volume v and effective polarizability p is subject is given
by the relation
F=pv(E.▿)E
where E is the electric field strength at the position of the
particle and ▿ is the del vector operator.In an alternating field in which the field strength at any
point is oscillatory but the field pattern remains stationary,
the dielectrophoretic force on a particle is oscillatory but
unidirectional, even though the electric field varies
cyclically. The particles, if they are polarisable more than
the medium in which they are suspended move in the direction of
increasing electric field strength which means, usually towards
one of a plurality of electrodes between which the field is
established. The polarizability of a particle, and therefore
the polarity and magnitude of the dielectrophoretic force upon
it, will vary as a function of the frequency of the applied
field because the dielectric properties of all materials have
characteristic frequency dependent components.Separators such as column separators employ a matrix to
retain the particles temporarily as they flow through the 
column; the retention time is dependent upon a physical property of the particle. As a
mixture of particles passes through the matrix different types of particles are retarded at
different rates and separate into fractions. In chromatographic separators the retardation
of the particles is caused by their size and in ion exchange separators the retardation of
particles is dependent upon their ionic strength. Electrophoretic separators rely on the
charge carried by the particles and neutral particles must first be given a charge before the
separation can occur. The charged particles are then passed through a matrix under the
influence of an electric field, which retards the different types of particles according to their
size and charge. In all of these separators the order in which the fractions are passed out
is

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for separating a mixture of particles in a suspension (6,7) by selective retardation of some
of the particles (6,7) comprising: a chamber (1) with an inlet (3) and an outlet (4),

means (5) for providing an eluant flow between said inlet (3) and said outlet (4), within the

chamber (1) an electrode structure (2) of at least two electrodes, (21,22) means (10) for
applying an alternating voltage between the electrodes (21,22), said electrode structure (2)

being such that when energized in operation of the apparatus, there is established in the
eluant a spatially non-uniform alternating field, whereby particles (6,7) caused to flow

through the chamber (1) in said eluant flow are carried past the electrode structure (2) and
are separated into fractions characterised in that an ancillary electrode structure,

is placed upstream of the main electrode structure (2), the ancillary electrode structure
being energised, in use, so as to collect the particles (6,7) together, the ancillary

electrode structure then being de-energised so that said particles (6,7) can flow into the
chamber (1).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which means (5) to provide the eluant flow
through the chamber is a pump (5).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the means (5) to provide the eluant flow
through the chamber uses gravity.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which at least one of the electrodes
of the electrode structure (2) is comprised of one or more grid like structures (21,22).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4 in which the electrode structure (2) comprises
interleaved grid like structures (21,22), aligned to obstruct straight through flow.
Method for separating a mixture of particles (6,7) in a suspension using the apparatus
in claim 1, comprising the steps of: collecting together the particles in the mixture and

releasing the particles into a chamber by respectively energising/de-energising the ancillary
electrode structure; providing in the chamber (1) a spatially non-uniform

alternating electric field; providing a flow of eluant through the chamber and the field;
eluting a limited sample of said mixture with said eluant; passing the eluted sample through

the electric field; causing or permitting the different types of particles in the mixture to be
retarded differentially and producing a flow of fractions of different types of particles

separated by a flow of eluant. 
A method according to claim 6 for forming a uniform starting band at the head of the
electrode structure comprising passing a flow of particles in suspension through the

electrode structure, energizing said electrode structure for a defined length of time with a
voltage high enough to collect particles in an initial part of the electrode structure as a band

and then reducing the voltage, causing or permitting the band of collected particles to be
washed along the chamber for separation action.
Method as claimed in claim 7 in which the ancillary electrode structure (2) is
re-energised once the band of previously collected particles (6,7) has been washed off the

ancillary electrode structure.
A method according to claim 6 wherein a uniform starting band of mixture is formed
upstream of the said spatially non-uniform field by energising the ancillary electrode

structure for a length of time, with a voltage sufficiently high enough to collect particles
(6,7) in a starting band, then reducing the voltage, thereby causing or permitting the starting

band to be washed along the chamber (1) for separation.
Method as claimed in any of claims 6 to 9, including altering the frequency of the
non-uniform alternating electric field to alter the order in which the particles (6,7) are

separated.
Method as claimed in claim 10 including altering the frequency of the non-uniform
alternating electric field to alter the degree of separation between each of the fractions or

the discrete bands with a greater concentration of one particular type of particle to some
extent.
Method as claimed in claim 9 to 11 including switching the non-uniform alternating
electric field on and off to sharpen the fractions or the discrete bands with a greater

concentration of one particular type of particle (6,7).
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the chamber comprises a transparent
substrate, a layer of electrode material placed on said substrate, the electrode material

forming the electrode structure, a transparent cover
over the electrode material and separating means placed between the substrate and the

cover, said separating means and cover creating with the substrate a sealed channel over the
electrode structure with the inlet and the outlet, the chamber having, near said outlet, a path

through the channel for a beam (11) of electromagnetic radiation to pass without
obstruction from the electrode structure.
