<ABSTRACT>
The oil groove (lubricant channel) (10) formed on the bottom portion (31) of the chain guide groove (7,9), and the chain guide groove (9) may be constructed as one groove (7) which is subdivided by an insert floor (8,30) into the oil groove (10) and the chain guide groove (9), the insert floor (8) having outlet openings (12) for the lubricant. The insert floor (8) can, as a bar-shaped spring (20), be clamped between the two flanks of the groove (7) and connected, e.g. spot-welded, to the flanks. The groove (7) can be stepped and the insert floor (30) is able to rest on the step (29). The oil groove (10) can be formed by one or more insert pieces (33,34,35). The insert piece can be a pipe or flexible tube (32) with outlet openings (12). The insert piece can be a moulding (33) of metal or plastic containing the oil groove and may have a plurality of parts, and the insert floor or the insert piece can be interrupted, the interruptions forming the outlet openings. The oil groove (37) can be incorporated in the guide bar, an insert piece (38) or insert floor (43) inserted and thereabove the flanks (39) with the chain guide groove (40) subsequently formed.
