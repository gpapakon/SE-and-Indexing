<ABSTRACT>
A cube package of stacked silicon semiconductor chips. To 
accommodate cube packaging, a metal transfer layer is added 

over the passivated chip face (16) to bring all of the surface 
electrical contacts to a common chip edge. The metal transfer 

layer (9) is insulated from the chip face and from the 
adjacent chip in the stack by polymer layers (16) having a low 

dielectric constant, and a thermal expansion coefficient 
matching that of the stacked chips. An adhesive polymer layer 

is added to strengthen the bond between the first polymer 

layers and the adjacent chip in the stack, by deposition of 
the adhesive layer and partial cure at the wafer level, and 

then full cure when the chips are stacked together to form the 
cube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to the cube packaging of a
stack of semiconductor device chips and more particularly, to
such packaging using insulating and adhesive materials
permitting faster device operation, greater package
reliability and enhanced package compatibility with existing
semiconductor device processing techniques.As is well known, the so-called "cube" package is a number of
passivated device chips glued together in a stacked
configuration. Each chip may have an "off-the-shelf" design
layout including surface contact metallization. To
accommodate "cube" packaging, each such device chip
additionally is provided with a metal transfer layer over the
passivated chip face to bring all of the surface electrical
contacts to a common chip edge. Precise alignment of the
chips, during the stacking and gluing assembly, allows for the
bussing of all the common input-output lines on one or more
faces of the resulting cube structure.United States Patent 4,525,921, issued on July 2, 1985, to
John C. Carson et al. for "High Density Electronic Processing
Package Structure and Fabrication" discloses an early version
of cube packaging involving the use of specially routed chip-edge
contact metallization on each passivated chip face
avoiding the need for a metal rerouting layer. Silicon
dioxide is added to the backside of each chip to complete the
electrical isolation of the chips from each other in the
stack. The silicon dioxide-isolated chips are fixed to each
other by means of a bonding epoxy. The need for special chip-edge contact metallization routing
on each chip is eliminated in later U.S. Patent 5,104,820,
issued April 14, 1992, to Tiong C. Go et al. for "Method of
Fabricating Electronic Circuitry Unit Containing Stacked IC
Layers Having Lead Rerouting". A metal rerouting layer is
provided to accommodate the stacking of standard off-the-shelf
chips having conventional face mounted contact metallization.
The latter patent contemplates the use of certain ordinary
insulation films between the aforesaid two layers of
metallization as well as on the backside of each chip. Rather
than using exclusively oxide insulation between the chips as
in the case of patent 4,525,921, SiON also is suggested in
patent 5,104,820 for covering the upper (device side) surface
of each chip to isolate the original chip contact
metallization from the added rerouting metallization. Silicon
nitride is cited to cover the backside of each chip rather
than the silicon dioxide of patent 4,525,921. An epoxy
adhesive is used to fix
