<ABSTRACT>
When a metal strip material is cold 
rolled, roll cross rolling and roll parallel rolling 

are combined, and rolling is carried out by 
the roll parallel rolling system at at least the final 

stand (in the case of a tandem mill) or in 
at least the final pass (in the case of a single-stand 

mill such as reverse mill) to obtain a 
rolled metal strip free from torsion and having 

excellent luster. In some cases, preliminary 
cold rolling of a rolling reduction of at least 5 

% is in advance applied to a metal strip material 
by the roll cross system, and then cold 

rolling by the combination of roll parallel rolling 
or roll cross rolling and roll parallel rolling 

is carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cold rolling method for
a metal strip such as a steel strip, a stainless steel strip,
and the like and a mill array and in particular to a cold
rolling method in which cross rolling prevents torsion in the
material, thereby producing a metal strip having excellent
surface gloss, and a mill array to be used in the method.Recently, increasing demands have been made with
respect to the shape and thickness of rolled metal strips
(hereinafter referred to as "rolled strip"). Consequently,
in order to control a crown of the rolled strip, several
methods have been adopted in which a metal strip (hereinafter
referred to as "strip") is rolled by upper and lower work
rolls which cross in a plane parallel to the strip (hereinafter
referred to as "work cross rolling") or is rolled by
a pair of work roll and backup roll which cross in the plane
(hereinafter referred to as "pair-cross rolling"). These
cross rolling methods have already been widely introduced
in hot rolling since they exhibit excellent control ability.
However, if they are applied to cold rolling which requires
high dimensional accuracy, it is necessary to prevent the
rolled strip from twisting. In order to respond to demands
relating to a wide variety of strip, thicknesses, and widths,
a cold rolling mill with a high level of control is required. 
Although the cross rolling method is excellent with respect
to its control ability, it has not been satisfactorily used
in cold rolling due to the problem of torsion.The reason why torsion is caused in the rolled strip
by the cross rolling will be explained below by referring
to FIG. 4. FIG. 4(a) is an explanatory view illustrating
a torsion in the rolled strip 4 when the strip 3 is rolled
by a pair of upper and lower rolls 1 and 2 which are crossed
in a plane parallel to the strip 3. The rolled strip 4 is
pushed down at an edge side A and pushed up at an edge side B
during rolling by virtue of the position of the work rolls 1
and 2. This causes torsion in the rolled strip 4.FIG. 4(b) is an explanatory view illustrating a
torsion in the rolled strip 4 when the strip 3 is rolled
by cross rolling method. As shown in FIG. 4(b), the rolled
strip 4 is subjected to a shearing force F1 in the strip
width direction on the top side and to a shearing force F2
in the strip width direction on the bottom side due to the
fact that rotary axes of the work rolls 1 and 2 are not
perpendicular to a rolling direction X. This causes torsion
in the rolled strip 4. These torsions occur in opposing
direc
