<ABSTRACT>
A telephone subscriber circuit is coupled via a single 
galvanic isolation element (FD) to drive, from subscriber 

apparatus unconnected to the telephone line, the line 
hooking on/off and the transfer of signals thereto, and 

includes a speech circuit coupled to the line through a 
diode bridge circuit (D). 
Connected through a voltage-generating circuit means 
(Q5,R4) and level-translating circuit means (Q4,R5) to an 

output terminal of the galvanic isolation element, a 
photocoupler, are respectively an input terminal of the 

speech circuit and a control terminal of an electronic 
switch (Q1,Q2) connected between the speech circuit and the 

diode bridge circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telephone subscriber circuits,
specifically circuits which enable subscriber apparatus
drawing no power from a telephone line to be coupled to the
line.Such equipment as telephone answering systems or computer
terminals used in lieu of traditional phone sets require,
for proper handling of all their usual functions, to be
fully uncoupled electrically from the line.To enable the "decadic" functions of line hooking on/off,
or pulse sending, in order to call another subscriber, and
of voice signal transmitting in the hooked-on condition of
the line -- using apparatus which are powered separately
from the line -- to be performed, the electric uncoupling
is customarily ensured by such elements as relays,
transformers, or photocoupling devices.Prior approaches have used two discrete paths, quite simply
implemented by conventional techniques, to provide the
decadic line hook-on/off functions separately from the
voice signal transmission function during the line hook-on
step. Such is accomplished by means of two galvanic
isolation elements of the aforementioned kinds. The two
elements may be of two different types.A signal transmission circuit of a telephone system is described in the
UK Patent Application GB-A-2 250 661.The underlying technical problem of this invention is to
reduce the number of the components required in a telephone
subscriber circuit for driving a telephone line hooking-on/off
and transferring signals over the telephone line
from subscriber apparatus not powered through said line, by
omitting one of the two galvanic isolation elements
employed heretofore.This reduction in the number of components is desirable to 
bring down cost and the occupation of integration area
while improving reliability.This technical problem is solved by a telephone subscriber
circuit as outlined above and defined in the characterizing
parts of the appended claims to this specification.The features and advantages of a telephone subscriber
circuit according to the invention will be apparent from
the following description of an embodiment thereof, given
by way of example and not of limitation with reference to
the accompanying drawings.In the drawings:
Figure 1 shows a diagram, partly in block form, of a
telephone subscriber circuit according to the invention
which may be implemented in a technology of the bipolar
type; andFigure 2 shows a preferred embodiment of that same
theoretical diagram which may be implemented in a
technology of the MOS or mixed type.The circuit diagram shown in
