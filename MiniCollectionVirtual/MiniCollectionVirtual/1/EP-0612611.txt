<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a masking film consisting of 
one or more layers, to use when selectively lacquering parts 

of a surface, in particular of cars, with a polar outer layer. 
According to the invention the polar outer layer is usually a 

layer made from a polymer or copolymer or terpolymer, which is 
of itself permanently polar, without any pre- or post-treatment. 
Preferably the polar outer layer is an ionomer layer, 
formed from the reaction product of an acidic copolymer or an 

acidic terpolymer and a metal salt, and preferably from the 
reaction product of ethylene acrylic acid or ethylene methacrylic 

acid on the one hand and a sodium or zinc salt on the 
other hand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to
the use of
a masking film consisting of
one or more layers, with a polar external layer,
in particular of cars and to specified films for this use.Traditionally, when lacquering surface parts, in particular
of cars, one used paper because of its absorbing capacity.
The surface part covered with paper is masked, that is
to say, no paint or lacquer comes onto that part of the sheet-metal.
However, the disadvantage of using paper is that it has
to be very strong and of high quality. If paper is too thin,
the paint or lacquer, usually applied by spraying, can penetrate
to the parts of the sheet-metal which are supposed to be
masked or protected. Because of these high quality requirements
the costs for the paper are relatively high. Another
disadvantage attached to the use of paper is the fact that
paper saturated with lacquer cannot be reused for paper production,
as the paper is saturated with chemicals from the
lacquer. Therefore the paper with lacquer and all must be
thrown away, which is a burden on the environment.Later on plastic foils were used, which in the beginning
were mainly used to keep parts of the bodywork dust free
and free of lacquer. Such foils are not suitable as masking
film when lacquering as such, because when removing the foil,
the lacquer which has come onto the foil will flake off, and
flakes may land on the newly lacquered part, necessitating
post-treatment.EP-A-0434180 (Tredegar Industries) discloses a film
coating for rigid, smooth surfaces consisting of a
multilayer masking film having a smooth side and an embossed
side.
The film has one external thermoplastic adhesiveless film layer
which may, among others, consist of an acid-modified, an
anhydride-modified or an acid/acrylate-modified copolymer. In order to avoid the disadvantage of the flaking of
the lacquer layer which has come onto the foil, it was suggested
in the European patent specification EP 277 552 to subject
the masking film before use to a corona treatment, so that the
lacquer adheres to the foil to the extent that flaking is
avoided. A suitable corona pre-treatment has an effect on the
surface tension in the sense that the printing inks and lacquer
paints adhere very well. In such a treatment of a crystalline
plastic foil without lubricant, for instance high density
polyethene (HDPE), a surface tension of 45 dynes/cm can be
achieved. It has been shown that with such a treatment the
foil could be used for masking purposes for several months. However, the described prior art has the
