<ABSTRACT>
In order to extend the field of application of roller-type furnaces, which is limited by the load-bearing capacity of the rollers fitted, the invention proposes that the internal stresses in the rollers, due to the inherent weight of and the load on the rollers, be reduced by applying bending moments at the ends (4) of the rollers, preferably by inserting, in the ends of the rollers, rods (1) on which weight are mounted in such a way that they can be displaced.

Roller kiln --- for example for the hardening of samples 
made of metal or for the firing of porcelain, 

ceramics, pottery, tiles, bricks or similar at temtemperatures 
of the order of magnitude of 1.000 degrees 

Celsius or more --- with rollers, roller holders, 
roller bearings, a drive system and a drive transfer 

system whereby on the drive's side of the roller kiln 
all of the components needed for the drive transfer 

system are located above or below the plane determined 
by the sequence of rollers (4) and whereby at 

each respective end at one or both sides of the 
rollers an adjustable bending moment can be applied 

for the reduction of the internal stresses in the 
rollers within the kiln by means of a weight which can 

be fixed at the respective rollers' ends whereby its 
weight distribution in the area outside and possibly 

inside the roller bearing (16) is performed such as 
to make the resulting bending moment attack outside 

the roller bearing (16). 
Roller kiln according to claim 1 wherein the weight 
consists of a rod (1) which with positive engagement 

is sticked into the hollow rollers. 
Roller kiln according to claim 2 wherein additional 
sliding weights are attached. 
Roller kiln as in claims 2 or 3 wherein the applicable 
bending moments at least reach the values 


when applied single-sided

Rollen kiln as in claim 2 wherein the inner side of 
the hollow roller has a grinding which is at least 

as long as the shaft (2) of the rod (1) and which 
limits the tolerance of the roller's inner diameter 

(6) to several tenths of a millimetre. 
Roller kiln as in claim 2 wherein the shafts (2) of 
the rods (1) sticking in the hollow rolls (4) bear 

at their surface an additional layer of ceramics with 
a hardness similar to or bigger than the hardness of 

the roller (4) itself. 
Roller kiln as in claims 2 or 3 wherein the rods (1) 
show a calibration for the bending moments achieved 

with respect to the position of the additional 
weight (9). 
Roller kiln as in claim 1 wherein in the device 
for holding a roller which can be connected rigidly 

with this device, i.e. in the roller holder, at the 
front side a centered circular aperture is provided 

the diameter of which is at least as large as the 
inner diameter (6) of the roller (4).
