<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to
supercritical fluid extraction. More specifically, the
present invention is related to an automated
supercritical fluid extraction and collection system.Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is a
sample preparation technique used to extract analytes of
interest from a sample, for example, environmental
pollutants from a soil sample. Some type of sample
preparation must be performed for a wide range of
environmental, food, polymer, petroleum, pharmaceutical
and other classes of samples due to the complex nature of
the samples. Many of these samples are so complex that
they cannot be directly analyzed by analytical techniques
such as gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography
(LC). The complex samples must first go through a sample
preparation step to perform a gross separation of the
analytes of interest from the sample matrix in which they
are contained, for example, the environmental pollutants
from soil. After the sample preparation step, then just
the analytes of interest are analyzed by the analytical
technique such as gas chromatography (GC), liquid
chromatography (LC), or supercritical fluid
chromatography (SFC). Other analytical techniques could
be used such as mass spectroscopy (MS) or nuclear
magnetic resource (NMR).The most popular sample preparation steps are
Soxhlet extraction and liquid extraction. An alternative 
to these types of extraction techniques is supercritical
fluid extraction (SFE). SFE offers a relatively rapid,
simple and inexpensive technique to perform sample
preparations. The basis of SFE is that a fluid, such as
carbon dioxide, is held at a specific pressure,
temperature and flowrate, which is above its critical
temperature and pressure and thus is a supercritical
fluid. The supercritical fluid is passed through the
sample matrix containing the analytes of interest. This
sample matrix is contained in an extraction vessel. The
fluid diffuses into the pores of the matrix, solubilizes
the analytes of interest, and then carries the analytes
away from the matrix. The analytes are then collected by
some device, so that the analytes can be analyzed by some
further analytical technique, such as chromatography.
The matrix (now without analytes) is left behind in the
extraction vessel. Supercritical fluids have favorable
diffusivities and viscosities providing for good mass
transfer characteristics. Their solvent strength can be
easily controlled by changing fluid pressure or
temperature. These are but a few of the advantages of
supercritical

An apparatus (20) as described in Claim 26

characterized by
 the fact that there is a cooling unit
(112) which maintains the fraction collection carousel

(66) at a desired temperature, said cooling unit (112)
disposed adjacent to and in thermal communication with

the fraction collection carousel (66). 
A system (10) as described in Claim 33

characterized by
 the fact that the extraction chamber
assembly (18) has thermal insulation (54) to retain heat

in the supercritical fluid when it enters the extraction
chamber assembly (18) to solubilize analyte in the

matrix therein.
A system (10) as described in Claim 14

characterized by
 the fact that the extraction chamber
assembly (18) has pressure retaining means (40) able to

withstand pressure up to 680 atm, and an extraction
vessel within the extraction chamber assembly (18) is

contained by the pressure retaining means (40), said
extraction vessel (16) made of a material not able to 

independently withstand pressure greater than 50 atm.
A system (10) as described in Claim 58

characterized by
 the fact that the extraction vessel
(16) is porous.
A system (10) as described in Claim 59

characterized by
 the fact that the extraction vessel
(16) is made of teflon, PEEK, stainless steel, plastic

or paper.
A system (10) as described in Claim 6

characterized by
 the fact that the automated variable
restrictor (22) defines a channel (65) therethrough, a

portion (67) of said channel (65) having a variable
inner diameter, and wherein the supercritical fluid

includes modifier concentrations as great as 50%, said
variable inner diameter of said channel (65) adaptable

to allow the fluid through the channel (65) without
clogging.
