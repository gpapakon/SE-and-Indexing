<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for forming multi-valued 
linear resistors for an integrated circuit using a single 

mask level. A plurality of trenches are defined in a 
substrate. Each trench has contact regions of a specific 

lateral dimension and a narrower portion extending 
therebetween. Successive conformal layers of a first 

dielectric layer (50), a first conductive layer (70) of high 
resistivity and a second conductive layer (80) of lower 

resistivity are provided to fill the trench. The amount of 
the second conductive layer which fills the trench depends 

on the width of the trench. The resulting structure is 
planarized, preferably by chemical-mechanical polishing to 

provide fully planarized topography. Advantageously when 
the first and second conductive layers are provided from 

layers of undoped and doped polysilicon respectively, the 
trench dimensions control the amount of dopant incorporated 

in each region of the trench. After annealing to diffuse 
dopant, the wider end contact regions are heavily doped to 

form contact regions, and the intermediate narrow portion 

of the trench is doped to a level dependent on the width of 
the trench, thereby forming a resistive element having a 

resistivity inversely dependent on the trench width. The 
method is compatible with CMOS, Bipolar and Bipolar CMOS 

processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to resistors for integrated circuits and a method of forming
resistors.Multi-valued linear resistors are required for applications in integrated
circuits, including for example, for static random access memory (SRAM) circuits,
monolithic filters, and fusible links for programmable read only memories or
redundant circuits. In a known method of providing a linear resistor for a MOS,
Bipolar, or Bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) silicon integrated circuit, a layer of polysilicon
is deposited over a thick layer of dielectric, for example a field oxide provided on a
silicon substrate. The polysilicon layer is patterned to define a resistor structure and
then selectively doped by ion implantation. Typically, the polysilicon resistor
structure comprises heavily doped end regions forming contact electrodes, and a
resistive region extending between the contact regions which is doped sufficiently to
provide a desired resistance value. The latter method of fabricating resistors is applicable to forming either n- or
p- type ohmic resistors, particularly low and medium valued resistors for applications
in MOS and bipolar digital and analog ICs, which are typically formed. Resistors in
the low to medium resistance value ranges (i.e. 10-1000 ohm/sq) are linear over a
wide voltage range. High value (gigaohm) leakage current resistors, used for
example in applications for high density static random access memories (SRAMS),
are more difficult to fabricate reproducibly, because undoped or lightly doped
polysilicon is required to obtain high resistivities. The latter is more susceptible to
process induced damage and defects, which degrade quality, create leakage and lead
to poor reliability.More significantly, for a process to provide multi valued linear resistors on an
integrated circuit, the resistive portion of each resistor of a different value requires a
separate implantation step, with a different dopant dose, to provide a different
doping level. Thus multiple photoengraving steps are required, and the number of
masks depends on the number of different values of resistors required.The present invention seeks to provide a method of forming resistor
structures for integrated circuits and a resistor structure which avoids the above
mentioned problems, and with particular application to providing multi-valued linear
resistors by a process with a reduced number of photoengraving steps.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method
of forming a resistive element for an integrated
