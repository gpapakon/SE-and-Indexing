<ABSTRACT>
A paper-plastic laminate sheeting capable of being converted by 
conventional equipment into envelopes, grocery bags and other dilatable 

container products that initially are in a flat state and are normally 
made of paper. The sheeting is composed of a paper facing sheet (10) 

cold-laminated by means of a water-based adhesive (11) to a reinforcing 
film of synthetic plastic material (12), such as polypropylene. The film 

is oriented to impart exceptional tear and burst strength 
characteristics to the resultant waterproof product. The product, whose 

exterior surface is formed by the paper facing sheet, is readily 
printable. For some applications, a second paper facing sheet is 

cold-laminated to the other side of the film to produce a three-ply 
laminate sheeting whose exposed surfaces are readily printable and can 

accept conventional adhesives.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to paper-plastic
laminate sheeting and to a process for making such
sheeting, the sheeting being capable of being
converted into envelopes, bags and other dilatable
container products which initially are in a flat state
and are normally made of paper.The sheeting traditionally used in making
envelopes, grocery bags and other types of dilatable
container products which initially are in a flat state
is paper. Paper is a semi-synthetic material made by
chemically processing cellulose fibers.Apart from its low cost, an important advantage
of paper is that it can be converted into envelopes
and other types of dilatable container products by
means of high speed equipment that functions to cut
and fold the sheeting into the desired configuration,
the folds and flaps of the product being bonded
together, where necessary, by standard low-cost
adhesives. Another advantage of paper in this context
is that it can readily be printed and colored, using
standard inks for this purpose.But such paper products suffer from several
disadvantages, for they are characterized by low tear
and burst strength, and are by no means water
resistant; for unless coated, paper is highly
absorbent.Also well known in the art are plastic-coated
cellulosic papers, these being used chiefly in 
children's books, posters, signs and shipping tags,
and for other purposes demanding resistance to hard
wear and to outdoor exposure. However, such
plastic-coated papers lack high tear and burst
strength. Also low in strength are special purpose
coated papers covered on one or both sides with a
suspension of clays, starches, rosin or wax, or a
combination of these substances.To overcome the drawbacks of paper-fabricated
dilatable container products, in recent years such
products have been made of TYVEC or other polymeric
synthetic plastic sheeting. The resultant products
not only have a tear and bursting strength far
superior to paper, but they are also waterproof.However, TYVEC and similar synthetic plastic
sheeting is difficult to convert into envelopes and
other dilatable container products using high-speed
equipment of the type mainly suitable for paper. As
a consequence, production scrap rates can run as high
as thirty percent, thereby raising the cost of
manufacturing these products. Moreover, such plastic
sheeting has a low chemical affinity for standard
adhesives; hence in the case of envelopes, one must
then use a special and more costly adhesive on the
flaps. And such plastic sheeting also has a low
affinity

<CLAIMS>
A process for making a paper-plastic laminate sheeting (S) which
comprises supplying a web of paper (10,16) and a web of an oriented plastics

film (12,18); energising one surface of the plastic film (12,18) to increase its
dynes and its affinity for adhesives; coating the energised surface of the plastic

film (12,18) with a water-based adhesive (11); and cold-laminating the coated
plastic film (12,18) to the first web of paper (10,16) to form said laminate

sheeting (S), the entire process being carried out at a temperature which does
not impair the orientation properties of the plastics film (12,18).
The process of claim 1, which further comprises supplying a second
web of paper; energising the other surface of the plastics film (12,18) to

increase its dynes and its affinity for adhesives; coating said other energised
surface of the plastics film (12,18) with a water-based adhesive (11); and

cold-laminating the coated plastics film (12,18) to the second web of paper to
form the laminate (S) without impairing the orientation properties of the

plastics film (12,18) whereby the plastics film (12,18) is sandwiched between
the first and second webs of paper (10,16). 
The process of claim 1 or 2, wherein the energisation of the plastics
film surface is effected by exposing the film surface to ionizing radiation.
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the cold-laminating step is
conducted by compressing the coated plastics film (12,18) and the respective

paper web (10,16) between compression rollers (13,14); and wherein the coated
surface of the plastics film (12,18) does not contact the paper web (10,16) until

they meet in the nip of the compression rollers (13,14).
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the adhesive (11) is coated
on the surface of the film (12) in the form of parallel strips, or as a layer upon

the entire surface.
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the first and/or second web
of paper (10,16) is Kraft paper or coated paper.
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the plastics film (12,18) is
uniaxially or biaxially oriented and is formed of polypropylene, polyethylene,

nylon or a polyester such as MYLAR.
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the adhesive (11) includes
a polyacrylate copolymer. 
A system for producing a laminate sheeting (S) by a cold-lamination
process as set forth in any of the preceding claims, said system comprising:


a combining station provided with a set of pressure rolls (13,14) having
an adjustable nip therebetween;
means feeding a web of paper (16) drawn from a supply reel (17)
through said nip;
means feeding a web of synthetic oriented plastics film material (18)
drawn from a supply reel (19) through said nip, whereby pressure is applied to

the facing inner surfaces of the film web (18) and the paper web (10);
an adhesive coating station (22) in advance of the nip for coating the inner
surface of the film web (18) with a water-based adhesive (11);
an ionization bar (21) in advance of the adhesive coating station (22) for
energising and increasing the dynes on the inner surface of the synthetic plastics

film material web (18) and thereby increasing its affinity for the adhesive (11);
and
means (15) driving the combining rolls (13,14) so as to cause said paper
and synthetic plastics film material webs (16,18) to advance concurrently

through the combining station;

   
characterised in that
 said combining station effects cold-lamination of
the webs (16,18) at such a temperature that the orientation of said synthetic

oriented plastics film material is not impaired.

each stage being a system as set forth in claim 9, the first stage of which in

operation yields a paper-film laminate sheeting which in operation of the second
stage is cold-laminated to a paper web to produce a three-ply sheeting (S) in

which the film web (12,18) is sandwiched between paper webs (10,16).
