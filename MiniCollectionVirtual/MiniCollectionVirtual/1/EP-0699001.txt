<ABSTRACT>
An image signal compression transmission 
system for transmitting and receiving a compressed image 

signal, having a transmitter section (1, 2, 4, 6) which 
entropy codes digitized image data for transmission, a 

transmission channel (8) through which codes sent from 
said transmitter section are transmitted, and a receiver 

section (10, 11, 14, 12') which decodes said entropy-coded 
codes received from said transmission channel (8) 

are derives an original digital image signal. In the 
transmitter section, digital image data is entropy 

coded. The entropy-coded codes are transmitted to the 
receiver section through the transmission channel. In 

the receiver section, the received codes are entropy 
code decoded at a decoding speed corresponding to a 

transmission rate on the transmission channel. 
Coefficient codes derived by the decoding are stored 

into a memory (14) at the same speed as the decoding 
speed. Then, the coefficient codes are read from the 

memory at a same speed different from the decoding 
speed, but the same speed as a signal processing rate in 

a signal processing system subsequent to the memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to techniques 
for transmitting compressed digital image data signals 
and reproducing original digital image data from the 
transmitted compressed image data signals. 
Particularly, the present invention relates to an image 
data ignal compression/transmission system and an image 
data signal compression/transmission method, wherein a 
digital image data signal may be entropy coded to 
reduce its data amount on the transmission side, and 
the entropy-coded data signal may be decoded to a 
reproduced image data signal, on the reception side, 
which is maintained substantially in a real time 
relationship with the image data signal on the 
transmission side, and a reception method and a 
receiver suitable for image data signals used in a 
transmission system as mentioned above. Referring first to Fig. 2, a transmitter in 
an image data signal compression/transmission system is 
illustrated in a block diagram form. In Fig. 2, the transmitter is composed of a 
scan convertor 1; a hybrid coding unit 2; an entropy 
coding unit 4; and a transmission buffer memory 6 
(hereinafter referred to as the transmission buffer).  
 
A transmission channel 8 is provided for transmitting 
signals sent from the transmitter section therethrough. Image data, which is a digitized image data 
signal, is inputted to the scan convertor 1 in which 
the image data is subjected to scan conversion and then 
outputted to the hybrid coding unit 2. The scan 
conversion performed in the scan convertor 1 converts 
the image data in a scan format similar to that of 
ordinary television signals to data in a different scan 
format which facilitates the coding processing in the 
hybrid coding unit 2. The scan-converted image data is coded by the 
hybrid coding unit 2 to coefficient codes which are 
then outputted to the entropy coding unit 4. An 
example of a normal configuration for moving image data 
signal compression encoding is the one defined by ITU-R 
Recommendation (former CCIR recommendation) 723. In 
this description the hybrid coding scheme is assumed to 
be a combination of a transform coding and a predictive 
coding scheme in the configuration indicated by ITU-R 
Recommendation 723. The hybrid coding will be briefly described 
below. There are numerous kinds of image coding 
algorithms for compressing image information. Examples 
of such algorithms include predictive coding which 
utilizes intra-frame correlation and inter-frame 
correlation, transform coding such as DCT (Discrete  
 
Cosine
