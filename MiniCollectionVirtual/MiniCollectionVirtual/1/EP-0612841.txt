<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a fabric softening 
clay for control and prevention of pilling caused by 
washing and use of fabrics. The phenomenon of pilling of fabrics is well known. It is 
caused by rubbing the fabrics and fibres, both in use, 
referred to as the wear cycle, and during the washing 
process, referred to as the wash cycle. The rubbing 
causes fibres to migrate within the fabric structure and 
tends to increase the number of fibres, "fuzz fibres" 
protruding from the fabric surface. This results in the 
formation of surface fuzz. Continued rubbing causes 
damage to, and entanglement of, those "fuzz fibres" to 
form "pills" or "fuzz balls". The occurrence of pills on 
fabrics is very common and the unsightly appearance gained 
thereby is associated with old age and hard wear although 
the problem may, in fact, develop quickly on a new 
garment. Pilling often leads to an article or garment 
being discarded. Pilling is particularly a problem on 
knitted fabrics; especially those comprising long staple 
fibres such as wool, mohair etc.  
 Attempts have been made to solve the problem of pilling by 
bonding fibres of a textile together as part of an 
industrially applied textile treatment usually by a 
process of impregnating the fibres with a polymer followed 
by crosslinking the polymer in-situ to form a bonded 
whole. Such or similar processes are described in EP-A-311 
642, EP-A-190 672, US-A-4 225 646 and US-A-4 098 701. An 
alternative solution is to ion-irradiate animal yarns 
before or after spinning as described in JP-A-61047836. The disadvantages of these industrial processes are that 
they often require high temperatures or direct application 
of the composition to the textile, for example by padding, 
which makes them inappropriate for the treatment of 
articles or garments as part of a domestic process. 
Furthermore, they are often ineffective as is shown by the 
ready occurrence of pills on so-called treated textiles. 
This is probably due to the composition, which has been 
deposited on the fibres during the treatment, being 
washed off or worn off as the article is used and cleaned. WO-A-89/04862 relates to a detergent composition for 
cleaning and softening fabrics in which cellulase 
granulates containing calcium carbonate are used in 
certain combinations with a fabric softening clay to wash 
cotton swatches. A composition comprising cellulase and 
clay is said to improve the appearance of the cotton 
fabric by improved colour and anti-pilling performance.
