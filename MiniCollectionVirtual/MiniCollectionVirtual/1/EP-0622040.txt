<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hot drinks machine, especially a coffee percolator, with a filter holder (4) provided with at least one liquid outlet (11), an antidrip means (12) having a return means (16) and a closure valve (15) for closing, in the return position, said liquid outlet (11), said antidrip means (12) comprising a first means (20) for controlling the position of the antidrip means that can be operated automatically by the pourer when the pourer is positioned on the percolator in order to open said outlet (11). The antidrip means has a movable plate (14) and has a second means (20a) for controlling the position of the antidrip means that can be operated, preferably by hand, in order to bring said antidrip means into a stable position away from said liquid outlets (11) and keep it away.

<CLAIMS>
A hot-drinks machine, in particular a coffee machine, including a
housing (1) with a filter holder (4) provided with at least one fluid

outlet (11), and anti-drip means (12) associated with return means
(16) and with a closure valve (15) for closing said fluid outlet (11)

in the return position, said anti-drip means (12) comprising first
position-control means (20) for controlling the position of the anti-drip

means (12), and capable of being actuated automatically by the
coffeepot in order to disengage said outlet (11) when said coffeepot

is placed on the machine, and second position-control means (20a) for
controlling the position of the anti-drip means (12), and capable of

being actuated, preferably manually, in order to bring said anti-drip
means (12) into a stable position in which it disengages said fluid

outlets (11), and to hold it there,

   the machine being characterized in that the anti-drip means
(12) comprises a tray (14) which is movably mounted on the filter

holder (4) to pivot about a pivot axis (13) which is parallel to the
plane in which the fluid outlets (11) extend, the second control

means (20a) being constituted by a wheel (21) or lever secured to the
filter holder (4), and including an inclined ramp (23) designed to

bear against an engagement surface of the anti-drip means (12).
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that:

the filter holder (4) is provided with at least two fluid
outlets (11) which are disposed so as to allow coffee to flow

simultaneously into respective cups associated with each fluid outlet
(11); and
the anti-drip means (12) includes a closure valve (15) for
each of the fluid outlets (11).
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
tray (14) includes, at one end, a bulge (20) forming the first

control means, and at its other end, the engagement surface for the
second control means (20a), and also the closure valves (15). 
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the closure valves (15) are formed by plugs made of resiliently

deformable material.
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that the anti-drip means (12) is held in the return position by

return means (16) including a compression spring.
A machine according to claim 5, characterized in that the return
means (16) is interposed between the tray (14) and the filter holder

(4) vertically above the bulge (20).
A machine according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the filter holder (4) includes a distribution system for

distributing the flow of coffee via each of the fluid outlets (11),
said filter holder including positioning means (30) for positioning

the filter, and control means for controlling the flow of coffee
through the fluid outlets (11).
A machine according to claim 7, characterized in that the
positioning means (30) include a series of spaced-apart ribs which

extend radially from the inside wall (4a) and which stand on the
bottom (10) of the filter holder (4), said ribs (30) extending over

said bottom (10) so as to support the filter (7) and hold it at a
distance from said bottom (10).
A machine according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that each
fluid outlet (11) is formed in the thickness of the bottom (10) of

the filter holder and is surrounded by flow-control means constituted
by walls (35) provided with openings (36) and notches (37) opening

out on the top edge of the walls (35).
A machine according to claim 9, characterized in that the fluid
outlets (11) and the walls (35) are circular, and the openings (36)

are preferably two in number, are diametrically opposite, and extend
from the bottom (10) over the entire height of the walls.
