<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support for elastically securing elongated items, especially pipes, with an elastic holder (10) clamping the elongated item in a through aperture (11) which has a slot-like hole (13) running radially outwards from the aperture (11) capable of lapping over the elongated items, and with a securing system at least partly surrounding the holder (10) having at least two securing points for securing the holder (10) to a point of application (15; 29). The support consists of two separate securing components (17, 18) permanently fixed to the holder (10) having at least one of the securing points, in which the slot-like hole (13) is arranged between the two securing components (17, 18). The support thus consists virtually of only one integral part which is lapped over the pipe to be supported. This greatly facilitates assembly and storage.

<CLAIMS>
Holder for the flexible locating of elongated material, in 
particular pipes, with a flexible retaining part (10) which 

clamps the elongated material in a through hole (11), which has 
a slot-like opening (13) running radially outwards from the 

through hole (11) and allowing slipping-over the elongated 
material, and with a locating mount at least partially 

encompassing the retaining part (10) and which has at least two 
fastening points for fastening the retaining part (10) to an 

attachment point (15; 29), characterized in that the locating 
mount is comprised of two separate locating elements (17, 18; 25; 

32, 33) permanently fixed to the retaining part (10), each of 
which has at least one of the fastening points, wherein the slot-like 

opening (13) is situated between the two locating elements 
(17, 18; 25; 32, 33). 
Holder according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
locating elements (17, 18; 25; 32, 33) are arranged in ribbon-like 

form in the area of the outer circumference of the retaining 
part (10). 
Holder according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
fastening points are in the form of securing plates (21, 22; 26) 

angled in the plane of the attachment surface (16) of the 
retaining part (10) at the attachment point (15; 29). 
Holder according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
securing plates (21, 22; 26) are angled outwards, or inwards 

beneath the retaining part.  
 
Holder according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the locating elements (17, 18; 25; 32, 33) 

are bonded or moulded onto the outer circumference or engage at 
least partially in the retaining part (10) and are bonded or 

moulded on to it. 
Holder according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
locating elements (17, 18; 25; 32, 33) run within the retaining 

part (10) as far as the fastening points (21, 22), or that an 
area of the locating elements (17, 18) not running in the 

retaining part (10) is bonded or moulded to the outer 
circumference of the retaining part (10). 
Holder according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the retaining part (10) is essentially 

rectangular in form, and that the locating elements (17, 18; 25; 
32, 33) run along the two outer sides arranged at right-angles 

to the locating surface (14) of the retaining part (10) at the 
attachment point (15; 29; 30), and have angled end areas (19, 20) 

which run towards one another along the outer side of the 
retaining part (10) lying opposite the locating surface (14), 

with a space remaining between them. 
Holder according to claims 3 and 7, characterized in that 
retaining parts (10) provided with the locating elements (17, 18; 

25; 32, 33) are arranged above one another, wherein the angled 
securing plates (21, 22) on the locating element (17, 18; 25; 32, 

33) of the upper retaining part (10) are connected to the angled 
end areas (19, 20) of the lower retaining part (10) in each case.  

 
Holder according to claim 8, characterized in that the upper 
retaining part (31 and 35 respectively) in each case is smaller 

than the lower retaining part (10) and has outwards-angled 
securing plates (21, 22) or that the retaining parts (10) 

arranged on top of one another are essentially of the same size 
and have inwards-angled securing plates (26). 
Holder according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the slot-like opening (13) runs towards the 

locating surface (14) of the retaining part (10; 31; 35) at the 
attachment point (15; 29; 30). 
Holder according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the retaining parts (10; 31; 35) are in the 

form of dimensionally-stable blocks which are however expandable 
so as to slip over the elongated material. 
Holder according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that inwards-extending hose-like attachment 

elements (12) are moulded on to the through hole (11).
