<ABSTRACT>
The fermentation device for the biodegradation of organic material and for obtaining the biogas produced in the degradation has a closed container with an introduction orifice (2) for fresh material and inoculation material and discharge openings (4, 7) for the degradation products, as well as a stirring device (3) for mixing the fermentation material. The stirring device consists of stirring blades (18) which are moved in a circle and are preferably driven individually. Also provided are scrapers (12) with which substances (11) which have been deposited on the base of the container are intermittently conveyed to a discharge apparatus (7). A flow-through system (5, 6) for a heating medium is provided on the side walls and is divided where appropriate into a plurality of heating circuits in order to vary the temperature on different sectors of the heating surface.

Fermentation device for the biological decomposition of organic
material and for obtaining the biogas resulting from the decomposition with a

closed container with a feed opening for fresh products and circulating products
or inoculants and a discharge opening for the decomposition products and with a

stirring device for mixing the fermentation product, characterized in that the
stirring device (3) has agitator blades (18) driven circularly which are operated

individually.
Fermentation device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
agitator blade (18) consists of supports (19), cross struts (20) and blades (21),

which are attached to the spindles (14), which are arranged diagonally to the
vertical centre plane of the container.
Fermentation device according to one of claims 1 - 2,
characterized in that a flow system (5, 6) for a heating means is provided on the

side walls
Fermentation device according to claim 3, characterized in that the
flow system for the heating means Is divided into several heating circuits, in order

to vary the temperature in different sectors of the heating surface.
Fermentation device according to one of the previous claims,
Characterized in that scrapers (12) are arranged on the bottom of the container,

with which sediments (11) deposited on the bottom of the container are conveyed
in batches to the discharge device (7).
Fermentation device according to one of the previous claims,
characterized by a means of transport arranged lengthwise in the housing for

conveying fermentation products from the end area into the feed area.
