<CLAIMS>
An aqueous dispersion comprising 
>
 18% by weight of 
a melt-processable bipolymer composed of units of 

tetrafluoroethylene and a fluoroalkyl perfluorovinyl 
ether and having a number-average particle size of 

at most 50 nm. 
A dispersion as claimed in claim 1, comprising from 
19.5 to 25% by weight of the polymer. 
A dispersion as claimed in claim 1 or 2 having a 
number-average particle size of at most 40 nm. 
A dispersion as claimed in one or more of the 
preceding claims having a number-average particle 

size of below 30 nm. 
A dispersion as claimed in one or more of the 
preceding claims, wherein the bipolymer comprises 

units of a fluoroalkyl perfluorovinyl ether of the 
formula X-(CF
2
)
n
-O-CF=CF
2
, in which X is hydrogen, 
chlorine or fluorine and n is from 1 to 8. 
A dispersion as claimed in claim 5, wherein X is 
fluorine and n is from 1 to 3. 
A method of using a dispersion as claimed in one or 
more of the preceding claims for coating porous 

substrates.
