chamber (9), according to which method a mixture of 
components, which react and cure above a critical 

temperature, is put in liquid form in the chamber (9) 
through an inlet piece (1), which is provided with at 

least one filling duct (3,5) which opens into the chamber 
(9); whereby said mixture is allowed to react and cure by

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for forming an object of 
thermosetting synthetic material in a mould, having at 
least one chamber, according to which method a mixture of 
components, which react and cure above a critical 
temperature, is put in liquid form in the chamber by means of a 
casting nozzle through an inlet piece, which is provided with at 
least one filling duct which opens into the chamber,  
 
and which has a filling opening on which the 
casting nozzle fits liquid-tight during the 
injection of said mixture, 
whereby said 
mixture is allowed to react and cure by making sure that 
the temperature of the mould is higher than said 
temperature, after which the object with the inlet piece 
is removed from the mould. Such a method is known from patent EP-A-492 477. The 
inlet piece is a hollow shaft which is entirely situated 
inside the mould, and the mould is filled by means of a 
nozzle which is inserted in a duct which opens into the 
mould on said hollow shaft. The synthetic and the shape 
must be specially selected so as to avoid shrinking 
problems. Moreover, only an example is given with 
thermoplastic. It is mentioned, however, that also 
thermosetting synthetic can be used, but how one should 
proceed in this case is not described. How the above-mentioned 
nozzle, which must be cooled off to prevent it 
from being stopped up, can be cooled while it is inserted 
in a duct in the heated mould is not explained. 
According to the described method, especially when 
thermosetting synthetic is used, no great accuracy can be 
obtained for the objects made.  
 The invention aims to remedy the above-mentioned 
disadvantages and to provide a method for forming an 
object of thermosetting synthetic in a mould according to 
which also very precise mechanical parts can be made 
which require no further processing, for example a roll 
body with a very precise geometry provided with a shaft 
or another internal piece, which is preferably functional 
in the final product. To this aim 
an inlet piece is used which traverses a wall of 
the mould and which extends outside the mould, whereby 
the casting nozzle is maintained at a temperature 
which is lower than said critical temperature, 
and one makes sure that, at least during the filling of 
the mould, the inlet piece has a lower temperature than 
the above-mentioned critical temperature, such that the 
curing first takes place against the inner wall of the 
mould and finally against the inlet piece, and during the 
curing in the mould a pressure is
