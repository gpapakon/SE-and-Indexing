<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to pressure dispensing pumps which are capable of dispensing a predetermined amount of a fluent mass whether thus mass be liquid, semi-liquid, semi-solid or of a gel or paste like substance. The invention comprises a pressure dispensing pump (1) having a housing (2) adapted to be attached to a fluent container said housing including an inlet port (3) said dispensing pump including a valve means (4) for said inlet port and further comprising a pressure chamber portion (5) which integrally includes an outlet port with valve means (7) to close said outlet port. The invention also includes a pressure dispensing pump containing a pressure chamber portion (5) which comprises a collapsible wall portion (9) terminating in a substantially planar pressure surface (10). Further the pressure chamber can be of an asymmetrical configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A PRESSURE DISPENSING PUMP:This invention relates to pressure dispensing pumps and more particularly to those pressure dispensing pumps which are capable of dispensing a predetermined amount of a fluent mass whether that mass be liquid, semi liquid, semi solid or of a gel or paste like substance. PRIOR ARTThe prior art to these types of dispensers will now be described. U.S. Patent 3.361.305This patent relates to fluid dispensers and incorporates a series of one way valves and a ball outlet valve as well as a diaphragm pump arrangement. There is considerable multiplicity of parts requiring the assembly of an inlet valve into the inner wall then assembly of the ball into outlet valve at final assembly of the diaphragm onto container wall. Such devices as illustrated in 3,361 ,305 require considerable time in assembly and manufacture. The diaphragm is such that a predetermined amount of fluid cannot be dispensed accurately. Further, when placed in an "upside down" orientation, the valve arrangement is such that leakage of a low viscosity fluid would occur via outlet and ball.U.S. Patent 3.910.467This patent relates to a dispensing device for dispensing a fluid and utilises a diaphragm which is adapted to be pushed to permit the fluid to flow and a second diaphragm to serve as a sealing device. This patent relates not so much to a pump action type arrangement, but rather is a sophisticated valve arrangement to allow a metered dose to exit through an opening. Pressure is applied to the contents of the package by squeezing or exerting pressure upon the actual tube, which forces the funnel portion to move away from a valve or spindle element whilst simultaneously forcing the diaphragm down onto the top of spindle thereby sealing the aperture. In this way a selected amount of fluid will pass out of the aperture. The construction is such that it requires two diaphragms and spindle to be assembled in the container. The pump or pressure action comes from applying pressure to the outside of the container rather than to the dispensing head.DE 2842073This relates to a dispensing head for an atomiser and requires a multiplicity of parts including a pressure chamber arrangement, ball valve, variety of spring means and is designed to firstly action the pump and provide a fluid inside a chamber under pressure which is then released by the pushing of a spraying nozzle 

 which opens a further valve permitting the contents to be sprayed, presumably as a fine mist. This would not be suitable for more viscous fluids and

 THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1 . A pressure dispensing pump comprising a housing adapted to be attached to a fluent container said housing including an inlet port, said dispensing pump including a valve means for said inlet port and further comprising a pressure chamber portion which includes an outlet port with valve means to close said outlet port.
2. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in claim 1 , wherein said valve means for said inlet port is mounted on said housing.
3. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in claim 1 , wherein said valve means for said inlet port is integrally constructed with said pressure chamber portion.
4. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said outlet port is closed by means of a valve which opens when under pressure generated by said pressure chamber portion.
5. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said outlet port is formed by a slit in said pressure chamber portion and valve means is effected by the elastomeric nature of the pressure chamber portion.
6. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said outlet port prevents the ingress of atmosphere thereby protecting the contents of said fluid container from being contaminated.
7. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said pressure chamber portion comprises a collapsible wall portion terminating in a substantially planar pressure surface.
8. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in claim 7 above, wherein said wall portion and said planar pressure surface meet a side of said pressure chamber portion.
9. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said inlet valve is of a reed type construction. 


 10. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said valve means or said inlet port is of a washer or ball valve type construction.
11. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein a dispensing plate is used in conjunction with said bellows portion.
12. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in claim 11 , wherein a control means is adapted to co-operate with said dispensing plate to control the stroke of said bellows.
13. A pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein said fluid container is a collapsible bag.
14. A dispensing system comprising a pressure dispensing pump as claimed in any one of the preceding claims in combination with a fluent container being a flexible walled container.
15. A dispensing system as claimed in claim 14, wherein said fluent container is a collapsible bag or a bladder tuber or a rigid cylinder with a moveable base, or a rigid container with an air bleed.
16. A dispensing system as claimed in any one of claims 7 to 15 wherein a roller means engages said collapsible wall portion to activate said pump.
17. A dispensing system as claimed in claim 16 wherein said roller means rolls along said substantially planar pressure surface to activate said pump.
