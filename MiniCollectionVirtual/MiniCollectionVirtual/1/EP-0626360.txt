<ABSTRACT>
The lamellar interphase made of pyrolytic carbon is formed under reinforcing fibres inside a chamber in which a plurality of successive cycles are carried out, each including: the introduction of a gaseous reaction phase in which the precursor of the pyrolytic carbon is chosen from alkanes, with the exception of methane taken as a single constituent, alkenes, alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof, the maintaining of the gaseous phase in the chamber during a first time interval having a duration predetermined so as to form an interphase layer which has a controlled thickness of the order of a nanometre, then the removal of the gaseous reaction products during a second time interval, the cycles being carried out consecutively in the chamber until the desired thickness of the interphase is obtained, so as to produce a highly anisotropic lamellar interphase whose texture in network fringes has undulating fringes whose total length (L2) is on average equal to at least 4 nanometres, with maximum values exceeding 10 nanometres.

A method of manufacturing a composite material in which fiber 
reinforcement is densified by means of a matrix, the fibers being provided 

with a lamellar interphase coating of anisotropic pyrolytic carbon obtained 
by chemical vapor infiltration or deposition,
 
characterised in that the pyrolytic carbon lamellar interphase is formed on 

the fibers of the reinforcement inside a chamber in which a plurality of 
successive cycles is performed, each cycle comprising: injecting a reaction 

gaseous phase in which the pyrolytic carbon precursor is selected from 
alkanes, excluding methane taken as a sole component, alkenes, alkynes, 

and aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof; maintaining the gaseous 
phase inside the chamber for a first time period of predetermined time 

duration to form an interphase layer of controlled thickness of nanometer 
size; and evacuating the gaseous reaction products during a second time 

period; the cycles being performed consecutively in the chamber until the 
thickness desired for the interphase has been obtained, thereby achieving a 

lamellar interphase that is highly anisotropic, whose lattice fringe texture 
has distorted fringes of total length not less than 4 nanometers on average 

with maximum values exceeding 10 nanometers. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
thickness of each interphase layer is less than 10 nanometers. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that each interphase layer is deposited at a temperature lying in the range 

900°C to 1,000°C, at a pressure lying in the range 2 kPa to 5 kPa, with the 
gaseous phase being maintained inside the chamber for a time duration 

lying in the range 2 seconds to 30 seconds. 
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the pyrolytic 
carbon precursor is propane and the deposition temperature lies in the 

range 950°C to 1,000°C. 
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the pyrolytic 
carbon precursor is propylene and the deposition temperature lies in the 

range 900°C to 950°C. 
A composite material comprising a fiber reinforcement densified 
by a matrix and a lamellar interphase coating of anisotropic pyrolytic carbon 

formed between the fibers of the reinforcement and the matrix,
 
characterised in that the lamellar interphase is constituted by a highly 

anisotropic pyrolytic carbon whose 00.2 lattice fringe texture has distorted  
 

fringes of total length L
2
 that is on average not less than 4 nanometers with 
a maximum value that exceeds 10 nanometers, and in which the number N 

of elementary layers stacked coherently along the 
c
 crystallographic axis is 
on average not more than 4.
