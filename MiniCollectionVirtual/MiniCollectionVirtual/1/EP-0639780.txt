<ABSTRACT>
In order to enable surface tension forces to give an optical-fibre end (P1) a shape allowing good optical coupling, this end is partially melted in an electric arc (ZC). In order to improve the reproducibility of this shape, passage through the arc is achieved by a lateral unidirectional movement (MC) of the fibre. The invention applies in particular to the coupling of a ribbon of optical fibres to a linear array of components such as semiconductor lasers. In order to do this, the fibres (F1...F6) are fixed in grooves in a fibre holder (2). The latter is moved in order to immerse, simultaneously, the ends of the fibres in a chemical etching bath, which gives them a pointed shape, and then in order to pass them successively through the electric arc.
