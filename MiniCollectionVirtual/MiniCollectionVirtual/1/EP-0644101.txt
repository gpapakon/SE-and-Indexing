<ABSTRACT>
The hydraulic steering has a control valve which is closed in the neutral setting to reduce servo energy. The servo control valve has a sleeve (18) rotated by the output shaft (12) and with the output shaft linked to the input shaft (11) by a torsion rod. The sleeve can be rotated relative to the output shaft by a reaction sleeve (20) coupled to the input shaft to provide a servo control proportional to the input torque. The reaction sleeve is axially movable with the movement controlled by ball bearings (22) and shaped races (21). An inductive proximity sensor (24) monitors the movement of the reaction sleeve to operate a shut-off valve (7).

A steering valve having a closed centre for supplying 
an adjusting member with hydraulic pressure, comprising an 

input shaft (11), an output shaft (12), a torsion rod (17), 
which is connected at one end to the input shaft and at the 

other end to the output shaft, and a valve sleeve (18) 
enclosing the input shaft, characterised in that the valve 

sleeve (18) is connected to the output shaft (12) in such a 
manner that it can be rotated against a restoring force 

relative to the output shaft (12) about the common axis 
through an angular range in both directions from a basic 

position, and an adjusting member (20) is arranged on the 
steering valve (1) and exerts a torque upon the valve sleeve 

(18) acting in the same direction as the rotation of the 
input shaft (11), the torque being proportional to the 

pressure existing in the adjusting member. 
A steering valve according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the connection between the valve sleeve (18) and the 

output shaft (12) comprises a spring for generating the 
restoring force. 
A steering valve according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the spring is a C-spring (28). 
A steering valve according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the adjusting element is a 

reaction piston (20), which is arranged so as to be axially 
displaceable relative to the input shaft (11) and axially 

and rotationally displaceable relative to the valve sleeve 
(18), and exerts a torque upon the valve sleeve (18) when it 

approaches said valve sleeve. 
A steering valve according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the reaction piston (20) is connected to the valve  

 
sleeve (18) via an inclined rolling surface (21) and 

balls (22). 
A steering valve according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a cut-off valve is arranged in 

the hydraulic supply line. 
A steering valve according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the cut-off valve (7) is switched for the movement of 

the reaction piston (20) as a result of a signal from a 
proximity se
nsor (24) arranged on the steering valve (1). 
A steering valve according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the proximity sensor (24) is an inductive proximity 

sensor.
