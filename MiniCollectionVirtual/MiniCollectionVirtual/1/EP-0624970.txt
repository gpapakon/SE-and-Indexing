<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communications
apparatus for receiving standardized video image
and transmitting the same after conversion into a
facsimile signal.There are already proposed various still
image transmission apparatus for transmitting the
image reproduced from a still video camera, but there
has not been proposed an apparatus capable of mixedly
transmitting such image with the image of a facimile
original.Fig. 7 is a schematic view showing the
concept of image transmission by a still image transmission
apparatus.This still image transmission apparatus
converts an image reproduced from a disk of a still
video camera into compressed data according to a
predetermined method, and transmits said data to
the other still image transmission apparatus
according to a predetermined procedure. The other
apparatus expands the received image and stores it in
a disk of a still video camera.However the communication has only been 
possible between a same model of a same manufacturer,
because the procedure of transmission or method of
compression of image information are not unified and also
there are various output methods such as television
monitors and video printers.For this reason the still video image and the
facsimile image have had to be transmitted separately,
with complex operations.Such drawback exists not only in the still video but
for example also in the high definition television
system.In consideration of the foregoing, an object of the
present invention is to provide a communication apparatus
capable of resolving the drawbacks mentioned above.It is known from US-A-4614977 to provide
communication apparatus for transmitting image data to
a facsimile apparatus; comprising
input means operable to receive a standardized video
signal representative of an input image;conversion means operable to convert the video
signal to an output signal suitable for being received
and decoded by a facsimile apparatus;transmission means operable to transmit the output
signal.The present invention is characterised in that the
conversion means comprises;normalizing means operable to generate a normalized 
image signal representative of a normalized image of
larger size than the input image and having a
predetermined image size in conformity with a facsimile
standard size, wherein the normalized image signal
comprises a first component representative of the input
image and a second component representative of a
remaining part of the normalized image, the second
component being a single colour image signal;
