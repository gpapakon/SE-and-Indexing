<ABSTRACT>
An improved method for preparing electroconductive powders by applying a surface coating comprising amorphous silica, and an electro-conducting network of antimony-containing tin oxide crystallites. The process of the invention simultaneously deposits silica in association with an antimony-containing tin oxide. As a result, the process obviates the need for a separate silica deposition step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method for preparing
electroconductive powders (ECP) comprising a coating of antimony-containing tin
oxide.Electroconductive compositions and a process for preparing them are
described in European Patent Application Publication No. 0359569, which
published on March 21, 1990, and is entitled "IMPROVED ELECTROCONDUCTIVE
COMPOSITION AND PROCESS OF PREPARATION". The
process described in European Patent Publication No. 0359569 (hereinafter referred
to as "EPO '569"), for preparing ECP compositions requires providing a substrate
comprising an amorphous hydroxylated or active silica-containing material. The
hydroxyl groups on the substrate may enhance the chemical interaction among the
silica-containing solid, and an aqueous solution of tin and antimony salts in order to
form the desired ECP compositions. The substrate was prepared by coating a finely
divided core material with silica prepared in an active form by adding an aqueous
solution of an alkali silicate, such as sodium silicate or potassium silicate and a
mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid to an agitated suspension of
core material. The core material was optionally removed to produce a hollow silica
shell.A coating layer comprising hydrous oxides of tin and antimony was
then applied to the hydroxylated silica substrate surface by adding aqueous solutions
of hydrolyzable tin and antimony salts to a slurry of the substrate.In accordance with the present invention, a substrate can be coated to
obtain an electroconductive powder (ECP), in the absence of a hydroxylated silica
or active silica core. The process of the invention obviates the need for a separate
step to provide a hydroxylated silica surface, and therefore, achieves a significant
economic advantage in comparison to conventional ECP preparation methods. In
other words, the present invention can obtain an ECP by simultaneously depositing 
a portion of a substrate, e.g., a substrate which was conventionally employed to form
only a silica shell.The present invention can be accomplished by concurrently adding
solutions of an alkali silicate, antimony salt, and a tin salt into an agitated aqueous
suspension of the substrate particles while maintaining the pH in the range of about
1.0 to 4.0. The resultant ECPs typically range in size from sub-micron up to a few
microns, and possess an exterior coating or layer comprising silica or a silica-containing
material, and an electroconducting network of antimony-containing tin
oxide
