<ABSTRACT>
Processes for coating a ferrous or aluminum article, such as an engine cylinder liner insert (20), to provide a metallurgical bond with aluminum alloy material cast around the article. The article surface (26) to be bonded is treated to remove impurities, oxides, and foreign materials, and the article is preheated. A molten metallic bonding material, such as zinc or a zinc alloy, is provided and the treated and preheated article is immersed in the bonding material to provide a metallurgically bonded coating on the surface of the article being treated. The coated article, either shortly after coating or, alternatively, after having been cooled to ambient temperature and stored, can then be placed in a mold and molten aluminum alloy poured around it to metallurgically bond the aluminum to the coating on the article. The resulting structure provides a metallurgical bond that has improved heat transfer characteristics and improved structural integrity.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METALLURGICALLY BONDING INSERTS IN A CASTINGTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to processes for treating the surfaces of metallic inserts for incorporation into cast aluminum articles formed by casting molten aluminum (alloys) around said inserts. More particularly, the present invention relates to processes for surface treatment of engine cylinder liner inserts to permit the formation of a substantially continuous metallurgical bond between the external cylindrical surfaces of the liner inserts and the surrounding cast aluminum engine block. Proper application of this technology can provide a strong structural connection between the individual liner inserts and the cast block, and also can provide a liner-to-block interface that permits improved heat transfer between the liner inserts and the coolant for removal of combustion and friction heat when the engine is in operation. BACKGROUND ARTCast internal combustion engine blocks, such as those used to produce engines adapted to be installed in vehicles such as automobiles, have for a long time been formed from cast iron for the purposes of structural rigidity of the engine, and resistance to wear caused by the rapid sliding movement within a cylinder bore of a cylindrical piston having several piston rings with hardened wear surfaces. The use of cast iron as the block material, however, results in a very heavy engine which, because of its weight, increases fuel consumption. This runs counter to the modern trend of providing lighter weight automobiles for increased fuel economy.One way to increase the fuel economy of an automobile is to reduce the weight of the engine by making the engine block from an aluminum alloy, because aluminum has considerably lower density than cast iron. Although Aluminum Association registered alloys 390, A390, and B390 (hereinafter "390") have the required strength, are suitable 

 for casting and have the required resistance to wear to ensure long, trouble-free engine life, at times it might be desirable to provide an aluminum engine block having cylinder liner inserts. However, when cast iron or bare 390 alloy cylinder liner inserts have molten aluminum poured around them to form an aluminum alloy engine block, no metallurgical bond exists between the aluminum alloy casting and the cylinder liner inserts. Consequently, the connection between the cylinder liner inserts and the surrounding aluminum alloy block is merely a mechanical connection (defined by a distinct interfacial discontinuity) which limits the rate
