<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention, a method is disclosed for the 
remediation of scar tissue in a human or an animal by introducing into the scar tissue 

or into tissue adjacent the scar tissue a remedial composition comprising a bioactive 
material selected from naturally occurring growth factors, synthetic growth factors, 

active peptide segments of naturally occurring and synthetic growth factors, and mixtures 
thereof. Typically the remedial composition includes a biodegradable or non-biodegradable 

support matrix material to provide for timed release of the bioactive 
material. 
Preferably, the support matrix material is biodegradable and is selected from the 
group consisting of collagen, glycosaminoglycan, gelatin, albumin, hyaluronic acid, 

heparin, oxidized cellulose, dextran, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyanhydride 
and mixtures thereof. 
Most scar tissue, particularly in human beings, is very dense and is difficult for 
the remedial composition described above to penetrate. To render the scar tissue less 

dense and to spatially expand the scar tissue fibrils, it is preferable to introduce into the 
scar tissue a softening, expanding composition as well as the remedial composition 

containing the bioactive material. The softening, expanding composition can be 
introduced simultaneously with introduction of the remedial composition; however, it is 

preferable that the softening, expanding composition be introduced prior to the remedial 
composition. A preferred softening, expanding composition includes at least one dried 

collagen-comprising polymer, at least one polymer hydrogel and a non-aqueous liquid 
carrier material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a composition for altering scar tissue 
to render the tissue more elastic, expanded and softened. The invention is 
particularly effective in treating contour deformities, fibrous scars, adhesions, 
stress urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and localized muscular 
dysfunction, where normal tissue function is compromised by the presence 
of fibrotic connective tissue or scar tissue. The present invention relates to a composition useful in treatment of 
localized muscular dysfunction due to scarring following surgery, irradiation, 
laceration, burns or infections by introducing a controlled release, bioactive 
substance having tissue normalization activity into the scar tissue. Potential 
applications for this invention include, but are not limited to, treating contour 
deformities, surgical scars and adhesions, urinary incontinence, fecal 
incontinence, dermal scars, vocal cord injury, and esophageal injury. The term "injury" as used herein means a wound resulting from 
surgery, irradiation, burns, laceration, exposure to chemicals, viral infection 
or bacterial infection. The term "scar tissue" means fibrotic or collagenous 
tissue formed during the healing of a wound or other morbid process, or 
otherwise damaged tissue. The term "controlled release matrix" means any 
composition which will allow the slow release of a bioactive substance which 
is coupled to, mixed or admixed therein. The matrix can be a solid composition, 
a porous material, or a semi-solid, gel or liquid suspension containing 
the bioactive substance. The term "implant" means introduction of the  
 
bioactive material/matrix by means of injection, surgery, trochars, catheters or any other 
means whereby the bioactive material is introduced into the scar tissue. The term 
"bioactive material" means any composition that will promote the vascularization and 
normalization of tissue function. Examples of bioactive materials include any growth 
factor or cytokine that will alter the metabolism, biosynthetic process, or growth or 
function of connective tissue, muscle tissue, or nerve tissue. Scar tissue is fibrotic tissue composed mostly of disorganized collagen fibrils. 
It is tissue that is poorly vascularized, poorly innervated, and inelastic. When the 
normal cellular elements and extracellular matrix of damaged tissue are replaced by a 
distorted accumulation of scar tissue, the normal function of the tissue is lost. The 
formation of scar tissue can create localized muscular dysfunctions and
