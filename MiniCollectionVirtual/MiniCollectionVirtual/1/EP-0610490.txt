<ABSTRACT>
The electric fence is comprised of a flexible support (1, 2) made of a non electroconducting material, integrating an electroconductor network (3, 4). The network (3, 4) is comprised of a plurality of assemblies of conductor wires, at least two, each assembly extending periodically slant from a side edge (5) to the other edge (6) of said support in an undulated configuration throughout the length thereof, said assemblies being offset with respect to each other in the longitudinal direction so as to cross each other regularly at the middle of said support and being evenly distributed on either side of said support.

Electric fence consisting of a flexible support (1, 2) produced from an 
electrically non conducting material, incorporating an electrically conducting 

network (3, 4), characterized in that the said network (3, 4) consists of a plurality of 
sets of conductor wires, at least two, each set extending periodically slantwise from 

one lateral edge (5) to the other (6) of the said support in an undulating shape, over 
the whole length of the latter, the said sets being offset with respect to one another in 

the direction of the length in such a way as to cross over regularly in the middle of 
the said support, and are distributed in a substantially equalised way on either side of 

the said support. 
Electric fence according to Claim 1, characterized in that the sets (3, 4) 
of conductors are distributed symmetrically with respect to the median line of the 

support (1, 2). 
Electric fence according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
the support (1, 2) is a knitted product with looped stitches, and in that the electrical 

conductor wires (3, 4) are integrated into the support at production of the latter, the 
said electrical conductors being distributed by at least two guide bars of the knitting 

machine, allowing the support to be produced, the said bars working in the opposite 
direction to one another according to a weave pattern such that the electrical 

conductors (3, 4) are offset from one row of stitches to the following one over the 
whole width of the knitting. 
Electric fence according to Claim 3, characterized in that the support (1, 
2) is a knitted product with looped stitches which is produced by at least two guide 

bars, one of which works according to a chain weave pattern and the other according 
to a weave pattern transversely linking the said chains together. 
Electric fence according to one of Claims 3 or 4, characterized in that the 
sets of conductors (3, 4) are four in number, distributed in two pairs of two conductors, 

on either side of the said support so as to ensure equal conduction on both sides 
of the fence and, that being so, overcoming problems of random folding and 

unfolding which the fence undergoes.  
 
Electric fence according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
sets (3, 4) of conductors pass al
ternately above and below each intersection with the 
filaments (2) for linking the chains (1) of the said support, in such a way as to allow 

equal distribution of the electrical conductors on either side of the support. 
Electric fence according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the 
crossing points (7, 8) of the conductor wires between each other are completely free 

of any filament (2) for linking the chains (1) together.
