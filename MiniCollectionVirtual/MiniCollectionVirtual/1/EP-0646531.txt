<ABSTRACT>
1. Cigarette packs, namely especially hinge-lid packs and soft-cup packs, are designed so that the pack content, namely a cigarette group, is surrounded on all sides by an inner wrapping (11). This is to consist of paper, with a decorative print applied to the outside. Primarily for reasons of cost, the print is applied only to those surface regions of the inner wrapping (11) which are exposed when the pack (hinge-lid pack) is open or by virtue of construction. 2. The inner wrapping (11) is produced by being separated from a material web of paper which, depending on the design of the inner wrapping and depending on the folding construction, has print zones (34, 35) arranged at a distance from one another or a continuous strip-shaped print zone (43, 51) located at the edge.

Cigarette pack for a cigarette group which is 
surrounded on all sides by an inner wrapping (11) made of 

paper or similar material and thus forms a cigarette 
block (21), the cigarette block (21) being arranged in an 

outer pack part open on top, namely a box part (10) made 
of cardboard or a cup (45) made of paper, and the 

cigarette block (21) surrounded by the inner wrapping 
(11) projecting with an upper part region from the outer 

pack part open on top, characterized in that 
approximately only the outside surface regions of the 

inner wrapping (11) which project from the pack part open 
on top, namely the box part (10) or the cup, are provided 

with a print completely filling the surface regions, 
whilst the surface regions of the inner wrapping (11) 

which are seated in the pack part are concealed by the 
walls of the latter are free of prints. 
Cigarette pack according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that, in the case of a hinge-lid pack consisting 

of the box part (10), a lid (12) and a collar (13) 
arranged in the box part (10), a front wall (23) of the 

inner wrapping (11) is provided with a to directly below 
a perforation line (33) for limiting a pull-off flap (32) 

as part of the inner wrapping (11), the printed zone (34) 
being provided with a print which completely covers it. 
Cigarette pack according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that side tabs (25) adjoining the front wall 

(23) of the inner wrapping (11) are provided with a print 
which completely covers them and is of the same height as 

that of the front wall (23).  
 
Cigarette pack according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that a rear wall (24) of the inner 

wrapping (11) is provided with a printed zone (35), in 
that the printed zone (35), correspondingly to the 

smaller height of the lid (12), has a smaller height in 
the region of the rear wall (24) than the printed zone 

(34) in the region of the front wall (23), and in that 
the printed zone (35) is provided with a print which 

completely covers it. 
Cigarette pack according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that side tabs (26) adjoining the rear 

wall (24) of the inner wrapping (11) are provided with a 
print which completely covers them and is of the same 

height as that of the rear wall (24). 
Cigarette pack according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that, in the case of an inner wrapping 

(11) with a folded bottom wall, an upper region of the 
inner wrapping (11), the said upper region facing a 

folded end wall (27), is printed continuously in a strip-shaped 
manner, in such a way as to obtain a printed zone 

(43) which extends all-round, which, at least in the 
region of the front wall (23), is guided to directly 

below a perforation line (42) extending transversely 
relative to the front wall (23) and which is provided 

with a print which completely covers it. 
Cigarette pack according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that, in the case of a soft cup pack, 

the inner wrapping (11) projecting out of the cup (45) is 
provided with a printing zone (51) which is of the same 

height at the front wall (23), rear wall tabs (49, 50) 
and side walls (47, 48) and extends to directly below an 

upper cup edge (52), and which is continued in the region 
of folding tabs of the end wall (27), and in that the 

printed zone (51) is provided with a print which 
completely covers it. 
Material web made from paper or similar material 
for the production of blanks printed on their outside on 

one side for inner wrappings (11) of cigarette packs, the 
blanks being severable from the material web by means of  

 
transversely directed severing cuts, characterized in 

that, for the production of inner wrappings (11) with a 
closed wall (22) and an arrangement of the blanks (11) 

with their longitudinal extent transversely relative to 
the material web, strip-shaped printed zones, preferably 

of differing width, are arranged at a distance from one 
another in the longitudinal direction of the material 

web, the printed zones being provided with a print which 
completely fills them up, preferably along mutually 

opposite edge regions of the material web. 
Material web made from paper or similar material 
for the production of blanks printed outside on their on 

one side for inner wrappings (11) of cigarette packs, the 
blanks being severable from the material web by means of 

transversely directed severing cuts, characterized in 
that, for the production of blanks for inner wrappings 

(11) with a folded bottom and folded end wall (27), the 
material web has a conti
nuous strip-shaped printed zone 
(43, 51) on one edge region only, which printed zone is 

provided with a print which completely fills it up. 
Material web made from paper or similar material 
for the production of blanks, printed on their outsides 

on one side, of inner wrappings (11) of cigarette packs, 
the blanks being severable from the material web by means 

of transversely directed severing cuts, characterized in 
that, for the production of inner wrappings (11) with a 

closed bottom wall (22) and an arrangement of the blanks 
with their longitudinal extent in the direction of 

material web, there are arranged at a distance from one 
another printed surfaces, the size of which corresponds 

to the sum of printed zones (34, 35) of successive 
blanks, a severing line (36) for severing the blanks (11) 

from the material web according to the differing size of 
the printed zones (34, 35) being guided off-centre in the 

region of the printed surface, and the printed surfaces 
being provided with a print which completely fills them 

up.
