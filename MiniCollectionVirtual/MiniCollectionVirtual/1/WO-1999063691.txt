<ABSTRACT>
A transmitting apparatus for OFDMA signal transmission comprises serial/parallel converters for converting serial signals to parallel signals, a rearranging unit for rearranging the converted parallel signals at intervals of a power of two to do allocation of sub-carrier, an IFFT unit for performing reverse-Fourier transform of the number of data to time waveform according to the number of parallel signals, a parallel/serial converter for converting the converted parallel signals to serial signals, a D/A converter/orthogonal modulator for converting the converted serial signals to analog signals and further converting the analog signals to high-frequency signals, whereby the amount of calculation and power consumption are reduced.
