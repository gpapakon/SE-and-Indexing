<ABSTRACT>
An applicator for spraying tissue adhesive onto an affected portion comprises: a sterilized gas supply chamber; a sterilized 
gas supply pipe connected to the sterilized gas supply chamber; two sterilized gas injection nozzles for injecting the sterilized gas 

supplied to the sterilized gas supply chamber in the substantially same direction; two barrel connecting ports, to which forward 
end nozzles of the barrels are connected; and a spray head having two liquid pipes whose base end portions are connected to the 

barrel connecting ports and which pass through the sterilized gas supply chamber and project at the forward end portions thereof 
from the injection nozzles. In this applicator, coating solutions supplied from syringes of the two barrel connecting ports are injected 

from the forward end portions of the liquid pipes, the sterilized gases are injected from the two gas nozzles in the substantially 
same direction, and the two types of liquid injected from the liquid pipes are atomized and applied onto the affected portion 

in a mixed state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an applicator
for applying a biocompatible adhesive, containing
human or animal protein as a principal ingredient, to a
human or animal body according to the preamble of
claim 1. This applicator is preferably used for applying
the biocompatible adhesive for hemostasis of bleeding
onto a resected surface of liver or lung, or a surgically
sutured site of a digestive truct.A biocompatible adhesive mainly based on
human or animal protein is generally prepared in situ by
mixing a protein solution with another coagulating solution
containing a coagulation factor which promotes
coagulation of the protein. When applying to a surgical
site the biocompatible adhesive of this kind which, for
example, is a mixture of a solution containing both factor
XIII and fibrinogen with another solution containing
thrombin, one of two following methods are generally
used in the art: To apply the first mentioned solution to
the surgical site and then coating the same with the second
mentioned solution, and to premix the two solutions
together before the resultant mixture is applied to the
surgical site by the use of a syringe.These methods suffer from several drawbacks.
For example, in the first mentioned method, surface
hardening takes place before the two solutions are completely
mixed together, which resulting in insufficient
mixing and reduction of the adhesive strength. In the
second mentioned method, since the hardening of the
adhesive starts soon after mixing the two solutions, it is
necessary to apply the adhesive to the surgical site
immediately after the mixing. For this reason, this second
mentioned method does not only require considerable
surgical skill, but also limits its application.To solve these problems, a method for accommodating
those two solutions in syringes separately,
ejecting the solutions simultaneously from the respective
syringes so as to mix together and apply the resultant
mixture to the surgical site, has been suggested in
the Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publications No. 64-25843
and No. 64-4040, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open
Publication No. 62-62674, 62-62675, No. 62-65972,
No. 62-65973, No. 62-20853, No. 1-82049, and
Japanese Utility Model Publication No.3-47609.The applicator for applying the biocompatible
adhesive described in the Japanese Utility Model Publication
No. 3-47609 includes a conflux head having
defined therein a pair of conveying channels for conveying
two solutions, respectively, which are discharged
from associated conical portions, or nozzles
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An applicator for applying a biocompatible adhesive containing human
or animal protein as a principal ingredient to a surgical site of living body,

comprising:

a spray head (20) for spraying two solutions, that is, a protein solution and a
coagulation solution, fed from two syringe barrels, respectively, by an ejection of a

sterile gas, said spray head including;
a housing (21) having a pair of adjacent sterile-gas ejecting nozzles (22),
longitudinal axes thereof being oriented in a predetermined 
same

direction for guiding and ejecting the sterile gas in that direction;
a pair of adapters (26) for receiving respective nozzles (5) of syringe barrels
(3);
and a sterile-gas supply tube (28) connected to the interior of the housing (21) for
supplying the sterile gas; 
characterized by
a pair of solution tubes (27), each arranged and associated within each
sterile-gas ejecting nozzle (22) each having a longitudinal axes parallel to the

longitudinal axes of the gas ejecting nozzle, each of which has one end thereof
connected to the adapter (26) and the other end thereof protrudes a predetermined

distance outwardly from the respective sterile-gas ejecting nozzle (22) through an
interior of the housing (21), so that the solutions fed from the syringe barrels (3) are

conveyed through the solution tubes (27) and ejected therefrom, respectively.
An applicator for applying a biocompatible adhesive
