<ABSTRACT>
What is proposed is a fitting for tiltable, parallel-sidetrackable and displaceable wings (100), in which a setting-out arm (10) is arranged pivotably on the running carriage (101). The setting-out arm (10) is itself connected pivotably to a control arm (6), on the other end of which is provided a guide pin (2) engaging into a control slot (4, 4a, 4b) which is itself arranged in a plate (4) also fastened to the running carriage (101). So that the said running carriage (101) becomes narrower in order to give the fitting as a whole a smaller constructional depth, it is proposed to make the guide plate (5) narrower, this being achieved by means of a non-circular guide pin (2) which is not rotationally symmetrical, but purely axially symmetrical. It can have two flat sides (2a, 2b) and on the remaining sides (2c, 2d) can have a slightly convex outer curvature. The guide slot (4) is elongate and, at one end (4a), has a transfer slope (1) which is arranged opposite a fixing recess (3), in order to guide the pin (2) into the desired direction (21), despite its flattening, when the setting-out arm (10) and control arm (6) are pivoted outwards.

A fitting for a tiltable, moveable panel (100) which can be immobilised 
in parallel position, 
characterised in that
(a) a guide plate (5) disposed on a carriage (101) has a guide slot (4) in 
which a rotationally asymmetrical, especially axially asymmetrical, non-round 

guide pin (2) is slidably held, and 
(b) the guide slot (4) is elongate and at one end (4a) has a transitional slope 
(1) disposed opposite a fixing recess (3). 
A fitting according to claim 1, 
wherein
 the guide pin (2) is flat on two 
sides (2a, 2b) and has a slightly convex external curvature on the remaining 

sides (2c, 2d). 
A fitting according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 the fixing recess (3) is 
dimensioned so that 


(a) the convex curved parts of the guide pin (2) can be fixed between the 
front end (4a) of the guide slot (4) and a nose or projection (3a) disposed 

opposite the transitional slope (1) and 
(b) in its transverse direction (2q) from one flat side (2a) to the opposite flat 
side (2b) the guide pin (2) can be received by the fixing recess (3), 

that is when the fitting is in the position where the panel is moved and 
immobilised in parallel position. 
A fitting according to claim 2 or 3, 
wherein
 the distance between the flat 
sides (2a, 2b) of the guide pin (2) and the mutual alignment and spacing of the  

 
transitional slope (1) and the projection (3a) are adjusted to one another so that 

the centre plane (21) half way between the flat sides (2a, 2b) of the guide pin 
(2) has already passed the projection (3a) when the guide pin (2) leaves the 

transitional slope (1) in the direction towards the fixing recess (3). 
A fitting according to any of claims 2 to 4, 
wherein
 the guide slot (4; 4a, 
4b) at the rear end (4b) has a width approximately equal to the distance 

between the flat sides (2a, 2b) of the guide pin (2) (that is the transverse axis 
2q of the pin) and widens in the direction towards the front end (4a) towards 

the transitional slope (1). 
A fitting according to any of the preceding claims 
wherein
(a) a pressure spring (8) is disposed on an extension arm (10) pivotably 
connected to the carriage (101), and 
(b) a rear abutment (9) is provided on a control arm (6) bearing the guide pin 
(2; 2a, 2b) and the pressure spring (8) resiliently abuts it (only) when the guide 

pin (2) reaches and remains in the fixing recess (3) (parallel immobilisation - 
open position - of the panel). 
A fitting according to claim 6, 
wherein
 the spring (8) is interchangeably 
held in the extension arm (10).
