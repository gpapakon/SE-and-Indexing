<ABSTRACT>
A planar fuse panel (10) is presented. A multiplicity of circuits may be included in the planar fuse panel depending on the number of circuits desired. The circuits may have any suitable planar shape. In a preferred embodiment, each circuit has an overall rectangular shape with a first portion consisting of an "L" shaped element (13) and a second portion comprising a rectangular shaped element (15) located in the shoulder of the first element. Spaces (17) are formed bridging the two portions of each circuit with bent tabs (22, 24) extending into each space to frictionally engage a blade-type terminal from a fuse or the like. The conductive metal is appropriately finished and/or plated and then insulative layers (30, 32), such as polyester or polyimide film, are applied (e.g., laminated) to both surfaces of the metal in sheet form.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PLANER FUSE PANELBackground of the Invention;The present invention relates generally to fuse holders for replaceable electrical circuit elements such as fuses and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to a novel one piece planar fuse holder that may be directly retained by the connecting power distribution circuitry which eliminates the need for separable discrete fuse holders in the circuitry. This invention is particularly well suited for use in motor vehicle applications.There are several prior art fuse holders that incorporate stamping and forming methods to mass produce contact terminals. This prior art is exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 4,616,416 to Cabraud and U.S. Patent No. 4,712,299 to Loewen et al. However, both of these patents apply only to the metal terminal elements of fuse holders or other electrical connectors,Prior art U.S. Patent No. 4,872,262 to David R. March does address the need for a fuse holder for replaceable circuit elements having blade-type 

terminals. Such fuses are well known in the industry and comprise a pair of spaced blades partially enclosed in an insulative housing. The blades are interconnected within the housing by a conductive interconnect which self-destructs at a preselected amperage. The blades extend from the housing for frictional connection to a suitable, typically plastic housing. Examples of such fuses include "ATC" fuses manufactured by Cooper Industries, Inc. of Houston Texas and "ATO" fuses manufactured by Littelfuse. Blade-type fuses have found widespread use in electrical systems found in automobiles, motorboats and many other products.The disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 4,872,262 does show improvements and economies over prior art.However, U.S. Patent No. 4,872,262 still suffers from certain drawbacks such as requiring a multiplicity of parts as well as requiring separate fuse holder blocks for separate circuits. In addition, the design disclosed in Patent No. 4,872,262 requires considerable guidance for fuse insertion because of the configuration of the contact tabs. The fuse holder of Patent 4,872,262 also requires expensive injection molding components. Other patents of interest in this area, which pose similar or other problems, include U.S. Patent Nos. 2,116,269, 3,140,364; 3,457,640; 3,618,207; 4,197,636; 4,337,574; 4,801,278; 4,938,715 and 5,113,168.Summary of the Invention: The above-discussed and other drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by the planer fuse panel of the present invention.

 CLAIMS :
CLAIM 1. A fuse retainer comprising: planar resilient metal sheet means having a plurality of discrete, spaced planar circuits formed therein, each circuit comprising a first element having a first shape and a second element having a second shape, said first element being spaced from said second element by an insulative gap; a space formed through each of said circuits and bridging said first element, said second element and said gap; first bent resilient tab means extending from said first element and into said space; second resilient bent tab means extending from said second element into said space, said first and second bent tab means cooperating to frictionally engage and retain a blade from a fuse or the like; first electrical connector means extending from said first element outwardly of said planar sheet; second electrical connector means extending from said second element outwardly of said planar sheet; and a dielectric protective layer surrounding said planar sheet means with the exception of at least said (1) space, (2) at least a portion of said first and second bent tab means and (3) said first and second electrical connector means.
CLAIM 2. The fuse retainer of claim 1 wherein: said circuit has a rectangular shape with said first element having an 
M
L" shaped configuration and said second element having a rectangular configuration and being located in the shoulder of the "L" shaped first element. 


CLAIM 3. The fuse retainer of claim 2 wherein: said insulative gap is "L" shaped.
CLAIM 4. The fuse retainer of claim 1 wherein: said first and second resilient bent tab means each comprise three tabs with the first two tabs being coplanar and the third tabs being disposed across from, and offset from, said first two tabs.
CLAIM 5. The fuse retainer of claim 1 wherein: said first and second resilient bent tab means each comprise two tabs which are across from and offset from, each other.
CLAIM 6. The fuse retainer of claim 1 wherein: said planar sheet means comprises a single sheet of metal.
CLAIM 7. The fuse retainer of claim 1 wherein: said planar sheet means comprises a first and a second sheet of metal.
CLAIM 8. The fuse retainer of claim 7 wherein: said first and second resilient bent tab means comprise at least one first tab extending from said first metal sheet and at least one second tab extending from said second metal sheet, said first and second tabs being disposed across from one another. 


CLAIM 9. The fuse retainer of claim 8 wherein: said first metal sheet is thicker than said second metal sheet.
CLAIM 10. The fuse retainer of claim 8 wherein: said first and second tabs are normally in contact with each other.
CLAIM 11. The fuse retainer of claim 1 wherein: said planar sheet means has a substantially rectangular configuration; and said first and second electrical connector means comprise aligned spade-like terminal extending from opposed longitudinal sides of said planar sheet means.
CLAIM 12. The fuse retainer of claim 1 wherein: said dielectric protective layer comprises insulative polymeric films laminated to opposed planar surfaces of said sheet means.
