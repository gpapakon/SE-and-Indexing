"PROCESS FOR   UHE      PREPARATION    O? RUBBER COMPOSITIONS
 HAVING A   THIGH    MODULUS OF   SPASTICITY   
 This invention relates to a process for preparing a rubber composition having a high modulus of elasticity by drawing, at a temperature within a specific range, a mixture consisting essentially of a rubber matrix containing a microdispersion of particles of a high melting point isotactic polymer of an   z-ethylenically    unsaturated hydrocarbon.


 Conservation of material resources and of energy have   became    important themes in the industrial world in recent years, as a result of which attention in the rubber industry has been directed to making the weight of articles lighter and enhancing performances of articles. For this purpose, in some specific fields, there have been desired vulcanized rubbers with a higher modulus of elasticity than that of generally used vulcanized rubbers but in which the physical  properties of the vulcanized rubbers (other than the modulus of elasticity) are substantially the same as those of conventional vulcanized rubbers; moreover, it is desired that the rubber composition should have excellent processability in preparing rubber articles.


 A common method of increasing the modulus of elasticity of a vulcanized rubber is to mix a rubber with a material having a high modulus of elasticity (such as carbon black or a resin) in a powdery or fibrous form. However, the dispersibility of the highmodulus material in the rubber and the interfacial adhesion of the rubber and the high-modulus material are both unsatisfactory, and therefore, when stress is exerted on the vulcanized rubber, the interface of the rubber and the high-modulus material breaks down, resulting in a deterioration in the physical properties (such as tensile strength, tear resistance and flexing resistance) of the vulcanizate.
For example, even polyisoprene rubber, which has the highest flexing resistance of all diene-type rubbers and is widely used for radial tires, has the problem that, when a large amount of carbon black is incorporated therein to increase the modulus of elasticity, the physical properties, particularly flexing resistance, of vulcanisates thereof decrease.


 A composition in which short fibers of a highly crystalline 1,2-polybutadiene are micro-dispersed in  rubber is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application
