<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of circuit blocks that output 
digital signals with different sampling frequencies are 

connected to data buses in common. One of outputs of 
the circuit blocks is selected and the output is sent 

to a sampling rate converter circuit block through the 
data buses. Each of the circuit blocks has a tri-state 

buffer at its output stage. With an output enable 
signal, a desired circuit block can be selected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sampling 
rate converting system for converting a sampling rate 
of a video signal. When a video signal is digitized and 
processed, a sampling frequency suitable for the TV 
system of the video signal should be used. For 
example, the NTSC system uses a sampling frequency of 4 
fsc (= 14.31818 MHz). The PAL system uses a sampling 
frequency of 4 fsc (= 17.734475 MHz). The D2-MAC 
system usually uses a sampling frequency of 13.5 MHz. 
A down-converter of the MUSE-NTSC system uses a 
sampling frequency of 910 fH (= 14.3325 MHz). Thus, when a video signal processing system 
that can deal with video signals of various TV systems 
such as a world-wide type TV receiver, a large number 
of clock frequencies should be used. Thus, such a video signal processing system 
converts a digital video signal into an analog video 
signal and then processes the analog video signal. 
Alternatively, the system converts a digital video 
signal into an analog video signal and then process the 
analog signal with a common sampling clock changed from 
the original sampling clock. However, when an analog signal that has been 
converted from a digital signal is processed, many D/A  
 
converters and low-pass filters are required, thereby 
increasing the circuit scale. In addition, when a 
signal passes through many D/A converters and A/D 
converters, it tends to be deteriorated. Therefore, an object of the present invention 
is to provide a sampling rate converting system that 
can convert different sampling frequencies of signals 
of a plurality of circuits into a common sampling 
frequency without an increase of circuit scale. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a sampling rate converting system that can be 
easily extended. The present invention is a sampling rate 
converting system, comprising a plurality of circuit 
blocks for outputting digital signals with different 
sampling frequencies, a data bus for commonly 
connecting output ends of the circuit blocks, and a 
sampling rate converter having an input end connected 
to the data bus and being adapted for converting a 
sampling frequency of a digital signal received through 
the data bus into a predetermined sampling frequency, 
wherein the system is adapted for selecting one of 
outputs of the circuit blocks, sending the selected 
output to the sampling rate converter through the data 
bus, and converting a sampling frequency of the  
 
selected output into the predetermined sampling 
frequency. Each of the circuit
