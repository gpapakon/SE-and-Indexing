<ABSTRACT>
A switching device which can be used in at least one mains conductor of a medium-voltage or high-voltage power supply network interrupts the at least one mains conductor if a specific overcurrent occurs. In order to simplify and reduce the price of the switching device, a non-linear resistor having a positive temperature coefficient is connected in series with an electrical load interrupter switch, which resistor limits the overcurrent which occurs to current levels which can be switched by the load interrupter switch. A short-circuit current can be switched by assigning a load interrupter switch to a non-linear resistor.
