<ABSTRACT>
It is known to cover deep-freezing chests for storing and displaying frozen food in self-service shops with covering plates at night or on Sundays and holidays, in order to avoid unnecessary losses of cooling temperature. For better handling of the removable covering plates, it is proposed that the covering plate (2) be connected in the vicinity of its free lateral outer edge to a traction rope (6), that the traction rope be capable of being wound up on a rotatable rod (5) arranged horizontally above the covering plate, and that the covering plate be held at the two ends of the plate edge (10) remote from the traction-rope fastening in a manner guided in a vertical rail (13).
