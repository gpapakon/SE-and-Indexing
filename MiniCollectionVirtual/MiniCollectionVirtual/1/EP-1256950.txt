<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording apparatus
for recording data, a reproduction apparatus for
reproducing data, a data processing apparatus for moving
or copying data that is recorded in a recording medium into
another apparatus, a recording and reproduction apparatus
for recording and reproducing data that is moved in such
a manner, a data transmission apparatus for transmitting
a stream formed of a plurality of pieces of data and a
recording apparatus as well as a recording and reproduction
apparatus for reproducing, with a time shift, the contents
that are broadcast via TV broadcasting, or the like, so
as to be viewed after being delayed a predetermined period
of time.It is necessary to protect a copyright in the case
of dealing with data, for which copyright protection is
necessary, such as a new movie, a TV program or music of 
a fee charging broadcast. As an effective method of
protecting a copyright, there is the method of limiting
the utilization of data by encrypting the data of which
the copyright requires protection.For example, at the time of the transmission of audio
and visual data (hereinafter denoted as AV data), in the
case that copyright protection is necessary for the AV data,
the AV data is encrypted before being transmitted. As an
example of the above, IEEE1394-DTCP (digital transmission
protection) system has become a standard.IEEE1394 allows data to be synchronously transmitted
by means of a fast bus system that carries out a serial
transmission and, therefore, it is possible to transmit
AV data, or the like, in real time. This IEEE1394 system
is being installed in a variety of digital audio and visual
equipment, including household digital AV equipment as an
external interface.According to the IEEE1394-DTCP system, a
certification function and the function of the
nullification of a key are provided at the time of data
transmission via an IEEE1394 bus so that the copyright
protection can be realized by encrypting data for which
copyright protection is necessary, such as AV data before
being transmitted.Now, together with the spread and development of 
personal computers, a large number of recording apparatuses
or reproduction apparatuses, such as a hard disk apparatus,
have come into use, due to their large storage capacity
and due to their high speed of access, as external memory
apparatuses. Furthermore, hard disk apparatuses have
recently come into use not only in computers but also in
digital AV equipment, or the like, where video and sound
are recorded and

listening is impossible is implemented by encrypting the

data of said copy restricted content after reproduction.
A recording apparatus according to any of Claims 76
to 80, characterized in that the timing according to which

said recording means starts the recording of said copy
restricted content is defined by referring to judgment

information in conjunction with said copy restricted
content.
A recording apparatus according to Claim 81,characterized in that said recording means carries out
recording by differentiating said copy restricted content

from other content by using said judgment information.
A recording apparatus according to Claim 81,characterized in that said judgment information is
copyright information included in a data column of said

copy restricted content.

to 80, characterized in that said recording medium has a

recording buffer for temporarily recording said copy
restricted content.
A recording apparatus according to Claim 85,characterized in that said recording buffer is a ring buffer
wherein it is possible to record a constant amount of data

by repeating overwriting recording in the same region.
A recording and reproduction apparatus characterized
by comprising:


a recording apparatus according to any of Claims 76
to 85; and
a reproduction means of reproducing data recorded in
said recording medium,

   wherein said reproduction means reproduces said copy
restricted content that has been recorded after a

predetermined period of standby time has elapsed since the
time of the start of the recording of said copy restricted

content.
A recording and reproduction apparatus characterized
by comprising:


a recording apparatus according to Claim 86; and
a reproduction means of reproducing data recorded in
said recording medium,

   wherein said reproduction means reproduces said copy
restricted content that has been recorded after a

predetermined period of standby time has elapsed since the
time of the start of the recording of said copy restricted

content.
A recording and reproduction apparatus according to
Claim 88, characterized in that, at the time when said

reproduction means carries out a reproduction operation
under the condition wherein overwriting recording is being

carried out in said ring buffer, the reproduction of said
data is carried out starting from the position where the

oldest piece of data is recorded in said ring buffer.
A recording and reproduction apparatus according to
Claim 89, characterized in that, at the time when said

reproduction means carries out a reproduction operation
under the condition wherein overwriting recording is not

carried out in said ring buffer, the reproduction of said
data is carried out starting from the recording start

position on said ring buffer.
A recording and reproduction apparatus according to
Claim 87 or 88, characterized in that, in the case that

copy restricted content recorded in said recording medium
is not reproduced within said predetermined period of

standby time, said recording apparatus stops the recording
operation of said copy restricted content.
