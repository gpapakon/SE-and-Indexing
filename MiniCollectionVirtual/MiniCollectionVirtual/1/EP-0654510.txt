<ABSTRACT>
Composite films which exhibit low oxygen 
transmission rates comprise a silane resin coated on a 

plastic substrate which is then cured by ultraviolet 
radiation. For the silane coating, this invention relies on 

a class of organosilicon compounds derived from 1) 
organohydrogensilanes or organohydrogensiloxanes and 2) 

propargyl esters of carboxylic acids containing a terminal 
aromatic hydrocarbon radical, where the carbopropynoxy group 

of the ester and the aromatic hydrocarbon radical are 
separated by at least two adjacent ethylenically unsaturated 

carbon atoms. If more than two of these carbon atoms are 
present, they form a sequence of conjugated ethylenic double 

bonds which allows the polymer to cross-link upon exposure 
to ultraviolet radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to composite films 
generally and composite films for applications requiring low 
oxygen transmission rates in particular. Packages allowing significant penetration of 
oxygen or other gases are undesirable where gas transmission 
contributes to the decay of the packaged product. For 
example, the development of packages having low oxygen 
transmission rates, i.e., high oxygen barrier properties, 
has long been a desirable objective because low gas 
permeability food packages increase the shelf life of 
packaged food products. Packages with low oxygen 
transmission rates also have utility for packaging other 
oxygen sensitive materials, such as oxygen activated 
sealants. Longer shelf life increases inventory efficiency 
for distributors and reduces the likelihood that the 
consumer will accidently purchase a contaminated product. 
For a plastic film to qualify for food packaging 
applications, the film has to have low oxygen permeability 
at low relative humidity and also at high relative humidity 
since the packed food may be stored in either environment. 
Unfortunately, most commercially available plastic films 
cannot meet these two requirements simultaneously. The 
ideal film will have both low oxygen permeability and will 
also be insensitive to relative humidity. Our invention 
solves these problems by introducing a silicone treated 
plastic film which exhibits excellent low gas transmission 
characteristics both at 0% relative humidity and at 85% 
relative humidity. The related prior art is represented by US-A(s) 
5,077,135 and 5,096,738 which disclose methods of imbuing  
 
polymer films with gas impermeable surface characteristics 
using silane compounds and cross-linkers to produce gas and 
related barrier characteristics. The present invention teaches the preparation of 
composite films which exhibit low oxygen transmission rates. 
These films comprise a silane resin coated on a plastic 
substrate and then cured by ultraviolet radiation. For the silane coating, our invention relies on a 
class of organosilicon compounds derived from 1) 
organohydrogensilanes or organohydrogensiloxanes and 2) 
propargyl esters of carboxylic acids containing a terminal 
aromatic hydrocarbon radical, characterized by the 
carbopropynoxy group of the ester and the aromatic 
hydrocarbon radical being separated by at least two adjacent 
ethylenically unsaturated carbon atoms. If more than two of 
these carbon atoms are present, they form a sequence of 
conjugated ethylenic double bonds which
