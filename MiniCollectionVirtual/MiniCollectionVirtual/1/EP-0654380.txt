Roof rail for vehicles having a strut (1, 10) 
which can be supported at each end on the associated 

vehicle roof via a supporting foot (2, 20), characterized 
in that the supporting foot (2, 20) consists of a tubular 

extruded profile and is shaped in such a manner that it 
has a downwardly sloping bow part (3, 30) and a freely 

emerging, essentially planar supporting surface (4, 40) 
which adjoins said bow part, runs spaced apart in terms 

of height but essentially parallel to the strut (1, 10) 
and furthermore is shaped in such a manner that a flattened 

wall region (5, 50) of the extruded profile is 
supported from above against the supporting surface (4, 

40), the supporting surface (4, 40) and the wall region 
(5, 50) supported thereon being penetrated by a hole (6, 

60) for guiding through a fastening element (7, 70), and 
a covering cap (8, 80) being arranged on the supporting 

foot (2, 20). 
Roof rail according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each end region of the strut (1) is shaped to form 

a supporting foot (2) and hence the strut (1) and the 
supporting feet (2) are designed as an integral 

constructional unit. 
Roof rail according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a stepped shoulder (100) is constructed in each case 

in the transition region from the strut (1) to the bow 
part (3), which shoulder makes possible an offset-free 

transition between the strut (1) and that free end of 
each covering cap (8) which is supported on the shoulder 

(100).  
 
Roof rail according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the covering caps (8, 80) can 

be secured on the supporting feet (2, 20) by means of 
moulded-on clip elements (11, 81). 
Roof rail according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that each supporting foot (2, 20) 

has at least one wall passage (12, 82) and undercuts (13, 
83) for the snapping-in and rear latching of the clip 

elements (11, 81) moulded onto the covering caps (8, 80). 
Roof rail according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the covering caps (8, 80) are 

articulated pivotably on the supporting feet (2, 20), in 
each case via a pivot pin (86), in such a manner that 

when pivoted upwards they allow access to the fastening 
elements (7, 70). 
Roof rail according to at least one of Claims 1 
or 4 to 6, characterized in that each supporting foot (2, 

20) is constructed with a continuous rib (21) which 
protrudes downwards and has clearances remaining next to 

it on the left and right, and in each case has a plug-in 
pin (22) which fits into the ends of the strut, and in 

that slot openings for receiving the rib (21) situated on 
each supporting foot are provided in the end regions of 

the strut (1, 10). 
Roof rail according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that the covering cap (8, 80) has 

a U-shaped cross section with a web (87) covering the top 
side of the supporting foot (2, 20) and two limbs (88) 

covering the supporting foot (2, 20) on both sides, and 
in that onto the free edge regions of the limbs (88) 

there are moulded inwardly directed material projections 
(85) which can be snapped into the clearances in the 

supporting foot. 
Roof rail according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that on the web underside of the 

covering cap (8, 80) there are moulded on the one hand 
the clip elements (11, 81) and on the other hand a 

bearing block (89) having an elongated hole (90) for the 
pivot pin (86).
