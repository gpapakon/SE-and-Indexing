<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plastic screw cap comprising a capping (stopping) part (3); possible sealing means (7) which are attached to or integral with the capping part (3); and, in a single piece with the capping part (3), a tamper evidence band (8). According to the invention, the cap comprises a zone (17) which can be broken off from the outer part (9), permitting its opening during unscrewing of the cap (1), ends, on the one hand, in an empty space (18) between the outer part (9) and the skirt (5), which empty space (18) terminates in the downstream direction with respect to the direction of unscrewing of the cap (1) in at least one attachment (19) which cannot be broken during unscrewing of the cap (1) belonging to the said linking means (11), and, on the other hand, in either a breakable zone (20a) or a cut (20b) or an interruption of continuity (20c) of the inner part (10) so that, when the cap (1) is unscrewed, the tamper evidence strip (8) remains attached to the capping part (3).
