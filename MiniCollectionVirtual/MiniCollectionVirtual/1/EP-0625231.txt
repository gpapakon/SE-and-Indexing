<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a joint device comprising two sheet-like
building elements made for insulating purposes, wherein element portions
of both elements extending along the joint border are designed to
be brought into engagement with each other and to create a connection
between said two elements at the joint by means of a male member comprising
a rib extending along the longitudinal direction of the joint and a
female member comprising a groove extending along the longitudinal direction
of the joint, the convergence of the male member substantially
corresponding to the divergence of the female member, wherein the male
member is adapted to be freely introducable into the female member until
it reaches an introduced position in which substantially the entire surfaces
of the lateral wall portions thereof introduced into the female member
bear against wall portions of the female member, the dimensions of
the male and female members being so chosen with respect to each
other that the end surfaces of the rib are located at a certain distance
from the bottom of the groove in said introduced position.Such building elements may be used for insulating a building or parts
thereof against for instance moisture or radon and so as to reduce the
heat exchange between the interior of the building and the surroundings.
The present invention generally relates to all conceivable uses of building
elements for insulating purposes and in particular those for protecting the
foundation of a building against moisture and radon gas from the surrounding
ground, for which reason the latter case will be discussed
hereinafter in exemplifying but not limiting way. When insulating the foundation of buildings it was conventional practice
to lay insulating sheets loose close to each other in several layers before
the foundation plate of the building was casted or moulded thereupon or
close to each other in the mould for moulding basement walls or under
the floor structure or on the basement wall of buildings already existing.
The disadvantage of these procedures is that a joint between the adjacent
building elements does not become completely tight, but the elements
will slide slightly apart at at least some locations. It is even sufficient
with very small gaps, which may appear when elements are actually
bearing against each other as a consequence of small irregularities in
their bearing surfaces, for letting moisture and radon gas find a way
through the insulation and reach the interior of the building with a risk of
moistu

<CLAIMS>
A joint device comprising two sheet-like building elements (1, 1') made
for insulating purposes, wherein element portions (2) of both elements

extending along the joint border are designed to be brought into engagement
with each other and to create a connection between said two

elements at the joint by means of male member comprising a rib (4) extending
along the longitudinal direction of the joint and a female member

comprising a groove (5) extending along the longitudinal direction of the
joint, the convergence of the male member (4) substantially corresponding

to the divergence of the female member (5), wherein the male member
is adapted to be freely introducable into the female member until it

reaches an introduced position in which substantially the entire surfaces
of the lateral wall portions (6, 7) thereof introduced into the female member

bear against wall portions (7) of the female member, the dimensions
of the male (4) and female (5) members being so chosen with respect to

each other that the end surfaces of the rib are located at a certain distance
from the bottom of the groove in said introduced position, 
characterized
 in that the respective rib is adapted to be pressed a small distance
further into the respective groove, starting from said introduced position,

while deforming the rib and adjacent element portions so that a
tightening wedge action is obtained, the sheet surfaces on either side of

the joint being arranged to be located in substantially the same plane after
this further inward pressing, and in that the male and female members

of the element portions are designed to be brought into engagement with
each other by a relative movement thereof substantially perpendicular to

the sheet planes of both building elements (1, 1').
A device according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that both element portions (2) have a male as well as a
female member in the form of a rib (4) and a groove (5) having a lateral

wall in common.
A device according to claim 2,
characterized
 in that both elements (1, 1') have a rib (4") and a groove
(5") each also along at least one end border (31) extending substantially

perpendicularly to the joint border, and that a material saving (32) corresponding 
to substantially the total width of the rib and the groove in the

two sheet plane dimensions is made in the region in which the joint border
and the end border meet in one element (1), while the rib (4") and the

groove (5") of the end border of the other element (1') continue to the
joint border, so that a relative movement of the elements along the joint in

the form of a displacement of said one element (1) towards said end border
of the other element (1') is restricted by the fact that the joint rib (4) of

said one element (1) comes to bear against the end rib (4") of the other
element (1').
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that both element portions (2) are arranged to overlap
each other in the direction perpendicular to the sheet plane of the elements

in the engagement state, so that the joint line (10) between the
elements on one side thereof is displaced with respect to the joint line

(11) on the other side.
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that at least the surfaces (6, 7) of the two elements (1,
1') which are adapted to form a joint therebetween as well as 
the sheet
plane surfaces located on one side of the elements are covered by aluminium

foil (9) for reflecting especially radon gas.
A device according to any preceding claim,
characterized
 in that the building elements comprise a body of insulating
material having small aluminium foil pieces (25) in particular arranged to

reflect radon gas embedded and distributed therein.
A device according to any preceding claim,
characterized
 in that the building elements comprise a sheet-like body
having one or more air channels (27) extending therein between the

sheet planes and therealong and adapted to be connected to means (29)
for generating a negative air pressure therein so as to conduct away,

through these air channels, substances, such as radon gas, entering into
the element (26) and prevent the substances from passing through the

element. 
A device according to claim 7,
characterized
 in that the body of the building elements is made of hard
foamed plastic having perforated tubes (28) moulded in therein and arranged

to form said air channels (27).
A device according to claim 7 or 8,
characterized
 in that said air channels (27) of a first building element are
adapted to be brought into alignment with and be connected to such air

channels in adjacent second building elements for creation of a system of
air channels having a negative pressure in an insulating arrangement,

comprising said building elements.
