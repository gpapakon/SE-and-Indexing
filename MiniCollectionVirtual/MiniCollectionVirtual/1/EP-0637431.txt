<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is provided for suturing a 
perforation in a side wall of a patient's blood vessel. The 

apparatus includes an outer sheath (36) having a longitudinal 
passage defined therethrough. The outer sheath (36) is adapted 

to be inserted through the perforation (30) in the patient's 
blood vessel (24). The apparatus includes at least a first 

suture point and at least a first suture thread attached to 
said first suture point. A carrier device is provided for 

carrying the first suture point in a distal direction 
through the longitudinal passage of the outer sheath (36) into 

the patient's blood vessel (24) and for pulling the first suture 
point in a proximal direction through the side wall (32) of the 

patient's blood vessel (24). At least two such suture points and 
suture threads are preferably so attached to the patient's 

blood vessel (24) and are then utilized to close the perforation (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus 
and methods for closing a perforation in a blood vessel. In 1991, around 3,000,000 punctures of human 
arteries were performed in the United States alone. 
These punctures are usually done for diagnostic cardiac 
or radiological procedures and also for therapeutic 
procedures. Such procedures include coronary and 
peripheral angioplasties and insertion of devices such as 
intra-aortic balloon pumps. The percutaneous puncture of the artery usually is 
performed by sticking the artery with a needle through 
which a guide wire is inserted. Over this guide wire a 
dilator is advanced into the artery, and a sheath is 
often mounted onto the dilator. The dilator is then 
removed and the distal end of the sheath is left inside 
the lumen of the artery. A small proximal segment of the 
sheath is left outside of the artery and outside of the 
skin of the patient. This proximal segment of the sheath 
usually contains a hemostatic valve to prevent bleeding 
from the artery through the sheath. Sheaths currently in use are typically flexible 
having one thin wall. They are usually removed from the 
artery immediately after the procedure or within several 
hours. In recent years, the practice has developed of 
treating many patients with anticoagulation medication  
 
such a Heparin. The presence of the anticoagulation 
medication in the patient's system, of course, 
exacerbates problems of bleeding. One particular problem encountered during such 
surgical procedures is bleeding from the perforation 
after the surgical procedure is completed and the sheath 
is removed. This has typically been addressed in the 
prior art by applying pressure to the location of the 
perforation for twenty to thirty minutes and then 
requiring the patient to lie immobile for many hours. One frequent complication of this prior art 
procedure is that subsequent bleeding from the punctured 
artery results in collection of blood, i.e., hematoma, in 
the subcutaneous tissue. The hematomas are usually not 
large but do require several weeks to heal completely. 
Less frequently, the hematomas are large and create 
serious problems. The patient may have to be transfused, 
and the puncture area will be uncomfortable thus limiting 
the patient's activities. On rare occasions, a so-called 
pseudoaneurysm can develop, which is a space between the 
lumen of the artery and subcutaneous tissue space. These 
often have to be surgically repaired. The present invention is directed to a suture device

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for suturing a perforation in a side 
wall of a patient's blood vessel, comprising: 

   an outer sheath having a longitudinal passage 
defined therethrough, said outer sheath being adapted to be 

inserted through the perforation in the patient's blood 
vessel; 

   a first suture point; 
   a first suture thread attached to said first 

suture point; and 
   carrier means for carrying said first suture point 

in a distal direction through said longitudinal passage of 
said outer sheath into the patient's blood vessel and for 

pulling said first suture point in a proximal direction 
through the side wall of the patient's blood vessel. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, and including a 
second suture point; a second suture thread attached to said 

second suture point; and wherein said carrier means further 
provides a means for carrying said second suture point in 

said distal direction through said longitudinal passage of 
said outer sheath into the patient's blood vessel and for 

pulling said second suture point in said proximal direction 
through the side wall of the patient's blood vessel at a 

circumferentially spaced position around said perforation 
from said first suture point. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein 
perforation closing means are provided for pulling said 

suture points laterally toward each other when a tension 
force is applied to said suture threads after said suture 

points are placed through the side wall. 
Apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, wherein said 
carrier means comprises an elongated carrier shaft having a 

proximal end and a distal end; and first and second 
 

laterally extendable arms connected to said distal end of 
said carrier shaft, said first and second suture points 

being carried by said first and second arms, respectively. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said arms 
are extendable from a retracted position wherein said arms 

are received in said longitudinal passage of said outer 
sheath, to a laterally extended position wherein said arms 

extend laterally beyond said sheath. 
Apparatus according to claim 4 or 5, wherein said 
indicator means are located on said shaft, for indicating an 

orientation of said arms within the blood vessel to a 
physician viewing said proximal end of said shaft. 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6, wherein said 
intermediate insertion sheath means are provided for 

compressing said arms to a laterally retracted position and 
for inserting said arms into said longitudinal passage of 

said outer sheath. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, 
wherein said carrier means comprises an elongated carrier 

shaft having a proximal end and a distal end; and a first 
laterally extendable arm connected to a proximal portion of 

said shaft, said first suture point being carried by said 
first arm. 
Apparatus according to claim 8, wherein said first 
arm is hollow and has an arm passage extending therethrough; 

and said first suture thread extends through said arm 
passage of said first arm. 
Apparatus according to claim 8 or 9, wherein said 
carrier shaft has a longitudinal shaft passage defined 

therein, and said first suture thread extends through said 
shaft passage.
