<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a color video camera apparatus
comprising a solid-state image sensor with a complementary color mosaic filter and
more particularly to a variable color matrix circuit for use in such a video camera
apparatus to obtain a higher color fidelity.EP-A-0,429,992 discloses a white balnce adjusting apparatus for
automatically adjusting white balance in response to a luminance information signal and
color information signals obtained from an image sensing device. A CCD sensor and a
color separator provide RGB color signals. The R and B color signals are amplified by
controllable amplifiers. The G signal and the amplified R and B signals are matrixed to
form a luminance signal Y, and R-Y and B-Y color difference signals. When it is
determined that the luminance signal Y for a given region exceeds a predetermined
value, the color signals R and B of that region are attenuated by a predetermined
amount, the gain settings or coefficients of said controllable amplifiers depending on the output signals of the color matrix, that is the signals Y, R-Y and B-Y. As a result, the effect of an object of high luminance towards white balance
adjustment is reduced.US-A-5,034,805 discloses a color separation circuit arrangement for
separating color components from an image sensor that outputs two kinds of photo-electric
conversion signals with different color components for each horizontal scanning
line. The sensor is equipped with alternating yellow and cyan color filters on lines 4n,
and alternating magenta and green color filters on lines 4n+1. Color separation is
carried out by causing color separation arithmetic means to perform a color separation
by supplying the arithmetic means with two kinds of photo-electric conversion signals
for read unit regions that are formed adjacently on the same horizontal scanning line,
output by the image sensors. The color separation apparatus includes signal averaging
means for evaluating the average of a plurality of photoelectic conversion signals of at
least one kind out of the two kinds of photoelectic conversion signals from the read unit
regions provided adjacently on the same horizontal scanning line, and supplying the
result of the evaluation to the color separation arithmetic means.In a conventional color video camera apparatus with a single CCD image
sensor, a complementary color mosaic filter is generally used for generating two color
difference signals in addition to a luminance signal. For example, in the case where a
complementary color
