<ABSTRACT>
In a computer system including a plurality of interlinked 
computers, programming means is provided which enables users 

of the computers to simultaneously hold a video conference and 
share an application program running on one of the computers. 

Each computer has a video camera capable of transmitting video 
information to the other computers. An application program 

running on one of the computers produces a display which is 
replicated on the other computers by transmitting graphics 

function calls thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a computer system including a plurality of interlinked
computers.Modern telephone systems allow multiple parties at different locations to hold a
conference. However, telephone conferences do not provide all of the conveniences of a
face-to-face conference, where participants all meet at a common table in a meeting
room. For example, in a meeting room, participants can view an object of interest, such
as a drawing or a product. Such viewing is not possible in a telephone conference.It is known from TELENORMA NACHRICHTEN, no.93/N, 24 June 1993,
FRANKFURT/MAIN, DE, pages 3-10, KUMMEROW: 'MOGLICHKEITEN DER
MULTIMEDIAKOMMUNIKATION' and IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE
ON COMMUNICATIONS '93, vol.2/3, 26 May 1993, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND,
pages 1177-1182, TOYOSAWA ET AL.: 'A WINDOW AUTOMANAGEMENT
SCHEME FOR A MULTIMEDIA-MULTIPOINT TELECONFERENCE' to provide
teleconference systems employing multi-window arrangements which allow for the
display of real-time video images along side windows relating to an application program
running on a host machine which can be shared by all participants to the teleconference.
However, the scope within which the application program can be shared is
disadvantageously limited.It is an object of the present invention to provide a computer system adapted to
enable an efficient conferencing capability.Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a computer
system, including a plurality of interlinked computers at different locations all adapted to
operate in a similar message-driven, multi-tasking operating environment, including
control means adapted to allow users of the computers to simultaneously hold a video
conference and share an application program running on one of the said computers,
characterized in that a computer of said system includes a relational database means
containing data records relating to each of the computers of the system, said relational
database means being adapted to associate a video image of a potential user with each
data record and to display the video image of the user during a video conference
involving that computer. One embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example,
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-Figure 1 illustrates three computers, connected by telephone lines.Figure 2 initiates an example, which will be elaborated in Figures 3-14. In the
example, a calculator program is operated, and annotated, by various parties.Figure 3 illustrates how the system

<CLAIMS>
A computer system, including a plurality of interlinked computers at different
locations all adapted to operate in a similar message-driven, multi-tasking operating

environment, including control means adapted to allow users of the computers to
simultaneously hold a video conference and share an application program running on one

of the said computers, characterized in that a computer of said system includes a
relational database means containing data records relating to each of the computers of the

system, said relational database means being adapted to associate a video image of a
potential user with each data record and to display the video image of the user during a

video conference involving that computer.
A computer system according to Claim 1, characterized in that the relational
database is adapted to associate multiple video images of potential users of the system

with each data record.
A computer system according to Claim 1, characterized in that all of the said
plurality of computers are adapted to share any application program arranged to run on

any one of the plurality of computers under the said operating environment.
A computer system according to Claim 1, wherein each of the said plurality of
computers is arranged to run a different application to be shared.
A computer system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said
computers are provided with respective video cameras.
A computer system according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the control means is adapted to replicate a portion of the image displayed on the

computer on which said application program is running on other ones of said computers
by transmitting graphics function calls thereto. 
A computer system according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that said control means is adapted to enable said application program to control a visual

image in one region of the displays of said computers and to permit video images to appear
in another region of the displays of said computers.
