<ABSTRACT>
The machine for loading and tipping glass sheets 
comprises essentially at least one frame (6) pivotable 

about a horizontal axis (a) and provided with suction 
elements (7) adapted to be brought into contact with the 

surface of a sheet (2) in a pack of sheets (3) located on 
a bed; the pivotable frame is adapted to be pivoted into 

a position in which it is substantially parallel to a 
horizontal support structure (5) to deposit the sheet on 

this structure; on the basis of the invention there are 
provided means (11) for displacing the horizontal axis 

(a) of the pivotable frame (6) substantially upwardly and 
inwardly of the support structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a loading and tipping 
machine for glass sheets adapted to take glass sheets in 
succession from a pack of superposed sheets disposed on 
a bed and to transfer and tip each of the sheets onto a 
substantially horizontal support structure. A machine of this type comprises essentially at least one 
frame which is pivotable about a horizontal axis parallel 
to the sheets in the said pack and provided with suction 
elements adapted to be brought into contact with the 
surface of the sheets. Moreover this frame is fixed to 
the support structure at least by an extensible rod 
having first and second ends pivotally connected to the 
support structure and to the pivotable frame 
respectively, the extensible rod further including a 
hydraulic cylinder adapted to vary the length of the rod 
itself to move the pivotable frame from a first position, 
in which it is substantially vertical and the suction 
elements are in contact with the said surface of one of 
the sheets, to a second position in which the frame 
deposits the glass sheet on the first said support 
structure. In known machines of this type 
(see DE-A-2 357 118), 
the pivotable frame is  
 
normally hinged to a carriage movable transversely on a 
framework of the machine in a direction perpendicular to 
the pivot axis of the frame itself so as to enable it to 
be moved towards and away from the pack of sheets. Known loading and tipping machines of the type described 
briefly above have several disadvantages. First of all, with such machines, during the step in 
which each sheet is taken from the pack of sheets, 
problems may arise as a result of adherence between the 
sheet subsequent to that which is to be taken and the 
sheet being taken; consequently, in several cases, either 
two sheets are taken simultaneously or the sheets 
underlying that which is to be taken are displaced 
undesirably. To avoid these problems, machines have also 
been proposed in which the suction elements are carried 
by a plate which is connected to the first pivotable 
frame defined above by means of a complex of connecting 
rods so as to allow the plate itself to pivot relative to 
the frame. At least one hydraulic cylinder is interposed 
between the first and the second to cause the pivoting of 
the plate relative to the frame at the same time as the 
frame is pivoted relative to the framework of the 
machine; thus the two pivotal movements of the frame 
relative to the framework and of the plate relative to 
the frame result in a

of the support structure (5) so that, during this 
displacement with the length of the rod (8) being kept  

 
constant, the frame (6) moves away from the pack (4) 

while not being kept parallel to the pack itself so that 
the distance (d
t
) between the lower part of the frame and 
the pack of sheets becomes greater than the distance (d
s
) 
between the upper part of the frame and the pack of 

sheets.
