<ABSTRACT>
Device for monitoring the discharge of a plurality of series-connected batteries, characterised in that it comprises a plurality of identical individual modules (1) respectively mounted in parallel with the terminals of each of the batteries (2), and in that each module (1) possesses:     - a reference voltage source (1b), - a processing means (1a) linked, on the one hand, respectively to the terminals (E
<
+

, E
<
-
>
) of the battery (2) and, on the other hand, to a first conductor (4) for linking a central unit (6) to the set of modules (1) mounted in series, - a comparator means (1c) linked, on the one hand, to the source (1b) and, on the other hand, to the processing means (1a),   - a switch (1d) slaved to the output of the comparator means (1c), and in that the said module (1) controls means (7) for warning of a threshold in the discharging of the battery at the terminals of which it is mounted.

Device for monitoring the discharge of a plurality of mounted batteries
comprising a plurality of identical individual modules (1) respectively mounted

in parallel to the terminals of each of the batteries (2), and in that each module
(1) is provided with:


a reference voltage supply (1b),
a processing means (1a) connected on the one hand respectively to the
terminals (E
+
, E
-
) of the battery (2) and on the other hand to a first connecting
conductor (4) of a central unit (6) to the assembly of modules (1) mounted in

series,
a comparator (1c) connected on the one hand to the supply (1b) and on the
other hand to the processing means (1a),
a switch (1d) controlled at the output of the comparator (1c),

and in that said module (1) controls alarm means (7) for a discharge threshold
of the battery on the terminals of which 
it is mounted.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the discharge threshold is
adjusted by a control signal generated by the central unit (6) and transmitted

simultaneously to the assembly of modules (1) by the first connecting
conductor (4).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the processing means (1a) is
constituted by an optical coupler connected to an RC circuit.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the switch (1d) is constituted
by a MOSFET transistor (T2) connected to a diode (D2).
