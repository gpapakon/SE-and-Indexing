<ABSTRACT>
A cartridge receives a variety of optical disks. The cartridge has 
a hinged lid for easy insertion and removal of the disks. A rotatable 

hub is mounted within the cartridge to receive the disks. An adaptor 
ring may be inserted into the cartridge to allow the cartridge to receive 

disks of different diameters. The cartridge is inserted into an optical 
drive which is able to operate with a variety of disks which may be 

inserted into the cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to optical disk cartridges 
and systems employing such cartridges and more specifically to a 
cartridge which allows the removal of optical disks from the cartridge. Optical data storage systems, such as optical disk drives, use 
laser beams to record and read data to and from optical data storage 
disks. The optical disks are typically packaged in a cartridge in order 
to protect the disk and allow easy insertion and removal from the disk 
drive. Examples of optical disk cartridges include U.S. Patent 5,073,889, 
issued December 17, 1991; U.S. Patent 4,945,530, issued July 31, 1990; 
U.S. Patent 4,908,817, issued March 13, 1990; European Patent Application 
463575, published January 2, 1992; Canadian Patent Application 2,002,481, 
published May 11, 1990; Japanese Patent Application 03-185689, published 
August 13, 1991; Japanese Patent Application 02-187973, published July 
24, 1990; Japanese Patent Application 02-121174, published May 9, 1990; 
and Japanese Patent Application 62-47893, published March 2, 1987. There are a number of different types of optical disks. Compact 
disks (CD) or compact disk read only memory (CD-ROM) contain information 
encoded as permanent embedded pits or marks in the disks. These disks 
may not be written upon by the user. They are typically 120 millimetres 
in diameter and do not have an integral hub at the centre. Writable disks include write once read many (WORM) and magneto-optical 
(MO). These disks allow the user to both record and read data to 
and from the disk. These disks are typically 130 millimetres in diameter 
and have a central, integral hub. Due to the differences in types of 
optical disks, it has not been possible for one drive to accommodate all 
types of disks. Instead, each has its own unique cartridge which may 
only be used in an optical drive specifically designed for use with that 
cartridge. This places limitations on the users ability to use a variety 
of disks. Also, the requirement that each optical disk have its own 
unique cartridge adds to the cost of the optical storage system. What is needed is an inexpensive optical disk cartridge system 
which will receive various types of optical disks and allow them to be 
played in a single optical disk drive.  Accordingly the present invention provides, in a first aspect, 
provides an optical data storage cartridge comprising: a housing member 
having an inner chamber sized to receive a hubless optical disk, the 
housing member having an opening member for

<CLAIMS>
An optical data storage cartridge comprising: 
   a housing member having an inner chamber sized to receive a hubless 

optical disk, the housing member having an opening member for providing 
access to the inner chamber, such that the optical disk may be removed 

from the inner chamber; and 
   a rotatable hub member mounted to a surface of the inner chamber 

and sized to receive a central aperture of the optical disk. 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 1, wherein the opening member is a 
hinge mounted lid. 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the opening 
member has a locking means for locking the opening member in a closed 

position. 
A cartridge as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the housing 
member further includes a spindle aperture for providing access to a 

spindle to the inner chamber. 
A cartridge as claimed in any previous claim, wherein the housing 
member further comprises a first disk access aperture for providing 

access to the disk in the inner chamber. 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 5, further comprising a first 
shutter means for covering the first disk access aperture. 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 5, further comprising a second disk 
access aperture for providing access to the disk in the inner chamber. 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 7, further comprising a shutter 
means for covering the second disk access aperture. 
A cartridge as claimed in any previous claim, wherein the mass of 
the hub is such that the mass of the hub and the hubless optical disk is 

in the range between the mass of an ISO standard single sided hubbed 
optical disk and an ISO standard double sided hubbed optical disk. 
The cartridge as claimed in any previous claim, wherein the hub is 
mounted to allow limited lateral linear movement. 
A cartridge as claimed in any previous claim, wherein the hub is 
mounted to allow limited axial linear movement. 
A cartridge as claimed in any previous claim, wherein the hub has a 
bevelled edge for receiving the disk. 
A cartridge as claimed in claim 12, wherein the angle of the 
bevelled edge is in the range of 10-45 degrees. 
A cartridge as claimed in any previous claim, wherein the hub is
