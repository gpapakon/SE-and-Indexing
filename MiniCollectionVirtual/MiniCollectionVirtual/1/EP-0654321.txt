<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a process for manufacturing a longeron (1) of a road or rail transport vehicle. The process consists in forming a steel strip by cold-forming (profiling) into a section, comprising a web (2) and two flanges (3, 4) extending over the entire length of the web (2) and perpendicular to the said web (2), in cutting, over at least part of the length of the section, a flange (3) or a flange (3) and a portion of the web (2) adjacent to this flange (3), and in bending, in the region of the cut part, the web (2) over part of its height in order to reform a flange (3a) and to obtain, in the region of the said cut part, a web (2a) having a height less than the height of the web (2b) in the other part of the section (10). The subject of the invention is also a longeron for a road or rail transport vehicle, obtained by this process.
