<ABSTRACT>
A rotatable turbine frame (48,50) includes annular outer and inner bands (48b,50b) 
having a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart struts (48a,50a) extending therebetween. 

An annular drive shaft (48d,50d) is fixedly joined to the inner band (48c,50c) for transmitting 
output torque therefrom, and the struts (48a,50a) are backwardly radially inclined relative 

to the direction of rotation of the frame (48,50) so that gas flow between the struts (48a,50a) 
tends to straighten the inclined struts (48a,50a) to effect a compressive load 

component therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and, more 
specifically, to a rotating turbine frame therein. Conventional gas turbine engines include one or more rotors which are suitably 
mounted in bearings and supported by stationary frames. The frames provide rigidity for 
controlling the dynamic response of the rotor system and for minimizing blade tip clearances 
due to inherent flexibility during operation. Multiple rotors in a gas turbine engine increase the complexity of the mounting 
system therefor, and engines having counterrotating power turbines yet further increase the 
complexity of the system. In one exemplary counterrotating power turbine design as 
disclosed in US Patent Application Serial No. 08/080,666, 
filed 18 June 1993, (= US-A- 5361580) entitled "Gas Turbine Engine Rotor 
Support system," assigned to the present assignee, (Docket No. 
13DV-11713), a rotor support system includes rotating forward and aft turbine frames 
integrally joined to outer and inner rotors of a counterrotating power turbine. The turbine 
frames provide increased structural rigidity of the power turbine for controlling blade tip 
clearances, but since the turbine frames rotate, they are subject to centrifugally generated 
tensile stresses in the struts thereof. Accordingly, the struts must be suitably designed to 
accommodate the centrifugal tensile stresses for obtaining a suitable useful life of the power 
turbine. A rotatable turbine frame includes annular outer and inner bands having a plurality 
of circumferentially spaced apart struts extending therebetween. An annular drive shaft is 
fixedly joined to the inner band for transmitting output torque therefrom, and the struts are 
backwardly radially inclined relative to the direction of rotation of the frame so that gas flow 
between the struts tends to straighten the inclined struts to effect a compressive load  
 
component therein. The invention, in accordance with preferred and exemplary embodiments, together 
with further objects and advantages thereof, is more particularly described in the following 
detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 is a schematic, longitudinal partly sectional view of an exemplary turbofan 
gas turbine engine having a counterrotating power turbine including rotating turbine frames 
in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Figure 2 is an enlarged longitudinal, partly sectional view of the power turbine 
illustrated in Figure 1
