<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a heating rail (14) used to heat a passing thread in a false-twist crimping machine for crimping a synthetic fiber (38), with a heating surface heated to more than 250  DEG C and a number of thread guides (32) which are arranged alternatingly on one side and then the other of a common mid-plane perpendicular to the heating rail and which jut out over the mid-plane with their curved contact surface, alternating from one side to the other so that the successive contact surfaces guide the thread by their curvature on a zig-zag course with an amplitude U and a thread-guide spacing A, where the amplitude U is 6 to 15, preferably 9 to 14, per mill of the spacing A, the diameter of the contact surfaces is 8 to 25 mm, preferably 10 to 20 mm.

Heating rail for heating the moving yarn (38) in a
false twist crimping machine for crimping a synthetic

yarn (38),

having a heating surface, which is heated up to more
than 250Â° C, and a plurality of yarn guides (32),


which are disposed on alternate sides of a common
centre plane perpendicular to the heating

surface,
which with a curved contact surface project
beyond the centre plane from alternate sides in

such a way that the successive contact surfaces
guide the yarn (38) by means of their curved

contact surfaces along a zigzag course having the
amplitude U and the yarn guide spacing A,
characterized in that
the amplitude U is 6 to 15%, preferably 9-14%
of the spacing A,
the diameter of the contact surfaces is 8 to
25 mm, preferably 10 to 20 mm.
Heating rail according to claim 1,
characterized in that

the heating rail has a longitudinal groove, the bottom
of which forms the heating surface and the side walls

(18, 20, 22) of which have recesses (28), into which
are let the yarn guides which project into the groove,

that the yarn guides are cylinders (32), the jacket of
which forms the curved contact surface and which are

disposed offset relative to one another on either side
of their common centre plane (50).
Heating rail according to claim 2,
characterized in that

the recesses (28) have a cylindrical cross section
which is adapted to the cross section of the yarn

guides, the recesses in the walls forming a gap (30),
through which the respective yarn guide (32) projects 

into the groove (12) with a part of its cross-sectional
surface which is smaller than the part of

the yarn guide situated in the recess (28).
Heating rail according to claim 3,
characterized in that

the yarn guides (32) and the recesses (28) have a
circular-cylindrical cross section.
Heating rail according to one of claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that

the yarn guides (32) are conically (34) bevelled at
their end remote from the heating surface.
Heating rail according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that

the heating rail has two parallel grooves (12) and
that the dividing wall (20) situated between the two

grooves is greater than the radius and smaller than
the diameter of the recesses, which are formed in said

dividing wall and in which the yarn guides (32) are
inserted.
Heating rail according to claim 6,
characterized in that

the diameter of the yarn guides (32) inserted in the
dividing wall (20) is greater than the diameter of the

yarn guides inserted in the side walls (18; 22).
Heating rail according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that

at least some of the yarn guides are provided at a
distance from the groove bottom with a guide (43)

which axially defines the yarn course.
Heating rail according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that
 
provided in a longitudinal direction of the

longitudinal groove (12) is a plurality of groove
spacers (40) which bridge the groove at a distance

from the groove bottom.
Heating rail according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that

placed onto each of the side walls is a sheet metal
cap, which extends in a longitudinal direction of the

heating rail and which rests on the end faces of the
yarn guides and covers at least part of the end faces

of the yarn guides which project beyond the side wall.
Heating rail according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that

the rail at its underside has longitudinal grooves,
into which resistance heaters (24) are inserted, and

that the resistance heaters (24) are clamped to the
heating rail and covered by means of a clamping

element.
Heating apparatus having two heating rails according
to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that

the heating apparatus comprises an elongate, straight
fastening rail, to which the heating rails are

fastened by means of spacers, preferably with an - in
yarn course - ascending and descending slope.
Heating apparatus according to claim 12,
characterized in that

the fastening rail takes the form of a channel
section, the side flanks of which embrace the heating

rails.
