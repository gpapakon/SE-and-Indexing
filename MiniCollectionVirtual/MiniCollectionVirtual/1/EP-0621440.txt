The invention relates to an element (1) made of transparent 
material for varying the light rays from an illuminating 

means (10), whereby light rays (B) hitting the element at an angle of 
more than 45° from the optical axis of the element are deflected 

at least partly so as to be emitted by the element 
at an angle of less than 45° (B').

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an element made of 
transparent material for varying the light rays from an illuminating 
means. Illuminating means are used to a great extent for illuminating 
useful architectural areas and business areas. 
Their design and construction are aimed essentially at obtaining 
high light efficiencies at a low expenditure of energy. 
The disadvantages of most illuminating means hitherto 
used are that great quantities of light cannot be utilized 
due to light scatter and that this light scatter furthermore 
has an undesirable and unfavorable dazzling effect. Reflectors 
of illuminating means frequently have a shield behavior 
that does not meet German industrial standard recommendations 
(DIN 5035), and corrections of the shield behavior 
impair the reflector's light distribution curve. The present invention is based on the problem of providing 
an element for optimally correcting the shield behavior 
of illuminating means or reflectors, taking account 
of not only lighting aspects but also esthetic aspects. The invention is based on the idea of providing the 
shield by a transparent body whose geometry is such that 
this is achieved by refraction and inner reflection. The object of the present invention is an element made 
of transparent material for varying the light rays from an 
illuminating means, whereby light rays hitting the element 
at an angle of more than 45° from the optical axis of the 
element are deflected at least partly so as to be emitted by 
the element at an angle of less than 45°. If such an element is placed before an illuminating 
means or a reflector one can obtain an optimal illumination 
of the surface to be illuminated while simultaneously suppressing 
the dazzling effect.  In a preferred embodiment the predominant portion of 
light rays are deflected so as to be emitted by the element 
at an angle of less than 45°. This makes it possible to utilize the light scatter 
fraction optimally for illuminating a room or workplace. It is further preferred to simultaneously deflect a 
portion of the light scatter such that the light rays are 
emitted by the element at an angle of less than 90° from the 
optical axis in the direction of the incident light rays. In this embodiment a portion of the light scatter can 
thus be used to illuminate the ceiling, which is advantageous 
under certain room conditions. The outer geometrical shape of the element is widely 
variable. For optical-physical reasons, however, a hemispherical, 
ellipsoid, truncated-cone or
