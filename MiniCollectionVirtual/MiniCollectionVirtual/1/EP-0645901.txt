<ABSTRACT>
The invention described herein concerns a 
telecommunications and remote sensing system based on 

the use of a number of satellites placed in elliptical 
sun-synchronous orbits, inclined with respect to the 

equatorial plane, having an orbital period of 
approximately three hours. It belongs to the technical 

field of artificial satellites and can be 
advantageously applied to satellite telecommunications 

including communication through mobile and personal 
means; radiolocation and radio navigation; simplex or 

duplex data transmission between small terminals; radio 
broadcasting; emergency communications. 
The invention is also applicable to the field of Earth 
observation, in particular with optical sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a satellite telecommunications
and remote sensing system, based on the use of a number of
satellites placed in elliptical sun-synchronous orbits, inclined
with respect to the equatorial plane, having an orbital period
of approximately three hours.The Article "Satellite Communications Systems", by G. Maral and
M. Bousquet, 1993, pages 234, 276 to 282, which is the most
pertinent prior art document, discloses the basic principle of
sun-synchronous orbits. Further, it is stated that it is
possible to phase sun-synchronous orbits such that the period of
the orbit is a sub-multiple of the sidereal day or an integer
number of days.The system according to the invention may be used advantageously
for the telecommunications via satellite when it may be
necessary to settle 
simplex or duplex radio communication within a country
or geographical areas which are homogeneous as regards
language, culture, ethnicity or socio-economic
interests, or between countries situated in
non-contiguous geographical areas. The
telecommunications services, for which the invention
provides significant economical advantages, include,
among other things: personal communications;
communication through ground, sea and air mobile means;
remote radio-location of the position of mobile means,
and radio navigation; personal selective remote
indication; simplex or duplex data transmission between
small fixed or portable terminals; direct radio
broadcasting of radio or TV programs; teleconferences;
emergency communications; data dissemination and
collection.The invention is also applicable to regional remote
sensing, in particular in the field of meteorology and
Earth observation using optical sensors.On the basis of the invention, the sun-synchronisation
features of the orbit and the position of the orbital
plane (essentially according to the normal to the solar
rays), in comparison with other satellite systems used
for the same applications, make it possible to simplify
the satellite configuration, especially as regards:
power generation on the part of the solar generator;
storage of electrical power through rechargeable
batteries; and thermal conditioning of the satellite.The inclination of the orbital plane with respect to
the equator is equivalent to 116.4° in order to annul
the rotation of the line of apsides. The eccentricity
of the orbit and the orbital period, which results from
the choice of a sun-synchronous orbit with an 
inclination of 116.4°, together with the value of the
inclination and an
