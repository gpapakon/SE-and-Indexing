<ABSTRACT>
Macrocyclic polyetherimide oligomer 
compositions are prepared by a displacement reaction at a 

temperature in the range of about 200-225°C between at 
least one fluorinated aromatic phthalimide and at least one 

phenolic trialkylsilyl ether compound. Preferably, a bis-fluoroimide 
and a bis-trialkylsilyl ether of a 

dihydroxyaromatic compound such as resorcinol are 
employed. The reaction is conducted by maintaining 

reagents A and B in high dilution in a dipolar aprotic organic 
liquid such as N-methylpyrrolidone, and in the presence of a 

catalytic amount of at least one substantially soluble 
fluoride. Preferably, a mixture of reagents A and B is added 

to solvent containing the catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 
macrocyclic oligomer compositions, and more particularly 
to the preparation of macrocyclic polyetherimide oligomers. Copending, commonly owned application Serial 
No. 08/080,550 discloses a class of macrocyclic polyimide 
oligomer compositions not containing spiro(bis)indane 
moieties. Said compositions may be converted to linear 
polyimides. By reason of the low viscosities of the 
oligomer compositions in comparison to the linear 
polymers, said compositions are capable of employment in 
areas from which polyimides have previously been barred. According to said application, the macrocyclic 
polyimide oligomers are prepared by the reaction of 
equimolar amounts of at least one tetracarboxylic acid or 
its dianhydride and at least one diamine. Said reaction 
requires pseudo-high dilution conditions; i.e., maintenance 
of the reagents at high dilution. Since the condensation 
reaction between the acid and the diamine is slow, the rate 
of reagent introduction must also be slow and the reaction 
may take several hours to go to completion. In recent years, there has been an increase in 
interest in the preparation of polyetherimides, a subgenus 
of polyimides, by the reaction of substituted bis-phthalimides 
with derivatives, most often salts, of 
dihydroxyaromatic compounds. Reference is made, for 
example, to copending, commonly owned application Serial 
No. 07/661,947. It has now been discovered that macrocyclic 
polyetherimide oligomer compositions, capable of  
 
conversion to linear polyetherimides as described in said 
application, can be prepared by the reaction of fluorinated 
bis-phthalimides with trialkylsilyl ethers of 
dihydroxyaromatic compounds under appropriate conditions. 
As in the earlier methods for preparation of such 
compositions, the required conditions include pseudo-high 
dilution. The invention is a method for preparing a 
composition comprising macrocyclic polyetherimide 
oligomers which comprises effecting a displacement 
reaction between (A) at least one fluorinated aromatic 
phthalimide and (B) at least one phenolic trialkylsilyl ether 
compound, each of reagents A and B having two moieties 
selected from the group consisting of fluorinated 
phthalimide and trialkylsilyl ether moieties and the molar 
proportions of trialkylsilyl ether and fluorinated 
phthalimide moieties being equal;
 
   reagents A and B being maintained throughout 
the reaction in high dilution in a dipolar aprotic organic 
liquid;
