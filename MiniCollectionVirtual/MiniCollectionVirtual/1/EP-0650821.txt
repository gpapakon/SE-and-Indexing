<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for manufacturing corner cladding elements comprising corner plates (21), plane plates (22, 22') and/or gaps having the dimensions of the said plates so as to allow connection to adjacent panels during installation on a worksite; the said plates being arranged in a foamed support (23) with spaces (25) corresponding to ordinary seals (joints) made up from sand bound by the material of the foamed support (23); the said foamed support (23) being formed in two successive operating steps.

Process for manufacturing angle facing 
elements comprising angle plates (21), flat plates (22, 

22') and/or cavities according to the plate sizes so as 
to allow the binding with adjacent panels upon laying out 

on a site, said plates being arranged in a foamed support 
(23) with gaps (25) corresponding to ordinary joints 

formed with sand binded with the foamed support material, 
characterized in that said foamed support (23) is formed 

in two successive operating steps. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized 
in that two successive operating steps are carried out, 

in which : 

in a first step, the plates (21, 22) and/or 
protuberances are arranged in the bottom of an 

essentially flat mould so as to form cavities according 
to the plate sizes, 
the gaps (25) between the plates (21, 22) 
and/or the protuberances are filled with dry sized sand, 
the mould is covered with a first part of a 
lid (19) comprising a wedge (17), 
foam is injected into the mould, 
the mold is covered with the second part of 
the lid, said lid being arranged toward the rear side of 

the plates (21, 22) so as to allow foam expansion on the 
rear side of said plates (21, 22) et protuberances, 

forming thereby with the wedge a bevel (27) substantially 
according to the bisecting line of the angle plates (21), 
the resulting element is stripped out from 
the mould, 
the resulting element together with flat 
plates (22') and/or protuberances is then arranged in the 

bottom of a second mould after a rotation by 90°,  
 
the gaps between the plates (21, 22') and/or 
the protuberances are filled with dry sized sand, 
foam is injected into the mould, 
the mould is covered with a lid (19) so as to 
allow foam expansion on the rear side of the plates (21, 

22') and/or protuberances up to the formed bevel (27), 
and 
the so obtained angle facing element is 
stripped out from the mould. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized 
in that two successive operating steps are carried out, 

in which : 

in a first step, the plates (21, 22) and/or 
protuberances are arranged in the bottom of an 

essentially flat mould so as to form cavities according 
to the plate sizes, 
the gaps (25) between the plates (21, 22) 
and/or the protuberances are filled with dry sized sand, 
the mould is covered with a lid comprising a 
wedge, said lid being arranged toward the rear side of 

the plates (21, 22) so as to allow foam expansion on the 
rear side of said plates (21, 22) and/or protuberances, 

forming thereby with the wedge a bevel (27) substantially 
according to the bisecting line of the angle plates (21), 
foam is injected through an injection orifice 
arranged in the wall of said mould, 
the resulting element is stripped out from 
the mould, 
the resulting element together with flat 
plates (22') and/or protuberances is then arranged in the 

bottom of a second mould after a rotation by 90°, 
the gaps between the plates (21, 22') and/or 
the protuberances are filled with dry sized sand, 
the mould is covered with a lid (19), 
foam is injected into the mould through an 
orifice arranged in the wall of said mould so as to allow 

foam expansion on the rear side of the plates (21, 22')  
 

and/or protuberances up to the formed bevel (27), and 
the so obtained angle facing element is 
stripped out from the mould. 
Device used for implementing the process for 
manufacturing angle facing elements according to any of 

claims 1 to 3, comprising at least one substantially flat 
mould arranged to receive plates (21, 22) and/or 

protuberances so as to form cavities according to the 
plate sizes as well as the foam used to make the foamed 

support of the angle elements, said mould being provided 
with a lid (19), characterized in that the lid, 

preferably formed with two parts, comprises a wedge (17). 
Device according to claim 4, characterized 
in that it comprises a second substantially flat moold 

which is arranged to receive the element already formed 
in the first mould and also comprises a lid. 
Device according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the mould comprises lugs. 
Device according to any of claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that the mould comprises a foam 

injecting orifice. 
Angle facing element comprising plates (21, 
22, 23') and/or cavities according to the plate sizes in 

a foamed support (23) with elements with gaps (25) 
corresponding to ordinary joints formed with sand binded 

by the foamed support material, characterized in that the 
foamed support (23) comprises a bevel (27) corresponding 

to the bisecting line of the angle of the corner angle 
forming plate (21) of the facing element. 
Facing element according to claim 8, 
characterized in that it comprises securing orifices 

(29).
