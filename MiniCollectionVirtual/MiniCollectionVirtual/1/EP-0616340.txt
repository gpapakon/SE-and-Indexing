<ABSTRACT>
A cable (10) for electronic equipment, includes a first set 
(12) of elongate electrically conductive elements 

interspersed with a second set (14) also containing 
electrically conductive elements. Each member of the first 

set (12) is electrically connected to every other member of 
the first set (12) and each member of the first set (12) is 

electrically insulated from every member of the second set 
(14). The current flow in the first set (12) is in one 

direction, and the current flow in the second set (14) is in 
the opposite direction. This enables the magnetic field, 

created by the first set (12), to cancel the magnetic field 
created by the second set (14). The inductivity of the cable 

(10) is thereby substantially reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to cables for electronic equipment. 
Particularly, this invention relates to low impedance cables 
for electronic equipment, which can supply high currents with 
low distortion. Electronic equipment, such as, loud speakers, need to be 
supplied with high currents from the amplifier, particularly 
at low or high frequencies, or both depending upon the 
loudspeaker. Because of the high current, a certain amount 
of distortion is created at the final output, as a result of 
the inductance of the cable and the mechanical vibrations 
created due to the magnetic field along the length of the 
cable. The longer the cable, the greater the inductance. The 
inductance, along with the capacity of the output, such as an 
electrostatic loud speaker, creates a resonant circuit which 
results in a distortion in the reproduced frequency and in 
phase response. This distortion depends upon the length of 
the cable, the ohmic resistance of the cable, and the 
magnitude of the capacitive load applied.  In view of the foregoing, it is the aim of the invention to 
achieve the following objects, either alone or in 
combination:
 
   to provide a low impedance cable for electronic 
equipment;
 
   to provide a cable for electrical/electronic equipment 
which can supply high currents with low distortion;
 
   to provide a cable which attenuates the mechanical 
vibrations due to the magnetic forces between the 
conductors; and
 
   to provide a cable which will reduce distortion in the 
reproduced frequency and phase response in audio 
circuits. According to this invention, there is provided a cable for 
electronic equipment, which includes a first set containing 
at least one elongate electrically conductive element 
interspersed with a second set containing at least one 
electrically conductive element, each member of the first set 
being electrically connected to every other member of the 
first set and each member of the first set being electrically  
 
insulated from every member of the second set and each member 
of the second set being electrically connected to every other 
member of the second set and being electrically insulated 
from every member of the first set, in such a manner that the 
current flow in the first set is in one direction, and the 
current flow in the second set is in the opposite direction, 
enabling the magnetic field, created by the first set, to 
cancel the magnetic field created by the second set, thereby 
at least substantially reducing the inductivity of the cable. In
