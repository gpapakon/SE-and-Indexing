<ABSTRACT>
The control of the burning process in glass tank furnaces with alternating supply of fossil fuels and combustion air on both sides of the tank usually takes place by detecting the actual temperature values in the furnace space and controlling the thermal power depending on these temperature values by means of an air-quantity control (RML) and a fuel-quantity control (RMB) and also by means of corresponding actuators (SL1 and SB) in the air line (20) and in the fuel line (12). In this connection, the ratio of fuel quantity to combustion air quantity is observed. In order to reduce great temperature variations and peak NOx values in the waste gases by switching over the burners for the purpose of reversing the flame direction, the measured temperature values are stored over a series of 1 to n cycles in a first operating phase. From this, a mean temperature value is formed and, in a further operating phase, primarily either the combustion air quantity or the fuel quantity is at least temporarily held at a constant value depending on the mean temperature value formed, and either the fuel-quantity control (RMB) or the air-quantity control (RML) is controlled dependently during this time.
