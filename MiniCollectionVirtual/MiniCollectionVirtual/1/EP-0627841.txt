<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the 
centralized control and monitoring of safety parameters, 
particularly in heating systems. As is known, devices for the centralized control and 
monitoring of heating systems are already commercially 
available; these devices are generally equipped with a 
central management unit which is connected to various 
remote stations so that it can perform remote checking of 
the operating parameters of the various heating systems and 
send the various actuation commands. Connection is provided by means of a telephone cable 
that transmits the data in both directions. Use of a telephone cable has the drawback that it does 
not allow safe reliability in data transmission and 
furthermore entails a relatively long time for acting on 
the heating system; this is very dangerous when monitoring 
essential parameters such as the temperatures and pressures 
of the system, with the risk that late intervention can 
lead to severe damage to the system. A principal aim of the present invention is indeed to 
solve the problem described above by providing a device for 
the centralized control and monitoring of safety 
parameters, particularly in heating systems, that allows to 
drastically reduce intervention times, thus allowing to 
always have all the systems located in the remote stations 
immediately under control while allowing rapid 
intervention, providing considerably higher safety 
standards and criteria.  Within the scope of this aim, a particular object of 
the invention is to provide a device wherein data 
transmission can be performed with two different sources, 
thus significantly increasing reliability. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a device for the centralized control and monitoring of 
safety parameters in heating systems which is capable of 
giving the greatest assurances of reliability and safety in 
use by virtue of its particular constructive 
characteristics. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a device that can be easily obtained starting from commonly 
commercially available elements and materials and at 
competitive costs. With this aim, these objects and others in view, which 
will become apparent hereinafter, the invention provides a 
device for the centralized control and monitoring of safety 
parameters, particularly in heating systems, characterized 
in that it comprises a central unit connected to a data 
concentrator which is connected to remote stations 
associated with the heating systems to be
