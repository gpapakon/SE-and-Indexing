<ABSTRACT>
A fuel supply apparatus for supplying fuel to a compression ignition 
engine comprising a rotary distributor member (11) having a delivery 

passage (13) which can register in turn with outlet ports (14) connected 
to the injection nozzles of the engine. Fuel is supplied to the delivery 

passage from an accumulator (20) under the control of a valve (18). The 
accumulator is charged with fuel by means of a high pressure pump (8) 

which is a cam actuated pump and fuel is supplied to the high pressure 
pump by a low pressure pump (31). A valve (34) is provided to control 

the output pressure of the low pressure pump so that the amount of fuel 
supplied to the high pressure pump can be varied for the purpose of 

controlling the fuel pressure within the accumulator. This pressure is 
sensed by a transducer (35) which supplies a signal to a control system 

(22) which controls the flow of electric current in the valve (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel supply system for supplying fuel to the
injection nozzles of a multi-cylinder compression ignition engine, the
system comprising a cam actuated high pressure pump, an accumulator
space which is charged with fuel by the high pressure pump, a rotary
distributor member including a delivery passage which is arranged to
register in turn with a plurality of outlet ports, the outlet ports being
formed in a housing which supports the distributor member and being
connected in use to the injection nozzles respectively, valve means
operable to connect said delivery passage to the accumulator space to
supply fuel to the engine and to connect said delivery passage to a drain,
and passage means through which fuel can flow to the high pressure
pump.US-A-5078113 shows one example of such a fuel supply system in
which the accumulator comprises a spring biased piston which is housed
within a cylinder and the high pressure pump comprises a pumping
plunger which is spring biased into engagement with an engine driven
cam. The high pressure pump is able to draw fuel from a supply tank
and an adjustable throttle is provided to control the amount of fuel
which is supplied to the high pressure pump, the throttle being coupled
to the accumulator piston so as to be movable thereby.PCT/DE93/00330 which has a priority date before that of the present
application but which was published after the priority date of the present
application shows another example of the supply system and which is
intended to supply fuel at a much higher pressure than the system
disclosed in US-B-5078113. The accumulator comprises a simple 
chamber which is depicted as being formed in the housing of the
apparatus. The fuel pressure in the accumulator space can be controlled
by a simple spring loaded relief valve or by an electromagnetic valve
which is controlled by a control system which receives a pressure signal
from a sensor responsive to the pressure in the accumulator space.The object of the present invention is to provide a fuel system of the
kind specified in an improved form.According to the present invention there is provided a fuel supply system
for supplying fuel to the injection nozzles of a multi-cylinder internal
combustion engine comprising a cam actuated high pressure pump, an
accumulator space which is charged with fuel by the high pressure
pump, a rotary distributor member including a delivery passage which is
arranged to register in turn with a plurality of outlet ports, the outlet ports
being formed in a

<CLAIMS>
A fuel supply system for supplying fuel to the injection nozzles
of a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine comprising a cam

actuated high pressure pump (24, 26), an accumulator space (20) which
is charged with fuel by the high pressure pump, a rotary distributor

member including a delivery passage (13) which is arranged to register in
turn with a plurality of outlet ports (14), the outlet ports being formed in

a housing which supports the distributor member and being connected in
use, to the injection nozzles respectively, valve means (18) operable to

connect said delivery passage (13) to the accumulator space (20) to
supply fuel to the engine and to connect said delivery passage to a drain,

passage means through which fuel can flow to the high pressure pump,
characterized by means (70, 71) operable to limit at least the initial rate of flow of

fuel from the accumulator space (20) to the associated engine, which means
contain a restrictor (70) in series between the accumulator space

(20) and said valve means (18), and an ON/OFF valve (71) connected in
parallel with said restrictor, said ON/OFF valve being opened when a

substantially unrestricted flow of fuel is required.
A fuel supply system as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by an
electrically controlled pressure control valve (34) operable to control the

output pressure of a low pressure pump and an electronic control system
for controlling the operation of said control valve (34) whereby the

output pressure of the low pressure pump can be varied to control the
amount of fuel delivered by the high pressure pump to the accumulator

space. 
A fuel supply system as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in
that said low pressure pump is a vane type pump.
A fuel supply system as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by a
low pressure fuel supply pump which supplies fuel to the high pressure

pump through said passage means, an electrically controlled throttle
valve in said passage means, a pressure sensor for providing a signal

representative of the fuel pressure in the accumulator space (20) and an
electronic control system responsive to the signal provided by said

pressure sensor for controlling the operation of said throttle valve thereby
to control the amount of fuel delivered by the high pressure pump to the

accumulator space.
