A process for removing printing inks from printed 
wastepaper in the presence of a deinking chemical, in 

which printed wastepaper is disintegrated to form a paper 
stock suspension and the detached printing ink particles 

are removed in known manner by flotation or washing in 
another stage, 
characterized in that
 alkoxylates of blown 
oils are used as the deinking chemical. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the deinking chemical is added during disintegration 

and/or before the flotation or washing step. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that printed wastepaper is disintegrated in the presence 

of 0.02 to 2% by weight and preferably 0.1 to 0.8% by 
weight, based on air-dry paper stock, of alkoxylates of 

blown oils. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the oxyalkylene component makes up from 20 to 95% by 

weight and preferably from 50 to 80% by weight of the 
alkoxylates of blown oils. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that ethoxylates, propoxylates and/or butoxylates, 

preferably ethoxylates and/or propoxylates of blown oils, 
are used for disintegrating the printed wastepaper. 
The use of alkoxylates of blown oils for removing 
printing inks from printed wastepaper. 
The use claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the oxyalkylene component makes up from 20 to 95% by 

weight and preferably from 50 to 80% by weight of the 
alkoxylates of blown oils. 
The use claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
ethoxylates, propoxylates and/or butoxylates, preferably 

ethoxylates and/or propoxylates, of blown oils are used. 
The use claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the alkoxylates of blown oils are used in combination  

 
with compounds selected from the group consisting of C₁₀₋₂₂ 

fatty acids, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts 
thereof and cationic polymers.
