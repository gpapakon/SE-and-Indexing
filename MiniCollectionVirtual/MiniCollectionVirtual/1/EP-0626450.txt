<ABSTRACT>
A novel class of fusion proteins based on the 
ubiquitin carrier protein,or E2, is described. The fusion 

proteins include, in addition to the E2 activity, a 
protein blinding ligand have specific affinity for a 

target protein. It has been discovered that under 
cytosolic conditions, such E2 fusions will add a ubiquitin 

moiety to a target protein. Since ubiquitin addition 
triggers the endogenous cellular protein degradation 

pathway, such E2 fusion proteins can be used to 
selectively target proteins in a host for degradation. 

Thus, E2 fusion proteins genes can be introduced into 
transgenic organisms to defeat or inhibit natural 

activities or traits. The E2 fusion proteins can also be 
used by introduction into hosts for similar effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
molecular biology in general and relates, in particular, 
to a method for creating synthetic nucleotide sequences 
and resulting fusion proteins which are capable of adding 
ubiquitin to selected target proteins and invoking the 
ubiquitin-directed proteolytic process. Living cells are constantly manufacturing proteins 
for metabolic as well as structural purposes within the 
cell. The proteins are manufactured from individual amino 
acids present in the cytoplasm of the cell. At the same 
time, each individual cell is constantly degrading excess 
proteins that are either present in unwanted amounts or 
which are no longer needed at the current stage of the 
cell's development. In general, proteins are constantly 
being degraded into the individual amino acids, which are 
then reconstituted separately into different proteins 
useful for current cellular needs. While the mechanisms for protein synthesis are widely 
understood and studied, the mechanisms for protein 
degradation are not so well characterized. One system in 
which a significant amount of information has been 
developed is the ubiquitin-directed proteolytic pathway. 
This system is illustrated in Figure 1 and will briefly be 
described here. Referring again to Figure 1, beginning on the right  
 
hand side, and indicated at 12, are a plurality of 
ubiquitin proteins. Ubiquitin is a highly conserved 76-amino 
acid protein found in all eukaryotes. The 
conservation of the ubiquitin sequence is so tightly 
conserved that there are only three amino acids which are 
varied amongst all plant and animal ubiquitin proteins yet 
studied. The actual three dimensional shape of the native 
ubiquitin molecule thus resembles the shape illustrated in 
Figure 1, i.e., a ball with a string or tail, composed of 
the carboxyl terminal 5 amino acids, is attached thereto. 
In the ubiquitin-directed metabolic pathway, ubiquitin is 
covalently attached to proteins to be degraded to "tag" 
them for proteolysis. This process begins when free 
ubiquitin in the cell associates with a protein known as 
the E1 or ubiquitin activating enzyme. AMP is attached to 
the carboxyl terminus of the ubiquitin protein in an 
energy consumptive reaction and then, as indicated at 14, 
the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin is attached through a 
thiol ester linkage to a cysteine group on the E1 
molecule. Then a second enzymatic protein associated with 
the cascade, E2, also known both as ubiquitin conjugating 
enzyme (UBC) or ubiquitin
