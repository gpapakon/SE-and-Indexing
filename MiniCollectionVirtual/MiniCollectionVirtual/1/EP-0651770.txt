<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIHEMOPHILIC FACTOR STABILIZATIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION:This invention relates to a method of recovering a purified and stabilized protein having antihemophilic factor activity (AHF or Factor VIII) from a biological sample containing Factor VIII, at least one destabilizing protease impurity, and optionally one or more proprotease impurity. The biological sample is contacted with at least one prote¬ ase removing and/or inhibiting agent to remove or to inhibit destabilizing factor(s) in the sample. The stabilization method may be used in conjunction with any of the commonly used fractionation methods to increase yields and resolution of antihemophilic Factor VIII (VIII:c) resulting in higher recovery of stable, moderate or high purity antihemophilic factor concentrates for clinical use.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:The process of blood clotting begins with an injury to a blood vessel. The damaged vessel wall initiates hemostasis by causing adherence and accumulation of plate¬ lets at the point of vascular injury and by activating the plasma proteins which initiate the coagulation process. Sequential activation, via specific proteolytic cleavages and conformational changes, of a series of proteins (includ- ing Factor VIII) initiate a coagulation cascade that eventu¬ ally leads to deposition of insoluble fibrin. The fibrin, together with aggregated platelets, curtails the escape of blood through the point of injury in the damaged vessel wall. 

 One of these coagulant proteins, Factor VIII, is a plasma protein that has the ability to correct the clotting defect in plasma from patients with Hemophilia A. The activity of Factor VIII is also measured by its ability to induce clotting in plasma obtained from these patients. One unit of Factor VIII is defined as the amount of Factor VIII present in one milliliter of normal, adult male plasma. This standard is a World Health Organization standard and is available from the National Institute for Biological Stan- dards and Control, Holly Hill, Hampstead, London NY3 6RD, England.During normal blood coagulation, Factor VIII is activated by thrombin, a protease, which affects a proteo- lytic modification (cleavage) of Factor VIII.
