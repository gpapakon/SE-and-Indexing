<CLAIMS>
Dental X-ray diagnostic device, containing an X-ray 
source (1), a CCD image detector (7) arranged 

diametrically thereto and in the radiation direction 
towards the object (3) to be penetrated by radiation, 

control electronics (9) with a control part (10) to 
activate the image detector (7) and an image processing 

unit (11), which prepares the signals obtained by the 
image detector (7) and supplies them to an image 

display unit (14), and an operating device (6), with 
which the X-ray source (1) can be switched on and off, 

characterized in that when the X-ray source (1) is 
switched off, the CCD image detector (7) is read out 

continuously by means of a clock generator (10), 
whereby the arriving image data are constantly 

subjected to a threshold-value examination, in that 
when the X-ray source (1) is switched off, the image 

detector is operated in the readout mode, and in that 
with the presence of radiation and upon the exceeding 

of a defined threshold value the clock generator (10) 
and the image detector (7) are switched into the 

location mode.
