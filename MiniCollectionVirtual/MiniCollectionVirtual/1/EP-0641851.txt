<ABSTRACT>
A tubular furnace of such an arrangement that, while a fluid 
to be heated can be prevented from coking or a heating pipe can be 

prevented from burning, a predetermined quantity of heat is provided 
through a smaller heat transfer area and problems of corrosion 

at low temperature of the heating pipe in the tubular furnace 
due to sulfur contents in the fuel are solved, to thereby achieve a 

high efficiency. In this tubular furnace (1), a coil path (3) is divided 
into a plurality of zones (2, ..., 2); at least one heat accumulator type 

burner system (4) is provided in each of the zones (2, ..., 2) for alternately 
performing the supply of combustion air to burners (5, 6) 

through heat accumulators (7, 7) and the discharge of combustion 
gas therefrom; a combustion quantity is independently controlled in 

each of the zones (2, ..., 2), so that a desirable heat flux pattern can 
be formed such that a boundary layer temperature of the fluid to be 

heated in the zones (2, ..., 2) of the coil path (3) is lower than a coking 
temperature or lower than an allowable maximum temperature 

to be determined by the material for use in the heating pipe, and is 
set substantially the same in all of the zones. With this arrangement, 

the heat flux is increased at the inlet zone where the temperature is 
well below a coking temperature, while coking is prevented; a 

predetermined quantity of heat is provided through a smaller heat 
transfer area; the temperature of the tubular wall at the inlet zone is 

raised to avoid the corrosion at low temperature; the waste heat of 
the waste combustion gas is utilized to preheat the combustion air so 

as to achieve a thermal efficiency as high as that in a furnace provided 
with a convection section, even without a convection section, 

so that it becomes possible to render the furnace compact in size or to increase the treating quantity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tubular furnace and
method of controlling combustion of the tubular furnace.Tubular furnaces are primarily used in oil refining and
designed to burn fuel in a combustion chamber comprising a
casing made of steel plates, the inner side of which is lined
with refractory and heat insulating material, and to heat
petroleum or other oil flowing in heating tubes (steel tubes)
arranged within the combustion chamber by using generated
heat.Such a tubular furnace has an important problem of
coking. The term "coking" means a phenomenon that a fluid to
be heated is decomposed and altered into cokes, and taking
steps to prevent coking is considered to be an important issue
from the standpoints of design and operation in tubular
furnaces which primarily handle hydrocarbon.As steps to prevent coking, therefore, it has
conventionally been practiced to select the value of heat flux
such that a boundary layer temperature is held lower than a
coking temperature, and to select a dimension of a tube
diameter such that the flow velocity in the tube is held in an 
appropriate range. From this point, ordinary values of a heat
flux and a flow velocity are specified in furnaces for heating
residual oil that is highly likely to cause coking, such as
furnaces heating raw material for atmospheric distillation
apparatus or vacuum distillation apparatus, for example,Meanwhile, from the viewpoint of energy conservation, a
conventional tubular furnace is arranged as shown in Fig. 4,
for example, such that a convection heat transfer section 102,
in which a fluid to be heated is primarily heated by
convection heat transfer, is provided in an upper part of a
furnace 101, a radiant heat transfer section 103, in which the
fluid is primarily heated by radiant heat transfer, is
provided in a lower part of the furnace 101, and combustion
gas generated by a burner combustion equipment 104 at the
bottom section of the furnace 101 is exhausted through an
exhauster 105 at the top of the furnace 101. A coil path in
this furnace 101 is formed by connecting together the groups
of heating tubes 106 arranged in the furnace into one unit of
heating tube via U-shaped connecting tubes (not shown). The
coil path has an inlet 107 located near the top of the furnace
101 in the convection heat transfer section 102 and an outlet
108 located near the bottom of the furnace 101 in the radiant
heat transfer section 103. Therefore, the fluid to be heated,
which is introduced into the heating tubes 106 from the inlet
107, is
