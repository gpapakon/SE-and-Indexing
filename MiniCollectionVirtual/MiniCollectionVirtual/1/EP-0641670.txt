<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording method. For many years printing proceeds with letterpress, gravure 
(intaglio) or planographic (lithographic) printing machines wherein 
a printing ink receptor, usually paper, makes direct contact with an 
inked printing form [ref. e.g. Printing Technology by J. Michael 
Adams et al. - Delmar Publishers Inc. (1988)]. Nowadays other printing processes, so-called non-impact printing 
processes have found application, e.g. electrostatographic printing, 
and ink jet printing (ref. e.g. "Principles of Non-Impact Printing" 
by Jerome L. Johnson (1986) - Palatino Press - Irvine CA, 92715 
U.S.A.). In ink-jet technology, tiny drops of ink fluid are projected 
directly onto an ink-receptor surface. The placement of each drop 
on the printing substrate is controlled electronically. Printing is 
accomplished by moving the printing head across an ink-receptor 
member (sheet or web) or vice versa. A survey of different ink jet printing systems is given e.g. in 
the already mentioned book "Principles of Non-Impact Printing" and 
in "Imaging and Information Storage Technology" Edited by Wolfgang 
Gerhartz, Weinheim - New York - Basel - Cambridge (1992). Ink jet printing systems may be classified into two groups 
according to whether the ink drops are deflected or not. In continuous ink jet printing a stream of ink droplets is 
modulated by deflection forces (e.g. electrostatic forces after 
charging the ink droplets) to deposit the ink image-wise on an ink-receptor 
element (see e.g US-P 4,901,088). In a particular continuous ink jet printing system ink is 
sprayed under pressure through a tiny glass nozzle about 10 microns 
in diameter. Although the ink emerges in a continuous stream 
traveling at about 60 meters per second, it quickly breaks into 
droplets under the influence of surface tension. Piezoelectric 
vibration in the megahertz range applied to the wall of the glass 
channel conducting the ink induces the formation of about one 
million droplets per second each drop having a diameter of about 30 microns.  
 In impulse ink jet printing ink, also called drop-on-demand ink 
jet printing, droplets are produced pulsewise and travel to the 
receptor material normally without further modification of their 
path. According to one embodiment impulse droplet formation is based 
on electro-mechanical (piezo-electric) displacement of ink through a 
nozzle (see e.g. US-P 4,879,568 and 4,887,100 and EP-A 0 339 926 and 
0 340 960). According to another embodiment the
