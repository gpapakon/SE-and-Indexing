<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the inspection methods used in the
manufacturing of integrated circuit modules, and relates
particularly to a method of inspecting the array of balls
used for outside connections in an integrated circuit module
in order to determine if the inspected module meets the
manufacturing specifications.In many integrated circuit modules and in particular SBC
(Solder Ball Connection) modules, balls replace the
conventional connection pins. The substrate generally
includes a plurality of circuitry layers which connect the
chips together and to the balls utilized as inputs/outputs.
Then, such modules are soldered on printed circuit board by
means of a matrix of conductive pads.The overall reliability of the bonds created by the soldered
ball process is adversely affected by defective balls. For
example, if a ball has an insufficient height, then no
electrical connection is made between the ball and the
corresponding pad of the circuit board.In the past, there have been proposed various kinds of
bonding inspection machines. Thus, US patent 4,688,939
describes an inspection machine of solder bumps by placing
the chip carrier on a platform beneath a ring light which is
in registration with a television camera. Light which is
directed at an angle towards all sides of the chip carrier is
only reflected upwardly into the camera by the solder bumps.
The output signal of the camera which varies with the
intensity of the light reflected from the bumps, is processed
by a vision system to obtain a one-dimensional intensity plot
of the light intensity. The one-dimensional plot is analysed 
automatically by the system to detect for missing or excessive solder bumps on
the chip carrier.Likewise, US patent 5,058,178 relates to an apparatus wherein defective or
missing solder bumps of a chip carrier are detected by first illuminating the carrier
with dark field illumination. Next, the image of the surface is captured by a
television camera. The captured image is processed to detect defects by first
creating a window in the image about each group of solder bumps and then
creating a bounding box about each bump in each window. Each of a set of
attributes including the number, size and location of the windows, the size
location and number of boxes in each window, and the dimensions shape and
brightness of the image in each box, is measured. The value of each attribute is
compared to a reference value representing the value of the attribute when no
defects are present. If the attribute differs by more than a
