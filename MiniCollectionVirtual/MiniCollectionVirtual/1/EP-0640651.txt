<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of filled plastic mouldings based on polyalkyl methacrylate having a granite effect in a shaping polymerisation chamber under the conditions of free-radical polymerisation, where metal-coloured, platelet-shaped phyllosilicates SSK in particle form having a particle size in the region from 20 to 500  mu m are distributed in a casting resin suspension comprising     A) 20 - 80 parts by weight of a liquid PMMA polymer precursor,   B) 0 - 75 parts by weight of a non-metallized, particulate filler, C) 0 - 5 parts by weight, based on the sum of A) and B), of a polymerisable organosilicon compound and   D) 0 - 2 parts by weight of one or more pigments or colorants, in proportions of from 1 to 35 parts by weight, based on the sum of A) and B), the free-radical polymerisation is carried out to completion, and the moulding is subsequently demoulded.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing filled, plastic, moulded 
articles based on polyalkylmethacrylate with granite 

effect, in a moulding polymerisation chamber, under 
free-radical polymerisation conditions, characterised in 

that metal-coloured, plate-like laminated silicates SSK 
in the form of particles within the particle size range 

of between 20 and 500 Âµm, in amounts of 1 to 35 parts by 
weight based on the sum of A) and B), are distributed in 

a cast resin suspension comprising 

A) 20 to 80 parts by weight of a liquid PMMA polymer 
precursor 
B) 0 to 75 parts by weight of a non-metallised, 
particle-like filler 
C) 0 to 5 parts by weight based on the sum of A) and 
B) of a polymerisable organosilicon compound 
D) 0 to 2 parts by weight of one or more pigments or 
dyestuffs, 
 
the free-radical polymerisation is carried out to 

completion and the article is finally removed from the 
mould. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the non-metallised, particle-like filler according 

to B) is used in amounts of 40 to 75 parts by weight. 
A process according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the non-metallised, particle-like filler according 

to B) is crystobalite.
