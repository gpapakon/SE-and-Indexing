<ABSTRACT>
Dimethylchlorosilane and a triorganochlorosilane 
of the formula: R¹R²R³SiCl wherein 

R¹, R², and R³ are independently selected from 
monovalent hydrocarbon groups are concurrently 

prepared by reacting dimethyldichlorosilane with 
a SiH bond-containing silane compound of the 

formula: R¹R²R³SiH in the presence of a Lewis acid 
catalyst. The method is especially effective 

for concomitant preparation of dimethylchlorosilane 
and trimethylchlorosilane or t-butyldimethylchloros
ilane 
in an inexpensive, simple, 

safe manner and in high yields.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to methods for preparing
dimethylchlorosilane and triorganochlorosilanes.Dimethylchlorosilane is a monomeric source
material playing an important role in the
silicone industry. For example, it is used as a
starting material for preparing silicone fluids
and silicone resins having a Si-H bond at one
end or in a backbone thereof. It is also used
as an intermediate in the synthesis of organic
silicon compounds such as silylating agents.On the other hand, triorganochlorosilanes,
for example, trimethylchlorosilane and
derivatives thereof are not only used in a wide
range of application as silylating agents, but
also effective for treating inorganic materials
to be hydrophobic and introducing a terminal 
block unit into an organopolysiloxane chain.
Also t-butyldimethylchlorosilane is important
as a silylating agent for the synthesis of
medicines such as antibiotics and other organic
compounds.Several methods are known in the prior art
for the preparation of dimethylchlorosilane.
For example, when dimethyldichlorosilane is
prepared by a direct process, by-products are
obtained along with hydrocarbons in a low-boiling
component. Dimethylchlorosilane is
isolated from the by-products by distillation.
This process has the drawback that dimethylchlorosilane
is obtained only in a small yield
despite a relatively long process time.
Alternatively, dimethylchlorosilane is prepared
by starting with tetramethyldisiloxane. Since
tetramethyldisiloxane is prepared by cracking an
oil containing a Si-H bond, the overall process
is time consuming and entails the risk of
cleavage of a Si-H bond during cracking.It is reported in Kogyo Kagaku Zassi
(Journal of Industrial Science), 60, 1395 (1957)
to synthesize dimethylchlorosilane by reacting
pentamethylchlorodisilane with dry hydrogen 
chloride at high temperature. Chem. Comm., 507
(1970) reports another synthesis route involving
passing hydrogen chloride through polydimethylsilane
under exposure of UV radiation to thereby
react polydimethylsilane with hydrogen chloride.
These methods use expensive reactants and are
not generally acceptable in the industry.JP-A 53-95922 discloses a method for
preparing a dialkylmonochlorosilane by reducing
a dialkyldichlorosilane with sodium borohydride
and optionally sodium hydride in
N,N,N',N',N'',N''-hexamethylphosphortriamide.
However, since N,N,N',N',N'',N''-hexamethylphosphortriamide
was recently found strongly
carcinogenic, this method was commercially
prohibited from use.A still further method is reduction of
