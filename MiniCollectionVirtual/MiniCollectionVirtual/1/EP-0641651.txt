<ABSTRACT>
A sheet reversing apparatus for a sheet-fed 
rotary press with a reversing mechanism includes a paper 

convey cylinder (65), gaps, a reversing mechanism, a paper 
trailing end holding member, a moving unit, and a 

pivoting unit. The moving unit performs a moving 
operation of the paper trailing end holding member (129) which 

projects or retreats along an arc with respect to the 
outer surface of the paper convey cylinder (65) in accordance 

with a pivotal movement of the paper convey cylinder. 
The pivoting unit performs a pivoting operation of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet 
reversing apparatus for a sheet-fed rotary press with a 
reversing mechanism, which has upstream and downstream 
cylinders with respect to a paper convey direction and a 
paper convey cylinder disposed therebetween to be in 
contact with each other and reverses a paper sheet upon 
gripping and conveyance of the paper sheet between these 
cylinders, thereby performing perfecting printing. Various sheet-fed rotary presses with 
reversing mechanisms each capable of performing 
single-sided printing and perfecting printing have been 
proposed and put into practice along with a variety of 
printing techniques. An example of such a rotary press 
is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,343,241. This rotary 
press has double-diameter impression cylinders on the 
upstream and downstream with respect to a paper convey 
direction and a reversing cylinder disposed therebetween 
to serve as a double-diameter paper convey cylinder. 
This apparatus will be described below. Fig. 18 shows a cylinder arrangement in the 
sheet-fed rotary press with a reversing mechanism,  
 
disclosed in this prior art. Fig. 19 shows a portion 
near a contact point between the upstream impression 
cylinder and the reversing cylinder in a state wherein 
the cylinders are slightly rotated from the state shown 
in Fig. 18. Referring to Figs. 18 and 19, in each of 
adjacent printing cylinders, i.e., in each of first and 
second printing units 1 and 2, a plate cylinder 3 having 
a plate mounted thereon and a blanket cylinder 4 having 
a blanket wound thereon are arranged to be pressed 
against each other. A double-diameter impression 
cylinder 5 as an upstream cylinder with respect to the 
paper convey direction is pressed against the blanket 
cylinder 4 of the printing unit 1. A double-diameter impression cylinder 6 as a 
downstream cylinder with respect to the paper convey 
direction is pressed against the blanket cylinder 4 of 
the printing unit 2. A double-diameter reversing 
cylinder 7 is arranged between the impression cylinders 
5 and 6 to be in contact with each other. A plurality of sets of gripper units 8 each 
having grippers and gripper pads are aligned along the 
axial direction of the impression cylinder 5 at 
positions which divide the circumference of the 
impression cylinder 5 into halves. Similarly, a 
plurality of sets of gripper units 9 are aligned along 
the axial direction of the impression cylinder 6 at  
 
positions which divide the circumference of the 
impression cylinder 6 into

A sheet reversing apparatus for a sheet-fed rotary 
press with a reversing mechanism, comprising: 


a paper convey cylinder (65) disposed between an upstream 
cylinder (63) and a downstream cylinder (64) with respect to 

a paper convey direction to be in contact with each other; 
a gap (65a) formed along an axial direction of said paper 
convey cylinder; 
a reversing mechanism (100,129), disposed in said gap, 
for reversing a paper sheet passing through a contact point 

between said paper convey cylinder and said upstream cylinder 
and wound on said upstream cylinder and transferring said 

paper sheet to said downstream cylinder, said reversing 
mechanism having a paper trailing end holding member (129) for 

holding a trailing end of said paper sheet wound on said 
upstream cylinder to reverse said paper shee
t; 
a driving mechanism (111-113, 116, 121, 125, 126) for 
driving said paper trailing end holding member so as to move 

along an arc with respect to said outer surface of said paper 
convey cylinder and which projects from and retracts into said 

outer surface of said paper convey cylinder in accordance with 
pivotal movement of said paper convey cylinder; and 
a pivoting unit (127) for performing a pivoting operation 
of said paper trailing end holding member in accordance with 

a movement of said paper trailing end holding member, 
 
   said reversing mechanism has a reversing gripper unit 

(81, 92, 100), disposed near said paper trailing end holding 
member in said gap, for gripping said paper sheet held by said 

paper trailing end holding member, and said paper trailing end 
holding member is moved on said circumference of said paper 

convey cylinder to go over said reversing gripper unit in a 
pivotal direction of said paper convey cylinder in accordance 

with the pivotal movement of said paper convey cylinder,
 
   and wherein
 
   said paper trailing end holding member (129) is disposed 

behind said gripper unit (81, 92, 100), in the direction of  
 

movement of said paper convey cylinder, to hold the trailing 
end of a paper sheet when at the contact point between the 

paper convey cylinder and the upstream cylinder; said paper 
trailing end holding member, on further movement of said paper 

convey cylinder, approaches said gripper unit from behind to 
make said gripper unit grip the paper sheet; said paper 

trailing end holding member, on further rotation of said paper 
convey cylinder, retracts within the outer periphery of said 

paper convey cylinder as it moves to the front of said gripper 
unit so as to pass the contact point between the paper convey 

cylinder and said downstream cylinder; and said paper trailing 
end holding member, on further movement of said paper convey 

cylinder and before reaching the contact point between said 
paper convey cylinder and said upstream cylinder, retracts 

into said paper convey cylinder as it passes said gripper unit 
to a position behind said gripper unit. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said 
paper trailing end holding member performs a holding operation 

of said trailing end of said paper sheet when said trailing 
end of said paper sheet reaches a contact point between said 

paper convey cylinder and said downstream cylinder, and at the 
same time, said moving unit and said pivoting unit start the 

moving operation and the pivoting operation of said paper 
trailing end holding member. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said 
paper trailing end holding member is provided to a support 

shaft (128) pivotally supported at two ends, and said moving 
unit is constituted by a cam mechanism (112, 113) operated in 

accordance with the pivotal movement of said paper convey 
cylinder, a pair of drive levers (116, 121), swung in 

accordance with an operation of said cam mechanism, for 
supporting said support shaft at free end portions, an 

arcuated segment gear (125) having an arc smaller than said 
circumference of said paper convey cylinder, and an 

intermediate gear (126) pivotally mounted at said free end  
 

portion of each of said drive levers and engaged with said 
segment gear. 
An apparatus according to Claim 3, wherein said 
pivoting unit is constituted by a drive gear (127) fixed to 

said support shaft and meshed with said intermediate gear to 
pivot said support shaft. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said 
paper trailing end holding member is constituted by a 

plurality of suckers for drawing and holding said trailing end 
of said paper sheet, said suckers being aligned in said gap 

along the axial direction of said paper convey cylinder at a 
predetermined interval. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said 
paper trailing and holding member is rotated on said
