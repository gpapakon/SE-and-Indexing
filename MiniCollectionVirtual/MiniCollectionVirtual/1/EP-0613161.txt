<CLAIMS>
Keyboard having a multiplicity of key plungers 
which can be moved resiliently in guide domes (1, 2) on 

a housing top part and are connected to key caps (11) 
engaging over the guide domes, at least one key cap (11), 

the key plunger of which is assigned to a guide dome (1, 
2), being enlarged in
 such a way that it covers two guide 
domes (1, 2) as a double key, characterized in that a 

guide element (10) in the form of a pin is fastened to 
the key cap (11) of the double key, which guide element 

(10) descends into the space between two guide domes (1, 
2) and is guided both on the two guide domes and in a 

mating element, provided between the two guide domes, on 
the housing top part (3). 
Keyboard according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that lug-like supporting means (12), which project 

laterally in the direction of the two guide domes (1, 2) 
and each engage in guide grooves (9) in the two guide 

domes (1, 2), are provided on the guide element (10) in 
the form of a pin. 
Keyboard according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the mating element provided on the housing top 

part (3) is composed of a hole-like recess (4), which is 
framed partly by the mutually facing side surfaces of the 

two guide domes (1, 2) and partly by transverse walls (5, 
6) which are perpendicular with respect thereto. 
Keyboard according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that sliding webs (7, 8) are provided in each case on the 

side surfaces of the guide domes (1, 2), on the 
transverse walls (5, 6) of the recess (4) and/or on the  

 
guide element (10) in the form of a pin. 
Keyboard according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the guide element (10) is 

designed as a rectangular hollow profile. 
Keyboard according to one of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the lug-like supporting elements 

(12) together with the rectangular hollow profile form 
the shape of a double T. 
Keyboard according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the guide element in the 

form of a pin is composed of a material which slides 
well.
