<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a stable homogeneous emulsifier-free suspension of at least one hydrophobic substance and/or a substance whereof the melting point is higher than about 130  DEG C, and a thickening agent, in an aqueous medium. Said suspensions can be used in food compositions, in particular based on milk and milk derivatives.

concentration that the concentration in the viscous solution is 0.1% to 30% p/v

   to obtain a stable homogeneous emulsifier free suspension.

a stable homogeneous suspension is prepared by mixing an aqueous solution, a

thickener,
the stable homogeneous suspension is mixed with a liquid composition the
water content of which is at least 60% and contains no more than 18% fat, at a

temperature of 60°C to 80°C,
the mixture obtained at the preceding stage is subjected to homogenisation
under pressure of 50 to 500 bars to obtain a stable homogenised dispersion in which the

particles making up the substance, hydrophobic and/or the melting point of which is
