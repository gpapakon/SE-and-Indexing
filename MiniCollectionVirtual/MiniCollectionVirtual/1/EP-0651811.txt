the sequence SEQ ID No. 1, the said part possessing a

transcriptional promoter activity.
Recombinant DNA comprising a DNA
sequence according to Claim 1.
Recombinant DNA according to Claim 2,

characterized in that
 it contains, in addition, one or
more structural genes.
Recombinant DNA according to Claim 3,

characterized in that
 it also contains signals
permitting the secretion of the product of expression

of the said structural gene(s).
Recombinant DNA according to Claims 3
and 4, 
characterized in that
 the structural gene(s)

food industry.
Recombinant DNA according to Claim 5,

characterized in that
 the structural gene(s) encode
proteins chosen from enzymes (such as, in particular,

superoxide dismutase, catalase, amylases, lipases,
amidases, chymosin, and the like), blood derivatives

(such as serum albumin, alpha- or beta-globin, factor
VIII, factor IX, von Willebrand's factor, fibronectin,

alpha

PDGF, TGF, and the like), apolipoproteins, antigenic 
polypeptides for the production of vaccines (hepatitis,

cytomegalovirus, Eppstein-Barr, herpes, and the like),
or alternatively fusions of polypeptides such as, in

particular, fusions containing an active portion fused
to a stabilizing portion (e.g. fusions between albumin

or albumin fragments and the virus receptor or a
portion of a virus receptor [CD4, and the like]
).
Recombinant DNA according to any one of
Claims 2 to 6, 
characterized in that
 it forms part of
an expression plasmid, which can be autonomously

replicating or integrative.

portion fused to a stabilizing portion (e.g. fusions

between albumin or albumin fragments and the virus
receptor or a portion of a virus receptor [CD4, and the

like]).
