<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the suppression
of "glitches" ,i.e., those unwanted variations in control
signals which result from contact bounce, interference of
various types and/or noise.Low voltage control signals are applied to semiconductor
devices for myriad reasons, and an unwanted
variation in such control signals often has serious
adverse effects on the operation of the circuit. It is
known to suppress these temporary variations by requiring
that any change in the control signal appear for a predetermined
finite period of time before it is recognized
as a desired control signal and not as an undesired
transient. By way of example, the specification of U.S.
Patent No. 4,525,635 discloses the use of two bistable
devices as a transient suppression circuit, with the two
bistable devices used to sample the control signal at two
different times and concurrence of the bistable devices
required for propagation of the control signal into the
circuit. In this way, the binary state of the control
signal must remain constant over the two samples for the
signal to be recognized as a control signal, and the
glitch suppression circuit acts as a filter for transients
having less duration than the two samples.However, there are times when it is desired to
bypass the glitch suppression circuit and to propagate the 
control signal directly into the circuit. Accordingly, an
object of the present invention is to provide a novel
circuit and method for selectively bypassing a glitch
suppression circuit.Another object is to provide a novel selectively bypassable
glitch suppression circuit which can be integrated into the
control lines for an operating circuit.A further object is to provide a novel selectively operable
transient filter circuit and method.Yet another object is to provide a novel circuit and method
which may be integrated into the design of a semiconductor
device without regard to the desirability of the glitch
suppression circuit in the application of the integrated
circuitStill another object is to provide a novel integrated
circuit and method which contains a glitch suppression
circuit in every input line and thus avoids any additional
constraint from either temperature or process parameters on
the operating circuit.The invention is defined in Claim 1. The preamble portion of this Claim corresponds to the prior art disclosed in EP-A-0 394 861. The invention will now be described, by way of example,
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:Figure 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of a

<CLAIMS>
A glitch suppression circuit comprising a first bistable
device for receiving a control signal to provide a

first output signal related to the state thereof at a time
T2, a second bistable device for receiving said first

output signal and to provide a second output signal related
to the state of said first output signal at a time T1, a

third bistable device, means for applying successive clock
cycles to said first, second and third bistable devices,

means to provide a third output signal for application to
said third bistable device when the state of said first and

second output signals changes between the times T1 and T2,
reset means, operable independently of the state of said

control signal for setting said first, second and third
bistable devices to a predetermined state so that the state

of the control signal when sampled during each clock cycle
may be propagated therethrough, characterized in that one

or more operating circuits each have one or more control
signal lines, the glitch suppression circuit being located

in each of said control lines, each of said glitch suppression
circuits including bypass means and a bypass

control line for selectively bypassing the glitch suppression
function in response to the application of a signal to

the control line thereof.
A circuit as claimed in claim 1, characterised by a
control signal applied to the first of a plurality of

series connected bistable devices logically connected
together to provide an output signal only when the state of

the control signal remains unchanged for a number of clock
cycles equal to the number of series connected bistable

devices, the method of selectively bypassing the function
of the circuit comprising the steps of selectively resetting

each of the bistable devices during each of the clock 
cycles whereby the output signal from the last of the

binary devices during successive clock cycles represents
the state of the control signal during successive clock

cycles.
A circuit as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that
said glitch suppression circuit includes three or more

resettable bistable devices.
