<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for rapidly changing the temperature of a 
semiconductor wafer, in order to perform electrical tests or stress at elevated 

temperature, and then cool rapidly to ambient temperature. The apparatus is 
comprised of a wafer support (
17
), capable of supporting the 
wafer,mounted on top of a rapid thermal processing (RTP) illuminator 

(
20
) (lamps, preferably halogen), and including one or more 
probe needles (
22
), capable of contacting the 
wafer to perform electrical measurements. A semiconductor wafer 

(
16
) is placed 
upon the wafer support 

(
17
) and the RTP illuminator (
20
) located beneath is 
activated, rapidly elevating the wafer to the desired temperature. Electrical 

tests may be performed as desired during the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to semiconductor device electrical testing 
and more particularly to apparatus for performing electrical testing on 
semiconductor devices at various temperatures including elevated temperatures 
in wafer form. In semiconductor technology, electronic devices and circuits are made on 
one semiconductor wafer. They each have various components on them; these 
components may include transistors, resistors, capacitors, and others. After the 
circuit has been fabricated, individual components or circuit modules in selected 
circuits can be probe tested to determine the electrical characteristics of the 
various components. In the development phase of semiconductors, characteristic 
tests over a wide temperature range are typically performed in order to test 
device reliability and performance under temperature stress. Other 
temperature-dependant tests are performed during production in order to 
monitor the quantities or presence of certain elements such as mobile ion 
contaminants that may be introduced during the processing of the material. Patent number 4,567,432 entitled "Apparatus for Testing Integrated 
Circuits" filed on Jun. 9, 1983 by Buol et al describes a system for testing an 
integrated circuit die in wafer form at various temperatures. The system 
involves a resistively-heated wafer chuck which includes a means for heating 
and/or cooling the wafer via an electrical heating element and refrigerant gas.  While nothing in prior art suggests or teaches the use of a Rapid Thermal 
Processing chuck or susceptor for probe testing of semiconductors, or the use of 
such a chuck in or with a probed test fixture, several patents have been issued 
for the production of semiconductors using Rapid Thermal Processing. One such 
patent is U.S. Patent 4,891,499 filed Sep. 9, 1988 by Moslehi, entitled "Method 
and Apparatus for Real-time Wafer Temperature Uniformity Control and Slip-Free 
Heating on Lamp Heated Single-wafer Rapid Thermal Processing 
Systems". Another such patent is U.S. Patent 4,830,700 filed Apr. 27, 1988 by 
Davis et al entitled "Processing Apparatus and Method" wherein the processing 
apparatus also utilizes Rapid Thermal Processing. In these Rapid Thermal 
Processing (RTP) patents the semiconductor wafer is placed either device side 
down or device side up in a vacuum or atmospheric chamber prior to the 
processing stages at relatively high temperatures. The present invention will be described with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, wherein:
