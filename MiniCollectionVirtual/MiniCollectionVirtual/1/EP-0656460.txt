<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns methods and installations for
monitoring a reservoir of fluids such as hydrocarbons located in
subsurface formations traversed by at least one well. The invention
also relates to devices suitable for the implementation of such
methods.During the production of fluids such as hydrocarbons and/or
gas from an underground reservoir, it is important to determine the
development and behavior of the reservoir, firstly to allow production
to be controlled and optimized and secondly to foresee changes which
will affect the reservoir, in order to take appropriate measures.Methods and devices for determining the behavior of underground
reservoirs, by measuring the pressure of fluids, are known.A first method consists in locating a pressure gauge at the
bottom of a production well and connecting it to the surface by a
cable allowing transmission of information between the gauge and the
surface.That known method suffers from problems. In the first place,
the pressure gauge located at the bottom of the well and its associated
devices are very costly; for example it may happen that the cost
comes to the same order as that of the production well itself.
Moreover the pressure gauge in such a position at the bottom of the
well only allows the pressure in the well to be measured, in the
course of production.In a second known method, called "interference testing",
pressure is measured with the aid of at least two wells spaced from
one another and penetrating the production region which is isolated
above and below, in each of the wells, by plug members known as
"packers". One or more pressure gauges are located in the production
region, in each of the wells. A pressure pulse is then generated in
one of the wells and the variation of pressure with time in the other
well, as a result of this pressure pulse, is measured. 
Although it provides valuable data, that method suffers from problems. It is very costly
because it is necessary to stop production of the well in which the measurement is made and
taking a set of measurements can last several days. That is all the more true insofar as it is
necessary to stop all the wells in a region of measurement. Furthermore that method is only
possible in existing wells and thus requires at least two wells drilled in the same production
region.Finally, those known methods only allow measurements in the production well. It is
thus necessary to carry out interpolations, extrapolations and complex calculations in an
attempt to determine the behavior of the
