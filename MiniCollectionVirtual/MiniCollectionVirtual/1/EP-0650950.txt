<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of methanol, and more specifically to a process 
for the synthesis of methanol from hydrocarbons with a 
fluidized bed catalytic reactor. Methanol is used in large amounts since it is 
almost free from environmental pollution and easy to 
transport, and it is demanded to develop an ultra-large 
scale apparatus capable of producing 5,000 tons/day, 10,000 
tons/day or more of methanol. In recent years, in order to cope with such an 
ultra-large scale apparatus for producing methanol for use 
as a fuel, the development of a fluidized bed catalyst 
reactor is under way. For example, JP-A-60-84142, JP-A-60-122040 
and JP-A-60-106534 (corresponding to U. S. Patent 
4,666,945) disclose methods for the production of fluid 
catalysts for the synthesis of methanol. Further, JP-A-63-211246 
(corresponding to U. S. Patent 4,956,392) discloses 
catalysts and reaction conditions for the synthesis of 
methanol with a fluidized bed. The largest problem in the development of 
the above large-scale apparatus for the production of 
methanol is to increase the capacity of a gas-reforming 
apparatus for the production of a synthetic gas from 
hydrocarbons. A conventional steam-reforming apparatus uses 
the system of externally heating reaction tubes in a 
reforming furnace, and when the capacity of an apparatus 
for the production of methanol is increased, the limit of 
the capacity of the apparatus is 1,500 to 2,000 tons/day.  
 A method using the combination of a steam-reforming 
and a partial oxidation is attracting attention as 
a method of gas reforming with a large-scale apparatus. 
This method is carried out as follows. A hydrocarbon and 
steam are mixed and subjected to a primary reforming 
reaction. Then, oxygen is added, and a partial oxidation 
and a secondary reforming reaction are carried out. The 
resultant gas having a high temperature is used as a heat 
source for the primary reforming reaction. Advantageously, 
this method requires no external supply of heat, nor does it 
require a reforming furnace in which reaction tubes are to 
be externally heated. Therefore, a synthesis gas having a 
high pressure can be obtained, and the synthesis reaction of 
the synthesis gas can be directly carried out without 
increasing the pressure of the synthesis gas with a 
compressor. Thus, the reforming reaction is carried out 
under a high pressure, the capacity of the apparatus 
therefor can be easily increased. U.S. Patents 4,666,680, 5,112,578 and 5,156,821
