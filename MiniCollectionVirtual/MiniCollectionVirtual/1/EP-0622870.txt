<ABSTRACT>
An abutment rib of a first connector portion 
compresses a coil spring, mounted in a second connector 

portion. If the connector is released prior to complete 
and proper electrical connection, the connector portions 

are moved away from each other to visibly and clearly 
indicate an incomplete or inadequate connection. When the 

connector mechanism is properly fitted, retaining 
projections of lock arms positively engage retaining holes 

in a hood portion, thereby maintaining the connector 
portions in a locked and properly fitted, electrically 

connected condition against the bias of the coil spring 
urging the abutment rib. Therefore, only when the 

connectors are properly and completely fitted together, 
and are prevented from withdrawal, is a proper electrical 

connection indicated and achieved. The connector 
mechanism clearly indicates an electrically-connected 

condition, thereby preventing a half-connected condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector, and more
particularly to a connector having a mechanism for
maintaining a fitted condition.With reference to Figure 4, one related art
connector 1 has external threads 2 formed on an outer
peripheral surface of an end portion thereof, and the
other connector 3 has at its outer periphery a rotation
ring 5 having internal threads 4 threadedly engageable
with the external threads 2.The two connectors 1 and 3 are disposed in opposed
relation to each other, and the rotation ring 5 is rotated
to threadedly engage the internal threads 4 with the
external threads 2 so that the connectors 1 and 3 are
moved toward each other and are electrically connected
together. By rotating the rotation ring 5 in the opposite
direction, the connectors 1 and 3 are disengaged from each
other, thereby breaking the electrical connection.In the above conventional connector, the
electrical connection and disconnection are achieved by
rotating the rotation ring 5. However, the electrically-connected
condition cannot be easily verified merely by
rotating the rotation ring 5, and therefore there has been
encountered a problem that a half-connected condition in
which the connection is incomplete can occur.An object of the invention is to provide a
connector of the type in which an electrically-connected
condition can be clearly verified, thus substantially
eliminating a half-connected condition.Another object of the invention is to provide a
positive locking mechanism for connector.Yet another object is to provide a clearly visible
indication of an incomplete or improper electrical
connection.The above objects of the present invention have
been achieved by a connector wherein one of a pair of 
connector portions is inserted into and engaged with the
other connector portion; a spring mechanism urges the two
connector portions away from each other during the
insertion, and a lock mechanism retains the two connector
portions against the action of the spring mechanism when
the two connector portions are moved close to a proper
fitted position.The invention will be described in detail with
reference to the drawings, wherein:
Fig. 1 is a vertical cross-sectional view of one
preferred embodiment of a connector of the present
invention before the fitting is effected;Fig. 2 is a vertical cross-sectional view of the
connector during the fitting operation;Fig. 3 is a vertical cross-sectional view of the
connector in a fitted condition; andFig. 4 is a perspective view of a conventional
connector.One preferred

<CLAIMS>
A connector mechanism for maintaining and indicating
a proper connection comprising:


a first connector portion (10) including a first wall
and a second wall, said first wall and said second wall being

spaced in predetermined relation to define an annular
space (16) therebetween, said first wall including at least

one retaining hole (12b1, 12b2), at least one retaining lug
12c1, 12c2), and at least one notch (12a1, 12a2) and said

second wall including at least one abutment rib 15a); and
a second connector portion (20) having a spring mechanism
and a locking assembly, said locking assembly including

a locking arm having (26), at least one retaining projection
(26a) adapted to cooperate with said at least one

retaining hole (12b1, 12b2) and at least one flexible tab
engageable with said at least one notch (12a1, 12a2);

   wherein:

during assembly of the first connector portion (10)
and the second connector portion (20), said spring mechanism

engages said abutment rib (15a) of said second wall
thereby compressing said spring mechanism, and said locking

assembly is inserted within the annular space (16) of the
first connector portion;
a complete connection position is achieved when the at
least one retaining projection (26a) engages said at least

one retaining hole (12b1, 12b2) and the spring mechanism
being in a locked state in said complete connection position;

and
an incomplete connection position is achieved if the
at least one retaining projection (26a) and the at least

one retaining hole (12b1, 12b2) are not engaged, wherein
said spring mechanism indicates the incomplete connection

by forcing the first connector portion (10) and the second
connector portion (20) to separate.
The connector mechanism according to claim 1,
wherein said spring mechanism includes a spring (28) and an

abutment plate (29), said abutment plate being engageable
with said abutment rib (15a) of said first connector portion

(10).
The connector mechanism according to claim 2,
wherein said abutment plate (29) is slidingly supported by

a base (24) and said spring (28) is a coil spring having a
shape complimentary to said base, said base including a
