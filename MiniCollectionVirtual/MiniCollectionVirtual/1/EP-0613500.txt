<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to nucleic acid segments useful in the construction of expression vectors for expression of heterologous polypeptides directed to particular areas of the host cell. Selected constructs direct production of polypeptides to the outer membrane surface of the cell. Other constructs direct expression of heterologous polypeptides to the inner membrane/periplasm of the host cell. Transformed host cells are potentially useful for the production of vaccines or immunogens elicited in response to antigens expressed on the outer membranes of the host cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTION** MEMBRANE EXPRESSION OF HETEROLOGOUS GENES ϊ<* 5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe invention relates generally to the exportation 10 of heterologous polypeptides to discrete regions of a host cell in which it is expressed, to nucleic acid sequences encoding exportation polypeptides, to the preparation of membrane embedded epitopes of immunogenic antigens, and to vectors constructed with selected 15 exportation sequences. More particularly, localized expression of polypeptides may be obtained by providing exportation signals encoded by segments of the disclosed nucleic acids that provide for exportation of expressed heterologous polypeptides to the inner 20 membrane/periplasmic space or the outer membrane surface of a host cell.Description of Related Art25 Recombinant gene technology has been extensively investigated in the context of expression of foreign proteins in host cells which harbor recombinant genes, typically bacterial host cells. Such expression is desirable for producing high value proteins, immunogenic30 polypeptides, and in obtaining hybrid proteins that are otherwise difficult to synthesize.Of particular interest is vaccine development. It is potentially feasible to prepare protective vaccines 35 from epitopes of known antigens of eukaryotic, viral or prokaryotic pathogens by taking advantage of the synthetic capacities of transformed host cells. Examples 

 include tumor specific proteins which might be expressed and utilized to stimulate an immune response. Oral vaccines have stimulated research because of the ease of administration and, more importantly, in some instances the unsatisfactory protection a orded from parenteral injection. Vaccination against cholera, for example, gives short-term protection, thus provoking developmental work toward an oral vaccine that would presumably stimulate mucosal intestinal immunity more efficiently (Sanchez et al. , 1990).Salmonella strains are being studied experimentally as particularly attractive candidates for producing oral live vaccines. Attenuated strains have been shown to elicit immune responses in several animal species(Strugnell et al. r 1990) and apparently can be highly immunogenic in the host. Humoral antibody responses including local secretory antibody and cellular immune responses have been observed after oral intake (Dougan et al. , 1986). Attenuated mutants have been identified via screening procedures such as Tnp oA mutagenesis, which exclude elimination of mutations in nonsecreted proteins
