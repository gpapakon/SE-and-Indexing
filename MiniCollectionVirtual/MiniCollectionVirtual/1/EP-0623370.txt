<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an interface device between a ski and front and rear bindings 3 and 4 which are intended to hold the ends of a boot on the ski. The device comprises a longitudinal plate 15, each end of which is connected to the ski in front of and behind the bindings 3 and 4. One end 16 of the plate is assembled on the ski in an integral manner. The other end 23 of the plate is movable with respect to the ski, and linking means 24 exert a thrust against a wedge 20, integral with the ski, which prestresses the plate 15 in traction and, by reaction, the upper surface of the ski, in its central zone, in compression. This prestress preferably ceases beyond a specific flexing of the ski.
