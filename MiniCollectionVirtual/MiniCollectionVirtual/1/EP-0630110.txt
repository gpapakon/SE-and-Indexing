<ABSTRACT>
A level conversion circuit converting a digital 
input signal varying between first (VSS) and second (VDD1) 

voltage levels to a digital output signal varying between the 
first (VSS) and a third voltage level (VDD2) is disclosed. It 

includes between first (VDD2) and second (VSS) poles of a DC 
supply source the series connection of a load impedance 

(P2/P3/N3) and the main paths of a first transistor (N2) and 
of a second transistor (N1), to the control electrode of 

which the input signal is applied. The first and second 
transistor are of a same first conductivity type. A third 

transistor (P1) of a second conductivity type is connected in 
parallel with the second transistor (N1). The control 

electrode of the third (P1) and first (N2) transistors are 
biased by a constant DC bias voltage (VBIAS1A/VBIAS1B), and 

the junction point of the load impedance (P2/P3/N3) and the 
series connection constitutes an output terminal (OUT) of the 

level conversion circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a level conversion 
circuit for converting a digital input signal varying between 
first and second voltage levels to a digital output signal 
varying between said first level and a third voltage level, 
and including between first and second poles of a DC supply 
source the series connection of the main paths of a first 
transistor and of a second transistor, to the control 
electrode of which said input signal is applied. Such a level conversion circuit is already known in 
the art, e.g. from the published European patent application 
EP 0 388 074 A1. Therein, the first and second transistors 
are of opposite conductivity type and two further third and 
fourth transistors are coupled between the two DC supply 
poles in a similar way as the first and second transistors 
and in parallel to the series connection of the latter 
transistors. The first and third transistors are of PMOS 
conductivity type, and the second and fourth transistors are 
of NMOS conductivity type. The complement of the input signal 
is applied to the gate electrode of the third transistor. The 
junction point between the third and fourth transistors 
constitutes a true output terminal of the level conversion 
circuit, and the junction point between the first and the 
second transistor constitutes a complemented output terminal. 
The gate electrode of the second transistor is connected to 
the true output terminal, whereas the gate electrode of the 
fourth transistor is connected to the complemented output 
terminal. The voltage provided at the first DC supply pole is 
0 volts and the voltage provided at the second DC supply pole 
is 5 volts. Such a level conversion circuit is for instance 
used to convert a digital input signal varying between 0 
volts and 3.3 volts to a digital output signal varying 
between 0 volts and 5 volts, the digital input signal being 
provided by circuitry operating with a 3.3 volt supply  
 
voltage as is necessary when the conductor line widths are so 
small and the gate oxide layers are so thin that the use of 
e.g. a 5 volts supply voltage would cause problems of metal 
electromigration and hot electron effects, respectively. The 
latter digital signal is then applied to circuitry operating 
with a 5 volt supply voltage. To be noted that the problem of 
metal electromigration is due to the current through the 
conductor, i.e. smaller conductor line widths necessitate 
lower currents and thus lower supply voltages. When the input signal is high, i.e. 3.3 volts, the
