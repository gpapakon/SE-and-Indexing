<ABSTRACT>
Systems and methods for separating a suspension of plasma and platelets from whole blood rotate a chamber (58) about an axis (62) to create within the chamber (58) a low-G zone radially close to the axis (62) and a high-G zone (66) spaced radially further from the axis (62) than the low-G zone (64). The systems and methods introduce whole blood into an inlet region (68) of the chamber (58) to initiate separation of red blood cells toward the high-G zone (66) of the inlet region (68). This creates a strong flow of plasma that moves radially toward the low-G zone (64) of the inlet region (68) and elutes platelets into suspension with it. The systems and methods direct the radial flow of plasma and eluted platelets within the inlet region (68) to a port (72) in the inlet region (68) for transport out of the chamber (58).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a centrifugal 
processing apparatus and method. Today blood collection organizations 
routinely separate whole blood by centrifugation into 
its various therapeutic components, such as red blood 
cells, platelets, and plasma.  
 Conventional blood processing systems and 
methods use durable centrifuge equipment in 
association with single use, sterile processing 
chambers, typically made of plastic. The centrifuge 
equipment introduces whole blood into these chambers 
while rotating them to create a centrifugal field. Whole blood separates within the rotating 
chamber under the influence of the centrifugal field 
into higher density red blood cells and platelet-rich 
plasma. An intermediate layer of white blood cells 
and lymphocytes forms an interface between the red 
blood cells and platelet-rich plasma. In conventional blood separation systems and 
methods, platelets lifted into suspension in the PRP 
can settle back upon the interface. The platelets 
settle, because the radial velocity of the plasma 
undergoing separation is not enough to keep the 
platelets in suspension. Lacking sufficient radial 
flow, the platelets fall back and settle on the 
interface. This reduces processing efficiencies, 
lowering the effective yield of platelets. The invention provides, as set out in claims 1 and 20, an 
improved blood 
processing apparatus and method that create unique 
dynamic flow conditions within the processing chamber. 
These flow conditions continuously free platelets from 
the interface, sweeping them into the platelet-rich 
plasma stream for collection. The dynamic flow 
conditions also serve to maximize exposure of the 
blood components to the centrifugal separation forces, 
further enhancing separation efficiencies. One aspect of the invention provides a 
chamber and associated method for separating whole 
blood into red blood cells and a plasma constituent 
carrying platelets in a rotating field. This aspect  
 
of the invention forms a separation zone between first 
and second spaced apart walls. The separation zone 
includes an entry region, where whole blood enters the 
separation chamber to begin separation. The 
separation zone also includes a terminal region spaced 
from the entry region, where separation is halted. Whole blood is conveyed through the 
separation zone from the entry region toward the 
terminal region. The separation of plasma constituent 
from the red blood cells successively increases the 
blood hematocrit along the flow path. According to this
