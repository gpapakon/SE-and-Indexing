<ABSTRACT>
In order, along with the simple structure and reliable sealing action, to stabilize the position of the sealing elements, it being the intention simultaneously to provide guidance for the pipe ends (1, 2) to be connected, said pipe ends (1, 2) are provided, at their end, with socket-like widenings which are enclosed in a positively locking manner by a clamp (11), which can be reduced in diameter. The clamp (11) extends, at the same time, over cylindrical portions of said widenings and, in this manner, has the effect of aligning the pipe ends (1, 2) with respect to one another. Extending within the pipe connection, spanning said widenings, is a supporting pipe (5), and the end sides of the pipe ends (1, 2) are kept at a distance from one another. Introduced in the annular space between the supporting pipe (5) and the widenings are sealing elements (7) which each exhibit portions (8, 16) which project out of the end sides of the pipe ends and are arranged such that they are braced in the annular space encircled radially by the supporting pipe (5) and clamp (11). The pipe connection according to the invention is distinguished by a high degree of strength with respect to transverse-force loading and by securing by positive locking to prevent the connection being pulled apart.

Pipe connection between two pipe ends (1, 2) which comprise on their ends to 
be connected sleeve-like portions of increased diameter, 


having a clamping ring (11) which is intended for the purpose of encompassing the 
two portions of increased diameter in a form locking manner axially, can be reduced 

in diameter and amongst other things serves to hold the pipe ends (1, 2) together, 
having a supporting pipe (5) which extends within the portions of increased 
diameter and bridges over the latter said portions and 
having sealing elements (7) which are inserted into the annular space between the 
supporting pipe (5) and the portions of increased diameter, 
wherein the end faces of the pipe ends (1, 2) are held at a spaced interval with 
respect to each other, 
wherein the sealing elements (7) each comprise a portion (8, 16) which protrudes 
out of the end faces of the pipe ends and 
wherein the portions (8, 16) are disposed in a clamped manner in the annular 
space which is defined radially by virtue of the supporting pipe (5) and the 

clamping ring (11), 
characterised in that 
the clamping ring (11) comprises cylindrical portions (15) which lie on cylindrical 
portions (3) of the pipe ends (1, 2), and 
the portions (8, 16) of the sealing elements (7) comprise at least partially radial  
 

dimensions which correspond to the dimensions of the annular space between the 
supporting pipe (5) and the clamping ring (11). 
Pipe connection according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that 


each portion of increased diameter of a pipe end (1, 2) consists in a manner 
known per se starting from its region of constant diameter of the series arrangement 

of a cylindrical portion (3) and of a receiving portion (4) which is further increased 
in diameter with respect to this cylindrical portion (3), 
wherein the radial dimensions of the receiving portion (4) in the plane of the end 
face of the pipe end (1, 2) correspond substantially to those of the cylindrical portion 

(3) and 
the clamping ring (11) lies at least on the ends of the receiving portion (4) facing 
a radial middle plane (6) and lies at least on a part of the cylindrical portions (3). 
Pipe connection according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that 
the annular space, which is defined in a radial manner by virtue of the sleeve-like 
portions of increased diameter and the supporting pipe (5), is at least partially filled 

by the respective sealing element (7), 
the supporting pipe (5) extends starting from the commencement of the portion of 
increased diameter of the one pipe end (1) - penetrating the middle plane (6) - in 

a continuous manner to the commencement of the portion of increased diameter of 
the other pipe end (2) and  

 
the clamping ring (14) comprises a middle, cylindrical portion (13) which is 
continued on both sides - by interpositioning transition portions (14) - in cylindrical 

portions (15) of a smaller radius which lie on the respective pipe ends (1, 2). 
Pipe connection according to any one of the preceding claims I to 3, 

characterised in that 
a supporting ring (9) is inserted into the annular space which is defined in an axial 
manner by the end faces of the pipe ends (1, 2) and in a radial manner by the 

supporting pipe (5) and the clamping ring (11), 
the supporting ring (9) lies on the inner side of the clamping ring (11) and on the 
outer side of the supporting pipe (5), 
the supporting ring (9) comprises bearing surfaces which are oriented on both 
sides in an axial manner and tailored geometrically to suit the facing sides of the 

portions (8, 16) of the sealing elements (7), 
the supporting ring (9) comprises a form which is trapezium-shaped in cross 
section and whose relatively larger base side lies on the inner side of the clamping 

ring (11) and 
the portions (8, 16) of the sealing elements (7) have at least partially radial 
dimensions which correspond to the dimensions of the annular space between the 

supporting pipe (5) and the clamping ring (11). 
Pipe connection according to claim 4, characterised in that the pipe ends (1, 2), 
the supporting pipe (5), the clamping ring (11) and the supporting ring (9) consist 

of the same metallic material, for example steel, aluminium or copper.  
 
Pipe connection according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that 


the portions (8, 16) lie directly against to each other at the end face side by way 
of bearing surfaces which are adapted to each other.
