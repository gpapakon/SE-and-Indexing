<ABSTRACT>
A method for recording control for a recording medium (11b) having a data 
recording region (A20) for recording data such as audio data, speech data, and a control 

data region (A10) for recording control data for the data recording region. The method 
includes discriminating a non-silent recorded portion and a silent recorded portion of 

the data recorded in the data recording region based upon the signal level of the data 
recorded in the data recording region (SP12-SP15), and recording control data for 

separating the data recorded in the data recording region into temporally former and 
temporally latter portions at a boundary portion between the non-silent recorded portion 

and the silent recorded portion based upon the results of discrimination after end of 

recording of the data in the data recording region (SP18-SP19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for recording on
a recording medium and a method for controlling the recording.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a recording
apparatus for recording on a recording medium under control based
on the data signal level, and a method for controlling the
recording.An optical disc may be of a recording capacity two to three
digits of magnitude larger than a magneto-optical disc and permits
higher speed access than with a tape-shaped recording medium.
Since the optical disc has such merits that it has high durability
and permits contact-free data recording/reproduction, it is
recently being employed in increasing numbers.Among the optical disc, there are a read-only optical disc
having a read-only area having data recorded as pits, conforming to
a standard CD (Compact Disc) format, referred to hereinafter as a
CD-DA format, a magneto-optical disc, in the form of a
magneto-optical recording medium having a recording/reproducing 
area conforming to a CD-MO format as an extension format of the
CD-DA format, and a hybrid disc having both the read-only area
having data recorded as pits and a recording/reproducing area
having a magneto-optical recording layer in which the data is
recorded on or reproduced from the magneto-optical recording layer.If, in a data recording/reproducing apparatus for recording
data on a disc-shaped recording medium, such as a magneto-optical
disc or a hybrid disc, the recording data become useless data
during recording, the recording is discontinued by a manual
operation. If an air is to be recorded from a CD to a
magneto-optical disc, the recording by the magneto-optical disc
recording/reproducing apparatus is discontinued by a manual
operation after the end of reproduction by the CD player.In a disc-shaped recording medium, such as an optical disc or
a magneto-optical disc, there are provided a main data recording
area for recording main data, such as audio data or speech data or
general data, and a control data recording area for recording
control data.In the data recording/reproducing apparatus for the disc-shaped
recording medium, the pre-recorded area and the non-recorded
recordable area are controlled by control data recorded in
the control data recording area. For example, in the optical disc
conforming to the CD-DA format, the recording start address
information and the recording end address information are
sequentially recorded for all of the program data in a lead-in
region as a table-of-contents (TOC) information
