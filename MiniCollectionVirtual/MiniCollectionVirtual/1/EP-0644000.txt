<CLAIMS>
A procedure for processing natural or synthetic,
inorganic or organic fibers and fiber-containing

materials into fiber-free material suspensions or
powders, wherein a combination of cold-embrittlement

and multiple-stage disintegrative grinding takes
place, characterized in that an additional

selective pulverization of the pulped fibers takes
place in a centrifugal field.
A procedure according to claim 1, characterized in
that in particular asbestos-containing materials are

involved.
A procedure according to claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that cold embrittlement takes place

with liquid nitrogen.
A procedure according to claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that multiple-stage disintegrative

grinding takes place in vibrating mills.
A procedure according to claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that a centrifugal reactor is used

for treatment in the centrifugal field.
A procedure according to claim 5, characterized in
that the centrifugal reactor is designed for the

continuous treatment of suspensions.
A procedure according to claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the generated material 

suspensions are directly processed into shaped
bricks via heat treatment.
A procedure according to claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the fiber-free suspensions are

provided as a dehydrated and dried raw material.
