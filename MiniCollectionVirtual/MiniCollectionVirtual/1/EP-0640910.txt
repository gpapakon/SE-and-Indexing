<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a control process for a circuit of the first in-first out type allowing the management of m words of n bits. This circuit consists of n shift registers with m stages in series, the even stages being controlled by a first clock signal and the odd stages by a second clock signal, the clock signals not overlapping. In this case, the process includes:   - a first step of writing in which each word is written, as a function of the clock signals, to two successive stages, this first step ending when m/2 words are written; - a second step of writing in which, on each clock signal, writing to the m
<
th
>
 stage down to the first stage is prohibited in succession, writing being carried out in accordance with the first step to the as yet unprohibited stages, and - a step of reading consisting in shifting the words in succession from one stage to another on each clock signal, the reading of a word being carried out on completion of the shift.   It can be employed in a circuit such as represented in Figure 5. The invention applies, in particular, to the processing of HD.MAC video lines.

comprising:

a first write step in which each word is written, as
a function of the clock signals, into two successive

stages, this first step terminating when m/2 words are
written;
a second write step in which at each clock signal,
writing into the m

 stage down to the first stage is
disabled in succession, writing being carried out

according to the first step into the stages which are
not yet disabled, and
a read step consisting in shifting the words from one
stage into another in succession at each clock signal,

the reading of a word being carried out at the end of
the shifting.
