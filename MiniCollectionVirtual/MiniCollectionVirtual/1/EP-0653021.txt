<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pair of conveyor worms for rotary positive-displacement pumps, the conveyor worms of which, which are formed as a rotor and counter-rotor, rotate contactlessly in the drilling and the sides at the same speed (worm-drive pump), form loss gaps between them and have the same throat depth and pitch and symmetrical flank profiles on each side, made up with respect to their land height of a tooth base beneath the flank profile reversal point (q) and a tooth head thereabove. To provide an improvement it is proposed that the height of the loss gap (c) determined by the profile in the axial section on the pitch circle can be kept constant for a given rotor diameter (DK) by shifting the flank profile reversal point (q) as a function of a technically attainable rotor rise (H).

Pair of conveyor worms for rotary positive-displacement 
pumps of which the conveyor worms, designed as rotor and 

counter-rotor, revolve at identical speeds without 
contact in the bore and in the flanks (screw pumps), form 

leakage gaps between themselves and have identical thread 
depths, identical numbers of starts and flank profiles 

which are symmetrical in design on either side and are 
composed, with respect to their lead, of a tooth foot 

located beneath the cusp point (q) of the flank profile 
and a tooth head located above this cusp point (q) of the 

flank profile respectively, characterized in that the 
profile-dependent leakage gap height (c) is kept constant 

in the axial section on the pitch circle for a specific 
rotor diameter (D
K
) by displacement of the cusp point (q) 
of the flank profile as a function of an industrially 

viable rotor pitch (H). 
Pair of conveyor worms according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the cusp point (q) of the flank 

profile rises in the ratio of the rotor diameter (D
K
) to 
the rotor pitch (H). 
Pair of conveyor worms according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the cusp point (q) of the flank profile increases 

- within the line of products characterized by the ratio of foot 
diameter (D
F
): head diameter (D
K
) = NÃ¼ - with decreasing rotor 
pitch (H) beyond the pitch circle radius (m) to a value (q
max
) 
which is at most r = 1. 
Pair of conveyor worms according to claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the rise of the cusp point (q) of 

the flank profile begins from a minimum value which is 
greater than the pitch circle radius (m). 
Pair of conveyor worms according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the profile-dependent 

leakage gap height (c), which is to be kept constant, in  
 

the axial section on the pitch circle lies in the range 
of o.1%. to 1.5%, preferably 0.1% to 0.8% of the rotor 

diameter (D
K
). 
Pair of conveyor worms according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that, with multi-stage rotors, 

only the stages located closest to the suction side have 
optimum leakage gap distribution according to one of the 

preceding claims. 
Pair of conveyor worms according to claim 6, 
characterized in that with a multistage rotor the cusp 

point (q) of the flank profile changes continuously, 
stepwise or often unsteadily in direction to its optimum 

position, up to the stage located closest to the suction 
side.
