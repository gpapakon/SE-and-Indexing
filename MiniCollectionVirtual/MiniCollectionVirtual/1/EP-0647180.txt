<ABSTRACT>
An iron powder composition comprising an iron powder coated with a substantially uniform coating of a thermoplastic material and admixed with a boron nitride powder and a method of utilizing the mixture to produce a magnetic core component is provided. The iron powder mixture is formulated with up to about 1 % by weight of boron nitride which reduces the stripping and sliding die ejection pressures during high temperature molding and also improves the permeability of the magnetic part over an extended frequency range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to iron-based powder
compositions useful in molding magnetic components and methods
of making thermoplastic-coated powder constituents of those
compositions. It also relates to methods of making magnetic
core components from the compositions which retain high
permeability over an extended frequency range.The study of magnetic core components used in
electrical/magnetic energy conversion devices such as
generators and transformers requires analysis of several
physical and electromagnetic properties for the core
component. Two key characteristics of an iron core component
are its magnetic permeability and core loss characteristics.
The magnetic permeability of a material is an indication of
its ability to become magnetized, or its ability to carry a
magnetic flux. Permeability is defined as the ratio of the
induced magnetic flux to the magnetizing force or field
intensity. When a magnetic material is exposed to a rapidly
varying field, a resultant energy loss in the core occurs.
The core losses are commonly divided into two categories:
hysteresis and eddy current losses. The hysteresis loss is
brought about by the necessary expenditure of energy to
overcome the retained magnetic forces within the iron core
component. The eddy current loss is brought about by the
production of electric currents in the iron core component due 
to the changing flux caused by alternating current (AC)
conditions.Early magnetic core components were made from
laminated sheet steel, however, these components were
unsatisfactory due to large core losses at higher frequencies
and due to manufacturing difficulties. Application of these
lamination-based cores is also limited by the necessity to
carry magnetic flux only in the plane of the sheet in order
to avoid excessive eddy current losses. Sintered metal
powders have been used to replace the laminated steel as the
material for the magnetic core component, but these sintered
parts also have high core losses and are restricted primarily
to direct current (DC) operations.Research in the technology of magnetic core
components has recently been centered around the use of
unsintered iron-based powders which contain various coatings
upon the iron powder particles. This research has strived to
develop iron powder compositions which enhance certain
physical and magnetic properties without detrimentally
affecting other properties. Desired properties include a high
permeability through an extended frequency range, high pressed
strength, low core losses, and suitability
