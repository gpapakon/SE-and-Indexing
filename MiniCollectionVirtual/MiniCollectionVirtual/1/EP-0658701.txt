<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic oscillation damper (shock absorber) with a damper cylinder (1) containing a damping fluid, with a piston rod (2) which moves backwards and forwards in the said cylinder and bears a damping piston (3), with a guide stopper (11) arranged at the end of the damper cylinder (1) penetrated by the piston rod, and with a stop cap (6) arranged around the piston rod (2), in which damper the edge of the damper cylinder (1) is folded over radially inwards, reaching over the guide stopper (11). According to the invention, the stop cap (6) is supported on an axial cylindrical region (5) which adjoins the folded-over radial area (4) of the damper cylinder (1) and has a smaller diameter than the damper cylinder (1). By virtue of the invention, the stop cap (6), against which the compression stop designed, for example, as a rubber buffer strikes during compression, can absorb the occurring axial forces better.

Hydraulic vibration damper for motor vehicles having a damping cylinder (1) 
containing a damping fluid , a piston rod (2) which supports a damping piston (3) 

and moves in a reciprocating manner in the said damping cylinder, a guide closing 
device (11) disposed at that end of the damping cylinder which is penetrated by the 

piston rod (2) and a stop cap (6) disposed about the piston rod (2), wherein the edge 
of the damping cylinder (1) is flanged inwards embracing the guide closing device 

(11), characterised in that an axial cylindrical region (5) having a smaller diameter 
than the damping cylinder (1) is adjacent to the radial flanged region (4) of the 

damping cylinder (1) and the said axial cylindrical region supports the stop cap (6). 
Hydraulic vibration damper for motor vehicles having a damping cylinder (1) 
containing a damping fluid, a piston rod (2) which supports a damping piston (3) and 

moves in a reciprocating manner in the said damping cylinder, an outer cylinder (7) 
which surrounds the damping cylinder (1), a guide closing device (11) which closes 

the damping and outer cylinder and a stop cap which is disposed about the piston 
rod (2), wherein the edge of the outer cylinder (7) is flanged inwards embracing the 

guide closing device (11), characterised in that an axial cylindrical region (9) having 
a smaller diameter than the outer cylinder (7) is adjacent to the radial flanged region 

(8) of the outer cylinder (7) and the said axial cylindrical region supports the stop cap 
(6). 
Vibration damper as claimed in claim 1 or 2, that the outer periphery of the 
damping cylinder (1) or of the outer cylinder (7) protrudes with its inner contour (15) 

beyond the radial flanged region (4, 8). 
Vibration damper as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
axial cylindrical region (5; 9) comprises a diameter of half the total of the diameter 

of the damping cylinder (1) or of the outer cylinder (7) and the piston rod (2).  
 
Vibration damper as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
edge (10) of the axial cylindrical region (5; 9) is flanged at least radially. 
Vibration damper as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a 
seal (16) is disposed between the piston rod (2) and the stop cap (6) and the radial 

region (16a) of said seal lies between the guide closing device (11) and the stop 
cap (6) and the axial region (16b) of said seal surrounds the piston rod (2). 
Vibration damper as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the axial region 
(16b) comprises a contact edge (16c) which is connected to the piston rod.
