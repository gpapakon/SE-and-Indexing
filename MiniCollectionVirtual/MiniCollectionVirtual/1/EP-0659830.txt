<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polypropylene
resin composition for coating the exterior parts of
automobiles which can afford an excellent coating adherence,
a high rigidity, high impact strength at low temperatures,
prominent heat resistance and an excellent appearance to
moldings even without effecting a pretreatment step, i.e.,
treatment with trichloroethane before coating, in addition
without applying a primer as undercoating.Recently automotive parts have been made to have
an increasingly thinner wall thickness as an increasingly
larger type of automobile having a lighter weight has been
manufactured, so that there is a need for coating materials,
which enable coatings excellent in heat resistance, impact
strength at low temperatures, and in appearance to be
produced on moldings without using any primer, and which are
also advantageous in cost.There have been heretofore proposed for such
materials numerous compositions comprising a combination of
crystalline polypropylenes with rubber and inorganic
fillers. However, most exterior automotive parts are likely 
to be attached in place after painted to have brilliant and
high grade perception. Current techniques for the paintings
employ the steps of treating moldings with a vapor of 1,1,1-trichloroethane
normally for 30 seconds to degrease and
etch, then undercoating with a primer, and then applying a
polyurethane paint as overcoating.Japanese Patent KOKAI (Laid-open) No. 63-128045
discloses an improved coating composition comprising a
polypropylene polymer composition having an excellent
adhesiveness with polyurethanes as overcoating even without
using any primer. In this patent, however, a treatment with
a vapor of 1,1,1-trichloroethane is required.The use of 1,1,1-trichloroethane was restricted
and decided to be entirely inhibited in 1995, together with
the flon gas regulation, by the conference held in London
June, 1990. Therefore, coating materials for automotive
parts simply having rigidity, strength, heat resistance and
impact strength at low temperatures are not sufficient to
cope with the regulations unless they allow the treatment
with 1,1,1-trichloroethane to be omitted and in addition
enhanced coating adherence to be achieved advantageously in
cost even without applying any primer. Development of such
coating materials has been vigorously sought.As a result of our intensive research made to
overcome the difficulties as described above, it has been
found that they can be overcome by using a specific
polypropylene resin composition having
