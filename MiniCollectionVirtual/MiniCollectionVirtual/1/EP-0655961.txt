<ABSTRACT>
A solder paste (24 in Fig. 1) of the type utilized in forming a solder connection (32 in Fig. 2) for a microelectronic package comprises a mixture of compositionally distinct metal powders. The paste comprises a first metal powder formed of tin-bismuth solder alloy. The paste further comprises a second metal powder containing gold or silver. During reflow, the gold or silver alloys with the tin-bismuth solder to increase the melting part and enhance mechanical properties of the product connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solder paste for forming a tin-bismuth
solder connection having enhanced high temperature
properties. More particularly, this invention relates to a solder
paste that comprises a mixture of tin-bismuth alloy powder and a
powder of a tertiary metal, preferably gold or silver, effective to
enhance the high temperature properties of the product connection.Solder paste is employed to form a solder connection, for
example, for surface mounting a component to a printed circuit
board or the like. A typical paste comprises a powder formed of a
solder alloy and dispersed in a liquid vehicle that contains a flux.
The vehicle may also comprise an expendable organic binder to
hold the powder in a self-sustaining mass following application. To
form the connection, the board features a solder-wettable bond pad
that constitutes a first faying surface. Similarly, the component
includes a second, solder-wettable faying surface, for example, a
contact. The solder paste is conveniently applied to the bond pad,
for example, by screen printing, after which the component is
arranged with the second faying surface in contact with the solder
paste deposit. The assembly is then heated to vaporize the vehicle
and to melt and reflow the solder alloy. Upon cooling, the solder
alloy resolidifies and bonds to the faying surfaces to complete the
connection. The solder connection not only physically attaches the
component to the board, but also electrically connects the bond pad
on the board and the contact of the component for conducting
electrical current to or from the component for processing.Common solder is formed of tin-lead alloy. It is proposed to
form a lead-free solder connection composed of tin-bismuth alloy.
However, tin-bismuth alloy tends to exhibit poor mechanical 
properties at elevated temperatures of the type encountered by microelectronic packages
during use. In particular, such solder alloys tend to become unacceptably soft at
temperatures as low as 100° C and exhibit a relatively low melting temperature,
particularly in comparison to the common tin-lead solders.US-A-4657589 describes a solder composition containing a small amount of gold
added to a solder metal in order to avoid cracking of solder joints in electronic circuits.US-A-4373974 describes a solder composition of finely divided solder metals
dispersed in a vehicle containing viscosity controlling agents, organic solvents and a
rosin.Document "Principles of soldering and brazing", ed. G. Humpson et al, March
