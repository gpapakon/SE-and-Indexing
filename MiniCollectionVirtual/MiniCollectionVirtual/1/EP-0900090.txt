<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a filtering device (1) for neutralizing volatile bad smells present in the atmosphere or carried by a flow of gas (5). The device comprises at least a layer (3) of natural zeolite material of set thickness impregnated with an aqueous solution with, for 100 parts by weight of zeolite, about 5 to about 20 parts by weight of the said aqueous solution. This aqueous solution comprises for 1000 parts by weight of water, between about 1 part and about 20 parts by weight of a composite mixture comprising, for one part of ammonium ions or equivalent, one part of at least of one perfuming and/or deodorising composition.

Filtration device (1) for neutralizing the
volatile unpleasant odors present in an atmosphere or

conveyed by a stream of gas (5), this device comprising
at least one layer (3) of adsorbent material (12) of

determined thickness impregnated with an aqueous
solution (14), with, per 100 parts by weight of

material, about 5 to 20 parts by weight of
said aqueous solution, 
characterized in that
the material is natural zeolite comprising at least one
material chosen from clinoptilolite, mordenite,

chabazite, erionite, phillipsite, heulandite and
analcime,
in that
 the device comprises humidification means
and 
in that
 said aqueous solution is cationic and
comprises, per 1000 parts by weight of water, between

about 1 and 20 parts by weight of a
composite mixture comprising, per one part of ammonium

ions or equivalent, one part of at least one
composition of perfuming and/or deodorizing nature.
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the aqueous solution comprises between about 3
and 10 parts of composite mixture.
Device according to either of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the layer (3) made of
natural zeolite is formed of granular material with an

average particle size of between about 0.1 cm and about
5 cm.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the composition of
perfuming and/or deodorizing nature comprises an

amount, which is effective for neutralizing the
unpleasant odors, of a compound represented by the

following structural formula: 


in which n is an integer from 2 to 4, A, B and C each
independently represent hydrogen, a lower alkyl group

containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms or a lower alkenyl group
containing 3 to 5 carbon atoms, on condition that when

two of the groups, A, B and C, are alkyl or alkenyl
groups, they are attached to different carbon atoms and

provided that the sum of the carbon atoms in A, B and C
is not greater than 7, R1 and R2 each independently

represent hydrogen or a lower alkyl group containing 1
to 5 carbon atoms, in which R1 and R2 together

represent CH2m in which m is an integer from 2 to 6, R3
represents hydrogen or a lower alkyl or alkenyl group

containing up to 6 carbon atoms, provided that the sum
of the greatest number of carbon atoms in R1 or R2 plus

R3 is not greater than 10.
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the composition of perfuming
and/or deodorizing nature is produced from aromatic

esters and/or from a complex aldehyde formation.
Device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the perfuming composition comprises a first
aldehyde chosen from acyclic and non-terpenic aliphatic

aldehydes, alicyclic non-terpenic aldehydes, terpenic
aldehydes, aliphatic aldehydes substituted with an

aromatic group and biofunctional aldehydes and a second
aldehyde chosen from aldehydes containing unsaturation

Î± to the aldehyde function conjugated with an aromatic
ring and aldehydes whose function is borne by an

aromatic ring.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 it also comprises means 
for forced circulation of the stream of gas through the

layer of material in the device.
Process for treating the volatile unpleasant
odors present in an atmosphere or conveyed by a stream

of gas, in which process the atmosphere or the stream
of gas is treated by filtration with a filter composed

of a layer of adsorbent material of determined
thickness impregnated with an aqueous solution, with,

per 100 parts by weight of material, about 5 to about
20 parts by weight of said aqueous solution,


characterized in that
 the material is natural zeolite
comprising at least one material chosen from

clinoptilotite, mordenite, chabazite, erionite,
phillipsite, heulandite and analcime,

said aqueous solution comprising, per 1000 parts by
weight of water, between about 1 part and about 20

parts by weight of a composite mixture comprising, per
one part of ammonium ions or equivalent, one part of at

least one composition of perfuming and/or deodorizing
nature.
Process according to Claim 8, 
characterized in
that
 forced circulation of the atmosphere or of the
stream of gas through the filter is carried out by

sucking said atmosphere or said stream of gas through

said filter.
