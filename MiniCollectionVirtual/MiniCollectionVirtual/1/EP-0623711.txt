<ABSTRACT>
Gulleys for surface drainage are mostly equipped with a dirt trap in the form of a bucket which is suspended or introduced into the gulley housing. For gulleys which are shallow and have a vertically adjustable attachment piece, buckets of different heights have to be supplied. The novel dirt-trap bucket is characterised in that it is divided in two in height and the upper part can be vertically adjusted with respect to the lower part in a plurality of screw holes located one above the other. The dirt-trap bucket can thus be adapted to the overall height present in the gulley.
