<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to non-aqueous 
electrochemical cells or batteries of both primary and secondary 
(rechargeable) types and, more particularly, to a Lithium-based 
electrochemical cell utilizing a solid polymer electrolyte which 
has inherent properties that result in operational safety, in 
addition to high energy density and excellent packaging 
flexibility. Specifically, the invention involves the formation of 
a lithium/polymer-based electrochemical cell utilizing a solid 
gelled film polymeric electrolyte (SPE) system including 
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) in combination with one or more solvent 
plasticizers together with one or more lithium salts and, if 
desired, photoinitiators or crosslinking agents. The electrolyte 
film is combined with an anode, a composite cathode and current 
collector in an extremely thin laminar structure and offers 
configurations of different voltages based on the cathode active 
material. It is known that non-aqueous active metal, particularly 
lithium, cells have allowed those skilled in the art to achieve 
much greater energy densities or energy to weight ratios than had 
been possible with other electrochemical couples. The wide range 
of potential uses for these cells has led to a great deal of  
 
interest in improving the performance and safety of the cells and 
to develop more reliable primary and secondary or rechargeable 
cells utilizing these materials. Such cells normally consist of a 
light, strongly reducing anode, normally an alkali metal such a 
lithium or a lithium intercalation compound, an aprotic, non-aqueous 
liquid solvent/depolarizer into which an appropriate 
quantity of an electrolyte salt of the anode metal has been 
dissolved to form a conductive electrolyte solution and an 
oxidizing agent as the cathode material. Prior cells using lithium intercalation or insertion compounds 
as anodes are shown, for example, in U.S. Patent 5 147 739 to 
Beard, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and 
intercalation materials used for the positive cathode electrodes 
including LiCoO₂, TiS₂, MoS₂, V₂O₅, V₆O₁₃ and other such compounds are 
illustrated in U.S. Patent 4 804 596 to Ebner and Lin (a coinventor 
in the present invention) also common of assignee. A 
further patent, U.S. Patent 4 853 304, also to Ebner and Lin and 
commonly assigned, discloses an improved non-aqueous electrolyte 
solution for lithium cells which utilizes an organic-based 
electrolyte system. That system is one in which an organic ester
