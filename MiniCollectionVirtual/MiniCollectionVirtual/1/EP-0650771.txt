<ABSTRACT>
A glue applicator (10) for storing and applying 
liquid glue. The applicator (10) includes an elongated 

generally cylindrical body member (12), a rigid elongated 
inner core member (14) positioned within the body member (12), a 

fibrous tip member (16), a liquid glue material contained 
within the body member (12), and means for sealing the distal 

end of the body member (12). The body member (12) includes a 
squeezable portion (28) of generally elliptical transverse 

cross-section located adjacent a distal end portion (24) 
thereof. The inner core member (14) includes portions 

thereof that are in contact with an inner surface of the 
body member (12) along the length thereof. The fibrous tip (16) 

is received in an elongated cavity (46) formed in a distal 
end portion of the inner core member (14). A plurality of 

openings formed through the inner core member (14) permit the 

passage of liquid glue from the body member (12) therethrough 
into the cavity (46) so as to contact the fibrous tip member (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a glue or 
solvent bonder applicator for storing and applying a 
liquid glue or solvent bonder material. More 
specifically, the invention is directed to a glue 
applicator device that is particularly useful during the 
assembly of polystyrene plastic model kits. There are numerous prior art devices for 
storing and applying glue or solvent bonder materials. 
Such devices typically include a flexible body or tube 
portion that is squeezed to force a liquid glue or 
bonder material contained therein through a nozzle 
having a relatively small opening. Such devices may 
include an internal valve to control the flow of 
materials that may be actuated by the application of a 
force thereto. There are also similar devices that have 
a substantially rigid body that rely on gravity to 
direct the liquid material through a distal opening. 
Such devices have been provided with brushes and fibrous 
tips to facilitate application of the liquid glue or 
bonder material. There is a need for an improved glue 
applicator device for storing and applying a liquid glue 
or bonder material that provides constant glue or bonder 
availability at the delivery tip without the use of an 
internal valve. It is desirable that such a device be 
able to instantly make available extra glue or bonder 
material at the point of application. It is further 
desirable that the device have a delivery tip that 
remains constantly moist with glue or bonder material so  
 
that it is ready for use without having to be primed. 
It is also desirable that the device be ergonomically 
designed in order to facilitate the delivery of plastic 
model glue or bonder material to the model builder in a 
manner that ensures a clean and well-assembled model. The present invention provides an 
ergonomically designed glue applicator for storing and 
applying a liquid glue or bonder solvent material. The 
glue applicator includes an elongated generally 
cylindrical body member, a rigid elongated inner core 
member positioned within the body member, a fibrous tip 
member, a liquid glue or bonder material contained 
within the body member, and a means for sealing the 
distal end of the body member. The elongated body member has a closed 
proximal end portion and an open distal end portion. A 
squeezable portion, located adjacent the distal end 
portion, is of increased cross-sectional dimension and 
may be deflected inwardly by a force applied by a 
finger. The squeezable portion is generally elliptical 
in transverse

A glue applicator for storing and applying 
liquid glue, comprising: 


(a) an elongated generally cylindrical 
body member having a closed proximal end portion and an 

open distal end portion, said body member having a 
squeezable portion located adjacent the distal end 

portion thereof that may be deflected inwardly by a 
force applied by a finger; 
(b) a substantially rigid elongated inner 
core member positioned within said body member and 

extending along substantially the entire length thereof, 
said inner core member having portions thereof that are 

in contact with an inner surface of said body member 
along the length thereof, said inner core member having 

a distal end portion and a proximal end portion, said 
distal end portion of said inner core member having an 

elongated cavity formed therein that extends distally 
beyond the distal end portion of said body member; 
(c) a fibrous tip member having a proximal 
end portion that is received within said cavity and a 

distal end portion that extends distally beyond the 
distal end portion of said inner core member; 
(d) liquid glue contained with said body 
member, said inner core member having a plurality of 

openings formed therein for permitting the passage of 
said liquid glue from said body member therethrough into 

said cavity so as to contact said fibrous tip member; 
and 
(e) means for sealing the distal end of 
said body member to preclude liquid glue from escaping 

from said body member other than through said cavity. 
The glue applicator as described in claim 1 
wherein said squeezable portion is generally elliptical 

in transverse cross-section.
