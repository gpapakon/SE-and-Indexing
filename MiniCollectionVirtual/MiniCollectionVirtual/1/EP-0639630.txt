<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
stabilizing bitumen-polymer blends.It is known that in order to improve the quality
of bitumen, in particular from the rehological
viewpoint, several types of copolymers, in particular
of elastomeric type, are often used.So, e.g., US-A-4,217,259 teaches using
symmetrical radial copolymers constituted by dienic
and vinylaromatic blocks; US-A-4,585,816 teaches using
block copolymers of a monoalkenyl aromatic monomer and
a conjugated diolefin; US-A-3,915,914 teaches using 1-butene
homopolymers and copolymers; US-A-3,615,830
claims isoolefin copolymers, in particular
polyisobutene.The most effective polimeric additives seem to be
the styrene-diolefin block copolymers, in particular
styrene/butadiene and styrene/isoprene block
copolymers.The so modified bitumens can be destined to uses
for which the performance of normal bitumens proves to
be insufficient. Thus, applications in the field of
draining and sound-absorbent conglomerates, in the
field of water-proofing systems, and so forth, may be
cited.However, the polymers used in order to modify the
properties of bitumens generally display the drawback
of being poorly compatible with bitumens. This lack of
compatibility manifests itself as a trend of both
components to undergo phase separation under resting 
conditions; in that way, a polymer-rich top layer and
a bitumen-rich bottom layer are formed.The above said drawback is particularly serious
when the production locality does not coincide, as it
often happens, with the application locality, or when
between the preparation time and the application time,
a time period elapses.Therefore, the storage-stability, in particular
when hot, of bitumen-polymer blends results to be very
important for the purposes of a correct and
advantageous use thereof.In order to solve this problem, BE-858,770; BE-858,771
and BE-870,287 disclose reactions of bitumen
with polyolefins containing one or more double bonds.
The polyolefin is anchored to bitumen by means of
sulfur, which acts as a crosslinking agent.EP-A-0 496 457 discloses a process which
consists in causing the bitumen-polymer blend to react
with an unsaturated dicarboxy acid, or dicarboxy acid
anhydrides, in particular with maleic anhydride. This
process displays the drawback deriving from the
toxicity of maleic anhydride.A process which overcomes the above said
drawbacks has been found now.In accordance therewith, the present invention
relates to a process for stabilizing blends of bitumen
and thermoplastic polymer,
