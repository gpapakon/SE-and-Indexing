A process for detecting non-linear behaviour of a 
digital data transmission link (4) to be investigated 


wherein a sample signal (M′) is formed in that a 
sequence (m) comprising spectral components 

(S1..S10) equidistantly distributed in the 
frequency range are logic-linked to an additional 

function (ZSF) such that the sample signal (M′) 
contains, in addition to the spectral components 

(S1...S10) of the sequence (m), additional, 
preferably at least partially equidistant, spectral 

components (ZS1...ZS21), 
wherein the transmission link (4) is supplied at 
the input end with the periodically transmitted 

sample signal (M′) and 
wherein an output signal (M″), received at the 
output end of the link as a result of the sample 

signal (M′), is analyzed at given analysis 
frequencies (AW1...AW10), where frequencies at 

which the sample signal (M′) is itself free of 
spectral components and at which the sample signal 

(M′), after self-convolution within the frequency 
domain, exhibits additional spectral components 

(SA1..SA10) are selected as analysis frequencies 
(AW1...AW10). 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the sequence (m) is multiplicatively linked with 

the additional function (ZSF). 
A process as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in 
that a trigonometric function is used as additional 

function (ZSF). 
A process as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a binary, bipolar random  

 
numerical sequence signal with a crest factor of 

preferably one is used as sequence (m), that the output 
signal (M″) is cross-correlated in the time domain or 

multiplied in the frequency domain with a reference 
signal corresponding to the sample signal (M′) with the 

acquisition of a measurement signal (KKF), and that the 
measurement signal (KKF) is analyzed in dependence upon 

the magnitude of the additional spectral components 
(SA1...SA10).
