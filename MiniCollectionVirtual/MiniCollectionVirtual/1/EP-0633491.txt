<ABSTRACT>
A projector that has a shortened optical path 
from a light valve to a screen and a reduction in the 

depth size of its system and which requires less space 
to mount. Rays of light emitted from a light valve 

(12) are refracted by a converging lens (13) and 
reflected by a plane mirror (14) to converge at the 

primary focal point (F1) of an elliptical mirror (15) 
and then travel toward the secondary focal point 

(F2) whereat the focal point of a parabolic mirror (17) 
also exists and a projection lens (16) is disposed. The 

light rays pass through the projection lens, are 
reflected by the parabolic mirror (17) and then brought 

to a parallel beam of light that is further collected 
by a Fresnel lens (18) to finally form an image on a 

lenticular lens-screen (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a projector and,
more particularly, to a projector which is devised to
have a shorter optical path from the light valve to the
screen by applying the combination of an elliptical
mirror and a parabolic mirror for projecting or a
combination of two parabolic mirrors or a combination
of a parabolic mirror for projecting and an elliptical
mirror for projecting.A conventional projector is composed of a light
source, a liquid-crystal type light-valve (with a
single liquid-crystal panel or three liquid-crystal
panels to include a spectroscopic system), a
projection lens and plane mirrors (single or two
piece), and a combination unit comprising of a Fresnel
lens and a lenticular one that is, a lens and screen.
They work on the same well-known principle as a cathode
ray tube (CRT) works. It is well known that the size of
the depth of the projector's casing, accommodating
therein an optical path from the liquid-crystal type
light valve to the screen, mainly depends upon the 
size of the projection mirror (plane mirror) placed
immediately before the screen. Many attempts have been
made to produce a projector having a shorter optical
path.A projector is disclosed in the Japanese laying-open
Utility Model No. 63-73792. This is a liquid
display which has a casing with a display window
provided with a front transparent screen and which
includes therein a transparent liquid-crystal display
panel, a light source for illuminating the liquid-crystal
display panel from the back and a projection
lens for projecting an enlarged image of the liquid-crystal
display panel onto the screen. In the casing, a
prism having a light-emitting plane larger than the
display window is placed with its light-emitting
surface in contact with or near the internal surface
of the display window with its incident plane opposed
to the projection lens directly or through the mirrors
indirectry. The liquid-crystal display panel is placed
opposite the projection lens directly or indirectly
through the mirror.A projector is disclosed in the Japanese Utility
Model publication No. 4-38346, wherein rays of light
images from a liquid-crystal display panel are
reflected by the plane mirror pass through the
projection lens and are reflected by the plane mirrors 
to form an image on the screen.A projector is disclosed, wherein rays of light
emitted from the liquid-crystal panel through the
projection lens are collected by a Fresnel lens to
form an image on the lenticular screen. It is highlighted
by placing the
