<ABSTRACT>
Described is a shoe (1) with a central rotary fastener (3) fitted on an insole cover (2) and with a tensioning element (4) linked to the fastener (3), the tensioning element having loops (5, 6) projecting out sideways from the insole cover (2) and the loops (5, 6) passing round studs (7) on free-moving coupling elements (8). Each of the coupling elements (8) has a bar over which a tensioning strap (24) passes in a zig-zag or sawtooth configuration.

Footwear (1), especially footwear for sport or leisure, having
 
a central rotary closure (3) which is fitted to an instep shield (2) 

and coupled to at least one strain strap (4) which is led out to the 
sides from the instep shield (2) in the form of two or more loops each 

of which in turn is led over a deflector element (7) on a respective 
coupling member (8) in the region of the side parts of the upper of the 

footwear, so that for closing the footwear (1) the loops may he shortened 
by turning the rotary member of the central rotary closure (3) and for 

opening may be lengthened, characterized by the following features: 

the deflector elements (7) are in each case provided on a freely 
movable coupling member (8); 
each coupling member (8) has one deflector-strut (14); 
in the region of the main toe joints or in the region (29) between 
the main toe joints and the metatarsus a tie-strap (24) is fastened 

to the footwear (1), the upper (26) or the sole (27); 
the tie-strap (24) is led over the deflector-strut (14) of the front 
coupling member (8) to a deflector element (30) in the region (29) 

of the metatarsus and from there over the deflector-strut (14) of 
another or the rear coupling member (8) and after deflection about 

the latter is led towards the rear to a point of attachment in the 
region (33) of the heel and there fixed; 
the coupling elements (8) are merely fixed ill position on the upper 
of the footwear by the loops (5, 6) and the tie-strap (24). 
Footwear as in Claim 1, characterized in that
 
the deflector element or elements (7) is/are made like buttons or 

mushrooms and respectively exhibit a guide-groove for the strain element 
or elements (4). 
Footwear as in Claim 2, characterized in that
 
the guide-grooves (8) are freely accessible at the rear of the 

deflector elements (7) and the strain element or elements (4) may be 
inserted in the guide-grooves (8) from the rear. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
 
the coupling member (8) exhibits two guide-arms (12, 13) running at 

an acute angle (Î±) to one another and provided with openings (19, 20, 21, 
22, 23) through which the tie-strap (24) is passed.  

 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
 
the tie-strap (24) is fastened at each end and the deflector elements 

(7) of the coupling members (8) as well as the deflector means (30) 
provided in the region (29) of the metatarsus are arranged in such a way 

that during the closing process a resultant tension (35) arises on the 
deflector element (7) of the front coupling member (8) in the direction 

towards the rear towards the metatarsus (region 29) and on the deflector 
element (7) of the rear coupling member (8) a resultant tension (36) 

arises, pointing down at a slight angle towards the rear in the 
direction of the region (33) of the heel. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
 
the tie-strap (24) is led or stretched in a zigzag or sawtooth form. 
Footwear as in Claim 6, characterized in that
 
portions (39, 40, 41, 42) of the tie-strap run forwards from below on 

a slope. 
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
 
at least at the points of attachment at its ends the tie-strap (24) 

rests against the upper (26) via bearer parts (28, 34). 
Footwear as in Claim 8, characterized in that
 
the bearer parts (28, 34) exhibit means (15, 16, 17, 18) of guiding 

and/or deflecting the tie-strap (24). 
Footwear as in Claim 9, characterized in that
 
the bearer parts (28, 34) exhibit openings (43) and bridges (44) and 

the tie-strap (24) is looped through the openings (43) or led via the 
bridges (44).
