<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the sensitization of 
gelatino, silver halide emulsions and to a method for 
improving the speed/fog ratio of said emulsions. Still 
more particularly, this invention relates to the 
addition of an aliphatic polyol to improve said 
speed/fog ratio. In my previously issued U.S. Patent 4,965,184 the 
use of 1-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid to improve the 
sensitization of a gelatino, silver halide emulsion is 
described. This compound is unusual in and of itself 
for use as such a sensitizer. Prior art sulfonic acids 
did not accomplish this increase in speed. The use of a 
chemical sensitizer usually results in a concurrent 
increase in emulsion fog and thus it is conventional to 
add an antifoggant or stabilizer to control this fog. 
The use of the latter compounds, although efficacious, 
usually results in a long term speed loss for the film 
element. Thus, there have been a continuing effort to 
find compounds or combinations of compounds which not 
only result in a higher level of sensitization but which 
will reduce the amount of fog generated. It is an object of this invention to sensitize 
gelatino, silver halide emulsions without generating 
excess fog. These and yet other objects are achieved by 
formation of a photosensitive element having at least 
one photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer 
containing a sensitizing amount of an alkali metal salt  
 
of 1-napthol-4-sulfonic acid in a concentration of from 
1 to 20 grams per 1.5 moles of silver halide present, 
characterized by said emulsion 
containing an aliphatic polyol whereby the speed to fog 
ratio of said element is improved. The use of 1-napthol-4-sulfonic acid and the alkali 
metal salts thereof is fully described in the 
aforementioned application. This material can be 
added to gelatino, silver halide emulsion in amounts 
ranging from 1 to 20 g /1.5 mole of silver halide 
present, with 2 to 8 g /1.5 mole of silver halide being 
preferred. The addition of this sensitizer will result 
in an increase of emulsion speed. However, some 
increase in emulsion fog has also been noted. The emulsions useful within the ambit of this 
invention include all of the common silver halides 
including silver bromide, silver iodide and silver 
chloride or mixtures of two or more of these halides. A 
particularly preferred emulsion is one of ca. 98 mol % 
bromide and ca. 2 mol % iodide with fairly large grains. 
These grains can be any of the commonly known grains 
such as cubic, rhombic, tetrahedral and tabular shapes, 
for
