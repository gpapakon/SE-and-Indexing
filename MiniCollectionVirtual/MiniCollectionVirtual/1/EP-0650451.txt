<ABSTRACT>
A disposable, compactable package for reliably dispensing a stack of sheet products, such as dry or premoistened wipes, one-at-a-time, even after the package has been deformed or compacted. The package comprises a top wall (11a) and a bottom wall (12) comprised of a resiliently deformable material. The top and the bottom walls are spaced from and oriented generally parallel to one another. They are connected to one another about their peripheries by means of a thinner more easily deformable substantially continuous tube or hoop (11b-11c) which is also comprised of resiliently deformable material. The substantially continuous tube or hoop, which is preferably integrally formed with either the top wall or the bottom wall, defines the sidewalls of the package. The tube, which may be of any desired cross-sectional shape, is also produced from material having a sufficient resilient memory that is easily and resiliently deformed when the external force is applied to the package, yet by virtue of its tubular configuration and its resilient memory exhibits a strong tendency to self-restore once the externally applied force is removed. The package, which is preferably rectangular, includes a preformed dispensing aperture (14) or means for providing a dispensing aperture in its top or its bottom wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the prior art of dry and premoistened sheet product 
packaging, two general forms of packages have been employed; 
flexible overwrap packaging and substantially rigid containers. 
Each package type has unique advantages. A conventional overwrap package is produced from 
flexible sheet materials and exhibits the advantages of being (i) 
easily compactable for efficient storage (e.g., purse, glove 
compartment, drawer) and (ii) relatively low in material cost. 
However, the flexible overwrap package's principal disadvantage is 
that it simply collapses as product is removed from the package, 
i.e., it is typically non-resilient. Thus, near the end of the 
flexible overwrap package's useful life it offers little or no 
structural integrity protection to the remaining product and 
oftentimes, due to its lack of form and difficulty of dispensing, 
may be discarded prior to complete emptying of its contents. By way of contrast a conventional substantially rigid 
package is made from more rigid materials such as cardboard, 
paperboard, carton board, stiff plastic, etc. Such substantially 
rigid packages offer the advantages of (i) protecting the product 
from crushing by resisting deformation, at least up to a point; 
and (ii) providing the user with a package which can be 
conveniently and reliably gripped to provide anchoring during 
dispensing without fear of inadvertently gripping the product 
sheets inside the package through the walls of the package. 
Unfortunately, substantially rigid packages of the aforementioned 
type are not readily compactable to facilitate easy, unobtrusive, 
temporary storage, such as in a purse or in the pocket of an 
article of wearing apparel. Furthermore, such substantially rigid 
packages will resist deformation only up to a predetermined point. 
EP 0 126 362 A1 (corresponding to the preamble of claims 1 and 2) discloses a container-dispenser 
of sanitary towels which allows easy and safe removal of the towels and limits 
evaporation of the volatile substances contained in the damp towels. It does not however teach 
a resiliently deformable package.  
 
Once that point is exceeded, such packages are permanently 
deformed or damaged or take on a permanent set. Accordingly, they  
 
do not exhibit any appreciable tendency to self-restore to their 
substantially original shape once the deforming force is removed. 
Thus, for packages used to dispense sheet products having a 
cross-sectional "footprint" bigger than the dispensing aperture in 
one or more of the package's

A package for reliably dispensing deformable sheet products from a 
stack contained therein even after said package has been deformed by an 

externally applied force, said package comprising 

a) a substantially planar top wall, 
b) a substantially planar bottom wall located in a plane which is remote 
from and substantially parallel to plane of said top wall; 
c) a tube having a pair of opposed ends, said opposed ends of said tube 
being secured to said top wall and said bottom wall about their respective 

peripheries to form an enclosure for said stack of sheet products, said tube 
comprising the side walls of said package, said side walls being thinner 

than said top wall and said bottom wall;

said planar top wall comprises a resiliently deformable material; said 

planar bottom wall comprises a resiliently deformable material; said tube is 
resiliently deformable and comprises a resiliently deformable material; and 

said package comprises a means for creating a dispensing aperture in at 
least one of said top wall and said bottom wall for dispensing said sheet 

products from said package in a one-at-a-time fashion, whereby said 
package containing said stack of deformable sheet products will readily 

undergo resilient deformation in response to said externally applied force 
but will exhibit a strong tendency to self-restore to its substantially 

undeformed configuration when said externally applied force is removed.
