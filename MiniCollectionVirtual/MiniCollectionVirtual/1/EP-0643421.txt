<ABSTRACT>
A first metallization layer is locally formed on the 
surface of a semiconductor substrate thereby leaving portions of 

the semiconductor substrate's surface exposed. A first silicon 
oxide layer is then formed in such a manner that it covers the 

exposed portions of the semiconductor substrate's surface and 
the first metallization layer. This is followed by the 

formation of an HMDS molecular layer on the first silicon oxide 
layer. Then, a second silicon oxide is formed on the molecular 

layer by means of a CVD process utilizing the chemical reaction 
of ozone with TEOS. Finally, a second metallization layer is 

locally formed on the second silicon oxide layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a semiconductor
device and associated semiconductor device fabrication method,
and, more particularly, to a technology for providing, in the
VLSI (very-large-scale integrated circuit) multilevel
metallization formation steps, an interlayer dielectric film
having an excellent uniformity of film thickness.As the scale of semiconductor device integration increases
and device dimensions decreases, demand for sophisticated
multilevel metallization technology becomes higher and higher.
The interlayer dielectric film serving as an insulator therefore
plays an important role to provide a conformal step coverage to
the walls and bottom of a fine step of a first metallization
layer having a high aspect ratio, and, recently, an atmospheric-pressure
chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) method utilizing the
reaction of tetra-ethyl-ortho-silicate (TEOS) with ozone (O3) has
been in intensive research, since TEOS deposition provides a
good step coverage.Referring now to the accompanying drawings, a conventional
semiconductor device fabrication process is described. FIGS.
11a-c show subsequent steps of the fabrication of a conventional
semiconductor device. Formed on semiconductor substrate 10 are
LOCOS film 11 for insulation/separation, polysilicon gate
electrode 12, boron oxide/phosphorus oxide-containing SiO2 layer
13 (hereinafter called "BPSG layer"), source (or drain) region
14 that is an impurity-diffused region, tungsten source (or
drain) electrode 15, and first metallization layer 16 that is an 
aluminum alloy layer having a content of about 1% silicon and
about 0.5% copper. In addition, gate insulating layer 17 is
shown in FIG. 11c.SiO2 layer 21 (hereinafter called "P-TEOS layer") is first
deposited on first metallization layer 16 by means of a plasma
CVD process from a TEOS source gas (see FIG. 11b).Next, SiO2 layer 22 (hereinafter called "TEOS-O3 layer") is
deposited by means of an APCVD process making use of the
reaction of TEOS with O3. This is followed by the formation of
second metallization layer 23 on TEOS-O3 layer 22 (see FIG. 11c).The above-described APCVD utilizing the reaction of TEOS
with ozone much depends on the underlying topography. Suppose
that an underlaying layer, or P-TEOS layer 21 has different
types of film properties, namely a hydrophilic (water-loving)
region and a hydrophobic (water-hating) region and TEOS-O3 layer
22 is deposited on such P-TEOS layer 21. In this case, TEOS-O3
layer 22 suffers some problems such as the differences in the
formation
