<ABSTRACT>
The kit comprises an external cup (1), an internal cup (2) and fastening elements (3, 3a) which can be attached to the external cup (1) so as to project radially. The fastening elements each comprise a support plate (17) located on a stalk-like support member (18) and supportable in an anchorage bore (6) in the osseous tissue (6), and a head member (20) releasably connected to the support member (18) and screwable from the inner side of the external cup (1) into a guide bore (11) of the external cup (1). The support member (18) has a diameter (A) which is smaller than the diameter (d1) of the guide bore (11). The kit can be assembled outside the implantation area and inserted in the implantation area by means of fastening elements (3, 3a) which are retracted toward the middle of the external cup (1). The fastening elements (3, 3a) can then be pushed into the anchorage bores (6) and screwed to the external cup (1) via the head members (20). The kit can be adapted to suit different anatomical conditions and can be used as a substitute for a missing part of the pelvis in the hip joint region.

<CLAIMS>
A kit for an artificial joint cup, especially an acetabular
cup, having the following features:


a metallic outer shell (1), having guide bores (11) each
provided with a thread (11a), mounted at differing solid angles

(A,B,C,E)
an inner shell (2) insertable into outer shell (1)
at least one securing element (3,3a), secured to outer shell
(1) intended for introduction into an anchorage bore (6)

constructed in the bone tissue (5), which has a head part (20,22)
which can be introduced from the inner side of outer shell (1)

into one of the guide bores (11),
whereby securing element (3,3a) is constructed in the form of
a supporting base in the anchorage bore (6), having a support

plate (17) which can be introduced into anchorage bore (6) which
is executed having a diameter (D) which is greater than diameter

(d
1
) of the relevant guide bore (11) and which is releasably
connected with head part (20) via a stalk-like support part (18),

which is executed having a diameter (d) which is smaller than
diameter (d
1
) of guide bore (11),
a manipulating cup (23) defined for preparation of the area
of bone tissue (5) incorporating outer shell (1), which

corresponds to the outer shell in respect of its outer
measurements, which is provided with passage openings (11')

arranged at the solid angles (A,B,C,E) of guide bores (11) of
outer shell (1), whose diameters (D
1
) correspond respectively to
diameter (D) of one of the support plates.
A kit according to claim 1, characterised in that at least
a screw connection (18c) is provided between support plate (17)

and head part (20). 
A kit according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in that
support part (18) is constructed from at least two parts (18a,18b)

which can be fitted together and which are longitudinally
releasable.
A kit according to claim 3, characterised in that it contains
a preparable store of such parts (18a,18b) in differing lengths

(L) for at least one of the parts (18a,18b) of support part (18).
A kit according to any of the preceding claims, characterised
in that at least one of the guide bores (11) of outer shell (1)

free from securing elements (3,3a), is provided with a cover
part e.g. a locking screw (13) which can be inserted into this

guide bore (11).
