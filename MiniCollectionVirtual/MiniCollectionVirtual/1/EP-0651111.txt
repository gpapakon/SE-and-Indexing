<ABSTRACT>
This device for fixing a rail (7 or 8) onto a vertical support stiffener (3) is characterised in that it has a tubular structure, capable of receiving, in a horizontal through-passage defined by openings (12, 13) made facing each other in its opposite walls, a clamp (9) whose ends (14, 15) are mutually symmetrical with respect to the mid-plane (16) of the stiffener, these ends receiving, in an open groove (19, 20), a plane flat piece (18) forming part of the rail (7, 8) to be immobilised, the clamp including a central bore (24) into which is engaged a screw (25) accessible from the rear of the stiffener, in such a way that rotation of the screw bearing on the inner wall of the stiffener exerts, by reaction, a movement of the clamp along the axis of this screw, thereby providing a clamping effect of the clamp and consequently the locking of the rail carried by the latter with respect to the stiffener.

Device for fitting and fastening a rail (7 or 
8), especially horizontal, having a railing (1) to a 

vertical tubular stiffener (3) supporting this rail, and
 
a linking member (9) secured to the stiffener and 

supporting the rail, characterized in that the 
stiffener (3) is able to 

receive, in a horizontal through-passage defined by 
openings (12, 13) of like profile made facing one 

another in its opposite walls, the linking member 
exhibiting the form of an elongate clasp (9) whose ends 

(14, 15), when this clasp is set in place in this 
passage, are mutually symmetric with respect to the 

mid-plane (16) of the stiffener, these ends outside the 
latter then being oriented towards the front of the 

stiffener in such a way as to receive in an open groove 
(19, 20) of the clasp a flat span (18) forming part of 

the rail (7, 8) to be immobilized, the clasp moreover 
including a tapped central bore (24) whose axis is 

oriented substantially in the mid-plane of the 
stiffener and in which is engaged a screw (25) 

accessible via the rear of the stiffener, so that the 
rotation of the screw bearing on the inner wall of the 

stiffener, engenders by reaction a displacement of the 
clasp along the axis of this screw, affording a binding 

effect of the clasp and accordingly the locking of the 
rail carried by the latter relative to the stiffener. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the clasp (9) exhibits a semi-circular profile,  

 
the ends (14, 15) of the clasp, outside the stiffener 

(3) , beyond the openings (12, 13) delimiting the 
passage through the stiffener in which the clasp is 

engaged, each including a slot (19, 20) open at the 
top, the two slots being arranged in the same vertical 

plane, substantially tangential to the wall of the 
stiffener, in front of the latter. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that each slot (19, 20) provided at the ends (14, 15) 

of the clasp (9) includes within it an inner recess 
(21), able to receive a relief rib (22) possibly 

provided at the lower end of the flat span (18) of the 
rail (7, 8) to be immobilized, and carried by the 

clasp. 
Device according to any one of Clains 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the clasp (9) includes in its 

mid-part a notch (23) whose width is substantially 
equal to that of the stiffener (3) square with the 

openings (12, 13) delimiting the through-passage in 
which the clasp is engaged, so that, upon the binding 

of the latter under the effect of the screw which it 
supports, the edges (23a, 23b) of this notch come to 

mask the lateral walls (10, 11) of the stiffener, 

shutting off these openings. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that each rail includes means of 

immobilizing a panel (6) or parallel bars (35), 
arranged in front of the flat span (18) supported by 

the clasp (9).  
 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the stiffener (3) includes a hole 

(27) for access to the head of the screw (25), made in 
the rear part of this stiffener for the insertion of a 

tool for rotating this screw. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the lateral walls (10, 11) of the stiffener (3) 

each include a continuous groove (30, 31), extending 
along a vertical generatrix made towards the rear of 

the stiffener so as to allow the fitting, in the manner 
of a clip, of the folded-down edges (32, 33) of a cover 

(34), concealing the hole (27) for access to the head 
of the screw (25).
