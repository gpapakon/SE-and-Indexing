<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). More particularly, the present
invention relates to methods of enhancing the
sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for
susceptibility effects.Several known functional MR imaging studies based
on detection of temporary changes in T2* which result
from local changes in magnetic susceptibility have been
conducted. Among these are measurements of regional
cerebral blood volume (rCBV) using a bolus injection of
contrast agent (A. Villringer et al, Magn. Reson. Med.,
Vol. 6 (1988), page 164; B.R. Rosen et al, Magn. Reson.
Q., Vol. 5 (1989), page 26; C.T.W. Moonen et al,
Science, Vol. 250 (1990), page 53; J.W. Belliveau et al,
Science, Vol. 254 (1990), page 716) and of local
changes in brain oxygenation state (S. Ogawa et al,
Magn. Reson. Med., Vol. 14 (1990), page 68; R. Turner et
al, Magn. Reson. Med., Vol. 22 (1991), page 159). Most
of these studies are carried out with echo-planar MRI 
methods because of their high intrinsic sensitive for
T2*. In principle, conventional methods based on
gradient-recalled echoes (A. Haase et al, Magn. Reson.,
Vol. 67 (1986), page 258; D. Matthaei et al, Lancet,
Vol. 2 (1985), page 893; F.W. Wehrli, Magn. Reson. Q.,
Vol., 6 (1990), page 165) are also T2* sensitive, but the
T2* sensitivity generally has to be compromised in order
to reach the desired time-resolution. For example,
blood volume measurements in the brain based on tracking
the passage of a bolus of contrast agent require a time-resolution
of the order of 1s per image due to the short
transit time of blood. For 128 phase encode steps, this
limits the TR (relaxation time) to about 8 ms and TE
(echo time) to about 5 ms.In T.W. Redpath et al "FADE-A New Fast Imaging Sequence"
Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Vol. 6 (1988) pages 224-234
there is disclosed a technique whereby a series of rapid,
equally spaced RF pulses of constant amplitude produce two
components of transverse magnetization. Both resulting echoes
are imaged separately in each interpulse interval. The second
component is strongly T2 weighted. In order to prevent
spillage from echo 1 to echo 2 a spoiling gradient pulse is
applied midway between two adjacent RF pulses.The present invention, hereafter referred to as an
"echo-shifted" gradient-recalled echo method, involves
methods of magnetic resonance imaging which have
enhanced sensitivity to T2* changes, as compared to
methods known heretofore. It is one object of the present invention to
provide a method of magnetic resonance

<CLAIMS>
A method for performing MRI imaging of an object which
comprises:


subjecting the object to a radio frequency
pulse (RF) to create transverse magnetization, said

radio frequency pulse (RF) having a time of
repetition TR ; and
generating a gradient recalled echo so that the
echo time period (TE) of the gradient-recalled echo

is greater than the time of repetition TR of the
radio frequency pulse (RF);

wherein

said echo is generated along the coherence pathway
p(-1, -1); and
all other coherence pathways which could lead to
observable echoes, are destroyed by means of

crusher gradient pulses having alternately reversed
polarities in subsequent TR intervals.
A method for performing MRI imaging of an object
according to claim 1,

wherein
a crusher gradient is applied at the beginning of each TR interval 

to dephase any
gradient recalled echo of spins

that are excited
by said radio frequency pulse and would otherwise remain in

the same TR interval.
A method for performing MRI imaging of an object
according to claim 2,

wherein said crusher gradient is applied in the slice
and/or phase direction.
A method for performing MRI imaging of an object
according to claim 2,

wherein a slice gradient is applied in each repetition
time period TR of said radio frequency pulse

(RF),
said slice gradient being

reversed before encountering a gradient-recalled
echo.
A method for performing MRI imaging of an object
according to claim 1,

wherein said imaged object is a dynamic object.
A method for performing MRI imaging of an object
according to claim 5,

wherein said object comprises body fluid. 
A method for performing MRI imaging of an object
according to claim 6,

wherein said body fluid comprises blood.
A method for performing MRI imaging of an object
according to claim 1,

wherein said method further includes injecting a
contrast agent into said object to be imaged.
