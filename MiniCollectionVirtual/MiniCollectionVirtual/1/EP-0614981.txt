<DESCRIPTION>
Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a protein produced by NK cells and 
activated helper T lymphocytes which has antiviral and 
antiproliferative activity and which plays a multipotent role in the 
control of the immune system and of the inflammatory response. It 
regulates antibodies formation and T lymphocytes or NK cells 
differentiation. It enhances the expression of Major Histocompatibility 
Complex (MHC) class I and II structures on several cell types, 
amplifying their antigen presentation (accessory cells) capacity. Acting 
on phagocytes, fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells, IFNγ plays a 
central role in the activation of non-specific defense mechanisms. It is 
the main activator of microbicidal and tumoricidal properties of 
macrophages, enhances phagocytosis, induces ADCC (Antibody 
Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity) and modulates the release of 
polypeptides encoded by MHC class III genes (i.e. complement 
components and TNFα), proteinase inhibitors (C1 inhibitor), IL1, GM-CSF, 
fibronectin, arachidonic acid metabolites, 1,25-hydroxy-vitamin 
D3, lysosomal enzymes (IP-30, hydrolases, neutral proteinases, i:e: 
uPA), and chemotactic factors (IP-10). Finally, IFNγ promotes cell-to-cell 
interaction, migration of phagocytes through connective tissue, 
chemotaxis and adhesion to extracellular matrix glycoproteins 
(Landolfo and Garotta, J. Immunol. Res. 3, 81-94 [1991]). Several animal experiments suggest that IFNγ plays a crucial role 
in either the induction or the progression of insulin-dependent 
diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, 
fulminant hepatitis, allograft rejection, thrombosis and hemorrhage 
that follows the generalized Shwartzman-type reaction. Additionally,  
 
IFNγ plays a role in the progression of Kawasaki disease 
(mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) and in the hypercalcemia 
observed in some of sarcoidosis patients (IFNγ induces the elevation of 
l,a-sterol-hydroxylase that converts vitamin D3 into its most active 
form 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) (Garotta et al., Pharmacol. Res. 21, 
5-17 [1989]; Landolfo and Garotta, supra; Gilles et al., Hepatology 16, 
655-663 [1992]). In the pathogenesis of AIDS, tissue macrophages 
play a role in the establishment of a state of chronic infection because 
they represent an important reservoir for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV). In vitro experiments show that IFNγ enhances the 
expression of mature HIV by infected macrophages and can 
exacerbate the progression of the disease (Ganser et al., Onkologie 9,
