<ABSTRACT>
The process according to the invention of laying and connecting floor elements (1) for optimising the improvement in footstep-soundproofing DELTA Lw is characterised in that adhesive strips (3, 5) are applied, over certain areas or over the entire surface area, in an alternating manner and in any sequence and in any shape, onto a horizontal underlying surface (2) using such mounting aids (4) that, upon subsequent laying of the individual floor elements (1) on the adhesive strips (3, 5) and by virtue of the subsequent pressing of said floor elements (1) onto the mounting aids (4), with corresponding deformation of the adhesive strips (3, 5), air cavities (6) of a defined height are produced between the underlying surface (2) and the connector floor elements (1).
