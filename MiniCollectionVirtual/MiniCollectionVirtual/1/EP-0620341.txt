<ABSTRACT>
A device for adapting a panic-safe lock to the opening 
direction of a door, for presetting the lock to open only 

from one side and for temporarily allowing to open it from 
the opposite side, comprising a pair of annular elements 

(3,4) rotatably supportable in the lock and having coaxial 
polygonal seats (9,10) for the side-fitting engagement of a 

respective handle, and threaded coaxial holes (11,12) 
parallel to the axis of the seats, the annular elements 

being able to rotate in contrast with elastic means from a 
fixed abutment position, a lever (15,16) which is pivoted 

between the annular elements coaxially thereto and has a 
slot (17,18) aligneable with the threaded holes and in 

which a screw (22) is inserted, the screw being screwed 
into one of the threaded holes and having such a length as 

to rotationally couple the lever (15,16) and the annular 
element in which the screw has been screwed, the other 

annular element being free, the lever having a first arm 
(23) for the actuation of the spring latch, a second arm 

(20) for the simultaneous actuation of the bolt, and a pawl 
(26) actuatable by means of the tumbler of a key-operated 

device and suitable to engage teeth of the annular elements 
to provide a rotational coupling between the lever and the 

annular elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a panic-safe lock comprising a device for adapting
the lock to the opening direction of a door, for
presetting the lock to open only from one side, and for
temporarily allowing to open it from the opposite side.Conventional panic-safe locks provided with a latch
and a bolt that can be moved into their release position by
actuating a handle are installed in emergency doors. With
these locks, in case of emergency the door can be opened
only from the inside outward.However, the need arises to install these locks in
emergency doors that open to the right or to the left and
to temporarily open the door from the outside as well.The technical aim of the present invention is to
provide a device which, when installed in a panic-safe
lock, renders it possible to open the door from one side and, only with
an appropriate actuation, from the opposite side.Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present
invention is to provide a device which is constructively
simple, highly reliable in operation and easy to modify
according to the rightward or leftward opening
characteristics of the door.The invention provides a panic-safe lock comprising a device for adapting
the lock to the opening direction of a door, for
presetting the lock to open only from one side and for
temporarily allowing to open it from the opposite side, 
with the features set forth in the characterizing part of claim 1.Further particularities of the present invention will
become apparent from the following description of a
preferred embodiment thereof, illustrated only by way of
non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings,
wherein:
figure 1 is a view of the device;figure 2 is an enlarged-scale view of the device;figure 3 is a sectional view, taken along the plane
III-III of figure 2;figure 4 is an exploded view of the device; andfigure 5 is a view of the lever alone.With reference to the above figures, the device 
comprises a bush 1 having a peripheral collar 2 on which
two annular elements 3 and 4 are centered on opposite
sides; said elements are substantially mirror images of
each other and make mutual contact at the centerline plane
P.The annular elements 3 and 4, termed simply "rings"
hereinafter for brevity, have on their outer faces
respective raised portions 3a, 4a by means of which they
are rotatably supportable in openings of the side walls of
a lock case. Each one of the rings 3 and 4 has two teeth
5, 6 and 7, 8 that lie diagonally opposite with respect to
the bush 1, a central seat 9, 10 and a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A panic-safe lock of the type comprising a spring
latch (32), a bolt (33), a key-operated device (36) with

a tumbler and a device for adapting the lock to the opening
direction of a door, for presetting said lock to open only

from one side and for temporarily allowing it to open from
the opposite side, 
characterized in that
 the device
comprises: a pair of annular elements (3, 4) rotatably

supported in the lock and biased in a set angular position
by elastic means, said annular elements (3, 4) having

coaxial polygonal seats (9, 10) for side-fitting engagement
of a respective handle and threaded coaxial holes (11, 12)

parallel to the axis of said seats; a lever (14) which is
pivoted between said annular elements (3, 4) coaxially

thereto, said lever (14) having an opening (17, 18)
aligneable with said threaded holes (11, 12), a first arm

(23) for the actuation of the spring latch (32), a second
arm (20) for the simultaneous actuation of the bolt (33),

and a pawl (26) actuatable by means of the tumbler of the
key-operated device (36), said pawl (26) being adapted to

engage teeth (6, 8) of said annular elements (3, 4) for
providing a rotational coupling between said lever (14) and

said annular elements (3, 4); and a screw (22) which is
insertable in said opening (17, 18), said screw being

screwable into one of said threaded holes (11, 12) and
having such a length as to rotationally couple said lever

(14) and the annular element (3, 4) in which said screw is
screwed while the other annular element is left free from

coupling.
A lock according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said lever (14) is constituted by a pair of adjacent rings

(15, 16), one of which (15) is provided with said first arm
(23) for the actuation of the spring latch (32) and the

other one (16) is provided with said second arm (20) for the
actuation of the bolt (33), respective openings (17, 18) for

the engagement of said screw being formed in said rings (15,
16).
A lock according to claim 2, characterized in that
said annular elements (3, 4) are rotatably supported on a

bush (1) and form a seat (13) in which said rings (15, 16)
are accommodated, the arms of said rings forming said lever

(14).
A lock according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in
that said ring (15) provided with said first arm (23) has a

tab (24) which is co-planar thereto and in which said pawl
(26) is articulated, a pin (27) being guided in said pawl

(26), a spring (29) acting on said pin, pushing it against
the edge of said ring (15) and keeping a tooth (31), formed

on said pawl (26), disengaged from corresponding teeth (6,
8) of the annular elements (3, 4), said pawl (26) being

actuatable by the tumbler of the key-operated device (36)
installed in the lock so as to move said teeth (6, 8) of

said annular elements and said tooth (31) of said pawl so
that they mutually mesh and rotationally couple said

annular element left free from coupling to said lever (14).
