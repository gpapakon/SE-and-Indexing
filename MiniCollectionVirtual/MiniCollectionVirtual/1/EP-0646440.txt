<ABSTRACT>
A robotic system for inserting cylinder liners (10) 
into the cylinder block (20) from an internal combustion 

engine includes an articulated robot arm (14) for cycling an 
end effector (16) between a dunnage (12) unloading position 

and a cylinder insertion position. The end effector (16), 
which is attached to the robot arm (14), picks liners (10) 

from dunnage (12) and places the liners (10) in the cylinder 
bores (22) of the cylinder block (20). The end effector 

(16) includes remotely deployable combination teeth (18) for 
gripping the liners to permit removal from their dunnage and 

for aligning the end effector (16) and liner (10) into the 
cylinder bores (22) to permit insertion of the liners.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a robotic system for
inserting cylinder liners into the cylinder bores of an
internal combustion cylinder block.Although some automotive engines having aluminium
cylinder blocks have been constructed without separate
liners in the cylinder bores, it is customary to provide
such liners, which are typically constructed of
centrifugally cast iron. Liners may be pressed in place or,
conventionally, the aluminium cylinder block is preheated
and, taking advantage of aluminium's high coefficient of
thermal expansion, an iron liner may be slipped into the
heated block such that once the aluminium has cooled to the
normal operating temperature of the block or below, the
liner is gripped tightly by the aluminium surrounding the
liner such that the liner cannot separate from the cylinder
block. Unfortunately, the insertion of an iron liner into a
heated aluminium cylinder block is frequently a difficult
proposition for a human engine assembly operator. The
liners must be inserted quickly and with one fluid motion,
inasmuch as heat transfer from the parent bore to the liner
will quickly cause the liner to expand and the aluminium to
cool to the point where the liner cannot be inserted. This
requires that the liner be positioned not only quickly,
smoothly, and in a continuous motion, but also without
cocking of the liner, which occurs when the centerline axis
of the liner and the centerline axis of the bore into which
it is being inserted are not collinear. If the liner
becomes cocked in the cylinder bore, it will not slide
completely into the bore because the liner will become
jammed as the heat from the cylinder block flows into the
liner, expanding the liner and causing a simultaneous
contraction of the aluminium cylinder block. An additional
drawback to the use of human production operators for
inserting liners resides in the face that the cylinder
blocks must be heated to well above 100@ centigrade and, as
a result, the liner installation area is quite uncomfortable 
for a human operator.The closest prior art document DE-A-3445849 discloses a robotic system
according to the preamble of claim 1, the robot having a
movable arm with a gripper. It is controlled by an optical
recognition system and by sensors on the gripper to
determine whether a correct grip is achieved. The
recognition system includes a television camera which guides
the gripper to the item to be gripped and a holder for the
gripper mounted on the arm allowing the gripper to engage at
a correct inclination identified by

<CLAIMS>
A robotic system for inserting cylinder liners (10) into
the cylinder block (20) of an internal combustion engine,

comprising:

an articulated robot arm (14) for cycling an end
effector (16) between a dunnage (12) unloading position and

a liner (10) insertion position;
the end effector (16) being attached to the
robot arm (14), for picking liners (10) from dunnage (12) at

the dunnage unloading position and for placing the liners
(10) into the cylinder bores (22) of the cylinder block (20)

at the liner insertion position;
characterized in that said end effector (16)

comprises remotely deployable combination teeth (18) for
gripping the interior of the liners (10) to permit removal

from their dunnage (12) and for contacting the cylinder
bores (22) so as to pilot the end effector (16) and liners

(10) into the cylinder bores (22) to permit insertion of the
liners.
A robotic system according to Claim 1, wherein said
end effector (16) is attached to said robot arm (14) by a

remotely controllable compliance device (28,32,34,35,38,40).
A robotic system according to Claim 2, wherein said
compliance device (28,32,34,35,38,40) is in a free position

when said end effector is picking liners (10) from dunnage
and when the end effector (16) is inserting the liners (10)

into the cylinder block, with said compliance device being
in a locked, non-compliant position when said robot arm (14)

is translating the end effector from the dunnage to the
cylinder block (20).
A robotic system according to Claim 3, wherein said
compliance device comprises an axially actuatable camming

slide (38,40). 
A robotic system according to Claim 1, wherein said
end effector comprises at least one generally cylindrical

body (42) with said remotely deployable combination teeth
(18) extending radially outwardly from the cylindrical

surface (42a) of said body (42).
A robotic system according to Claim 1, wherein said
end effector comprises a generally cylindrical body (42) for

each of the cylinders of a single bank of said cylinder
block (20) such that a plurality of cylinder liners (10) may

be inserted into said cylinder block (20) simultaneously.
