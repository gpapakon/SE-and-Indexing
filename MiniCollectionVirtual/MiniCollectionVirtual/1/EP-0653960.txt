<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic stirrer wherein a relatively weakly magnetised disposable stirrer bar (14) inside a closed container (10), for example a stirrer bar moulded wholly of non-isotropic ferrite, is moved with a stirring action from outside the container by a relatively powerful magnetic driver (16), preferably consisting of a pair of permanent magnets (18, 20) of neodymium boron driven in rotation as an assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a magnetic stirring system and in particular to a magnetic 
stirrer and a method of magnetically stirring a liquid within a closed culture bottle. Magnetic stirring of liquids within a closed bottle is a well known technique. A stirrer bar 
in the liquid to be stirred is moved with a stirring action by a magnetic field producing means 
outside the bottle. The magnetic field producing means outside the bottle may be motor 
driven magnets or solid state switched coils The stirrer bar normally used hitherto in such 
systems is of relatively high quality, being strongly magnetised and costly to manufacture. 
Accordingly, it is normal to recover the stirrer bar after use and wash it for further use. Known from German Specification No. 1 757 099 is a magnetic stirring means for a bank 
of test tubes. Non-permanent magnet stirrer bars are driven in unspecified motion 
by an external permanent magnetic means driven in rotation. Also known from U.S. Patent 
No. 4 090 263 is a magnetic stirrer system in which a magnetisable stirrer bar is coupled to 
an external drive magnet. There are applications for magnetic stirrers, such as the stirring of cultures in microbiology, 
where the fluid is often extremely hazardous and recovery of stirrer bars would require 
protected sterilisation. In such circumstances, removal of the stirrer bar from the culture 
bottle would be a very undesirable process. Furthermore, culture bottles are themselves 
a disposable product, and must be of cheap manufacture. The incorporation of expensive 
stirrer bars in such bottles has therefore not been considered a practicable procedure, so that 
magnetic stirring has not been considered possible in this field of application.  
 According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a magnetic stirrer comprising a 
closed culture bottle for containing liquid, the bottle containing a stirrer bar in the form of 
a relatively low power, lost cost disposable magnet extending parallel to the bottle base to 
establish opposite poles at opposite ends of the bar on opposite sides of the centre axis of the 
bottle through the bottle base, and a permanent magnet means located centrally beneath the 
bottle base in close proximity thereto and comprising a pair of spaced, relatively high power 
magnets providing spaced opposite poles in a plane parallel to the length of the stirrer bar 
in close proximity to opposite ends of the stirrer bar, and driving means for 
continuously rotating the external permanent

A magnetic stirrer comprising a closed culture bottle (10) for containing liquid (12), the 
bottle containing a stirrer bar (14) in the form of a relatively low power, low cost disposable 

magnet extending parallel to the bottle base to establish opposite poles at opposite ends of 
the bar on opposite sides of the centre axis of the bottle through the bottle base, and a 

permanent magnet means (16) located centrally beneath the bottle base in close proximity 
thereto and comprising a pair of spaced, relatively high power magnets (18, 20) providing 

spaced opposite poles in a plane parallel to the length of the stirrer bar in close 
proximity to opposite ends of the stirrer bar, and driving means for continuously rotating the 

external permanent magnet means about the centre axis of the bottle so that its rotating strong 
magnetic field aligns with that of the stirrer bar and entrains the stirrer bar in continuous 

rotation in a plane parallel to and above the bottle base within the liquid in the bottle. 
A stirrer as claimed in claim 1, wherein the stirrer bar is moulded wholly of ferrite in 
non-isotropic form. 
A stirrer as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the permanent magnet means comprises 
at least one relatively powerful rare earth magnet. 
A stirrer as claimed in claim 3, wherein the at least one relatively powerful magnet is 
made of neodymium boron. 
A method of magnetically stirring a liquid within a closed culture bottle, wherein a low 
cost disposable stirrer bar of relatively low power magnetisation establishing opposite poles 

at opposite ends of the bar is inserted into the bottle to extend parallel to the bottle base 
across the centre axis of the bottle, a permanent magnet means of relatively high power 

providing spaced opposite poles in a plane parallel to the length of the stirrer bar and in close 
proximity to opposite ends of the stirrer bar is continuously driven in rotation beneath 

the bottle base in close proximity thereto and about the centre axis of the bottle, causing its 
rotating strong magnetic field to align with that of the stirrer bar and thereby entrain the  

 
stirrer bar in continuous rotation in a plane parallel to and above the bottle base within the 

liquid in the container. 
A method as claimed in claim 5, applied to the stirring of a hazardous liquid in a 
disposable bottle. 
A magnetic stirrer comprising a closed culture bottle (10) for receiving a liquid culture 
(12), a relatively low power, low cost disposable magnet constituting a stirrer bar (14) within the 

bottle, said stirrer bar being moulded of non-isotropic ferrite, 
a relatively high power permanent magnetic means (16) 

outside the bottle and arranged in close proximity relative to the stirrer bar for entraining the stirrer bar in 
continuous rotation about the centre axis of the bottle and above the bottle base within the 

liquid culture, and driving means for the permanent magnet means. 
A magnetic stirrer according to claim 7, applied to a culture bottle for containing a blood 
culture. 
A method of magnetically stirring a liquid culture within a closed culture bottle, wherein 

a low cost disposable stirrer bar of relatively low power magnetisation is located in the 
bottle, said stirrer bar being made of non-isotropic ferrite, and a relatively high power 

permanent magnet means is located outside the bottle in close proximity relative to the 
stirrer bar and energised to drive the stirrer bar in continuous rotation about the centre 

axis of the bottle and above the bottle base within the liquid culture. 
A method according to claim 9, wherein the liquid culture is a blood culture.
