<ABSTRACT>
A wheel chock for passenger cars or the like is shown and described, which has an essentially flat ground surface and a curved tyre contact surface. In order to obtain a low-cost non-skid wheel chock, which can be conveniently carried and handled, it is proposed, that the wheel chock be divided into a lower chock (4) containing the ground surface (1) and an upper chock (5) containing the tyre contact surface (2), that the upper and lower chocks (4, 5) are approximately the same size and on their bearing sides (6, 8) mesh in one another with corresponding pin projections (7) and pin receivers (9) and that it be possible to fit the lower chock (4) and the upper chock (5) together to form a flat, approximately trapezoidal configuration in a storage position turned through 180@ in relation to the position of use.

Ramp block for passenger cars or the like, which has an 
e.g. plane bottom surface and a curved tyre ramp surface, 

characterised in that the ramp block is divided into a 
lower block (4, 34) comprising the bottom surface (1) and 

an upper block (5, 33) comprising the ramp surface (2), in 
that the lower and upper blocks (4, 34; 5, 33) are of 

approximately equal size and on their contact sides (6, 51; 
8, 52) interlock with corresponding projections (7, 54) and 

receptacles (9, 53), and in that the lower block (4, 34) 
and the upper block (5, 33) in a secure position turned 

through 180Â° relative to the working position can be fitted 
together into a flat, more or less trapezoidal structure. 
Ramp block according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the lower block (4) and the upper block (5) are made of 

plastic and in that the bottom surface (1) and the ramp 
surface (2) are designed as apertured grids. 
Ramp block according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the lower and upper blocks (4, 5) in the secure 

position are traversed by a bolt (10), for screw connection 
to a support (11). 
Ramp block according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the head (12) of the bolt (10) is held in countersunk 

fashion in a recess (13) of the upper block (5, 33). 
Ramp block according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that inside the upper block (5) is arranged a supporting 

block (14) for the head (12) of the bolt (10), of which the 
upper side (15) in the secure position lies parallel to the 

bottom surface (1) of the lower block (4). 
Ramp block according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the upper block (5) on its contact side (6) comprises  

 
four projections (7) of elongate cross-section which are 

arranged at the corners of a rectangle and which are 
oriented with their cross-sectional longitudinal extent 

parallel to each other and with which are associated 
corresponding receptacles (9) on the contact side (8) of 

the lower block (4). 
Ramp block according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the lower and upper blocks (4, 34; 5, 

33) are constructed as boxes which are in each case 
stiffened by a plurality of intersecting longitudinal and 

transverse walls (20, 21; 22, 23) which form the apertured 
grids on the bottom and ramp surfaces (1, 2), wherein the 

points of intersection of longitudinal and transverse walls 
are reinforced by rounded corner struts (24). 
Ramp block according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the central longitudinal region of the boxes is free from 

longitudinal walls (20, 21) and in that the grid apertures 
of the rows of apertures (28, 32) in this central 

longitudinal region are substantially larger than the grid 
apertures of the rows of apertures (25, 29, 30, 31) in the 

outer regions. 
Ramp block according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the apertured grid of the ramp surface (2) in the outer 

longitudinal regions comprises several longitudinal rows of 
apertures (25) in which oblong apertures (26) and round 

apertures (27) of in each case the same width alternate 
with each other. 
Ramp block according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the apertured grid of the bottom surface (1) comprises 

several longitudinal rows of apertures, wherein the width 
of the apertures within a row of apertures (29, 30, 31, 32) 

is in each case the same and the apertures of adjacent rows 
of apertures (29/30; 30/31; 31/32) have a greatly different  

 
aperture width. 
Ramp block according to claim 10, characterised in that 
the rows of apertures (29) with the narrowest aperture 

widths are located on the outside. 
Ramp block according to one or more of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the lower block (34) on its high 

wedge side (35) comprises two corner feet (36, 37) which 
project beyond its bottom surface (38). 
Ramp block according to claim 12, characterised in that 
the lower block (34) on the bottom side between its corner 

feet (36, 37) is provided with a flat arcuate recess (39) 
with a depth of a few millimetres. 
Ramp block according to claims 12 and 13, characterised 
in that the ramp block (33, 34) in the region of its corner 

feet is provided with material reinforcements (43 to 50) 
projecting beyond its high wedge sides (40, 35) and/or its 

longitudinal sides (41, 42). 
Ramp block according to one or more of claims 1 to 14, 
characterised in that the upper block (33) and the lower 

block (34) on their contact sides (51, 52) in their central 
region are provided with a coupling system which interlocks 

over a large area and of which the transverse dimensions 
are larger than half the transverse dimensions of the ramp 

block. 
Ramp block according to claim 15, characterised in that 
in the upper block (33) is provided a circular receptacle 

(53) for one or more rounded pins (54) which are formed 
integrally on the lower block (34) and which are provided 

with radial anti-twist attachments (55) with which are 
associated corresponding receptacles (56) in the upper 

block (33).  
 
Ramp block according to one or more of claims 1 to 16, 
characterised in that the upper block (33) and the lower 

block (34) are held together by a releasable snap-fit 
connection (57) in the working position and in the secure 

position. 
Ramp block according to claim 17, characterised in that 
between upper block (33) and lower block (34) is arranged 

an outwardly opening flat recess (59) on the lower block 
(34) for applying a lever-off tool, e.g. even a coin.
