<ABSTRACT>
A surgical retractor (10) having a plurality of widenable and narrowable blades (24, 26, 28) of substantial width, having tissue-contacting surfaces that are not significantly narrower, in a collapsed position, than a guide tube (13) for guiding the retractor blades through a surgical access port to a surgical site during a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Each retractor blade (24, 26, 28) includes a relatively large, preferably planar, tissue-cntacting surface for displacing or repositioning internal body tissue, such as an internal organ, for temporary displacement away from the surgical site. After insertion through a surgical access port one or more of the retractor blades (24, 26, 28) can be widened laterally to substantially space distal ends (56, 58, 60) of the retractor blades apart for maximum contact against and over a substantial area of the tissue to be displaced during the surgical procedure. After completion of the operative procedure, the retractor blades (24, 26, 28) can be narrowed by nesting the blades together and the retractor (10) can be easily and safely withdrawn from the access port.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SURGICAL RETRACTOR AND SURGICAL METHODFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to a surgical detractor that is capable of being narrowed for percutaneous insertion through a surgical access port and directed to a surgical site where it can be remotely widened and narrowed for moving internal tissue, such as a body organ, for improved observation of and an unobstructed surgical field. More particularly, the present invention is directed to an widenable and narrowable laparoscopic surgical retractor that is sufficiently narrow for insertion through a surgical access port when a plurality of spreadable retractor blades are in a narrowed position, and that includes a linkage mechanism for spreading or narrowing the retractor blades at the surgical site.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ARTThe advantages of minimally invasive percutaneous, endoscopic surgical procedures are well documented.The use of widenable and narrowable surgical devices, including dilation devices, blood vessel widening devices, grasping forceps and laparoscopic retractors are also known in the prior art as shown in 

25 the Groth U.S. Patent No. 430,849; Graham U.S. PatentNo. 1,328,624; Suma U.S. Patent No. 4,654,028; Taguchi et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,909,789; Genese U.S. Patent No. 4,994,079; and Santos U.S. Patent No. 4,648,402.The utilization of known prior art percutaneous, laparoscopic surgical retractors through an access port during minimally invasive surgery is difficult and requires precise, safe contact of tissue at a critical area for repositioning the tissue away from the surgical site, particularly when the retractor blades are formed from relatively thin material, such as metal wires. This disadvantage and others are overcome in the present invention by providing a surgical retractor which includes a plurality of spreadable and narrowable retractor blades that each includes a tissue-contacting planar surface that is substantially wider than prior art laparoscopic surgical retractor tissue-contacting surfaces, yet the retractor is capable of fitting through a conventional access port into a body cavity.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to a laparoscopic surgical retractor having a plurality of spreadable and narrowable blades of substantial width, having main tissue-contacting surfaces that are not significantly narrower, in a narrowed position, than the inner diameter of a guide tube that guides the retractor blades through a surgical access port to a surgical site during a

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS;
1. A surgical retractor comprising:
an elongate guide member having proximal and distal ends and a longitudinal axis;
at least two retractor blades movably connected to a distal end of the guide member;
an actuator;
first linkage means extending along the guide member for interconnecting each retractor blade with the actuator wherein the actuator is disposed adjacent the proximal end of the guide member and wherein the actuator and the first linkage means are longitudinally movable relative to the guide member along a path parallel to the longitudinal axis thereof; and
second linkage means coupled to the guide member for affording sliding angular relative movement of the retractor blades in response to longitudinal movement of the actuator and the first linkage.
2. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim
1, wherein the retractor blade s each include a main planar surface portion and an integral surface portion angularly disposed with respect to the main portion.
3. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim
2, wherein the integral portion of each retractor blade is substantially planar.

4. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim
3, wherein the main portion of each retractor blade extends in a plane transverse to the plane of the integral portion.
5. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim
4, wherein the integral portion is disposed at a distal end of the main portion of each retractor blade.
6. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim 1, wherein the first linkage means comprises an elongate, rigid connecting rod connecting a proximal end of each retractor blade to the actuator.
7. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim 1, wherein each retractor blade includes an elongate slot extending therethrough intermediate the proximal end and a distal end thereof, and wherein said second linkage means comprises a pin secured to the distal end of the guide member and extending through the slots in the retractor blades.
8. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim 7 including three retractor blades.
9. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim 8, wherein the slot in one of the retractor blades is disposed in longitudinal alignment with the longitudinal axis of the guide member and wherein the slots in remaining retractor blades are angularly disposed with respect to the longitudinal axis of the guide member, so that axial movement of the first 


linkage means retains the one retractor blade in longitudinal alignment with the guide member and causes the remaining retractor blades to spread outwardly at their distal ends.
10. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim
9, wherein each slot in each remaining retractor blade is disposed at an angle of from about 5° to about 25° from the longitudinal axis of each remaining retractor blade.
11. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim
10, wherein each slot in each remaining retractor blade is disposed at an angle of from about 10" to about 20° from the longitudinal axis of each remaining retractor blade.
12. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim
11, wherein each slot in each remaining retractor blade is disposed at an angle of from about 10° to about 15° from the longitudinal axis of each remaining retractor blade.
13. A surgical retractor as defined in Claim 1, wherein longitudinal movement of the actuator affords simultaneous longitudinal movement and sliding angular relative movement of the retractor blades.
14. A surgical method of moving internal body tissue to access a surgical site within a patient during a minimally invasive surgical procedure comprising:
inserting a hollow tube into the patient's body through a small access port formed in the patient's skin; 


 inserting a narrowable surgical retractor including a plurality of elongate tissue- contacting blades in a narrowed condition into the patient's body through the hollow tube along a first longitudinal axis;
subsequently widening said blades within the patient's body by extending at least one blade laterally with respect to another blade by means of a pin and slot linkage, said linkage including an elongate slot formed in said one blade at an angle to said first axis;
contacting said body tissue with said widened blades; and
moving said body tissue away from said surgical site by operation of a control mechanism from outside of the patient's body.
15. A surgical method as defined in Claim 14, wherein the body tissue is contacted with the retractor blades at planar tissue-contacting surfaces of said retractor blades.
16. A surgical method as defined in Claim 14, including widening three tissue contacting blades by rotation of a distal end of two of said blades causing angular movement of said rotated blades relative to a third blade about a common axis.
17. A surgical method as defined in Claim 14, wherein said widening step includes moving said blades longitudinally along said first axis while simultaneously effecting said lateral extension of said one blade with respect to said another blade.
