<ABSTRACT>
A power branch/combiner which branches high-frequency 
wide-band power into two or greater prime number N of ways 

or for combining high-frequency wide-band power from N ways 
and which is free from interference by a difference in the 

power to N inputs and is simple-structured. Unbalance 
absorbing resistors (R₁ to R
N
) connected together at one 
end are connected at the other end to respective 

individual ports (1 to N) and wide-band individual 
transformers (T₁ to T
N
).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power branch/combiner 
for use in telecommunication facilities and, more 
particularly, to a power branch/combiner for branching 
high-frequency power of the microwave band into a plurality 
of ways in in-phase relation over a wide band or combining 
power from a plurality of systems. In general, a high-frequency power branch/combiner is a 
hybrid circuit composed of a transmission line typed wide-band 
transformer and a resistor, and a wide-band power two-way 
branching/combining circuit shown in Fig. 3 of the 
accompanying drawings or a wide-band power three-way 
branching/combining circuit is used as an elementary 
circuit; wide-band power branch/combiners are mostly 
formed by a parallel or cascade connection of such circuits. With the above-mentioned circuits, however, it is 
possible to implement branching power into a prime number 
of ways equal to or greater than 5, such as 5, 7, 11, 13, 
... and combining power therefrom; it is necessary to 
employ a branching/combining circuit corresponding to each 
prime number. Among others, a wide-band power five-way 
branching/combining circuit permits branching power into 
numbers which have a factor of 5, such as 10, 15, 20, ..., 
100, ..., and combining power from such plural ways, and it 
has become particularly important in recent years of highly 
developed multiplex communication. As a wide-band power branching/combining circuit for 
branching power into a prime number of ways equal to or 
greater than 5 and combining power therefrom, there has  
 
been proposed a developed version of the three-way branch/combiner 
circuit depicted in Fig. 4 of the accompanying 
drawings. An example is shown in Fig. 5 of the accompanying drawings. In Fig. 5, reference numerals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 denote 
individual ports, 6 a common port, T₁ through T₅ wide-band 
individual port transformers, 7 an individual port winding 
of the transformer T₁, 8 a common port winding of the 
transformer T₁, 8 a comon port winding of the transformer 
T₁ and R₁ through R₅ unbalance absorbing resistors. This circuit can generally be represented by an 
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6A. It is important, in 
this circuit, that when the load impedance connected to the 
common port 6 or internal impedance of a signal source is 
Z/5, the input impedance or internal impedance of each of 
the individual ports 1 through 5 is Z and the individual 
ports are each isolated and free from interference from the 
others. In the circuit of Fig. 5, however, the
