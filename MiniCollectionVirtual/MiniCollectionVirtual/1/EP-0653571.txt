<ABSTRACT>
The sheet metal nut serves for blind fastening in a hole of a carrier plate and comprises a head plate (1) for bearing on the border of a through-passage hole (11) in the carrier plate (12) and having a clearance (14) for the through-passage of a screw (20), and further comprises a threaded sleeve (3) which is arranged at a distance from the head plate (1) and is connected to the head plate (1) by connecting webs (4) which can be pivoted outwards. In order to be able to produce the sheet metal nut in a cost-effective manner, the threaded sleeve (3) is formed in one piece with the head plate (1) and the connecting webs (4) using an elongate plate, the head plate (1), which overlaps the through-passage hole (11), being formed from two halves (1', 1'') which are integrally formed at the ends of the connecting webs (4) and are brought together after inwards and outwards bending of the connecting webs (4).

A sheet metal nut for blind fastening in a hole in a carrier 
plate, comprising a head plate (1) for resting on the edge of a through 

hole (11) in the carrier plate (12) having an opening (14) for a screw 
(12) to pass therethrough and a screwthreaded sleeve portion (3) which 

is arranged at a spacing from the head plate (1) and which is connected 
to the head plate (1) by outwardly foldable connecting limbs (4), 

wherein the head plate (1) which covers over the through hole (11) 

comprises a plurality of parts (1', 1") which are formed on the ends of 
the connecting limbs (4) and are brought together after inward and 

outward folding of the connecting limbs (4), characterised in that the 
screwthreaded sleeve portion (3) is formed in one piece with the head 

plate (1) and the connecting limbs (4) from an elongated plate and the 
head plate (1) comprises two halves (1', 1"). 
A sheet metal nut according to claim 1 characterised in that 
lugs (9, 10) are formed on the head plate halves (1', 1") at both sides 

of the longitudinal edges (7, 8) and are bent towards the screwthreaded 
sleeve portion (3) in such a way that said lugs (9, 10) can engage into 

the hole (11) in the carrier plate (12) and bear against the hole edge 
(13). 
A sheet metal nut according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised 
in that each half of the head plate is connected to the screwthreaded 

sleeve portion by respective two connecting limbs (4) and the opening 
(14) for the screw to pass therethrough is disposed at the end of the 

intermediate space (15) between the two connecting limbs (4). 
A sheet metal nut according to claim 2 characterised in that 
projecting from the base plate (2) of the screwthreaded sleeve portion  

 
(3) transversely to the longitudinal direction are two support lugs (16) 

which, when the screwthreaded sleeve portion (3) is tightened, bear 
against the ends of the connecting limbs (4) which are bent away at the 

head plate (1).
