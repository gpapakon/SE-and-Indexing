A machine for handling strips (10) of material in 
order to remove them, the said machine consisting of 

means (100) for feeding the said strips (10) forward and 
cutting them into calibrated pieces, followed by means 

(200, 201) for catching the said pieces of material 
strips, characterised in that the feeding means are 

designed to move the strips forward in steps and the 
cutting means are designed to cut the strips into 

calibrated pieces in synchronisation with the feed-pitch 
of the machine, the said stepper feeder and cutting means 

consisting of : 

a motor element (110 designed to apply a reciprocating 
motion (F1) to a driving rod (111), 
a control rod (120) integral with the driving rod 
(111), 
a gear wheel (130) with a freewheel (131) driven by the 
control rod (120), 
a guide roller (140) for moving the strips (10) of 
material forward, integral with the freewheel (131) so as 

to move the said strips forward during a first stroke of 

the reciprocating movement (F1) of the driving rod (111), 
a counter-roller (150) to which a return force (F2) is 
applied in the direction of the forward roller (140) so 

as to press the strips (10) of material against the said 
forward roller, 
a blade-holder tool (160) integral with the control rod 
(120) and a fixed counter-blade (170), the blade-holder 

tool being designed to cut the strips (10) of material 
into calibrated pieces during a second stroke of the 

reciprocating movement (F1) of the driving rod, at which 
point the forward roller (140) is held by means of the 

freewheel (131) of the gear wheel (130). 
A machine as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that  
 

the blade-holder tool (160) is provided with a presser 
foot (162) mounted on at least one spring (163), designed 

to keep the strips (10) of material pressed against the 
counter-blade (170) whilst the said strips are being cut 

and until the blade-holder tool (160) has been fully 
released. 
A machine as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the said machine also has means 

(300) for regulating the degree to which the strips (10) 
of material penetrate the step-feeder and cutter means 

(100). 
A machine as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that 
the said feed regulating means consist of a first fixed 

pulley (301), a mobile pulley (302) and a second fixed 
pulley (303), whereby a force (F3) is applied to the 

mobile pulley to tauten the strips (10) of material so 
that the excess strip lengths from upstream of the 

machine are taken up. 
A machine as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that 
the mobile pulley has a position at which the strips (10) 

of material are wound at minimum length, registered by a 
power switch (K1) of the motor element (110) of the 

machine. 
A machine as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterised in that the mobile pulley (302) has a 

position of maximum travel, registered by an alarm switch 
(K2). 
A machine as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the means for catching the pieces 

of calibrated strips in time with the machine pitch 
consist of an outlet tube (200) and a container (201) 

into which the said outlet tube opens. 
A machine as claimed in one of claims 3 to 7, 
characterised in that a mobile plate (410) integral with 

the blade-holder tool (160) allows a catchment volume  
 

(400) for the pieces of strip to be isolated and sealed 
when the said blade-holder stops in the lower position 

when subjected to the action of the said regulating means 
(300). 
Plant consisting of a plurality of machines as claimed 
in any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that each 

machine is provided with an outlet catchment tube, the 
said plant having a collector tube for the outlet tubes 

and means for forcing the pieces of calibrated strip to 
circulate with the forward pitch of the machine from the 

outlet tubes to a container into which the collector tube 
opens. 
Application of the machine as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 8 or the plant as claimed in claim 9 to 

vacuum thermo-forming machinery as used in the agri-food 
industry.
