<ABSTRACT>
In a spark plug having a nickel-based electrode 
whose front end has a firing tip made from a ruthenium- or 

iridium-based metal in which an oxide of a rare earth 
metal group is dispersed, the firing tip is welded to the 

electrode by a solidified alloy layer having a component 
of the electrode and a component of the firing tip. The 

firing tip contains the oxide of the rare earth metal 
group in a range of 5 ∼ 15 % by volume (V), and an 

average grain size (D) of the oxide is in a range of 0.05 
∼ 3.0 µm with a quantitative relationship as D ≦ -0.34V + 

5.1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a spark plug having an electrode 
whose front end has a spark-erosion resistant tip made, for 
example, from a ruthenium- or iridium-based metal in which an 
oxide of a rare earth metal group is dispersed. A spark plug electrode may use a firing tip which is made 
from a high melting point metal such as ruthenium or iridium or 
the like. In the metal, an oxide (e.g. yttria) of a rare earth 
metal group is dispersed in order to improve spark-erosion 
resistance, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 52-118137. In the spark plug disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication 
No.2-49388, a firing tip is secured to a front end of a nickel-based 
electrode by means of laser or electron beam welding. The 
firing tip is made of an iridium-based metal containing platinum 
at less than 50% by weight. Futhermore, JP-A-5054953 discloses a spark plug, according to the preamble 
of claim 1. In laser or electron beam welding, the local application of 
thermal energy of the firing tip and front end of the electrode 
causes a solidified alloy layer to form therebetween. In this 
instance, the oxide of the rare earth metal group tends to 
coagulate or segregate in the solidified alloy layer and so blow 
holes appear. This tendency increases as the oxide in the firing 
tip increases.  
 Thermal stress around these blow holes causes cracks to 
develop in the solidified alloy layer due to the cycles of 
heating and cooling when the spark plug electrode is used in an 
internal combustion engine. In the worst case, the cracks 
eventually result in the firing tip exfoliating or falling from 
the front end of the electrode, thereby significantly shortening 
the service life of the spark plug. In order to avoid the exfoliation of the firing tip, it 
would be possible to decrease the amount of the oxide of the rare 
earth metal group. However, a decrease in the amount of the 
oxide results in the firing tip's spark-erosion resistance 
declining. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided a spark plug having an electrode of a first metal, whose 
front end has a firing tip made from a second, high melting point 
metal in which an oxide of a rare earth group metal is dispersed; 
wherein 
   the firing tip is welded to the electrode by a solidified 
alloy layer having a component from the electrode and a component 
from the firing tip; and 
   characterised in that the firing tip contains V% by volume 
of the oxide of the rare earth group metal, where V is a number 
in the
