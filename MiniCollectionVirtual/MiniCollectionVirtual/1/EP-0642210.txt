<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a super high 
speed brushless DC motor, and more particularly, relates 
to a super high speed brushless DC motor which includes 
an armature which is constructed by winding an armature 
winding to an armature core, and a rotor constructed by 
providing a rotor core having interior faces consisting 
of permanent magnets, which rotor rotates at greater 
than 10,000 r.p.m.. Traditionally, a motor can be used as a driving 
source for a compressor, or the like, due to advantages 
such as ease of electrical control. A motor includes 
various species, but a three-phase induction motor is 
most commonly used in the applications presently 
contemplated because of advantages such as a rotating  
 
magnetic field's being easily obtained using three-phase 
alternating power source, thus making commutators 
unnecessary, and that a three-phase induction motor is 
steady, inexpensive, and is easy to deal with. In an 
induction motor, an armature winding is wound to an 
armature core and a rotor winding is wound to a rotor 
core. Current flows not only in the armature winding, 
but also in the rotor winding. Therefore, output can 
decrease due to secondary copper loss caused by current 
flowing in the rotor winding and efficiency of the 
induction motor cannot be significantly raised even when 
no mechanical losses exist. In view of this consideration, a brushless DC 
motor is proposed in which permanent magnets are mounted 
to a rotor core rather than winding a rotor winding to 
the rotor core, so as to minimize secondary copper 
losses while providing high driving efficiency. 
Further, it is contemplated that a brushless DC motor is 
to be applied as a high speed motor in a precision 
machine, compressor or the like, because a brushless DC 
motor can perform with high driving efficiency. In the 
present case, a brushless DC motor is contemplated with 
a focus toward raising driving efficiency. An air gap 
length between a stator and a core is designed to be 
about 1/100 ∼ 1/200 of an inside diameter of the stator  
 
so as to raise coupling efficiency of magnetic flux 
between the stator and the rotor. Further, a metallic 
tube is provided so as to prevent breakage of permanent 
magnets during high speed rotation (refer to an Offician 
Gazzett of Tokukaihei 3-11950). When a brushless DC motor is rotated at high 
speed, a variation in magnetic flux density ocurrs 
caused by slots in the stator. Although the gap length 
is extremely small as described above, the rotor is 
greatly
