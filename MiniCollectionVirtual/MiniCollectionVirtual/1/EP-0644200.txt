<ABSTRACT>
A transformant is prepared by introducing into a coryneform a DNA fragment containing a gene coding for a 
novel cell cortex protein originating in 
Brevibacterium lactofermentum
 and having the following two sequences in its 
molcule and a molecular weight of about 63,000 D: 


This transformant or a strain deficient in the novel cell cortex protein, which has been 
newly prepared, is used for producing valuable substances including L-amino acids by the L-amino acid fermentation 

method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns breeding of microorganisms
useful for production of useful substances such as L-amino
acids by fermentation processes and methods for producing
useful substances such as L-amino acids by fermentation
processes using the above-mentioned microorganisms. More
specifically, it relates to a novel cell surface layer
protein derived from Brevibacteriumlactofermentum, a DNA
segment containing a gene coding for the protein and an
application use thereof.Coryneform bacteria are microorganisms producing L-amino
acids such as L-glutamic acid or L-lysin in a great amount,
and breeding of them has been conducted with an aim of
improving the productivity of L-amino acids. Various studies
have been made and reported so far for breeding of amino
acid-producing bacteria using gene manipulation technology
(Biotechnology letters, 2 (1980) 525 - 530, Appln. Environ.
Microbiol., 144 (1979) 181 - 190, Abstract of Lecture for the
Meeting of the Society of Agricultural Chemistry of Japan
(1981) 8). However, all of them have been directed to the
improvement of the productivity of the aimed amino acid per cell
by utilizing genes in amino acid biosynthetic systems as
materials and enhancing them and not directed to the 
improvement of the productivity by analyzing the function of
a cell surface structure.By the way, when an amino acid is produced by a
fermentation process, ion exchange chromatography has usually
been conducted in the course of purifying a produced amino
acid but, if bacterial cells remain in a fermentation medium,
an ion exchange resin column is clogged when the fermentation
medium is passed through the column and, accordingly, a step
of removing the bacterial cells from the fermentation medium
is necessary. The step is usually conducted by
centrifugation, filtration or the like and it will be
extremely useful industrially if such cell separating
operation can be saved or simplified.It has been known that microbial cells are precipitated
in the medium due to aggregation or the like after
cultivation depending on the kind of microorganisms and
separation of the cells from a culture medium is extremely
easy for such microorganisms. However, no Coryneform
bacteria used in amino acid production, having such a
property have yet been reported and a method of providing
microbial cells with aggregating or precipitating property
has not yet been known as well.The published pamphlet of WO 93/03158 discloses a
novel cell surface layer protein similar to a K-protein of
the present invention, but
