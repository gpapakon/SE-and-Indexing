<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of long-chain inulin with simultaneous isolation of glucose and fructose, where an aqueous crude inulin suspension with a crude inulin concentration of 20 - 70% by weight is treated enzymatically with hydrolases at temperatures of 30 - 70@C, whereupon the short-chain fractions are degraded to mono- and disaccharides and the long-chain inulins are separated from the mono- and disaccharides and converted into the dry form, to the products prepared in this way and to the use thereof.

Method for the preparation of long-chain 
inulin while simultaneously obtaining glucose and 

fructose, characterized in that an aqueous crude inulin 
suspension with a crude inulin concentration of 

20 - 70% by weight is treated enzymatically with 
hydrolases at temperatures of 30 - 70°C, with the 

short-chain components being broken down into 
monosaccharides and disaccharides, and with the long-chain 

inulins being substantially free of molecules 
with a degree of polymerization 
<
 10 - 12 and being 
separated from the monosaccharides and disaccharides 

and being converted into a dry form. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the crude inulin concentration amounts to 40 - 50% 

by weight. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the crude inulin suspension is 

heated before the enzymatic treatment to 80 - 95°C, is 
then tempered to 30 - 70°C and during the enzymatic 

treatment is kept constant at a temperature between 30 
and 70°C. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that the enzymatic treatment of the 

crude inulin suspension is carried out with hydrolases 
such as inulinases, exo-inulinases or β-invertases or 

mixtures thereof at temperatures and pH-values suitable 
for the enzyme. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that the enzymatic treatment in 

dependence upon the enzyme dosage is ended after a 
reaction time of 2 - 48 h by increasing the pH-value to 

8.0 to 9.0 or heating the mixture to 90 - 100°C. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that the long-chain inulin is isolated 

from the reaction solution by cooling crystallization  
 

and centrifugation and is converted into a dry form in 
accordance with methods known in themselves. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that the inulin suspension obtained is 

converted by heating into a clear solution and is 
chromatographically separated by way of Ca
2+
-loaded, 
greatly acidic cationic exchange resins into 


a pure fructose fraction, 
a glucose/fructose mixed fraction and 
a long-chain inulin fraction, 
 
and in that the fraction with long-chain inulin is 

converted into a dry form in accordance with methods 
known in themselves. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that the suspension obtained is 

released by dilution and is separated by way of 
ultrafiltration into a monosaccharide and disaccharide 

fraction and a long-chain inulin fraction, and in that 
the fraction with long-chain inulin is converted into a 

dry form according to methods known in themselves. 
Long-chain inulin with an average chain length 
of more than 20, which is substantially free of 

saccharides with a chain length below 10. 
Use of inulins according to claim 9 in food, 
dietary agents and as carriers of medicines.
