<DESCRIPTION>
 LOW-FAT EDIBLE POURABLE PRODUCT AND A PROCESS AND A COMPOSITION FOR PREPARING SAMEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to low-fat edible pourable 5 products and to a process and a composition for preparing such products.TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ARTIn the food consumer market an increasing demand for ready- made pourable products such as sauces, soups, salad dressings10 or dips is noted. However, many of these products presently available have a fat content which is in the range of 10- 50 wt%, or even higher. With the generally increasing awareness amongst consumers to reduce intake of fat in the daily diet, a need exists to provide such products with a15 reduced fat content.One commonly desired feature of ready-made sauces, soups, salad dressing or dips is a degree of viscosity which confers to the products a desired creamy consistency whereby the products become conveniently pourable also at a temperature 20 in the range of 0-30°C and which, when the product is ingested, gives the consumer a sensory feeling of "richness" or "body" without any stickiness.In order to obtain the above-mentioned viscosity charac¬ teristics, presently available pourable food products contain 25 conventional thickening and viscosity enhancing ingredients, ' and fat which may typically be in the form of butter, margarine or dairy cream. As a typical example, a ready-made bearnaise sauce having a fat content of 20.0 wt% may comprise the following ingredients: water 59.7 wt%, margarine 30 24.2 wt%, dairy cream (13 wt% fat) 5.0 wt%, mixture of thickening agents 8.1 wt% and flavouring agents 1.4 wt%.REPLACEMENTSHEET 

In WO 91/01091 a starch hydrolysate is disclosed having a molecular weight less than 10,000 which may be used as a fat replacement ingredient in food products including sauces and dressings. EP 229 938 discloses a dry, particulate creamer- thickener product comprising 5-45 wt% fat, 0-0.5 wt% of an emulsifying agent, 25-75 wt% hydrolysed starch, 20-60 wt% starch and 0.8 wt% water. This product may be used for preparing soups and sauces.Several recipes for household preparation of sauces and soups with fat contents in the range of 1-10 wt% are available.Typically, such recipes comprise cooked vegetable ingredients which, when blended in the sauce or soup, contribute to a creamy consistency. Furthermore, such household recipes typically comprise flour, dairy cream or sour cream.Whereas the above cited prior art recipes comprise starch, starch derivatives or blended vegetable
