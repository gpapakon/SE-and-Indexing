<ABSTRACT>
A device for rigidly mounting a thin-walled hollow cylinder (10) comprises a hollow support cylinder (7) which is rotatable about its cylinder axis and over which the hollow cylinder (10) can be fitted. A pressurised fluid flows from the inside to the outside through the cylinder wall of the support cylinder (7). For this purpose there are a plurality of passage openings (19) in the cylinder wall of the support cylinder (7), which passage openings are arranged distributed both in the longitudinal and in the circumferential direction of the support cylinder (7). The outside diameter of the support cylinder (7) is selected such that the hollow cylinder (10) comes to rest thereon with only little clearance of some hundredths to tenths of a millimetre. If air is blown into the support cylinder (7), a flowing air cushion with very good centring and vibration-damping characteristics is produced in the thin annular space formed by the support cylinder (7) and hollow cylinder (10).

Device for the dimensionally stable mounting of 
a thin-walled hollow cylinder (10), having a hollow 

carrier cylinder (7) which can be rotated about its 
cylinder axis and over which the hollow cylinder (10) can 

be pushed, characterized in that 

there are present in the cylinder wall of the carrier 
cylinder (7) a multiplicity of passage openings (19) 

which are arranged distributed both in the longitudinal 
direction and in the circumferential direction of the 

carrier cylinder (7), 
the external diameter of the carrier cylinder (7) is 
selected such that the hollow cylinder (10) comes to rest 

directly upon it with only little play, and 
the passage openings (19) of the carrier cylinder (7) 
are flowed through from the inside to the outside by a 

fluid which is under a superatmospheric pressure. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the passage openings (19) are arranged distributed 

uniformly both in the longitudinal direction and in the 
circumferential direction of the carrier cylinder (7). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the distribution of the passage openings (19) 

changes in the longitudinal direction of the carrier 
cylinder (7) in accordance with a predetermined function. 
Device according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the passage openings (19) are 

arranged essentially in the whole region of the carrier 
cylinder (7) which is covered by the hollow cylinder 

(10).  
 
Device according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the passage openings (19) penetrate 

the cylinder wall of the carrier cylinder (7) radially or 
running obliquely. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the carrier cylinder (7) is sealed 

at both its ends by centring cylinders (8, 9) which 
receive it and are rotatably mounted, and at least one of 

which has a passage duct (12, 13) running coaxially. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that one of the centring cylinders (8) is coupled to a 

rotary drive. 
Device according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized 
in that the centring cylinder (8) which is coupled to the 

rotary drive has a conical widening (11) onto which one 
end of the hollow cylinder (10) can be pushed. 
Device according to Claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that the concomitantly running centring cylinder (9) 

is held by a tailstock centre (6) and both apparatuses 
(9, 6) have central passage ducts (13, 14) running in the 

longitudinal direction and connected to each other. 
Device according to Claim 8 or 9, characterized 
in that the tailstock centre (6) and tailstock (5) can be 

removed or lowered. 
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that a blower apparatus or air 

compression apparatus (17, 18) is connected to the 
passage ducts (12, 13, 14). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized by an apparatus (21) for fixing the hollow 

cylinder (10) in relation to the carrier cylinder (7). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized by an apparatus (21) for sealing a gap 

between hollow cylinder (10) and carrier cylinder (7) at 
one end of the hollow cylinder (10). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 13, 
cha
racterized in that an annular gap which is present 
between carrier cylinder (7) and hollow cylinder (10) has 

a radial thickness which is preferably in the range from  
 

0.02 to 0.3 mm. 
Use of the device according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 14 for the dimensionally stable clamping of 

screen printing cylinders for photomechanical patterning.
