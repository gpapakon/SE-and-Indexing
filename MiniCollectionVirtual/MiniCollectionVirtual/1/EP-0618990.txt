<ABSTRACT>
A device for covering an aperture in a wall surfaced with tiles or plates has a holder (7) for a permanent magnet (8) co-operating with a ferromagnetic component fitted on the inside of a tile or plate-surfaced cover concealing the aperture. The holder (7) is fitted beyond a predetermined breaking point (12) with an attachment with a threaded bolt (6) which can be screwed into the threaded hole (5) of a frame surrounding the aperture to be covered. After the attachment has been separated along the breaking point (12), the holder (7) may be secured to an anchor securable in the wall which has a flat section insertable into a slot (15) in the holder (7).

<CLAIMS>
A device for covering a wall aperture or the like, for example a breach or a recess, in 

masonry (21) which is covered on its surface with tiles or slabs (10), with a cover which 
is provided on its outside with at least one tile or slab (10) and which on its inside consists 

at least in part of a ferromagnetic material (9), and with retaining members (7) 
fixable to the edge of the aperture for permanent magnets (8) cooperating with the ferromagnetic 

material (9), 
characterized in that
 each retaining member (7) is connected by 
way of a nominal breaking point (12) to an attachment releasably connectable to a frame 

(1, 2) which surrounds the aperture and is anchored in the masonry and the size of which 
can be set in accordance with the different formats of the tiles or slabs, and after the separation 

of the attachment along the nominal breaking point each retaining member (7) is 
releasably connectable to a separate anchoring member (13) which can be secured individually 

to the masonry (21). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the attachment is provided with a 
threaded bolt (6) which can be screwed into a threaded bore (5) provided in the frame (1. 

2). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the retaining member (7) is provided 
with a slot (15) into which a portion (14) of the anchoring member (13) can be inserted. 
A device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a connexion with positive locking 
is provided between a plate-shaped portion (14) of the anchoring member (13) and the 

slot (15) in the retaining member (7) by way of knobs (16) engaging in depressions (17). 
A device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the anchoring member (13) has a 
stepped shape and comprises the plate-shaped portion (14), a fastening portion (19) - 

situated in a plane parallel to the plate-shaped portion (14) - for fastening to the masonry, 
and a connexion portion (18) connecting the plate-shaped portion (14) and the fastening 

portion (19). 
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the connexion portion 
(18) is provided with at least one tongue (23) which projects beyond the fastening portion 

(19) secured to the masonry (21) and which, when fitted in the masonry, extends at a  
 

right angle to the surface of the masonry. 
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the fastening portion 
(19) of the anchoring member (13) which can be secured to the masonry is provided with 

holes (22).
