<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to low voltage power cables and, 
more particularly, to the insulating layer(s) of the cable. A typical low voltage power cable is constructed of metal 
conductors insulated with a polymeric material. These elements are 
generally twisted to form a core and are protected by another 
polymeric sheath or jacket material. In certain cases, added 
protection is afforded by inserting a wrap between the core and the 
sheath. In order to have the low voltage power cable approved by 
the Underwriters Laboratories, the insulation must pass a stringent 
test with regard to its long term "wet" electrical properties at an 
elevated temperature under a specified electrical stress, e.g., a 
temperature of 75° C at a stress of 600 volts per 15 or 45 mil layer. 
The term or period of time for immersion in water is a minimum of 
12 weeks. The test is described in Underwriters Laboratories 83 
(UL-83), Tenth Edition, revision dated September 25, 1991, 
paragraphs 30.1 to 30.4. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that 
insulation meeting this severe test is decidedly more capable of 
successfully dealing with wet applications than those highly filled 
cables which have a tendency, when exposed to water, to increase 
charge species movement, i.e., conductivity, within the polymer 
structure thus lowering insulation resistance (IR). It is expected, 
however, that the cable will not only meet the UL-83 test, but the 
UL-44 requirements as well provided that the cable is crosslinked. 
Good flame retardance, low smoke, low corrosivity, and low toxicity  
 
add to the industrial requirements for low voltage power cable, 
which will be exposed to aggravated water conditions. An object of this invention, then, is to provide a 
composition useful as insulation in low voltage power cable 
construction, which will meet UL-83, UL-44, and other industrial 
requirements for insulation having the capability of surviving an 
extremely wet environment. Other objects and advantages will 
become apparent hereinafter. According to the invention, a composition has been 
discovered which meets the above objective. This composition 
comprises: 
(i) a linear polyethylene having a density equal to or less 
than 0.915 gram per cubic centimeter; (ii) a linear polyethylene having a density in the range of 
0.916 to 0.925 gram per cubic centimeter, grafted with an 
unsaturated aliphatic diacid anhydride, said grafted polyethylene 
being present in an amount of about 40 to about 400 parts by weight 
based on 100
