<ABSTRACT>
A plural cavity structure (10), suitable for use 
as a microwave filter (34, 34A, 34B), has plural 

cavities (24, 26, 28, 30) disposed within a 
cylindrical aluminum housing (12) and having a 

central planar transverse wall (18) including an 
iris (38) for coupling of electromagnetic power 

between two successive ones of the cavities (28, 
26), the transverse planar wall being centrally 

located in the case of the four-cavity structure. 
Additional transverse walls (14, 16, 20, 22) are 

constructed as discs and serve as end walls of the 
cavities and, in the case of the inboard discs, 

the discs are provided with apertures (36, 40) to 
serve as coupling irises for coupling 

electromagnetic power between the cavities which 
serve as resonant chambers of the microwave 

filter. The transverse walls are bowed, and 
peripheral regions of the walls are clamped by 

metallic rings (66, 68, 70, 72) differing in their 
coefficients of thermal expansion. Thus, the 

rings (68, 70) of the inboard transverse walls 
(16, 20) are formed of titanium having a 

relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, 
while the rings (66, 72) of the outboard 

transverse walls (14, 22) are formed of invar 
having a relatively low coefficient of thermal 

expansion. As a result of the differing 
coefficients of thermal expansion, the outer 

transverse walls experience greater deformation  
 

than do the inner transverse walls with changes in 
environmental temperature resulting in a net 

decrease in axial length of both inboard and 
outboard cavities upon an increase in 

environmental temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal
stabilization of a multiple cavity structure,
wherein cylindrical cavities are arranged coaxially
in tandem, as in the construction of a microwave
filter of plural resonant chambers, or cavities,
and, more particularly, to an arrangement of
multiple cavities employing transverse bowed walls
with and without coupling apertures encircled by
rings of material with differing coefficients of
thermal expansion to provide selected ratios of
thermally induced deformation of the transverse
walls to counteract changes in resonance induced by
thermal expansion/contraction of an outer
cylindrical wall of the cavity structure.Plural cavity structures are employed for
microwave filters. A cavity which is frequently
employed has the shape of a right circular cylinder
wherein the diameter and the height (or the axial
length) of the cavity together determine the value
of a resonant frequency. For filters described
mathematically as multiple pole filters, it is
common practice to provide a cylindrical housing
with transverse disc shaped partitions or walls
defining the individual cavities. Irises in the
partitions provide for coupling of desired modes of
electromagnetic wave between the cavities to
provide a desired filter function or response. A problem arises in that changes in
environmental temperature induce changes in the
dimensions of the filter with a consequent shift in
the resonant frequency of each filter section. For
example, a filter fabricated of aluminum undergoes
substantial dimensional changes as compared to a
filter constructed of invar due to the much larger
thermal coefficient of expansion for aluminum as
compared to invar.A solution to the foregoing problem, useful
for a two-cavity filter is presented in United
States patent 4,677,403 of Kich. Therein, an end
wall of each cavity is formed of a bowed disc,
while a central wall having an iris for coupling
electromagnetic energy has a planar form. An
increase of temperature enlarges the diameter of
each cavity, and also increases the bowing of the
end walls with a consequent reduction in the axial
length of each cavity. The resonant frequency
shift associated with the increased diameter is
counterbalanced by the shift associated with the
decrease in length. Similar compensation occurs
during a reduction in temperature wherein the
diameter decreases and the length increases. The aforementioned problem is overcome and
other advantages are provided by a cylindrical
filter structure of multiple cavities wherein, in
accordance
