<ABSTRACT>
A mobile communication system requires no fill 
code in a signal transmitted by way of radio 

communication between a mobile station and a radio base 
station. In a radio base station or a mobile station, a 

base station fill controller or a mobile station fill 
controller deletes a fill code from a picture signal 

which has been delivered from a facsimile apparatus 
connected thereto and which is to be transmitted to 

another facsimile apparatus through a radio circuit, and 
a base station fill controller or a mobile station fill 

controller inserts a fill code into a picture signal 
transmitted from another facsimile apparatus through the 

radio circuit such that the scan time of the picture 
signal is not shorter than the minimum scan line time of 

the facsimile apparatus connected thereto which is read 
from a base station terminal ability memory or a mobile 

station terminal ability memory. The picture signal 
with the inserted fill code is then delivered to the 

facsimile apparatus connected thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile
communication method and a mobile communication system
for transmitting and receiving a facsimile picture
signal between a radio base station and a mobile station
through a radio circuit.Facsimile communications are finding more and
more use in mobile communication systems. See for example the article of the Vehicular Technology Society, 42nd VTS Conference, 18th May 1992, pages 240-246, Dimolitsas et al.: "Group 3 Facsimile Transmission over Digital Satellite Land Mobile Networks". For
transmitting a picture signal from a transmitting
facsimile apparatus in a mobile station or a radio base
station to a receiving facsimile apparatus over a radio
circuit, it has been customary for the transmitting
facsimile apparatus to send to the radio circuit a
picture signal with one fill code inserted per scanning
line to match the minimum scan line time (hereinafter
referred to as "MSLT") of the receiving facsimile apparatus. As example of the use of a fill code is given in US-A-4 301 479.While picture signal of the prior art is
transmitted from the transmitting facsimile equipment
over the radio circuit with one fill code inserted per
scanning line, the fill code is only for formatting the
picture and otherwise has no message content. As a
result, the transmission efficiency of the radio circuit 
has heretofore been low because the amount of transmitted
information is increased by the inserted fill code.Various efforts have been made to avoid the
above shortcomings. For example, JP-A-59-166 241
discloses an arrangement
for deleting a fill code from data transmitted from a
facsimile apparatus to a computer. Deletion of a fill
code at the time image data are stored by a computer is
disclosed in JP-A-1-184 147.
However, no attempts have heretofore been
made to delete a fill code for radio communications.It is therefore an object of the present
invention to provide a mobile communication system which
requires no fill code in a signal transmitted by way of
radio communication between a mobile station and a radio
base station, and a mobile communication method to be
used in such a mobile communication system. This object in solved with the features of the claims. In the radio base station or the mobile
station, therefore, the base station fill code deleting
means or the mobile station fill code deleting means
deletes a fill code from the picture signal which has
been delivered from the facsimile apparatus connected
thereto and which is to be transmitted to another
facsimile
