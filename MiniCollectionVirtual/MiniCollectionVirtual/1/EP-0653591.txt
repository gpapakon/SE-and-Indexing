<ABSTRACT>
A burner for liquid fuel which is capable of providing a long flame having a large proportion of a luminous 
flame portion effective for radiation heat transfer. This burner consists of a fuel supply tube (4) having a fuel ejection 

nozzle (3) at a front end portion thereof, a combustion support gas supply tube (6) provided on the outer side of and 
coaxially with the fuel supply tube (4) so as to form a combustion support gas passage (5), and an orifice member (7) 

provided in the portion of the interior of the fuel supply tube (4) which is spaced from the front end portion thereof. 
Orifices (9) in the orifice member (7) and the fuel ejection nozzle (3) in the fuel supply tube (4) are eccentric with 

respect to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid fuel burner, and
more particularly, to a liquid fuel burner suitable for
various types of furnaces using radiant heat transfer from a
flame, such as a glass melting furnace, according to the preamble
of claim 1, as well as a particular us of such a burner.A burner for liquid fuel is disclosed by the US patent
no. 4,216,908.In glass melting furnaces, a burner has conventionally been
used in which a liquid fuel such as fuel oil or kerosene is
burned in air for uniform temperature rise and heating of
the glass. In these furnaces, a melting method is employed
whereby the flame is not brought in direct contact with the
glass, but rather is heated primarily by transfer of radiant
heat.However, when air is used as the combustion assisting gas,
the volume of exhaust gas increases since nitrogen is
contained in the air that does not contribute to combustion.
Accompanying this, the heat loss due to the exhaust gas
carried away from the furnace also increases, thus resulting
in poor thermal efficiency. In addition, produced NOX
emission level is also very high.The use of oxygen for the combustion assisting gas is then
considered. When oxygen is used for the combustion
assisting gas, since the amount of combustion exhaust gas is
reduced to roughly 1/5 in comparison with that in the case
of using air, the amount of heat carried away by the
combustion exhaust gas is also reduced to roughly 1/4-1/5.
Together with this resulting in higher thermal efficiency,
the amount of NOX produced is also considerably reduced. However, the flame produced by a conventional liquid fuel
burner that uses oxygen gas for the combustion assisting gas
is extremely disadvantageous for using melting means
consisting primarily of radiant heat transfer from the
flame. The following provides a detailed description of
this.As disclosed in, for example, the specification of U.S.
Patent No. 4,216,908, liquid fuel gas burners of the prior
art that use oxygen gas for the combustion assisting gas are
composed of a fuel feed pipe having a fuel spray nozzle at
its distal end, a combustion assisting gas feed pipe
provided concentrically on the outside of said fuel supply
pipe to form a combustion assisting gas passage, a swirler
arranged within the above-mentioned fuel supply pipe in
close proximity to the above-mentioned fuel spray nozzle,
and a plurality of combustion assisting gas spray nozzles
provided continuous with the above-mentioned combustion
assisting gas passage around the above-mentioned fuel spray
