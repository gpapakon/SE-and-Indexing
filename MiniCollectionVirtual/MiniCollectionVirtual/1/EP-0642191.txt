<ABSTRACT>
A digitally controlled beam former for a spacecraft which includes means for 
periodically calibrating the feed paths of the spacecraft's antenna array by measuring 

the apparent movement of the centre of a reference signal and a nominal signal and 
utilising the measured data to compensate for at least the phase drift in the antenna 

feed paths. The measured data may also be used to compensate for amplitude and 
phase drift in the antenna feed paths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a digitally controlled beam former for a spacecraft. There is a requirement in spacecraft for active arrays for both beam forming 
and null operation. The key component of these active array subsystems is a digitally 
controlled beam former in which variation of amplitude and phase of the individual 
antenna elements of the spacecraft's antenna array is effected under digital control. Experience gained from existing spacecraft highlights the difficulties of 
maintaining phase and amplitude calibration over the life and temperature of x-band 
digitally controlled beam formers. The requirements of null generation gives rise to 
a tight specification for these parameters and thereby temperature control within the 
limits ± 2°C. With a relatively large number of antenna array elements and spot beams, 
thermal control of the beam formers will be difficult to attain and will probably not, 
therefore, be an acceptable method of controlling phase and amplitude calibration of 
the beam forming elements. It is an object of the present invention to provide a digitally controlled beam 
former for a spacecraft in which each of the N-paths of the beam former for each 
element of the spacecraft's receive and transmit antenna arrays is periodically 
calibrated against a secure tracking telemetry and command (TT&C) uplink. This 
calibration process not only addresses the major design problem of amplitude and drift 
in the antenna element feed paths but can also provide the spacecraft with a secure 
pointing reference which can be utilised to provide back up attitude and orbit control 
system (AOCS) data in the event that the main optical sensors are disabled for any  
 
reason. The invention provides a digitally controlled beam former for a spacecraft 
having a multi-element antenna array and a control processor for the antenna array, 
the beam former having N-paths for each element of the antenna array, each of the 
N-paths being connected to a separate one of N-beam forming channels and to a 
separate one of the outputs of the antenna array control processor for controlling the 
weighting applied to the amplitude and phase signals of the respect path, 
characterised in that the beam former includes means for periodically calibrating each 
of the N-paths of each element (A, B, C) of the spacecraft's antenna array (2) by 
measuring the apparent movement of the centre of a reference signal and a nominal 
signal and utilising the measured data to compensate for phase drift in the antenna 
feed
