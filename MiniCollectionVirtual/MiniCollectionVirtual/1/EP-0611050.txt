<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
polyols and polyisocyanates, which can be used in the 
synthesis of polyurethanes. The present invention relates also to the 
polyurethanes obtained by using said compounds. It is well known to manufacture polyurethane materials of a cellular or non-cellular, 
flexible or rigid nature by reacting organic polyisocyanates having 
two or more isocyanate groups per molecule with compounds containing a 
plurality of isocyanate reactive groups, for example polyols and polyamines, 
in the presence, where required, of other components such as blowing agents, 
cross-linking agents, catalysts and surfactants. 
These polyurethane materials may take the form of adhesives, coatings, 
elastomers, fibres, films, foams, thermoplastics and the like. Polyols for use in preparing polyurethanes are usually prepared by reacting 
an initiator compounds having a plurality of active hydrogen atoms (alcohols 
or amines) with an alkylene oxide (usually propylene oxide). A suitable 
initiator compound is diaminodiphenylmethane (methylenedianiline). 
Polyamines for use in preparing polyurethanes are obtained by converting the 
hydroxyl end-groups of the polyols to amino end-groups. Organic polyisocyanates for use in preparing polyurethanes are conventionally 
manufactured by reacting phosgene with the corresponding organic polyamines. 
Thus the starting materials for diisocyanatodiphenylmethane (MDI) and its 
homologues, are the mixtures of isomers and homologues of 
diaminodiphenylmethane that are formed by the condensation reaction of 
formaldehyde and aniline. We have now found novel 
polyols and polyisocyanates derived from certain diamino compounds. These novel compounds are derived from diamino compounds 
corresponding to general formula (I)
