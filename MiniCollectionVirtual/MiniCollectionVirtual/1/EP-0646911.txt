<ABSTRACT>
In an optical head apparatus, a minute light 
beam spot is formed on a recording medium (6) by a focusing 

lens (5). The focusing lens focuses light radiated from a 
light source (1) to provide the minute light beam spot. 

Between the light source and the focusing lens, a light 
intensity or phase distribution converter (121) is provided, 

so that the minute light beam spot will be a super 
resolved light beam spot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical head 
apparatus, and more particularly to an optical head 
apparatus which is applied to an information input and 
output apparatus for recording information into a 
recording medium and reading information from the 
recording medium by use of light. In an information input and output apparatus for 
recording information into a recording medium and 
reading information from the recording medium by use of 
light, there is a disk-like recording medium on which 
concentric or spiral tracks are provided to form 
recording pits thereon, thereby recording binary 
information into the recording medium in accordance 
with the presence or non-presence of the recorded pit. 
The recorded pit is formed on the track by projecting a 
minute light beam spot obtained in accordance with the 
focusing of light radiated from a light source. 
Information thus recorded in the recording medium is 
read from the recording medium by supplying a minute 
light beam spot to the track and receiving light 
reflected from the track, thereby detecting the 
presence or non-presence of the recording pit. For the 
purpose of recording information into a recording  
 
medium and reading information from the recording 
medium, a typical type of an optical head apparatus 
comprises a light source for radiating light of a 
predetermined wavelength, a focusing lens for focusing 
the light on the recording medium, an optical system 
for separating light reflected on the recording medium 
from a path of the light directly radiated from the 
light source, and an optical detector for detecting the 
light returned from the recording medium. Such an 
optical head apparatus is described on pages 483 to 489 
of "Applied Optics, Vol. 25, No. 4, 15 February 1986". In the optical head apparatus, the smaller the 
diameter of a minute light beam spot focused on the 
recording medium is the better for the purpose of 
increasing recorded dencity. The diameter of the 
minute light beam spot depends on the wavelength "λ" of 
light radiated from the light source, and a numerical 
aperture "NA" of the focusing lens, such that it is 
proportional to "λ/NA". Therefore, the development of 
an optical head apparatus has been promoted in a 
direction that the wavelength λ is short, and the 
numerical aperture NA is large, so that the diameter of 
the minute light beam spot becomes small. Another optical head apparatus is described on 
pages 553 to 557 of "Journal of the Optical Society of 
America, Vol. 39, No. 7, July 1949" in
