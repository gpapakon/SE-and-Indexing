<ABSTRACT>
The washing device for the front glass of a lamp or of a headlamp (1) of a vehicle has a first tubular connector (10) which bears the nozzle (3) and a second tubular connector (9) which is joined in a tight manner to the first tubular connector (10). The two tubular connectors have an automatic locking device which prevents them being pulled apart. The locking device consists of a toothed rack-like catch (21) which is attached to a tubular connector (10) and a locking latch (24) which is attached to the other tubular connector (9). The two tubular connectors are connected to one another fixed in terms of rotation by means of an axial guide (20).

Washer system for a lens plate of a vehicle lamp or 
headlamp, having a first pipe socket (10) which 

carries a nozzle (3) and which is adapted to be 
passed, with its end furthest from the nozzle (3) 

first, through an opening (11) in an outer vehicle 
body part (12), and having a second pipe socket (9) 

which is set in a housing of a hydraulic adjustment 
mechanism (2) so as to be adjustable axially and 

secured against torsion and which is pushed tightly 
onto or into the first pipe socket (10), the 

adjustment mechanism (2) being adapted to be fastened 
by an attachment means to an inner vehicle body part 

(7) and the nozzle (3) being adapted to be moved by 
the adjustment mechanism (2) into a rest position in 

which it, or a component (16) surrounding it, adjoins 
the outside of the outer vehicle body part (12), or 

alternatively into an operational position, 
characterized in that when the nozzle (3) is in the 

rest position the telescoped pipe sockets (9 and 10) 
have an immobilizing device which automatically 

prevents them from being drawn apart and which 
consists of a rack-type ratchet stop (23) mounted on 

the pushed-in pipe socket (10) and a resilient 
retaining catch (24) which is mounted on the pushed-on 

outer pipe socket (9) and engages into the ratchet 
stop (23), and that between the two pipe sockets (9 

and 10) there is an axial guide (20, 21) which 
immobilises the first pipe socket (10) against 

twisting on its longitudinal axis. 
Washer system according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the axial guide (20, 21) between the two pipe 

sockets (9 and 10) is formed by a tongue-and-groove 
joint.  

 
Washer system according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the rack-type ratchet stop (23) is formed by a 

shoulder (21) which in its longitudinal extension 
runs in the direction in which the pipe sockets (9 

and 10) are joined, is moulded onto the generated 
surface of the pushed-in pipe socket (10) and acts as 

a spring for the tongue-and-groove joint, the teeth 
of the rack-type ratchet stop (23) being incorporated 

into the radially aligned surface of the shoulder 
(21) and the groove (20) being incorporated into the 

inside of the pushed-on pipe socket (9) and being 
open as far as the free end of the pipe socket (9). 
Washer system according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the retaining catch (24) is 

formed by an arm of radially resilient construction 
which is moulded on the pushed-on pipe socket (9) and 

which is moulded onto the rim of an opening (25) 
incorporated into the base of the groove (20). 
Washer system according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the resilient arm (24) points 

with its free end portion (26) towards the ratchet 
stop (23), engages between two teeth of the ratchet 

stop (23) and is shaped like a wedge in the cross-section 
extending in the direction of the 

longitudinal extension, one cuneiform face (27) 
extending approximately radially and at a right angle 

to the direction in which the pipe sockets are joined 
and bearing against a radial face of one of the teeth 

of the ratchet stop (23), these radially extending 
surfaces being mounted on such a face respectively of 

the teeth of the ratchet stop (23) and of the wedge 
(26) of the arm (24) that the radial surfaces rest 

prestressed against one another when the pipe sockets 
(9 and 10) are drawn apart.  

 
Washer system according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the resilient arm (24) and the radially 

extending surface (27) of its end portion of 
cuneiform cross-section point away from the free end 

of the pipe socket on which the arm is mounted. 
Washer system according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the resilient arm (24) 

incorporates a recess (29) which serves to engage a 
bar-shaped tool by means of which the resilient arm 

(24) can be moved out of engagement with the ratchet 
stop (23). 
Washer system according to any of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that between its free end and the 

ratchet stop (23), the pushed-in pipe socket (10) has 
at least one annular groove incorporated into its 

generated surface, and into said groove is inserted 
a ring seal (18) which bears tightly all round 

against the inside of the pushed-on pipe socket (9), 
and that the groove (20) of the tongue-and-groove 

joint is set deeply enough into the pushed-on pipe 
socket (9) and the shoulder (21) of the pushed-in 

pipe socket (10) is set high enough for the ring seal 
(18) to be unable to strike the free end portion (26) 

of the resilient arm (24) when the pipe sockets (9 
and 10) are inserted one inside the other. 
Washer system according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the pushed-on pipe socket (9) 

exhibits greater clearance in the end portion (19) in 
which the ratchet stop (23) is disposed than in the 

portion which is sealed by a ring seal (18) towards 
the pushed-in pipe socket (10). 
Washer system according to claim 9, characterized in 
that thanks to at least one projection (22) moulded  

 
onto its generated surface, the pushed-in pipe socket 

(10) rests virtually without any radial freeplay 
against the end portion (19) of the other pipe socket 

(9), which exhibits greater clearance.
