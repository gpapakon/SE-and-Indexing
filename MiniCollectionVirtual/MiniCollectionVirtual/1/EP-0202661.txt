<ABSTRACT>
The present application discloses a new process for isoÂ­
lating castanospermine from Castanospermum australe and 

the use of castanospermine or a salt thereof as a medicament. 
Castanospermine has been found useful for inhibiting 
carbohydrate adsorption particularly in diabetic patients.

<DESCRIPTION>
Castanospermine is an alkaloid having the following 
formula: 
Systematically, this compound is named (1S,6S,7R,8R,8aR)-1,6,7,8-tetrahydroxyindolizidine. The isolation of this compound from Castanospermum 
australe has been described by L.D. Hohenshutz, et al., 
Phytochemistry, 20, 811 (1981). The procedure involves a 
tedious extraction and a subsequent washing with pyridine 
and only small quantities of the desired product are obtained. 
R.C. Bernotas, et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 25, 
165 (1984) obtained castanospermine by total synthesis and  
 
thereby established the absolute configuration of the compound. Several publications have appeared which describe castanospermine 
as an inhibitor of a number of plant enzymes. 
See Y.T. Pan, et al., Biochemistry, 22, 3975 (1983); 
R. Saul, et al., Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 
221, 593 (1983); R. Saul, et al., Archives of Biochemistry 
and Biophysics, 230, 668 (1984). More recently, Saul et 
al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 82, 93 (1985) have indicated 
that castanospermine inhibits intestinal glycosidases 
(i.e., maltase and sucrase) in rats when administered by 
injection and that diarrhea and high levels of intestinal 
bacterial flora were observed when high doses were administered. 
However, they gave no indication that castanospermine 
would be useful for any purposes as a result of 
these facts. Acarbose, or Bay-g-5421, is described in Metabolism, Vol. 31, 1982, 
pages 710-714 as an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that reduced carbohydrate 
induced hypertriglyceridemia when is administered with the diet. In Metabolism, Vol. 31, 1982, pages 88-92, it is reported that this 
compound was found capable of modifying the metabolic response of diabetic 
rats to high carbohydrate diet when it was included into such a diet. It has now been found that castanospermine possesses 
digestive enzyme inhibitory properties and thus can be used 
as an antidiabetic agent and as an inhibitor of increased 
lipid biosynthesis. Thus, when carbohydrate is ingested 
either as glucose or in a form such as maltose, sucrose or 
starch in food or drink, the blood glucose level rises to 
elevated concentrations. In healthy subjects, this hyperglycemic 
state quickly returns to normal, the glucose in 
the blood being rapidly metabolized and stored and/or 
utilized by the organism. In diabetes mellitus, however, 
the glucose tolerance of the patient is lowered and the 
abnormally high blood sugar levels which develop remain 
elevated for prolonged periods of time. A similar
