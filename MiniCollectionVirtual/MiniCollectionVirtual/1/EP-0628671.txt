<ABSTRACT>
An insulating block for masonrywork to be erected without jointing mortar exhibits a horizontal filling duct (10), running along the upper side (1) of the block, and a vertical filling duct (11), running within the insulating block. In each case one vertical shaft clearance (12 and 13) is provided in the two end walls (4, 5, respectively) of the insulating block. Said shaft clearance, together with the respectively associated shaft clearance of an adjacent insulating block, forms a common vertical filling shaft.

Insulating block for masonry to be erected without jointing mortar, having 
a horizontal filling channel (10) running along the top of the block (1), with at 

least one vertical filling shaft (11) crossing the horizontal filling channel (10), 
running inside the insulating block, with several air slots (15-18) running at least 

partly parallel to the side walls (3) of the insulating block, a vertical shaft recess 
(12 or 13) being provided in each of the two face walls (4, 5) of the insulating 

block, which forms, with a common filling shaft (14) with a corresponding shaft 
recess (13 or 12) of each adjacent insulating block, an air slot (19), in each case 

open to the front (4 or 5) of the insulating block being located, which is aligned 
with a corresponding air slot (19) of each adjacent insulating block, and the 

insulating block being fitted with a vertical projection (6) constructed on one of 
the face walls and a vertical recess (7) constructed on the opposite face wall (4), 

which form a mortar-tight tongue-and-groove joint of adjacent insulating blocks, 
the vertical shaft recesses (12, 13) each being provided into the vertical projection 

(6) or in the vertical recess (7), and the air slots (19) each being located on both 
sides of the front vertical recess (7) and of the vertical projection (6). 
Insulating block according to Claim 1, characterized in that the air slots 
(19) open to the front (4 or 5) overlap with other air slots (16, 18) inside the 

insulating block. 
Insulating block according to claim 1, characterized in that all the air slots 
(15-19) run parallel to the side walls (3). 
Insulating block according to Claim 1, characterized in that an air slot 
(18), is located in each case adjacent and parallel to the two side walls (3) and 

outside the horizontal filling channel (10), said slot being open on the top (1) and 
the bottom (2) of the insulating block. 
Insulating block according to Claim 1, characterized in that only a single 
vertical filling shaft (11) is provided inside the insulating block. 
Insulating block according to Claim 1 or 2. characterized in that the 
vertical filling shaft (11 or 14) has a circular cross-section.
