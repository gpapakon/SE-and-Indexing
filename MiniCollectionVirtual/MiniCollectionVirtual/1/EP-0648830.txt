<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chlorine-free lubricating oils having additives which are compatible with fluoroelastomer seals. In particular, this invention is directed toward a lubricating oil having modified polyamino alkenyl or alkyl succinimides which are the reaction product of an alkenyl- or alkyl-substituted succinic anhydride and a polyalkylene polyamine, wherein the reaction product is post-treated with a cyclic carbonate. The modified polyamino alkenyl or alkyl succinimides of this invention have been found to be compatible with fluoroelastomer seals and, for concentration levels at which fluoroelastomer seal compatibility is achieved, to possess improved dispersancy and/or detergency properties when employed in a lubricating oil.It is known in the art that alkenyl- or alkyl-substituted succinic anhydrides have been used as dispersants and/or detergents in lubricating oils and fuels. Such alkenyl- or alkyl-substituted succinic anhydrides have been prepared by three well-known processes: a thermal process (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,361,673), a chlorination process (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,172,892) and a combination of the thermal and chlorination processes (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 3,912,764). The polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride ("PIBSA") produced by the thermal process has been characterized as a monomer containing a double bond in the product. Although the exact structure of chlorination PIBSA has not been definitively determined, the chlorination process PIBSA materials have been characterized as monomers containing either a double bond, a ring other than succinic anhydride ring and/or chlorine in the product. [(See J. Weill and B. Sillion, "Reaction of Chlorinated Polyisobutene with Maleic Anhydride: Mechanism Catalysis by Dichloramaleic Anhydride," Revue de l'Institut Francais du Petrole, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 77-89 (January-February, 1985).] Such compositions include one-to-one monomeric adducts (see, e.g., U.S. Patents Nos. 3,219,666; 3,381,022) as well as "multiply adducted" products, adducts having alkenyl-derived substituents adducted with at least 1.3 succinic groups per alkenyl-derived substituent (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,234,435).Alkenyl or alkyl succinimides formed by the reaction of an alkenyl- or alkyl-substituted succinic anhydride and a polyamine are also well known as lubricating oil dispersant and/or detergent additives. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,361,673 and 3,018.250.As taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,612,132 ("the '132 patent"), alkenyl or alkyl succinimides may
