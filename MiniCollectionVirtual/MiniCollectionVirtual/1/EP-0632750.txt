<ABSTRACT>
In a disk centrifuge, the separation effect is improved at the same time as the centrifugate is more gently treated. The disks (72) of a stack (70) of disks that evacuate radially inwards the centrifugate from a centrifugating chamber (50) have a curved concave shape, seen in the axial section, and are preferably linked with each other into a spiral of disks. A device for evacuating the specific heavier components of the material to be centrifugated from the centrifuge has in total four rotary parts (10, 20, 30, 40) movable with respect to each other. The radially innermost rotary part (30) allows pre-thickening to be carried out and thus improves the separation effect.
