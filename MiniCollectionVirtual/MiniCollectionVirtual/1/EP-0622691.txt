<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an automatic conveying 
device for use in an image copying machine. The a
utomatic 
conveyor (4) comprises a main portion (14) mounted to pivot 

between a closed position to cover a transparent plate (8) 
and an open position to expose the transparent plate (8). 

Document conveying means (74) convey a document along the 
transparent plate (8) when the main portion frame member 

(70) is placed in the closed position. The main portion 
frame member (70) is mounted via a hinge mechanism (72) so 

as to be pivotally coupled to the housing (6) at a position 
at the back of the center of gravity of the main portion 

(14). A resiliently urging means (264) is interposed between 
the movable frame member and a pivoting member (182) 

of the hinge mechanism (72), in order to impart a balancing 
rotational moment of a required amount to the frame member 

(70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic document conveying 
device adapted to an image processor such as an 
electrostatic copying machine or an image reader. It is widely accepted practice to provide image processing 
machines such as electrostatic copying machines and image 
readers with an automatic document conveying device in order 
to automatically handle the documents in the image 
copying operation or in the image reading operation. Prior 
literature disclosing automatic document conveying devices 
can be represented by Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 
Nos. 91747/1978 and 118551/1985, and Japanese Utility Model 
Laid-Open Publication No. 49348/1986. The image processing machine such as the electrostatic 
copying machine or the image reader has a housing, and on 
the upper surface of the housing is disposed a transparent 
plate on which will be placed a document that is to be processed. 
The automatic document conveying device is usually 
equipped with a document introduction portion, a main portion 
and a document delivery portion. The document introduction 
portion includes an introduction portion frame member 
disposed on the upstream side of the transparent plate 
and a document table that extends toward the upstream side 
from the introduction portion frame member. In the introduction 
portion frame member is formed a document introduction 
passage that extends from the document table toward 
the transparent plate. A plurality of pieces of documents 
placed on the document table are sent onto the document introduction 
passage piece by piece by the operation of document  
 
sending means, and are carried onto the transparent 
plate through the document introduction passage by the 
operation of document introduction means. The main portion 
of the automatic document conveying device includes a movable 
main portion frame member that is mounted to pivot 
between a closed position to cover the transparent plate 
and an open position to bring the transparent plate exposed 
to view, and document conveying means which conveys the 
document along the transparent plate when the movable main 
portion frame member is at the closed position. The document 
conveying means is usually constituted by a conveyer 
belt mechanism mounted on the movable main portion frame 
member. The document delivery portion includes a delivery 
portion frame member disposed on the downstream side of the 
transparent plate. In the delivery portion frame member is 
formed a document delivery passage. Further, a

<CLAIMS>
An automatic document conveying device to be applied 
to an image processor that has a transparent plate (8) 

disposed on the upper surface of a housing (6) so that 
a document to be processed is placed thereon, comprising: 


a main portion (14) including a movable main portion 
frame member (70) that is mounted to pivot between a 

closed position to cover said transparent plate (8) 
and an open position to expose said transparent plate 

(8) into view, and a document conveying means (74) 
mounted on said main portion frame member (70) to convey 

the document along said transparent plate (8) when 
said main portion frame member is located at the closed 

position; wherein 
said main portion frame member (70) is mounted on the 
upper surface of said housing (6) via a hinge mechanism 

(72) which includes a stationary member (180) 
and a pivoting member (182) pivotably coupled to said 

stationary member (180), said main portion frame member 
(70) being pivotably coupled to said pivoting member 

(182) of said hinge mechanism at a portion at the 
back of the center of gravity of said main portion 

(14); and 
a resiliently urging means (264) is interposed between 
said pivoting member (182) of said hinge mechanism 

(72) and said main portion frame member (70) in order 
to give to said main portion frame member (70) a balancing 

moment of rotation nearly equal to an angular 
moment caused by the weight of said main portion (14) 

that works to pivot said main portion frame member  
 

(70) relative to said pivoting member (182) when said 
main portion frame member (70) is located at said 

closed position. 
The automatic document conveying device according to 
claim 1, wherein the magnitude of said balancing moment 

of rotation given from said resiliently urging 
means (264) to said main portion frame member (70) is 

adjustable. 
The automatic document conveying device according to 
claim 1 or 2, wherein said hinge mechanism comprises 

two mechanisms disposed so as to maintain a distance 
in the document conveying direction, and said 

main portion frame member (70) includes two coupling 
members (220) that are pivotably coupled to said two 

hinge mechanisms (72). 
The automatic document conveying device according to 
claim 1, 2 or 3, further including a brake mechanism 

(272) which consists of a stationary brake piece (274) 
and a pivotable brake piece (276) disposed on said 

main portion frame member (70), wherein when said main 
portion frame member (70) is moved to open from said 

closed position, said balancing moment of rotation 
caused by the urging action of said resiliently urging 

means (264) becomes greater than the moment of rotation 
caused by the weight of said main portion (14), 

and said main portion frame member (70) is slightly 
pivoted in the direction of said balancing moment of 

rotation with respect to said pivoting member (182) of 
said hinge mechanism, such that said pivotable brake 

piece (276) is pressed onto said stationary brake 
piece (274) and that the braking action is exerted on 

said main portion frame member (70).  
 
The automatic document conveying device according to 
claim 4, wherein said stationary brake piece (274) is 

disposed on said stationary member (180) of said hinge 
mechanism (72). 
The automatic document conveying device according to 
claim 4, wherein said pivotable brake piece (276) has 

an arcuate outer peripheral surface (290), said stationary 
brake piece (274) has an arcuate inner peripheral 

surface (280), and when said main portion 
frame member (70) is slightly pivoted in the direction 

of said balancing moment of rotation with respect to 
said pivoting member (182) of said hinge mechanism 

(72), said arcuate outer peripheral surface (290) is 
pressed onto said arcuate inner peripheral surface 

(280). 
The automatic document conveying device according to 
claim 6, wherein said stationary brake piece (274) is 

displaced in a predetermined direction with respect to 
the first arcuate inner peripheral surface (280) and 

includes a second arcuate inner peripheral surface 
(282) continuous to said first arcuate inner peripheral 

surface (280) via a step portion (284), and 
when said main portion frame member (70) is moved to 

open by more than a predetermined angle from said 
closed position, said arcuate outer peripheral surface 

(290) of said pivotable brake piece moves from said 
first arcuat
e peripheral surface (280) of said stationary 
brake member to the second arcuate inner peripheral 

surface (282) through said step portion (284), 
whereby said main portion frame member (70) is further 

slightly pivoted in the direction of said balancing 
moment of rotation with respect to said pivoting member  

 
(182) of said hinge mechanism, such that said arcuate 

outer peripheral surface (290) is pressed onto
