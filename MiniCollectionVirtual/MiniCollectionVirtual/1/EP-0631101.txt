<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to assembly devices and heat exchangers fitted with such assembly devices; these exchangers comprise mutually parallel fluid distribution pipes, between which heat-dissipating elements (5) extend. Each distribution pipe consists of juxtaposed and assembled pipe segments (1, 19). Each pipe segment (1, 19) comprises at its axial ends a male (3) or female (4) assembly element respectively comprising a frustoconical adaptor (6) or a frustoconical cavity (10) of corresponding dimensions and means for mutual locking of the segments (1).
