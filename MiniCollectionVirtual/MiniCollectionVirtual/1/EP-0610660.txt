The invention relates to a snowboard (1) with a snowboard body (2) and a binding (5, 6), in which the heel edge (3) is the edge which is displaced to the rear in the direction of travel (F). This design makes possible, in contrast to known snowboards, an improvement of the travelling characteristics and avoids unnatural body movements.
