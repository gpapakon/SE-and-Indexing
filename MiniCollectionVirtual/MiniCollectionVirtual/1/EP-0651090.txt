<ABSTRACT>
A suede-like artificial leather which is 
composed of fiber bundles and an elastomeric polymer, has 

fibrous nap on its surface and is dyed, said fiber 
bundles being composed of fine fibers (A) having a finess 

of 0.02 - 0.2 denier and microfine fibers (B) having a 
fineness not more than 1/5 of the average fi
neness of 
said fine fibers (A) and also less than 0.02 denier, said 

fibers (A) and (B) being substantially uniformly 
dispersed in cross sections of the fiber bundles, the 

ratio between the strand numbers of fibers (A) to fibers 
(B) ranging from 1/2 to 2/3, said fiber bundles not 

substantially containing the elastomeric polymer in the 
interspaces among the individual fibers constituting each 

of the fiber bundles, and the ratio of the number of 
fibers (A) to that of fibers (B) in the nap-constituting 

fibers being at least 3/1, is provided. The artificial 
leather has good appearance and hand and excels in color-developing 

property and pilling resistance, and is useful 
for making cloths, shoes, pouches, gloves and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a suede-like
artificial leather which has good appearance and feeing,
and also excels in color-developing property and pilling
resistance, and a production process thereof.Suede-like artificial leather, having a nap
composed of fiber bundles which is formed on a surface of
a substrate composed of the same fiber bundles and an
elastomeric polymer, is known. Whereas, in the field of
suede-like artificial leather, recently a high quality
product is in demand, which satisfies all of such sensory
requirements as the appearance (suede-like appearance),
hand (soft touch) and color-developing property as well
as physical requirement, e.g., pilling resistance.More specifically, it is generally practiced to
reduce the size of artificial leather-constituting fibers
to microfine denier level, for the purpose of obtaining
suede-like artificial leather of excellent appearance,
but a leather containing such microfine denier fibers
cannot be dyed to clear colors, but to only dull, whitish
colors, being inferior in color developing property. It
has also been practiced to substantially eliminate the
elastomeric polymer from the interspaces among the
individual fibers constituting each of the fiber bundles
which constitute an artificial leather in order to render
the hand of the leather extremely soft, pleasant one.
When no elastomeric polymer is present in said inter-spaces
(hereafter simply referred to as inside of the
fiber bundles), however, the raised fibers are readily
pulled out to aggravate the property which is normally
referred to as pilling resistance.Concerning improvement of color-developing
property of suede-like artificial leather with a fibrous
nap, various proposals have been made in the past. For
example, Japanese Patent Publication JP-B-55-000506 proposed to 
apply an easy dyeable resin onto surfaces of a sheet with
fibrous nap and to dye the sheet, and Japanese Patent
Publications JP-B-61-025834 or JP-B-61-046592 proposed a method of
dyeing artificial leather with a dyestuff which becomes
water-soluble as reduced in the presence of an alkali,
and then oxidizing the dye to fix it on the leather.For improving pilling resistance of suede-like
artificial leather with fibrous nap, Japanese Kokai
(laid-open) Publication JP-A-57-154468 has proposed a method
of dissolving a part of the polymer used in the leather
with a solvent for the polymer, to fix the roots of the
fibers forming the nap on the surface.As microfine denier fiber bundles in which
microfine fibers of differing deniers
