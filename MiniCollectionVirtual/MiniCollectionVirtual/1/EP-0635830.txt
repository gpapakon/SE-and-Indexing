<ABSTRACT>
An digital data recording apparatus for recording 
digital data in a form of tracks on a tape is disclosed. Each 

track has a first signal area for storing track format 
information and a second signal area for storing a plurality 

of sync blocks. The apparatus includes a circuit (111, 114) 
for inserting in the first signal area a regular TDS information 

indicating the track data structure of digital data, and 

a circuit (113, 114) for inserting in the final sync block a 
backup TDS information having the same structure as the 

regular TDS information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to method and apparatus for recording and reproducing digital data.A digital data recording/reproducing technique has been widely spread in various fields, and remarkable and rapid progress has been made in a digital AV field. Digital video tape recorders of D1 and D2 formats (SMPTE standard) using rotary heads have been put in practical use for business purposes, and rotary digital,audio tape recorders (RDAT) have also reached the stage of practical use. Moreover, an application of the technique to data streamers or the like is under consideration. ("7th Draft PROPOSED AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD HELICAL-SCAN DIGITAL COMPUTER TAPE CARTRIDGE 3.81mm(0.150in) DATA/DAT RECORDED FORMAT FOR INFORMATION INTERCHANGE" 1st November 1990, "7th Draft PROPOSED AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD HELICAL-SCAN DIGITAL COMPUTER TAPE CARTRIDGE 3.81mm (0.150in) DIGITAL DATA STORAGE (DDS) RECORD FORMAT FOR INFORMATION INTERCHANGE" 9th April 1990).A TDS information indicating the structure of data recorded in tracks for the data streamer referred to above is the same as that for audio recording, but the content of the data thereinside is different. Due to the fixed structure of data in the recording track in the data streamer, however, it is impossible to make recording in the structure of tracks fit for a to-be-recorded data.According to another conventional arrangement information showing the structure of the digital data is recorded in a particular area in each track. In this arrangement, only the signal area including the information showing the structure of the digital data is set in the same format, while the structure of the other data is made in conformity with the information showing the structure of the digital data of the recording track. This recording method enables recording of data in the structure of tracks fit for the to-be-recorded data.The signal area including the information showing the structure of the digital data in the recording track is defined as an ITI area. The structure of the data in the track and the content of the data can be recognized by detecting the ITI area at the reproducing time, and therefore, data of a different system is prevented from being erroneously reproduced and a plurality of recording patterns of different formats can be normally reproduced. In the above prior art, the ITI area cannot be correctly detected if it includes a damage, such as a scratch, in the running direction of the tape, whereby the TDS information indicating the structure of the
