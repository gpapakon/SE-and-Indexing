<ABSTRACT>
A connector device comprises a wire (40, 50) having respective end regions (41, 42, 51, 52) and a central region (43, 53) therebetween, the end regions (41, 42, 51, 52) being bent so as substantially to encircle respective spaced apart locations intermediate the ends of a spring element or elements (60, 70) to be connected, and the central region (43, 53) extending as a loop between said end regions (41, 42, 51, 52).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTION A CONNECTOR DEVICE This invention concerns a device for connecting an elongate spring element, intermediate it ends, to means for suspension of the element. The invention also concerns a device for connecting together a plurality of side by side or stacked elongate spring elements, intermediate their respective ends, whilst also providing means for suspending said elements. European Patent Aplication No. 91106803.9(Publication No. 455165) discloses a baby bouncer which essentially comprises a transversely arranged cantilever spring, in the form of an elongate steel strip of bowed configuration, and a harness (for a baby) which is suspended from the ends of the cantilever spring by cords or ropes.A suspension chain is connected to the cantilever spring at approximately its mid point by way of a connector and in use the free end of the suspension chain is clamped over a door lintel or connected to a ceiling mounted hook so that the whole assembly is suspended therefrom. 

 When a baby is installed in the haness its weight acting via the ropes causes flexure of the cantilever spring. When the baby alternately bends and straightens its knees, bouncing of the baby ensues aided by the cantilever spring, the ends of which flex upwards and downwards about the centre thereof.It has been found that drilling holes in the cantilever spring to facilitate connection of the suspension chain thereto weakens the cantilever spring and greatly increases the likelihood of mechanical failure in use. Moreover, by using rigid or fixed connections at the centre of the cantilever spring suc as nuts and bolts, welding or riveting, the cantilever spring is prevented from flexing freely about its centre and a dead area is created about the centre of the cantilever spring where virtually no flexure occurs.It is an object of the invention to provide a connector device which, without requiring any cuts or apertures to be formed in the cantilever spring, enables a cantilever spring to be connected to a suspension means without requiring any rigid or fixed connection to the cantilever spring. In this respect, cuts or apertures inevitably introduce areas of weakness into the cantilever spring which may be 

subject to stress on loading or flexure of the cantilever spring and could ultimately lead to complet failure, i.e. fracture of the cantilever spring. Rigi or fixed connections, such as by welding or rivets (th latter also requiring apertures), are similarly subjec to stress upon loading or flexure of the cantilever

- I ll - CLAIMS
1. A connector device comprising a wire having respective end regions and a central region thereÂ¬ between the end regions being bent so as to substantially encircle respective spaced apart locations intermediate the ends of an elongate spring element or elements to be connected, and the central region extending as a loop between the said end regions.
2. A suspension assembly comprising a connector device according to claim 1 in combination with one or more elongate spring elements stacked one on top of the other.
3. A suspension assembly comprising one or more elongate spring elements stacked one on top of the other with two connector devices according to claim 1 mounted thereon intermediate the ends of the spring element or elements, each connector device consisting of a wire which is bent so as to have first and second end regions substantially encircling the spring element or elements at spaced apart locations and a central region which forms a loop between the first and second end regions, the two connector elements being mounted closely adjacent to each other in overlapping relation such that the loops provided by their central regions 


are substantially aligned and their respective first en regions lie side by side and their respective second end regions lie side by side, the first end regions of the respective connector devices being bent in opposing directions from their respective central regions and the second end regions of the respective connector devices also being bent in opposing directions from their respective central regions.
4. A suspension assembly according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the elongate spring elements are each of differing length with the longest spring element at the top of the stack and the shortest at the bottom.
5. A baby bouncer comprising suspension means, a suspension assembly according to any one of claims 2, 3 or 4, which suspension assembly is connected to and suspended from the suspension means by means of the loop provided by the central region of the or each connector device and a harness suspended from the respective ends of the elongate spring element or elements of the said suspension assembly.
