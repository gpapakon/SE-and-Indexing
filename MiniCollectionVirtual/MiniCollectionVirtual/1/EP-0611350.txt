<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
combination solenoid valve and integral shuttle valve 
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1, 
and in particular to an electrically operated valve 
mechanism for an adaptive braking system. Such a combination is for 
instance disclosed in US-A-4 936 344. Numerous adaptive braking systems have been proposed 
previously. Adaptive braking systems can typically 
include numerous solenoid valves, check valves, flow 
restrictions, shuttle valves, and various types of 
pressure source mechanisms. Fulmer et al U. S. Patent 
No. 4,972,873 illustrates a shuttle valve which includes 
a floating orificed washer. In adaptive braking systems 
which utilize solenoid valves and shuttle valves, it is 
highly desirable to combine structurally a solenoid valve 
with its respective shuttle valve. Combined solenoid 
valve and shuttle valve structures are disclosed in U. S. 
Patent Nos. 4,620,565; 4,844,119; and 4,936,344 which 
shows the shuttle valve element slidable to close off, by 
moving a tappet, a connection between the pressure source 
and brake. The combined structure has the potential for 
greatly simplifying the number and complexity of plumbing 
connections, and substantially reducing the cost of the 
entire system. It is desirable to provide a combination 
solenoid valve and integral shuttle valve structure which 
can be easily assembled and which provides a complexity 
of functions that significantly exceeds the functions 
illustrated in Brown U. S. Patent No. 4,620,565, Martinic 
U. S. Patent No. 4,844,119 and Gilbert et al U. S. Patent 
No. 4,936,344. The complexity of functions that are 
desired may comprise the equivalent of numerous check 
valves, flow restrictions, fluid pressure connections, 
and springs utilized in the check valve structures. The present invention provides solutions to the 
above problems by providing a combination solenoid valve 
and integral shuttle valve, comprising a body having 
therein a bore comprising a first bore section, a second 
bore section, and a third bore section sealingly isolated  
 
from one another at the perimeter of the bore, the 
solenoid valve located within the bore and operable to 
open a valve therein in order to communicate said second 
bore section with said third bore section, the shuttle 
valve disposed sealingly and slidably within an end of 
said solenoid valve and adjacent the first bore section, 
the shuttle valve having at least one through opening, 
characterized in that the one through opening

A combination solenoid valve and integral 
shuttle valve, comprising a body (11) having therein a 

bore (17) comprising a first bore section (71), a second 
bore section (72), and a third bore section (73) 

sealingly isolated from one another at the perimeter of 
the bore (17), the solenoid valve (40) located within the 

bore (17) and operable to open a valve (44) therein in 
order to communicate said second bore section (72) with 

said third bore section (73), the shuttle valve (50) 
disposed sealingly and slidably within an end (61) of 

said solenoid valve (40) and adjacent the first bore 
section (71), the shuttle valve (50) having at least one 

through opening (55, 55A), characterized in that the one 
through opening (55, 55A) permits fluid flow between the 

end (61) of the solenoid valve (40) and the valve (44) of the 
solenoid valve (40), a movable orifice member (90) is 

located between the valve (44) of the solenoid valve (40) 
and the shuttle valve (50), the movable orifice member 

(90) aligned with the through opening (55, 55A) so that 
when the shuttle valve (50) is displaced by fluid 

pressure received at the end (61) of the shuttle valve 
(50) the orifice member (90) is captured between the 

shuttle valve (50) and solenoid valve (40) and fluid flow 
to the valve (44) of the solenoid valve (40) is through 

an orifice (92) of the movable orifice member (90), and a 
pressure source opening (49) in the solenoid valve (40) 

for communicating pressurized fluid with the valve (44) 
of the solenoid valve (40), the shuttle valve (50) 

slidably displaceable by fluid pressure received from a 
master cylinder passage (14) to engage the movable 

orifice member (90) and cause pressurized fluid from the 
pressure source opening (49) to be transmitted through 

the orifice (92) of the movable member (90) and to the 
valve (44) of the solenoid valve (40).  

 
The combination solenoid valve and integral 
shuttle valve in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the 

movable orifice member (90) comprises a washer (90) having 
a laterally extending orifice (92) disposed on a side of 

the washer (90) facing the valve (44) of the solenoid valve 
(40). 
The combination solenoid valve and integral 
shuttle valve in accordance with Claim 2, wherein the 

through opening (55A) has a diameter larger than an aligned 
portion of the movable orifice member (90) so that the 

movable orifice member (90) does not block fluid flow into 
the through opening (55) and toward the end (61) of the 

solenoid valve (40). 
The combination solenoid valve and integral 
shuttle valve in accordance with Claim 3, wherein the valve 

(44) of the solenoid valve (40) comprises a ball valve (44) 
engaged on one side by a spring biased ball washer (45) and 

on the other side by an actuating rod (43) of the solenoid 
valve (40).

shuttle valve in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the first 

bore section (71) includes a pressure source passage (20), 
the second bore section (72) includes a wheel brake passage
