Method of delivering weft threads to a power loom, 
wherein a weft thread supply is wound onto a storage drum 

of a thread regulating wheel and each weft thread within 
a working cycle of the power loom in dependence upon the 

actuation of a controlled retention element is unwound 
over head with a take-off point rotating in a peripheral 

direction of the storage drum, 
characterized in that
 the 
weft thread upon each pick is permanently positively 

delivered by means of the retention element, which 
continuous
ly engages in front of the take-off point and 
is driven so as to rotate, and that in the process the 

retention element is accelerated and decelerated in 
accordance with a speed profile which determines the weft 

characteristic in the power loom. 
Device for delivering weft threads into a power loom (W) 
which has a picking device (E), having a thread 

regulating wheel (F) which comprises a storage drum (1) 
for holding a weft thread supply in readiness, a take-up 

device (2) for supplementing the weft thread supply (V) 
and a controlled retention element (R), which in a 

peripheral direction of the storage drum (1) is drivable 
by a rotary drive (A) so as to execute a rotational 

movement and at least intermittently penetrates the 
circular path (U) of the take-off point of the weft 

thread (Y) which may be unwound over head of the storage 
drum (1) by the picking device (E), 
characterized in that
 
the retention element (R) continuously penetrates the 

circular path (U) in direction of rotation (2') of the 
take-off point in front of the weft thread and is of a 

low mass, and that the rotary drive (A) of the retention 
element (R) is connected to a control device (8), which 

may be used, with simultaneous monitoring of the angular 
position of the retention element (R), to control a 

rotational speed profile (I) of the retention element (R) 
which determines the weft sequence of the power loom (W).  

 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
storage drum (1) is disposed in a stationary manner, and 

that the take-up device (2) comprises a winding element 
(10) which is drivable relative to the storage drum (1). 
Device according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
storage drum (1) is drivable so as to rotate about the 

storage drum axis (11) and simultaneously forms the take-up 
device (2). 
Device according to claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that
 
the rotary drive (A) for the retention element (R) is 

designed so as to be unidirectional or reversible in 
terms of its direction of rotation. 
Device according to claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
the retention element (R) takes the form of a 

substantially radial pointer (7) which is rotatable 
coaxially relative to the storage drum axis (11). 
Device according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the 
pointer (7) is disposed on a drive shaft (6) which is 

coaxial relative to the storage drum axis (11), that the 
drive shaft (6) of the pointer (7) projects from the 

take-off end of the storage drum (1), and that the rotary 
drive (A) is disposed inside the storage drum (1). 
Device according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the 
pointer (7) is disposed so as to be directed radially 

inwards from an arm (16) projecting obliquely outwards 
and towards the storage drum (1) from a hollow drive 

shaft (17) disposed coaxially relative to the storage 
drum axis (11), and that the arm (16), together with the 

hollow drive shaft (16) provided for passage of the weft 
thread (Y) and preferably with the rotary drive (A), is 

disposed at a distance in front of the end face of the 
storage drum (1).  

 
Device according to claims 2 to 8, 
characterized in that
 
the rotary drive (A) comprises a low-mass electric motor 

(M) with an angle-of-rotation decoder or a stepping motor 
(M). 
Device according to claims 2 to 9, 
characterized in that
 
an acceleration- and/or deceleration booster (B) is 

incorporated into the rotary drive (A). 
Device according to claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the 
booster (B) drives the drive shaft (6) of the retention 

element (R). 
Device according to claims 10 and 11,

Device according to claims 2 to 14, 
characterized in that
 
the control device (8) comprises at least one
