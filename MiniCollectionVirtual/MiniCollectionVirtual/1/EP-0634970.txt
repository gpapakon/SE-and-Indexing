<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making 
substantially microcrack - and blister - free composites 
according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1 and 
to an article made by this method. The present invention is directed to a method for making carbon fiber reinforced 
polyimide composites. In recent years, polyimide materials and composites have replaced metals for various 
applications in aerospace and other industries. These materials are desirable because of their 
light weight and resistance to chemical attack. Polyimide composites comprise a polyimide matrix and one or more fillers disposed 
in the matrix. Many different polyimide resins can be used as matrices for polyimide 
composites. Polyimides derived from polymerizable monomeric reactant (PMR) resins have 
been particularly popular. PMR resins initially consist of the monomethylester of 5-nornbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic 
acid (NE), the dimethyl ester of 3,3',4,4'-benzophenone 
tetracarboxylic acid (BTDE), and 4,4'-methylene dianiline. Combining the monomers in 
different mole ratios produces PMR resins of varying molecular weights. For example, 
combining the monomers in a mole ratio of 2:2.087:3.087 produces a resin, known as PMR-15, 
that has a molecular weight of about 1500 when imidized. The "15" in the material's 
name indicates the material's nominal molecular weight. The fillers disposed in the matrix 
can be any conventional materials, including graphite powder and carbon fibers that are 
typically longer than 3 mm (0.125 inches). Polyimide composites can be made into useful articles in several ways. One common 
method is compression molding in which a molding compound, a mixture of the matrix resin 
and filler, is placed in a molding tool. The molding compound is subjected to heat and 
pressure to shape and cure it into a desired article. The composite is often post-cured by 
heating it in discrete steps to remove volatiles that can damage the matrix under later use. 
Although compression molding is very convenient, it can only make composites that have 
simple shapes. Polyimide composites also can be made by transfer molding. Unlike 
compression molding, transfer molding can easily produce complex-shaped composites. In 
transfer molding, the molding compound is placed into a material reservoir where it is heated  
 
to a temperature at which it will flow. A ram transfers the molding compound from the 
material reservoir to a suitably shaped molding tool where the molding compound cures under 
elevated temperature and
