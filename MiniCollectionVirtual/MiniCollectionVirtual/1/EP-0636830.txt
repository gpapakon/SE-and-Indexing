<ABSTRACT>
A unit (20) for controlling the operation of the electric motor 
(7) is provided together with a control device (30), electrically 

connected to the body of the operator (10), to act on the control 
unit (20) via a relay means (40) in such a manner as to halt and 

reverse the rotation of the electric motor (7) following 
conductive contact between the operator's body and the metal 

component (3). For receiving and supporting the feet of the 
operator (10), two conductive plates (12) and (13) insulated from 

the ground are provided in such a position that the operator rests 
his feet via conductive shoes on them when working with the 

machine; said plates (12) and (13) are connected to the control 
device (30); the metal component (3) is electrically connected to 

earth; the support plates (12) and (13) are electrodes for the 
passage of low voltage electric current from one plate to the 

other via the body of the operator (10); the control device (30) 
stops the motor (7) following conductive contact between the 

operator's hands and the metal component (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a safety system which is incorporated 
into a machine having at least one metal component moved by an 
electric motor, to protect the safety of the operator by 
immediately halting the movement of said metal component when 
contact occurs between the operator's hand or another part of his 
body and the metal component, or a machine part in the vicinity 
thereof. In particular, the invention is applied to power machines which 
work on meat by means of a cutting tool operated by an electric 
motor, and in which the meat is manually manipulated by the 
operator, for example in so-called flaying machines. A safety system for meat power machines of the aforesaid type is 
known which acts by immediately halting the motor operating the 
cutting tool when a metal glove worn by the operator, or the 
operator's bare hand, comes into contact with the tool or with 
another conductive part of the machine. Said conducting metal glove is covered by an insulating sheath, 
such as a second glove of plastic sheet, to prevent electrical 
contact with the machine, for example via the meat mass handled by 
the operator. The operator's gloves or two conducting wristbands worn by him are 
electrically connected to a control device which controls a relay 
arranged to instantly disconnect the power when a glove or hand of 
the operator closes a circuit by touching a portion of the  
 
machine. To further reduce the possibility of damage to the operator, the 
control system also comprises means for reversing the polarity of 
the electric motor to cause the motor to rotate in the opposite 
direction to its running direction for a fraction of a turn. A manual switch is operated to restore the configuration of the 
safety system to its configuration prior to its action. A system of this type is duly described in European patent 
application 89202438 (publication number EP 0362937). In the aforesaid system the operator wears about his wrists two 
bands provided with electrodes which are connected, via electric 
wires provided with suitable plugs, to corresponding sockets 
provided in the body of the power machine. Said two wires lead to a control device such as that illustrated 
in Figure 6 of the said European patent application, which is 
housed in the machine base and acts on the electric machine 
operating unit illustrated in Figure 5 of the said patent 
application. When the operator wears the two electrode wristbands, low voltage 
current passes from one band to the other via the operator's body.

<CLAIMS>
An operator safety system for machines with at least one 
metal component (3) moved by an electric motor (7), comprising a 

unit (20) for controlling the operation of the electric motor (7), 
and a control device (30) electrically connected to the body of 

the operator (10) to act on the control unit (20) of the electric 
motor via a relay means (40) in such a manner as to halt and 

possibly reverse the rotation of the electric motor (7) and the 
movement of the metal component (3) following conductive contact 

between the operator's hands and said metal component (3) or a 
metal part in the vicinity thereof, characterised by comprising: 


for receiving and supporting the feet of the operator (10), two 
conductive plates (12) and (13) insulated from the ground and 

provided in the work station of the operator (10) in such a 
position that the operator rests his feet either bare or wearing 

conductive shoes on them when working with the machine; said 
support plates (12) and (13) being connected to the control device 

(30) by respective electric wires (22) and (23); 
the metal component (3), or another metal part in the vicinity 
thereof, being electrically connected to earth; 
said support plates (12) and (13) defining two electrodes for the 
passage of low voltage electric current from one plate to the 

other via the body of the operator (10). 
A safety system as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said shoes (26) comprise a sole of elastomer material having 

relatively high electrical conductivity. 
A safety system as claimed in claim 1, characterised by 
comprising an electrically insulating footboard (14) resting on  

 
the ground and acting as a base for the operator work station, 

said support plates (12) and (13) being arranged on said footboard 
(14). 
A safety system as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that one (13) of said support plates is rockable and acts on a 

switch (11) electrically collected to said control device (30).
