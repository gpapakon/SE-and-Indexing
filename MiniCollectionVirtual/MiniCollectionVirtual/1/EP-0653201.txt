<CLAIMS>
Agent for the permanent shaping of hair
based on a keratin-reducing active substance,

characterised in that it contains a glycerol ester
of cysteine as the keratin-reducing active

substance.
Agent according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the glycerol ester of cysteine is the

monoglycerol ester of cysteine.
Agent according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that it contains a glycerol ester

of cysteine as the sole keratin-reducing active
substance.
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to
3, characterised in that the amount of the

glycerol ester of cysteine contained in the ready-for-use
agent is from 4 to 30% by weight.
Agent according to any one of Claims 1 to

4, characterised in that the pH of the ready-for-use
agent is from 4.5 to 9.0.
