<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device (42) with improved support means 
comprises a support frame having separated frame sections 

(10,12,14,16) supporting a semiconductor die (18). The 
various dimensions of the frame sections (10,12,14,16), other than 

their length, are less than 70 mils. The limited 
dimensions prevents delamination and cracking of 

encapsulating molding compound (40). In other 
configurations, the dimensions may be kept to less than 

70 mils by incorporating openings (60,62,90,92) which 
define the dimensions. The openings and separation of 

frame sections limits the propagation of any 
delamination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
semiconductor devices, and more particularly, to 
semiconductor devices having improved support means. Leadframes to which semiconductor die are attached 
during packaging typically include a flag portion which 
lies below the semiconductor die. The flag portion 
provides a surface for aligning and attaching the 
semiconductor die, and for supporting the die during wire 
bonding to the leads of the leadframe and during molding. 
Conventionally, the flag of the leadframe comprises a 
large square area as big as, or bigger than the die which 
will be attached to it. Such a flag provides very 
effective support to the die during wire bonding. 
However, such a flag gives rise to important 
disadvantages when the leadframe is encapsulated in 
molding compound. When a large square flag is encapsulated in molding 
compound, the molding compound tends to delaminate easily 
from the flag due to mismatch in thermal expansion of the 
molding compound relative to the metal flag, and due to 
moisture induced stresses at metal/molding compound 
interfaces. The greater the surface area of the flag, 
the more severe the delamination. The delamination 
negatively impacts reliability of the device and 
therefore significantly affects yield and customer 
acceptance. A related problem arising from the conventional 
flag configuration is cracking of the molding compound. 
The large areas of delamination described above can trap  
 
water. During reflow soldering conditions the water 
turns to steam, creating steam induced bowing of the 
molding compound below the delaminated area. The steam 
induced bowing creates great stress at the edges of the 
flag which can lead to cracking (this condition is known 
in the industry as "popcorning"). Several approaches have been taken in order to 
alleviate delamination and molding compound cracking 
caused by large surface area leadframe flags. Molding 
compound adheres much better to the bare Silicon of the 
die than to the metal flag. Consequently, one approach 
has been to eliminate the flag altogether, providing a 
flagless leadframe. The flagless leadframes support the 
semiconductor die only along its very edges and in some 
cases only at some specific points along the edges. Such 
a configuration provides inferior support to the die 
during wirebonding and other packaging processes. 
Additionally, such a configuration can not be easily 
adapted to suit various die sizes because the leadframe 
is designed to meet a particular size
