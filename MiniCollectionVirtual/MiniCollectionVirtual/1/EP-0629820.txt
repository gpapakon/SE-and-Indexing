<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a cooking device for a wok pan (1). Until now, it has been possible to heat wok pans in the form of a spherical cap essentially only over an open flame, for example a gas flame. According to the invention, the wok pan is electrically heated in that a mounting adapted to the shape of the wok pan consists of a cuvette (3) in the form of an upwardly open spherical cap for receiving the wok pan and the heating system takes the form of electric induction heating (4).
