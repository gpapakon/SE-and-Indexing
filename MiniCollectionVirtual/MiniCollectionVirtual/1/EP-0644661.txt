<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal
processing apparatus for performing maximum likelihood
decoding and, as one example to a signal processing
apparatus comprising a Viterbi decoder.Conventionally, as an example of maximum
likelihood decoding for realizing satisfactory digital
transmission, Viterbi decoding is known. In Viterbi
decoding, a stored path metric and branch metrics
calculated from an input data sequence are added in
some combinations. A maximum likelihood path is
decided by repeating processing for comparing the sums
and selecting a new path metric, and data is decoded.For this reason, input information to a decoder
must have any correlation to information before and
after the current information. In this case, it is
known that the decoding gain is effectively improved
upon combination with partial response equalization
utilizing an intersymbol interference.A partial response permits a controllable
intersymbol interference, and shapes the spectrum of
codes by utilizing the intersymbol interference,
thereby improving transmission efficiency. The partial response includes some code conversion
schemes. Of these schemes, a scheme called a PR(1,1)
scheme has a feature of reducing noise in a
high-frequency range since it can concentrate an
electric power spectrum of a signal on the
low-frequency side.The basic principle of the PR(1,1) scheme is
described in detail in, e.g., Lender, A., "The
Duobinary Technique for High Speed Data Transmission,"
IEEE Trans. Comm and Electron, Vol. CS-5, pp. 214-218,
May 1963.The combination of the PR(1,1) scheme described in
the above reference with Viterbi decoding derives the
following equations:
mk(s1) = max{mk-1(s0), mk-1(s1) + dk - A/2}mk(s0) = max{mk-1(s1) mk-1(s0) - dk - A/2}
where
s0 and s1 represent two different statuses,mk(sx) represents the metric to a status sx at
time k, anddk represents an input signal at time k.In Viterbi decoding, processing operations based
on equations (1) and (2) are sequentially executed to
estimate a maximum likelihood path, thereby decoding
data. Fig. 1 is a detailed block diagram showing the
arrangement for executing equations (1) and (2) above.
Referring to Fig. 1, an A/D-converted multivalue input
signal dk is input via an input terminal 101, and is
supplied to an addition unit 103 and a subtraction unit
105.The addition unit 103 adds -A/2 to the input
signal dk, and the sum is supplied to and held by a
latch circuit 107.On the other hand, the subtraction unit 105
subtracts -A/2 from the input signal dk, and the
