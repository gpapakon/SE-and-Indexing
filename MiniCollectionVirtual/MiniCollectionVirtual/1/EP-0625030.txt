<ABSTRACT>
A dental implant (10) and method of installing the same which includes the insertion of a root member (18) into the jaw bone (22). The root member is inserted into a predrilled socket in the support bone. A prefabricated oversized implant head (30) is reduced in size and secured to the root member (18) by use of a screw (34). The implant (10) is completed with a thin overlay (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to oral prosthetic 
implants and more particularly a dental implant installed 
by a method involving the reduction in size of an over-sized 
implant head. An implant head as defined in the preamble of Claim 1 is 
disclosed in GB-A-2 176 709. A variety of dental implants have been 
developed to provide replacements for natural teeth 
or as abutments for bridgework. Typically these 
implants are of two-piece construction. One method of installing an implant 
involves first inserting a root portion into the 
bone in a subgingival manner. The implant is then 
left in position for a period long enough to allow 
bone tissue to form around the implant and anchor 
it in position. Because the root is inserted subgingivally, 
the forming bone is protected from any 
weakening or damage that might have occurred if the 
implant had protruded into the mouth where it could 
be knocked and the root jarred. Once the root is 
securely anchored, a removable implant head is 
attached that provides a support onto which a 
tooth-shaped overlay can be secured. One difficulty encountered with prior art 
implants is the fragile nature of the resulting 
artificial tooth. Such a prior art device is seen 
in FIG. 1. The dental implant 10 is located  
 
between two natural teeth 12 and 14. The implant 
10 is formed using a typical submergible post-type 
dental implant system. The implant 10 includes a 
root 16 that may be of one, or two, piece 
construction having an anchor 18 and an implant 
head 20. The root is secured to the jaw bone 22 
and the implant head 20 is generally either 
protected against jarring by use of a healing cap 
during bone growth or secured to the anchor at a 
later stage after bone growth is completed and the 
root is firmly anchored. The implant head 20 of 
prior art systems generally has a top tapered 
portion 24 to which a dental restoration 26 is 
attached. The implant head 20 of Figure 1 is 
illustrative of the implant heads used in prior art 
systems. Seee.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,547,157; 
4,645,453; 4,687,443; 4,713,003; 4,744,753; 
4744,754; 4,744,755; and 4,744,756. The head is 
small in volume relative to the volume of the tooth 
shaped dental restoration 26. The restoration is 
conventionally formed from porcelain or a similar 
material and is therefore inherently fragile. The 
larger the volume of the restoration, the greater 
the tendency for the tooth to crack and 
deteriorate. There are prior art dental prostheses 
that are formed from metal bodies with a ceramic 
overlay

<CLAIMS>
A prefabricated grindable implant head (30) 
adapted to be secured to a preinserted dental implant 

root member (18) together forming a dental implant 
characterised in that the implant head (30) is oversized 

and tooth-shaped. 
An oral prosthesis comprising: 

a root member (18) adapted for insertion in a 
support bone; and 
an implant head (30) according to claim 1 for 
connection to said root member (18) wherein said implant 

head (30) is adapted for reduction in dimensions from 
dimensions greater than those desired to its desired size 

before connection to said root member (18). 
The oral prosthesis of claim 2 wherein said 
implant head (30) is made from a titanium alloy. 
The oral prosthesis of any one of claims 2-3 
wherein said reduction in size is caused by grinding. 
The oral prosthesis of any one of claims 2-4 
further comprising an overlay (36) over said implant 

head. 
The oral prosthesis of claim 5 wherein said 
overlay (36) is formed from porcelain.  

 
The oral prosthesis of any one of claims 2-6 
wherein said implant head (30) provides substantially the 

bulk of the oral prosthesis of which it is to form part. 
The oral prosthesis of any one of claims 2-7 
wherein the root member (18) and the implant head (30) 

are adapted for connection by a screw threaded pin (34) 
extending from the root member (18) and a bore extending 

through the implant head (30), the bore being adapted 
for engagement of the pin (34) therein.
