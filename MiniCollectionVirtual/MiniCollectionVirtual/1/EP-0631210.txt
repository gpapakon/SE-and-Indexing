<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling temperature inside a chamber 
according to a temperature profile which includes a 

plurality of segments, each of which has an increasing or 
decreasing temperature period and a subsequent constant 

temperature period. An operator only needs to inputting a 
target temperature, a first period, and a second period, 

one time each, as parameters, for each sub-input-state 
which is part of an input-state and which is provided for 

each segment, so that the temperature is varied to match 
the target temperature for the first period and that the 

target temperature is maintained for the second period, for 
each segment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method
for inputting a temperature profile and controlling the temperature of an object according to
the preamble part of claim 1. Such a method is used for example for
controlling the temperature of air or liquid (e.g., water or
oil) contained inside a chamber, such as a drier, or an
incubator, or an electric furnace, etc., through
temperature programing according to a temperature profile
which has an increasing or decreasing temperature period
and a subsequent constant temperature period.In order to examine or test samples or substances,
temperature controllers or regulators have been employed
for regulating the temperature inside chambers in which the
samples or substances are heated or cooled one or more
times, according to temperature profiles required therefor
in, for example, the Japanese Industrial Standard.In order to set a temperature program according to the
temperature profile in the above-mentioned temperature
controller, the temperature controller deems that
temperature changes in the chamber include an aggregate of
steps each of which, respectively, has an increase or
decrease temperature period toward a target temperature or
a constant temperature period at the target temperature.
An operator has to set the temperature program for each
step while inputting a specific number of parameters for
each step. For this initializing method, even though some
parameters in different steps overlap, the operator always
needs to set or input the specific numbers for the
parameters for each step. Therefore, when setting a
temperature program which includes many steps in the prior
art, the operator needs to input many parameters
repeatedly, thereby causing input errors or inconvenience
in checking the parameters. From EP-A-110 408 it is known to prestore a plurality of banks
in a RAM, each containing control data. The control data is
input by a plurality of steps, each step defining a period of
increasing, decreasing or constant temperature. Each step requires
input operations with respect to the set temperature and
the set time.The object of the present invention is to provide a method
which facilitates the input operation of a plurality of input
parameters for a period of increasing or decreasing temperature
and a subsequent period of constant temperature.This object is solved by a method comprising the steps of claim
1.In the method for controlling
temperature according to the present invention, it is
deemed that a temperature profile with temperature changes
include

<CLAIMS>
A method of inputting a temperature profile and
controlling the temperature of an object according to

the input profile which includes a period of increasing
or decreasing temperature and a subsequent period of

constant temperature, the method comprising the steps
of:


inputting a target temperature value representing the
final temperature value of the period of increasing or

decreasing temperature,
inputting a first time period value representing the
duration of the period of increasing or decreasing

temperature,
characterized by the following steps
inputting a second time period value as the only
parameter to define the period of constant temperature,

i.e. without inputting a temperature value; and
controlling the temperature during the period of
increasing or decreasing temperature in accordance with

the inputted target temperature value and the first time
period value and during the period of constant 

temperature in accordance with the inputted target
temperature value and the second time period value.
The method of claim 1 wherein a special value is
inputted as the first time period value, representing

the fastest increase in temperature to the final
temperature value.
