<ABSTRACT>
A two stage lift fuel injection nozzle includes a nozzle holder (10) in 
which is defined a chamber (16) housing a pair of springs (15, 24) 

disposed in axial relationship. The springs provide a two stage biasing 
force for a valve member (13) slidable in a nozzle body (11) which is 

secured to one end of the holder. The spring (24) which is adjacent the 
nozzle body engages a reaction member (26) in the form of an annular 

component (30) defining legs (31) which can be expanded outwardly 
into gripping engagement with the wall of the chamber by means of a 

plug (32) which is in screw thread engagement with the component.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fuel injection nozzles of the kind comprising a
nozzle holder to one end of which is secured a nozzle body containing
a fuel pressure actuated valve member which controls the flow of fuel
through an outlet, a chamber defined in the holder and a pair of springs
located in axial relationship within the chamber and operable to provide
a two stage biasing force on the valve member, the one of said springs
remote from the nozzle body engaging a reaction surface disposed at the
end of the chamber remote from the nozzle body and the other of the
springs engaging a reaction element located intermediate the ends of the
chamber.The aforesaid reaction element could be in the form of a step in the wall
of the chamber but this would result in the nozzle holder having an
increased diameter as a result of the provision of the step. It is known
from GB-A-2251891 to form the reaction element as an annular member
which is secured in position in the chamber after the one of the springs
has been assembled into the chamber. The method of securing the
annular member is to deform the wall of the chamber by pressure
applied to the exterior surface of the nozzle holder. This method of
retention requires the appropriate material to be used in the manufacture
of the nozzle holder and this material may not be ideal to withstand the
stresses to which the holder is subjected in use. Moreover, once the
reaction element has been secured it is no longer possible to gain access
to the one spring for the purpose of adjustment. SU-A-947461 describes an arrangement in which a reaction element is
secured in position by means of a screw threaded member which is in
screw threaded engagement with the housing of an injector. The screw
threaded member engages the reaction element at a position spaced from
the axis of the rotation element.The object of the present invention is to provide a fuel injection nozzle
of the kind specified in a simple and improved form.According to the present invention there is provided a fuel injection
nozzle comprising a nozzle holder to one end of which is secured a
nozzle body containing a fuel pressure actuated valve member which
controls the flow of fuel through an outlet, a chamber defined in the
holder and a pair of springs located in axial relationship within the
chamber, the springs providing a two stage biasing force for the valve
member, the one of the springs remote from the nozzle body engaging a
reaction surface disposed at the end of the chamber remote from the
nozzle body, and

<CLAIMS>
A fuel injection nozzle comprising a nozzle holder (10) to one
end of which is secured a nozzle body (11) containing a fuel pressure

actuated valve member (13) which controls the flow of fuel through an
outlet (14), a chamber (16) defined in the holder and a pair of springs

(15, 24) located in axial relationship within the chamber, the springs
providing a two stage biasing force for the valve member (13), the one of

the springs remote from the nozzle body (11) engaging a reaction surface
disposed at the end of the chamber remote from the nozzle body, and

the other of the springs engaging a reaction element (26) located
intermediate the ends of the chamber (16) whereby said

reaction element comprises an annular component (30, 36) which can be
inserted into the chamber to the desired position, characterised in that said annular

component defines a plurality of axially extending, angularly spaced
legs (31, 37), and comprises a plug (32, 35) which can be screw threadedly

engaged with the component to urge the legs (31, 37) outwardly into
gripping engagement with the interior wall of the chamber.
A nozzle according to Claim 1, characterised in that said plug
(32, 35) is provided with a through bore to allow a push rod (23) to pass

therethrough, said push rod acting to transmit the force exerted by said
one spring.
A nozzle according to Claim 2, characterised in that said
through bore is of non-circular section.
A nozzle according to Claim 1, characterised in that said plug
(32, 35) and said legs (31, 37) are provided with cooperating tapered

surfaces which co-act to urge the legs outwardly as the plug is tightened. 
A nozzle according to Claim 1, characterised in that the plug
and component are provided with tapered screw threads.
