<ABSTRACT>
The image forming apparatus in this invention uses 
a positive corona discharger as a main charger. A 

photosensitive material having a charge accepting 
ability per run-off current of at least 40 V/µA from a 

corona discharger (measured by using a discharge length 
of 230 mm and by taking the peripheral speed of the 

photosensitive material as 48 mm/sec) is used, and a DC 
voltage is impressed on the positive corona discharger 

so that the average ozone concentration of an atmosphere 
of the photosensitive material 2 ppm or less and the 

ozone concentration immediately below the corona 
discharger becomes 5 ppm or less to perform main 

charging. According to this apparatus, the amount 
generated of ozone can be decreased, and charging 

unevenness can be prevented to form a good image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus used in a copying machine or a laser printer.
More specifically, it relates to an image forming
apparatus in which the generation of ozone by corona
charging can be prevented effectively and a
photosensitive drum is not scratched and the
photosensitive drum has a long service life.In electrophotographic copying machines, a high
voltage is supplied by corona discharge. When a corona
discharge is generated, oxygen in air is oxidized to
generate ozone. The ozone gives rise to a problem of
environmental pollution, or a problem of deteriorating
the photosensitive material.Many photosensitive materials now in practical use
are negatively charged. In the negatively charged
organic photosensitive materials, the amount of ozone
generated for utilizing a negatively corona discharging
is especially large.Various proposals have previously been made in
order to prevent the generation of ozone by corona
discharge in such an image forming apparatus. For
example, it is known to provide a method which
comprises contacting a soft fibrous contacting piece
with a material to be charged, thereby to electrify the
material (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
269975/1987).However, the method of electrification by
contacting a material to be charged may charge a
photosensitive material drum without using corona
discharge and therefore prevent the generation of ozone. 
But since the contacting piece carries out
electrification by scratching the surface of the
photosensitive drum which is a material to be charged,
it is likely that a scratch may be formed on the surface
of the drum. Furthermore, because a high electric field
is formed between the forward end of the contacting
piece and the photosensitive drum, the current leaks to
form pinholes in the photosensitive drum and leads to
defects such as the short service life of the
photosensitive material drum.Furthermore, it is difficult to contact the
contacting piece uniformly with the surface of the
photosensitive material drum. Although it may be
possible to apply a high voltage to a portion directly
contacted, it is difficult to fully electrify a portion
which the contacting piece does not directly contact.
This leads to a problem that electrification unevenness
occurs in the surface of the photosensitive material
drum.Furthermore, when cleaning is insufficient in the
photosensitive material drum, the toner or the paper
powder remains on the photosensitive material drum.
When a charging treatment is carried out
