<ABSTRACT>
A reactor tube for supercritical water oxidation is designed to supply a thin, 
continuous layer of water along the inner surface of the reaction zone by a wall lining 

formed of laminated platelets individually etched and superimposed to form an array of 
engineered fluid passages through the wall. Each passage includes a flow metering 

channel of closely controlled configuration to impose a preselected level of resistance to 
water flowing through it, plus a distribution section which distributes the water emerging 

from the flow metering channel over the length of a slot-shaped exit port. The exit port is 
arranged in conjunction with neighboring exit ports
 in a array over the inner surface of 
the reactor such that the emerging water forms a continuous film over the surface, thereby 

protecting the surface from corrosion and salts deposition from the supercritical reaction 
medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention lies in the field of supercritical water oxidation, and the apparatus in
which oxidation in a supercritical water medium is performed.Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is the oxidation of waste material in a body
of water under conditions above the thermodynamic critical point of water, which is 374°C
and (221 bar) 2.21 × 107 Pa. Water at supercritical conditions has a density of about
one-tenth that of liquid water, and exhibits properties similar to those of a dense gas,
including miscibility with organics and combustion gases in all proportions. These
qualities result in a single-phase reaction medium containing water, organics and
oxidizer(s), allowing oxidation to proceed without the need for mass transport across an
interface. As a single-phase reaction medium, supercritical water provides a unusually
high level of efficiency in oxidising organics to harmless oxidation ducts. Operation
under these conditions combines the benefits of high density, which permits high reaction
rates at moderate temperatures, with high mass diffusivity and low viscosity. Air pollution
problems are minimal compared with thermal incineration, since the operating temperature
in a supercritical medium is low enough to prevent any significant formation of NOx or
SO2. Furthermore, any acid gases formed by the oxidation can be neutralized in situ to
inorganic salts by the addition of caustic. Since inorganic salts are not soluble in the
supercritical water, they precipitate out, which facilitates their removal. When operated
effectively, SCWO is applicable to waste water streams containing up to 20% organics by
weight, with removal efficiencies in excess of 99.99% at typical reactor conditions of 500
to 650°C and (250 bar) 2.50 × 107 Pa with residence times of 10 to 30 seconds.Temperature control is important in maintaining the desired reaction rate SCWO
and in preventing NOx and SO2 formation. Known methods of achieving this include
controlling the hating value of the aqueous feed stream, either by diluting the stream with
water or adding fuel. Preheating of the feed stream and cooling the reactor are also
effective methods of controlling the temperature profile along the reaction flow path.US-A-5 252 224 describes the use of a tubular reactor to perform oxidation
in water at supercritical conditions. US-A-5 106 513 describes reaction conditions
for a reaction in supercritical water. US-A-4 564 458 describes the use of a pipe
reactor to perform oxidation in supercritical water. Two problems which arise in
