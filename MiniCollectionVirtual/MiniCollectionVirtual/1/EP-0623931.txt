<ABSTRACT>
A synchronous dynamic random access memory device 
latches external command signals for defining the internal 

sequence, and an input circuit (1) produces an internal 
control signal (CTL1) from a system clock signal (CLK) and 

a clock enable signal (CKE) for latching the external 
command signals, wherein the input circuit maintains the 

internal control signal in an active level for a 
predetermined time period regardless of the duty ratio of 

the external clock signal so that a malfunction hardly 
takes place.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor synchronous
memory device and, more particularly, to an input circuit
incorporated in a semiconductor synchronous memory device
for a burst access.A semiconductor memory device forms an electronic
system together with a central processing unit, a gate
array etc. The system components are usually synchronous
with a system clock. However, the semiconductor memory
device is asynchronous with the system clock. Namely, the
semiconductor memory device is connected with the other
system components through a power supply pin, a ground pin,
an address port, an input and output data port and a
control signal port, and a row address strobe signal RAS, a
column address strobe signal CAS, a write enable signal WE
and an output enable signal OE are supplied to the control
signal port for controlling the semiconductor memory
device. The voltage level of each external enable signal 
RAS, CAS, WE or OE defines an internal status of the
semiconductor memory device, and the function starting with
the external enable signal proceeds without the system
clock.Semiconductor device manufacturers have improved the
central processing unit and other system components in data
processing/ transmission speed, and the speed-up has been
also requested for the semiconductor memory device.One of the approaches results in a synchronous
dynamic random access memory device, and the synchronous
dynamic random access memory device is controlled with a
system clock signal as similar to the central processing
unit. In detail, command signals are supplied to the
synchronous dynamic random access memory device in
synchronism with the system clock signal, and the
synchronous dynamic random access memory device decodes the
command signal for controlling the internal sequences.
External address signals and an input data signal are also
supplied to the synchronous dynamic random access memory
device in synchronism with the system clock signal.The synchronous dynamic random access memory device
successively delivers data bits stored therein to a
destination with a single column address signal, and such a 
successive delivery is called as a burst access. The burst
access improves the average access speed four times faster
than a prior art fast page-mode dynamic random access
memory device.As will be understood, the synchronous dynamic random
access memory device is attractive to a system designer
because of a high access speed, and the external command
signals select an internal sequence for the synchronous
dyn
