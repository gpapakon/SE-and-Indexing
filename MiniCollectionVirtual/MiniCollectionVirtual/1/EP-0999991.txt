<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, the winding of a continuous material strip (B) on a series of reel spools (16, 26, 36) using a tape winder (11, 21, 31), at least a moveable return roller (18, 28, 38) and a separation device (10, 20, 30) is made possible due to the fact that the front end (E1) of the material strip (B), formed as a result of actuating the separation device, is brought into winding contact with the reel spool under the effect of an arc-shaped air flow (L) extending on at least one quarter approximately of the spool circumference, at least on virtually the whole width of the reel spool (16, 26, 36) and up to the vicinity of the contact line (K) between the tape winder (11, 21, 31) and the adjacent reel spool. The separation device (10, 20, 30) comprises a vacuum column (200, 300) extending on virtually the whole reel spool length and connected to a guiding wall (203, 303) surrounding like an arc the reel spool on at least one quarter of its circumference, as well as a serrated blade (201, 301) intended to bring into winding contact with the reel spool the front end (E1) of the material strip (B), formed as a result of actuating the separation device, under the effect of an arc-shaped air flow (L) extending on at least one quarter of the spool circumference, at least on virtually the whole width of the reel spool and up to the vicinity of the contact line (K) between the tape winder and the adjacent reel spool.

A method of winding a continuously moving web (B) of material onto a sequence
of winding mandrels (16;26;36) on a winder (15;25;35) comprising a winding

roller (11;21;31), at least one movable deflection roller (18;28;38), and a web-cutting
device (10;20;30), wherein the leading end (E
1
) of the moving web (B) is brought into
winding contact with said winding mandrel by the effect of an arc-shaped stream of air

(L) that extends around at least about one quarter of the circumference of the mandrel at
least approximately over the width of the winding mandrel and up to near contact line

(K) between the winding roller and the adjacent winding mandrel; 
characterized in that

the arc-shaped stream of air (L) is caused by a slit-shaped opening (209;309) extending
across the entire channel width and generating a reduced pressure near the contact line

(K) between the winding roller and the winding mandrel in contact therewith.
The method of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the velocity of the stream of air is at
least two times and preferably at least three times greater than the velocity of the continuously

moving web, wherein the velocity of movement of web (B) preferably is in
the range of 30 - 400 meters per minute.
The method of any of claims 1 - 3, 
characterized in that
 each winding mandrel
(16:26:36) is connected with a central drive.
The method of any of claims 1 - 3, 
characterized in that
 the reduced pressure is
in the region of - 450 to - 900 mBar.
The method of any of claims 1 - 4, 
characterized in that
 formation of the arc-shaped
stream of air L is supported by lateral afflux streams (321;322).
The method of any of claims 1 - 5, 
characterized in that
 web (B) contacts
approximately half the circumference of the winding mandrel (16;26;36) when the web-cutting

device is actuated. 
The method of any of claims 1 - 6, 
characterized in that
 web (B) is held on the
winding roller (11;21;31) provided with openings (213;313) of the roller jacket

(211;311) by means of a reduced pressure applied within the interior of the winding
roller in order to render the web-cutting action substantially free of jolting.
The method of any of claims 1 - 7, 
characterized in that
 for improving contact of
web (B) with the winding mandrel (26) a reduced pressure is applied at the interior of

the winding mandrel provided with perforations (263).
A web-cutting device (10;20;30) of an apparatus (15;25;35) for winding a
continuous web (B) of material onto a sequence of winding mandrels (16;26;36),


characterized in that
 the web-cutting device comprises a vacuum channel
(200;300) extending over the length of the winding mandrels and being connected

with a guide wall (203;303) encompassing, in the shape of an arc, at least
one quarter of the circumference of the winding mandrel (16;26;36), and being

connected with a serrated knife (201;301) so as to bring the leading end (E
1
) of
the moving web (B), formed upon actuation of the web-cutting device under the

effect of an arc-shaped stream of air (L) extending for at least about one quarter
of the circumference of the mandrel over at least approximately the length of the

winding mandrel and up to near contact line (K) between the winding roller and
