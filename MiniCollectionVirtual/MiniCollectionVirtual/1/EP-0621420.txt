<ABSTRACT>
A differential for the axle drive of a motor vehicle has a differential case (2) which consists of thin-walled metal sheets (5, 6) and is freed from the forces caused by the bevelled toothing of the differential and axle-shaft gears (8, 9). The axle-shaft gears (9) are mounted in a separate cage (12) which accepts forces acting in the direction of the axle drive shafts, and the forces acting in the direction of the axle bolt are supported directly, for example, in the crown gear (1). As a result, while having a high stiffness the differential can be manufactured with a reduced weight and at reduced cost.

A differential for the axle drive of a motor vehicle, with a differential housing (2) which
supports a driving wheel (1) and in which an axle pin (7) supporting differential gearwheels

(8) is mounted, and the said differential gearwheels mesh with axle-shaft gearwheels
(9) which are arranged on axle-drive shafts (10) and which are mounted in a cage

(12) absorbing the forces acting in the direction of the axle-drive shafts (10), wherein the
said gearwheels are constructed in the form of bevel gears, 
characterized in that
 the
driving wheel is arranged in the region (16) of the longitudinal axis (
B-B
) of the axle pin
(7), and the differential gearwheels (8) are supported within the driving wheel (1) in the

direction of the longitudinal axis (
B-B
) of the axle pin (7), so as to ensure a direct flow of
power from the driving wheel (1) to the axle pin (7).
