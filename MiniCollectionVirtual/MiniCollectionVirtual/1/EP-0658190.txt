<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for producing detergent tablets for both industrial and household dish-washing machines. The alkaline reacting components, and if required other components, are granulated then sodium metasilicate pentahydrate and/or sodium metasilicate nanohydrate are pressed with additives facilitating the production of tablets.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of detergent tablets 
for institutional and domestic dishwashing machines by 

partial hydration of anhydrous sodium tripolyphosphate to 
tripolyphosphate hexahydrate, mixing the partial hydrate 

with powder-form and substantially anhydrous sodium 
silicate (Na
2
O:SiO
2
 = 1:1 to 1:4), spraying the mixture 
with water or an aqueous silicate solution, granulating 

the whole by agitation and subsequent crystallization, 
optionally with addition of other detergent ingredients, 

bleaching agents or enzymes, adding tabletting aids and 
tabletting the mixture under a pressure of more than 70 

7 MPa (
>
 70 kp/cm
2
), characterized in that around 0.5 to 
15% by weight, based on 100% of the tablet granule 

mixture as a whole, of sodium metasilicate and/or sodium 
metasilicate monohydrate is used as the tabletting aid. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the tabletting aid is added in quantities of around 

8 to 12% by weight, based on 100% of the tablet granule 
mixture as a whole.
