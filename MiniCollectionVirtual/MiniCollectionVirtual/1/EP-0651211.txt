<ABSTRACT>
The wall comprises a frame (1) of rectangular shape delimited on one side by a glass pane (2) and on the other side by the external wall (3) of premises to be heated. The wall (3) is lined with a layer of steel wool (5) or of any other equivalent compressible material which is a good conductor of heat, covered with a layer of black paint. Strips which are good conductors of heat, combined with heat accumulating capsules (9), are stacked one on another inside the frame (1) so that the edges of the strips are brought into contact with the steel wool which they compress against the wall. In order to avoid the formation of cold bridges, the strips are held at a distance from the glass pane.

<CLAIMS>
A solar heating wall comprising latent heat 
accumulator capsules (9; 9', 9"), characterised in that the 

said capsules are arranged so as to constitute good heat 
conducting strips (4), in that these strips are stacked on one 

another and in that they are separated from the ambient air by 
a pane of glass (2). 
A wall according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a frame (1) arranged to be fixed against a building 

wall (3), the pane of glass (2) being mounted on the outer 
side of the frame, the strips (4) of capsules (9; 9', 9") 

being stacked inside the frame. 
A wall according to claim 2, characterised in that a 
layer of steel wool (5) is disposed between the building wall 

and the frame (1) so that the steel wool is compressed against 
the building wall by the inner edges of the strips (4). 
A wall according to the preceding claim, characterised 
in that the steel wool is provided with a coating of dark 

colour. 
A wall according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the whole assembly is arranged so that a 

space exists between the outer edges of the strips (4) and the 
page of glass (2) so as to prevent the forming of cold 

bridges. 
A wall according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the strips (4) are disposed in couples, 

one of the strips of a couple being turned so that its heat 
accumulator capsules (9') are disposed with the heads directed 

upwards, the other strip of the couple being turned so that 
its heat accumulator capsules (9") are disposed with the heads  

 
directed downwards, the two strips of the couple being 

displaced with respect to one another so that their respective 
capsules (9') and (9") fit against one another. 
A wall according to one of the claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that it comprises several layers of strips of 

capsules disposed one behind the other behind the pane of 
glass. 
A wall according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that at least the parts of the capsules (9; 

9', 9") situated on the side of the pane of glass comprise a 
coating of dark colour. 
A wall according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the outer edges (10) of the strips are 

selected alternatively of different widths so that the widest 
edge (10) constitutes a sun-screen which intercepts the summer 

solar radiation (11) but allows the winter solar radiation to 
pass. 
A wall according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the lower face of the strips (4) is 

covered by a coating of aluminium.
