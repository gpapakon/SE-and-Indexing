<ABSTRACT>
A "5x2" compound transmission (10) is disclosed. 
A main section (12) includes a mainshaft (16) and two 

countershafts (34;36). The mainshaft has a spool gear (24) rotatably 
mounted thereon and reverse and four forward gears (26,28,30,32) 

rotationally fixed thereto. A first clutch (54) splined on 
the first countershaft (34) couples one of two countershaft 

gears (42,44) rotatably engaged with a mainshaft gear to the 
first countershaft. A second clutch (56) splined on the 

second countershaft (36) couples one of two countershaft 
gears (48,50) rotatably engaged with the other mainshaft gears 

to the second countershaft. An auxiliary section (14) 
includes an output shaft (58) and third (68) and fourth (80) 

countershafts. The third and fourth countershafts are 
concentric with the first and second countershafts, 

respectively, and are rotatably driven by the spool 
gear. The third and fourth countershafts have gears (64,66,82,84) 

rotatably engaged with the fourth forward mainshaft gear 
and an output shaft splitter gear. A third clutch (78) 

splined on the output shaft couples either a 
rearwardmost mainshaft gear or the splitter gear to the 

output shaft. A fourth clutch (76) splined on the mainshaft 
couples the mainshaft to either the spool gear or the 

rearwardmost mainshaft gear. A 2x5 embodiment of the 
compound transmission is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compound
transmissions including a multispeed main transmission
section connected in series with a multispeed auxiliary
transmission section, and in particular to such a
compound transmission having clutches situated on two
hybrid main section countershafts for selecting main
section gears.Compound change gear transmissions of the type
having one or more auxiliary sections connected in
series with a main transmission section are known in the
prior art. Briefly, by utilizing main and auxiliary
transmission sections connected in series, assuming
proper sizing of the ratio steps, the total of available
transmission ratios is equal to the product of the main
and auxiliary section ratios. By way of example, a
compound change gear transmission comprising a four (4)
speed main section connected in series with a three (3)
speed auxiliary section will theoretically provide
twelve (4x3=12) available ratios.Auxiliary transmission sections are of three
general types: range type, splitter type or combined
range/splitter type. In compound transmission having a
range type auxiliary section, the ratio step or steps
are greater than the total ratio coverage of the main
transmission section and the main section is shifted
progressively through its ratios in each range.
Examples of compound transmissions having range type 
auxiliary sections may be seen by reference to U.S.
Patent No. 3,105,395; U.S. Patent No. 2,637,222; and
U.S. Patent No. 2,637,221.In compound transmissions having a splitter
type auxiliary section, the ratio steps of the splitter
auxiliary section are less than the ratio steps of the
main transmission section and each main section ratio is
split, or subdivided, by the splitter section. Examples
of compound change gear transmissions having splitter
type auxiliary sections may be seen by reference to U.S.
Patent No. 4,290,515; U.S. Patent No. 3,799,002; U.S.
Patent No. 4,440,037; and U.S. Patent No. 4,527,447.In a combined range and splitter type auxiliary
section, or sections, both range and splitter type
ratios are provided allowing the main section to be
progressively shifted through its ratios in at least two
ranges and also allowing the main section ratios to be
split in at least one range.Examples of a compound transmission having a
single combined range/splitter type auxiliary section
may be seen by reference to U.S. Patent No. 3,283,613
and U.S. Patent No. 3,648,546.
