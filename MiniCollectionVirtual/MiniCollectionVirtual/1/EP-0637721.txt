<ABSTRACT>
The air-conditioning process relates, for example, to the interior of a building, in particular an office room, the ceiling of which is at least partly equipped with coolable elements. In the event of work being performed over a limited period of the day, heat is emitted. This heat is dissipated by means of the cooling ceiling (1), a cooling device (3) and a circulating cooling medium and released to the environment. According to the invention, the masonry (2) of the building is used as an additional heat sink; periodically, during times when no work is being done, this heat sink is regenerated by a temperature drop produced by means of the cooling ceiling in the interior room. With the process according to the invention it is possible to create the required comfort conditions using a cooling ceiling which is unable to dissipate an instantaneous heat load.

<CLAIMS>
A method of air-conditioning a building interior, especially office
space equipped with cooling elements (10) of small mass, where during

phases of restricted duration, the socalled comfort phases (100), conditions
of comfort must be maintained or at least the room temperature may

not drop below a certain minimum, the brickwork (2) and/or the appliances
of the building being utilized as an additional heat-sink, whilst during

intervals of time between the comfort phases the aforesaid heat-sink is
regenerated phase by phase through a lowering of temperature generated in

the interior by means of the cooling elements.
A method as in Claim 1, characterized in that
during the regeneration phases the temperature of the cooling

elements (10) is lowered further than during the comfort Phases (100).
A method as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
during the regeneration phases the cooling is carried out under

continuous operation of the cooling equipment (3).
A method as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
during the regeneration phases the cooling is carried out under

intermittent operation of the cooling equipment (3).
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
before the start of a comfort phase (100) conditions of comfort are

reproduced by means of short-term heating.
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
the conveyance of heat from the brickwork (2) and/or the appliances

to the cooling elements (10) is assisted by a movement (6) of air.
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
temperature in the interior is monitored by at least one sensor (41)

and that the operation of the cooling equipment (3) is regulated on the
basis of the temperature measurements.
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
for the room temperature during the comfort phase (100) round about 

21 to 25Â°C is foreseen, and that the temperature of the brickwork (2)
and/or the appliances is lowered so far that at midday it lies some 0.5

to 3 K below the aforesaid room temperature.
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the
air is dehumidified and the temperature of the cooling elements (10)

is kept in the neighbourhood of the dewpoint temperature of the air.
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that
the temperature of the cooling elements (10) is kept below the

dewpoint temperature of the air.
