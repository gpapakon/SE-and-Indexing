<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to SiAlON composites 
and a method of preparing the same. It more particularly 
relates to multi-phase SiAlON materials having at least an 
alpha-SiAlON (α-SiAlON) phase prepared from a multi-cationic 
mixture including oxides and nitrides of 
strontium, where the α-SiAlON phase includes fine elongate 
grains containing strontium, at least one of yttrium or a 
rare earth metal, and at least one other metal such as Ca, 
Mg, Li or Na. Ceramic materials made from SiAlON have recently been 
investigated for high temperature industrial applications 
due to excellent properties, such as high toughness, 
elevated temperature strength, and oxidation resistance. 
Prior art compositions and methods have attempted to rid 
SiAlON materials of glass phases incorporated therein as 
they typically cause high temperature degradation. One 
such attempt focuses upon removing oxide sintering 
additives because they form glasses that remain in grain 
boundaries, and reduce the overall strength of the 
material. A second attempt teaches combining α-SiAlON with 
beta-SiAlON (β-SiAlON) because the β-SiAlON contains 
elongate lath-like microstructures. This leads, however, 
to formation of undesirable residual glass phases in grain 
boundaries between the α- and β- phases. Various multi-phase SiAlON sintered bodies containing 
both α- and β-SiAlON are known in the art. The bodies do 
not, however, have strontium incorporated into the α-SiAlON 
structure. One explanation for the absence of strontium is 
a belief that cationic strontium atoms are too large to fit 
interstitially into positions within the alpha-phase 
matrix.  
 Strontium oxide (SrO) is a known sintering aid that 
may be incorporated into silicon nitride (Si3N4) bodies. 
For example, US-A-4,870,036 teaches an improved Si3N4 
material characterized by high mechanical strength at high 
temperatures and comprising a combination of approximately 
0.5-6.0 percent by weight (wt-%) of SrO, 2.0 to 12.0 wt-% 
Y2O3 and the balance Si3N4. In addition, US-A-4,692,420 
teaches a Si3N4 sintered body consisting essentially of Mg, 
Sr, Ce and Al. These compounds are utilized in the form of 
their respective oxides in combination with the Si3N4. One aspect of the present invention is a SiAlON 
ceramic material that contains a mixture of at least three 
phases: (1) an α-SiAlON phase; (2) a β-SiAlON phase; and 
(3) an intergranular amorphous phase. The α-SiAlON phase 
contains strontium and exists as elongate fine grains and 
fine laths while the
