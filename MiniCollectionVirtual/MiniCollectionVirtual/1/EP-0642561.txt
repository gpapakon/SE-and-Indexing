<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to drilling fluids, more 
especially to such fluids for use in well drilling. Drilling of oil or gas wells normally involves the 
circulation of a fluid through the drill string and out 
through nozzles in the drill bit, the fluid being 
returned through the annular passage formed between the 
drill string and the bore. The fluid cools and 
lubricates the drill, provides a hydrostatic head to 
counterbalance pressures, and removes the cuttings from 
the drill bit. Such fluids are also employed in other 
areas, for example, geothermal drilling, drilling for 
water and scientific drilling. Oil-containing drilling emulsions have been used for 
many years for these purposes. The emulsion may be in 
the form of a water-in-oil or an oil-in-water emulsion, 
in each case normally having finely divided solids 
suspended therein, and containing a variety of additives 
for various purposes, e.g., emulsifiers, surfactants, pH 
control agents, biocides, corrosion inhibitors, weight 
and viscosity regulators, oxygen and sulphur scavengers, 
and fluid-loss additives. The modern technological and ecological demands on 
the oil phase components of drilling fluids now make it 
desirable for the following requirements to be borne in 
mind. The material should be hydrophobic and of low  
 
polarity (to minimize swelling of clays and shales). It 
should have as high a flash point as possible, 
advantageously above 100°C, and preferably above 130°C, 
and more preferably above 150°C. Its viscosity at 20°C 
should be at most 20 cSt (20 mm2/s), advantageously at 
most 15 cSt, especially at most 12 cSt, and preferably at 
most 10 cSt, and it should have a pour point below -15°C, 
to be pumpable between -5°C and -10°C. It should be a 
poor solvent for CO2 and H2S. It should remain 
physically and chemically stable at temperatures up to 
250°C, pressures up to 8000 p.s.i. (about 55 MPa) and 
high pH (up to 10 lb of lime per barrel, about 30 kg of 
lime per m3 or pH 11) while being biodegradable under 
aerobic and preferably under anaerobic conditions. The 
material and its degradation products should have low 
toxicity both to mammals and to marine flora and fauna, 
and little odour. All these desiderata must be borne in 
mind, as well as the prime purpose of the material, to 
provide the best possible lubricity. The oil phase was traditionally provided by a 
hydrocarbon oil, often with an aromatic content; concern 
for the environment has recently required hydrocarbon 
oils used for the purpose to be
