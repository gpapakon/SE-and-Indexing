<ABSTRACT>
A trailer coupling having multiple locks to improve 
security. The coupling includes a body (10) with a 

movable latch (16) for enclosing the ball of a towing 
hitch. The latch is held in ball retaining position 

by a manually operable lock (30) and a key operable 
lock (45). Both the manually operable lock (30) and 

the key operable lock operate to lock the latch 
against movement automatically when the latch is in, 

or is retained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a towing coupling for a 
trailer. Towing couplings are well known devices which 
comprise a body having a socket for receiving the 
ball of a towing hitch and a releasable lock for 
retaining the ball in the socket. Such a towing 
coupling is disclosed in UK Patent Specification 
No.1122279. The known towing couplings include a manually 
operable mechanism which enables the ball of a towing 
hitch to be received into, or removed from, the 
socket in the body. It is thus very easy for anyone 
to steal a trailer by detaching it from the owner's 
vehicle and coupling it to another vehicle. Indeed 
many trailers are, in fact, stolen from car parks, 
trailer parks and the like. There is, therefore, a 
need to improve the security of trailers. A simple solution to this problem is to provide means 
whereby a lock such as a padlock or the like can be 
fitted to the coupling to prevent the releasable lock 
from being operated. An example of this arrangement 
is disclosed in US Patent Specification No.3514980. 
However, this proposal requires the positive action 
of fitting the lock. There is a natural human  
 
tendency not to bother to fit the padlock on every 
occasion that the trailer is coupled to a vehicle 
and, of course, it is on just those occasions when 
the coupling is not so locked that the trailer is 
stolen. The present invention has been made with this problem 
in mind. A towing coupling comprising a body having a socket 
for receiving the ball of a towing hitch, a latch for 
retaining the ball in the socket, the latch being 
movable between a ball retaining position and a ball 
releasing position, means for urging the latch 
towards the ball retaining position, a manually 
operable locking means for retaining the latch in the 
ball retaining position and a key operated locking 
means also for retaining the latch in the ball 
retaining position, characterised in that the key 
operated locking means is permanently secured to the 
body, the normal position of said key operated 
locking means being to hold the latch in the ball 
retaining position and requiring operation with a key 
to release the latch.  
 In a preferred embodiment of the invention the latch 
is pivotally mounted on the body. The manually 
operable locking means preferably comprises means 
linking the latch to the body to prevent movement of 
the latch. The key operated locking means also 
preferably links the latch to the body to prevent  
 
movement of the latch. Both manually operable and 
key operated

<CLAIMS>
A towing coupling comprising a body (10) having 
a socket (14) for receiving the ball of a towing 

hitch, a latch (16) for retaining the ball in the 
socket, the latch being movable between a ball 

retaining position and a ball releasing position, 
means (26) for urging the latch towards the ball 

retaining position, a manually operable locking 
means (34) for retaining the latch in the ball 

retaining position and a key operated locking means 
(45) also for retaining the latch in the ball 

retaining position, characterised in that the key 
operated locking means is permanently se
cured to the 
body, the normal position of said key operated 

locking means being to hold the latch in the ball 
retaining position and requiring operation with a key 

to release the latch. 
A coupling as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
latch is pivotally mounted on the body. 
A coupling as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the manually operable locking means comprises 

means linking the latch to the body to prevent 
movement of the latch. 
A coupling as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the key operated locking means is adapted to 

link the latch to the body to prevent movement of the  
 

latch. 
A coupling as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the key operated locking means comprises a 

plunge lock, said plunge lock comprising a plunger 
which is receivable in a bore in the latch to prevent 

movement of the latch, withdrawal of the plunger from 
said bore requiring operation of the lock with the 

key. 
A coupling as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the key operated lock includes means urging 

it into the locking condition. 
A coupling as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the manually operable locking means includes 

means urging it into the locking condition. 
A coupling as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the key operated locking means automatically 

locks the latch against movement when the latch is 
in, or returns to, the ball retaining position.
