<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is an acceleration sensor (31) having a 
specific insensitive direction along which no acceleration is 

detectable and an insulated case supporting the acceleration 
sensor body (32). The acceleration sensor body (32) is so mounted on the 

insulated case that the insensitive direction is along a 
direction which is neither parallel nor perpendicular to a 

surface of the insulated case to be mounted on an external 
device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acceleration sensor as stated in the
preamble of claim 1. An acceleration sensor of this kind is already known
from DE-A-2 316 130. This acceleration sensor comprising: an acceleration
sensor body having a specific insensitive direction along which no acceleration
is detectable; and a case supporting said acceleration sensor
body and having a mounting surface to be mounted on an external device,
said acceleration sensor body being so supported by said case that said insensitive
direction is along a direction being neither parallel nor perpendicular
to said mounting surface of said case. In general, an acceleration sensor employing a bimorph
piezoelectric element is known in the art. Another example of such an
acceleration sensor is now described with reference to Fig. 1.An acceleration sensor 1 comprises a sensor body 2 which is
formed by a bimorph piezoelectric element, and an insulated case
3. The acceleration sensor 1 is generally mounted on a mounting
substrate 4, as shown in Fig. 1.The sensor body 2 is formed by a combination of first and
second piezoelectric ceramic plates 5 and 6. First and second
signal electrodes 7 and 8 are formed on outer major surfaces of
the first and second piezoelectric ceramic plates 5 and 6
respectively. The first and second signal electrodes 7 and 8 are
opposed to each other through the piezoelectric ceramic plates 5
and 6 at a central portion of the sensor body 2. Further, an
intermediate electrode 9 is formed between the first and second
piezoelectric ceramic plates 5 and 6. Namely, the first and
second piezoelectric ceramic plates 5 and 6 are pasted to each 
other through the intermediate electrode 9. The intermediate
electrode 9 is formed along the portion where the first and
second signal electrodes 7 and 8 are opposed to each other.The first and second piezoelectric ceramic plates 5 and 6
are polarized as shown by broken arrows in Fig. 1. In other
words, the first and second piezoelectric ceramic plates 5 and 6
are uniformly polarized along thicknesses thereof, in directions
which are opposite to each other.The first and second signal electrodes 7 and 8 are drawn out
on first and second ends along the longitudinal direction of the
sensor body 2 respectively.The insulated case 3 has first and second holding members 10
and 11 and flat plate type case substrates 12 and 13. The first
and second holding members 10 and 11 are fixed to outer major
surfaces of the sensor body 2 in portions close to both ends
thereof respectively. The
