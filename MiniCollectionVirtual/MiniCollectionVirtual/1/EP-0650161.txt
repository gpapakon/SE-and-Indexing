<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for producing an objective lens actuator in which a first resin 
portion (52) which is a stationary portion and a second resin portion (50) which is a 

movable portion on which an objective lens is to be mounted are integrally formed to 
plate-like bases (40, 42) in which a plurality of elastic support portions (60, 62, 70, 72) 

for movably supporting the movable portion (50) relative to the stationary portion (52) 
in a direction of an optical axis of the objective lens are formed in parallel with each 

other, so that the first resin portion (52) and the second resin portion (50) are connected 
to each other by the elastic support portions (60, 62, 70, 72). At the same time, 

connecting portions (80, 82, 84, 86, 90, 92, 94, 96) provided between each of the 
elastic support portions (60, 62, 70, 72) and each plate-like base (40, 42) portion are 

formed so as not to overlap each other as viewed in the direction of the optical axis of 
the objective lens. The plurality of elastic support portions (60, 62, 70, 72) are cut 

away from the bases (40, 42) at the connecting portions (80, 82, 84, 86, 90, 92, 94, 
96).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing an objective lens actuator. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a method for producing an objective lens actuator
having a plurality of elastic support portions.An optical pickup apparatus is used to reproduce or record an information signal of, for
example, a so-called compact disc (CD) or a magneto-optical disc. The optical pickup
apparatus includes a semiconductor laser device used as a light source, an objective lens, an
optical system and a photodetector. A light beam emitted from the semiconductor laser device
is converged on a recording surface of the optical disc through the optical system by the
objective lens. The light beam reflected from the optical disc is separated from the light beam
emitted from the semiconductor laser device and is introduced into the photodetector by the
optical system. A position of the objective lens in the optical axial direction is adjusted so
that the light beam emitted from the semiconductor laser device may track a displacement of
the optical disc in a direction perpendicular to a surface of the optical disc, which
displacement is generated by a warpage or the like of the optical disc, and the light beam is
focused on the recording surface of the optical disc. At the same time, a position of the
objective lens in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis of the objective lens is adjusted 
so that a position of a spot, on the optical disc, of the light beam emitted from the
semiconductor laser device may track an eccentricity of the optical disc or a serpentine motion
of a track formed on the optical disc. The focus position of the light beam emitted from the
semiconductor laser device and the spot position on the recording surface of the optical disc
may be performed by adjusting the position of the objective lens in the optical axial direction
and the position of the objective lens in the direction perpendicular to the optical axis. An
electromagnetic drive type actuator is used for the positional adjustment of the objective lens.The actuator includes a bobbin on which the objective lens is mounted, a plurality of
elastic support members and a drive unit for generating a drive force. The bobbin is supported
by the elastic support members so that the position of the objective lens in the optical axis of
the objective lens, i.e., the focus position, and the position of the objective lens in the
direction perpendicular to the optical axis of the objective lens, i.e., the tracking position

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing an objective lens actuator, comprising the following
steps of:


arranging at least two plate-like bases (40, 42) in parallel with each other, each
of said plate-like bases (40, 42) including a frame portion having a rectangular opening

portion, at least two arm portions (60, 62, 70, 72) provided in parallel with each other
within said opening portion, and a plurality of connecting portions (80, 82, 84, 86, 90,

92, 94, 96) for connecting each of opposite ends of each of said arm portions (60, 62,
70, 72) and said frame portion (40, 42) with each other, each of said arm portions (60,

62, 70, 72) being formed so as to traverse the opening portion;
forming a first resin portion (52) in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal
direction of said arm portions (60, 62, 70, 72) between said two arm portions, and a

second resin portion (50) in which an objective lens is mounted at a position away from
said first resin portion (52); and
cutting each of said arm portions (60, 62, 70, 72) away from said frame portion
(40, 42) at said connecting portions (80, 82, 84, 86, 90, 92, 94, 96) at positions which

are different from each other,

characterized in that said connecting portions (80, 82, 84, 86, 90, 92, 94, 96) are
formed so as not to overlap each other as viewed in a direction perpendicular to a

planar surface of said plate-like bases (40, 42).
The method according to claim 1, wherein said at least two arm portions are
simultaneously cut away from said bases (40, 42) by a press machine (120).
The method according to anyone of claims 1 or 2, wherein said first portion (52)
and said second portion (50) are integrally formed of synthetic resin with said base (40,

42) by insert molding.
