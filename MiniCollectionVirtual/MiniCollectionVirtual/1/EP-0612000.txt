<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a sheet original 
supply apparatus (2) comprising convey means (7) for conveying 

a sheet original (P) at a reading portion, and supply means (17) 
arranged upstream of the convey means (7) and adapted to 

send the sheet original (P) to the convey means (7), wherein 
after the sheet original (P) starts to be conveyed by 

the convey means (7) and before the sheet original (P) is read 
at the reading portion, the restraint of the sheet 

original (P) by the supply means (17) is released.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet 
original supply apparatus for supplying a sheet 
original to a predetermined position such as a reading 
portion of an image forming apparatus such as a copying 
machine, a laser beam printer and the like and for 
resting such a sheet original on the predetermined 
position. Further, the present invention relates to 
a reading apparatus and an image forming apparatus. Fig. 26 shows an example of a conventional 
sheet original supply apparatus. In Fig. 26, a sheet 
original P is supplied from an original tray 413 to a 
platen glass 422, where an image on the sheet original 
is read by an optical system 421 of a copying machine, 
and then the sheet original is discharged onto a tray 
423. In particular, a separation means 414, 415, 
supply rollers 416 for effecting regist correction, 
relay rollers 417, and an image tip end sensor Sl are 
arranged in order, and, by means of such supply means, 
the original is passed through the platen 422 from the 
right, during which the reading-through (in which the  
 
image is read while the sheet original is being moved) 
of the sheet original is performed to form the image. However, with the above-mentioned conventional 
arrangement, when the reading-through of the sheet 
original is being effected while the sheet original 
is being passed through the platen 422, as a trailing 
end of the sheet original leaves the relay rollers 417, 
the load fluctuation acts on the sheet original P, 
thereby causing the discrepancy of image. Further, in the above-mentioned conventional 
technique, the sheet originals P are separated one by 
one by the separation means 414, 415. When the skew-feed 
of the sheet original is corrected by abutting the 
separated sheet original against a nip between the 
supply rollers 416, since the rear portion of the sheet 
original is still remaining in the separation means 414, 
415 and the separation roller 415 and the separation 
belt 414 are being rotated in directions shown by the 
arrows, respectively, as the sheet original is pulled 
by the supply rollers 416, the sheet original is 
subjected to a load, with the result that there arises 
slip between the supply rollers 416 and the original, 
thereby worsening the regist correction (i.e., causing 
the error in a sheet feeding amount of the sheet 
original fed by the supply rollers 416). Further, a sheet feed path from the supply 
rollers (regist correction rollers) 416 to the image  
 
reading portion 422 becomes long because the relay 
rollers 417
