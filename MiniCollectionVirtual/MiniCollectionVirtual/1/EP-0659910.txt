<ABSTRACT>
In order to easily and accurately manufacture a micromachine comprising a 
member which is made of a single-crystalline material and having a complicated 

structure, an uppermost layer (1104) of a single-crystalline Si substrate (1102) 
whose (100) plane is upwardly directed is irradiated with Ne atom currents from 

a plurality of prescribed directions, so that the crystal orientation of the uppermost 
layer (1104) is converted to such orientation that the (111) plane is upwardly 

directed. A masking member (106) is employed as a shielding member to 
anisotropically etch the substrate (1102) from its bottom surface, thereby forming 

a V-shaped groove (1112). At this time, the uppermost layer (1104) serves as an 
etching stopper. Thus, it is possible to easily manufacture a micromachine having 

a single-crystalline diaphragm having a uniform thickness. A micromachine having 
a complicated member such as a diagram which is made of a single-crystalline 

material can be easily manufactured through no junction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a capable semiconductor device such as a 
micromachine, a solar battery having a high energy conversion efficiency, a volatile 
or a nonvolatile memory, a load of a memory cell of an SRAM, a field effective 
thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as "TFT") which is used as a display 
device of a wide-screen, high-precision active-matrix type liquid crystal display 
and a liquid crystal display which comprises a pixel electrode and a thin film 
transistor. The present invention also relates to a method for manufacturing such 
a semiconductor device. A prototype of a micromachine, which is typically an apparatus of fine 
dimensions in the units of micrometers or less having a mechanical motion 
mechanism, is prepared by redeployment of a semiconductor technique mainly 
implementing simultaneous formation on a semiconductor wafer by transfer of a 
mask pattern or the like. Fig. 77 is a front sectional view showing a sectional structure of an 
electrostatic motor 3000 which is manufactured by a conventional method. In this 
electrostatic motor 3000, a nitride film (Si₃N₄ film) 3004 is formed on a single-crystalline 
Si substrate 3002, and a rotary shaft 3014 and a stator 3010 of 
polycrystalline Si are fixedly formed on the nitride film 3004, while a ring-shaped  
 
rotator 3008 of polycrystalline Si is stopped to the rotary shaft 3014 with a 
clearance. Thus, the rotator 3008 is rotatable about the rotary shaft 3014. The stator 3010 is formed by a plurality of members, being electrically 
isolated from each other, which are radially arranged at prescribed intervals to 
enclose the rotator 3008. Alternating voltages which are out of phase with each 
other are independently applied to these members of the stator 3010. Consequently, 
electrostatic attractive or repulsive force is generated between the stator 3010 and 
the rotator 3008, and a bearer of such force is successively moved between the 
respective members, thereby rotating the rotator 3008. It is reported that the rotator 
3008 is 100 µm in diameter and 2.5 µm in thickness. Fig. 78 is a process diagram showing a certain stage in a method of 
manufacturing the electrostatic motor 3000. In manufacturing of the electrostatic 
motor 3000, a technique of forming sacrifice layers and etching the same is 
employed in order to isolate the rotator 3008, the stator 3010, the rotary shaft 3014 
and the nitride film 3004 serving as an underlayer from each other and defining 
clearances therebetween. In order to

obtained through a beam irradiation apparatus comprising: 
   plasma forming means for forming a plasma, 

   divergent magnetic field applying means for applying a divergent magnetic 
field to said plasma being formed in said plasma forming means for accelerating 

said plasma, thereby obtaining said gas beam or said gas beams, and 
   an auxiliary coil being set around a target of irradiation or a portion of a 

path of said plasma being upstream beyond said target of irradiation, 
   said auxiliary coil forming a secondary magnetic field so that said divergent 

magnetic field is attenuated to a degree of expelling electrons substantially 
contributing to formation of a plasma sheath from a path of said plasma among 

those in said plasma on a position of said target of irradiation or said upstream 
portion.
