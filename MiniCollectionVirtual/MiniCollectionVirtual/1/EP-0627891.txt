<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device (1) useful in receiving, dispensing and measuring a pourable product which is contained in a flexible bag (4) and the closing of the flexible bag with the device (1). In particular, the present invention relates to a closing means (10, 12, 16) which is part of the device (1). The closing means is a constriction opening (10, 12, 16) such as a recess (10) of a slit (11), an orifice (16) formed by a clip (17), or a groove (12) which is capable of comprising and constricting that part of a flexible bag (4) which is forming the product access opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device useful in
receiving, dispensing and measuring a pourable product which
is contained in a flexible bag and the closing of the
flexible bag with the device. In particular, the present
invention relates to a closing means which is part of the
device. The closing means is a constriction opening such as a
recess of a slit, an orifice formed by a clip, or a groove
which is capable of comprising and constricting that part of
a flexible bag which is forming the product access opening in
said flexible bag and thereby closes the flexible bag against
the environment. The present invention further is directed
towards the use of the device for closing a flexible bag in
particular, a flexible bag containing granular products. Bags containing pourable products are well known and
often used in the art of packaging. For example, granular
detergents are often packed in thin film plastic bags or
paper bags. It also has become common to provide liquid or
pourable granular products in plastic bags in order to reduce
the amount of packaging material for environmental, technical
or economical reasons. To access the products contained in
such bags, they are usually opened by cutting away a corner
or an edge of the bag. This however raises the problem of
closure of the bag after taking out the desired amount of
product at a particular time.Products supplied in bags are usually not in the amount
of a single portion. Therefore a device for receiving,
dispensing and preferably measuring a portion of the product,
like a scoop or a cup or a spoon, is required. The need for
measuring the product amount has increased drastically since
compact or ultra versions of many granular detergents but
also of for example ground coffee are becoming increasingly
popular. For simplicity this "device for receiving the
product" hereinafter will be referred to as "scoop" even so a
variety of other devices are known and may be used.For convenience a scoop most often is included in or
with each bag of product. The scoops used in this context
usually also include a handle to manipulate the cavity in
which product can be held. The lifetime of such scoops is
usually not designed to be more than the usage time of the
total amount of product contained in a single bag. However,
due to the technical stability requirements, particularly for
sticky or granular products, the material of which scoops are
made, would allow to use them repetitively or for additional
purposes. Scoops having a tapered slit in their handle in

<CLAIMS>
A scoop (1) for receiving and dispensing a pourable
product and closing a flexible bag (4) containing said

pourable product, said scoop (1) comprising

a first part (2) having a cavity (5) for receiving
and dispensing of said pourable product
a handle (3) joined to said first part (2) to
manipulate said cavity (5) during receiving and

dispensing of said pourable product
a constriction opening (10,12,16) to close said
flexible bag (4) by constricting that part of said

flexible bag which is forming the product access
opening in said flexible bag (4), characterized in that

the constricting opening is a slit (11) which starts at its mouth
and ends in the recess

(10) or a clip (17) forming an orifice (16) or a groove (12)
or a combination thereof.
A scoop (1) according to claim 1 characterized in that
said groove (12) comprises a clamp (13).
A scoop (1) according to either of the preceding claims
characterized in that said handle (3) comprises said

constriction opening (10,12,16).
A scoop (1) according to any of the preceding claims
characterized in that said cavity (5) comprises dosing

lines (7), the free end (8) of the side of said cavity
(5) opposite said handle (3) forms a sharp edge (6) and

said scoop (1) is made of polyethylene terephtalate or
combinations thereof. 
Use of the scoop (1) of Claim 1 to close a flexible bag
(4).
Use of a scoop (1) according to claim 5, characterized
in that said product access opening of said flexible

bag (4) is closed by pulling the material forming said
product access opening into said constriction opening

(10,12,16) of said scoop (1).
Use of a scoop (1) according to claim 5 or 6,
characterized in that said scoop (1) comprises a groove

(12) and a clamp (13) to close a flexible bag (4) by
folding the product access opening of said flexible bag

(4) onto itself to form a folded edge (9), increasing
the clamp (13) opening by pressing the side walls (21)

of the first part (2) together and sliding said groove
(12) over the folded edge (9).
Use of a scoop (1) according to claim 5 or 6,
characterized in that said scoop (1) comprises an

orifice (16) formed by a clip (17) to close a flexible
bag (4) by folding the product access opening of said

flexible bag (4) onto itself to form a folded edge (9)
and placing the orifice (16) around the folded edge

(9).
Use of a scoop (1) according to claim 5,6,7 or 8,
characterized in that said flexible bag (4) is made of

a film selected from polymer films, paper, metal films
or combinations thereof.
