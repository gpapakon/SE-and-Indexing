<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet
conveying apparatus used with a recording apparatus
such as a printer, a copying machine, a facsimile and
the like, and more particularly relates to a sheet
conveying apparatus wherein a driving force from a
drive means is switched between a sheet supply means
and a convey means.The present invention further relates to a
drive transmitting mechanism used with a recording
apparatus (printer) or an image forming apparatus such
as a copying machine, a facsimile and the like, for
example, acting as an information outputting apparatus
of a computer, and more particularly relates to a
driving force transmitting mechanism for effecting
drive transmission by a planetary gear.In the past, recording apparatuses used with a
printer, a copying machine, a facsimile and the like or
recording apparatuses used as an output equipment for
a composite system or a work station including a
computer or a word processor are designed so that an
image (including a character, a symbol or the like) is
recorded on a recording material such as a paper sheet 
or a thin plastic film (for example, an OHP sheet).
These recording apparatuses can be grouped into ink jet
recording type, wire dot recording type, heat-sensitive
recording type, heat-transfer recording type, laser
beam recording type and the like in accordance with
the kinds of recording means to be used.Among the above-mentioned recording apparatuses,
in a recording apparatus of serial type in which main
scan is effected along a direction perpendicular to a
conveying direction of the recording material (sub-scan
direction), after the recording material is set
on a predetermined recording position, the image
(including character, symbol or the like) is recorded
on the recording material. After one-line recording
is finished, the recording material is conveyed by a
predetermined amount (sub-scan) and then a next one-line
recording is effected (main scan). By repeating
these operations, the images are recorded on the
recording material within a desired recording range.
On the other hand, in a recording apparatus of line
type in which the recording is effected only by using
the sub-scan (i.e., by conveying the recording
material only in the conveying direction), after the
recording material is set on a predetermined recording
position, the recording for one-line is effected in
bloc and then the recording material is conveyed by a
predetermined amount (pitch convey). By repeating 
these operations, the images are recorded on the
recording
