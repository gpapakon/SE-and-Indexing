<ABSTRACT>
A new and improved apparatus for biasing the 
direction of air-bag deployment includes a box-shaped 

guide member (40), preferably of fabric construction, 
and attached to an air-bag module (24) and folded to 

overlie a folded air-bag (30). The box-shaped guide 
member (40) has an open bottom and is erected to the 

box shape upon deployment of the air-bag (30) through 
an air-bag opening (18). The box-shaped guide member 

(40) has an open end wall at the inboard side thereof 
to define a lateral deployment opening through which 

the air-bag (30) may be deployed laterally, and a top 
deployment opening through which the air-bag (30) may 

deploy upwardly and rearwardly towards a seat 
occupant. The box-shaped guide member (40) also 

includes a top flap (50) which selectively closes off 
the top deployment opening of the guide member (40) to 

bias and divert the deploying air-bag (30) through the 
lateral opening until the top flap (50) is unfolded to 

an extended position opening the top opening to permit 
the further deployment of the air-bag (30) through the 

top opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle having 
an air-bag and inflation apparatus as specified in the 
preamble of claim 1. It is well-known in motor vehicles to 
provide an air-bag assembly which is mounted beneath 
an opening in the instrument panel. A door closes the 
air-bag deployment opening and is moved from a closed 
position to an open position by the deploying air-bag. The prior art has recognised that the 
deployment of an air-bag towards an occupant seating 
position is dependent upon factors such as the size 
and shape of the air-bag, the placement of tethers 
inside the air-bag to control the deployed shape of 
the air-bag, the magnitude and duration of inflation 
pressure and the placement of vent openings in the 
air-bag. The prior art has also recognised that an 
external deployment mechanism may be employed to 
control the deployment of an air-bag (EP-A-0 453 740). An apparatus in a vehicle according to the 
present invention, is characterised by the features 
specified in the characterising portion of claim 1. The present invention provides a new and 
improved apparatus for biasing the direction of 
air-bag deployment. According to the invention, a 
box-shaped guide member, preferably of fabric 
construction, is attached to an air-bag module and is 
folded to overlie a folded air-bag. The box-shaped guide member has an open 
bottom and is erected to the box shape upon deployment 
of the air-bag through an air-bag opening. The 
box-shape has an open end wall at the inboard side 
thereof to define a lateral deployment opening through 
which the air-bag may be deployed laterally, and a top  
 
deployment opening through which the air-bag may 
deploy upwardly and rearwardly towards an occupant of 
a seat in a motor vehicle in which the air-bag is 
mounted. The box-shape also includes a top flap which 
selectively closes off the top deployment opening of 
the box to bias and divert the deploying air-bag 
through the lateral opening until the top flap is 
unfolded to an extended position opening the top 
opening to permit the further deployment of the 
air-bag through the top opening. Accordingly, the object, feature and 
advantage of the invention resides in the provision of 
an air-bag biasing mechanism which is operative, when 
held in a horizontal folded position, to initially 
deploy the air-bag in a lateral direction and then to 
permit further deployment of the air-bag in an 
unbiased upward and rearward direction towards said 
occupant. These and other features, objects and 
advantages
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for selectively initiating the 
deployment of an air-bag (30) laterally relative to a 

seated occupant in a vehicle in which the air-bag (30) 
is stored in a folded condition forwardly of the 

seated occupant and is deployable, by the introduction 
of pressurised inflation gas into the air-bag (30), to 

an occupant-restraining position relative to the 
seated occupant, characterised in that the apparatus 

includes a deployment guide member (40) having a 
normal stored position overlying the folded air-bag 

(30) and which is deployable toward the occupant by 
the deploying air-bag (30), said guide member (40) 

having at least an end wall (46) pleated inwardly to 
lie on top of the folded air-bag (30), and a top flap 

(50) hingedly connected to the end wall (46) and 
folded to lie on top of the pleated end wall (46) in a 

closed top position so that initial deployment of the 
air-bag (30) unpleats the end wall (46) and permits 

the top flap (50) to shift towards the occupant and 
then bias initial deployment of the air-bag (30) 

laterally relative to the occupant when the top flap 
(50) is held in a folded position, until the eventual 

unfolding of the top flap (50) permits subsequent 

unbiased deployment of the air-bag (30) towards the 
occupant. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, in which 
the air-bag (30) is stored beneath a vehicle 

instrument panel (10) and is deployable through an 
opening (18) in the panel (10), wherein the deployment 

guide member (40) is formed of flexible foldable 
material and includes a rearward wall (44) and a side 

wall (42) attached to the vehicle and folded on top of 
the folded air-bag (30) so that the rearward and side 

walls (42,44) are deployed through the panel opening  
 

(18) ahead of the deploying air-bag (30) to define an 
air-bag deployment chute having a lateral deployment 

opening opposite the end wall (46) and a top 
deployment opening which registers with the panel 

opening (18) of the instrument panel (10); said end 
wall (46) having said top flap portion (50) extending 

beyond the dimensional extent of the rearward wall 
(44) and being folded on top of the folded air-bag 

(30) in the stored position so that the flap portion 
(50) closes the top opening of the chute to bias the 

air-bag deployment through the lateral opening until 
the flap portion (50) is unfolded to an extended 

position opening the top opening of the chute to 
permit further deployment of the air-bag (30) through 

the top opening. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, in which 
the lateral deployment opening is positioned at the 

end of the side and rearward walls (42,44) opposite 
the end wall (46). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, in which 
the air-bag (30) is stored beneath a vehicle panel 

(10) and is deployable through an opening (18) in the 
panel (10); wherein the deployment guide member (140) 

is deployable through the panel opening (18) by the 
deploying air-bag (30); said guide member (140) having 

a box shape with an open bottom admitting the 
deploying air-bag (30) and forward, rearward and 

outboard side walls (142,144,146) deployable from the 
stored position on top of the folded air-bag (30) to a 

deployed position; the top flap (150) being hingedly 
connected to the outboard side wall (146) for movement 

between the closed top position and an open top 
position, and there is an open inboard side to the 

guide member (140) through which the air-bag (30) 
obtains initial deployment laterally of the occupant  

 
when the top flap (150) is held in the closed top 

position.
