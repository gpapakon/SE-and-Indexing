<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fastening railway 
rails. The applicant's previous inventions, rail clips 
commonly referred to respectively as a "P-R" clip 
(disclosed in GB-861,473) and an "e"-clip (disclosed in 
GB-1,510,224), have both been successful for many years, 
providing low-cost rail fastenings that have been widely 
used in many countries around the world. These clips may 
be installed into shoulders alongside the rail either 
manually, using a sledgehammer to drive the clip into the 
shoulder, or automatically by a clip driving machine. 
Whilst automatic clip installation is obviously more 
desirable, being quicker and less labour-intensive, it 
can be a fairly complex process, requiring accurate 
positioning of the clip relative to the shoulder in order 
to achieve an adequate rail fastening. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a railway rail fastening clip suitable 
for holding down a railway rail, the clip being formed of 
a rod of material bent so as to be approximately M-shaped 
in plan and having a portion formed to cooperate with 
part of a clip anchoring device so as to locate the said 
clip at a desired pre-assembly position with respect to 
the said clip anchoring device when mounted thereon, 
characterised in that the said portion is provided by at 
least one of the legs of the M which has first locating 
means thereon for cooperating with second locating means 
provided on the said part of the clip anchoring device, 
and in that at least one abutment surface forms one of 
the first and second locating means and at least one 
cooperating projection forms the other of the first and 
second locating means, both the abutment surface and one 
face of the cooperating projection being acutely inclined 
in one sense to the longitudinal axis of the leg of the M 
having said first locating means thereon such that the 
said one face of the said cooperating projection abuts  
 
against the said abutment surface so as to locate the 
clip at the said pre-assembly position, but such that 
driving of the clip in either of two directions parallel 
to the said axis forces said projection out of contact 
with said abutment surface, no adjustment of the said 
clip anchoring device being required in order to do so. Both DE-U-8906790.8 and DE-U-8804426.2 show railway 
rail fastening clips which are approximately M-shaped in 
plan. The clip of DE-U-8906790.8 has inner legs which 
cooperate with an anchoring bolt for holding the clip in 
position on the rail, but
