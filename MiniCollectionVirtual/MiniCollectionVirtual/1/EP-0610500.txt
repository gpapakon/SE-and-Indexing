<ABSTRACT>
An operation room is kept within the turning 
radius even when its door is opened while not only 

the size of the opening of the door is secured but also 
wide space is maintained inside the room. A side (2a) 

of the operation room (2) that is opposite to a boom 
of an operation machine mounted on a turning table 

(1) is formed into an outwardly curved arc including 
the door (3), and the door (3) is moved by sliding to 

be freely opened and/or closed, with its opened position 
being provided on the outer side of the operation 

room (2) within the turning radius (R) of the 
turning table (1)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a construction machine, more specifically, an operation
room of a construction machine such as a power shovel which
has a turning table.A hydraulic power shovel has a turning table 22 on a
crawler 21 as shown, for example, in Fig. 6 and is provided
with an operation room 23, an engine room 24 and a
collapsible working machine 25. The straight-shaped operation room 23
installed on such a vehicle is located off the center of
the turning table 22 as shown, for example, in Figs. 7 and
8, and a door 26 of this operation room 23 for accessing of
an operator is adapted to be opened by turning it in an
arrow direction as shown in Fig. 7 in case of a hinged type
door and by sliding it up to a position shown with a 2-dotted
broken line as shown in Fig. 8 in case of a slide
type door. However, there has been a problem that, if the
hinged type door is provided with a large-sized opening,
the door comes out of the turning radius R of the upper
turning body when the door is opened and fixed and may be
damaged by an external obstacle during work and, in the
case of the slide type door, rails and rollers to be used
for sliding the door are protruded into the operation room 
whereby the internal space of the operation room is
reduced. When the door is in the opened position, it is
within the turning radius of the turning table.An object of the present invention mace in view of the
above-described problem is to prevent deviation of the door
from its turning radius when the door is opened while
reserving a size of the door opening and provide an
operation room of a vehicle having an upper turning body
which is capable of providing a large indoor space, thereby
eliminating defects of the related background art.Therefore, the present invention specifies a
construction machine comprising a turning table, a working equipment and
an operation cabin.
wherein an outer side of said operation cabin is located at an opposite side
to a boom of said working equipment installed on said turning table of said
construction machine and is formed into an outwardly curved arc including
door, said door formed into the outwardly curved arc is provided to be
freely slidable and is controlled to be within the turning radius of said
turning table along said outer side of said operation cabin when the
door is in the opened position; and
wherein a plurality of rails are provided on said outer side of said
operation cabin (2) and a plurality of rollers (7,8,9) are provided on the inner
side of said door which are
