<ABSTRACT>
An image evaluation circuit is connected to an 
image compression circuit and an image extension 

circuit. In the image evaluation circuit, original 
image data and extended image data reproduced from 

compressed image data are compared in each block pixel 
by pixel to generate block noise. The comparison is 

carried out twice to provide two block noises by two 
compression factors, and an optimum compression factor 

is determined in accordance with the two compression 
factors and the two block noises.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and an 
apparatus for compressing and extending an image, and 
more particularly to a method and an apparatus for 
evaluating an image by comparing an original image and 
an extended image. In a conventional facsimile or television-telephone 
set, transmission data is compressed and 
encoded so that the data transmission amount is 
decreased. As a method for compressing image data, 
an estimate encoding method and a transformation 
encoding method are utilized conventionally. In the 
estimate encoding method, a signal to be next supplied 
is estimated in accordance with a signal which has been 
known by decoding an encoded signal, so that only a 
signal component which is different in the estimation 
from a correct signal is transmitted to decrease the 
amount of information to be encoded. In the transformation encoding method, only 
coefficients of components, signal electric power of 
which converges on a low frequency region, are encoded  
 
to decrease the amount of information, because the 
signal electric power of image signals having high 
correlation is distributed mainly on the low frequency 
region. That is, the correlation of the image 
signals is positively utilized, so that higher 
compression effect is obtained in the transformation 
encoding method than in the estimation encoding method. 
However, the amount of arithmetic logic processes is 
larger in the transformation encoding method than in 
the estimation encoding method, so that the practical 
use of the transformation encoding method has been 
delayed as compared to the estimation encoding method. In accordance with the development of computer 
technology, however, the calculation of orthogonal 
transformation required for the transformation encoding 
method has been easy in these days, so that the 
transformation encoding method has been widely used in 
the encoding of images. As an orthogonal 
transformation to a frequency region, DCT (discrete 
cosine transformation) is considered to be most 
effective for practical uses, because DCT is superior 
in regard to electric power converging on a low 
frequency region and the process speed of calculation 
algorithm. Among other orthogonal transformations 
than DCT, slant transformation, hurl transformation, 
etc. can be used in encoding images. According to the conventional image compression  
 
method using DCT, however, there is a disadvantage in that 
an optimum compression factor is difficult to be set 
therein. That is, when coefficients are
