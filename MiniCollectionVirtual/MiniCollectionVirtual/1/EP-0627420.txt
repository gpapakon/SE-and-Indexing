<ABSTRACT>
A stabilized maleimide compound which is hardly discolored during storage, wherein the content of primary amines is 500 
ppm or less, that of maleic anhydride is 5-2,000 ppm, and that of 2-amino-N-substituted succinimide is 300 ppm or less. It is preferable 

that the content of chlorine compounds be 10 ppm or less in terms of chlorine and that of volatile components having each 
a boiling point of 200 °C or below under an ordinary pressure be 2,000 ppm or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a maleimide compound with improved storage stability which is hard to discolor. More particularly, it relates to a maleimide compound useful as a raw material for producing a heat resistant polymer such as AS resin, ABS resin and the like.A maleimide compound is solid or liquid at room temperature, so it is stored in various forms. For example, a solid maleimide is handled in the form of tablets, flakes, powders, etc. at room temperature and the forms thereof during storage such as flake container bags, drum containers, gallon containers, paper bags, tank containers are varied. Maleimide compound in heated molten state is stored in storage tanks in a liquid state.There has been a problem that the color of the maleimide compound is changed gradually to a blown color, and sometimes into a slightly bluish black brown color, when it is stored in such a solid or liquid state. The rate of discoloration of the maleimide compound varies depending on state, form and storage conditions of the stored maleimide compound, and the discoloration of the maleimide compound during its storage is inevitable although it can occur quickly or slowly.Discoloration of the maleimide compound is an important problem when used. That is, since the maleimide compound itself is a kind of raw monomer used for improving heat resistance of various thermoplastic resins such as styrene type resins, e.g., AS resin and ABS resin, methyl methacrylate resins, and vinyl chloride resins, etc., the discoloration of the maleimide compound makes the various thermoplastic resins discolored, and as a natural result, the commercial value of the thermoplastic resins decreases considerably. Thus it is necessary to solve the discoloration problem just mentioned above.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a stabilized maleimide compound which is hard to discolor during its storage.The above object can be attained by a maleimide compound with improved storage stability wherein the content of primary amines is not more than 500 ppm.The above object can also be attained by a maleimide compound with improved storage stability wherein the content of primary amines is not more than 500 ppm and the content of maleic anhydride is in the range of 5 to 2,000 ppm.The above object can further be attained by a maleimide compound with improved storage stability wherein the content of primary amines is not more than 500 ppm and the content of 2-amino-N-substituted succinimide compounds is not more than 300

<CLAIMS>
A process for suppressing discoloration of a maleimide compound 
characterised in that
 the process comprises: limiting the content of primary amines to not more than 500 ppm by continuously washing the maleimide compound with water; limiting the content of chlorine compounds reduced as a chlorine atom to not more than 10 ppm by using compounds containing no chlorine compounds as raw materials; limiting the content of volatile compounds having a boiling point of not more than 200°C at normal pressure to not more than 2000 ppm by ventilating the maleimide compound with inert gas; and limiting the content of 2-amino-N-substituted succinimide compounds to not more than 300 ppm by reacting maleic anhydride and primary amine in a molar ratio of not less than 1.
