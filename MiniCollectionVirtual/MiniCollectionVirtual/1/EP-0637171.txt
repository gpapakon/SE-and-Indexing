<ABSTRACT>
A receiver has a controller 4 which comprises 
a change-over portion 110 for effecting by a manual 

switching action on a remote-control command 2 a changeover 
between a mode 1 wherein teletext is presented on 

a display unit 19 and a mode 2 wherein the display unit 
resumes the television broadcast or shows various 

functions of the teletext other than those of the mode 1, 
a setting portion 111 for setting each of color keys 25 

on the command 2, i.e., RED key 21, GREEN key 22, YELLOW 
key 23 and CYAN key 24, for a specified function corresponding 

to the changed-over mode and indicating the 
function of the set color key 25 on the display unit 19 

in characters of the same color as the color key 25, and 
an execution portion 112 for realizing the set function 

when the color key 25 is depressed. Each of the color 
keys 25 has a contents display selecting function or page 

function in the mode 1, or the set specified function 
other than those of mode 1 in the mode 2, thus 

performing different functions in the mode 1 and mode 2 
to reduce the number of keys on the panel of the command 

2. A particular key function on the display unit 19 can 
be executed by depressing the color key 25 of the same 

color as the color characters indicating the function on 
the display unit, hence facilitated manipulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system 
for selecting character information programs for use 
in television receivers having a teletext function. The teletext broadcast is a character 
broadcast which is practiced mainly in Western Europe. 
First briefly stated, the teletext broadcast transmits 
together with conventional television signals a series 
of character information programs which are repeated 
cyclically as shown in FIG. 10, (A). From among these 
character information programs, the desired program is 
selected by the viewer and presented on the display 
to provide the required character information. The program usually comprises a plurality of 
pages each of which is displayed as a unit on one 
screen as shown in FIG. 10, (B). Outside the vertical 
synchronization period within the vertical retrace  
 
period of video signals for two fields, the information 
of each page is transmitted as dispersed in data blocks 
termed data packets as shown in FIG. 10, (C) and (D). 
The data packets contain, besides page information, 
various items of control data, for example, for the 
FLOF service to be described below (reference: "SPB 
492 TELETEXT SPECIFICATION," European Broadcasting 
Union, published December 1992). With conventional television receivers 
(TV sets) having the teletext function, there are two 
kinds of modes for specifying a particular page 
presenting the desired character information program; 
one is a contents display selecting function which is 
termed FULL-LEVEL-ONE FEATURE (FLOF) or TOP mode, and 
the other is a mode wherein the number of desired page is 
directly input (direct input mode). Hereafter, FLOF mode is referred to among the 
above-mentioned two modes as the contents display 
selecting function unless otherwise noticed. The contents display selection function is a 
service offered by the broadcasting station for 
facilitated page selection. When this service is 
available, the display 19 of the receiver shows, as seen 
in FIG. 18, a title page 100 as [P105], and the field of 
teletext broadcast programs [SPORT][AAA][BBB][CCC] in  
 
color characters of red, green, yellow and cyan. In the following description, the characters 
on the panel of a remote-control command 2 and the 
characters on the display screen will be expressed as 
enclosed in brackets [ ]. As shown in FIG. 17, on the other hand, the 
operating remote controller (remote-control command) has 
arranged thereon a red key [R] 21, green key [G] 22, 
yellow key [Y] 23 and cyan key [C] 24 which are color 
ke

<CLAIMS>
In a television receiver having a teletext 
function comprising a video signal processor 14 for 

converting to predetermined signals a video signal 
in a received signal of a television broadcast containing 

a teletext signal, a teletext processor 3 for 
separating the teletext signal from the received signal 

and outputting information as to a specified page, a 
change-over unit 15 for effecting a change-over between 

the outputs from the video signal processor 14 and the 
tele
text processor 3 or superimposing the outputs, a 
display unit 19 for displaying a video signal output 

from the change-over unit 15, and operating means 29 
comprising a remote-control command 2 and a remote-control 

detector 11 in the receiver 1 for giving a 
setting input for a screen display, the operating means 

29 further having color keys 25 including setting keys 
21, 22, 23, 24 which are different from one another in 

color to execute a contents display selecting function 
service and show the function of each of the color keys 

25 on the display unit 19, a system for selecting 
character information programs characterized in that 

the receiver comprises a controller 4 having change-over 
means 110 for effecting by a manual switching 

action on the remote-control command 2 a change-over 
 

between a mode 1 wherein teletext is shown on the display 
unit 19 and a mode 2 wherein the display unit 19 resumes 

the TV broadcast or shows various functions of the teletext 
other than the mode 1, setting means 111 for setting each 

of the color keys 25 for a specified function corresponding 
to the changed-over mode and indicating the function of the 

set color key 25 on the display unit 19 in characters of 
the same color as the color key, and execution means 112 

for realizing the set function when the color key 25 is 
depressed, each of the color keys 25 having a contents 

display selecting function or page function in the mode 1, 
and the set specified function other than the said function 

of mode 1 in the mode 2. 
A system as defined in claim 1 wherein the 
controller 4 of the receiver 1 comprises detecting 

means 6 for detecting presence or absence of a contents 
display selecting function signal in the broadcast 

signal, setting means 7 for automatically changing over 
the function of each of the color keys 25 of the 

operating means 29 in accordance with the result of 
detection by the detecting means 6 and indicating the 

changed-over function in characters of the same color 
as the color key on the display unit 19, and execution 

means 8 for performing the function of the color key 25 
set by the setting means 7 upon a setting action on 

 
the operating means 29, the setting means 7 being 

operable, upon the detecting means 6 recognizing that 
no contents display selecting function service is 

available, to give the setting key 21 among the setting 
keys 21 to 24 serving as the color keys 25 a function 

of showing a page one page before the current page, give 
another one of the setting keys, 22, a function of showing 

a page one page ahead of the current page, give 
the other setting keys 23, 24 a function of showing 

pages respectively different larger numbers of pages 
ahead of the current page, and indicate on the display 

unit 19 the pages to be shown.
