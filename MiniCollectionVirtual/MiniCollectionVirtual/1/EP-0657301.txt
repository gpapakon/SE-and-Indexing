<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal transfer printing, and more 
particularly to dyes used in a thermal dye transfer printing construction. Specifically, the 
present invention relates to a series of fluorine-containing, i.e., fluorine- or trifluoromethyl-containing, 
arylazoaniline dyes capable of providing yellow-orange colorfast images and 
excellent light stability in a thermal transfer printing process. In thermal transfer printing, an image is formed on a receptor sheet by 
selectively transferring a dye from a dye donor sheet to a receptor sheet, typically having 
coated thereon an image receiving layer. The term "thermal transfer" is used herein in a broad 
sense and includes any printing process by which dye (alone or in association with carrier 
materials such as solvents, binders, etc.) is transferred from one layer to another layer or sheet 
upon an application of thermal energy. Typically, material to be transferred from the dye 
donor sheet is directed by a thermal printhead, which consists of small electrically heated 
elements (print heads). These elements transfer image-forming material from the dye donor 
sheet to areas of the dye receptor sheet in an image-wise manner. Thermal transfer printing processes are well known in the art and include 
such systems as thermal dye transfer, sublimation dye transfer, and thermal mass transfer. 
Other systems included within the broad terminology used herein include direct transfer, 
strippable transfer, peel apart, and the like. In each of these systems, the dye is typically 
contained within a polymeric or resinous binder thereby forming a dye donor layer on the 
donor sheet. Typically, the dye is present in the binder in an amount of at least about 2%, 
depending upon the degree of its transfer and its covering power in the transferred state. The 
receptor sheet typically has a polymeric or resinous material coated thereon to form an image 
receiving layer for receipt of the dye. In a mass transfer system the dye is transferred with 
the binder. Thus, in such systems, the receptor sheet may not need an additional image 
receiving layer. Thermal transfer dyes typically should meet several performance criteria for 
practical applications. They should be able to transfer from the donor to the receptor upon 
application of thermal energy. For systems other than mass transfer systems, in which the 
entire quantity of dye transfers, the dyes should ideally demonstrate grey levels, i.e., grey 
scales. That is, the dyes should be able to transfer
