<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for removal of the core from an item of produce and to separate the edible portion therefrom comprises a lower conveyor (11) including a succession of longitudinally spaced apart produce support means (17); an upper conveyor (12) including a succession of longitudinally spaced apart produce cutter assemblies (18), the produce support means (17) and produce cutter assemblies (18) being spaced apart to an equivalent extent; a cam track (24, 25) associated with the upper conveyor and comprising laterally-distanced parallel rails; each cutter assembly comprising cutter elements formed as cooperating pivotally-connected half cylinders (28) including lower cutter lobes (30) having confronting oblique cutting edges (31) which close together in a cutting movement as the half-cylinders pivot away from each other, the half-cylinders including upwardly-extending operating arms (32) which engage the cam rails (24, 25) on the outsides or insides thereof to effect the cutting movement, the apparatus including a produce loading station (13), a produce cutting station (14) and removal stations for core (16) and edible portions (15) respectively, the produce support means (17) and cutter assemblies (18) being arranged to pass in registration through the cutting station (14) and the cam rails (24, 25) being adapted to close the cutting edges (31) as the cutter assemblies and produce support means pass through the cutting station.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the automated removal of the core from 
items of produce, in particular from cauliflowers or calabrese, to enable the edible 
portions thereof to be collected. For convenience throughout this specification, 
a distinction is drawn between the core and the edible portions of produce; in 
practice, the entire produce is edible, the core typically being used in the 
preparation of pickles and the like. The term "edible portions" should be taken 
to mean those parts which are suitable to be eaten as they are, optionally 
following cooking, and the term "core" should be taken to mean those parts 
which, although edible, require farther and separate processing. Apparatus for automated removal of the cores from items of produce and having 
the features set forth in the preamble of claim 1 herein is known from GB-A-2213045. European patent application no. EP-A 0352077 also describes apparatus for core 
removal, in which the item of produce is supported in an apertured tray with the 
core oriented downwardly and exposed to a cutter blade through the aperture, 
such that the blade cuts away the core and closes the aperture, thus allowing the 
core to drop away under gravity while retaining the edible portion in the tray. 
One problem with such apparatus, however, is that it is not always possible to 
support the produce sufficiently firmly that the cutter blade does not dislodge it. 
It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide core removal 
apparatus which does not suffer from this disadvantage. According to the present invention, apparatus for removal of the core from an 
item of produce and for separation of the edible portion therefrom comprises a 
conveyor with produce-support means disposed thereon, cutter means, a produce 
loading station where produce to be cut is loaded onto said produce support  
 
means, a collection station for cores, a collection station for edible portions, and 
a cutting station between said produce loading station and said collection station, 
where said produce is cut by the cutter means to remove said cores from said 
edible portions, characterised in that 
said conveyor constitutes a lower conveyor and 
said apparatus further comprises an upper 
conveyor with the cutter means disposed thereon and is constructed such that said 
upper and lower conveyors are arranged in confronting spaced-apart relationship 
as the respective cutter means and produce support means pass in mutual 
registration through the cutting station.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the removal of the core from an item of produce and for 
separation of the edible portion therefrom, the apparatus comprising 


a conveyor (11), 
produce support means (17) disposed on said conveyor, 
cutter means (18), 
a produce loading station (13) where produce to be cut is loaded 
onto said produce support means, 
a collection station for cores (16), 
a collection station for edible portions (15), and 
a cutting station (14) between said produce loading station and said 
collection station where said produce is cut by the cutter means to 

remove said cores from said edible portions, 
characterised in that
 said conveyor constitutes a lower conveyor and said 
apparatus further comprises an upper conveyor (12) with the cutter means (18) 

disposed thereon and is constructed such that said upper and lower conveyors are 
arranged in confronting spaced-apart relationship as the respective cutter means 

(18) and produce support means (17) pass in mutual registration through the 
cutting station (14). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein the cutter means comprise 
cooperating semi-circular cutting blades (28). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, wherein the cutter means comprise half-cylinders 
(28) which are pivotably linked together by side bracket members (29), 

the lower ends of said half-cylinders forming cutter lobes (30) with oblique cutting 
edges (31). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the apparatus includes  
 

a longitudinally-mounted cam track (24, 25) and the cutter means include 
actuating arms (32) which cooperatively engage the cam track, whereby lateral 

displacements in the run of the cam track cause the cutter means to perform a 
cutting or a return movement. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, wherein in the cutting station (14) the upper 
conveyor has a portion which converges towards the lower conveyor whereby 

produce to be cut is positioned between the cutter means before the cutting edges 
close together in a cutting movement. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein at least one of the 
conveyors (11, 12) is height adjustable. 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, wherein the lower conveyor (11) is height 
adjustable and is pivotable about a lateral axis at one end thereof, the other end 

being raisable and lowerable by means of a snail cam (39). 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the conveyors include 
tensioning devices. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein the produce support 
means (17) have an internal conical concave profile. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, the apparatus comprising a 
lower conveyor (11) including a succession of longitudinally spaced apart produce 

support means (17), an upper conveyor (12) including a succession of 
longitudinally spaced apart produce cutter assemblies (18), the produce support 

means and produce cutter assemblies being spaced apart to an equivalent extent; 
a cam track (24, 25) associated with the upper conveyor and comprising laterally-distanced 

parallel rails; each cutter assembly comprising cutter elements formed  
 

as cooperating pivotally-connected half cylinders (28) including lower cutter lobes 
(30) having confronting oblique cutting edges (31) which close together in a 

cutting movement as the half-cylinders pivot away from each other, the half-cylinders 
including upwardly-extending operating arms (32) which engage the cam 

rails on the outsides or insides thereof to effect the cutting movement, the 
apparatus including a produce loading station (13), a produce cutting station (14) 

and removal stations for core (16) and edible portions (15) respectively, the 
produce support means and the cutter assemblies being arranged to pass in 

registration through the cutting station and the cam rails being adapted to close 
said cutting edges as the cutter assemblies and produce support means pass 

through the cutting station. 
A method of removing cores from items of produce using the apparatus as 
claimed in Claim 1, the method comprising supporting each item on a produce 

support means (17) disposed on a lower conveyor (11) and advancing the 
conveyor in registration with cutter means (18) disposed on an upper conveyor 

(12) through a cutting station (14) in which the cutter means operates to separate 

the cores from the edible portions of the produce, and removing the cores and the 
edible portions at respective removal stations (16, 15) downstream of the cutting 

station.
