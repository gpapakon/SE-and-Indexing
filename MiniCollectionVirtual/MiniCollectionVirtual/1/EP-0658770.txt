<ABSTRACT>
A method is proposed by means of which openings or cutouts (16, 17) which are used for the purpose of leading conductor tracks out of the oscillation chamber (5) of an accelerometer (1) in a manner preventing short circuits can be sealed in a gas-tight fashion in a simple way. The conductor tracks represent the conductive connection between terminal contacts (13, 14, 15), accessible from outside, of the accelerometer (1) having electrodes (11, 12), which are assigned on both sides to the oscillating mass (7), likewise constructed as an electrode, of the accelerometer (1). The method proposes to use an adhesive which can be cured by means of light, in particular UV light. A defined quantity of the adhesive is applied at a specific point (23) of the accelerometer (1), and after an experimentally determined residence time, after which the adhesive has also penetrated into the cutouts (16, 17) due to capillary effects and has sealed said cutouts, is cured by being exposed. The sealing is performed in an N2 atmosphere. The oscillating chamber (5) is evacuated in advance.

Method for sealing openings (16, 17) caused by the 
production process in micromechanical acceleration sensors 

(1) produced as differential capacitors in the form of a 
glass-silicon-glass layered package, the oscillating mass 

(7) of a flexural resonator (6) structured out of the 
electroconductively doped silicon layer (4) being assigned, 

on the inner surfaces of the glass layers (2, 3), counter-electrodes 
(11, 12) which are electroconductively 

connected, by means of strip conductors attached with the 
same area, to terminal contacts (13, 14) formed outside the 

oscillation space (5), there being formed in the silicon 
layer (4) surrounding the oscillation space (5) openings 

(16, 17) or relatively shallow recesses which serve for 
leading the strip conductors out of the oscillation space 

(5) in a short-circuit-proof manner,
 
characterised 


in that a light-curable adhesive is used to seal the 
recesses (16, 17), 
in that a defined quantity (22) of the adhesive is applied 
to a specific point of the acceleration sensor (1), with 

utilisation of adhesive migration caused by capillary 
forces, and 
in that the adhesive is cured by exposure to light after an 
experimentally determined spreading time. 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised 


in that the sealing is carried out in a protective-gas 
atmosphere, and 
in that the oscillation space (5) of the acceleration 
sensor (1) is evacuated prior to the sealing.
