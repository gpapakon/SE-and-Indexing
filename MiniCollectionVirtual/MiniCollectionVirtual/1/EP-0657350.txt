<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the invention makes use of a drive member (7) mounted so as to rotate around a fixed shaft (6) and driven in rotation by virtue of a servo motor (32) controlled by a computer for automatic control of the speed of the aeroplane, two throttles (1, 2) integral respectively with two annular elements (4, 5) mounted so as to rotate about the said shaft, on either side of the drive member (7), two electromagnetic couplers arranged respectively between the said annular element (4, 5) and the said drive member (7), and two angular position sensors (23, 24) associated respectively with two annular elements, these two sensors being connected respectively to the fuel control circuits of the aeroplane engine. This system makes it possible to guarantee independence of the two throttles (1, 2) as well as the required safety level for automatic control of the aeroplane.

A throttle control device controlling two 
engines of a same aerodyne, said device using a drive 

mechanism (7) mounted rotatably about a fixed axis (6) 
and rotated by means of a servomotor (32) controlled by 

a computer (41) ensuring automatic flight velocity 
control for the aircraft, two levers (1, 2) 

respectively integral with two annular elements (4, 5) 
mounted rotatably about said axis, on both sides of the 

drive mechanism and coupled therewith by means of a 
disengageable coupler, and two angular position sensors 

(23, 24) respectively associated with said two annular 
elements, these two sensors (23, 24) being respectively 

connected to the throttle control circuit of said 
aircraft.
 
characterized in that the drive mechanism comprises two 

coaxial cylindrical sleeves (8, 9) integral with one 
another in their middle part by way of an annular strut 

(10), the sleeve of smallest diameter (9) serving as a 
bearing for the rotary mounting of the drive mechanism 

(7) about said axis (6) while the sleeve of largest 
diameter (8) comprises a means (29) for rotating from 

the servomotor (32),
 
in that the annular elements (4, 5) each comprise an 

annular portion extending axially into one of the 
annular cavities formed between the two cylindrical 

sleeves (8, 9) on either side of the strut (10),
 
and in that said annular portion comprises an 

electromagnet capable of exerting traction on an 
armature (16) designed to act upon coaxial clutch disks 

(18, 20) respectively interdependent in rotation with 
the annular portion and with at least one of said 

cylindrical sleeves (8, 9), but axially mobile in 
relation to the latter, said electromagnet, said  

 
armature (16) and said disks (19, 20) forming a 

coupler. 
The device as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that it further comprises a lever (34) 

mounted on a cylindrical socket (35) mounted rotatably 
coaxially with the axis (6),
 
in that on the threaded outer surface of this socket 

(35) is screwed a nut (36) that is axially mobile 
though fixedly prevented from rotating,
 
and in that this nut axially rests against the mobile 

assembly comprising the annular elements and the drive 
mechanism (7) by means of springs so as to exert an 

adjustable friction torque on said mobile assembly. 
The device as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the servomotor (32) is controlled 

by a loop control circuit using: 

a first subtracter (40) which receives a control 
signal (Î´x) from a computer (41) ensuring automatic 

flight velocity control for the aircraft and a signal 
representing the initial position of the levers and 

which is provided by a memory (42) coupled to the 
sensors (23, 24), 
a second subtracter (43) which receives, on the one 
hand, a signal coming from said sensors (23, 24) and 

representing the angular position of the levers (1, 
2), and, on the other hand, a control signal from 

said subtracter (40) (this signal taking into account 
the initial position of said levers). 
The device as claimed in claim 3,
 
characterized in that it further comprises a monitoring 

device using: 

a circuit (45) simulating the control loop (43, 44, 
32, 23, 24) which issues information concerning the 

angular position of the levers,  
 
a comparator (46) which compares said angular 
position determined by the simulating circuit with 

the actual position of the sensors (23, 24), and 
two logic circuits (47, 48), each receiving data 
provided by the subtracter, these circuits each 

comprising a means (arrows 49, 50) enabling said 
levers (1, 2) to be disengaged when said comparator 

(46) detects an inconsistency between its two input 
signals. 
The device as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterized in that the electromagnetic couplers can 

be controlled directly by means of switches (I
1
, I
2
) 
provided on the two levers 1, 2).
