<ABSTRACT>
The cap can be push-fitted, for example, on a keg spear and has teeth 13 
which engage over an annular projection 50 on the spear. The teeth are 

designed to permit easy fitting, but difficult removal. Each tooth 13 is 
hinged at 41 to the cap skirt, so as to move pivotally to permit passage 

over projection, but is biased to a position resisting removal. Each tooth 
is pivotally in the reverse direction when an attempt is made to remove the 

cap, causing a tail member (45) associated with the tooth to engage a stop 
(39) and serve as a resistive support for the tooth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a push-fittable cap, for example for fitting onto 
a keg spear as a deterrent to pilfering. A keg spear has an annular projection over which a cap can be push-fitted 
by means of resilient teeth to secure the cap to the spear. A cap of this 
type is known, for example, from GB-A-2082151. The cap has a plastics 
skirt with an inner ring of teeth, which snap engage over the annular 
projection of a keg spear. The cap of the present invention is usable for any purpose where it is 
desired to snap engage a cap over a projection, so that removal of the cap 
is resisted. In GB-A-2082151, the teeth project inwardly from the skirt at an acute 
angle towards the top of the cap. The teeth are thickest at the junction 
with the skirt and taper towards their free ends. The teeth are caused, 
during snap-engagement, to bend near their free ends. If the cap is composed of a brittle material, the teeth may break during 
engagement. If, on the other hand, the material is resilient, the teeth may 
still be deformed and the cap may be easily removable due to the 
resilience. This problem is exacerbated where large tolerances are 
required. This is the case with keg spears, since the annular projections, 
over which the teeth engage, are of varying profiles. It is clearly of great 
benefit, if each cap does not have to be made specifically for a keg spear 
with one profile. The present invention provides a cap, which can be push-fitted into  
 
engagement with a keg spear, or other article with an annular projection, 
without damage to the teeth and with substantial resistance to removal of 
the cap. GB-A-2082151 provides a cap for a keg spear, the cap having a top and 
a skirt provided with a ring of inwardly projecting teeth, which can be 
passed over an annular projection on a keg spear to resist removal of the 
cap, each tooth being delectable towards the cap top under a force towards 
the cap top, so as to permit the tooth to pass over the annular projection, 
the tooth being resiliently biased to said inwardly projecting position. The present invention is characterised in that each tooth is provided with 
a tail member the tooth and tail member combination being joined to the 
skirt by a hing portion, the skirt having a stop engageable by the tail 
member under a force on the tooth in a direction away from the cap top, 
so as to resist pivotal movement of the tooth in that direction. The hinged arrangement permits each tooth to pivot during fitting, so that 
the cap is easily pushed on to a

<CLAIMS>
A cap for a keg spear, the cap having a top (11) and a skirt (12) 
provided with a ring of inwardly projecting teeth (13), which can 

be passed over an annular projection (50) on a keg spear to resist 
removal of the cap, each tooth being deflectable towards the cap 

top under a force towards the cap top, so as to permit the tooth to 
pass over the annular projection (50), the tooth being resiliently 

biased to said inwardly projecting position, characterised in that 
each tooth (13) is provided with a tail member (45) the tooth and 

tail member combination being joined to the skirt (12) by a hinge 
portion (41), the skirt (12) having a stop (39) engageable by the tail 

member (45) under a force on the tooth in a direction away from 
the cap top, so as to resist pivotal movement of the tooth in that 

direction. 
A cap according to claim 1, wherein the skirt (12) has an outwardly 
extending flange (15) adjacent the hinged portions (41) and defining 

a ring between a main portion of the skirt and the end of the skirt 
remote from the cap, the inner periphery of the ring defining a stop 

for each of said tail members (45). 
A cap according to Claim 1 or 2, where each tooth (13) is formed 
in one piece with the respective tail member (45) and hinge portion 

(41) and with the skirt (12), the hinge portion comprising a 
projection located between each tooth and the skirt. 
A cap according to Claim 3 in the form of a one-piece injection 
moulding. 
A cap according to any preceding claim, wherein the skirt has weak 
 

portions (21), which indicate tamper evidence, if broken when an 
attempt is made to remove the cap. 
A cap according to any preceding claim, including a tab (30) 
connected with the remainder of the cap by frangible portions (32), 

whereby pulling on the tab splits the cap to facilitate removal.
