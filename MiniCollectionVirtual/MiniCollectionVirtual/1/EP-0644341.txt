<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to motion 
transmitting remote control cable assemblies of the type 
for transmitting motion in a curved path, and more 
particularly to a system for translating rotational 
motion from one wheel to a second wheel by means of an 
core element entrained around both wheels in a closed 
all-tension system. Remote control actuators enable an operator to 
control a valve from a remote control station. A remote 
control assembly of the type according to the preamble of claim 1 and disclosed in 
US-A-4 509 387 to Tschanz et al., of common 
assignee herewith, is frequently used in ships for such 
a purpose. The Tschanz remote control includes a geared 
drive wheel, a geared driven wheel and an endless core 
element entrained around the drive and driven wheels to 
translate motion from the drive wheel to the driven 
wheel in a closed all-tension system. The core element 
includes a plurality of spaced apart radial protrusions 
which engage the gears on both wheels and thus enable 
rotational motion to be translated between the two 
wheels by means of the core element. The core element  
 
in this system is made endless by joining the two ends 
of a length of the core element with some kind of 
connector - usually a rigid joining tube crimped around 
the ends of the core element. The joining tube on the 
core element usually travels back and forth between the 
wheels. A problem occurs with such a system whenever 
the core element moves relative to the wheels to such an 
extent that the joining tube contacts the gear teeth on 
one of the wheels. Since the joining tube is rigid, it 
cannot negotiate the radii established by the wheels and 
thus tends to damage the gears when contacting them, or 
jam between the gears and a housing which encloses the 
wheel. This locks any further movement of the core 
element and the wheels. If the joining tube is jammed 
between the geared wheel and the housing, the joining 
tube itself can be damaged, possibly allowing the ends 
of the core element to become detached. Cardan type connectors such as disclosed in FR-A-413 530 and 
US-A-2 957 353 to Babacz, of common assignee 
herewith, have two mutually perpendicular pivot axes about which the 
core element ends can pivot.  
 A motion transmitting remote control cable 
assembly for transmitting motion in a curved path 
comprises a drive wheel housing for enclosing a geared 
drive wheel having a plurality of gear teeth and a 
driven wheel housing spaced apart from said drive wheel 
housing for enclosing
