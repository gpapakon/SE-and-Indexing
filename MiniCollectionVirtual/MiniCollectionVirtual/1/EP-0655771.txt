<ABSTRACT>
A quadrupole mass analyzer has a pair of heat sink plates (16, 17) and springs 
(18) that clamp ceramic holders (13, 14) that hold four rod electrodes (12) of a 

quadrupole unit of the analyzer. Heat generated dielectrically in the ceramic holders 
(13, 14) by a high frequency alternating electromagnetic field caused by an AC 

voltage applied to the four rod electrodes (12) is promptly transferred to the heat sink 
plates (16, 17), thereby preventing displacement of the four rod electrodes (12) or loss 

of symmetry thereof when a mass of ions is analyzed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to quadrupole mass analyzers and to quadrupole units 
thereof. Fig. 5 of the accompanying drawings shows a previously proposed quadrupole 
mass analyzer which includes a quadrupole unit 40, an ion detector 46 positioned at 
an exit of the quadrupole unit 40, and a driver circuit 50. The quadrupole unit 40 is 
composed of four rod electrodes 41, 42, 43, 44 positioned parallel to and 
symmetrically around a z axis. The driver circuit 50 applies both a direct current 
(DC) voltage U and a high frequency alternating current (AC) voltage V.cos(ω.t) 
simultaneously between a pair 42, 44 of the electrodes that are positioned along an 
x axis and the other pair of electrodes 41 and 43, which are positioned along the y 
axis. When ions are introduced into the centre of an end of the quadrupole unit 40 
while the DC/AC voltage is applied to the four rod electrodes 41, 42, 43, 44, only 
ions 45 having a specific mass can pass through the quadrupole unit 40: other ions 
47 disperse before reaching the ion detector 46. Since the specific mass of the ions 
that can pass through the quadrupole unit 40 is determined by the DC voltage U and 
the high frequency AC voltage V, the mass of ions 45 detected by the ion detector 
46 can be scanned by changing the values of the voltages U and V with a certain 
correlation between them. The four rod electrodes 41, 42, 43, 44 of the quadrupole unit 40 must be 
positioned precisely symmetrically around the z axis to perform a correct mass 
analysis. Thus, it has been proposed that the four rod electrodes 41, 42, 43, 44 be 
securely held by a pair of ceramic holders 48 and 49 at respective ends of the rod 
electrodes 41, 42, 43, 44, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, to prevent displacement of the 
rod electrodes within the quadrupole unit 40. Then, the quadrupole unit 40 is 
inserted into a cylindrical case 52, as shown in Fig. 6, or placed on a base plate 53, 
as shown in Fig. 7, such that the unit 40 is correctly aligned with an ion entrance and 
with the ion detector 46 (not shown in Figs. 6 and 7). A quadrupole mass analyzer according to the first (pre-characterising) part of 
claim 1 is disclosed in US Patent No. US-A-4 032 782. When the high frequency AC voltage is applied to the four rod electrodes 41,  
 
42, 43, 44 as described above in order to perform a mass analysis, the ceramic 
holders 48 and 49 are subjected to a high frequency alternating electromagnetic field 
and heat is generated in the ceramic holders 48 and 49 due to the dielectric heating 
effec
