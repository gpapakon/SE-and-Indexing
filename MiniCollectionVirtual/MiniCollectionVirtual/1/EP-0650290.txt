<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for facsimile data encoding uses vectors indicating the 
locations of changing elements along a horizontal scan line. The change vectors are stored in 

a vector table. The system may use a reference vector table and a coding vector table if 
CCITT recommendation T.6 two dimensional encoding is used. The system encodes 

horizontal scan lines using the vectors to determine the location of the changing elements. 
The value of the reference changing element is easily determined using the vector tables. 

The system determines the locations of all changing elements on a horizontal scan line before 
performing any encoding of that particular scan line thus simplifying the encoding process. 

The system can receive and decode facsimile data to generate change vectors. The change 
vectors provide a simple mechanism for regenerating the raw data. The change vectors are 

used to encode raw data into any standard facsimile encoding format, to decode facsimile 
data, and to interconvert from one encoding format to another without having to convert the 

encoded data back to raw data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a system and method for encoding 
data, and more specifically, a system and method for encoding facsimile data. Facsimile (FAX) machines have long been used as a convenient system 
for transmitting data from one location to another. A transmitting FAX machine 
transmits a facsimile message over a telephone line to a receiving FAX machine. The 
telephone line may be a wire or optical cable, or may include a remote connection such 
as a microwave or satellite link. Thus, a user may send the facsimile message from one 
FAX machine to another FAX machine located anywhere in the world via the telephone 
line. The cost of sending a facsimile message long distance includes the 
transmission cost of the telephone call which is directly related to the length of the 
message being sent and the time at which the facsimile telephone call is placed. To 
reduce costs, the user may send the facsimile message during low-cost periods, such as 
at night, when the demand for telephone lines is minimal. Thus, the phone rate is 
decreased and the cost of sending the facsimile message is correspondingly decreased. The cost can also be reduced by minimizing the duration of the facsimile 
telephone call. One such method for minimizing the duration is to compress the data 
prior to transmission. Early facsimile machines used a basic data encoding technique, 
known as Modified Huffman (MH) encoding. This form of encoding permits 
compression of the facsimile message, with a corresponding decrease in the duration of 
the facsimile telephone call. Other data encoding techniques were developed for newer 
facsimile machines, although newer facsimile machines continue to retain MH 
encoding capability to enable facsimile communication with machines of the older 
design. A Modified Read (MR) encoding permits two-dimensional data encoding, 
which permits a higher degree of data compression than MH encoding. Both MH and 
MR encodings are described in standards established by the International Telegraph and 
Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) and published as Terminal Equipment and 
Protocols for Telematic Services (1989). The MH and MR data encodings are 
described in recommendation T.4 of the CCITT standard.  A third type of data compression is the Modified Modified Read (MMR 
encoding), which is described in recommendation T.6 of the CCITT standard and 
permits two-dimensional encoding of low- or high-resolution facsimile messages. The techniques used for encoding a facsimile message using
