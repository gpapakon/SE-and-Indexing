<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soft ocular lens
material. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a soft ocular lens material useful for contact
lenses, intraocular lenses or artificial cornea.Various ocular lens materials have been proposed as
contact lens materials or intraocular lens materials.
Such ocular lens materials are generally classified into
soft materials and hard materials. It is generally well
known that soft materials are preferred as materials for
contact lenses giving comfortable feeling to wearers, or
as materials for intraocular lenses which can be readily
inserted in a deformed shape through a small incision of
the eye ball without damaging eye tissues.Soft materials are classified into water-absorptive
materials which swell and soften upon absorption of
water, and substantially non-water absorptive materials.The water absorptive materials have a drawback that
they are inferior in the mechanical strength since upon
absorption of water, the proportion of the material 
itself is relatively small. Further, upon absorption of
water, bacteria or fungi are likely to propagate in the
materials. Therefore, when they are used as contact
lenses, it will be required to periodically repeat a
rather cumbersome operation such as boiling for
sterilization.As the substantially non-water absorptive materials,
a silicone rubber material and a (meth)acrylate soft
material may, for example, be mentioned.The silicone rubber material has a merit that it has
very high oxygen permeability. However, the surface of
the obtained material has extremely strong water
repellency and exhibits poor affinity to the cornea or
other ocular tissues. It has been reported that some of
the products prepared by using this material as a
material for contact lenses, have induced serious
troubles to the ocular tissues.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No.
102914/1984 and No. 297411/1988 propose as a contact lens
material a polymer composed of a cross-linked polymer
product of a polysiloxane macromonomer having
polymerizable groups bonded via e.g. urethane bonds to a
polysiloxane, with a hydrophilic monomer. Such a
material has strength improved to some extent, but when
the amount of the polysiloxane is small, it is difficult
to obtain a product having adequate oxygen permeability,
and if it is attempted to use a polysiloxane having a 
longer siloxane chain to increase the oxygen
permeability, the compatibility with other copolymer
components tends to be poor, and it becomes difficult to
obtain a material
