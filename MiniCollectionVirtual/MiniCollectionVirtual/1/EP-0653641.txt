<ABSTRACT>
An acceleration sensor 1 comprises a circuit board 3 on 
which an acceleration detecting element 2 is carried. A 

plurality of connecting terminals 4 arranged along the 
periphery of the circuit board 3 are
 projected outward after 
penetrating through a metal base plate 5. The metal base 

plate 5 is fixed to the connecting terminals 4 spaced apart 
from the circuit board 3 by a predetermined distance in a 

state being insulated from the connecting terminals 4. The 
peripheral edge of the metal base plate 5 is connected to a 

case 7 covering the entire acceleration sensor 1. Circuit 
elements constituting a signal processing circuit for processing 

a detection signal of the acceleration detecting 
element 2 are arranged on the upper surface and the lower 

surface of the circuit board 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the construction of an 
acceleration sensor mainly employed in an air bag system for 
an automobile. One example of a conventional acceleration sensor is 
illustrated in Fig. 1. A similar device is disclosed in EP-A-0550037. A conventional acceleration sensor 
50 comprises an acceleration detecting element 51, a circuit 
board 52, a plurality of connecting terminals 53, a metal 
base plate 54, a metal cap 55, and insulating projections 
56. The acceleration detecting element 51 is an element for 
detecting acceleration, converting the acceleration into an 
electric signal and outputting the electric signal and is 
carried on the circuit board 52. A signal processing 
circuit for processing an acceleration signal detected by 
the acceleration detecting element 51 is carried on the 
circuit board 52. An output of the signal processing 
circuit carried on the circuit board 52 is outputted outward 
from the acceleration sensor 50 through the plurality of 
connecting terminals 53. The circuit board 52 is bonded and 
fixed to the surface of the metal base plate 54. Each of 
the plurality of connecting terminals 53 has its end fixed  
 
to the circuit board 52 and the other end projected from the 
reverse surface of the metal base plate 54 after penetrating 
through the metal base plate 54. The metal cap 55 is fixed 
to a peripheral edge of the metal base plate 54 to cover the 
entire acceleration sensor 50. The connecting terminal 53 
is insulated from the metal base plate 54 and is fixed to 
the metal base plate 54 in a portion, through which the 
connecting terminal 53 penetrates, of the metal base plate 
54. The acceleration sensor 50 is mounted on the surface of 
a mounting substrate 60 by inserting the plurality of 
connecting terminals 53 through mounting holes (not shown) 
of the mounting substrate 60 and connecting and fixing the 
connecting terminals 53 and a wiring pattern of the mounting 
substrate 60 to each other by soldering. The conventional acceleration sensor 50 is used for 
detecting the change in acceleration in the travel direction 
of an automobile when it is used in an air bag system for an 
automobile, for example. However, vibration from a road 
surface and various types of vibration from the engine and 
the like are transmitted to the acceleration sensor 50 
carried on the body of the automobile. Such vibration may, 
in some cases, causes harmful vibration in the mounting 
substrate 60 in the acceleration sensor 50. For example, if 
vibration in a
