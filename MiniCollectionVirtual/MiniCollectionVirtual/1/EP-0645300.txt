<ABSTRACT>
A bicycle comprises a wheel-supporting member (46 
or 404), a swing arm (42 or 44) mounted on the wheel-supporting 

member (46 or 404) to pivot about a pivot 
axis, and a wheel (50F or 50R) mounted on the swing arm 

(42 or 44) for rotation about a rotation axis spaced 
apart from, to the rear of and substantially below the 

pivot axis. The pivot axis is located relative to the 
rotation axis such that upward vertical displacements 

of the rotation axis relative to the pivot axis upon 
rotation of the swing arm (42 or 44) from a neutral 

position are accompanied by substantial rearward 
horizontal displacements of the rotation axis relative 

to the pivot axis. In the case of a rear wheel 
suspension, the drive chain passes over an idler 

sheave, which is mounted for rotation on the rear wheel 
support member generally below the pivot axis with its 

circumferential support surface for the chain located 
such that a tangent to it is proximate to the pivot 

axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
Some mountain bikes have energy-absorbing 
suspensions. In the case of the front wheel, the 
suspension commonly includes an axially or pivotally 
acting energy-absorbing assembly that enables the front 
fork to move relative to the headset. Various forms of 
trailing arm suspensions are used for the rear wheel. 
In a typical rear suspension, as shown in Fig. 2, a 
structure 12 resembling the rear triangle of a 
conventional bike is pivotally attached to a frame 
portion 14 at a pivot axis 16 and is coupled to a frame 
portion 18 by an energy-absorbing and damping assembly 
20. Fig. 3 illustrates diagrammatically a 
characteristic of presently known suspensions, 
regardless of type, and regardless of whether they are 
for the front or rear wheels. The geometry of typical 
suspensions is such that the displacement of the wheel 
(and its rotation axis) when the wheel goes over a bump 
is primarily vertical. This means that the speed at 
which energy is absorbed by the suspension is short. 
For example, if the suspension could be designed to 
permit an infinite displacement horizontally upon 
encountering a bump, the time for absorbing the 
displacement would also be infinite -- the wheel would 
never go over the bump. Increasing the time for energy 
absorption permits the capacity of the energy absorbing 
and damping components to be reduced, as a direct 
function of the time, and improves the efficiency of 
the suspension. The geometries of previously known 
bicycle suspensions is such that only small horizontal 
rearward displacements for any given vertical  
 
displacements can occur. Some suspensions produce 
forward horizontal displacements upon upward vertical 
displacements, which makes the time for response even 
shorter. Thus, the capacity of the energy-absorbing 
and damping components of previously known bicycle 
suspensions must be large to absorb and damp the energy 
rapidly. As shown schematically in Fig. 3, a suspension of 
the type shown in Fig. 2 permits the rear wheel 22 to 
be displaced upwardly through a distance Î”V when the 
bike traverses a bump. In most, if not all, rear 
suspensions of the type under consideration, the 
pulling distance of the chain 24 between the pedal 
crank sprocket 26 and the freewheel sprocket 28 changes 
from a length L1 to a length L2 (which may be either an 
increase or decrease, depending on the geometry) when 
the rotation axis 30 of the wheel displaces vertically. 
Thus, the suspension is coupled to the chain pull, in 
the sense that displacement of the
