<ABSTRACT>
This invention deals with a safe key distribution and 
authentication in a data communication network (e.g. wireless 

LAN type of network). 
The network includes a network manager to which are connected, 
via a LAN wired circuit, one or more base stations. 

Individual remote stations are, in turn, wirelessly 
connected to an installed base station. 
One essential function for achieving security in such a 
network, is a mechanism to reliably authenticate the exchanges 

of data between communicating parties. This involves 
the establishment of session keys, which keys need 

to be distributed safely to the network components. An 
original and safe method is provided with this invention 

for key distribution and authentication during network 
installation, said method including using the first installed 

base station for generating a network key and a 
backbone key, and then using said first installed base 

station for subsequent remote station or additional base 
station installations while avoiding communicating said 

network key.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention deals with key distribution and authentication
in a data communication network, and more
particularly with key authentication in a wireless LAN
type of network.Conventional data communication networks include a
host station or network manager providing network control
by being connected to a network including one or several
node stations, which, in turn concentrate and manage the
traffic provided from/to remote terminal stations. In
principle, several terminal stations are attached to each
node station, such as to provide a sub-network which can
be referred to as a cell.One such network to be more particularly considered
in this invention may be defined as a wireless Local Area
Network (LAN). Such a network to be disclosed in details
in the following description includes remote stations
connected to individual nodes or base stations, via radio
links with the base station(s), in turn, connected to a
host (or network) manager (herein also referred to as
wireless manager) via a wired LAN circuitry.But regardless of be the network architecture, the
data traffic must be protected as the system poses increasing
threats to the security of communications and
operations involving end-users and network components. This problem has already received particular attention
from the data communication industry sector. In fact,
security is a must, and customers always include this
feature in defining their requirements or network functional
characteristics. One may easily understand their
concern on the matter when bearing in mind that in such
networks the flow of data carries very sensitive proprietary
information relating to the customers company operation,
e. g., cash-flows, prices, correspondence within the
network, requests from their own customers, etc...One essential function for achieving security in such
a network is a mechanism to reliably authenticate the
exchange of messages between communicating parties. This
involves the establishment of a session key, which key
needs being distributed safely.One such system has been described by S.P. Miller,
B.C. Newman, J.I. Schiller and J.H. Saltzer, as the
"Kerberos Authentication and Authorization System" of the
M.I.T. Project Athena, Cambridge, Massachussets, December
1987. The proposed system requires using physical protection
and synchronization operations. This is however troublesome
and a heavy burden to carry when it addresses
private networks made for non-technical customers wishing
to minimize their own implications on the network buildup.
