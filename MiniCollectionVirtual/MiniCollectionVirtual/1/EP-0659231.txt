<ABSTRACT>
Device for fastening of a rockbolt (12) in a hole (11) in rock, provided with an expansion bushing (14) at the inner end. At the outer end of the rockbolt, a washer like pressure member (18) is arranged to press against the rock (19), with a nut (16). The rockbolt (12) is provided with a tube (23) extending over at least the greater part of its free length, and is provided to supply cementing grout to the inner end of the rock hole and expelling of air from the rock hole. The tube is preferably connected to transfer cementing grout through the annular passage created in the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for mounting rockbolts, more particularly a
device as stated in the introductory part of claim 1. Such a device is
known for example from US-A-4 655 644.When permanently safeguarding with rockbolts, e.g. in tunnels, corrosion
protection is required. To achieve this, the bolt may be completely moulded by
injecting cementing grout or by "cement grouting". The bolts are usually hot
galvanized or powder painted.It is desirable to combine the use of bolts utilized for making a work place safe,
without any requirement for corrosion protection, and the succeeding cementing to
increase the fastening and establish protection against corrosion.To achieve this, tube shaped bolts with an expansion bushing at the inner end have
been used. This solution to the problem allows later cementing, but is expensive
because the cost of tube bolts is approximately twice that of steel bolts. Additionally,
this solution is sensitive to incorrect grout consistency.It has been proposed to after treat steel rods with a cementing hose and a venting
tube. A steel rod is fastened at its inner end with an expansion bushing or a plastic
grouting, e.g. a polyester cartridge. Additionally a venting tube is introduced to the
bottom of the hole and a cementing hose is introduced approximately 25 cm into the
hole. The outer part of the hole is then sealed with sealing foam, before introducing
of cementing grout. The air in the hole will then expel through the venting tube.This cementing requires additional mounting time and is impaired by bad sealing
with the sealing foam. This results in leakage before the hole is filled and a part of
the bolt not being covered by cementing grout.The main object of the invention is to provide a device for fastening rockbolts,
which may be used more quickly and with less expensive equipment than has been
the case with known methods. Further, it has to ensure a sufficient quality and safety
of the fastening to avoid damages due to bolt deficiency caused by bad fastening. It 
is a particular object to provide a fastening giving lasting corrosion
protection, to increase the longevity and safety of the bolt.The invention is stated in the characterized part of claim 1, further features and
details being decribed in the remaining claims.To practice the invention, only an inexpensive and easily mounted tube is
required. This tube can be manufactured quite inexpensively from plastic and can be
easily mounted on the rockbolt in advance of or at mounting in the rock, i.e. at the
front

<CLAIMS>
Device for fastening of a rockbolt (12) in a hole (11) in
rock, comprising a fastening member, particularly an

expansion bushing (14) provided on an threaded part (13)
at the inner end of a rockbolt and the outer end of the

rockbolt is provided with a washer-like pressure member
(18) adapted to press against the rock (19), with a nut

(16) on a threaded part (15) at the outer end of the
rockbolt, to press against a support element (17) with an

opening (22) for supply of cementing grout for filling the
cavity (26) between the rockbolt and the rock, to increase

the fastening thereof and provide corrosion protection,
wherein the rockbolt (12) is provided with a tube (23)

extending over at least the greater part of the free length
of said rockbolt, said tube being provided to supply

cementing grout to the inner end of the rockhole,
characterized
 in that the support element (17) has at least
a partly spherical shell form with an inner space (21) for

supply of cementing grout through a hole (27) provided in

the side wall of said support element (17).
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the
support element (17) is of spherical shell form and has a

threaded opening (22) for the tube (23), the tube being
provided with an outer thread (24) at least at the outer

end, and that the hole (27) in said side wall of said
support element is also threaded.
