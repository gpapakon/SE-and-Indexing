<ABSTRACT>
Radioactive metal is recovered from solid oxides 
of the metal by exposing the oxide to a cocurrent flow of 

a first acid solution in a first contactor (9) to form 
partially reacted oxides and a solution containing the 

metal. The first solution containing the metal is drawn 
off and the partially reacted oxides are passed through a 

countercurrent flow of a second acid solution in a second 
contactor (25) to form reaction residues and a second 

solution containing the metal. The second solution containing 
the metal is drawn off and the reaction residues 

are passed through a countercurrent flow of wash water in 
a third contactor (55). The reaction residues are then 

separated from the wash water and dried.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a continuous process to
extract radioactive metal from incinerator ash and other
high-residue waste materials using a cocurrent/countercurrent
contactor system.Previously-utilized methods for processing
incinerator waste materials to extract uranium or similar
elements are described in the following United States
patents.United States Patent No. 4,509,978 to
Greenhalgh discloses a method of immobilizing sulfate ash
to recover transuranic elements. The ash is mixed with a
metal to form an alloy with the transuranic elements. The
alloy can be redissolved in a catalyzed nitric acid solution
to recover the transuranic elements.United States Patent No. 4,814,046 to Johnson
et al. discloses a process for removing transuranic elements
from a waste chloride electrolytic salt generated
during reprocessing of nuclear fuel. The salt is 
contacted with a cadmium-uranium alloy which selectively
extracts the transuranic elements from the salt.United States Patent No. 4,749,519 to Koehly
et al. discloses a process for the recovery of plutonium
contained in solid waste. The waste is contacted with
aqueous nitric acid solution for oxidizing the plutonium
present in the waste and dissolving it in the nitric acid
solution.United States Patent No. 3,882,040 to Auge et al.
discloses a process wherein incinerator ash containing
silicon is contacted with nitrosyl fluoride trihydrogen
fluoride (NOF.3HF) converting silicon present to silicon
tetrafluoride (SiF4) gas, thereby minimizing formation of
gelatinous silica polymer in the subsequent treatment of
the ash to recover plutonium, americium, and the like.United States Patent No. 4,177,241 to Divins
et al. discloses a process for recovering compounds of
enriched nuclear fuel from scrap materials. The process
yields an acid solution with nuclear fuel dissolved therein.
Apparatus for performing the disclosed process is also
disclosed.United States Patent No. 4,787,979 to Kolarik
et al. discloses a liquid-liquid two-phase extraction
process in which a feed solution is introduced into an
intermediate state of a multistage extraction apparatus.
An aqueous extractant flows through the multistate extraction
apparatus countercurrent to the extractant and contributes
to the aqueous phase. The organic extractant is
divided into at least two streams prior to introducing the
organic extractant into the apparatus. Each stream is
introduced into the apparatus at different stages, both
ahead of the intermediate stage.Prior to this, previous processing involved

A continuous process for recovering radioactive
metal from solid oxides of said metal, the process comprising:


exposing said oxide of said metal to a cocurrent
flow of a first acid solution in a first contactor means

(9) to form partially reacted oxides and a solution containing
said metal;
drawing off said solution containing said metal
and passing said partially reacted oxides through a

countercurrent flow of a second acid solution in a second
contactor means (25) to form reaction residues and a second

solution containing said metal;
drawing off said second solution containing said
metal and passing said reaction residues through a countercurrent

flow of wash water to wash said reaction residues;
and
separating said reaction residues from said wash
water.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein said
first contactor means (9) is generally horizontal so that

gases are vented from said cocurrent flow of oxides and
acid.
A process according to Claim 2, wherein about
20-30% nitric acid by weight is used as an extractant for

said metal.
A process according to Claim 3, wherein about
30% nitric acid by weight is used as an extractant for said

metal. 
A process according to Claim 4, wherein heat
(19) is applied to said first (9) and second contactor (25)

to maintain the acid solution at about 54°-77°C (130°-170°F).
A process according to Claim 5, wherein said
first and second solution containing said metal contains

fines of said oxides and included in said process is the
step of separating said fines.
An apparatus (1) for continuously recovering
radioactive metals from solid oxides of said metals, the

apparatus comprising:

a first contactor means (9) through which said
solid oxides of said metals are passed with a cocurrent

flow of an acid solution so that said acid solution extracts
said metal from said oxides of said metal to form a

solution containing said metal and partially reacted
oxides;
means (43) for drawing off said solution containing
said metal from said partially reacted oxides;
a second contactor means (25) through which said
partially reacted oxides are passed with a countercurrent

flow of a second acid solution to extract the remaining
metal from said partially reacted oxides leaving reaction

residues and a solution containing said metal;
means for drawing off said solution containing
said metal from said reaction residues; and
