<ABSTRACT>
Highly-purified immunologically-effected recombinant protein encoded by a gene of a full-length wild-type Borrelia lipoprotein, particularly the OspA encoded by the OspA gene of B.burgdorferi, useful in vaccines and test kits for Lyme disease, is prepared by inducing protein production from a host organism transformed by a plasmid vector containing the cloned gene and subsequently recovering and purifying the protein. The grown organism is lysed and contacted with a surfactant, particularly Triton X-114, which selectively extracts the desired protein from the lysed cells. Upon heating the resulting mixture to mildly-elevated temperature, a detergent phase separates out and is recovered separate from the other phases. The detergent phase is further purified from residual protein by column chromatography.

 TITLE OF INVENTIONPREPARATION OF RECOMBINANT BORRELIA PROTEINSFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to the preparation of recombinant Borrelia lipoproteins, particularly the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burqdorferi, the spirochete responsible for Ly e disease.REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation-in-part of copending United States patent application Serial No. 888,765 filed May 27, 1992, which itself is a continuation-in-part of copending United States patent application Serial No. 779,048 filed October 18, 1991. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONLyme disease is a zoonosis caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burqdorferi. The spirochete can cause serious dermatological, arthritic, neurological and other pathological disorders in an infected host. Recently Lyme disease has become a serious epidemiological concern, particularly in North America, but also elsewhere in the world.Attempts are underway to develop a vaccine against the disease and immunodiagnostic reagents useful in the detection of antibodies against the spirochete. Much attention has focused on the major outer surface protein OspA, antibodies against which have been demonstrated to provide protection against challenge with the spirochete in mice (refs. 1, 2 - identification of the literature references appears at the end of the disclosure) .Previous attempts have been made to isolate purified, soluble Borrelia lipoproteins through the growth and subsequent purification of Borrelia cell cultures. However, the growth and subsequent purification of the proteins from crude cell extracts of Borrelia is very time consuming and expensive. 

 Recombinant techniques have been suggested for producing OspA and derivatives thereof, in view of the potential for production of large quantities of pure protein material. Such techniques would involve expression of Borrelia genes in a suitable host/vector expression system, such as E. coli.Published International (PCT) Patent application No. WO 90/04411 describes a DNA fragment encoding the OspA protein of B. burσdorferi of the New York strain B31 (ATCC 35210) and containing the OSPA gene. The nucleotide sequence of the ospA gene, coding for the full-length wild-type OspA, is described in the published PCT patent application, along with the derived amino-acid sequence. Dunn et al have described the preparation of a modified form of OspA protein which is soluble, yet retains specific reactivity to antibodies against wild- type B. Burqdor eri OspA (ref.
