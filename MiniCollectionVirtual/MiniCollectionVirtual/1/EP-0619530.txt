<ABSTRACT>
A developing apparatus includes a developer 
carrying member (8) for carrying a developer (6); an elastic 

blade (26) pressed to said developer carrying member to 
regulate a layer of the developer formed on said 

developer carrying member, said blade comprising an 
electrically conductive layer (26b) and a high resistance 

layer (26c) at the developer carrying member side of the 
conductive layer; electric field generating means (19) for 

forming an oscillating electric field between said 
image bearing member and the conductive layer; wherein 

a maximum intensity of the electric field provided by 
said electric field generating means is not less than 

10‚Å∂ V/m.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developing apparatus
usable with a copying machine, printer or the like of an
electrophotographic type or an electrostatic recording type.US 4,990,959 shows a one-component developing apparatus
including a developer carrier disposed in opposition to an
electrostatic latent image receiving member and a toner
amount restricting member pressed so as to be in contact with
the developer carrier. The toner amount restricting member
includes a support member made of a plate spring and a soft
elastic member disposed on the support member at a portion
thereof to be pressed into contact with the developer
carrier.A similar apparatus is known from JP-A-57094767. Referring to Figure 1, there is shown an
example of an image forming apparatus of an
electrophotographic type. The electrophotographic
recording apparatus 1 (printer engine) is provided
with a cylindrical photosensitive drum 2 as a latent
image bearing member. The photosensitive drum 2
rotates in one direction about its rotational axis,
during which the surface thereof is uniformly charged
by a charging device 3. Thereafter, a latent image is
formed thereon by an image exposure device 4. A
developing device 5 comprises a hopper 7 for
accommodating a developer 6 and a developing sleeve 8
(developer carrying member). It supplies the
developer 6 to a latent image formed on the
photosensitive drum 2 to visualize it. Adjacent the
developing sleeve 8, a developing blade 9 as a
developer regulating member is disposed. Between the
photosensitive drum 2 and the developing sleeve 8, a
bias supplying voltage source 19 is connected to
supply an AC biased DC voltage to supply a proper 
developing bias voltage.An image on the photosensitive drum
visualized by the developer 6 is transferred onto a
transfer material 11 by a transfer device 10. The
transfer material 11 is fed by a sheet feeding roller
12, and is supplied to the transfer device 10 in
synchronism with the image on the photosensitive drum
by the registration roller 13. The visualized image
of the developer transferred onto the transfer
material 11 by the transfer drum 10 is conveyed to a
fixing device 14 with the transfer material 11, and is
fixed on the transfer material 11 by heat or pressure
into an image record. The residual developer 6
remaining on the photosensitive drum without being
transferred onto the transfer material, is removed by
a cleaning device 15. The surface of the
photosensitive drum now free of the developer 6 is
charged again by the charging device 3,
