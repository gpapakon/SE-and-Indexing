<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed to prepare a light-sensitive regular 
silver bromide or silver bromoiodide emulsion, wherein said method 

comprises the following the steps: 

precipitating silver bromide or silver bromoiodide by means of the 
double-jet or triple-jet technique in colloidal silica having a 

particle size from 0.003 µm to 0.30 µm as a protective colloid in 
the absence of any polymeric compound(s) comprising gelatin or its 

derivatives capable of forming hydrogen bridges with colloidal 
silica, except for polythioether compounds, but always in the 

presence of an onium compound, except for an ammonium compound, 
wherein the ratio by weight of said colloidal silica to the said 

onium compound(s) is between 3 and 30, and, optionally, in the 
presence of a crystal growth modifier, 
controlling the nucleation and growth steps by means of variable 
flow rate(s) of the aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and halide 

salts and/or by means of constant pAg-values during the said steps 
in the vessel in order to determine the number of nuclei quantitatively 

in the nucleation step and to avoid renucleation in the growth 
step, 
desalting the reaction medium and redispersing the silver halide, 
chemically ripening the silver halide crystals and 
adjusting the ratio by weight of the colloidal silica sol to the 
amount of silver halide, expressed as the equivalent amount of 

silver nitrate to a value of at least 0.03 at every moment 
throughout the precipitation stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a preparation method of regular 
silver bromide and bromoiodide light-sensitive emulsion crystals and 
to a light-sensitive photographic material wherein the corresponding 
emulsions are used. The effects of various precipitation conditions on the formation 
of stable AgBr crystals have been studied in a balanced double-jet 
precipitation by Leubner, Wey and Jagannathan and have been disclosed 
in e.g. Phot. Sc. Eng., Vol. 21 (1977), p. 14, Vol. 23 (1977), 
p. 248-252 and Vol. 24 (1980), p. 268-272; in J. Imaging Sci., Vol. 
34(1990), p. 202-206; in J. Cryst. Growth, Vol. 51 (1981), p. 601-606; 
and in "Proceedings ICPS Int. Congress of Phot. Science 1986": 
Progress in Basic Principles of Imaging Systems, p. 60. From these documents the number of nuclei generated during the 
nucleation stage can be calculated in a semi-emperical way, provided 
that the values in the reaction vessel of pAg, temperature, concentration 
of silver complexing reagents and flow rate of the silver 
and halide containing solutions are controlled during the said 
stage. In these well-defined circumstances the crystal size distribution 
at the end of the precipitation stage is perfectly predictable 
but an important condition is that during the process of precipitation, 
proceeding in an aqueous solution of gelatin as protective 
colloid, two principal stages can be distinctly provided, namely a 
nucleation stage and a growth stage. During the nucleation stage no agglomeration may occur so that 
the number of nuclei formed stays predictable, whereas during the 
growth stage further control is required in such a way that no 
renucleation can appear. Although playing a crucial role in both stages of the precipitation, 
the role of the protective colloid is sometimes underestimated: 
said protective colloid has to be considered, not only as a 
dispersing medium for the fully grown crystals, but particularly as  
 
a stabilizing medium for the nuclei. So aggregation of nuclei can be 
prevented and during the further crystal growth stage the interaction 
of the protective colloid with the growing crystal surface 
moderates the crystal growth rate, thereby preventing renucleation 
as has been suggested by Antoniades and Wey in J. Imaging Sci. and 
Technol. Vol. 36 (1992), p. 517-524. From the considerations given above it can be concluded that the 
protective colloid is determining to a large extent the average 
crystal diameter and the homogeneity of the crystal size distribution 
and is offering the
