 ADJUSTABLE CONCRETE FORMWORK SYSTEMFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to a novel adjustable concrete formwork system which can be used in the manufac¬ ture of a wide range of cross-sectional shaped concrete structures.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is directed to a cast-in-place or precast concrete form comprising: (a) at least one first member, with a web located on a first side of the first member; (b) at least one second member, with a second web located on the first side of the second member; and (c) at least one connecting member connecting telescopically the respective first member, with the respective second member, said telescoping connecting member enabling the first and second members to be moved relative to one another.An elongated strip can be positioned between the two webs. The first and second webs can be planar and positioned one above the other. The lower portion of the upper web, and the upper portion of the lower web, together can protrude away from the first and second members to form a common protrusion. The first member can be elevated relative to the second member. A web can extend between the protruding upper and lower webs.At least two first members can be spatially arranged relative to one another with at least two second spatially arranged members. A strip can extend from the top of the first upper member to the top of the other upper member, and a second strip can extend from the bottom of the lower member to the bottom of the other lower member.The concrete form can have one or more walers replace the first member or the second member. The length of the connecting member can be varied. The first member or the second member or the connecting member can be eliminated in certain configurations.The form can be arranged in parallel and opposed to a second concrete form of the same or a different 

configuration, the upper and lower webs facing one another to define a cavity in which concrete can be poured to form a concrete beam having a rectangular cross-section, an "I" cross-section, a "T" cross-section, a "J" cross-section, a "C" cross-section, an "L" cross-section, or a corrugated cross-section. The pair of opposed forms can be held together by snap-ties.DRAWINGS Figure 1 illustrates an end view of a conven¬ tional timber formwork system comprising timber, walers, snap ties and keeper wedges, for constructing a concrete beam of rectangular cross-section.Figure 2 illustrates an end view of a conven- tional timber formwork system for constructing a

CLAIMS
1. A caεt-in-place or precaεt concrete form charac¬ terized by: (a) at leaεt one first member (70) , with a web
(84) located on a first εide of the firεt member;
(b) at leaεt one εecond member (72) , with a εecond web (86) located on the firεt side of the second member; and (c) at leaεt one connecting member (98) connect¬ ing telescopically the respective first member (70) , with the reεpective εecond member (72) , said telescoping con¬ necting member (98) enabling the first and second members (70 and 72) to be moved relative to one another.
2. A form as claimed in claim 1 wherein an elongated strip (76) is positioned between the two webs.
3. A form as claimed in claim 1 wherein the webs (84,86) are planar and are positioned one above the other.
4. A form as claimed in claim 1 wherein the lower portion of the upper web (90) , and the upper portion of the lower web (92) , together protrude away from the firεt and second members (70,72) to form a common protrusion.
5. A form as claimed in claim 1 wherein the first member (70) is elevated relative to the second member (72) and a web (94) extends between the upper and lower webs (102) .
6. A form as claimed in claim 1 wherein at least two first members (70) and at leaεt two correεponding εecond members (72) are arranged spatially from one another in vertical parallel orientation. 


7. A form as claimed in claim 6 wherein a strip (78) extends from the top of one first upper member (70) to the top of the other spatially disposed upper member (70) , and a second strip (80) extends from the bottom of one lower member (72) to the bottom of the other lower member (72) .
8. A form as claimed in claim 1 arranged parallel and opposed to a second concrete form of the same configur¬ ation, the first and second webs (84,86) facing one another to define a cavity in which concrete can be poured to form a concrete beam having a rectangular cross-section.
