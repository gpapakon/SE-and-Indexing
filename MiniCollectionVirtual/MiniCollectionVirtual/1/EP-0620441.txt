<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
rotational accelerometer used, for example, for 
measuring linear acceleration and rotation rates and 
acceleration of a moving body. Vibratory gyroscopes taking many base forms, 
such as disks, tuning forks, cylinders and 
hemispherical shells base their sensing capabilities 
upon precession of a standing wave in a vibratory 
member. Such devices typically find use in commercial 
avionics and navigational systems and provide a very 
high degree of sensitivity and accuracy required in 
those fields. Other types of rotation sensors rely on 
more conventional motor driven gyroscopes to indicate 
rotation. Shortfalls of either general types of 
rotation sensors, that is those relying on vibratory 
members or motor driven gyroscopes, include size, 
cost, requirement for power input to maintain a 
detectable quantity and in the case of motor driven 
gyroscopes moving parts such as gimbals, ball 
bearings, slip rings and other mechanical features. Many automotive systems would benefit from a 
low cost rotational quantity sensor. Non-exhaustive 
exemplary system usages include vehicle navigational 
systems, chassis control systems, such as active 
suspensions and active rear steering, and anti-slip 
regulation systems such as antilock braking and 
limited slip acceleration. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved rotational accelerometer. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a rotational 
accelerometer as specified in claims 7, 10, 11, 14 and 
15. Preferably, the rotational accelerometer 
comprises a pair of structurally integrated,  
 
operationally independent linear accelerometers both 
responsive to acceleration normal to a common plane 
therebetween. Linear accelerometers are separated by 
a known distance and provide independent measures of 
acceleration which are used to derive rotational 
acceleration, rotational rate, and rotational 
direction from the linear acceleration signals. A proof mass may be disposed at an 
unsupported end of a cantilevered flexure member. In a preferred embodiment, there is provided 
a thick film rotational accelerometer which comprises 
an alumina fulcrum section having a pair of integral 
substantially coplanar and co-symmetrical lever 
sections extending therefrom. At the interface of the 
alumina fulcrum section and each lever section is a 
respective fulcrum end. The opposite end of each 
lever section provides support for a respective proof 
mass, each substantially equivalent and
