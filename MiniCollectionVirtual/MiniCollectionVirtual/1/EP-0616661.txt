<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for converting rotary to reciprocating rotary motion comprises a housing (H), driveshaft (D), crank linkage, planet (P), carrier (C), flywheel (F), and timing assembly (M). The driveshaft (D), journaled in the housing (H), carries a flywheel (F) incorporating a ring gear (F-2). The carrier is journaled in the flywheel and carries a planet (P) which engages the ring gear (F-2). As the flywheel (F) revolves with the driveshaft (D) the timing assembly turns the carrier which drives the planet (P) around the ring gear causing a point on the planet gear pitch cylinder to execute a reciprocating motion with respect to the flywheel. A crank linkage connects the planet along the reciprocating axis to an assembly revolving with the driveshaft imparting a reciprocating rotating motion to it.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MECHANISM FOR CONVERTING ROTARY TO RECIPROCATINGROTARY MOTIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to mechanisms for converting between rotary and reciprocating rotary motion.2. Brief Description of the Prior ArtMechanisms converting the motion of vanes or pistons that reciprocate while rotating to rotary driveshaft motion and vice versa are numerous and well known in the art. A typical use is in a vane engine where each of a pair of concentric vane rotors is connected by a mechanism to an output shaft. The motion of a vane rotor rotating at some constant angular frequency, while simultaneously reciprocating at twice that frequency is converted by the connected mechanism to constant rotation of the output shaft. Mechanisms, able to generate a simple harmonic reciprocating motion component (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,330,629, 1,946,136), have few load paths and transmit power through line contacts and therefore limit capacity. Other designs, with the reciprocating component approximating simple harmonic motion (e.g. U.S. Patent No. 1,603,630), have high inertial forces which limit their speed.OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THEINVENTION The principal object of the present invention is to provide a simple, robust drive mechanism to transform between reciprocating rotary and rotary motion. Another object of the present invention is to provide a commercially feasible drive mechanism for a pump or internal combustion engine of the reciprocating rotating type.Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the following description proceeds.In accordance with the foregoing objects, a drive mechanism of the present invention comprises a housing, driveshaft, crank linkage, planet, carrier, flywheel, and 

 timing assembly. Details of lubrication, bearings, fasteners and the like are not discussed as they fall within the scope of competent engineering work.The driveshaft, joumaled in the housing, carries a flywheel incorporating a ring gear. The carrier is joumaled in the flywheel and carries a planet which engages the ring gear. As the flywheel revolves with the driveshaft the timing assembly turns the carrier which drives the planet around the ring gear causing a point on the planet gear pitch cylinder to execute a reciprocating motion with respect to the flywheel. A crank linkage connects the planet along the reciprocating axis to an assembly revolving with the driveshaft imparting a reciprocating rotating motion to it.DESCRIPTION OF THE
