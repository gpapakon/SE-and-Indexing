<ABSTRACT>
The new casein hydrolyzate does not contain any unhydrolyzed casein and is characterized by a defined molecular weight distribution. The method is characterized by being performed by means of three defined proteolytic enzymes and a non-pH-stat method. The casein hydrolyzate exhibits an optimal balance between DH, free amino acids, bitterness and yield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention comprises a casein hydrolyzate and a method for 
production of such casein hydrolyzate. Casein hydrolyzates are mainly used as constitutents in baby food, and 
many different casein hydrolyzates and methods for production of casein 
hydrolyzates are known. In relation to casein hydrolyzates and methods for 
production thereof at least four aspects are important in order to generate the best 
possible result: 1) a high DH (Degree of Hydrolysis), which results in shorther 
peptides in the product and thus in a low allergenicity, 2) low content of free amino 
acids, which results in a low osmolality which is preferred when the product is 
incorporated in a diet, 3) low bitterness, and 4) high yield. Many methods for production of a casein hydrolyzate with good 
organoleptic properties can be carried out with a low yield only. Stated more 
generally, it is difficult to obtain an optimal balance between the above indicated four 
aspects. Thus, it is the purpose of the invention to indicate a casein hydrolyzate and 
a method for production of such casein hydrolyzate with optimal properties, i.e. with 
a high DH, a low content of free amino acids, low bitterness and high yield. Surprisingly, according to the invention it has been found that a certain 
combination of specified enzymes and a non-pH-stat hydrolysis provides a process 
for production of a casein hydrolyzate with an optimal balance between DH, free 
amino acids, bitterness and yield. The casein hydrolyzate according to the invention does not contain any 
unhydrolyzed casein, and it is characterized by the fact that the casein hydrolyzate 
is completely soluble or almost completely soluble in an aqueous medium with a pH 
value in the pH range of 3.5 - 7.0, that it is of good organoleptic quality, that it 
contains peptides in relative amounts corresponding to the following MW distribution 
(MW is an abbreviation for molecular weight):  
 
weight-% MW > 50000-1 5000 > MW > 150015-35 1500 > MW > 50040-60 500 > MW15-35  
and free amino acids in an amount less than 10% and that the number average 
molecular weight (Mn) is 400-650. The MW distribution of peptides in protein hydrolyzates is determined as 
follows. The sample is diluted, filtered and injected into a liquid chromatographic 
system, operating in the Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) mode. this 
separation technique utilizes a liquid flow through a column filled with porous 
particles, having pores with a well-defined pore diameter. When a solution of
