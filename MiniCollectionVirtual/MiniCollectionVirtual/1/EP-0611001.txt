<ABSTRACT>
The detection of residues of antibacterials such as 
antibiotics and sulpha compounds in liquids such as milk, 

water, meat juice, serum or urine is disclosed. A test unit 
comprises an agar medium inoculated with a suitable test 

organism and two or more redox indicators.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the
detection of residues of antibacterial compounds in liquids.
The invention also relates to a unit for the detection of
residues of antibacterial compounds in liquids and the use
of the unit.Similar tests have been described in GB-A-1467439,
EP-A-0005891 and DE 3613794. These documents all deal with
"ready to use" tests that make use of a test organism and
will give a result generally between 2½ to 3½ hours by the
change of colour of an acid-base or redox indicator added to
the test system. The principle is that when an antibacterial
compound is present in the sample liquid in a sufficient
concentration to inhibit the growth of the test organism the
colour of the indicator will stay the same, whilst when no
inhibition occurs, the growth of the test organism is
accompanied by the formation of acid or reduced metabolites
that will change the colour of the indicator. In all these
tests a single indicator is used to detect the formation of
acid or reduced metabolites.According to this invention a marked reduction in
test duration, up to one hour, can be achieved when a
combination of two or more indicators is used. Such a
shortened test duration is of importance to the user because
the quality of the sample liquid is known more quickly thus
allowing an earlier delivery or processing etc.Therefore the invention provides a method for
detecting antibacterials in a test sample which comprises 
a) bringing a test organism and at least two redox
indicators into an agar medium,b) allowing the test sample to come into contact
with the agar medium such that antibacterials in the test
sample inhibit the test organism in the agar medium and the test organism is a strain of Bacillus stearothermophilus.The present invention also provides a unit for
detecting antibacterials which comprises an agar medium
comprising a test organism, optionally a separate nutrient
source, and two or more redox indicators which each can be
present in the agar medium or in the
separate nutrient source and the test organism is a strain of Bacillus stearothermophilus.The unit of the present invention is useful for
detecting residues of antibacterials such as sulpha
compounds and antibiotics.The unit may be used for detecting antibacterials in
liquids, for example milk, water, meat juices, serum or
urine.A preferred strain of Bacillus
stearothermophilus is Bacillus
stearothermophilus var. calidolactis C953. Bacillus
stearothermophilus may be introduced into the agar medium
preferably in
