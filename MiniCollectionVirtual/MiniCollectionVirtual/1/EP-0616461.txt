<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held optical scanner (10) comprises an optical 
sensor (101) for generating a data signal representative 

of a scanned object (11), a housing (12) for hand-displaceably 
supporting the optical sensor; a roller (30) 

mounted on the housing for enabling rolling displacement 
of the housing over a scanned object in a predetermined 

scan direction; a displacement sensing device (70) for 
sensing the angular displacement of the roller and 

generating a displacement signal representative thereof; a 
motor (50) drivingly linked to the roller for applying a 

driving torque thereto; and a controller (122) for 
actuating the motor responsive to the displacement signal 

for angularly accelerating and decelerating the roller for 
urging an operator to hand displace the housing across a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to hand-held
optical scanners and, more particularly, to hand-held
optical scanners in which the speed of hand scanning is
controlled through the use of tactile feedback to the
operator.Optical scanners are used to produce machine-readable
data which is representative of a scanned
object, e.g. a page of printed text. Optical scanners
employ line-focus systems to image scanned objects.In a line-focus system, a light beam from an
illuminated line object is imaged by a lens on a linear
photosensor array which is positioned remotely from the
line object. In an optical scanning device, the
illuminated line object of the line-focus system is
commonly referred to as a "scan line". The linear
photosensor array is a single dimension array of
photoelements which correspond to small area locations
along the line object. These small area locations on the
line object are commonly referred to as "picture
elements" or "pixels". In response to light from its
corresponding pixel location on the line object, each
photoelement produces a data signal which is
representative of the intensity of light which is
impinged upon it. All of the photoelement data signals
are received and processed by an appropriate data
processing system which may subsequently store the data
on a suitable medium or generate a display signal 
therefrom for reproducing an image of the object with a
display device such as a CRT or printer.Optical scanners and various components thereof are
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,926,041 for OPTICAL
SCANNER of David Wayne Boyd; U.S. Patent No. 4,709,144
for COLOR IMAGER UTILIZING NOVEL TRICHROMATIC BEAM
SPLITTER AND PHOTOSENSOR of Kent J. Vincent; and U.S.
Patent No. 4,870,268 for COLOR COMBINER AND SEPARATOR AND
IMPLEMENTATIONS of Kent J. Vincent and Hans D. Neuman.Most optical scanners have photoelectric conversion
assemblies which employ charge coupled device (CCD) type
photosensors. All of the photoelements in a CCD linear
array have the same fixed operating (sampling) interval,
e.g. one millisecond. A data signal is produced by each
element at the end of an operating interval and is
representative of an average of the light intensity which
the element experiences during the operating interval.
The scan speed of a scanner employing a linear CCD
photosensor array is thus limited by the CCD operating
interval. If the scanner displacement rate is greater
than one scan line width per CCD operating interval, the
scanner will not be able to collect enough data to
produce an

A hand-held optical scanner (10) comprising:

a) optical sensor means (101) for generating
a data signal representative of a scanned object

(11);
b) housing means (12) for hand-displaceably

supporting said optical sensor means;
c) roller means (30, 32, 40, 42) mounted
on said housing means for enabling rolling displacement

of said housing means over a scanned object
in a predetermined scan direction (13);
d) displacement sensing means (70) for sensing
the angular displacement of said roller means

(30) and generating a displacement signal representative
thereof;
e) motor means (50) drivingly linked to said
roller means (30) for applying a driving torque

thereto;
f) control means (122) for actuating said
motor means (50) responsive to said displacement

signal for angularly accelerating and decelerating
said roller means (30) for urging an operator to

hand displace said housing means (12) across a
scanned object (11) within a predetermined speed

range (97) which is optimal for scanning.
The scanner of claim 1 wherein said control
means (122) actuates said motor means (50) to apply a

constant accelerating torque to said roller means (30)
when said housing means (12) is being displaced across a

scanned object (11) at a speed below said predetermined
speed range (97).
The scanner of claim 2 wherein said constant
accelerating torque applied to said roller means (30)

when said housing means is being displaced across a 
scanned object at a speed below said predetermined speed

range (97) is sufficiently low to enable an operator to
hold the housing means stationary on a scanned ordinary

paper document (11) without causing slipping between the
roll means and the paper document whereby a user is enabled

to slow the rate of scanning to below said predetermined
speed range to facilitate various hand scanning

operations including changing the hand which holds the
scanner and slowing or stopping scanning motion at a

terminal edge portion of a scanned object.
The scanner of any of claims 1-3 wherein said
control means (122) actuates said motor means (50) to

apply a decelerating torque to said roller means when
said housing means is being displaced across a scanned

object at a speed above said predetermined speed range
(97).
The scanner of claim 4 wherein the scanner
(10) has a predetermined maximum scanning speed for proper

operation of said optical sensor means (101) and
wherein said decelerating torque applied to said roller

means (30) when said housing means (12) is being displaced
across a scanned object at a speed above said

predetermined speed range is sufficiently great so as to
cause slipping between the roller means (30) and a

scanned ordinary paper document (11) at a speed below
said predetermined maximum scanning speed of said optical

sensor means whereby scanning at an inoperable speed is
prevented.
The scanner of claim 1 wherein said motor
means (50) comprises a direct current motor operably connected

to a battery (90), said motor being connected for
receiving electrical energy from said battery for accelerating

said motor in response to a control signal from
said control means (122) when said housing displacement 

speed is below said predetermined optimal speed range,

predetermined optimal speed range.
A method of scanning an object (11) with a
hand-held optical scanner (16) having rollers (30, 32)

adapted for enabling rolling displacement of the
scanner over the object comprising:


a) applying an accelerating torque to the
rollers (30) when a user is scanning an object (11)

at a speed below a predetermined speed range (97);
and
b) applying a decelerating torque to the
rollers (30) when a user is scanning an object at a

speed above a predetermined speed range (97).
The method of claim 7 wherein the step of applying
an accelerating torque comprises applying a constant

torque which is sufficiently low to enable an operator
to hold the scanner (10) stationary on a scanned

ordinary paper document (11) without causing slipping between
the roller (30) and the paper document.
The method of claim 7 or 8 wherein said optical
sensor means (101) has a predetermined maximum scanning

speed (99) for proper operation and wherein the step of
applying a decelerating torque comprises:

   applying a decelerating torque which is sufficiently
great so as to cause slipping between the

roller means (30) and a scanned ordinary paper document
(11) at a speed below the predetermined maximum

scanning speed of said optical sensor means whereby
scanning at an inoperable speed is prevented.
