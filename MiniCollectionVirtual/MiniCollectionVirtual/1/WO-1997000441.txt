<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: ELECTROCHEMICAL CELLFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a biosensor and more particularly to an electrochemicalbiosensor for determining the concentration of an analyte in a carrier. The invention isparticularly useful for determining the concentration of glucose in blood and is describedherein with reference to that use but it should be understood that the invention isapplicable to other analytic determinations.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONElectrochemical biosensors generally comprise a cell having a working electrode,a counter electrode and a reference electrode. Sometimes the function ofthe counter andreference electrodes are combined in a single electrode called a "counter/reference"electrode or "pseudo reference electrode". As herein used the term "counter electrode" includes a counter/reference electrode where the context so admits.The sample containing the analyte is brought into contact with a reagentcontaining an enryme and a redox mediator in the cell. Either the mediator is reduced 

(receives at least one electron) while the analyte is oxidised (donates at least one electron) or visa versa. Usually it is the analyte which is oxidised and the mediator which is reduced. The invention will be herein described principally with reference tothat system but it is also applicable to systems in which the analyte is reduced and themediator oxidised.Electrochemical glucose analysers such as those used by diabetics to monitor blood glucose levels or such as are used in clinics and hospitals are commonly based upon the use of an enzyme such as glucose oxidase dehydrogenase (GOD) and a redoxmediator such as a ferricyanide or ferrocyanide. In such prior art system, the sample(e.g. blood) containing the analyte (e.g. glucose) is brought into contact with the reagents in the cell. Glucose is oxidised to gluconic acid and the glucose oxidase is thereby reduced. The mediator then re-oxidizes the glucose oxidase and is reduced in the process. The reduced mediator is then re-oxidized when it transfers electrons to the working electrode. After allowing passage of a predetermined time, sufficient to obtain an accurate estimate ofthe Faraday current, the concentration of glucose is estimated from the magnitude ofthe current or voltage signal then measured.Prior art electrochemical cells consist of two (or three) adjacent electrodes spaced apart on one side of an insulator and adapted for connection to a measuring device. A target area on which the blood sample is placed is defined on or between the
