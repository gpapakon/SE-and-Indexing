<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a natural environment 
observation system used for observing natural phenomenon, such 
as astronomical and oceanic information. A conventional natural environment observation system 
is described in a Japanese laying open publication (Kokai) 
Heisei 4-297882, as a satellite navigation receiver. In this 
satellite navigation receiver, information on the latitude, 
longitude, height above sea level at the present address and 
information on orbits of constellations are supplied from a 
satellite navigation receiver (GPS) and a memory, respectively, 
to an arithmetic unit. The arithmetic unit calculates the 
elevation and azimuth angles of the constellations, and 
calculates the appearance times of the constellations in 
accordance with the elevation and azimuth angles; anybody can 
observe for a required constellation easily. According to the conventional natural environment 
navigation system, however, it is difficult to observe required 
information timely. Further, it tends to miss observing the 
required constellation in the good situation. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to 
provide a natural environment observation system by which the  
 
required information may be observed timely. It is another object of the invention to provide a 
natural environment observation system by which required 
information can be observed certainly in the good situation. According to the invention, a natural environment 
observation system includes means for detecting the present 
location (address); means for providing the present date and 
time; means for storing natural phenomenon data, such as 
astronomical data, oceanic data, etc.; and means for processing 
the natural phenomenon data, in accordance with the present 
location and time and the kind of information to be observed. Figure 1 is a front view showing a natural environment 
observation system according to a first preferred embodiment of 
the invention. Figure 2 is a perspective view illustrating a part of 
the observation system shown in Fig. 1. Figure 3 is a block diagram showing the circuitry 
structure of the observation system. Figure 4 is an explanatory diagram showing an initial 
menu which is displayed on an LCD of the observation system. Figures 5 and 6 are explanatory diagrams showing whole 
sky charts which are displayed by the observation system. Figure 7 is an explanatory diagram showing a
