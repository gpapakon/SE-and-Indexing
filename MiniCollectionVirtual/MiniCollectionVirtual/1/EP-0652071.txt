<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flux-cored wire 
for gas shield arc welding, and particularly to a flux-cored 
wire for gas shield arc welding capable of 
reducing the generation amount of fume, which is 
suitable for welding of mild steel, high tensile 
strength steel, low alloy steel and the like. Recently, there has been a problem in lack of man 
power in the whole industrial field. In particular, the 
industries of steel-frame work, machine-making, and 
shipbuilding have been seriously short of welders, and 
have developed techniques for enhancement of efficiency, 
automation and robotic process for welding, and also 
have made efforts to improve the hard, dirty and 
dangerous welding work environments. Because of lack of welders, flux-cored wires for 
gas shield arc welding have increasingly required in 
terms of (1) easy welding, and (2) high efficient 
welding. In particular, metal based flux-cored wires 
have a feature of lowering the generation amount of slag  
 
in addition to the above advantages (1) and (2), and are 
expected to be more widely used. However, the wires of 
this kind have a disadvantage in making poor the welding 
work environments resulting from generation of a large 
amount of welding fume. Techniques of reducing welding fume have been 
disclosed, for example in Japanese Patent Publication 
Nos. 1403569, 1572313 and 1572327. In particular, it is 
well known that the reduction of the contents of C and 
O₂ in a sheath is effective to reduce welding fume. 
However, metal based flux-cored wires are used with a 
high current (for example, 300 to 500 A) to obtain a 
high deposition rate, to thus exponentially increase the 
generation amount of welding fume. This drawback cannot 
be solved by the conventional techniques. On the other hand, titania based flux-cored wires 
have a feature being low in the generation amount of 
spatter and excellent in bead appearance, and further 
being easily used for welding in all positions, so that 
they have been widely used in the industries of 
shipbuilding, bridge construction, and machine-making. 
However, on the other hand, the lack of welders has 
become severe because of the harsh welding environments  
 
at high temperatures and with a large amount of welding 
fume. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
flux-cored wire for gas shield arc welding which is 
capable of reducing the generation amount of fume. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a flux-cored wire for gas shield arc welding 
wherein the
