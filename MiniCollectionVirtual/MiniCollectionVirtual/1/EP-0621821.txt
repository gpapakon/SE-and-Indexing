<ABSTRACT>
An anti-splinter device (16) for sawing machines having a saw blade (10) can be operationally linked to the sawing machine, be laid on workpieces and arranged at the side of the saw blade (10), in the area where the saw blade teeth (14) come out of the workpiece. The anti-splinter device (16) cooperates under pressure with the saw blade teeth (14) that come out of the workpiece.

Sawing machine having a saw blade with an anti-splintering 
device, which can be connected operationally 

to the sawing machine, can be laid on workpieces and can 
be arranged laterally in relation to the saw blade and in 

the region of the saw blade teeth emerging from the 
workpiece, the anti-splintering device (16, 1116) being 

in pressure contact with the saw blade (10) on at least 
one side in the region of the emerging saw blade teeth 

(14), characterized in that a first region (32) of the 
anti-splintering device (16, 1116) is supported with an 

adjustable force on the at least one side of the saw 
blade (10) outside the region of the saw blade teeth 

(14), a further region (34) of the anti-splintering 
device (16, 1116), which region can be laid on the 

workpiece, being arranged with a minimum clearance and 
essentially without a supporting force relative to the 

saw blade (10) on the at least one side of the saw blade 
teeth (14) after the sawing machine is switched on, and 

this further region (34) consisting of a material, for 
example wood, plastic or the like, which can be removed 

by the saw blade teeth (14). 
Sawing machine according to Claim 1, 
characteri
zed in that the anti-splintering device (16, 
116) is of multi-part configuration, one part containing 

the first region, a sensor (32), and another part 
containing the further region, the anti-splintering 

member (34). 
Sawing machine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the anti-splintering device (16, 

1116) has a sensor (32, 1132, 1134) in pressure contact  
 

with the body (30) of the saw blade (10), which sensor 
supports the anti-splintering member (34) which is in 

pressure contact with the teeth (14) of the saw blade. 
Sawing machine according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the anti-splintering member (34) is 

adjustable relative to the sensor (32) and in that the 
sensor (32) is designed as a dog for the anti-splintering 

member (34). 
Sawing machine according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the sensor (32, 1132, 1134) 

consists of a bearing material. 
Sawing machine according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the anti-splintering device (16) is 

radially adjustable relative to the saw blade (10) and 
can thus be set. 
Sawing machine according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the anti-splintering device (16) 

can be connected to the sawing machine in an articulated 
manner and can be pivoted about the axis (24) of the saw 

blade (10) or about an axis (25) extending parallel to 
this axis (24). 
Sawing machine according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the anti-splintering device (16, 

1116) interacts with at least one spring element (26, 28), 
by means of which the pressure of the anti-splintering 

device (16, 1116) acting on the saw blade (10) can be 
determined. 
Sawing machine according to Claim 1 having a 
sawing table, characterized in that the further region 

(34, 1120, 1122) of the anti-splintering device (16, 
1116) which can be laid on the workpiece (12) lies in a 

plane of contact defined by the workpiece (12) and the 
sawing table (20) or projects from the sawing table (20) 

towards the workpiece (12). 
Sawing machine according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the anti-splintering device (16) is 

accommodated in a housing (50) which can be releasably 
connected to the sawing machine. 
Sawing machine according to one of Claims 1 to  
 

10, characterized in that the anti-splintering device 
(1116) consists of a plug part (1118) which can be 

releaseably connected to the sawing machine and has two 
anti-splintering members (1120, 1122) which can be 

arranged laterally in relation to the saw blade (18) and 
can be brought into pressure contact with the saw blade 

(10). 
Sawing machine according to Claim 11, characterised 
in that the anti-splintering members (1120, 1122) 

are articulated on the plug part (1118). 
Sawing machine according to either of Claims 11 
to 12, characterized in that the anti-splintering members 

(1120, 1122) interact with at least one spring element
