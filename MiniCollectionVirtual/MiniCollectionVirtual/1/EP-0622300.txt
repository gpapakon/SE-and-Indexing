<ABSTRACT>
A process and an apparatus for packaging containers in 
a carrier in two rows, in which a first half carrier is formed 

from a first blank by bringing a bottom portion into a 
horizontal position, placing a first longitudinal wall portion 

perpendicularly thereto, folding two side wall portions and 
partition flaps cut from the first longitudinal wall portion 

into a position perpendicular to the first longitudinal wall 
portion, inserting containers between the side wall portions 

and the flaps and bringing a second longitudinal wall portion 
into a position parallel to the first longitudinal wall 

portion and connecting it with the side wall portions, after 
which, in a similar manner, a second half carrier with 

containers is formed from an identical blank and both half 
carriers are composed by connecting two corresponding longitudinal
 
wall portions to form a carrier with two rows of 

containers. The blanks can be made with a minimum of waste 
material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for packaging 
containers in a carrier in two rows of each at least two 
pieces, in which process the containers are fed in rows to 
place them in the carrier and the carrier is made from two 
blanks and is at least partly erected around the containers 
and glued up. This invention also relates to an apparatus for 
carrying out such a process as well as to a blank to be used 
therein. A process as referred to in the preceding paragraph is 
known from US-A-2 276 129. In this process a semi-manufactured 
carrier is made from two substantially equal blanks, which 
semi-manufactured carrier can be stored and transported in 
substantially flat form. For filling with containers, the 
semi-manufactured carrier must be folded out in hat form and 
pushed from above over a group of two rows of bottles. The 
bottle necks must then move along two freely hinged, suspending 
flaps, which may cause problems, breakdown and fracture of 
containers upon improper contact between the bottles and the 
flaps. After completion of pushing on the hat form, the 
carrier is closed around the bottles by folding two bottom 
flaps, which initially extend vertically downwards, towards 
each other and securing them together. During this folding up, 
the bottles, while being supported on a stationary plate, are 
pushed further by laterally engaging conveyors. An appreciable 
disadvantage of the carrier with containers thus obtained is  
 
that a partitioning is lacking, so that the bottles may bump 
each other, which not only causes sound nuisance but first has 
a disfiguring effect on the appearance of the bottles and may 
then lead to damage and even to fracture. Further, GB-A-2 086 350 discloses a process in which 
first a partition wall with a partitioning is formed, which is 
then pushed over a group of bottles, after which a tray-like 
body is formed around the combination thus obtained, which 
tray-like body is glued to the partition wall with partitioning. 
In this manner, mutual contact between the bottles in the 
package is indeed avoided, but the problems caused by pushing 
on continue to exist. Further, the carrier is composed of two 
quite different blanks, one blank being composed and erected 
before and the other during contact with the bottles. Both the 
mutually different shapes and the methods of treatment of the 
blanks each cause specific logistic problems. Moreover, the 
blanks require relatively much material owing to the irregular 
shape of their outer circumference, i.e. there
