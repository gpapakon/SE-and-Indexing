<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus for forming desired images 

continuously onto print sheets (P). The apparatus 
comprises a printing part, a primary sheet feed mechanism 

(10) for extracting one by one the print sheets (P) 
stacked on a sheet feed table (31), and a secondary sheet 

feed mechanism (1) for taking each print sheet (P) 
extracted by the primary sheet feed mechanism (10) and 

for feeding the print sheet (P) toward the printing part 
at a rate corresponding to the printing speed of the 

printing part. The secondary sheet feed mechanism (1) 
further comprises a timing roller (5a) and a guide roller 

(5b) in contact with the print sheet (P) for feeding 
thereof, an electromagnetic clutch for intermittently 

activating any of the timing roller (5a) and the guide 
roller (5b), and a controller (20) for receiving a 

detection signal showing a rotating status of the 
printing part and for supplying the electromagnetic 

clutch accordingly with an output signal (S5) in 
synchronism with the rotating status.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus for forming images on sheets of printing paper
and, more particularly, an image forming apparatus
capable of printing images efficiently on a large number
of print sheets.Fig. 10 is a side view of a conventional image
forming apparatus that functions as a mimeograph machine.
A thermally prepared original sheet is stuck around the
outer circumference of a drum 30 constituting part of a
printing section. Print sheets P are fed continuously
between the drum 30 and a press roller 30a, whereby the
image of the original is mimeographed onto the print
sheets.The print sheets P are stacked on a sheet feed table
31. The sheets are picked up one by one, from top sheet
to bottom, by a scraper roller 32 and a pickup roller 33.
The two rollers constitute a primary sheet feed mechanism
37. The picked up sheets are fed toward the drum 30.Between the drum 30 and the pickup roller 33 is
provided a timing roller 40 which, driven intermittently,
constitutes part of a secondary sheet feed mechanism 38.
The timing roller 40 in operation transports each print
sheet P for printing by the drum 30 at an appropriate 
timing synchronous with the drum revolutions.As outlined, the typical mimeograph machine
comprises the primary and secondary sheet feed mechanisms
37 and 38. The two-stage sheet feed arrangement is
required for the mimeograph machine to operate at a
higher speed than other printers such as copiers. The
primary sheet feed mechanism 37 extracts the print sheets
P slowly and one by one from the sheet feed table 31; the
mechanism makes sure that it does not pick up
inadvertently two or more sheets at a time. The
secondary sheet feed mechanism 38 feeds the print sheets
P to the drum 30 rotating at a high speed, the rate of
print sheet feed being synchronized with the drum
revolutions. The mimeograph machine may be switched
stepwise from low to high printing speeds.A belt 46 is held taut over the drum 30, a plurality
of idlers 35, and the shaft 45a of a motor 45. The motor
45 rotates the drum 30. The driving force of the motor
45 is also used to activate the timing roller 40
intermittently in an intermittent driving mechanism 50.The intermittent driving mechanism is structured as
follows: a guide roller cam 51 and a timing roll cam 52
are attached fixedly to the shaft 45a of the motor 45.
One end 53a of a substantially fan-shaped gear 53 is in
contact with the guide roller cam 51, and one end 54a of
a timing lever 54 is in contact with the timing roll cam
52. The
