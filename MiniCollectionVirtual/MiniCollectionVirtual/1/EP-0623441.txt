<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a calender, in the calender stands of which there are mounted in an offset manner two outer rolls one above the other and at least two inner rolls, arranged between the two outer rolls, of which rolls the two outer rolls are adapted such that they can be set and displaced, and the one inner roll is mounted fixedly in the calender stands while the other inner roll is adapted such that it can be displaced by adjusting means for setting the width of the roll nip, the bearing housings of the displaceable inner roll being displaceable in guides of a slot-like design in the calender stands and the adjusting means acting on the bearing housings of the outer settable and displaceable rolls acting in mutually perpendicular directions. It is the object of the invention to provide a universal calender by simple means and in a simple way. The invention consists in the parallel arrangement of the displacing direction of the displaceable central roll with respect to the displaceable and settable outer roll assigned to it and in the capability of this outer roll, above and beyond the setting capability, for it to be displaced by the travel and the direction of the movable inner roll by at least a distance of the inner adjustable roll from the inner fixed roll required for the coating of the web of material.

<CLAIMS>
Calender in whose calender uprights (5) two outer rolls (1, 4) 
and at least two inner rolls (2, 3) disposed in the middle between 

the two outer rolls are mounted above one another offset in relation 
to one another, of which the two outer rolls are traversable by 

adjusting means (24, 26) and displaceable by further adjusting means 
(25, 27), and of which one inner roll (3) is mounted in a fixed 

position in the calender uprights (5) while the other inner roll (2) 
is displaceable by adjusting means to set the roll gap width, the 

bearing housings (6) of the displaceable inner roll being 
displaceable in slot-like guides (8) of the calender uprights and 

the adjusting means acting on the bearing housings (6) of the outer 
traversable displaceable rolls (1, 4) acting in directions at right 

angles to one another, characterised by the parallel arrangement of 
the direction of displacement of the displaceable inner roll (2) to 

the direction of displacement of the displaceable and traversable 
outer roll (1) associated with it, and by the displacement 

possibility of this outer roll going beyond the traversing 
possibility by at least the distance between the inner adjustable 

roll (2) and the inner fixed roll (3) necessary for coating the web 
of material (9, 18). 
Calender according to claim 1, characterised by a control 
device with two control possibilities for the same and preferably 

also uniform displacement of the two bearing housings (6) of the 
outer roll (1) associated with the displaceable inner roll (2): one 

possibility of displacement of one bearing housing (6) in the 
opposite direction to the displacement of the other bearing housing 

(6) by equal linear amounts and a further possibility of parallel 
displacement of both bearing housings (6) in the same direction by 

equal linear amounts. 
Calender according to claim 1, characterised in that the guides 
(23) disposed in the calender uprights (5) for the carriers (22) of 

the bearing housings (6) of the outer roll (1) which is next to-the  
 

displaceable inner roll (2) run at right angles to the guide (8) of 
the displaceable inner roll (2), in that the direction of 

displacement of this outer roll (1) for its traversing runs parallel 
to the guide (8) of the displaceable inner roll, the guides (7, 8) 

being disposed at an acute angle relative to the horizontal and the 
vertical, and in that the displacement possibility running parallel 

to the guide (8) of the inner displaceable roll (2) extends further 
than necessary for the traversing, namely also for an additional 

displacement of the roll parallel with itself, so that the distance 
between the inner adjustable roll (2) and the inner fixed roll (3) 

necessary for coating the web of material (9, 18) is adjustable. 
Calender according to claim 1 and 3, characterised in that the 
bearing housings (6) of the traversable and displaceable roll (1) 

are displaceable in slot-like guides (7) of carriers (22) which for 

their part are displaceable in slot-like guides (23) in the calender 
uprights (5), the guides (7) in the carriers (22) running at right 

angles to the guides (23) in the calender uprights (5). 
Calender according to claim 1 and 3, characterised in that the 
adjusting devices (24) acting parallel to the guide (8) for the 

bearing housings (6) of the outer roll (1) associated with the inner 
displaceable roll (2) are fixed in the calender uprights (5) and 

clamp the bearing housings (6) between them. 
Calender according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
displaceable inner roll (2) is displaceable in sloping guides and in 

one of its end positions is adjustable in a vertical plane (11) 
running through the axis of the fixed inner roll (3), while the 

other rolls (1, 4) are displaceable in sloping planes running at an 
acute angle to the vertical. 
Calender according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
calender can be used both for calendering a web-shaped product (14) 

in three roll gaps and also for doubling two webs of material and 
also for one-sided and two-sided coating or laminating of a web of 

material (9, 18) fed in and for frictioning fabrics. 
Calender according to claim 1, characterised in that in their  
 

length the control members (24) for the roll traversing are designed 
not only for the roll traversing but also beyond that for a 

displacement movement of the roll (1) parallel with itself. 
Calender according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
displacement possibility running parallel with the guide of the 

inner displaceable roll extends further than necessary for the 
traversing, namely also for an additional displacement of the roll 

parallel with itself, so that the distance between the inner 
adjustable roll and the inner fixed roll necessary for coating the 

web of material is adjustable. 
Calender according to claim 9, characterised in that provision 
is made for an additional amount of movement at the adjustable inner 

roll for opening of the roll gap in an emergency.
