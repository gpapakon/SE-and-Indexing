<CLAIMS>
A process for reacting alkyl ester chlorides of 
carboxylic acids and/or carboxylic acid dichlorides 

dissolved in corresponding dialkyl carboxylates to give 
dialkyl carboxylates, which comprises reacting this 

mixture with the corresponding alkanol at from 60 to 
300°C, with the hydrogen chloride formed remaining in the 

reaction mixture. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
reaction occurs at from 100 to 250°C. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
dialkyl carboxylates are, in particular, those of 

aromatic dicarboxylic acids. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the dialkyl carboxylates are dialkyl 

isophthalates. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
dialkyl isophthalates are diethyl isophthalates. 
A process for working up diethyl isophthalates 
used as phosgenation solvent in the preparation of tolylene 

diisocyanate and contaminated with the ethyl ester 
chloride of isophthalic acid and isophthalic acid dichloride, 

which comprises reacting this mixture at from 60 
to 300°C with ethanol, with the hydrogen chloride formed 

remaining in the reaction mixture.
