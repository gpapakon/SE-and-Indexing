<DESCRIPTION>
The invention described herein provides novel peptides and derivatives
thereof which offer potentially improved therapeutic utilities
for the treatment of neoplastic diseases as compared to
Dolastatin-10 and -15 (US Patent No 4,879,278, Nov. 7, 1989; US
Patent No 4,816,444, Mar. 28, 1989). Furthermore, unlike dolastatin-10
and -15 which must be laboriously purified from scarce
natural sources, the compounds of this invention may be conveniently
synthesized as described in detail below. In addition,
Dolastatin-10 is unstable to acid. It was described that even minor
changes in the structure can cause complete loss of activity
(Biochemical Pharmacology, vol. 40, no. 8, 1859-64, 1990).Compounds of this invention include novel peptides of the formula
I
