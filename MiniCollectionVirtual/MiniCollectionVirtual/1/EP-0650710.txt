<ABSTRACT>
A male incontinence device has one coupling part 200 
attachable to a silicone pad 500 and a second coupling part 300 

attached to a condom-like drainage member 400. A stretchable 
ring or wall 312 can be shifted ("snapped") by manual pressure 

between a locking position wherein the two coupling parts are 
locked together and an unlocking position wherein the two 

coupling parts can be separated to permit removal of the condom-like 
drainage member from the silicone pad.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a male incontinence device. Examples of known male
incontinence devices can be seen in
DE-C-674 158 and in
British Patents Nos. 669063, 1304544, 1459486, and
1521064. An early design of one of the present inventors is seen in British Patent No.
2048680.The main requirements for a satisfactory male incontinence device are that it
should he constructed to avoid leakage, be comfortable to wear, and be easy to
manipulate and to put on and take off.According to the present invention, there is provided a male incontinence
device which comprises first and second closed loop shaped coupling parts, one being for
attachment to the body of the wearer ad having a substantially flat flange for this
purpose with a penile orifice centrally located therein, the flange being connected to or
integral with an orifice-surrounding sleeve, ad the second part having a tubular member
which extends at least part-way into the sleeve, the two parts having inter-engaging
coupling structures and there being a rim which extends radially outwardly from the
tubular member, the rim being integral with a flip-over bi-stable closed loop shaped ring
connected by a plastics hinge to the radially outer portion of the rim, whereby the ring in
one of its positions serves to lock the two parts together and in the other of its positions
permits them to he separated.It is seen that there is provided a male incontinence device in which a strechable
ring or periphery of one coupling element can be shifted ("snapped") by manual presssure
between two positions, namely a locking position wherein the two coupling elements are
locked together and an unlocking position wherein the two coupling elements can be
separated to permit disassembly of the male incontinence device.In a preferred design, the first the coupling part comprises a 
flange from which extends an approximately cylindrical rib, the rib having a flexible and
deflectable seal strip located radially inwardly thereof, and the second coupling part has a
base wall attached to an approximately annular wall positioned for engagement with, and
so as to be encircled by, the seal strip on the first coupling part. The second coupling part
also has an outer wall of resilient stretchable or deflectable synthetic plastics material
which is joined to the base wall by a integral plastics hinge and which can be snapped
between two limiting positions by finger action, the wall in its first or "open" position
extending generally outwardly of the base wall and in its second or
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A male incontinence device which comprises first (200) and second (300) closed loop
shaped coupling parts, one (200) being for attachment to the b
ody of the wearer and having
a substantially flat flange (202) for this purpose with a penile orifice (206) centrally located

therein, the flange being connected to or integral with an orifice-surrounding
sleeve (204),

and the second part (300) having a tubular member (302) which extends at least part-way
into the sleeve, the two parts having inter-engaging coupling structures and there being a rim

(306) which extends radially outwardly from the tubular member (302), the rim (306) being
integral with a flip-over bi-stable closed loop shaped ring (312) connected by a plastics hinge

(310) to the radially outer portion of the rim, whereby the ring in one of its positions serves
to lock the two parts together and in the other of its positions permits them to be separated.
A male incontinence device according to claim 1 in which the first part has a
radially-inwardly directed flexible deflectible seal strip (208) arranged to make a sealing

engagement with a radially outer surface (303) of the tubular member.
A male incontinence device according to claim 1 or 2 in which the flip-over
ring is

provided with a catch (316) which in the closed position of said ring is disposed to engage an
undersurface of a rib (210) on the first part.
A male incontinence device according to any preceding claim having a pad (500) of a
soft, flexible, resilient elastomer secured to the flange of the first part, the pad having a

penile orifice (502) capable of being placed in substantial registry with the penile orifice of
the first part.
A male incontinence device according to any preceding claim in which an annular
ring (420) is provided to engage the second part in order to hold the bead (402) of a condom

(400) securely on the second part. 
A male incontinence device according to ay preceding claim, wherein the first and
second coupling parts (200, 300) are generally annular, and the flip-over

closed loop shaped
ring (312) is an annulus.
