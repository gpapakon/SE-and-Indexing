<ABSTRACT>
The Subperiosteally bone-integrated implant is made of 
titanium, is shaped as a curved "H" and comprises two surfaces: 

a) the lower or internal (1) and b) the upper or external (2). 
The lower or internal surface (1) comes into contact with the 

bone of the jaws when it is implated, it is curved, frequently 
has different curvature so that it can fit the underlying bone 

and consists of two curved horns (3) and (4), which bear a 
spike (9) and (10) in their middle and are connected to each 

other through a connective bar (5) which bears a small 
cylinder (6) in its middle. The upper or external (2) bears 

on each horn a rounded prominence (11) and (12) and the upper 
surface of the cylinder (6) bears internal thread (7) in order 

to receive the supragingival post on complation of the 
implantation. This structure is accompanied by a) a model 

of the implant (13) made of acrylic resin and b) a celluloid 
sheet (15) (TEMPLATE).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to the Subperiosteally 
bone-integrated implant, which is made of titanium, is 
shaped as a curved "H" and has been designed to solve those 
cases of implantology where the usual endosteal implant 
cannot be applied. So far, the cause which has prevented the application 
of an endosteal implant has been the fact that the area 
where the implant is to be inserted is adjacent to areas 
of vital importance in the oral cavity. As a result, there 
is no sufficient bone surface available for the unimpeded 
and without destruction of these vital anatomical features 
placement of an endosteal implant. The anatomical features of the oral cavity which are 
important during the implantation and which prevent it 
are the following: 
a) The maxillary sinus. b) The lower alveolar canal and the inferior alveolar 
nerve. c) The mental foramica. d) The nasal cavity. The present invention of the subperiosteally bone-integrated 
implant, solves definitely the problems created 
during the placement of an endosteal implant into the oral 
cavity. The subperiosteally bone-integrated implant has two surfaces: 
a) the lower or internal (1) and b) the upper or 
external (2). The lower or internal surface (1), which comes into contact 
with the bone of the jaws when it is implanted, is 
curved and frequently, of different curvature so that it 
can fit the underluing bone. It consists of two curved 
horns (3) and (4), each of which is 1cm long and both bear 
a spike (9) and (10), 1mm long, in the middle. The horns  
 
are connected to each other through a connective bar (5) 
which is also 1cm wide and bears in its middle a small 
cylinder (6), 3.5mm in diammetre and 5mm in height. The 
cylinder (6) is so placed as to protrude 1.75mm from the 
external (1) and 1.75mm from the internal surface of the 
implant. At a position exactly corresponding to the previously 
mentioned spikes (9) and (10), each one of the horns of the 
upper or external surface (2) bears a rounded prominence 
(11) and (12), 1mm high each. The upper surface of the cylinder (6) bears a socket with 
internal thread (7) which receives the supragingival post, on 
competion of the implantation. Until the placement of the 
post, the previously mentioned socket is temporarily covered 
by a simple healing screw (8) of corresponding thread. Seen in cross section, all the elements of the implant 
have hemispherical shape and the thickness of the horns and 
the bar is 1.5mm. The structure of the subperiosteally bone-integrated 
implant is also

<CLAIMS>
The subperiosteally bone-integrated implant is made of 
titanium, has two surfaces a) the lower or internal one (1) 

and b) the upper or external one (2), it is shaped as a 
curved "H" and is characterized by the fact that the lower 

or internal surface (1), which, when inserted, comes into 
contact with the bone of the jaws, it is curved and frequently 

of different curvative so that it fits the underlying bone, 
and consists of two convex horns (3) and (4), each of which 

is 1cm long and in their middle they bear a spike each, 
(9) and (10), 1mm long, which (the spikes) are used for the 

initial retention of the implant and for the prevention of 
its removal postoperatively, until the entire implant is 

covered by bone. The two horns (3) and (4) are connected 
to each other through a connective bar (5) which is 1cm 

wide and in its middle it bears a small cylinder (6), 3.5mm 
in diametre and 5mm in height, which is so placed as to 

protrude 1.75mm from the internal (1) as well as 1.75mm 
from the external surface (2) of the implant. 

The upper or external surface (2) of the subperiosteally 
bone-integrated implant bears, at each one of its horns 

and at a position exactly corresponding to the two spikes 
(9) and (10) of the internal surface (1), two rounded 

prominences (11) and (12), 1mm high each, which are used 
to keep the membrane at a distance from the bone, additionally 

assisted in this function by the cylinder (6). 
Moreover, these two prominences (11) and (12) receive the 

taps the hammer during nailing, since the damage at any 
other area of the implant must be avoided. The upper surface of the cylinder (6) bears internal 

thread (7) which receives the supragingival post on completion 
of the implantation. Until the placement of the post, 

this socket is temporarily covered by a simple healing 
screw (8) of appropriate thread. Seen in cross-section, all the elements of the implant 

have hemispherical shape and the thickness of the horns 
and the connective bar is 1.5mm 
The subperiosteally bone-integrated implant, according 
to Claim 1, is characterized by the fact that its previously 

mentioned structure is accompanied by: A) A model (13) of 
this implant which is made of acrylic resin and is used for 

design and trial of the upper or lower jaw. With this model 
(13) we test whether we created bone space is sufficient to 

receive the implant. 
Moreover, since more than one trials are necessary, we make 

use of this model (13), thus protecting the actual subperiosteally 
bone-integrated implant from any infections that 

should occure during the repeated trials. AND B) A celluloid 
sheet (15), shaped as an "H", where the outline of the 

subperiosteally bone-integrated implant has been designed 
and subsequently removed. This is used as a template for the 

initial design of the insertion of the implant. With the aid 
of this transparent membrane we trace shape "H" of the implant 

onto the bone.
