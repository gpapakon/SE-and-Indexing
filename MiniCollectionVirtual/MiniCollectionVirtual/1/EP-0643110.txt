<ABSTRACT>
A general method for the direct preparation of pigmentary quinacridone solid solutions is 
disclosed. The disclosed process comprises oxidizing a mixture of dihydroquinacridones 

directly to a pigmentary quinacridone solid solution wherein the oxidation is carried out 
by heating a reaction mixture comprising the dihydroquinacridone mixture, an alkali metal 

hydroxide, a water miscible organic solvent, water and effective amounts of an oxidizing 
agent and a particle growth inhibitor. In addition, an analogous process useful for the 

direct pigmentary synthesis of α-quinacridone is disclosed. The pigments prepared by the 
disclosed processes do not require additional particle-size reducing aftertreatments in 

order to be useful as pigments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The quinacridone family of pigments and their pigmentary properties are well known.
The pigmentary quinacridones include the parent compound, quinacridone, and various
disubstituted quinacridones.In addition, solid solution pigments of several combinations of quinacridones are known
for their improved photochemical and thermal stability. US 3,160,510, which is here
incorporated by reference, describes the phenomenon of solid solutions, their X-ray
diffraction patterns, and preparative procedures.It is well known in the pigments art that unsubstituted and substituted quinacridone pigments
can be prepared by the oxidation of the corresponding dihydroquinacridones. The
product of such an oxidation, known as a crude quinacridone, is generally unsuitable for
use as a pigment because of its large particle size. The crude pigment must be further processed
in order to develop the requisite pigmentary properties, such as particle size, particle
shape, polymorphic phase and tinctorial strength.The crude quinacridone is commonly converted to a pigmentary form by milling the crude
quinacridone with large quantities of inorganic salt and then extracting the resulting mill
powder, or by dissolving the pigment in large quantities of concentrated sulfuric acid and
drowning the solution into water (acid pasting). Since these multistep procedures generally
require a diversity of operations conducted at elevated temperatures in acidic
environments, simpler, more economical procedures for preparing pigmentary quinacridones
are highly desirable.Pigmentary quinacridone solid solutions are also generally prepared by laborious, multistep
procedures. One method involves dissolving the crude components in concentrated
sulfuric acid and then precipitating the solid solution by drowning into water under high
turbulence followed by ripening at elevated temperatures. The pigmentary solid solutions
of quinacridones have also been prepared by a variety of milling procedures. The present invention relates to the discovery that pigmentary quinacridone solid solutions
are prepared directly if mixed dihydroquinacridones, which correspond to quinacridones
capable of forming a solid solution, are simultaneously co-oxidized in the presence of a
sufficient quantity of a particle growth inhibitor to yield the pigmentary composition
directly; without the need for additional particle size reducing aftertreatments. This is surprising
because solid solutions are not formed if the oxidation is carried out in the absence
of the particle growth
