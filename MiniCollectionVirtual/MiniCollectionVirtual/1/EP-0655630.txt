<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises an essentially cylindrical magnet system (2) for 
generating a steady magnetic field (H) in a measurement space (28), a coil system (4) 

for generating gradient fields in the measurement space, ad at least one RF coil (10) 
which is arranged in the immediate vicinity of the measurement space. In order to 

increase the homogeneity of the steady magnetic field (H), approximately annular first 
elements (44) of a magnetically conductive material are provided within the magnet 

system (2) so as to extend coaxially with respect to the axis (9) of the magnet system. 
In order to minimize the amount of magnetically conductive material required, the first 

elements (44) are situated in the immediate vicinity of the RF coil (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic resonance apparatus which comprises 
an essentially cylindrical magnet system for generating a steady magnetic field in a 
measurement space, a coil system for generating gradient fields in the measurement 
space, and at least one RF coil which is arranged in the immediate vicinity of the 
measurement space, approximately annular first elements of a magnetically conductive 
material being provided coaxially with the axis of the magnet system in order to 
increase the homogeneity of the steady magnetic field within the magnet system. An apparatus of this kind is known from EP-A-0 216 404 (PHN 11.469). 
In the known apparatus the first elements are formed by rings of a ferromagnetic 
material which are arranged in recesses in the coil former for the gradient coils. A 
comparatively large amount of ferromagnetic material is required for this purpose. The 
cited document specifies that the rings should have a axial dimension of between 1 and 
10 cm and a thickness of up to 2 cm. Furthermore, adaptation of the magnetic field 
correction provided by the first elements to changing circumstances is virtually 
impossible. This becomes apparent, for example from the fact that the document states 
that a compromise must be found for magnet systems required to operate with different 
field strengths. The correction provided by the first elements, therefore, is not optimum 
for any of the field strengths used. It is a object of the invention to provide a apparatus of the kind set 
forth in which less ferromagnetic material is required and in which optimum adaptation 
of the first elements to changing circumstances is possible at least in principle. To 
achieve this, the apparatus in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the 
first elements are situated in the immediate vicinity of the RF coil. The invention is 
based on the recognition of the fact that the effect of the first elements rapidly decreases 
as the distance from these elements becomes greater. If the first elements are situated at 
the area of the coil former of the gradient coils, like in the known apparatus, their 
distance from the measurement space is comparatively large so that a large amount of 
ferromagnetic material is required to achieve the desired effect. The RF coil, however,  
 
is situated in the immediate vicinity of the object being examined. Consequently, due to 
the step in accordance with the invention the first elements are also situated in the 
immediate vicinity of the object, so
