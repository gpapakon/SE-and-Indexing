<ABSTRACT>
The sensor (1) comprises a sensor body (3) thermostatable by means of a first thermostating system (14, 15) and having an outer surface (3a, 40a) for application to the human body (28) in heat conductive relationship therewith, said outer surface (3a, 40a) forming the measuring surface of the sensor (1). The sensor (1) further comprises analyte sensing means (7, 8) arranged in said sensor body (3) and being thermostated through said body (3) by means of the first thermostating system (14, 15). The sensor (1) further comprises means (16, 41) arranged in the sensor body (3) in heat insulated relationship therewith while in heat conductive relationship with a delimited surface part of the sensor measuring surface (3a, 40a). The means (16, 41) is thermostatable by means of a second thermostating system. The delimited surface part is located within the outer periphery of the sensor measuring surface (3a, 40a). When using the sensor (1) the heat flux (34) from the measuring surface surrounding said delimited surface part provides a heat shield in the tissue, said heat shield surrounding the heat flux (35) from the delimited surface part. Thus, the heat flux (35) from the delimited surface part will be guided substantially unidirectionally to the tissue (28) located directly beneath the delimited surface part and absorbed therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a sensor for non-invasive, in 
vivo determination of an analyte and blood flow comprising 
a sensor body thermostatable by means of a 
first thermostating system and having an outer surface 
for application to the human body in heat conductive 
relationship therewith, said outer surface forming the 
measuring surface of the sensor, the sensor further 
comprising analyte sensing means arranged in said sensor 
body and being thermostated through said body by 
means of the first thermostating system, said analyte 
sensing means having a measuring surface opening into 
the sensor measuring surface, the sensor further comprising means for 
sensing blood flow by power dissipation measurement. In various situations it is advantageous to get a simultaneous 
non-invasive, in vivo determination of an 
analyte and blood flow. It is well-known in the art that transcutaneously (tc) 
measured values of the O2 content of a patients blood, 
ptcO2, do not always reflect the arterial values as the 
transcutaneous values vary dependent on the blood flow 
in the tissue located beneath the measuring site. In 
case the arterial values are to be determined from tc 
values it may thus be necessary to determine the blood 
flow beneath the measuring site as well. As the blood flow controls the amount of O2 actually 
provided to the tissue of a patient and as ptcO2 is an 
indicator of the O2 uptake in the tissue, it is possible 
through a simultaneous determination of said parameters 
to determine whether the O2 supply to the tissue 
of a patient is hemodynamically controlled, i.e. dependent 
on disturbances of the blood flow, or is respiratory 
controlled, i.e. dependent on disturbances of the 
O2 uptake in the lungs.  
 In tc measurements of blood gas parameters and blood 
flow it is necessary to measure at a temperature above 
the usual body temperature, and thus tc sensors are 
often adapted to heat the sensor and the measuring site 
to such a higher temperature. The temperature increase 
necessary for measuring blood flow is usually a little 
larger than the temperature increase necessary for 
measuring blood gases. For example, a well-established 
measurement of blood flow requires a measuring temperature 
of approx. 44° C, whereas blood gazes may be measured 
at a temperature of approx. 42° C. However, a 
temperature increase of the measuring site during a 
long time may injure the patient. Thus, the time applicable 
for measuring at one site is reduced. The relationship 
between the measuring time
