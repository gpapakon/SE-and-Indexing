<ABSTRACT>
In the optical transmission of digital signals, there is a desire to increase the transmission speed of these signals, i.e. the bit repetition rate, to, for example, 40 Gbit/s and more. In these systems, an upper limit for the bit repetition rate can be identified, above which directly modulated lasers and their electronic control systems, as currently employed, can no longer be used. An optical transmission system is indicated in whose optical transmitter (1) an electric multistage signal (V) comprising two electric digital signals (V1, V2) modulates a semiconductor laser (4), so that an optical multistage signal (V) is transmitted optically. A discriminator circuit (7), which recovers the digital signals (V1, V2), is provided in the optical receiver (2).
