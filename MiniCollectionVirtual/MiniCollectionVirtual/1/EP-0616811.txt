<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cell free T cell 
antigen receptors and their use in diagnostics and 
therapeutics. The cell free T cell antigen receptors defined 
and described herein are released from T cells lines in 
culture and in individuals with disorders or diseases that 
involve T cell responses. These released receptors differ 
from the cellular membrane bound receptor and may be used 
therapeutically or diagnostically for certain T cell 
malignancies, and other diseases or disorders which elicit or 
involve T cell responses, including some infectious diseases, 
cancers, solid tumors, autoimmune diseases, allergies etc. The invention also relates to methods for detecting 
the released T cell antigen receptor in cell culture 
supernatants, cell lysates and in human sera. The disclosures of the publications referenced within 
this application in their entirety are hereby incorporated by 
reference into this application in order to more fully 
describe the state of the art to which this invention 
pertains. The primary cells of the immune system are the small 
white blood cells, called lymphocytes, derived from stem 
cells in the bone marrow. The differentiation of one class 
of lymphocytes is completed in the thymus gland. 
Accordingly, these lymphocytes are called T cells. T cells circulate through the blood and lymphatic 
vessels of the body and are able to detect and react against 
foreign invaders, allergens, tumors and auto antigens. 
Despite their uniform morphology observed under the 
microscope, T cells consist of a heterogeneous population of 
three major subsets: the cytotoxic cells that destroy 
virus-infected cells; and two subsets, designated helper and  
 
suppressor cells, which regulate the antibody producing B 
cells. A T cell clone is a T cell from which a population of 
identical T cells is derived by clonal expansion. The 
molecular nature of the T cell antigen receptor was reported 
in the early 1980's by several research groups (Allison, et 
al., 1982, J. Immunol. 129: 2293-2300; Kappler, et al., 
1983, Cell 35: 295-302; Acuto, et al., 1983, J. Exp. Med 158: 
1368-1373. As shown in these reports the T cell antigen 
receptor is a heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of two 
glycosylated polypeptides, one of which is designated the 
alpha chain and the other of which is designated the beta 
chain. A T cell antigen receptor is normally present on the 
surface of each T cell. Each T cell recognizes a single 
antigenic determinant in association with a protein of a 
major
