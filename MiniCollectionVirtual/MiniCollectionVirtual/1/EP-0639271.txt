<ABSTRACT>
A method for predicting end-of-life of a system consumable in a fluid purification system (50) characterized by the steps of (a) coupling a model consumable (62) to the fluid purification system which has comparable characteristics but substantially less time capacity than the system consumable; (b) diverting a portion of an unpurified fluid which could otherwise flow into the system consumable into the model consumable; and (c) analyzing the model consumable to predict the end-of-life of the system consumable. Preferably, the time capacity of the model consumable to remove impurities from the fluid is a small fraction, e.g. 25 % - 50 %, of the capacity of the system consumable. A fluid purification system of the present invention is characterized by an inlet (70), an outlet (72), a system consumable (52) coupled between the inlet and the outlet, a model consumable (62) having comparable characteristics but substantially less time capacity than the system consumable, and a diverting mechanism (108) coupled between the inlet and the model consumable for diverting a portion of an unpurified fluid to model consumable. The diverting mechanism preferably includes a mass flow meter (MFM) (60) coupled in-line with the system consumable which is coupled to and controls a mass flow controller (MFC) (64) which is coupled in-line with the model consumable. The model consumable is analyzed to predict the end-of-life of the system consumable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fluid purification systems, and more
particularly to gas purification systems used to provide highly purified gasses for
use in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.Fluid purification systems are used to remove impurities from contaminated
or otherwise impure fluids. The fluids may be liquid and/or gaseous, and are
typically purified to provide a high quality fluid source for manufacturing or
consumption purposes, or to remove toxins and other contaminants prior to the
disposal of the fluid. Such systems usually include "consumables" such as filters
or getters, which must be periodically replaced.In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, gas purifiers are used to
provide the highly purified gasses used in the semiconductor manufacturing
process. For example, argon (Ar) must have less than 10 parts per billion (ppb) of
impurities if it is to be used in-state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing
equipment. Argon available from commercial gas suppliers typically has about 500
ppb of impurities, including water (H2O), oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), carbon
monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Gas purifiers are used to purify the
commercially available gas to impurity levels acceptable to the semiconductor
manufacturer.It is apparent from the above example that the terms "pure" and "impure" are
relative, not absolute, terms. For example, commercially available argon gas
having 500 ppb of impurities can hardly be considered heavily contaminated.
Therefore, as used herein, "pure" gasses will be defined as gasses which meet the
purity specifications for a given process, and "impure" gasses will be defined as
those gasses which do not meet those purity specifications.There are several methods for removing impurities from gasses such as
argon. For example, Semi-Gas of San Jose, California produces a resinous filter 
under the trademark NANOCHEM which removes impurities from gasses. While
resinous filter systems are fairly effective in removing certain impurities from
gasses, they sometimes introduce organic contaminants into the gasses being
purified.A preferred type of gas purification system for use in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry is a getter-type purification system. Getter materials
comprise certain metal alloys which have a chemical affinity for certain gasses. In
these systems, getter materials are encased in stainless steel columns and are heated
to a temperature in the range of 300 - 450 Â°C. Impurities from gasses flowing
through a getter column are
