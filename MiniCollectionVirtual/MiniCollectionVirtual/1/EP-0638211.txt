The switching unit is connected in series with the load (3) and is controlled by means of the control unit (2), most preferably so that the input of current is started when the half-cycle of the voltage acting over the switching unit starts and that the input is stopped at a desired point of the same half-cycle. The switching unit (1) according to the invention comprises a plurality of pairs of field effect transistors (5, 6; 7, 8; 9; 10, 11, 12) connected in parallel, the sources (S1, S2) of both of the field effect transistors of a pair (e.g. 5, 6) are interconnected in a way known per se, the drain (D1) of one of the field effect transistors (5) is connected to an AC source (4), and the drain (D2) of the other transistor (6) is connected to the load (3) and that the gates (G1, G2) of both of the transistors (5, 6) are connected to the control unit (2), by means of which the operation of the field effect transistors as switches is controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic 
power regulator for regulating the AC power being fed 
into a load as defined in the preamble of claim 1. The 
electronic power regulator according to the invention 
is especially suitable for regulating the power of one 
or more light sources, but it can as well be used for 
regulating the power of other kinds of loads, such as 
resistive and/or capacitative loads. A power regulator for a light source, comprising 
a switching unit arranged in series with the load 
and accomplished by means of a diode bridge and a 
field-effect transistor operating as a switch, is previously 
known. During the positive and negative half-cycle 
the input current traverses alternatingly the two 
opposing diodes and the field-effect transistor, the 
direction of the current always being the same in the 
transistor. The drawback, nevertheless, is that as the 
diodes of the diode bridge are fixed components, they 
will cause power losses in the switching unit. Finnish patent publication FI 61781 discloses 
a switching element consisting of two switches comprising 
transistors, the collectors of which are interconnected. 
Two reverse-connected diodes have been connected 
parallel to each of the transistors, the direction 
of the diodes being from the emitter to the collector 
of the parallel transistor. The input current traverses, 
depending on the half-cycle, always one diode and 
one collector-emitter connection. Thereby one of the 
diodes always forms a constant power loss, which causes 
additional power losses in the power regulator. These 
power losses increase greatly as the current increases. 
It should additionally be noted that this connecting 
element is not used in the power regulator by itself, 
but the publication requires that a comparable connecting 
element be connected also in parallel with the  
 
load. This is especially so when the load is an inductive 
or capacitative one. US-A-5,038,081 discloses an electronic power 
regulator, the switching unit of which comprises a pair 
of field effect transistors. The power regulator circuit 
is specially intended for use with loads including 
capacitative loads, especially low voltage incandescent 
light bulbs. With this power regulator, the flow of 
current is started at the starting point of the half-cycle 
of the AC voltage, and is terminated at a desired 
point of the same half-cycle. The advantage of this 
power regulator is that its power consumption is smaller 
than that of the other known solutions. A
