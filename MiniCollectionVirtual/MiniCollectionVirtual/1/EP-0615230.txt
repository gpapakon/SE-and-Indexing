<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic head which is 
rotatable through 180° between two extreme positions, is connected 

to a component (23) in 
the magnetic-tape apparatus (1) 
via
 a foil (21) provided with 
electrical conductor tracks. 

The foil (21) is wrapped partly around a spindle (35) and has a 
first end (47) connected 

to the magnetic head (19). A part of the foil (21) forms a loop (51) 
situated in a recess (53) 

formed in the spindle (35). The recess (53) extends over a part 
of the circumference 

(55) of the spindle (35) and in a tangential direction it is 
bounded by two walls (59,61) 

having such arcuate shapes viewed in a radial direction of the 
spindle that the loop (51) 

lies against one of the arcuate walls (59,61) in the extreme 
positions of the magnetic head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic-tape apparatus including a magnetic-head 
unit comprising a magnetic head rotatable between two positions, and a elongate 
foil wrapped partly around a spindle and provided with electrical conductor trace for 
the signal transmission between the magnetic head and a component of the magnetic-tape 
apparatus, which foil has a first end connected to the magnetic head and a second 
end to the component. A magnetic-tape apparatus of the type defined in the opening paragraph is 
commercially available as a Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) magnetic-tape apparatus. 
The known magnetic-tape apparatus has a magnetic head provided with transducing gaps 
for reading and writing information from/on a magnetic tape. Each of these transducing 
gaps is situated in a magnetic circuit with a transducing element. In operation the 
transducing elements are driven individually. In order to avoid a tangle of connection 
wires required for this purpose the connection wires take the form of electrical 
conductor tracks arranged on a foil. In the known magnetic-tape apparatuses magnetic 
tape transport is possible in two opposite directions. In auto-reverse magnetic-tape 
apparatuses the magnetic head may be rotatable through 180° between two extreme 
positions. In order to allow a rotation through a angle of 180° the foil is coiled into a 
number of turns, the foil being wound up or unwound during rotation of the magnetic 
head. A disadvantage of the gown magnetic-tape apparatus is that in one of the 
extreme positions of the magnetic head, in which the foil has been unwound partly, the 
remaining coil of foil has a comparatively large diameter and consequently requires a 
substantial mounting space. It is object of the invention to provide a magnetic-tape apparatus of the 
type defined in the opening paragraph, whose magnetic-head unit requires less mounting 
space. To this end the magnetic-tape apparatus in accordance with the invention is 
characterized in that a part of the foil between the two ends forms a loop situated at  
 
least for the greater part in a recess formed in the spindle, which recess extends over a 
part of the circumference of the spindle. Since the foil is not coiled but formed into a 
loop which extends in a recess in the spindle and is slackened in this recess when the 
magnetic head is rotated the foil occupies hardly any more space than the spindle itself, 
so that only a limited mounting space is needed. DE 35 37 783 A1 (herewith incorporated by reference)
