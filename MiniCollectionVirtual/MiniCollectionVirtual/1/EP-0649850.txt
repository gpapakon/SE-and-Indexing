<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
preparing isocyanatoorganosilanes and to certain
isocyanatoorganosilanes so prepared.There has been a continuing need for a method of
preparing isocyanatoorganosilanes, including isocyanatoalkylsilanes,
in high yields and purities from economical
and relatively non-hazardous raw materials without
generating significant quantities of hazardous by-products
and waste materials. Heretofore, isocyanato-organosilanes
have been made in relatively low volumes by
inefficient or costly processes.For example, isocyanatoorganosilanes have been
prepared by processes involving addition of hydrosilanes
to unsaturated isocyanates, particularly allyl
isocyanate, in the presence of a noble metal catalyst.
Allyl isocyanate is a highly toxic raw material of
limited commercial availability.Processes are also known in the art wherein
isocyanatoalkylsilanes are prepared from carbamato-alkylsilanes
at a low temperature in the liquid phase, or
from aminoalkylsilanes and highly toxic phosgene by
various routes. All liquid phase processes disclosed 
thus far suffer from one or more disadvantages of low
yield, slow kinetics, need for highly toxic raw
materials, need for extensive work-up or purification
often in the presence of higher levels of close-boiling
contaminants, and substantial generation of by-products
and waste materials.A method for making 2-isocyanatoethoxysilanes by
liquid phase thermal rearrangement of N-silyl-2-oxazolidinones
has also been disclosed. The bonding of
the isocyanatoalkyl group to silicon atoms in these
molecules is through a hydrolyzable silicon-oxygen bond,
and the silane moiety does not contain additional alkoxy
groups as are present and often necessary in current
commercially useful isocyanatoalkylsilanes.The present invention surprisingly provides a method
wherein isocyanatoorganosilanes are provided in high
yields and purities with no need to use highly toxic
phosgene or highly toxic allyl isocyanate, with no
generation of highly corrosive hydrogen chloride as a by-product,
with no need to use inert solvents as diluents,
and with minimal formation of by-products, contaminants,
and waste materials. Because the method of the present
invention can be operated continuously with very short
residence times, a relatively small reactor is capable of
large throughputs with a correspondingly small capital
investment. The method of the present invention can also provide
isocyanatoorganosilanes which have not been prepared by
methods known to those skilled in the
