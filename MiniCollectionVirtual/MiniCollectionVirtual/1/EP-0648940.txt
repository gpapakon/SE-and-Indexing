<ABSTRACT>
A multiple subbase for the distribution of 
pressurised air to pneumatic valves. The subbase 

comprises a hollow body (11) having an upper surface 
for assembling pneumatic valves (13), the subbase 

being provided with a central duct (14) having outlet 
parts (15) opening towards the upper surface (11) of 

the subbase for supplying pressurised air to the 
pnematic valves (13), and large lateral exhaust ducts 

(16, 17) comprising chambers (16', 17') for housing 
noise dampening filter means (36, 37) positioned near 

the exhaust ports (34, 35) for the pneumatic valves 
(13) on the subbase. The subbase can be made in a 

single extruded block or may consist of a plurality 
of modular elements obtained from a same extruded 

section which is cut to the required sizes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiple subbase,
for the distribution of compressed air to a set of
pneumatic valves according to the preamble of claim 1 and known from EP-A-0 389 777, which may be obtained by simple
machining operations from an extruded section bar in
aluminium or another material suitable for its
construction and use. More particularly the invention
is aimed at a multiple subbase which can be made from
an extruded section bar both in the form of a single
block and component elements, obtained by simple
cutting operations from a same section bar.Multiple subbases made both by casting and from an
extruded section bar, in a single block or in modular
sections which can be variously assembled one to the
other, are generally known and commercially
available.In general, known subbases have a solid structure
body in which tubular ducts are formed for supplying
and discharging pressurised air respectively, as well
as the necessary passages for connection to the 
individual electropneumatic valves which are
assembled on each occasion on the subbase.When traditional subbases are used in
electropneumatic subsystems for supplying and
distributing compressed air to equipments or to
peripheral delivery points, there is the serious
problem of noise from the exhausts of the various
electropneumatic valves which cause a considerable
noise pollution in the work place. The use of exhaust
ducts with relatively small flow passage sections and
the impossibility of adopting suitable noise reducing
systems in traditional subbases, often accompany the
risk of clogging of the ducts and malfunctioning of
the subbase and of the pneumatic valves related
thereto.The main object of the present invention is therefore
to provide a subbase for electropneumatic valves
which is suitable for reducing the problems of noise
pollution in traditional subbases.A further object of the present invention is to
provide a subbase of the kind mentioned above, which
is economical to manufacture and relatively low in 
weight, as well as provided with large air exhaust
ducts, without thereby increasing the overall
dimensions of the subbase itself.Yet a further object of the invention is to provide a
multiple subbase as referred above, which can be made
in one block or in modular component elements from a
same extruded section bar.The objects referred above can be achieved by means
of a multiple subbase having the features of the
claim 1.An embodiment of a multiple subbase according to the
invention and further features of the
