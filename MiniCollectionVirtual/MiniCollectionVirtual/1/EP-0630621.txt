<ABSTRACT>
Anatomical restoration dental implant system having 
an interlockable various shaped healing cap assembly and a matching 

abutment member (206). 
The healing cap assembly includes an integral bolt member (202) 

which has a widened head segment (210) 
and an elongated shaft segment (228). The healing 

cap assembly also includes a healing cap member (204) 
which has a divergent body 

with a larger rounded triangle shaped end (244). 
The healing cap member (204) also has a 

stepped interior bore (250) with 
threaded section offset (254) from that of the bolt member 

so that the healing cap member and the bolt member are interlockable. The 
present invention also comprises a matching abutment member (206) 

for supporting a 
tooth (302) analogue with a rounded triangle shaped root. 

The abutment member has a 
bolt segment (270) 

which is identical to the bolt member of the healing cap assembly, 
and a frusto-conical shaped head segment (280). 

The large end (282) of the frusto-conical 
shaped head segment of the abutment member is circular shaped and smaller 

than the rounded triangle shaped end (244) 
of the healing cap member, such that when 

the abutment member is attached to the healing cap member, a rounded triangle 
shaped shoulder (300) 

is created for matching perfectly with the rounded triangle 
shaped root of the tooth analogue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of dental implants and
in particular to a system providing a tooth analogue and a gingival tissue healing
cap which results in a restoration having tissue-implant profiles similar to that of
a natural tooth and its surrounding gingiva. The present invention also relates
to fitting a tooth with a temporary crown and final prosthesis after the initial
implant structure has been inserted and the surrounding tissue has healed. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to the field of anatomical
restoration dental implant systems with interlockable various shaped healing cap
and abutment.Many systems have been proposed for rigidly fixing metal or ceramic
materials to the alveolus of a human mandible or maxilla in an effort to provide
a long term replacement for lost teeth. Early systems were successful for only
limited periods of time and were eventually rejected as foreign bodies. Later
systems, as described by U.S. Patents Nos. 3,589,011 to Sneer, 3,797,113 to
Brainin, 3,979,828 to Taylor, 4,324,550 to Reuther et al., and 4,416,679 to
Mozsary et al., have proven to offer long term success by providing rigid
anchorage in the supporting bone. Intraoral restoration of such ossointegrated
devices has been accomplished with many different systems that modified the
original attempts. Such modifications have been described in U.S. Patents Nos.
4,780,080 to Harras, 4,713,003 to Symington et al., and 4,657,510 to Gittlemen.
However, these restorative systems have required biologic and aesthetic
compromises. The interface between an implant and its surrounding gingival
tissue is often insufficiently close to prevent food and bacteria from entering this
area. Such foreign matter can cause chronic infection and bone loss, resulting in
eventual loss of the implant. Implants in current use have a round root form 
dimensionally different from that of a normal tooth root morphology. This
makes aesthetic restoration difficult and impedes the development of a natural
soft gingival tissue contour.The inventor and applicant of the present invention has been practicing
anatomical restoration dental implant surgeries for many years and is the
patentee of a series U.S. Patents related to anatomical restoration dental
implant systems. United States Patent No. 5,073,111 issued to Daftary on
December 17, 1991 (hereafter "the '111 Patent") disclosed an anatomical
restoration dental implant system. Shown in Figures 1 and 2, the '111 Patent
disclosed an anatomical
