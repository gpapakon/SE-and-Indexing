<ABSTRACT>
A soft gelatine capsule comprises a shell 
containing a filling with a high water content. The 

filling includes at least one constituent in the 
form of colloidal silica or silicon dioxide, which 

has the effect of fixing the water in the filling, 
and preventing its migration to the shell and 

consequential breakdown of the shell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soft gelatine 
capsules for use in the field of predosed forms for 
pharmaceutical, veterinary, dietetic, food, cosmetic 
or other products. The use of soft capsules in predosed forms for 
pharmaceutical, veterinary, dietetic, food, cosmetic 
or other purposes has been known for many years and 
is currently very widespread. These soft capsules 
are generally manufactured either according to a so-called 
drop process or according to one known as the 
rotary die process using rotating moulds. This 
process is described in the September 1985 edition 
of Pharmaceutical Technology, to which reference is 
directed. A known rotary die process consists of forming 
endless strips of capsule shell material from a 
molten mass which is of viscous consistency and has 
a gelatine base, this mass being maintained at a 
temperature of approximately 700Â°C. The thickness 
of the gelatine strip can of course be selected 
according to the eventual use of the capsule. The 
gelatine mass comprises the gelatine itself, 
glycerine and water in varying proportions depending 
on the eventual use and the formulations to be 
encapsulated. Typical proportions are approximately 
the following: 40%, 30% and 30% of gelatine, 
glycerine and water respectively. The molten mass 
may be provided with additives. The gelatine strips are guided between two 
moulds rotating in opposite directions, between 
which a device is inserted for injection of the 
product to be encapsulated, commonly known as a 
segment. The two moulds between which the capsules 
are formed each have cavities in the shape of a 
capsule half.  When the edges of the two opposite cells join 
together by the rotation of the moulds, the capsule 
filling, which normally consists of a mixture of 
various ingredients, is injected between the two 
films of gelatine by means of the injection segment 
which is fed by pumps with a very accurate delivery, 
thereby giving each capsule its appropriate volume 
of filling. During this operation, the injection 
segment is heated slightly such that the surfaces of 
the gelatine films become softened, which allows the 
two halves of the capsule to be formed and weld 
together. The contents of the capsule are not 
affected by the heating. After they have been filled, the capsules are 
ejected from the cylinder by a series of ejectors 
fitted in the cavities, and are then conveyed to a 
pre-drying system. In a succession of drying 
phases, the capsules are hardened until they have a 
final water content in
