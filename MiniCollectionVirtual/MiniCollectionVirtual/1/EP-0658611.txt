<ABSTRACT>
Piston rod guide (9) and shock-absorber piston (6) having a basic body (12, 15) of sintered metal with guiding, sliding and sealing elements (11, 14) which are applied directly to the zones of the sintered metal basic bodies (12, 15) which carry these elements (11, 14) by injection moulding. The injection moulding composition comprises a polymer which contains a mineral filler which in turn has slide properties, which polymer is selected from the group consisting of fluoropolymers, polyphenylene sulphide, polyaryl ether ketones and phenol-formaldehyde resin.

A sintered metal moulding for shock absorbers (1),
namely a piston rod guide (9) and a piston ((6) which may

be mounted fixedly on a piston rod (5) movable in the
direction of the longitudinal axis, may be moved in a

cylindrical tube (2) and is sealed with respect to the
wall of the cylindrical, tube (2), said piston rod guide

(9) and said piston (6) being provided, at their zones

carrying out the guiding and sealing functions, with
guiding, sealing and sliding elements (11, 14) in the

form of coatings (11, 14) consisting of organic polymers
or containing organic polymers, characterised in that at

least the zones of the piston rod guide (9) and the
shock-absorber piston (6) carrying out the guiding and

sealing functions are provided with raised areas (16,
25) and recessed areas (18, 24, 26) and are encapsulated

by injection molding in a sealing, guiding and sliding
coating (11, 14) of an organic polymer, wherein the

coating (11, 14) is anchored firmly and conformedly in
the zone and the organic polymer is a thermoplastic or

thermosetting plastic containing a mineral filler
providing surface slip characteristics.
A sintered metal moulding for shock absorbers (1)
according to claim 1, characterised in that the

injection-moulded coatings (11, 14) of the piston rod
guide (9) and the shock-absorber piston (6) contain a

fluorine-containing thermoplastic from the group
comprising


copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene with
perfluoroalkylvinyl ether (PPA), 
copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene with
perfluorinated propylene and perfluoroalkylvinyl

ether (EPE),
