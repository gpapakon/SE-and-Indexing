<ABSTRACT>
The identification device has at least one peripheral aperture (2) which can be slid on each arm of a chain element. The open width (w) of the aperture is equal to the actual dia. of the arm which is reduced wrt. the characteristic dia. by a wear component. The identification device may include two protrusions forming a yoke whose outward facing sides are at a defined distance from each other which corresp. to the pitch of the chain elements.

<CLAIMS>
Marking label, having details which comply with the standards, 
for chains made of round links, characterized in 

that said label has on its circumference at least one 

cutout (2;4) which can be pushed over in each case one 
limb of the links of the chain and whose unobstructed 

width (W) is equal to that actual diameter (d
A
) of the limb 
which corresponds to the need for replacement and is reduced 

by a wear element from the nominal diameter (d
0
). 
Marking label according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
said label is provided with a plurality of cutouts (4) 

which are assigned to the links of chains of different 
size. 
Marking label according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that said label is provided with at least two projections 

(6,7) which form a fork and whose mutually averted outer 
sides are at a distance (A) from one another which is 

equal to that pitch (t
A
) of the chain links which corresponds 
to the need for replacement. 
Marking label according to Claim 1 to 2, charcterized in 
that said label has a projection (10;19) which can be inserted 

between the ends (11,12) of two chain links (14,15) 
which are attached to a chain link (13), the side surfaces 

of which projection (10;19) which come into contact with 
the ends (11,12) are at a distance (A) from one another in 

the region of the apex points of the ends (11,12), which 
distance (A) is equal to the pitch (t
A
) of the links of the  
 

chain corresponding to the need for replacement reduced by 
twice the nominal diameter (d
0
) of the links of the chain. 
Marking label according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
those side surfaces of the projection (10) which can be 

brought into contact with the ends (11,12) of the chain 
links (14,15) run parallel to the mutually opposite outer 

surfaces of the label. 
Marking label according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
those side surfaces of the projection (19) which can be 

brought into contact with the ends (11,12) of the chain 
links (14,15) run at right angles to the outer surfaces of 

the label. 
Marking label according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
said label has an essentially trapezoidal section (18) 

beyond whose short base line (17) the projection (19) 
protrudes.
