<ABSTRACT>
An ankle brace (20) is disclosed having an upper portion (21) and a foot section (22). Anchor sites (41, 42) are located on the upper section and elastic connections (24, 25, 30) extend between the upper portion (21) and the foot section (22) and limit the degree of movement of the ankle.

 TITLE"AN ANKLE BRACE" FIELD OF THE INVENTION THIS INVENTION relates to an improved ankle brace.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn particular the invention relates to an improved brace for externally supporting and protecting the human ankle and subtalar joints from injury or re- injured during recreational pursuits or in correction or rehabilitation of pathological or congenital malalignments and injury. The invention also relates to improvements in a reusable external prophylactic support or brace for the human ankle joint. A number of techniques and devices have been proposed by which ankle injury might be minimised or prevented. Before these techniques and devices can be discussed it is useful in first discussing the anatomy of the ankle. The ankle and foot complex consists of twenty- eight bones including the tibia and fibula. This specification will deal primarily with the six bones which comprise the ankle, subtalar, and transverse tarsal joints. The complex interactions between bones, ligaments, tendons and their musculature enable the foot to transfer from a mobile adaptor during ground interface to a rigid lever for propulsion. The body requires a flexible foot to accommodate the variations in the external environment, a semi-rigid foot that can act as a spring or lever arm for push off during gait and a rigid foot to enable body weight to be carried with adequate stability. The position of the subtalar joint is the major factor in this adaptation. Eversion of the calcaneus results in pronation of the subtalar joint which in turn "unlocks" the transverse tarsal joint - whilst inversion leads to supination of the subtalar 

joint which in turn "locks" the transverse tarsal joint creating a rigid forefoot. A thorough understanding of the interrelation between joint axes and planes of motion is essential to analysis of compensatory motion as a consequence of pathological or restricted motion.The bones of the foot interlock to form three distinct arches. The medial and lateral longitudinal arches and the transverse arch. The formation of these arches allows the support of body weight with the least expenditure of anatomical material and provides protection of the nerves and vasculature of the plantar foot. The bones of the medial arch are passively interlocked by the plantar aponeurosis, the long and short plantar ligaments, and the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament. During weight bearing, and heel raise, tension is increased especially in the plantar aponeurosis as the metatarsophalangeal

CLAIMS :
1. An ankle brace having an upper portion adapted to extend about a wearer's ankle adjacent the malleoli, the upper portion having at least one anchor site, a foot section conforming to a portion of the sole of the wearer's foot and at least one elastic lateral connection extending between the foot section and the upper portion enabling normal range of movement of the ankle and becoming increasingly taut at about the limit of the normal or a preset range of movement.
2. The brace of Claim 1 including at least one elastic medial connection between the foot section and the upper portion of the brace which enables normal range of movement of the ankle and becomes increasingly taut at about the limit of the normal or a preset range of movement.
3. The brace of Claim 1 including two said lateral connections.
4. The brace of Claim 2 or 3 including a medial anchor site and a lateral anchor site on the upper portion of the brace.
5. The brace of Claim 4 including an adjustable inversion limiting connection extending from the foot section from an anterior lateral position adjacent the cuboid of the foot across the outside of the ankle joint to the medial anchor site.
6. The brace of Claim 1 wherein the foot section includes a foot insert moldable to conform to the contour of the wearer's foot. 7. The brace of Claim 6 wherein the foot insert has a reduced width at its lateral border and of increased width across the instep to beneath the medial malleolus and more anteriorly to a location approximately over the talo-navicular joint. 8. The brace of Claim 6 including a comfort lining extending over the foot insert. 9. The brace of Claim 1 wherein the upper portion 


completely encircles the foot.
10. The brace of Claim 9 wherein either a posterior or anterior portion of the upper portion is elastic to enable the wearer's foot to be inserted into the brace. 11. The brace of Claim 9 wherein either an anterior or posterior portion of the upper portion of the brace is open and at least one adjustable connection is present to close the opening once the foot is inserted.
12. The brace of Claim 11 wherein the upper portion is open both anteriorly and posteriorly and two said adjustable connections close off both the anterior and posterior portions of the upper portions of the brace.
13. The brace of Claim 1 or 2 wherein the elastic medial and lateral connections are straps and have fixotropic characteristics.
14. The brace of Claim 4 including adjustable talar stabilising connections including a medial and a lateral talar stabilising connection, the talar stabilising connections extend from a posterior portion of the foot section, cross over each other in the region of the Achilles tendon and to opposite superior sides of the brace and terminate at the medial and the lateral anchor sites.
15. The brace of Claim 14 wherein the talar stabilising connections are straps having elastic characteristics.
16. The brace of Claim 14 wherein the talar stabilising connections are of adjustable length.
17. The brace of Claim 4 wherein the anchor sites are located above each malleoli.
18. The brace of Claim 17 wherein the anchor sites are located below the inferior of the triceps surae.
19. The brace of Claim 4 wherein the anchor sites include a pad in contact with the foot and having suction pads.
20. The brace of Claim 4 wherein the anchor sites include a pad made of synthetic material which conforms 


to the contour of the foot.
21. The brace of Claim 5 including an inversion limiting connection extending from the cuboid to the lateral anchor site.
