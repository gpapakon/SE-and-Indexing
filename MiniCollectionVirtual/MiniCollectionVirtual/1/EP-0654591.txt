<ABSTRACT>
The installation has a separating chamber (3), turbochargers (15, 17) for inspiring and compressing air from the environment, an exhaust gas-air heat exchanger (4, 5) for heating the inspired air by means of the exhaust gases from the combustion chamber and a practical turbine (19) with connected generator, by means of which the heat energy of the heated air is converted into mechanical or electrical energy. To increase the efficiency, two turbochargers (15, 17) connected in series are provided, between which a water atomiser (11) and/or a heat exchanger (6) are provided. Furthermore, both upstream of the practical turbine (19) and also upstream of the compressors of the turbochargers (15, 17), provision can be made for oil or gas flue burners (16, 16', 16''). Various connections of the turbochargers (15, 17) and of the practical turbine (19) are described.

Apparatus for obtaining electrical energy from fuels,
in particular from biogenic fuels, with a combustion chamber

(3), means for drawing in and compressing air from the
environment and an operating turbine (19) with connected

generator, wherein the means for drawing in and compressing
air comprise at least two series-connected compressors

between which are provided a water atomiser (11) and/or a
heat exchanger (6) and wherein the compressors each form

part of a turbocharger (15, 17), characterised in that the
apparatus comprises a first (5) and a second (4) flue

gas-air heat exchanger (4, 5) which are in each case
spatially separated from the combustion chamber (3), wherein

in both flue gas-air heat exchangers (5, 4) the air drawn in
by the compressors is heated by the flue gas produced in the

combustion chamber (3), in that the operating turbine (19)
and the turbines of the turbochargers (15, 17) can be driven

by the heated air, in that in the first flue gas-air heat
exchanger (5) the direction of flow of the air is opposite

the direction of flow of the flue gas, whereas in the second
flue gas-air heat exchanger (4) the direction of flow of the

air and the direction of flow of the flue gas are the same,
in that the first flue gas-air heat exchanger (5), seen in

the direction of flow of the air, is located downstream of
