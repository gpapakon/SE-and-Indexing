<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor laser 
element substrate and a method for producing a semiconductor 
laser device, and more particularly, to a semiconductor 
laser element substrate that includes element separation 
guiding grooves and a method for producing a semiconductor 
laser device using this semiconductor laser element 
substrate. Figure 7 is a perspective view of a prior art 
semiconductor laser having element separation guiding 
grooves viewed from the bottom surface side, and figures 
8(a) to 8(e) are perspective views illustrating process 
steps for a production method thereof. In the figures, reference numeral 1 designates a 
semiconductor laser substrate of about 3 cm x 3 cm on which 
a plurality of semiconductor lasers each having the area of 
about 300 µm x 300 µm are produced in an array comprising a 
plurality of rows and a plurality of columns on an n-type 
GaAs substrate to which front surface process is completed. 
Reference numeral 2 designates a glass plate for adhering to 
the semiconductor substrate 1 for fixation. Reference 
numeral 3 designates wax for enabling the adhesion.  
 
Reference numeral 4 designates a photoresist which becomes 
an etching mask. Reference numeral 5 designates an element 
separation guiding groove for separating the plural 
semiconductor lasers in an array. Reference numeral 6 
designates gold plated on a rear surface of each 
semiconductor laser, which becomes an electrode. Reference 
numeral 7 designates a blade for separating elements. A laser resonator in a semiconductor laser is 
conventionally produced utilizing cleavage facet of a 
crystal. To realize this, the substrate 1 is scrubbed as 
thin as 100 µm so that cleavage of the crystal is smoothly 
carried out. After producing the laser resonator by 
cleavage, the wafer is divided into respective elements. In 
order to facilitate this element separation, a method of 
providing element separation guiding grooves on the 
substrate is often employed. A description will be given of a flow for producing 
element separation guiding grooves for semiconductor lasers 
produced on the n-type GaAs substrate with reference to 
figures 8(a) to 8(e). First, the semiconductor laser substrate 1 to which 
front surface process is completed is attached to the glass 
plate 2 by wax 3 with placing the front surface of the 
substrate downward. A material having almost the same 
thermal expansion coefficient as the substrate 1 is employed  
 
as the glass plate 2, and a material which is melted at 
arou
