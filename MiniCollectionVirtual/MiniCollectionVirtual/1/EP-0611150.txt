<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for powder spraying a automotive 
or other vehicle body (19) in a powder spray booth (11) includes a cabin 

purge zone (45) in which a pair of inlet hood assemblies (46,47) are 
positioned to the side window openings on each side of the 

body (19) and the cavity is purged of excess powder by extracting 
the powder from the cavity through the inlet hood assemblies (46,47). 

The effective and efficient removal of suspended oversprayed 
powder from the interior of the vehicle cabin is accomplished 

through the production of a symmetrical air flow through the 
vehicle cabin in which air is exhausted through the two side 

window openings while the interior of the vehicle cabin is 
replenished with air through the front windshield opening and 

the rear window opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to powder coating systems, and 
more particularly, to systems for spraying powder coating 
material onto objects such as automotive or other vehicle 
bodies. The spraying of solid particulate materials for coating 
automotive and other vehicle bodies has been used for a number 
of years, see e.g. US-A-5 095 811. The spraying can be accomplished using electrostatic 
spraying techniques in a spray booth which includes an 
elongated tunnel-like construction having an inlet for the 
ingress of the vehicle body, a coating application area, a 
curing or drying area in some designs, and an outlet for the 
egress of the vehicle body. Conditioned air is introduced in 
the spray booth by an air feed blower into a plenum chamber 
at the top of the booth and is directed downwardly toward the 
vehicle body moving through the booth. This flow of conditioned 
air picks up oversprayed powder coating material, i.e., 
material which does not adhere to the vehicle body, and is 
then drawn downwardly through the sides and/or floor of the 
booth by one of more air exhaust fans. Filters are provided 
to remove the particulate powder material from the air, and 
the resulting filtered or clean air is withdrawn from the 
booth for expulsion to atmosphere or for recirculation to the 
conditioned air supply while the recovered powder material is 
sent to a recovery system for classification and re-use. This air flow system is generally effective in removing 
oversprayed powder from the booth. However, in the spraying  
 
of vehicle car bodies, the inside or cabin of the vehicle body 
can be partially isolated from this air flow, and much of the 
oversprayed powder in the vehicle cabin may not be 
significantly affected by this air flow system. As a result, 
oversprayed powder can remain aloft within the vehicle cabin 
for an extended period of time. When the powder in the vehicle 
cabin remains aloft after the vehicle body has left the spray 
zone, the suspended overspray may be conveyed into subsequent 
zones in the spray booth. This, in turn, can lead to 
contaminated downline processes or process equipment. In accordance with the invention, a method of powder spraying 
a workpiece having openings on opposing sides thereof and a 
hollow interior cavity connected to the opening comprises the 
steps of spraying powder on the exterior of the workpiece, 
positioning a pair of inlet hood assemblies to the openings on 
each side of the workpiece, connecting the pair of inlet hood 
assemblies to a vacuum source,

<CLAIMS>
A method of powder spraying a workpiece having 
side openings on opposing sides thereof and at least one 

additional opening and a hollow interior cavity connected 
to the openings, the method comprising the steps of 

spraying powder on the exterior of the workpiece, 
positioning a pair of inlet hood assemblies to the 

openings on each side of the workpiece, connecting the 
pair of inlet hood assemblies to a vacuum source, and 

operating the vacuum source so as to purge the cavity of 
excess powder by extracting the powder from the cavity 

through the inlet hood assemblies whilst allowing 
replenishing air to enter the interior cavity through the 

additional opening(s). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the 
workpiece is symmetrical about its 
longitudinal axis and 
the side openings are symmetrically located on each side 

of the workpiece, and wherein the purging step is 
accomplished by symmetrically extracting powder from the 

interior using the inlet hood assemblies on both sides. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
workpiece has additional openings in the front and back 

along the axis of symetry, and wherein the purging step 
includes allowing replenishing air to enter the interior 

substantially exclusively through the additional 
openings. 
A method according to any preceding claim wherein 
the workpiece is an automobile vehicle body. 
A method of powder spraying a vehicle body having 
two opposed side window openings, a front windshield 

opening, a rear window opening, and an interior cabin, 
the method comprising the steps of spraying powder on the 

exterior of the vehicle body, positioning inlet hood  
 

assemblies at both of the side window openings, 
connecting both the inlet hood assemblies to a vacuum 

source, and operating the vacuum so as to purge the cabin 
of excess powder by extracting the powder from the cabin 

through the inlet hood assemblies while allowing make-up 
air to enter the cabin through the windshield opening and 

the rear window opening. 
A method according to claim 5, wherein the 
purging step is performed while allowing make-up air to 

enter the cabin substantially exclusively through the 
windshield and rear window openings. 
A method according to any preceding claim wherein 
the spraying and purging steps are performed in a powder 

spray booth, comprising the additional step of providing 
a transition zone at the outlet of the booth to prevent 

pulling of powder overspray out of the booth. 
A method according to claim 7, wherein the 
connecting and purging steps are performed in a cabin 

purge zone, and wherein the cabin purge zone is the 
transition zone. 
Apparatus for powder spraying a body having two 
opposed side openings, at least one additional opening 

and an interior cavity, the apparatus comprising means 
for spraying powder on the exterior of body, inlet hood 

assemblies for engaging both of the openings, a vacuum 
source connected to both the inlet hood assemblies for 

purging the cavity of excess powder by extracting the 
powder from the cavity through the inlet hood assemblies 

while allowing make-up air to enter the cavity through 
the additional opening(s).
