<ABSTRACT>
A tension unit for a control cable (5) of a bicycle brake including 
a connecting element (7) for engaging the control cable (5) to 

be movable along the control cable, a tension 
element (9) for interconnecting 

a brake caliper (2) and the connecting element, and a supporter (8) 
disposed between the connecting element and another brake caliper (1) 

for maintaining a predetermined distance between the connecting element 
and a point at which the brake caliper engages the control cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tension unit for a control
cable of a bicycle brake, and more particularly to a tension
unit for a control cable of a center-pull type caliper brake.In a conventional construction of a center-pull type caliper
brake, as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication Kokai
No. 1991-64193, for example, a pair of brake calipers having
brake shoes are pivotably supported independently of
each other by a bicycle frame. In this example, one end of a
yoke cable is connected to one of the brake calipers, while
the other end of the cable is connected to the other brake
caliper. Further, this yoke cable, at or adjacent a middle
position thereof, is relatively movably engaged through a
connecting element with a control cable connected to a brake
lever. According to this construction, the connecting element must
be in a middle position transversely of a bicycle in order
for the pair of brake shoes to take braking action simultaneously.
If the connecting element is even slightly displaced
from the middle position fo the yoke cable, the two brake
shoes do not contact a wheel rim simultaneously. In this
case, one of the brake shoes applies a greater braking force
than the other. Thus, this prior construction leaves room for
improvement.A development of the above construction is disclosed in Japanese
Utility Model publication Kokai No. 1987-187990. In
this example, a control cable extends from a brake lever to
one of brake calipers, and a connecting element is provided
to be slidable along the control cable. The other brake caliper
is connected to the connecting element through a connecting
cable. This construction is capable of equalizing a distance
from the connecting element to one of the calipers and
a distance from the connecting element to the other caliper
with ease.According to this construction, however, the control cable is
curved in the region of the connecting element to extend toward
one of the calipers. Thus, a tension acts toward one of
the calipers, thereby tending to move the connecting element
in that direction. As a result, right and left braking forces
are not applied simultaneously, impairing an optimal braking
result.An object of the present invention is to provide a tension
unit for a control cable of a center-pull type caliper brake
which checks displacement of the connecting element form a
transversely middle position of a bicycle, thereby allowing
right and left brake shoes to contact a wheel rim simultaneously
with greater assurance. The above object is
