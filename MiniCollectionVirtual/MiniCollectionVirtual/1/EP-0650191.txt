<ABSTRACT>
A structure of semiconductor IC (Integrated Circuit) chip 
carrier feasible for a multi-terminal arrangement and high-speed 

signal propagation. Input/output terminals in the form 
of pins (50a) having intermediate flanges are directly provided on 

the circuit surface of an IC chip (50) to serve as the leads of a 
chip carrier. A heat spreader (52) is soldered (54) or otherwise 

affixed to the rear of the IC chip and plays the role of the 
body of the chip carrier. The IC chip itself may be buried 

in the heat spreader by a seal resin (56).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor IC 
(Integrated Circuit) chip carrier and, more particularly, to a 
structure of a semiconductor IC chip carrier implementing a 
multi-terminal arrangement and high-speed signal propagation. A semiconductor IC chip usually has input/output 
terminals in peripheral portions thereof and has such terminals 
connected to an external circuit board via a chip carrier on 
which the chip is mounted. This kind of chip carrier is disclosed 
in, for example, "Microelectronics Packaging Handbook" edited 
by Rao R. Tummala et al, page 531. The chip carrier taught in 
this document includes a lead frame carrying a semiconductor IC 
chip thereon and connected by lead wires to input/output 
terminals which are positioned in the peripheral portions of the 
chip. A plastic member covers the lead wires other than those 
connected to the circuit board in the peripheral portion, and the 
entire chip. Specifically, the chip having the input/output 
terminals in the peripheral portions thereof is mounted on the 
lead frame, and the lead frame connected to the input/output 
terminals is positioned in the peripheral portions of the chip  
 
carrier. Such a conventional structure is not feasible for a 
multi-terminal arrangement which is essential for high 
integration. This is because the conventional structure does not 
allow a great number of connecting terminals to be provided 
thereon, compared to a structure having connecting terminals to 
be connected to a circuit board on the major surface of a chip 
carrier, as distinguished from the peripheral portions. For 
example, assume that connecting terminals are provided on a 10 
millimeters square chip carrier at a pitch of 0.5 millimeter. 
When connecting terminals are formed on the four sides of such 
a chip carrier, 20 terminals are provided on one side (10รท0.5=20) 
and, therefore, 80 terminals are provided in total. By 
contrast, when connecting terminals are formed on the major 
surface of the chip carrier at a pitch of 0.5 millimeter, 400 
terminals are attainable (20 ร 20 = 400). In light of this, a 
chip carrier called PGA (Pin Grid Array) is available, as taught 
in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 5893/1989. However, 
even with a PGA type chip carrier having connecting terminals on 
the major surface thereof, the IC chip has the input/output 
terminals in the peripheral portions thereof and is, therefore, 
not satisfactory regarding the connection of the chip to the chip 
carrier. A conventional chip carrier has
