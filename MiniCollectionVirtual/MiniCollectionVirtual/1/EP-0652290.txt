<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of regulation of gene expression and 
specifically to the regulation of transcription factor NF-κB through regulation of 
degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is an inducible transcription factor which 
participates in the regulation of multiple cellular genes after treatment of cells 
with factors such as phorbol ester, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1 (IL-1) 
and tumor necrosis factor α. These genes are involved in the immediate early 
processes of immune, acute phase, and inflammatory responses. NF-κB has 
also been implicated in the transcriptional activation of several viruses, most 
notably the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) (Nabel, et al., Nature, 
326:711, 1987; Kaufman, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 7:3759, 1987). NF-κB is a dimeric transcription factor that binds and regulates gene 
expression through decameric cis-acting κB DNA motifs. Although a p50/p65 
heterodimer has traditionally been referred to as NF-κB and remains the 
prototypical and most abundant form, it has been recognized recently that 
several distinct but closely related homo- and heterodimeric factors are 
responsible for κB site-dependent DNA binding activity and regulation. The 
various dimeric factors are composed of members of the family of Rel-related 
polypeptides. One subclass of this family, distinguished by its proteolytic  
 
processing from precursor forms and lack of recognized activation domains, 
includes p50 (NFKB1) and p50B (NFKB2, p52), whereas the second subclass 
contains recognized activation domains and includes p65 (RelA), ReIB, c-Rel, 
v-Rel, and the Drosophila protein Dorsal. All Rel-related members share a 300-amino 
acid region of homology, responsible for DNA binding and dimerization, 
called the Rel homology domain. In the cytoplasm, NF-κB and Rel proteins 
form a "Rel complex". Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor and various related forms can be 
initiated by a variety of agents, including TNFα, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 
(PMA), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Activation proceeds through 
a post-translational event in which preformed cytoplasmic NF-κB in the Rel 
complex is released from a cytoplasmic inhibitory protein, IκBα. IκBα inhibits 
transactivation of the p50/p65 heterodimer, by binding to the p65 component, 
blocking the dimer's translocation to the nucleus. IκBα also inhibits complexes 
containing c-Rel or RelB. IκBα blocks binding of various NF-κB dimers
