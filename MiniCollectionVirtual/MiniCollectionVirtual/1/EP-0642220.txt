<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a SAW filter comprising a first and second pair of 
substantially equivalent SAW transducers electrically coupled to form a bridge 

circuit. Each of the transducers of the first pair of transducers have a centre 
frequency which is slightly different to the centre frequency of each of the 

transducers of the second pair of transducers. The product of the static 
capacitance of the first pair is the same as the product of the static 

capacitance of the second pair. In use, signals input to the filter and having 
a frequency within the passband of the filter are coupled to the output of the 

bridge circuit via one or other or both arms of the bridge, as in normal bridge 
circuit operation. However, out of band signals are blocked since all the 

transducers are equivalent capacitors having the same capacitance (i.e. static 
capacitance). Thus, transmission of out of band signals through the filter is 

inhibited by the balanced nature of the bridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filter. In particular, 
it relates to a SAW filter comprising at least two pairs of SAW impedance 
elements electrically coupled to form a bridge circuit. SAW technology has found a number of applications in the electronics and RF 
art. Due to the fact that SAW wavelengths are typically 10⁵ times shorter 
than that of electromagnetic waves, SAW technology has found particular 
applications where miniaturisation is important or desirable. One such 
application is the use of SAW filters in radio telephones where the typically 
small size and weight of SAW filters is highly advantageous over conventional 
technologies, such as ceramic filters, dielectric filters, and filters using 
magnetostatic principles. It is a requirement of such filters that they have 
low-loss, typically insertion losses of 1∼3dB. A typical example of a conventional SAW filter is a transversal SAW filter in 
which SAW energy is transferred between two spaced apart interdigital 
transducers (IDTs). The IDTs each comprise two sets of electrode fingers 
which are formed on the surface of a piezoelectric substrate. The fingers in 
each set are typically all electrically connected together and are interleaved 
(interdigitated) with the electrode fingers of the other set. In the simplest form 
of IDT, the spacing between adjacent fingers of a set is one acoustic 
wavelength i.e. one per period. However, it is possible to have more than one 
finger per acoustic wavelength (period), and a corresponding number on the 
other set. In a transversal SAW filter, electromagnetic energy is converted 
into SAW energy by coupling the electrostatic field pattern of an input IDT to 
a SAW by the piezoelectric effect. A problem with SAW filters is that their 
maximum input power is limited due to the mechanical vibration caused by 
large amplitude SAWs degrading the IDT electrode fingers resulting in lower  
 
performance from the filter; Additionally, conventional filters have relatively 
high losses, typically greater than 10 dB for transversal type SAW filters. 
Similar problems occur with SAW resonator type filters. A known filter which addresses the problem of limited maximum input power 
is disclosed in an article entitled "Miniature SAW Antenna Duplexer for 800-MHz 
Portable Telephone Used in Cellular Radio Systems", IEEE MTT vol. 36 
No 6 June 1988. The known filter utilises electrically cascade-connected 
SAW IDTs of a type known as SAW resonators and conventional capacitors 
connected in
