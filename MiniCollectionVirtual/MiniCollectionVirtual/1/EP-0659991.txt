<ABSTRACT>
A system for controlling the flow of air entering the 
intake manifold (34) of a multi cylinder variable 

displacement internal combustion engine installed in a 
vehicle having a driver-operable accelerator control 

includes an accelerator control position sensor (14) for 
determining the operating position of the accelerator 

control and for generating an accelerator control position 
signal indicating such position, as well as an engine speed 

sensor (16) for determining the speed of the engine and for 
generating an engine speed signal indicating such speed. 

The present system further includes an engine cylinder 
operator (20) for deactivating and reactivating at least 

some of the cylinders and an electronically controlled 
throttle valve (24) positioned in the intake manifold (34) 

of the engine so as to control the amount of air entering 
the engine's cylinders. A processor (10) connected with the 

cylinder operator (20) and with the throttle valve (24) 
receives the accelerator control position signal and the 

engine speed signal and selects an operating position for 
the throttle valve, based on the values of the accelerator 

control position signal and the engine speed signal, as well 
as upon the effective displacement of the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for operating an
electronic air throttle for a multi-cylinder variable
displacement internal combustion engine installed in a
vehicle having a driver operable accelerator control.Automotive vehicle designers and manufacturers have
realised for years that it is possible to obtain increased
fuel efficiency if an engine can be operated on less than
the full complement of cylinders during certain running
conditions. Accordingly, at low speed, low load operation,
it is possible to save fuel if the engine can be run on four
instead of eight cylinders or three, instead of six
cylinders. In fact, one manufacturer offered a 4-6-8
variable displacement engine several years ago, and Ford
Motor Company designed a 6-cylinder engine capable of
operation on only three cylinders which, although never
released for production, was developed to a highly refined
state. Unfortunately, both of the aforementioned engines
suffered from deficiencies associated with their control
strategies. Specifically, customer acceptance of the engine
system actually in production was unsatisfactory because the
power train tended to "hunt" or shift frequently between the
various cylinder operating modes. In other words, the
engine would shift from 4 to 8 cylinder operation
frequently, while producing noticeable torque excursions.
This had the undesirable effect of causing the driver to
perceive excessive changes in transmission gear in the
nature of downshifting or upshifting. Another drawback to
prior art systems resided in the fact that the engine's
torque response corresponding to a given change in the
accelerator pedal position varied quite widely with the
number of cylinders actually in operation. For example,
when the engine was in 8-cylinder operation, a given change
in the accelerator pedal position would produce a certain 
change in engine torque output at any particular engine
speed. However, when the engine was operated at less than
the total number of cylinders, e.g., 4 or 6 cylinders, for
the same change in accelerator pedal position a much reduced
torque response was available. As a result, the vehicles
felt sluggish and non-responsive to driver input.US-A-5267541 discloses a control system for a variable
displacement engine for an automobile which changes a number
of the cylinders of the engine when an engine load changes.
The system sets an amendment value to a throttle valve
opening in accordance with a throttle valve opening and an
engine revolution. The system controls the throttle valve

<CLAIMS>
A system for controlling the flow of air entering
the intake manifold (34) of a multi cylinder variable

displacement internal combustion engine installed in a
vehicle having a manually operable accelerator control (30),

said system comprising:

a first throttle valve (36) positioned in the intake
manifold (34) and coupled to said accelerator control (30);
a position sensor (14) for determining the operating
position of the accelerator control (30) and for generating

an accelerator control position signal indicating such
position;
an engine speed sensor (16) for determining the speed
of the engine and for generating an engine speed signal

indicating such speed;
engine cylinder operator means (20) for deactivating
and reactivating at least some of said cylinders;
a second throttle valve which is an electronically
controlled throttle valve (24) positioned in the intake

manifold (34) of the engine, so as to control the amount of
air entering the engine cylinders; and
a processor (10) connected with said cylinder operator
means (20) and with said throttle valve (24), with 
said
processor comprising:
means for receiving said accelerator control position
and engine speed signals;
means for selecting the number of cylinders to be
operated and for commanding the cylinder operator means (20)

to activate the selected number of cylinders; and
means for selecting an operating position for the
second throttle valve, based on the values of the

accelerator control position and engine speed signals, as
well as upon the number of activated cylinders.
A system according to Claim 1, wherein said
processor utilises a transfer function of accelerator 

control position, including instantaneous position and the
time rate of change of pedal position.
A system according to Claim 1, further comprising a
servo motor coupled to said second throttle valve (24), as

well as to said processor (10), for positioning the second
throttle valve in response to commands from the processor.
A system according to Claim 1, wherein air entering the
engine passes said first valve (36) first and then said

second valve (24), with said valves being separated such
that the air flow past the electronically controlled valve

(24) is fully developed.
A system according to Claim 4, wherein said first
throttle valve (36) is operated such that the flow of air

entering the engine cylinders is only minimally affected by
the first throttle valve (36) once the speed of the engine

exceeds an idle speed limit.
A system according to Claim 1, further comprising means
for operating a transmission connected with the engine such

that the transmission gear is selected by said processor
(10), based at least in part upon the value of the

accelerator control position signal.
A system according to Claim 1, wherein said processor
(10) selects the operating position of the second throttle

valve (24) such that the changes in torque output of the
engine which accompany changes in the position of the

accelerator control remain substantially unaltered when the
number of activated cylinders changes.
A system according to Claim 1, wherein said processor
selects the operating position of the second throttle valve

(24) based not only upon the values of the accelerator
control position and engine speed signals, but also upon a 

correction factor calculated from the measured airflow
through the engine.
A system according to Claim 1, wherein said processor
(10) selects the operating position of the second throttle

valve (24) based not only upon the values of the accelerator
control position and engine speed signals, but also upon the

vehicle speed.
