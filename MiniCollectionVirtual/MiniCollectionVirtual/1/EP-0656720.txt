<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a facsimile apparatus and 
controlling method, in which a confidential box number for PC 

transmission function for sending received information to a 
personal computer (15) is preliminarily registered. When a 

facsimile correspondence accompanying the confidential box 
number for PC transmission function is received, a control 

section (1) sends out the received information to an interface 
(10). Thus, the facsimile apparatus can distinguish 

information to be destined for the personal computer (15) from 
other received information to automatically send the 

information to the personal computer (15) by utilizing a 

confidential communication function thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a facsimile apparatus 
capable of performing data communications with information 
processing apparatus such as a personal computer, and 
controlling methods thereof. A function of carrying out a direct facsimile 
transmission of a document prepared by means of a personal 
computer and receiving image data transmitted from a facsimile 
apparatus via a telephone line is referred to as PC-FAX. To 
realize the PC-FAX function, a personal computer is connected 
through a fax modem having a facsimile communication function 
to a telephone line or, alternatively, connected to a 
facsimile apparatus having a data communication interface such 
as RS-232C. An operation of taking information received by a facsimile 
apparatus into a personal computer is as follows. First, the 
operation mode of the facsimile apparatus is switched from an 
ordinary operation mode to a PC-FAX mode. The PC-FAX mode can 
be set by sending an instruction in a form of a control  
 
command called AT command from the personal computer. In the 
PC-FAX mode, information received in accordance with a 
facsimile communication procedure is sent to the personal 
computer. On the other hand, information received in the 
ordinary operation mode is printed out in a printer section of 
the facsimile apparatus. In the aforementioned conventional facsimile apparatus 
having the PC-FAX function, whether received image data is 
printed out by the printer section of the facsimile apparatus 
or is sent to the personal computer is determined based on the 
operation mode of the facsimile apparatus, i.e., whether the 
operation mode is the ordinary operation mode or the PC-FAX 
mode. That is, the facsimile apparatus does not have a 
function of judging, when receiving information, whether the 
received information is to be sent to the personal computer or 
printed out in the printer section. Therefore, if a facsimile 
correspondence is to be received by a recipient facsimile 
apparatus in the PC-FAX mode, a transmitter has to tell a 
receiver to switch the operation mode of a recipient facsimile 
apparatus to the PC-FAX mode before carrying out a 
transmission operation. Conventionally, such situation makes the facsimile 
receiving operation through the PC-FAX function extremely 
inconvenient.  To solve the aforesaid technical difficulty, it is an 
object of the present invention to provide a facsimile 
apparatus which can distinguish and extract information to be 
sent to an information processing apparatus such as a

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus comprising: 
   an information output means (10) for sending out 

information received through facsimile communications to an 
external information processing apparatus such as a computer 

(15); characterized by, 
   a judging means (1, S4) for judging, when information is 

received through facsimile communications, whether or not the 
received information contains predetermined particular data, 

and outputting a signal if the received information contains 
said predetermined particular data; and 

   means (1) for sending the received information to the 
information output means (10) in response to the signal output 

from the judging means. 
A facsimile apparatus as set forth in claim 1, wherein 
   said predetermined particular data includes a given 

control signal comprised in a facsimile communication 
procedure. 
A facsimile apparatus as set forth in claim 1 or 2, 
further comprising: 

   a plurality of information storing areas (17); and 
   a confidential correspondence controlling means (1) 

adapted to store, when information having a confidential 
correspondence signal is received, the received information in 

an information storing area designated by information of the 
 

confidential correspondence signal, and to read out the 
received information stored in the information storing area 

(17) when a predetermined password is input; 
   said judging means (1, S4) being adapted to output a 

signal if the confidential correspondence signal comprised in 
the received information agrees with predetermined particular 

information. 
A method of controlling a facsimile apparatus capable of 
performing data communications with an external information 

apparatus such as a computer, said method characterized by 
comprising the steps of: 

   judging, when a facsimile correspondence is received, 
whether or not information of the received facsimile 

correspondence contains predetermined particular data; and 
   sending out the information of the received facsimile 

correspondence for data communications if the information of 
the received facsimile correspondence contains the 

predetermined particular data. 
A method of controlling a facsimile apparatus as set 
forth in claim 4, wherein 

   said judging step comprising the steps of: 
   judging whether or not the information of the received 

correspondence is confidential; 
   judging whether or not a confidential correspondence 

signal contains any number other than numbers assigned to 
 

information storing areas if the information of the received 
correspondence is confidential; and 

   outputting a signal indicating that the information of 
the received correspondence is to be output through data 

communications if the confidential correspondence signal 
contains any number other than the numbers assigned to the 

designating information storing areas.
