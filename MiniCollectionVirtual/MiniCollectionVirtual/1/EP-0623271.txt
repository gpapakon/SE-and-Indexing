<ABSTRACT>
An automatic kinescope bias (AKB) arrangement embodied in an integrated circuit (IC) (500) includes circuitry (520) for generating a timing signal (SAMPLE PULSE) during an AKB test interval, circuitry (510, 530) for generating a test signal (I SAMPLE) in response to the timing signal, and circuitry (SW2) including an output terminal (VIDEO OUT) for coupling the test signal to the kinescope (300). The AKB IC also includes an input terminal (VIDEO IN) and a switching element (SW1) coupled between the input terminal and the output terminal and responsive to the timing signal for selectively decoupling the input terminal from the output terminal. In a television system which includes a bias network (400) which is coupled to the output of the video signal source (100) and which inhibits the kinescope from being cutoff during the AKB test interval, the input terminal of the AKB IC is coupled to the output terminal of the video signal source. This allows the bias network to be decoupled from the display device during the AKB test interval, thereby preventing the bias network from affecting AKB operation. Alternatively, in a television system which does not include a bias network which inhibits the kinescope from being cutoff during the AKB test interval, the output terminal of the AKB IC is directly coupled to the output terminal of the video signal source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an automatic kinescope bias
(AKB) arrangement for use in a television system such as a
television receiver or video monitor.An AKB system compensates for changes in the cutoff
voltage of a kinescope (or cathode ray tube) due to temperature,
for example, during warm-up, and aging. The compensation is
accomplished by inserting small offset currents into the kinescope
driver circuits of each of the color channels to effectively change
the respective cathode bias voltages. The magnitudes of the offset
currents are varied according to cutoff measurements made
during respective lines of the vertical blanking period of every
field. In US-A-4,356,508 a television system comprising an AKB
system is disclosed. It utilizes a test signal in a
blanking interval and the pulse injection is done on the
luminance (Y) and the two color difference signals
(R-Y, B-Y) with a switch circuit. The compensation is
done on the matrixed color components (RGB).It is desirable to provide an AKB arrangement which
may be embodied in an integrated circuit (IC), and which may be
capable of being used in various television systems having
different configurations. It is also desirable that such AKB IC be
capable of being added as an optional feature to a television
system without significant changes to its basic architecture. More
specifically, it is desirable to provide an AKB IC which is capable
of being used in a television system which includes a bias network
which affects the kinescope bias from being cutoff while the AKB
measurements are being made, as well as in a television system
which does not contain such a bias network.An aspect of the invention concerns an AKB IC, for use
in a television system including a source of a video signal, a
display device such as a kinescope, means for amplifying the
video signal to produce an amplified version of the video signal
and means for coupling the amplified version of the video signal 
to the display device. The AKB IC includes means for generating a
timing signal during an AKB test interval, means for generating a
test signal in response to the timing signal, and means including
an output terminal for coupling the test signal to the display
device. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the AKB IC
also includes an input terminal and a switching element coupled
between the input terminal and the output terminal and
responsive to the timing signal for selectively decoupling the
input terminal from the output terminal. In a television system
which includes a
