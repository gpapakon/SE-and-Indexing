<ABSTRACT>
A light source (200) comprises an organic light emitting device (100) which emits
radiation having a first spectrum and a phosphor layer (115) which absorbs a portion

of the light emitted by the organic light emitting layer (100) and which emits light
having a second spectrum. The phosphor layer (115) typically absorbs less than all of

the light emitted by the organic light emitting layer (100) and typically covers the
entire organic light emitting device (100). The light emitted by the organic light

emitting layer (100) is mixed with the light emitted by the phosphor layer (115) to
produce light having a third spectrum.. Exemplary embodiments of the invention

provide advantages over known devices For example, because a phosphor layer (115)
is provided, the light emitted from the organic light emitting device (100) is scattered,

which provides improved uniformity in light output over the area of the light source
(200). Also, because most phosphors are relatively stable over time, the light source

(200) has good color stability over time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to lighting applications, and more
particularly to a light source comprising an organic light emitting device combined
with a layer of photoluminescent material which may have a relatively large area.There are many examples of lighting devices which comprise inorganic light
emitting diodes (LEDs) or organic light emitting devices (OLEDs). One example is
the commercially available blue inorganic gallium nitride (GaN) LEDs which are
coated with phosphor particles to produce white light. These LEDs are essentially
point sources of light rather than extended sources of light.An example of an OLED is set forth in U.S. Patent 5,294,870, which describes
an organic electroluminescent multicolor display device comprising an organic
electroluminescent source emitting blue light with green- and red-emitting fluorescent
materials applied to different subpixel areas. This device emits different colors from
the different subpixel areas by color shifting with the green- and red-emitting
fluorescent materials.Another example of an OLED is described in Junji Kido et al., "Multilayer
White Light-Emitting Organic Electroluminescent Device", 267 Science 1332-1334
(1995). This device includes three emitter layers with different carrier transport
properties, each emitting blue, green, or red light, which layers are used to generate
white light. In this device, however, the layers emitting the different colors typically
degrade over time at different rates. Consequently, the color of the device is likely to 
change over time. In addition, the uniformity of the light output over the emitting area
of the device may be less than desirable.A light source, according to one aspect of the invention, comprises an organic
light emitting device which emits light having a first spectrum and a layer of
photoluminescent material which absorbs a portion of the light emitted by the organic
light emitting layer and which emits light having a second spectrum. The layer of
photoluminescent material, which may comprise an inorganic phosphor, typically
absorbs less than all of the light emitted by the organic light emitting layer. The light
emitted by the organic light emitting layer is mixed with the light emitted by the
photoluminescent material to produce light having a third spectrum.Exemplary embodiments of the invention provide advantages over known
devices. For example, if a phosphor is used as the photoluminescent layer, the light
emitted from the organic light emitting device is scattered, which
