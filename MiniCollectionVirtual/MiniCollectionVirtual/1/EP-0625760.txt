<ABSTRACT>
The gaming system includes a host computer, a plurality of general purpose 
terminal computers forming player stations remote from the host, means for 

providing communication between each of the terminals and the host. Each 
terminal has a program for generating screen graphics and sound locally in 

response to control data packets generated by and received from the host. 
The host generates random numbers for a game being played on a connected 

terminal within preset criteria for that game in response to data packets 
received from the terminal. The data packets are of variable length between 

1 and 80 bytes. The host sequentially stores the minimum significant 
information for replaying a game, auditing and security, such as accounting 

data of each player at the start of each game, random numbers generated by 
the host, responses received from a player, and whether a game was 

completed. Play is substantially real-time, because only minimal data is 
transmitted with functions requiring large amounts of data, such as screen 

graphics being generated locally. The statuses of host and terminal are 
restored automatically on re-establishing communication following an 

interruption to ensure fairness to players and prevent them defeating the 
outcome of a game.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an interactive, real time, realistic "home" computer
gaming system using general purpose computers. The system comprises
a central or host computer, a plurality of terminal computers forming
player stations remote from the host, communicating means for connecting
each of the terminals to the host, and program means for operating the
computers and the communication between the terminals and host. Aspects of
the invention concern auditing and security to ensure fairness for players
and prevent players defeating the outcome of a game; fast, efficient
communication to enable reliable, low cost, real time, realistic operation;
accounting; and enabling players to play a variety of games.Many computerised gaming systems have been proposed having a host and
terminals, which may be remote or local, with different operating systems
depending largely on the game being played. The broad general groupings
are discussed below as a survey of the art.One group is centred on horse betting using home or agency terminals. Home
terminal systems usually use a teletext or teletext type interface to
display betting and account data on the terminal and to input bets to the
host often coupled with a control for television viewing. Data may also be
transmitted through a telephone system. Betting inputs are simple, such a
horse or horse couple number. Patents disclosing typical systems are
JP-A-1-269157 to JP-A-1-269164. Agency terminals are broadly similar, but have
betting slip reading and/or printing facilities. Patents disclosing
typical systems are FR-A-2,368,092, GB-A-2,269,926, 2,262,635, 2,075,369,
2,028,558, 1,491,780. Such systems are not interactive; are not real time
because of the delays in transmitting large volumes of data; have limited
auditing and/or playback capabilities because of the large amount of data
that has to be stored; and are not realistic in that limited information
only is displayed on the terminal screens. Auditing and data storage is 
problematical and generally, if there is a fault, then a
bet is voided. Such systems are restricted to one form of
gaming only and use dedicated or special equipment; as
such are unsuitable for general gaming purposes.A second group, typified by US-A-4,922,522 and PCT
applications WO 92/10806 and WO 89/05490, are computer
based lottery ticket distributing systems. Apart from
providing systems for the practical demands of
participants, such as selection verification, ticket
reading, etc., these systems are primarily concerned with
data
