<ABSTRACT>
Radiopharmaceuticals for imaging myocardial tissues are prepared by forming lipophilic, cationic complexes of radioactive metal ions with metal chelating ligands comprising the Schiff base adducts of triamines and tetraamines with optionally substituted salicylaldehydes. The lipophilic, cationic, radioactive complexes of the invention exhibit high uptake and retention in myocardial tissues. Preferred gallium-68(III) complexes in accordance with this invention can be used to image the heart using positron emission tomography.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RADIOPHAR ΆCEUTICALS FOR IMAGING THE HEARTField of the InventionThis invention relates to novel radiopharmaceuticals and their use for tissue imaging.More particularly this invention is directed to novel metal ion chelating ligands, their cationic lipophilic complexes with radioactive metal ions and the use of such complexes for imaging the heart.Background and Summary of the InventionThe use of radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic imaging has evolved significantly over the last decade. There has been a substantial research and development effort directed not only to identification and development of radiopharmaceutical agents themselves, but as well to the development of the electronics hardware used for detecting and displaying radiotracer images of targeted organs/tissue. While tissue imaging techniques have been developed utilizing a wide variety of radioactive elements, those that have received most attention are radiopharmaceuticals formed with gamma or positron emitting radionuclides. The use of positron emitting radiopharmaceuticals has been of particular research interest. Indeed, positron emission tomography (•■PET") has been shown to be a most powerful medical imaging technique that can quantitatively map the spatial distribution of positron-emitting nuclides inside the living body. Currently, PET imaging studies of regional perfusion in the brain and heart have found applications both in biomedical research and in clinical practice. In studies of the heart with PET, assessment of yocardial perfusion and perfusion reserve after exercise or pharmacologic coronary vasodilation has been useful both diagnostically and for 

research evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease.The clinical applications of PET and other radiotracer imaging techniques have been limited both by the availability of the required radionuclides and by the inherent biodistribution properties of radiopharmaceutical agents. Thus, for example, high definition imaging of heart tissue requires not only efficient myocardial uptake of the radiopharmaceutical agent but, as well, retention of the radioactivity in the targeted tissue. The ideal radiopharmaceutical agent exhibits a biodistribution pattern which will provide higher concentrations of the radiopharmaceutical in the targeted tissue relative to the blood levels and relative to radiopharmaceutical concentrations in adjacent non-targeted tissues. Thus, the significant properties of radiopharmaceuticals designed for imaging the heart are high myocardial tissue
