strokes, respectively, of the suction nozzle over the floor during the vacuum cleaning 
operation, with a difference in amplitude (ΔP) between these maxima and minima which 

varies in dependence on the type of floor being cleaned, and this signal on the other 
hand having an average amplitude (PM) which lies between the amplitudes of the 

maxima (γ) and minima (ε) and which varies with the type of floor being cleaned, the 
neuron network (40) determines the type of floor being cleaned as a joint function of the

comprises a second pressure detector (25) for providing a signal which is a function of 

the difference in average air pressure measured between the inlet (PM) and the outlet 
(PM') of the dust chamber (12), and in that the neuron network (40) determines the 

type of floor being cleaned as a joint function of the characteristics of the signal of the 
first pressure detector (14) (ΔP, PM) and of the difference in average amplitude

setpoint generating means (50) determine a setpoint value (51) for said average 

amplitude (PM) of the signal of the first pressure detector (14) as a function of the
