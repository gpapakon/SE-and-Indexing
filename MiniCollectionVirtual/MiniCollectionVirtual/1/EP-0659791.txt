ii) 0 to 95% by weight of another polyisocyanate adduct, and 
b) an aldimine based on the reaction product of a polyamine having 2 
or more primary amino groups with an aldehyde corresponding to 

the formula:


O=CHCH(R₁)(R₂)



 
wherein R₁ and R₂ may be the same or different and represent 

optionally substituted hydrocarbon radicals, or R₁ and R₂ together 
with the β-carbon atom form a cycloaliphatic or heterocyclic ring

prepared from diamino dicyclohexyl methane and an aldehyde 

corresponding to the preceding formula.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to coating compositions
having long pot lives and short dry times under ambient conditions in
which the binder is based on polyisocyanates, aldimines and optionally
compounds which are catalysts for the reaction between isocyanate
groups and hydroxyl groups.Coating compositions which may be cured at room
temperature are known. One-component coating compositions contain
fully reacted polyurethanes as the binder. These compositions have the
advantage that they are available as fully formulated systems which may
be directly applied to suitable substrates without any preliminary steps
except for mild stirring. Disadvantages of these systems are that large
amounts of organic solvents are needed to reduce the viscosity of fully
reacted, i.e., high molecular weight, polyurethanes. The coating
compositions are cured by evaporation of the solvent which is
objectionable from an environmental perspective. In addition, in order to
solubilize the polyurethanes in organic solvents, they must be essentially
linear polyurethanes. While such polyurethanes possess properties
which are suitable for many applications, they do not provide certain
properties, e.g., solvent resistance which may be obtained from
crosslinked polyurethanes.Two-component coating compositions are also known.
These compositions come in two containers. The first contains a
polyisocyanate, while the second contains an isocyanate-reactive
component, generally a polyol. The components are not mixed until they
are ready to be used. One advantage of these compositions is that 
because the components are not pre-reacted to form a high molecular
weight polymer, a suitable processing viscosity can be achieved without
the need for large amounts of organic solvents. In addition, higher
functional components can be used to obtain highly crosslinked coatings
which possess properties which surpass those possessed by one-component
coatings.The disadvantages of these compositions is that they
cannot be applied without a preliminary mixing step in which it is critical
that the components are mixed in the right proportions. In addition,
special metering and mixing equipment is needed to conduct this process
on a commercial scale. If the components are mixed in the wrong
proportions, then the properties of the resulting coatings can be
substantially affected. In addition, after the components are mixed they
must be used in a timely fashion. If not, they continue to react until an
unusable solid is obtained.It is an object of the
