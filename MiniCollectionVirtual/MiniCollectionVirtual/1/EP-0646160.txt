<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for adding an odorant to a consumer gas which is distributed to a consumer site, in order to indicate to people in the vicinity of the risk of fire, explosion, poisoning, suffocation or some other danger, should consumer gas leak into the surrounding atmosphere. The odorant is dissolved in a condensed vehicle gas in a pressure vessel (3), to obtain a solution, master gas, which includes a liquid phase (6) and a gas phase (7). The consumer gas is diluted with an adapted quantity of the liquid phase of the master gas, which is vaporized prior to being mixed with the consumer gas. To this end, the arrangement includes means (18) for correcting the relationship between the two gas flows during the dilution process with respect to the increase in the concentration of odorant in the liquid phase (6) of the master gas that results from the decreasing relationship between the quantity of liquid gas and gas phase (7) in the pressure vessel. This provides for extremely accurate metering of the master gas. The invention also relates to a method of adding an odorant to a consumer gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for adding an 
odorant to a consumer gas which is distributed to a consumer 
site so as to draw to the attention of people in the vicinity 
of the risk of fire, explosion, poisoning, suffocation or 
some other danger should the consumer gas escape to the 
surrounding atmosphere. In the event of a gas escape, the 
odorant, which is in a concentrated form, preferably an 
organic sulphur compound, is dissolved in a condensed vehicle 
gas contained in a pressure vessel, for instance carbon 
dioxide, propane or butane, so as to form a solution, a 
master gas, which includes a liquid phase and a gas phase. 
The desired odorant concentration of the consumer gas is then 
achieved by diluting the odorant with an adapted quantity of 
the liquid phase of the master gas, which is vaporized prior 
to being mixed with the consumer gas. The amount of master 
gas added is determined by the flow rate of master gas and 
the odorant concentration of said master gas and the flow 
rate of the consumer gas. The concept of adding odorants to consumer gases in 
accordance with the aforegoing, so as to indicate the leakage 
of poisonous or explosive gases for instance, has long been 
known to the art. One example of gases which may be odorized 
in this way is oxygen, which if leaking to the surroundings 
can result in extremely serious accidents caused by fire or 
explosion. Other examples include combustible gases, such as 
natural gas, propane, butane, town gas, etc., which can also 
cause serious accidents in the form of fire and explosions. 
Since the majority of odorous additives, such as tetrahydro 
thiophene, butyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulphide, etc., are 
readily ignitable substances which require the application of 
special techniques when added to oxygen for instance. Finish Patent Application 870146 discloses a method of 
adding an odorant to oxygen, in which a concentrated gas, so-called  
 
master gas, is produced in a separate chamber or space 
by adding to pure oxygen gas an odorant in a concentration of 
1,000-10,000 ppm. This concentrated master gas is added to 
the consumer gas in a separate chamber, or space, in an 
amount such that the odorant will be present in the consumer 
gas in a concentration of 5-50 ppm. When the master gas contains solely oxygen and odorant, 
for instance dimethyl sulphide, problems can occur, however, 
when filling the master gas containers. For instance, when 
filling the containers, it is impossible to avoid passing 
through a
