<ABSTRACT>
A support (10) for moving an object between two locations. The support (10) has one or more elongate members (12) upon which a platform, such as a seat (50), can be slid. The elongate member (12) has a guide rail (15) which has two flanges (17) each terminated with an arcuate groove (18). The flanges (17) and the arcuate grooves (18) form a track (22) in which wheels (24) of the seat (50) can run. Typically, the support (10) is used for moving the seat (5) into and out of a shower recess or over a bath for the bathing of the aged and invalids. The guide rail (15) can also be used as a curtain track, a track for a sliding panel and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLESUPPORT MEANS FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a support means for moving an object between two locations. The support means of the present invention is particularly, although not exclusively, envisaged for use by the invalid or disabled for use in moving into and out of a shower or bath. The support means is also envisaged for use in moving objects in general from one place to another.One of the greatest difficulties faced by invalids or disabled persons in their daily routine is bathing. Due to ill-health, old-age or disability a person may not be able to stand-up without assistance whilst taking a shower. To help such a person a chair or stool can be placed in the shower recess or bath area so that the person can have a shower whilst being seated. A disadvantage of such chairs or stools is that an able bodied person assisting the invalid or disabled person must manoeuvre the invalid or disabled person into the shower or bath before being able to seat them on the chair or stool. This is difficult where the shower or bath is small and even more difficult once the shower or bath is wet.Aids have been devised to help make bathing easier for the invalid or disabled. Such aids, have been known to take the form of bath boards which are designed to fix across the top of the bath thereby creating a seating platform for washing or showering. Other aids include bath seats which may be provided with a back rest. Such boards or seats can be secured to the bath by hinged arms which hook onto the top of the bath and are sometimes provided with means to wedge the bottom of the seat to the walls of the bath for additional security. Other securing means take the form of brackets which ensure that the seats or boards remain locked in position.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is an object of the present 

invention is to provide a support means for moving an object between two locations, such as, moving a seat into and out of a bath or a shower recess.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a support means for moving an object between two locations the support means comprising: an elongate member disposed substantially horizontally; a support means for supporting the elongate member; whereby, in use, a platform means can be mounted on the elongate member for sliding therealong between two spaced apart locations.Preferably, the support means is capable of movement between said substantially horizontal position when in use and a substantially vertical position

CLAIMS
1. A support means for moving an object between two locations the support means comprising: an elongate member disposed substantially horizontally; a support means for supporting the elongate member; whereby, in use, a platform means can be mounted on the elongate member for sliding therealong between two spaced apart locations.
2. A support means according to claim 1, in which the elongate member has a guide rail extending substantially along its length, the guide rail defining a track within which a roller means of the platform means can roll, the roller means being limited to movement along the guide rail.
3. A support means according to claim 2, in which the guide rail comprises: a base channel; and, a track depending from one side wall of the base channel, the track having two flanges each terminated in an arcuate groove, the flanges diverging away from the side wall and the arcuate grooves having their concave sides disposed towards each other; whereby, in use, the track can receive and guide the platform means along the base channel.
4. A support means according to claim 3
r
 in which the flanges diverge from the side wall of the base channel at an angle of between 25° and 75° to the side wall.
5. A support means according to claim 4, in which the angle is about 45°.
6. A support means according to claim 2, in which the guide rail has a cut-out in one of the flanges and its arcuate groove for allowing entry and exit of the roller 


means of the platform means from the guide rail.
7. A support means according to claim 6, in which the guide rail has two cut-outs, the cut-outs being spaced apart for simultaneously receiving two spaced apart roller means of the platform means.
8. A support means according to claim 1, in which one end of the elongate member is attached by a pivot means to a structural member and the support member is pivotable between an in-use position and a storage position.
9. A support means according to claim 8, in which the platform means is moveable between a free end of support means and the structural member.
10. A support means according to claim 8, also having a bias means for biasing the support means towards the storage position.
11. A support means according to claim 8, in which the elongate member is disposed at an angle to the horizontal to bias the platform means towards the structural member.
12. A support means according to claim 8, in which the elongate member is disposed at an angle to the horizontal to bias the platform means away from the structural member.
13. A support means according to claim 1, also having a lock means for fixing the platform means to the elongate member at a desired location for inhibiting further sliding of the platform means along the elongate member.
14. A support means according to claim 1, in which the structural member is a wall of a shower recess.
15. A support means according to claim 1, in which the 


structural member is a wall against which is located a bath.
16. A support means according to claim 1, having a p
l
urality of the elongate members.
17. A guide rail for guiding a moveable member, the guide rail comprising: a base channel; and, a track depending from a side wall of the base channel, the trac
k
 having two flanges each terminated in an arcuate groove, the flanges diverging away from the side wall and the arcuate grooves having their concave sides dispose
d
 towards each other; where
b
y, in use, the track can guide the moveable member along the base channel.
18. 
A
 gui
d
e rail according to claim 17, in which the flanges
'
 diverge from the side wall at an angle of between 25° and 7-5° .
ig. A gui
d
e rai
l
 according to claim 18, in which the angle is about 45°.
20. A gui
d
e rail according to claim 17, also having a land located between the flanges.
21. 
A
 gui
d
e rail according to claim 17, in which t
h
e arcuate grooves are semicircular in cross-section.
22. 
A
 gui
d
e rail according to claim 17, also having cut-outs in one of the flanges and its arcuate groove for allowing entry an
d
 exit of a roller means of the movea
b
le- means from the guide rail.
