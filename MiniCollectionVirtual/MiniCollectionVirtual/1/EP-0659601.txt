<ABSTRACT>
A cargo door assembly for pivotally mounted side 
doors in a van-type vehicle is provided with an improved 

reinforcing beam (30). The beam (30) extends vertically 
along the shut face of one door (20) of the assembly and has 

structure at its top for mounting the door latch (40) and a 
hook (54) at its bottom ungageable with the vehicle body 

(12) at its sill (58). The beam (30) is wider at its bottom 
than at its top and presents a simply supported beam to the 

sidewall (3) of the vehicle, enhancing its capacity to 
handle lateral loading, including impact loading.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to vehicle 
doors, and more specifically to reinforcement of vehicle 
doors arranged in the side of van-type vehicles. In the manufacture and sale of automotive vehicles of 
the type generally referred to as vans, it is customary to 
provide for ingress and egress to rear portions of the 
vehicle body through a rearwardly placed side door or doors 
positioned on at least one side of the vehicle. The doors 
are generally of two types: sliding doors and centre 
opening, outwardly swinging cargo doors. Engineering development activity relating to the 
resistance of body structures of the these van-type vehicles 
to the imposition of external forces has resulted in the 
establishment of certain design goals for enhancing the 
resistance of side vehicle structures to the imposition of 
such loads, particularly impact loads. It is known in the prior art to provide reinforcing 
structure for side doors of vehicles. Particularly well-known 
are generally horizontally running reinforcing beams 
in passenger vehicles; U.S. Patent 4,013,317 is exemplary of 
such designs. It is also known to reinforce side cargo 
doors in vans through interengaging structure disposed 
between the two doors. Applicant's co-pending U.S. 
application 07/997,067, discloses such an approach. The 
prior art, however, while effective for its intended 
purpose, reinforces through structure not self-contained in 
the door and does not make use of the load supporting 
strength provided by other portions of the vehicle body. In 
applicant's other design, which is the subject of the 
copending application '067, the reinforcement takes place 
solely between the two cargo doors at their interface. This 
positioning of the interlocking devices of that design 
necessitates the carrying of the extraneous hook and catch 
structure on door surfaces exposed to vehicle users when the  
 
doors are open. This is considered undesirable in certain 
applications. EP 0,348,034 discribes a vehicle door assembly having 
a first door hingedly connected to the vehicle and a second 
door hingedly connected to the vehicle and provided with a 
latch carried on one of the doors and with a striker carried 
on the other door. The assembly does not provide 
reinforcement in either of the doors. Because of the shortcomings and the prior art, it is 
considered desirable that the cargo door reinforcement be 
provided which is integral with the door system and coacts 
with the vehicle body. The desired advantages are realised in the

<CLAIMS>
A cargo door assembly for closing an aperture in the side of a vehicle body 
comprising: 


a first door (20) hingedly connected to the body (12) for movement about a hinge 
between an open position and a closed position; 
a second door (22) hingedly connected to the body (12) for movement about a second 
hinge between an open position and a closed position; 
a latch (42) carried on one (20) of the doors; 
a striker (24) carried on the other (22) of the doors for engagement with the latch;
 
   characterised by a reinforcing beam (30) carried with the one door (20) and extending 

vertically from the latch (42) to the bottom of the one door (20), the beam having a hook 
portion (54) formed at its lower end (52) projecting laterally inwardly toward the vehicle 

body (12); and 
means (58) defining an aperture (56) in the body (12) in juxtaposition with the hook 
portion (54) operative to resist inward movement of the door from the closed position with 

respect to the vehicle body (12). 
A cargo door assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the one door (20) 
includes an inner panel (34) and an outer panel (32) carried in laterally spaced relationship 

and the reinforcing beam is carried intermediate the inner (34) and outer (32) panels. 
A cargo door assembly as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
latch (42) is fixedly mounted adjacent the top of the reinforcing beam (30). 
A cargo door assembly as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the reinforcing beam (30) is formed to have an irregular cross section and is substantially 

greater in lateral thickness proximate the lower end (52) of the reinforcing beam (30). 
A cargo door assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein the one door includes a 
flat closure panel (36) interconnecting the inner (34) and outer (32) panels and the 

reinforcing beam (30) includes a flat panel (40) fixedly secured to the closure panel (36).  
 
A cargo door assembly as claimed in claim 5, wherein the reinforcing beam 
(30) is formed to have an irregular cross section and is substantially greater in lateral 

thickness proximate the lower end (52) of the reinforcing beam (30). 
A cargo door assembly as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the reinforcing beam is formed as a stamping.
