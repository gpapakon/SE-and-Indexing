<ABSTRACT>
A battery-powered rotation detector (16, 16P) 
detects passing of a rotating magnet attached to a 

vehicle wheel to generate and transmit a rotation 
signal. A receiver (50, 50M) receives the rotation 

signal. A processor (51) computes the vehicle running 
condition (e.g., speed, traveled distance) from the 

received rotation signal and displays the results on a 
display device. The processor monitors the interval 

between the rotation signals to detect when the 
vehicle is stopped. When detected, the processor 

disconnects a battery power supply from components 
such as the display device for power savings. In 

addition, the processor checks the strength of the 
received rotation signal to determine capacity of the 

battery in the rotation detector, and operatively 
indicates power failure of the rotation detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for
measuring a running condition of a vehicle by
detecting rotation of a wheel of the vehicle.Wheeled vehicles running on a road or rails
include a bicycle, automobile, electric car or train
etc. Computer-based running condition measuring
apparatus are known which measure or compute a running
condition of the vehicle (e.g., vehicle speed,
traveled distance). Particularly, when applied to the
bicycle, such a running condition measuring apparatus
is called "cycle computer."For example, in the cycle computer, a magnet is
mounted on one of spokes of a front wheel while a
magnetic detector is fixed to a fork blade to detect
passing of the magnet.In the prior art, a reed switch has been used as
the magnetic detector. The reed switch is normally
kept in an OFF condition. When the magnet passes by
the reed switch as the wheel rotates, the reed switch
is turned ON. Thus it generates a magnet detection
signal (reed switch signal) every one revolution of
the wheel. The number of revolutions of the wheel per
unit time is measured from the detection signal. The
cycle computer CPU computes a traveled distance and/or
a speed of the bicycle by multiplying the detected
number of revolutions of the wheel by wheel
circumference data previously stored. A display
device such as a liquid crystal display device (LCD)
displays the computed results.In the prior art running measuring apparatus,
continuous power supply is provided to various
components of the apparatus (e.g., display device)
even when the vehicle is stopped or at rest. This 
results in wasteful power consumption.Some prior art cycle computer employs a
transmitter (first device) including a rotation
detector, and a receiver (second device) including a
CPU for computing the running condition. The first
and second devices are independently powered by their
own battery. When the battery power in the receiver
is used up, the transmitter can no longer send a
rotation signal to the receiver. In the absence of
the rotation signal, the CPU in the receiver mistakes the
power failure of the receiver for the stopped
condition of the vehicle.From EP-A2-0 516 113 it is known to use a wireless velocity detector comprising a
mounting device mounted on the hub of a bicycle wheel and a device for displaying
velocity. Said detector includes a coil that generates a magnetic field when energized.
Further, a pair of coils is positioned in a receiver mounted preferably on the handle bar.
The receiver sends any variation in the strength of the
