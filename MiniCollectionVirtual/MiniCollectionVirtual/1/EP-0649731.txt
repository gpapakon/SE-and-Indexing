A plastic-made reinforced structure comprising 
a thermoplastic resin-made plate and cylindrical rib(s) 

made of the same resin as that of said plate, connected 
to at least one side of said plate perpendicularly to the 

side so that the plate and the rib(s) form one piece, in 
which structure the following relationships hold:

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plastic-made
reinforced structure which is lightweight and yet has
excellent strength.Plastic plates have been in wide use as a
structural material for various applications, owing to
their light weight and excellent physical properties.
They, however, are inferior in static or impact strength
when used in the form of a flat plate; in order to
reinforce the strength, rib(s) are often bonded
to the surface of the plate. As typical examples
of the rib(s)-bonded plate, there are known reinforced
structures comprising (a) a plate and (b) continuous or
independent rectangular box-shaped or honeycomb-shaped
ribs bonded to the plate surface. FR-A-2 325 503,
for example, discloses such reinforced structures.In recent years, these reinforced structures
have been required to be lightweight. Reduction in
amount of rest used for the rib portion in order to achieve
light weight, however, results in a reinforced structure
of low strength because the amount of resin used for 
the rib portion is approximately proportional to the static
and impact strength of the reinforced structure. Thus, it
has been an important task to develop a reinforced
structure of light weight without reducing its strength.It is an object of the present invention
to develop a plastic-made reinforced structure
which is free from the problems of conventional plastic-made
reinforced structures and wherein the amount of
resin used for the rib portion is reduced for a light weight
and yet the strength is the same as or even higher than
those of conventional plastic-made reinforced structures.This object is achieved by the
present invention which provides a plastic-made
reinforced structure comprising a thermoplastic resin-made
plate and cylindrical rib(s) made of the same resin
as that of said plate, connected to at least one side of
said plate perpendicularly to the side so that the plate
and the rib(s) form one piece, in which structure the
following relationships hold:
d1 ≥ 20 mm,1 > d1/d2 ≥ 0.7,H ≥ 30 mm, and1 ≥ d1/H ≥ 0.3
wherein d1 and d2 are the inside and outside diameters of
each rib at the root of the rib, i.e. the joint of the
rib to the plate; and H is the length of each rib from
the root to the front end. 
Fig. 1 shows a plastic-made reinforced structure
having cylindrical ribs, according to the present
invention. In Fig. 1, A is a top plate and B is
individual cylindrical ribs.Fig. 2 shows the sectional view of each rib of
the structure of Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, each number indicates
a length (mm); d1 and
