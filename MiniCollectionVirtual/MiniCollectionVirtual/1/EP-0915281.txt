<ABSTRACT>
A tube joint comprising a first joint unit (1) and a second joint unit (2)
screwed to the first joint unit (1) by a screw (9) formed inside the first joint

unit (1). An O-ring (3), an auxiliary ring (4), a clamping ring (5) and a
pressure ring (6) are disposed in order between the first joint unit (1) and the

second joint unit (2). The clamping ring (5) and the pressure ring (6) are
together contacted with pressure with an insertion tube (17) connected to the

first joint unit (1) by movement of the second joint unit (2) in the axial
direction caused by screwing the second joint unit (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plastic tube joints to transport warm water or tap water
for air conditioning use, especially so-called simple-action tube joints, as stated in the preamble
to the main claim.A tube joint as stated above is shown in US-A-4,138,145. This tube joint includes
cooperating male and female threaded elements and the female threaded element has a
recess containing a pipe-gripping collar which has cause to contract radially on to the pipe
upon tightening of the male element relative to the female element. In order to facilitate
storage and transport of the coupling components, a washer is provided which is resiliency
engageable with the thread of the female element and serves to retain the pipe-gripping
collar within the recess of the female element This washer is preferably a metallic thrust
washer which has a peripheral rubber flange which provides the resilient engagement with
the thread of the female element. As other conventional joints, this tube joint is not applicable
to absorb the lack of uniformity in the diameter size of plastic insertion tubes.It is the object of the present invention is to provide a detachable tube joint which can
be easily inserted or pulled out regardless the precision and/or deformation of the insertion
tube, and which does not need an additional operation of inserting a sleeve into the insertion
tube.In order to solve the above problems, the tube joint of the invention is constructed as
claimed in the main claim. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are characterized in
the sub-claims. When the insertion tube is inserted into the subject tube joint, the jointing operation
is completed by manually rotating the second joint unit a few times with a little force
until the second joint unit is completely inserted. Also, the inserted tube can be released only
by manually rotating the second joint unit a few times to loose the joint. The tube joint according
to the present invention eliminates the difficulties in insertion and detachment and
troublesome use of a sleeve, and can provide reliable joint operations and makes the attaching
and detaching operations easier.Although there are many examples of tube joints using screws, it was necessary to
strongly fasten a packing member or a metal ring having slits with a large force to seal, fix, or
simultaneously to seal and fix an insertion tube. In the mechanism of the tube joint according
to the present invention, the jointing operation can be completed only by force of a screw
rotatable by hand. As

<CLAIMS>
A tube joint comprising:

a first joint unit (1) and a second joint unit (2) screwed to the first joint unit (1) by a
screw (9) formed outside or inside the first joint unit (1);
an 0-ring (3), an auxiliary ring (4), a clamping ring (5) and a pressure ring (6) which are disposed
in order between the first joint unit (1) and the second joint unit (2); and wherein
the clamping ring (5) and the pressure ring (6) are together contacted with pressure
with an insertion tube (17) connectable to the first joint unit (1) by movement of the second

joint unit (2) in the axial direction caused by screwing the second joint unit (2), 
characterized
in that
the clamping ring (5) is a C-shaped ring of a truncated-conical spring material and the pressure ring (6) has
a tapered portion on its periphery, has an inner diameter larger than an inner diameter of the

clamping ring (5), has a circular groove (23) for holding the clamping ring (5), and is capable
of engaging with a tapered surface formed on an inner surface of the second joint unit (2).
Tube joint as described in claim 1, in which the first joint unit (1) has a tapered inner
portion at its tip portion, of which diameter reduces in the direction of insertion of the insertion

tube (17).
Tube joint as described in claim 1 or 2, in which the auxiliary ring (4) of the first joint
unit (1) presses the 0-ring (3) according to the movement of the second joint unit (2), and a

space portion (7) is provided between the first joint unit (1) and the auxiliary ring (4) in order
to define pressing distance.
