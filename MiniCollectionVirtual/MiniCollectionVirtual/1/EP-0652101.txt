<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to barrels used 
in injection molding and extrusion processes and more 
particularly to bimetallic barrels having alloy inlays. 
Injection and extrusion processes are widely used in the 
plastic, chemical, food and ceramic and metal powder 
industries. In injection molding and extrusion processes, 
solid plastic resin is heated and liquefied inside a 
hollow cylinder or barrel by heater bands that envelop 
the cylinder and by the frictional heat generated by the 
rotational action of the screw. The molten plastic is 
discharged from the cylinders and enters a mold. The 
molten plastic solidifies in the mold to form various 
objects. During the plasticization process, the plastic 
resin will wear against the bore of the cylinder. 
Besides, the plastic often contains various fillers which 
are highly abrasive. Also, aggressive chemicals 
generated during the process can corrode the bore. For 
instance, fluoropolymer, polyvinyl chloride, and resins 
containing flame retardants will generate hydrofluoric or 
hydrochloric acid, which are very corrosive. If the bore 
of the cylinder is enlarged due to wear or corrosion, the 
efficiency of the process will decline.  The injection pressure for a plastic injection 
molding machine is typically between 20,000 and 30,000 
psi and could be as high as 37,000 psi. Barrels for 
plasticizing resins not only have to contain the high 
pressure but also have to resist corrosion and wear of 
the bore from the resin. Alloy steels such as 4140, 6150, and 8620 are 
often used as backing steels for bimetallic barrels. 
Their disadvantages are discussed below. Some barrels are made of heat treated and 
nitrided steel. These barrels have good strength, but 
their wear resistant nitrided surface is very thin, 
usually 0.005. to 0.010 inch. Once this thin nitrided 
layer is worn out, accelerated wear will follow. 
Moreover, the nitrided steel has poor corrosion 
resistance to various corrosive resins. A more advanced barrel is made by a centrifugal 
casting process. A corrosion and wear resistant alloy is 
cast in the bore of a steel cylinder to form an inlay by 
centrifugal casting. The inlay is typically 0.060 inch 
to 0.100 inch thick and is metallurgically bonded to the 
steel cylinder bore. These bimetallic barrels have been 
very successful in processing various corrosive and 
abrasive resins. Bimetallic barrels having an inlay alloy 
containing nickel, boron, silicon, tungsten, carbon and 
chromium are widely used. The inlay alloy, designated
