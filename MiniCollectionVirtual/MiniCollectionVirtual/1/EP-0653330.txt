<ABSTRACT>
A support, which is mounted on the rear of a vehicle provided with a ball hitch, for any kind of load, is composed of a horizontal supporting arm (7), the length of which can be modified, and of a hollow profile section which can be extended either by hollow profile sections (23, 24) which can be displaced telescopically with respect to the supporting arm or by means of hollow profile sections (25) which are similar to the profile section and are joined to the supporting arm (7), a rod (13) which extends transversely with respect to the direction of travel being mounted on the ball hitch below the ball head (8) and having two stops (22) arranged symmetrically with respect to the ball head (8), a tubular section (9) taking the form of a cap (11) enclosing the ball head (8) from above being fixedly joined to the supporting arm (7) and a supporting bracket (14) being fastened respectively on both sides of the supporting arm (7) which is directed downwards in the direction of travel in an inclined manner and which at its lower end has a recess by means of which the supporting bracket (14) rests positively on the rod (13) outside the stops (22) as soon as the supporting arm (7) is situated in its intended position and a spindle (16) with an external thread extending in the supporting arm (7) in a sleeve (15) which is directed downwards in the direction of travel in an inclined manner and projects beyond the supporting arm (7), it being possible to move the said spindle longitudinally towards the sleeve (15) by actuating a hand wheel (17) which is situated on the upper end of the sleeve (15) and has an internal thread which engages in the spindle thread and the spindle (16) supporting at its lower end a flat belt (18) which at its lower end, also in the direction of travel, is deformed to form a semicircle (19) which can be brought to rest around the rod (13) so as to be situated between and flush with the stops (22) by means of the spindle (16) when the tubular section (9) is seated on the ball head (8).

Arrangement for transporting loads on the rear 
side of motor vehicles which are provided with a ball 

coupling, by means of a carrying arm which is directed 
horizontally counter to the direction of travel, characterized 

in that the arrangement contains a bar (13) which 
is provided with means for fastening it, transversely 

with respect to the direction of travel, on a ball 
coupling (8), the bar (13) exhibiting two stops (22) 

which are symmetrical with respect to the fastening 
means, and in that a tube piece (9) in the form of a cap 

(11) which engages over the ball head (8) is attached 
fixedly on the carrying arm (7), and there is fastened on 

both sides of the carrying arm (7) in each case a 
supporting plate (14) which is directed obliquely 

downwards in the direction of travel and, at its lower 
end, exhibits a cutout by means of which the supporting 

plate (14) bears in a positively locking manner on the 
bar (13) outside the stop (22) as soon as the carrying 

arm (7) is located in its envisaged position, and in that 
a spindle (16) with an external thread runs in the 

carrying arm (7) in a sleeve (15) which is directed 
obliquely downwards in the direction of travel and 

projects beyond the carrying arm (7), which spindle, by 
the actuation of a handwheel (17) which is located at the 

upper end of the sleeve (15) and has an internal thread 
engaging into the spindle thread, can be moved longitudinally 

with respect to the sleeve (15), and in that, at 
its lower end, the spindle (16) bears a flat band (18) 

which, at its lower end, is deformed in the manner of a 
semicircle (19), likewise in the direction of travel,  

 
which, by means of the spindle (16) and when the tube 

piece (9) is seated on the ball head (8), can be brought 
to bear around the bar (13) flush between the stops (22). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a bore (21) for receiving securing means is 

provided in the tube piece (9). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a horizontal pin (20) which secures the flat 

band (18) against rotation is provided between the 
supporting plates (14). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or one of the 
following claims, characterized in that the carrying arm 

(7) comprises a hollow profile with a cross-section which 
has three or more sides or is even round, and it can be 

extended either by the telescopic guidance of one or of 
a number of hollow profiles (23, 24) following one after 

the other and being of correspondingly smaller dimensions 
or by identically dimensioned hollow profiles (7, 25) 

being fitted together by means of sockets (26) provided 
inside or outside the hollow profiles. 
Arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the hollow profiles (7, 23, 24, 25, 26) are fixed 

with respect to one another in the direction of travel 
and in the direction counter to this. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or one of the 
following claims, characterized in that components (2, 3) 

for transporting various loads are pushed on the carrying 
arm (7), or the hollow profiles (23, 24, 25) serving for 

extension purposes, such that they can be displaced in a 
stepwise manner and arrested or they are connected 

fixedly to the hollow profiles (7, 23, 24, 25). 
Arrangement according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that components (2, 3) are designed for transporting 

bicycles, skis, sailing or surfing equipment or for 
transporting packaging containers.
