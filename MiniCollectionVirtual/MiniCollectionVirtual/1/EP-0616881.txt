<ABSTRACT>
An optical molding process for obtaining a three-dimensional 
resin model by scanning a surface of a photocurable resin liquid 

held in a photocurable resin liquid tank by a light beam to cure 
the same and successively building up the scanned and cured 

layers on an elevator. When the molding of one constant-height 
section layer is ended and the elevator is made to descend, the 

overflow of the photocurable resin liquid from the photocurable 
resin liquid tank to an overflow tank is temporarily blocked and 

then after the blocking of the overflow is lifted, the next 
constant-height section layer is molded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical molding process 
and an optical molding apparatus which mold a desired resin model 
by scanning and irradiating a photocurable resin such as an 
ultraviolet light curable resin by a light beam, and more 
particularly relates to an optical molding process and an optical 
molding apparatus which quickly returns the level of the liquid 
surface of the photocurable resin liquid contained in the 
photocurable resin liquid tank to a constant level so as to 
shorten the molding time and improve the molding precision. An attempt has been made, for example, to mold a desired 
resin model by scanning the surface of a tank containing an 
ultraviolet light curable resin liquid with an ultraviolet light 
laser, while turning it on and off, so as to cure the same and 
successively building up scanned and cured layers on an elevator. 
This resin model is used as a master model for other products, 
for example, so during molding it is necessary to improve the 
molding precision, the interlayer bonding, and the molding 
efficiency. The conventional optical molding process, as shown in Figure 
1, involved generating an ultraviolet light beam 5 from an 
ultraviolet light laser 4, using an optical system having 
galvanomirrors and shutters etc. to turn the ultraviolet light 
laser on and off and control the scanning direction of the beam,  
 
and while doing so irradiate the surface of the tank 1 containing 
an ultraviolet light curable resin liquid 2. In the tank was 
provided an elevator 8 which blocked the ultraviolet light laser 
and could be made to ascend and descend. The resin liquid present 
between the surface 3 of the resin liquid and the elevator 8 was 
cured by the ultraviolet light laser beam 5. In the first step of the molding process, the elevator 8 is 
made to ascend and the resin liquid 2 present between the resin 
liquid surface 3 and the elevator 8 is cured by the ultraviolet 
light laser beam 5 to form an n-th scanned and cured layer 7a, 
then the elevator 8 is made to descend and the same procedure as 
with the n-th layer is followed to form an (n+1)th scanned and 
cured layer 7b on the n-th scanned and cured layer 7a. The same 
procedure is followed so as to successively build up (hereinafter 
also referred to as "deposit") scanned and cured layers. When the 
final scanned and cured layer finishes being formed, the elevator 
8 is made to ascend and the model 9 is taken out from the resin 
liquid, then final curing is performed by using an ultraviolet 
light
