<ABSTRACT>
A rotary valve having chamfers (26, 39) at the groove edges (31) of its input-shaft (10) which, in conjunction with axially extending troughs (44), form metering edge contours. The chamfers (26, 39) and troughs (44) at the edges (31) of the grooves (18a, 18b) interacting with sleeve slots (19) to reduce valve hiss and linearise the boost characteristic of the valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
Rotary valve for hydraulic power steering with reduced noise and linear boost characteristicTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to rotary valves such as are used in hydraulic power steering gears for vehicles. More particularly the present invention relates to low noise rotary valves having a substantially linear boost characteristic.BACKGROUND ARTSuch rotary valves include an input-shaft which incorporates in its outer periphery a plurality of blind-ended, axially extending grooves separated by lands. Journalled on the input-shaft is a sleeve having in its bore an array of axially extending blind-ended slots matching the grooves in the input-shaft, but in underlap relationship thereto, the slots of one being wider than the lands of the other so defining a set of axially extending orifices which open and close when relative rotation occurs between the input-shaft and the sleeve from a centred position. The magnitude of such rotation is hereinafter referred to as the valve operating angle. The edges of the input-shaft grooves are contoured so as to provide a specific orifice configuration and are referred to as metering edge contours. These orifices are ported as a network such that they form sets of hydraulic Wheatstone bridges which act in parallel to communicate oil between the grooves in the input-shaft and the slots in the sleeve, and hence between an engine driven oil pump, and right-hand and left-hand hydraulic assist cylinder chambers incorporated in the steering gear. Typically, the input-shaft and sleeve are biased towards the centred position by a torsion bar spring. Thus when small input torques are applied to the steering wheel and hence the input-shaft, only a small magnitude of relative rotation occurs between the input-shaft and sleeve and, for such low valve operating angles, little 

 power assistance is provided by the valve. For larger input torques proportionately greater valve operating angles are generated, leading to much greater levels of power assistance. The relationship between the level of power assistance generated in the valve, as a function of input torque, is known as the valve boost characteristic, and is largely determined by the metering edge contours.It is convenient to refer to these metering edge contours as controlling three zones of the boost characteristic, the high pressure contour associated with the parking zone, an intermediate contour associated with the cornering zone, and a central zone associated with straight ahead driving where normally minimum boost

 CLAIMS
1. A rotary valve for a hydraulic power steering gear comprising an input-shaft having in its outer periphery a plurality of axially extending grooves separated by lands, a sleeve journalled on said input-shaft, said sleeve having in its bore an array of axially extending slots matching the grooves in the input-shaft but in underlap relationship thereto, the slots of said sleeve being wider than the lands of said input-shaft so defining a set of axially extending orifices controlling fluid flow within said valve which open and close when relative rotation occurs between the input-shaft and the sleeve from a centred position, spring means urging said input-shaft and said sleeve towards said centred position, at least two edges of said grooves incorporating metering edge contours, at least two said metering edge contours including shallow chamfers aligned parallel to the axis of said input-shaft and inclined inwardly from the outside diameter of said input-shaft towards respective grooves characterised in that said at least two chamfers incorporate axially extending troughs, each trough having a bottom surface and terminating circumferentially in one direction in an axially extending escarpment intersecting said chamfer and terminating circumferentially in the opposite direction at said groove or said chamfer.
2. A rotary valve as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said bottom surface is substantially parallel and concentric to said outside diameter.
3. A rotary valve as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said bottom surface is arcuate.
4. A rotary valve as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the depth of said trough increases towards said escarpment.
5. A rotary valve as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein said bottom surface is recessed and 


 - 22 -
inclined with respect to said chamfer in the region of said circumferential termination in said opposite direction.
6. A rotary valve as claimed in any one of claims 1-5 wherein said trough is axially shorter than said shallow chamf r.
7. A rotary valve as claimed in any one of claims 1-5 wherein said trough extends substantially the same axial length as said shallow chamfer. 8. A rotary valve as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein each said chamfer incorporates said troughs.
9. A rotary valve as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein said trough terminates axially at each end in an oblique termination, said oblique termination being constituted by the convergence of first and second intersecting lines, said first intersecting line being generated by the intersection of said chamfer and the escarpment of said trough, and said second intersecting line being generated by the intersection of said bottom surface of said trough and said chamfer or the edge of said groove thereby effecting a gradual reduction in the circumferential width and radial depth of said trough in the region of said axial termination.
10. A rotary valve as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein said trough is positioned axially symmetrically with respect to said chamfer.
11. A rotary valve as claimed in any one of claims 1-9 wherein said axial centreline of said trough is axially displaced with respect to the axial centreline of said chamfer.
