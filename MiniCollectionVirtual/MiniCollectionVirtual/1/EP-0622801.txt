<ABSTRACT>
In a high density memory, such as a SRAM, DRAM, EPROM or EEPROM, a 
hierarchical bitline configuration is utilized such that a number of local bitlines are 

connected to a master bitline through interface circuitry which connects a local bitline to 
the master bitline. Local select signals, when set to the appropriate voltage level, couple 

a local bitline to the master bitline. In addition to reducing the local bitline capacitance 
that must be driven by memory cells, the hierarchical configuration may provide layout 

area savings as well. 
Interface circuitry is modified to provide voltage and signal gain and/or provide 
isolation between the local bitlines and the master bitlines, thereby reducing the amount 

of capacitance which must be driven by memory cells and the amount of time required 
to develop differential signals on the master bitlines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated 
circuits, including hierarchical bitline memory architecture 
and interface circuitry within the hierarchical bitline memory 
architecture which provides gain and/or isolation 
characteristics. In recent years, high density memories such as SRAMs, DRAMs, EPROMs, and 
EEPROMs have dramatically increased the level of bitline capacitance which must be 
driven by memory cells in the memory array. As high speed memories have increased 
in density, efforts have been made to carefully partition the memory array to reduce the 
burden on the memory cell for driving large bitline capacitances. For example, memory 
arrays have gone to four times the number of columns as rows to reduce bitline 
capacitance. In addition, the rows are sometimes bisected by the sensing and column 
decode circuitry to further reduce bitline capacitance. In spite of the advances made in 
careful partitioning of the memory array, bitline capacitance can still be prohibitively large, 
having an adverse affect on device speed and signal integrity. As a result, better 
methods for reducing the bitline capacitance as seen by memory cells while using 
minimum layout area are needed and appropriate. In a high density memory, such as a SRAM, DRAM, EPROM or EEPROM, a 
hierarchical bitline configuration is utilized such that a number of local bitlines are 
connected to a master bitline through interface circuitry which connects a local bitline to 
the master bitline. Local select signals, when set to the appropriate voltage level, couple 
a local bitline to the master bitline. In addition to reducing the local bitline capacitance 
that must be driven by memory cells, the hierarchical configuration may provide layout 
area savings as well.  Interface circuitry is modified to provide voltage and 
signal gain and/or provide isolation between the local 
bitlines and the master bitlines, thereby reducing the amount 
of capacitance which must be driven by memory cells and the 
amount of time required to develop differential signals on the 
master bitlines. According to a preferred embodiment of the present 
invention there is provided a partitioned memory array, 
comprising a plurality of master bitlines, a plurality of 
local bitlines connected to a plurality of memory cells, a 
plurality of interface circuits, which connects each master 
bitline to at least two of the local bitlines, and a plurality 
of local select signals, each capable of selecting a 
corresponding local bitline to be coupled
