<ABSTRACT>
A butterfly (flap) valve has a flap (6) which is mounted on an actuating shaft (2) and, to open the valve, is initially raised from the valve seat into a position of free movement by rotating the actuating shaft (2), which has at least one eccentric section (4), and is then pivoted into its open position, the flap (6) being mounted on the eccentric section (4) and being moved by at least one driver pin (18) arranged on the eccentric section (4). To enable the butterfly valve to be manufactured with little expense and to enable its actuating shaft (2) to be sealed off without problems, it is envisaged that the actuating shaft (2) should be constructed from two outer shaft parts (11, 12), which can be inserted from inside into bearing apertures in the valve housing (1), and from a central shaft part (13), and that the shaft parts (11, 12, 13) should each carry at their mutually adjoining ends an eccentric-disc half (14/15, 16/17), which are clamped together, trapping respective driver pins (18).
