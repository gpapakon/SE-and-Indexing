<ABSTRACT>
A cover (3) for a furnace body (2) is connected to each of two upper electrodes (16, 17) which extend through 
the portions of the furnace cover (3) which are spaced horizontally from each other by a predetermined distance. 

The upper electrodes (16, 17) have upper conductors (20, 21) thereon, which extend in the directions in which the 
conductors (20,21) are away from the other upper electrodes. Two lower conductors (22,23) are provided so as to 

be connected to a lower electrode (1) and extend in the same direction as the upper conductors (20, 21). Separate 

power source circuits (24, 25) are provided between the extended ends of one set of upper and lower conductors (20, 
22) and between those of the other set of upper and lower conductors (21, 23), and arcs (12a, 12b) occurring between 

the upper and lower electrodes (16, 1; 17, 1) are directed toward the center of the furnace body (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DC arc furnace for melting scrap or pig
iron in the form of cold blocks of the type comprising a furnace shell with a
lower electrode at the bottom thereof, a furnace roof adapted to close the upper
portion of said furnace shelll, two upper electrodes which are horizontally
spaced and extend vertically through said furnace roof, lifting devices for
vertically moving the upper electrodes independently of one another, upper
conductors connected to respective upper electrodes and extending in the
direction away from the remainder of the upper electrodes, the upper electrodes and the upper conductors lying in a common plane, two lower
conductors connected to said lower electrode
and a respective
power source circuit arranged between the ends of each
corresponding pair of upper and lower conductors. Such a furnace is known
from FR-A-2611876.A DC arc furnace as shown in Figure 1 has also been used to melt scrap
material.As shown in Figure 1, a DC arc furnace comprises a furnace shell 2 with
a lower electrode 1 (anode) at its bottom, a furnace roof 3 adapted to close an
upper portion of the furnace shell 2, an upper electrode 4 extending through the
roof 3 and movable vertically, a lower conductor 5 connected to the lower
electrode 1 and extending radially, an upper conductor 6 connected to the upper
electrode 4 and extending radially and a power source circuit 10 including a
transformer 8 and a rectifier 9 both arranged between the extension ends of the
upper and lower conductors 5 and 6 and connected to an AC power source 7.In an operation of melting sscrap or the like material 11, the roof 3 is 
moved upward and removed outside to open the upper portion of the furnace
shell 2. Using a bucket or the like, the material 11 is charged into the furnace
shell 2. Then, the top of the furnace shell 2 is closed with the roof 3 and heavy-current
is excited across the electrodes 1 and 4 by the power source circuit 10.
While arc 12 is generated between the electrodes 1 and 4, the upper electrode 4
is gradually lowered to melt the material 11.However, the conventional DC arc furnace as shown in Figure 1 has a
problem of the arc 12 between the electrodes 1 and 4 being generated in 
a deflected direction.This will be explained more specifically. In the upper and lower
conductors 6 and 5, which are respectively connected to the upper and
lower electrodes 4 and 1 and extend radially, the upper conductor 6 is
arranged to be vertically movable further above the roof 3; whereas the
