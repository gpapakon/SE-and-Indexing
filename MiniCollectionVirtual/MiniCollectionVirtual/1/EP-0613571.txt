<ABSTRACT>
An integrated tunable optical filter comprising a substrate made of a semiconducting material, the substrate (1) comprising a first (2) and a second (3) section, said first section (2) forming a tunable filter having a low selectivity, and said second section (3) forming a selectively reflecting device. First means designed for current injection into said first section (2) are provided, the filter response thereof being shifted in wavelength, and second means designed for current injection into said second section (3) are provided, the reflection spectrum thereof being slightly shifted in wavelength, in such a way that one reflection peak of said reflection spectrum corresponds to that of the filter response of the first section (2), the total filter response having a very narrow bandwidth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an integrated broadly
tunable optical filter designed, in particular, for
advanced WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) applications
as well as for use in spectroscopic testing of
various optical components.Broadly tunable optical filters are key components
in optical communication systems. Two objectives
dominate with such filters. The aims, on the one hand,
are a broad tunable range and, on the other hand, high
spectral selectivity. The planar integrated structures
known hitherto, however, permit only one of these objectives
at a time to be met.A conventional filter structure, known as codirectional
coupler structure, is described in "Broadly
tunable InGaAsP/InP buried rib waveguide vertical coupler
filter" (R.C. Alferness, L.L. Buhl, U. Koren, B.I.
Miller, M.G. Young, T.L. Koch, G.A. Burrus, G. Raybon),
Appl. Phys. Lett. 60(8), 24 February 1992. This conventional
structure consists of two asymmetrical waveguides
having different effective refractive indices. The
optical signal launched into the uppermost waveguide is
launched into the lowermost waveguide and selectively
reflected towards the uppermost waveguide. If the parameters
of the waveguides are chosen carefully, a structure
of this type can act as a selective filter.The advantage of this conventional structure is
the fact that a broad tuning range is provided, but it is
difficult to obtain high spectral selectivity without
constructing a long appliance.On the other hand, a semiconductor optical
structure is also known which can provide high selectivity.
This conventional structure makes use of a
waveguide having a grating grown thereon, that grating of
which is periodically omitted. A structure of this type
has already been used in a tunable laser (V. Jayaraman,
D.A. Cohen, L.A. Coldren, "Demonstration of broadband
tunability in a semiconductor laser using sampled 
gratings", Appl. Phys. Lett 60(19), 11 May 1992).
Nevertheless, a structure of this type has hitherto not
been used in a filter structure.This conventional structure provides a comb-shaped
reflection spectrum. The parameters thereof are the
spacing between the peaks, the spectral bandwidth of
the envelope of the comb spectrum, the peak maximums
and the bandwidth of a reflection peak. The latter is
probably the most important parameter, because it
affects the selectivity of the structure. Most unfortunately,
this parameter too limits the tuning range of
the structure.The object of the present invention is to present
an opitcal filter structure which
