<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of measuring the mass of an aerosol formulation
delivered from a container after activation of a metered dose valve.Drugs for treating respiratory and nasal disorders are frequently administered
in aerosol formulations through the mouth or nose. One widely used method for
dispensing such aerosol drug formulations involves making a suspension formulation
of the drug as a finely divided powder in a liquefied gas known as a propellant.
The suspension is stored in a sealed container capable of withstanding the pressure
required to maintain the propellant as a liquid. The suspension is dispensed
by activation of a dose metering valve affixed to the container.A metering valve may be designed to consistently release a fixed, predetermined
mass of the drug formulation upon each activation. As the suspension is
forced from the container through the dose metering valve by the high vapor pressure
of the propellant, the propellant rapidly vaporizes, i.e., boils, leaving a fast
moving cloud of very fine particles of the drug formulation. This cloud is usually directed
into the nose or mouth of the patient by a channeling device, e.g., a cylinder
like or cone-like passage, with one of its ends attached to the outlet of the pressurized
container, and the other end inserted in the mouth or nose of the patient.
Concurrently with the activation of the aerosol dose metering valve, the patient inhales
the drug formulation particles into the lungs or nasal cavity. Systems for
dispensing drugs in this way are known as "metered dose inhalers" (MDI's). See
Peter Byron, Respiratory Drug Delivery, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL 1990 for a
general background on this form of therapy.Patients often rely on medication delivered by MDI's for rapid treatment of
respiratory disorders which are debilitating and, in some cases, even life threatening.
Therefore, it is essential that the prescribed dose of aerosol medication delivered
to the patient consistently meet the specifications claimed by the manufacturer
and comply with the requirements set forth by drug regulatory authorities
such as the FDA. Thus, testing of MDI units for proper drug delivery by the metering
dose valve is a part of the manufacturer's quality assurance procedure.One conventional method to test delivery of MDI's consists of taring each
MDI and measuring the weight lost after the delivery of one dose. This method is 
accurate and adequate for testing a small number of samples. However, it is
poorly suited for high speed production and

<CLAIMS>
A method of measuring the mass of a volatile liquid in the form of an aerosol
which comprises, 1) passing said aerosol over a heat loss measuring device, 2)

measuring the amount of heat loss due to vaporization of said aerosol and 3) correlating
said measurement to heat loss measurements of known masses of said

liquid with said device under essentially identical conditions .
The method of Claim 1 wherein the volatile liquid is an aerosol propellant.
The method of Claim 2, wherein said aerosol propellant is trichloromonofluoromethane,
dichlorodifluoromethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, heptafluoropropane,

tetrachlorofluoroethane, butane, isobutane or propane.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the heat loss measuring device is a hot film or
hot wire anomometer.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the volatile liquid is discharged from an aerosol
container equipped with a metering dose valve.
A method of quality assurance in the manufacturing of metered dose inhalers
comprising:


a) determining the mass of the output of a sample metered dose inhaler by
the method of measuring the mass of a volatile liquid in the form of an aerosol

comprising, 1) passing said aerosol over a heat loss measuring device, 2)
measuring the amount of heat loss due to vaporization of said aerosol and 3)

correlating said measurement to heat loss measurements of known masses of
said liquid with said device under essentially identical conditions and
b) rejecting those metered dose inhalers which have output below or above a
predetermined range of tolerance.
The method of Claim 6 wherein said metered dose inhalers contain an aerosol
formulation of albuterol (salbutamol), salmeterol, amiloride, fluticasone propionate

or beclomethasone dipropionate.
