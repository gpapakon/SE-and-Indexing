<ABSTRACT>
A mould element (1), for producing a permanent pattern on a rubber tread layer, has one or more parts (2) for moulding a counter-relief pattern portion, the area of each counter-relief moulding part (2) projected on a plane perpendicular to the demoulding direction during at least part of the demoulding operation being less than the corresponding area in the moulding position so that demoulding of the mould element is facilitated. Also claimed is part of a mould used for moulding part of a tread layer and comprising one or more projecting mould elements.

<CLAIMS>
A moulding element (1, 21, 33, 40, 50, 70, 80, 90, 100, 105, 110, 120,
130) intended to equip a mould for moulding a tread made of rubber mix, said

element moulding a non-demouldable motif in the thickness of said tread and
comprising at least one part (2, 27, 28, 35, 36, 41, 42, 55, 71, 72, 82, 94, 102,

107, 114, 122, 131) for moulding an undercut motif part, said moulding element
having a demoulding direction, the moulding element (1, 21, 33, 40, 50, 70, 80,

90, 100, 105, 110, 120, 130) being 
characterised in that
, during at least part of
the demoulding operation, the projected surface of each part (2, 27, 28, 35 , 36,

41, 42, 55, 71, 72, 82, 94, 102, 107, 114, 122, 131) moulding an undercut motif
on a plane perpendicular to the demoulding direction is less than the projected

surface of the same part in the moulding position on the same plane, so as to
facilitate demoulding of said moulding element.
A moulding element (1, 21, 33, 40, 50, 70, 80, 90) according to Claim 1,


characterised in that
 it comprises at least two parts [(2, 3), (22, 27, 28), (34, 35,
36), (41, 42, 43), (51, 55), (71, 72, 77), (81, 82), (91, 92)]
, one of said parts being
intended to mould part of the undercut motif, the two parts [(2, 3), (22, 27, 28),

(34, 35, 36), (41, 42, 43), (51, 55), (71, 72, 77), (81, 82), (91, 92)] being

assembled together by means of at least one pivot pin (13, 29, 30, 37, 38, 44,
66, 67, 78, 79, 85, 93), said pivot pin(s) permitting rotation of one part relative to

the other under the action of the demoulding forces to permit a reduction in the
projected surface on a plane perpendicular to the demoulding direction of each

part (2, 27, 28, 35, 36, 41, 42, 55, 71, 72, 82, 94) moulding part of the undercut
motif.
A moulding element (80, 90) according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,

characterised in that
 said moulding element comprises at least two stable
moulding configurations each moulding a motif having at least one undercut motif

part, any one of said configurations possibly being selected before moulding said
motif. 
A moulding element (100, 105, 110, 120,130) according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 at least one part (102, 107, 114, 122, 131) of said element
intended for moulding an undercut motif part is elastically deformable under the

action of the demoulding forces.
A moulding element (100) according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the
part intended for moulding an undercut motif part is an elastic thin blade (103)

folded over on itself so as to form, viewed in cross-section, a loop (104).
A moulding element (120, 130) according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that

the part intended for moulding an undercut motif part is arranged to form a tube
(122, 131).
A moulding element (120, 130) according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that

the tube (122, 131) moulding an undercut motif part is filled with a different
material from the material forming said tube, said filling material having an

elasticity modulus at most equal to 50% of the modulus of the material forming
the tube.
A moulding element (120, 130) according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that

the tube (122, 131) moulding an undercut motif part is connected to a device for
supplying a filling fluid under pressure, emptying means possibly being provided

to permit demoulding, the fluid being eliminated from the tube by the pressure
forces exerted by the moulded elastomeric material.
A moulding element (120, 130) according to any one of Claims 6 to 8,

characterised in that
 the tube (122, 131) moulding an undercut motif part is
reinforced by a reinforcement material to limit the deformation resulting from the

elongation of the material forming the tube.
A part of a mould having a moulding surface for moulding part of a tread,
said mould part comprising at least one moulding element protruding from the

moulding surface of the mould for moulding a motif in the thickness of the tread,
said moulding element being 
characterised in that
 part at least of said moulding 
element is mounted to pivot on said mould part about a pivot pin parallel to the

moulding surface in the moulding position to permit rotation of said part of the
moulding element during demoulding and 
in that
 said moulding element
comprises at least one moulding configuration.
A part of a mould having a moulding surface for moulding part of a tread,
said mould part comprising at least one moulding element according to any one

of Claims 1 to 9, this moulding element protruding from the moulding surface of
the mould for moulding a motif in the thickness of the tread.
