<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an electric slicer of the gravity ham-slicer type, comprising a frame 
(11), a circular blade (14) driven by an electric motor, an inclined support plate (12), and a mobile 

carrier (30) consisting of an inclined support base (33) equipped, on one side, with a support rim 
(36) and, on the other side, with a pivoting pusher-plate (40), mounted to be able to slide freely 

on its shaft (39) between two associated stops. 
The electric slicer (10) includes a safety device (100) associated with the pusher-plate (40) 
to prevent slicing in the event of excessive raising of this pusher-plate, the said device being 

functionally linked to the electric motor driving the blade to cut out this motor as soon as the 
pusher-plate (40) is pivoted through an angle exceeding a pre-determined threshold value, from 

its rest position on the support base (33), whatever the axial position of the said pusher-plate (40) 
on its shaft (39).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns electric food slicers, and more especially electric slicers 
of the gravity ham-slicer type. This type of equipment is generally used in delicatessens or butchers shops of all sizes, for 
cutting into slices products such as hams, meats, sausages, saveloys, etc. The state of the art is illustrated for example by Patent Applications EP-A-0 115787, 
FR-A-2 249 749, EP-A-0 149 473, EP-A-0 115 788, EP-A-0 115 785, EP-A-0 248 354, EP-A-0 
1 16 294. Conventional slicers comprise a frame, a circular blade with an inclined axis and with the 
blade covered by a blade-cover plate allowing only a part of the cutting edge to appear and an 
electric motor for driving the blade. An inclined support plate is in addition mounted on the slicer 
frame, being directly adjacent to the cutting edge of the blade; this support plate is generally 
adjustable in position perpendicular to its plane by an associated adjuster which the user operates 
to obtain the desired slice thickness. A mobile carrier is finally mounted on the frame so that it can 
be moved manually in a direction which is parallel to the plane of the blade, this carrier being 
generally composed of an inclined support base equipped, on one side, with a support rim, and 
on the other side, with a pivoting pusher-plate, mounted to be able to slide freely on its shaft 
between two associated stops.  The product to be cut is thus held in a V-shaped chute (formed by the support base and 
the support rim of the mobile carrier), which is inclined towards the support plate and the 
blade-cover plate against which the product to be cut naturally rests, in accordance with the name 
"gravity ham-slicer". The manual movement of the mobile carrier then allows the product to be 
sliced over its whole width, the slice falling onto a delivery plate on the frame, the user performing 
as many forward and return operations as slices one required. When the product to be cut is presented in the form of a large block (meat or ham, for 
example), the user uses the pusher-plate, of which the active face has spikes preventing any 
unintended sliding of the product during slicing. After placing the block to be cut on the support 
base, against the support rim, the block is pushed against the inclined support plate (often called 
meat-carrying plate), the pusher-plate is then lowered (which was raised for placing the block), 
and pushed against the block: all these operations must be performed before starting the motor 
driving the circular blade. On the
