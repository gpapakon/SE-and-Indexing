<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for driving switching elements disposed in a chain form or in a matrix form, which has at most seven transistors (Tn1, Tn2, Tn3, Tn4, Tn5, Tn6, Tn7) and at most two capacitances (Cn1, Cnb) and is controlled by four clock signals ( phi 1,  phi 2,  phi 3,  phi 4), phase-shifted by 90@ with respect to one another, in order to achieve as high a fabrication yield as possible. The transistors (Tn5, Tn6, Tn7) together with a bootstrap capacitance (Cnb) form an output stage (12). At least one further transistor forms a charging and discharging stage (II) for the bootstrap capacitance.
