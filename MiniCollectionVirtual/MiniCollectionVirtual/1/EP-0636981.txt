<ABSTRACT>
A system which is intended for wake-up restores and wakes up information 
necessary for resuming a task from a detachable external storage device 

regardless of whether or not the system has executed hibernation. 
Historical information showing that hibernation was executed in a system 
including the external storage device is installed in a predetermined 

area of an external storage device. The wake-up system checks the 
history information for executing wake-up (step 1101). Furthermore, the 

external storage device stores control information including system 
configuration information when the task is suspended. The wake-up 

system compares stored system configuration information with its own 
configuration information (step 1102). When the configuration 

information does not agree, the restoration of information to the main 
memory from the external storage device is rejected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to information processing systems that 
operate with a low power consumption, and more particularly to a 
portable information processing system such as a notebook computer. As a result of recent technological innovation, small-size and light-weight 
portable computers have become common. When such portable 
computers are used outdoors, electric power is supplied to them with 
batteries. However batteries mounted on portable computers are 
restricted to small-size batteries. Thus the period for which personal 
computers can be operated without recharging the batteries is short. 
Consequently various kind of facilities or devices are provided for 
reducing the consumption of power in many portable computers. A suspend/resume function is one of such facilities. When the 
suspend/resume function operates, the computer enters into a suspend 
mode. This may be in response to a situation such as no activity of an 
I/O device being detected for a certain time. In the suspend mode all 
tasks are suspended, and the main memory saves data required later for 
resuming the tasks. In the suspend mode, the main memory and the video 
memory (VRAM) are powered on, but CPU or the like are powered off. 
However, portable computers have a drawback in that the power of 
batteries are consumed when the suspend mode continues for a very long 
time with only the support of the suspend/resume function. This can 
result in the contents of the memory and the VRAM being erased. Therefore portable computers which are supported with hibernation mode, 
such as the LTE Lite/25 manufactured by Compaq Company (Compaq and LTE 
are registered trademarks of Compaq Computer Corporation), have been 
proposed and marketed. When hibernation mode is enabled, the computer 
enters a low battery-use state. Otherwise, when the suspend mode  
 
continues for a certain time, the computers enter hibernation mode after 
saving onto the hard disk all the data required later for resuming the 
task. In hibernation mode, the whole system, including the memory and 
the VRAM, is powered off. When users power on the system later, the 
data stored in the hard disk is restored in the memory and the VRAM and 
the tasks which had been suspended are automatically resumed. The 
series of operation accompanying power-on is also referred to as wake-up. In recent years detachable hard disk devices have come to be installed 
on computers. However, no art is known that enables carrying a 
detachable hard disk device in which a task is
