<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic vibrator (1) has a single natural 
frequency for radiating ultrasonic energy into a 

cleaning solution (4) to clean and deburr workpieces 
that are immersed in the cleaning solution. A plurality 

of oscillating signals (a,b,c) having respective 
different frequencies which are integral multiples of 

the natural frequency of the ultrasonic vibrator are 
generated, and successively outputted for respective 

periods of time thereby to generate a composite signal 
which is composed of a time series of the oscillating 

signals. The composite signal is applied as a drive 
signal to the ultrasonic vibrator to oscillate the 

ultrasonic vibrator. The oscillating signals may be 
outputted successively for said respective periods of 

time or intermittently with quiescent periods inserted 
therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of oscillating 
an ultrasonic vibrator for use in ultrasonically 
cleaning (including deburring) workpieces immersed in a 
cleaning solution. For ultrasonically cleaning workpieces immersed in 
a cleaning solution in a cleaning tank, it has been customary 
to apply a periodic voltage signal to an ultrasonic vibrator 
having a piezoelectric element, the periodic voltage signal 
having a frequency equal to the natural frequency of the ultrasonic 
vibrator, to oscillate the ultrasonic vibrator at 
its natural frequency for thereby radiating an ultrasonic energy 
into the cleaning solution. The radiated ultrasonic energy 
produces a cavitation in the cleaning solution, which 
generates shock waves to clean and deburr the workpieces immersed 
in the cleaning solution. It is generally known that the cavitation in the 
cleaning solution appears at a depth depending on the frequency 
of the radiated ultrasonic energy, i.e., the natural 
frequency (resonant frequency) of the piezoelectric element 
of the ultrasonic vibrator. More specifically, when the ultrasonic 
energy is radiated from the bottom of the cleaning  
 
tank toward the surface level of the cleaning solution in the 
cleaning tank, the cavitation is produced intensively at a 
depth equal to a quarter wavelength, and also at depths positioned 
successively at half wavelength intervals from that 
depth toward the bottom of the cleaning tank. For uniformly cleaning and deburring the workpieces 
immersed in the cleaning solution, it is preferable to generate 
the cavitation uniformly in the cleaning solution without 
being dispersed in the cleaning solution. To generate the 
cavitation uniformly in the cleaning solution, it is desirable 
to radiate the ultrasonic energy at a higher frequency. 
It is also generally known that the higher the frequency of 
the radiated ultrasonic energy, the more the ultrasonic energy 
is attenuated in the cleaning solution, resulting in a 
lowered cavitation effect. For effective cleaning or deburring 
of the workpieces, therefore, it is preferable to radiate 
the ultrasonic energy at a lower frequency. Since the 
generation and effect of the cavitation vary depending on the 
frequency of the ultrasonic energy, the frequency of the ultrasonic 
energy should be selected in view of the purpose for 
which the workpieces are to be cleaned and the degree to 
which the workpieces are to be cleaned. For example, if a 
stronger cleaning capability is desirable, then the ultrasonic 
energy
