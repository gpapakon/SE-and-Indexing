<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems for variably 
controlling internal combustion engine intake and exhaust 
valves. More specifically, it relates to engine valve 
systems of the type in which hydraulic pressure of a 
pressurised fluid is used through action of solenoid valves 
to control the engine valves motion. The enhancement of engine performance to be attained by 
being able to vary the acceleration, velocity and travel 
time of the intake and exhaust valves in an engine is well 
known and appreciated in the art. However, the technology 
for providing a straight-forward, relatively inexpensive and 
highly reliable system has not been forthcoming. Increased 
use and reliance on micro electronic control systems for 
automotive vehicles and increased confidence in hydraulic as 
opposed to mechanical systems is now making substantial 
progress possible. In the area of intake and exhaust engine 
valves, prior development has been largely dependent upon 
sophisticated mechanical systems such as mechanically 
varying phase shift and other aspects of valve timing. 
increased use of multiple valve engines has also been 
promoted. The use or adoption of hydraulically controlled engine 
valves has been quite slow. Examples of known systems 
include those as shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,915,052; 
3,240,191; 3,361,121; 3,534,718; 3,926,159; 3,963,006; and 
4,200,067. In some instances, such as shown in U.S. Patent 
No. 3,361,121 the poppet valve is maintained in a closed 
position by a mechanical coil spring, yet utilises a 
hydraulic actuator to bias the valves in the open position. 
Several of the aforementioned patents also disclose the use 
of a rotary distributor valve to alternately couple the 
hydraulic actuator ports to a source of pressurised fluid, 
such as shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,915,052 and 4,200,067. 
In certain of the aforementioned patents, it is also shown 
that the hydraulic fluid system is used to both open and  
 
close the engine valve, such feature being shown in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 2,915,052 and 3,963,006. However, none of the aforementioned systems provide a 
variable engine valve control system offering the 
simplicity, reliability, flexibility and efficiency believed 
necessary for use in the high production, high performance 
automotive engines being produced today and those that will 
be required in the near future. The Applicants have earlier proposed in EP-A-420 443 an 
engine valve control system of an internal combustion engine

An engine valve control system of an internal 
combustion engine in which the valve stroke is controlled by 

varying timing and duration of electric signals sent to 
individually dedicated engine valve controlling means, the 

system comprising: 

a controller programmed to send variable electric

correction signal duration (510) 
means (504) for generating a basic signal duration 
determined by the controller as a function of engine 

operating conditions and being equal for all engine intake 
valves and equal for all engine exhaust valves; and 
means (500,502) for generating a correction signal 
predetermined for each of the engine valve controlling means 

as a measure of the extent the performance of each engine 
valve controlling means varies from a predetermined 

standard, said correction signal generating means being 
operative in timed sequence to supply to the controller said 

predetermined correction signal just prior to a respective 
engine valve controlling means being activated, 
said correction signal generating means (500,502) 
comprising: 
a rotatable member (502) having individual codings (406) 
thereon in spaced sequence, each coding representing a 

specific engine valve controlling means and containing 
information on the correction signal required by the said 

specific engine valve controlling means; and 
a sensor (500) installed in proximity of the said 
rotatable member, said sensor being capable of reading the 

information contained in each coding on the rotatable member 
as it passes the sensor and transmitting said reading as a 

correction signal to said controller. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, wherein each said 
coding is in the form of a tag (406-1 to 406-4) and each tag 

is affixed to said rotatable member (502); the system 
further including:
 
   means for rotating said rotatable member (502) during 

engine operation with an angular velocity equal to half the 
crankshaft velocity on a four-stroke engine and equal to 

crankshaft velocity on a two-stroke engine, whereby said 
sensor (500) will read the information on individual tags 

(406) successively passing the proximity of the sensor (500) 
and transmit a respective correction signal to the 

controller, the location of individual tags on said 
rotatable member being such that the information on each tag 

(406) is read and sent to the control system just before the 
engine valve controlling means for which the tag was coded 

must be actuated.

pressure valves for selectively coupling the enclosed 

cavities to the high pressure and low pressure sources to 
oscillate each poppet valve in timed relation to engine 

operation, wherein the net fluid flow between the high 
pressure and low pressure sources is substantially less than 

the volume swept by the piston; 
said control means including means for controlling (i) 
the motion of each said poppet valve (10) by varying the 

timing and duration of the said control means actuation, 
(ii) the timing of the valve opening and closing motions of 

each poppet valve by varying the timing of said control 
means actuation, and (iii) the stroke of each said poppet 

valve by varying the duration of said control means
