<ABSTRACT>
A pace responsive cardiac pacemaker for providing an optimized pacing rate of stimulation pulses as a function of at least one selected rate control parameter. Each rate control parameter has a value which varies as a function of changes in a patient's physiologic demand and includes a sensor system for sensing the rate control parameter value and for providing a sensor output representative thereof. The cardiac pacemaker also includes a rate response defining means for deriving desired pacing rates as a function of the sensor output, an achievement monitoring means that has a predetermined achievement criterion (primary criterion), for monitoring the relationship between the derived pacing rates and the achievement criterion over an optimization period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to cardiac 
pacemakers, and more particularly, pertains to cardiac 
pacemakers of the type which measure physiologic or metabolic 
requirements and vary the rate of the pacemaker in accordance 
therewith. Early cardiac pacemakers provided a fixed-rate 
stimulation pulse generator that could be reset on demand by 
sensed atrial and/or ventricular depolarization. Modern 
pacemakers include complex stimulation pulse generators, sense 
amplifiers and leads which can be configured or programmed to 
operate in single or dual chamber modes of operation, 
delivering pacing stimuli to the atrium and/or ventricle at 
fixed rates or rates that vary between an upper rate limit and 
a lower rate limit. In recent years, single and dual chamber pacemakers have 
been developed which measure rate control parameters (RCP's) 
which are directly or indirectly related to metabolic 
requirements (e.g., demand for oxygenated blood) and vary the 
pacing rate in response to such measured RCP's. Such RCP's 
include, for example, QT interval evoked response, physical 
activity of the body, right ventricular blood pressure and the 
change of right ventricular blood pressure over time, venous 
blood temperature, venous blood oxygen saturation, respiration 
rate, minute ventilation, and various pre and post-systolic 
time intervals measured by impedance or pressure sensing 
within the right ventricle of the heart. Such RCP-measuring, 
sensor-driven pacemakers have been developed for the purpose 
of restoring rate response to exercise or other physiological  
 
stresses in patients lacking the ability to increase rate 
adequately by exertion. In general, a rate responsive pacemaker includes a sensor 
which produces a sensor output representative of a selected 
RCP, such sensor output varying between a maximum sensor 
output level and a minimum sensor output level ("Sensor 
Output"). The pacemaker provides a pacing ("Pacing Rate") 
which typically varies as a linear or monotonic function ("f") 
of the sensor output between a selectable lower pacing rate 
("Lower Rate") and upper pacing rate ("Upper Rate"). Function 
f has a selectable slope (i.e., Pacing Rate change / Sensor 
Output change) adjustable by means of an external programmer 
in conjunction with the Lower and Upper Rates. Thus, the 
Pacing Rate typically provided is equal to the pre-selected 
Lower Rate plus an increment which is a function of the 
measured Sensor Output, as follows: 
Pacing Rate = Lower Rate + f (Sensor Output). A
