<DESCRIPTION>
 TRITYL MONITOR FOR AUTOMATED POLYNUCLEOTIDE SYNTHESISThe present invention relates generally to the synthesis of polynucleotides, and more particularly, to automated techniques for solid phase synthesis of polynucleotides.Background The development of reliable and convenient methods for solid phase synthesis of polynucleotides has led to many advances in molecular biology and related fields, e.g. Itakura, Science, Vol. 209, pgs. 1401-1405 (1980); Caruthers, Science, Vol. 230, pgs 281 -285 (1985); Narang, ed., Synthesis and Applications of DNA and RNA (Academic Press, New York, 1987); and Eckstein, ed., Oligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach (IRL Press, Oxford, 1991). As the use of synthetic polynucleotides has increased, the demand for even greater convenience in the preparation of pure, ready-to-use polynucleotides has also increased. This demand has stimulated the development of many improvements in the solid phase chemistry, e.g. Sinha et al, Nucleic Acids Research. Vol. 12, pgs. 4539-4557 (1984)(beta- cyanoethyl in phosphoramidite chemistries); Froehler et al, Tetrahedron Letters. Vol. 27, pgs. 469-472 (1986)(H-phosphonate chemistry); Germann et al, Anal. Biochem.. Vol. 165, pgs. 399-405 (1987); and Ikuta et al, Anal. Chem.. Vol. 56, pgs. 2253- 2256 (1984)(rapid purification of synthetic oligonucleotides by way of trityl moieties); Molko et al, U.S. patent 4,980,460 (improved base-labile acyl protection groups for exocyclic amines), Brill et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc, Vol. 111 , pg. 2321 (1989)(nucleoside phosphorothioamidite monomers for synthesizing oligonucleotide phosphorodithioates), Stec et al, PCT Intern'l. patent appl. US91/01010, and Beaucage et al, U.S. patent 5,003,097 (more efficient sufurizing agents for synthesis of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and -dithioates), and the like. An important aspect of automated procedures for oligonucleotide synthesis is the monitoring of coupling yields during synthesis. Such monitoring not only provides an initial estimate of the purity and yield of the oligonucleotide end product, but also permits one to terminate synthesis if one or more coupling yields are unacceptably 

 low, thereby saving the cost of the reagents that otherwise would have been wasted were the synthesis to continue. On currently available synthesizers, such monitoring is typically carried out "off line" by collecting waste stream samples after the 5'- hydroxyl deprotection step, which releases a trityl cation into a mildly acidic deprotection reagent, usually

We claim:
1. in a method for synthesizing a polynucleotide wherein (i) a correct-sequence chain is attached to a solid phase support in a synthesis chamber, (ii) a nucleoside monomer having a reactive functionality protected by a trityl moiety is coupled to the correct-sequence chain to form a trityl-protected correct-sequence chain, and (iii) the trityl moiety is cleaved from the correct-sequence chain by a deprotection reagent to form a deprotection waste mixture, an improvement comprising the steps of : flushing the synthesis chamber prior to cleaving the trityl moiety from the correct-sequence chain to remove conductive reagents and/or products; and measuring the conductivity of the deprotection waste stream after cleaving the trityl moiety from the correct-sequence chain.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein said step of measuring includes: providing a first electrode and a second electrode such that said deprotection waste mixture forms a conductive pathway between the first and second electrodes when said deprotection waste mixture is expelled from said synthesis chamber; and establishing a voltage between the first electrode and the second electrode, the voltage having a polarity with respect to the first and second electrodes.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein said step of measuring further includes alternating the polarity of the voltage between said first and second electrodes to prevent the accumulation of conductance-altering ions at either said first or second electrodes.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein said step of measuring includes a timed integration of said conductivity between said first and second electrodes such that the timed integration occurs within the interval of between said cleavage of the trityl moiety and said coupling of said nucleoside monomer.
5. An apparatus for synthesizing a polynucleotide of a predetermined sequence, the apparatus comprising: a solid phase support in a synthesis chamber, the solid phase support having 


a trityl-protected correct-sequence chain attached; one or more reactant reservoirs containing trityl-protected nucleoside monomers; one or more first reagent reservoirs containing synthesis reagents for attaching the trityl-protected nucleoside monomers to the trityl-protected correct- sequence chain after a trityl moiety of the trityl-protected correct-sequence chain has been cleaved, the synthesis reagents including a deprotection reagent for cleaving the trityl moiety from the trityl-protected correct-sequence chain; a conductivity cell capable of holding a deprotection waste mixture formed after cleavage of the trityl moiety from the trityl-protected correct-sequence chain, the conductivity cell comprising a first electrode and a second electrode disposed within the conductivity cell so that the deprotection waste mixture is capable of forming a conductive pathway between the first and second electrodes; means for establishing a voltage between the first electrode and the second electrode so that the conductance and/or the resistivity of the deprotection waste mixture can be measured; and fluid transfer means for transferring trityl-protected nucleoside monomers from the one or more reactant reservoirs to the synthesis chamber, for transferring synthesis reagents to the synthesis cham.ber, and for transferring the deprotection waste mixture from the synthesis chamber to the conductivity cell so that the polynucleotide of the predetermined sequence is synthesized.
6. The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said one or more first reagent reservoirs further include a flushing reagent for removing conductive reagents and/or products from said synthesis chamber.
7. The apparatus of claim 6 wherein said means for establishing a voltage between said first electrode and said second electrode establishes a voltage having a polarity with respect to said first and second electrodes and includes means for reversing the polarity of the voltage between said first and second electrodes.
