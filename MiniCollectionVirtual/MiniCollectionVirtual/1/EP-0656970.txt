<ABSTRACT>
Tissue papers, in particular pattern densified tissue papers, having an enhanced tactile sense of softness when treated with certain nonionic softeners are disclosed. These nonionic softeners are biodegradable and comprise sorbitan esters, ethoxylated/propoxylated versions of these sorbitan esters, or mixtures thereof. The softener is typically applied from an aqueous dispersion or solution thereof to at least one surface of the dry tissue paper web.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to tissue papers, in particular 
pattern densified tissue papers, having an enhanced tactile 
sense of softness. This application particularly relates to 
tissue papers treated with certain nonionic softeners that are 
biodegradable. Paper webs or sheets, sometimes called tissue or paper 
tissue webs or sheets, find extensive use in modern society. 
These include such staple items as paper towels, facial 
tissues and sanitary (or toilet) tissues. These paper 
products can have various desirable properties, including wet 
and dry tensile strength, absorbency for aqueous fluids (e.g., 
wettability), low lint properties, desirable bulk, and 
softness. The particular challenge in papermaking has been to 
appropriately balance these various properties to provide 
superior tissue paper. Although somewhat desirable for towel products, softness 
is a particularly important property for facial and toilet 
tissues. Softness is the tactile sensation perceived by the 
consumer who holds a particular paper product, rubs it across 
the skin, and crumples it within the hand. Such tactile 
perceivable softness can be characterized by, but is not 
limited to, friction, flexibility, and smoothness, as well as 
subjective descriptors, such as a feeling like velvet, silk or 
flannel. This tactile sensation is a combination of several 
physical properties, including the flexibility or stiffness of  
 
the sheet of paper, as well as the texture of the surface of 
the paper. Stiffness of paper is typically affected by efforts to 
increase the dry and/or wet tensile strength of the web. 
Increases in dry tensile strength can be achieved either by 
mechanical processes to insure adequate formation of hydrogen 
bonding between the hydroxyl groups of adjacent papermaking 
fibers, or by the inclusion of certain dry strength additives. 
Wet strength is typically enhanced by the inclusion of certain 
wet strength resins, that, being typically cationic, are 
easily deposited on and retained by the anionic carboxyl 
groups of the papermaking fibers. However, the use of both 
mechanical and chemical means to improve dry and wet tensile 
strength can also result in stiffer, harsher feeling, less 
soft tissue papers. Certain chemical additives, commonly referred to as 
debonding agents, can be added to papermaking fibers to 
interfere with the natural fiber-to-fiber bonding that occurs 
during sheet formation and drying, and thus lead to softer 
papers. These debonding agents are typically cationic and 
have
