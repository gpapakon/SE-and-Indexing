<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a sensor for identifying gases and/or determining the concentrations of gases in mixtures, in particular in exhaust gases from internal-combustion engines. The sensor has an oxygen pump cell (20) and a sensor element (30) with a sensitive zone. The pump cell (20) and the sensor element (30) are disposed remote from each other in such a way that each is located in a different temperature zone when the sensor is operating. To this end, the pump cell (20) is connected to the sensor element (30) by a diffusion path (28) along which the oxygen pumped by the pump cell (20) passes to the sensor element (30), the sensor element (30) being disposed with respect to the pump cell (20) and the diffusion path (28), and the pump cell (20) designed, in such a way that there is an excess of oxygen at the sensitive zone of the sensor element (30).
