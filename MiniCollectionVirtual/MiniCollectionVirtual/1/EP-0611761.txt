<ABSTRACT>
A method of recovering optically active epoxy alcohols from an 
asymmetric epoxidation reaction mixture by inhibiting the epoxidation 

catalyst with a polyalcohol and/or reducing the organic hydroperoxide 
with a sulfur (II), sulfur (III) or phosphorus (III) compound, 

followed by azeotropic distillation of the epoxy alcohol. The process is 
also suitable for combination with sulfonylation of the epoxy alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to methods for recovering optically
active glycidol and related 2,3-epoxy alcohols in purified form
from asymmetric epoxidation reaction mixtures.Optically active (non-racemic) epoxy alcohols such as (R)-and
(S)- glycidol are extremely useful and versatile starting
materials and intermediates in the synthesis of chiral natural
products and natural product analogues or derivatives. Many such
optically active products derived from chiral epoxy alcohols have
a high physiological activity and thus are of great interest in
the pharmaceutical field. The synthetic utility of non-racemic
epoxy alcohols has been extensively reviewed in Hanson, Chemical
Reviews 91(4), 437-473 (1991).Recently, the preparation of optically active epoxy alcohols
from inexpensive racemic starting materials such as allylic
alcohols has become feasible on a commercial scale due to the
development of an asymmetric epoxidation method by Dr. K. Barry
Sharpless and co-workers wherein an allylic alcohol is reacted
with an organic hydroperoxide in the presence of a
titanium/chiral carbinol complex catalyst. While this method
affords good yields of epoxy alcohol having high optical purity,
recovery of the epoxy alcohol from the crude epoxidation reaction 
mixture is not simple due to the number of different substances
present (typically, epoxy alcohol, unreacted allylic alcohol,
unreacted hydroperoxide, organic solvent, the alcohol derived
from reduction of the hydroperoxide during epoxidation, and
catalyst are all present). In addition, glycidol and related
compounds are notoriously unstable and reactive. Significant
losses due to polymerization, ring-opening (e.g., hydrolysis or
alcoholysis), acid-catalyzed or thermal decomposition, and the
like are often encountered during purification of these
substances.The development of improved methods whereby optically active
glycidol or the like may be isolated from an asymmetric
epoxidation reaction mixture in high yield with minimal loss of
optical purity would therefore be of considerable value.An article in J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 109, No. 19 (1987)
at 5675 - 5779 discusses the asymmetric epoxidation of allylic
alcohols and refers on page 5767 to the use of dimethyl
sulfide and triphenyl phosphine for catalyst neutralisation
prior to product recovery by distillation. Page 5773 mentions
how excess oxidant (hydroperoxide) may be removed by
azeotropic distillation with toluene. There is, however, no
proposal to form an azeotrope of the epoxy alcohol in the
recovery
