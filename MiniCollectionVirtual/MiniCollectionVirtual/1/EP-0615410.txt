<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device (2) which is intended and adapted to be held in a space defined between the frontal surfaces of the teeth and the inner surfaces of the lips of a user. The device includes a central region (20) provided with one or more holes (21-24) whose cross-section is adapted so that the airflow drawn through said holes (inhalation) will meet with a resistance which corresponds to, or essentially corresponds to, the resistance to the airflow through a cigarette, a cigar, a pipe or the like. The perforated central part (20) is comprised of a plastic material or like material, and a peripheral part (25) which surrounds the central part either completely or partially is comprised of a material which is dissolved by saliva. This saliva-dissolved material (25) contains an adapted proportion of nicotine.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Device for curing smoke addiction.TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a device which is intended and adapted to be enclosed by a space defined between the frontal surfaces of the teeth and the inner surfaces of the lips of a user.The inventive device is intended to assist people who suffer from a smoking or tobacco dependency and who wish consciously to take measures to overcome their smoking dependency.More specifically, the inventive device is intended to function as an auxiliary for people who do not have sufficient willpower to stop smoking immediately, but who wish to reduce their smoking habit successively, at their own pace.KNOWN PRIOR ARTIngrained smokers who wish to overcome a pronounced craving to smoke have at least three mutually indepen¬ dent habits and cravings to overcome:Habit of movementWhen smoking, the smoker will move his/her hands in a pattern which has become habitual and which is therefore normally deeply rooted. Normally, there is a certain ceremonial touch over the movement pattern of the hands of a smoker as he/she smokes, for instance the manner in which a cigarette, cigar, pipe or like device is held and moved. 

 The desire to smokeIn the act of smoking, the air or gas which passes through the cigarette, etc., as the smoker draws on the cigarette meets a certain resistance, the magnitude of which depends on the flow rate of the inhalation air. Consequently, there exists an ingrained feeling that the inhalation air does not constantly obtain free passage through the pharynx and down into the lungs.Craving for nicotineFinally, as a result of the smoke generated and the inhalation of this smoke, there is delivered to the smoker a highly habit-forming, stimulating poison in the form of nicotine.There are known to the art several different devices and proposals for enabling a person suffering from a tobacco dependency to reduce his/her tobacco consumption succes¬ sively as opposed to stopping smoking completely.For instance, various methods have been proposed for successively reducing the craving for nicotine.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONTECHNICAL PROBLEMWhen considering the present standpoint of techniques, as described above, it will be seen that a technical problem exists in providing a device which in a first withdrawal stage provides a possibility of overcoming solely the aforesaid movement habits, and also a 

possibility of completely satisfying the desire to smoke and the craving for nicotine.It will also be seen that a technical problem resides in the provision

 CLAIMS
1. A device intended and adapted to be held enclosed in a space defined between the frontal surfaces of the teeth and the inner surfaces of the lips of a user, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the device has a central region within which one or more holes are pro¬ vided; in that the cross-section of said hole or holes is/are adapted so that the airflow drawn therethrough (inhalation) will meet with a resistance that corre¬ sponds to, or essentially corresponds to, the air resis¬ tance which is met by the airflow through a cigarette, a cigar, a pipe or like device.
2. A device according to Claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the perforated central part of said device is comprised of a plastic material or like material; and in that a peripheral part which surrounds said central part either completely or partially is comprised of a saliva-dissolved material.
3. A device according to Claim l or 2, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the central part and the peri¬ pheral part surrounding said central part is comprised either completely or partially of a saliva-dissolved material.
4. A device according to Claim 3, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the peripheral part is made from a material which is more dissolved more readily by saliva than the central part.
5. A device according to Claims 2, 3 or 4, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the saliva-dissolved material has an adapted nicotine content.
