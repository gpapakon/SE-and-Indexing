<ABSTRACT>
Transmission device for a motor vehicle including a primary shaft (7) coaxial with the shaft (5) of the engine (2), a secondary shaft (28) parallel to the primary shaft (7), and a set of gears (26, 27, 31) progressively stepping-down the movement of the primary shaft (7) onto the secondary shaft (28) and onto a differential (11), characterised in that the primary shaft (7) is coupled to the shaft (5) of the engine (2), and in that the set of gears (26, 27, 31) consists of a first gear (26) fixed to the primary shaft (7), of a second gear (27) driven by the first gear (26) and fixed to the secondary shaft (28), and of a third gear (31) fixed to the secondary shaft (28) and meshing with the crown wheel (ring gear) (32) of the differential (11).

A transmission device for an automobile vehicle with no clutch comprising a primary 
shaft (7) coaxial with the shaft (5) of the electric motor (2) of a vehicle and on which 

there is fixed a first pinion (26), a secondary shaft (28), parallel to the primary shaft 
(7), on which there are fixed a second pinion (27), driven by the first pinion (26), and 

a third pinion (31) engaging with the crown gear (32) of a differential (11), 
characterised in that the primary shaft (7) is coupled to the shaft (5) of the motor (2) 

by means of coupling means (6, 40) ensuring the recovery by bending of the axial 
defects of this latter. 
A transmission device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the coupling means 
are formed by a torsion damper (6). 
A transmission device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the damper (6) has 
a damper body (16) rigid with the shaft (5) of the motor (2), a hub (24) rigid with the 

primary shaft (7) and a plurality of damper springs (22). 
A transmission device as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the springs (22) are 
held between two sheets (21) rigid with the damper body (16) and engaged via a disc 

(23) rigid with the hub (24). 
A transmission device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the primary shaft (7) bears a parking wheel (36). 
A transmission device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the coupling means 
(40) are formed by a torsion shaft (40) disposed within the primary shaft (7). 
A transmission device as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the torsion shaft 
(40) is secured by a first end (45) to the shaft (5) of the motor (2) and by a second 

end (42) to the primary shaft (7).  
 
A transmission device as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that the first end (45) of 
the torsion shaft (40) is engaged within first grooves (39), provided in a sleeve (37) 

incorporated on the output shaft (5) of the motor (2) and in that the second end (42) 
of the torsion shaft (40) is engaged in second grooves (41) within the primary shaft 

(7). 
A transmission device as claimed in claims 5 to 8, characterised in that the parking 
wheel (36) is disposed between the first pinion (26) and the end (8) of the primary 

shaft (7) closest to the motor (2).
