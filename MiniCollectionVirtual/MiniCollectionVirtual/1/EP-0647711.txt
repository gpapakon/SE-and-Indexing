<ABSTRACT>
A plant cell transformed with all or part of a 

Bacillus
thuringiensis
 gene coding for either a 130 or 132 
kDa protoxin against Lepidoptera, preferably with a part 

of the gene coding just for the respective 62 or 60 kDa 
trypsin-digestion product of the protoxin. A plant, 

regenerated from the transformed cell, is resistant to 
Lepidoptera.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new DNA sequence ("the
bt4 gene") from the genome of the strain Bacillus
thuringiensis var. aizawai HD-68 (the "Bt HD-68 strain")
which is publicly available from the Agricultural Research
Culture Collection, Northern Region Research Center, 1815
North University Street, Peoria, Illinois 61604, U.S.A. The
bt4 gene encodes a 132 kDa protein (the "Bt4 protoxin")This invention also relates to a 60 kDa protein (the
"Bt4 toxin") which
can be obtained by trypsin digestion of the Bt4 protoxin
The Bt4 toxin is the
active ingredient in the crystallized protoxin produced by
the Bt HD-68 strain, with a high activity against
Lepidoptera species, such as Manduca sexta and Spodoptera
species.As is the case for other B. thuringiensis ("Bt")
crystal proteins (Höfte et al, 1988), when the crystalline
Bt4 protoxin is ingested by insect larvae, it is
solubilized and processed in the insect's midgut, releasing 
the Bt4 toxin . In this regard,
Höfte et al (1988) has generally described three types of
toxin-producing Lepidoptera-specific B. thuringiensis
having the following characteristics:
Type A (consisting of 3 subtypes) producing a protoxin
of 130 kDa and a toxin of 60 kDa which is toxic against
Manduca sexta and Pieris brassicae.Type B producing a protoxin of 133 kDa and a 55 kDa
toxin which is toxic against Pieris brassicae.Type C producing a 135 kDa protoxin and a 63 kDa
trypsin-activated toxin, showing insecticidal activity
against Spodoptera littoralis and Mamestra brassicae.This invention further relates to a chimaeric gene that
can be used to transform a plant cell and that contains the
following, operably linked, DNA sequences:
1) all or an insecticidally effective part of the bt4
gene encoding all or an insecticidally effective
part of the respective Bt4 protoxin, preferably
a truncated part of the bt4 gene ("the
truncated bt4 gene") encoding just the
respective Bt4 toxin;2) a promoter suitable to direct transcription of all or
part of the bt4 gene in the plant cell; and3) suitable 3' transcription regulation signals for
expressing all or part of the bt4 gene in the
plant cell.
This chimaeric gene is hereinafter referred to as the "bt4
chimaeric gene". Preferably, the plant cell is
transformed with a bt4 chimaeric gene comprising
the truncated bt4 gene, together with a selectable
marker gene, such as the neo gene encoding neomycin
phosphotransferase II or NPTII (Reiss et al, 1984), fused
with the truncated bt4 gene as a bt4-neo
hybrid gene encoding a Bt4 toxin - NPTII 
fusion
