<ABSTRACT>
A disposable plastic laryngoscope blade (10) is detachably 
connectable to a hook-on-type conventional metallic 

laryngoscope handle (12) in conformity with International 
Standard ISO-7376-1. The blade comprises a rigid plastic 

housing (14) having a lower, tongue-engaging flange section (16) 
extending along the length thereof, an upper, teeth-engaging 

flange section (18), and web sections (20,22) interconnecting the upper 
and lower flanges to form a hollow cavity (24); an electric bulb(26) 

having a rating of about 2 to about 2.5 Volts and about 0.35 
to about 0.5 Amperes, positioned within the cavity adjacent 

the distal end of the blade and having positive (30) and negative (32) 
electrode conductors extending therefrom; a proximal base 

end (34) provided with hooks (36) or fittings for engaging 
complementary handle hooks or fittings in compliance with 

ISO-7376-1, the proximal base being provided with a positive 
central contact (47) positioned to press against a standard 

insulated central contact (48) provided in the handle when 
attached thereto, and elevating into an operating position 

to maintain conductivity from a power source in the handle 
and ensure illumination of the bulb while in the engaged 

operating position; a first current-conducting means 
connecting the positive electrode conductor to the positive 

central contact (62) and a second current-conducting means (64) 
connecting the negative electric conductor with a metallic 

surface of the handle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laryngoscopes. More
particularly, the present invention relates to disposable
plastic laryngoscope blades.As is known and explained, e.g., in U.S. Patent
3,766,909, a laryngoscope is a type of device for assisting
in the observation of the oral cavity, particularly the
laryngeal areas. This device is frequently employed by an
anesthesiologist to aid in the placement of a tube into the
larynx of a patient for the passage of anesthetising gas.
In order to obtain accurate placement, the instrument must
be capable of restraining the patient's tongue, while
engaging the epiglottis to reveal the larynx for visual
observation. The laryngoscope is also useful for general
examination of the larynx. These functions are greatly
aided by the use of a light source in association with the
laryngoscope blade to produce localized illumination within
the area to be examined.Furthermore, as known and explained, e.g., in U.S.
Patent 4,557,256, laryngoscopes generally comprise a blade
and a cooperating handle, which are connected together in a
generally L-shaped configuration. The handle normally
serves as an enclosure for one or more batteries which
energize a light bulb secured adjacent to the blade and
connected by wires or other electrical conducting means to
the batteries in the handle. The switch for activating the
light is usually positioned immediately adjacent to the
light bulb and is operated by the blade when it is connected
onto the handle. The light from the bulb passes through a
clear light conductor to the distal end of the blade, to 
illuminate the patient's mouth and larynx during the
examination thereof by medical personnel. The surface of
the blade adjacent to the handle is used to press against
the tongue and mandible of a patient in a supine position,
in order to prevent the patient's tongue from obstructing
the visual examination of the larynx.While the instrument is useful for examining the
larynx, the primary function of the laryngoscope is to
expose the larynx in order to facilitate the insertion of an
endotracheal tube. The surface of the laryngoscope blade
adjacent the handle is urged against the tongue and mandible
to expose the larynx in such procedures, and the opposite
blade surface is positioned opposing the upper front teeth
of the patient.As more fully explained, e.g., in U.S. Patent
4,878,486, when anesthetized, the human body tends to
function somewhat irregularly. For instance, the air
passageway may close up, and stomach acid may enter the
lungs. To

A disposable plastic laryngoscope blade (10), detachably connectable to a hook-on-type
conventional metallic laryngoscope handle (12) in conformity with International Standard

ISO-7376-1; said blade comprising:

a rigid plastic housing (14) having a lower, tongue-engaging flange section (16)
extending along the length thereof, an upper, teeth-engaging flange section (18), and web

sections (20,22) interconnecting the upper and lower flanges to form a hollow cavity (24);
an electric bulb (26) having a rating of about 2 to about 2.5 Volts and about 0.35 to
about 0.5 Amperes, positioned within said cavity adjacent the distal end (28) of said blade

and having positive and negative electrode conductors (30,32) extending therefrom; and
a proximal base end (34) provided with hooks or fittings (36) for engaging
complementary handle hooks or fittings (38) in compliance with ISO-7376-1,
said proximal base being provided with
a negative current-conducting means (46) and

a positive current-conducting means (47)
positioned to press against a positive central contact (48) provided in said handle when
