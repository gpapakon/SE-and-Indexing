<ABSTRACT>
A sterile one-piece suture clip having a first clamping 
member (4) having a distal end, a first proximal end and a 

first clamping surface (20), a second clamping member (14) having 
a second proximal end, a second clamping surface (22), and a 

locking surface and being pivotally connected at said 
second proximal end by a hinge (12) to said first proximal 

end of the first clamping member,a plurality of leg 
members (10,11) each having an inner surface, a side surface and 

an end, said legs being disposed in sets comprising U-shaped 
members in combination with the first clamping 

surface, the inner surface (6) of each leg in the set facing 
the opposite leg thereof, said inner surface being 

beveled from the end of the leg toward the first 
clamping surface to form ears, said U-shaped members 

being attached to the first clamping member, said side 
surface of said legs being beveled from the end of the 

leg toward the first clamping member thereby forming a 
channel (19) said first clamping member being adapted to be 

placed on a suture to be clipped, said channel being 
adapted to orient a suture transversely across said 

first clamping surface and said second clamping member 
being sized and configured to pivot about said hinge, 

extend between and fit within each of said U-shaped 
members, be held in place by said ears engaging said 

locking surface thereby engaging a suture between said 
first and second clamping surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical clip. More 
particularly, it relates to a clip suitably adapted to 
replace a suture knot during endoscopic surgery. One of the truly great advances in recent years to 
reduce the invasiveness of surgical procedures is 
endoscopic surgery. Endoscopic surgery involves the use 
of an endoscope which is an instrument permitting the 
visual inspection and magnification of any cavity of the 
body. The endoscope is inserted through a cannula after 
puncture through the wall of the body cavity with a 
trocar, which is a sharp-pointed instrument. The 
surgeon can then perform diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures at the surgical site with the aid of 
specialized instrumentation designed to fit through 
additional cannulas providing small diameter openings 
into the desired body cavity as may be required. An age-old procedure which surgeons are required to 
perform to repair or reconstruct traumatized bodily 
tissue is suturing. Fortunately, medical instruments 
have been recently designed to allow a surgeon to 
manipulate a suture, or suture and needle combination, 
through the small diameter opening of a cannula. 
However, the ability to accurately place and securely 
tie a suture knot had become troublesome and 
problematical.  Therefore, in response to this problem, surgeons have 
sought alternatives to conventional knot-tying 
techniques which would be suitable during endoscopic 
surgery. Among these alternatives include the use of 
hemostatic clips, which are designed to ligate blood 
vessels and other tubular members, to replace suture 
knots. Such hemostatic clips are described, for 
example, in U.S. Pat Nos. 4,418,694 and 4,476,865. 
These clips can be readily applied with a clip applier 
which is designed to function through the small opening 
of a cannula. Unfortunately, the force required to 
displace these clips from a suture is too low to provide 
a secure knot. As a result, hemostatic clips of the 
type shown in the art are unsuitable for use as 
endoscopic knot clips. In view of the deficiencies of the prior art for 
creating a useful alternative to tying a suture knot, 
what is desired within the medical community is a device 
suitable for application using endoscopic techniques 
which can successfully replace the suture knot. More 
specifically, what is needed is a clip particularly 
adapted for replacing a suture knot during endoscopic 
surgery, and which exhibits adequate clamping force to 
function effectively. The present invention provides a

<CLAIMS>
A sterile one-piece suture clip comprising: 
   a first clamping member having a distal end, a 

first proximal end and a first clamping 
surface; 

   a second clamping member having a second 
proximal end, a second clamping surface, and a 

locking surface and being pivotally connected 
at said second proximal end by a hinge to said 

first proximal end of the first clamping 
member; 

   a plurality of leg members each having an 
inner surface, a side surface and an end, said 

legs being disposed in sets comprising U-shaped 
members in combination with the first 

clamping surface, the inner surface of each 
leg in the set facing the inner surface of the 

opposite leg thereof, said inner surface being 
beveled from the end of the leg toward the 

first clamping surface to form ears, said U-shaped 
members being attached to the first 

clamping member, said side surface of said 
legs being beveled from the end of the leg 

toward the first clamping member thereby 
forming a channel; 

   said first clamping member being adapted to be 
placed on a suture to be clipped, said channel 

being adapted to orient a suture transversely 
across said first clamping surface and said 

second clamping member being sized and 
 

configured to pivot about said hinge, extend 
between and fit within each of said U-shaped 

members, be held in place by said ears 
engaging said locking surface thereby engaging 

a suture between said first and second 
clamping surfaces. 
The clip of claim 1 wherein the second 
clamping surface of said second clamping 

member has a convex radius of curvature 
extending transversely across substantially 

the entire width of said second clamping 
member, the first clamping surface of said 

first clamping member has a concave radius of 
curvature extending transversely across 

substantially the entire width of said first 
clamping member, the radius of curvature of 

the second clamping surface of said second 
clamping member being smaller than the radius 

of curvature of the first clamping surface of 
said first clamping member, said first and second 

clamping members being complementary so that when the 
clip is in a clamped position, the clamping surfaces 

of said first and second clamping members are in 
substantially complete contacting relationship so 

as to minimize the gap which is created between 
said surfaces. 
The clip of claim 2 wherein said radii of 
curvature of the clamping surfaces of said 

first and second clamping members are uniform. 
The clip of claim 1 wherein the clamping surfaces 
are textured.
