<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to security
systems in particular, but not exclusively, for use in
motor vehicles.Motor vehicles equipped with alarm systems, when
armed, operate an audible alarm when a third party
attempts unauthorised access to the vehicle.Such systems are armed or disarmed by
transmitting a coded radio, ultrasonic or infrared signal
from a pocket sized transmitter to a receiver in the car.
The receiver in the car checks or validates the code and
provided the code corresponds to the correct code stored
in the receiver, an appropriate arm/disarm circuit is
activated.With increasing levels of sophistication amongst
car thieves, such systems have become increasingly
vulnerable. In particular thieves have been known to
provide a transmitter which sequentially transmits each of
the many thousands (around 64,000) possible codes in turn.
By leaving the transmitter in the vicinity of the targeted
vehicle for a period of say two to three hours, it is
almost inevitable that the code associated with the
targeted vehicle will eventually be transmitted whereupon
the alarm system will be disarmed thereby enabling the
thief to return and steal the vehicle using more
traditional techniques.Another technique employed by thieves is to
monitor the area in the vicinity of the car for any
transmissions by the driver to arm or disarm the car.
Such transmissions are digitally stored and when the car
is left unattended the stored signal is reproduced and
transmitted to again disarm the car.European Patent Specification No EP-A-0 265 728
discloses a security system having a transmitter and a
receiver for receiving signals transmitted from the 
transmitter. The transmitter and receiver each have a
control unit producing the same predetermined clock
frequencies and encoders for producing, generally in
synchronism, a sequence of different codes. The receiver
has a comparator for comparing the locally generated codes
with those received, and generating a trigger output
signal when equality is detected. The receiver and
transmitter each have means for effecting an initial
synchronisation between the control units and encoders of
the transmitter and the receiver.Successive codes generated by the transmitter
follow a predetermined pattern irrespective of any delay
between the transmission of successive codes.It is an object of the invention to provide an
improved security system in which the successive codes
generated will be different for different delays between
successive transmissions.According to the present
