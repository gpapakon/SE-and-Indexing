<ABSTRACT>
A tube fitting is comprised of a tubular body (1), an annular 
clamping member (2), a tubular inner pipe (9), a releasing member (70), 

and 
a sealing ring (5). The clamping member is disposed axially 

movably in an axial bore (1A) of the body, and includes a claw (2A) and 
an outer peripheral portion (2E). The claw has an inclined surface 

projecting in a centripetal direction as an opening of the body 
goes away, and engages with an outer peripheral surface of a 

tube (8) fitted into the axial bore via the opening. The outer 
peripheral portion contacts with a regulatory surface (3A) of the 

body, and is pressed in a centripetal direction thereby, and 
accordingly presses the claw onto the outer peripheral surface 

of the tube. The inner pipe is disposed in the tube coaxially 
with an inner peripheral surface of the tube at an end of the 

tube. The releasing member includes a tubular base (7) and a 
leading end (4). The base is disposed axially movably in the axial 

bore on an outer side with respect to the regulatory surface. 
The leading end extends from the base over the regulatory 

surface to an inner side of the axial bore, and goes between 
the inclined surface of the claw and the outer peripheral 

surface of the tube. The sealing ring seals between an inner 
peripheral surface (10C) of the axial bore and an outer peripheral 

surface of the tube fixed in the axial bore.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tube fitting, and it
particularly relates to a tube fitting which can be connected
with a soft or semi-hard tube without causing leakage.Figures 23 and 24, show as a matter of principle tube
fittings which are designed to be connected
with a soft or semi-hard tube, for example a resin tube. The
tube fitting illustrated in Figure 23 comprises a tubular body
110, an annular clamping member 120, a releasing member 130,
and a sealing ring 140. The body 110 includes a regulatory
surface 112 on the inner peripheral surface, regulatory surface
112 which extends in the centripetal direction as an end
opening 111 comes near, and an axial bore 113 into which a tube
150 is fitted via the opening 111. The clamping member 120 is
disposed slidably in the axial direction on an inner side with
respect to the regulatory surface 112 in the axial bore 113.
The clamping member 120 includes a plurality of arms 125 which
extend from a tubular end portion 124 in the axial direction, a 
claw 122 disposed at the free end of the arms 125, and an outer
peripheral portion 123, and it is formed in an annular shape.
The claw 122 has an inclined surface 121 which projects in the
centripetal direction as the opening 111 goes away and which
engages with an outer peripheral surface of the tube 150 fitted
into the axial bore 113 via the opening 111. The outer
peripheral portion 123 contacts with the regulatory surface 112
of the body 110, and thereby it is pressed in the centripetal
direction by the regulatory surface 112 so as to press the claw
122 onto the outer peripheral surface of the tube 150. The
releasing member 130 includes a tubular base 131 and a leading
end 132. The tubular base 131 is disposed slidably in the
axial direction of the axial bore 113 on the side of the
opening 111. The sealing ring 140 is an 0-ring made from
r-ubber, and it is disposed between the base 131 and the leading
end 132 of the releasing member 130.In this conventional tube fitting, the tube 150 is fitted
into the axial bore 131 via the opening 111, and it is pulled
back later. Then, the outer peripheral portion 123 of the
clamping member 120 is brought into contact with the regulatory
surface 112 disposed in the axial bore 113 of the body 110, and
it is pressed in the centripetal direction. Thus, the claw 122
is pressed onto the outer peripheral surface of the tube 150,
and it pinches and engages with the outer peripheral surface of
the tube 150. By the engagement between the claw 122 and the 
tube 150, the tube 150
