<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synergistic composition comprising a combination of
herbicidally active substances which is suitable for selective weed control in crops of
useful plants, for example in crops of cereals, sorghum and rice, but in particular in crops
of maize.The invention also relates to a process and to the use of this novel composition for
controlling weeds in the stated crops.N-[2-(3,3,3-Trifluoropropyl)-phenylsulfonyl]-N'-(4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-urea
of the formula I

and agrochemically tolerated salts thereof have proved to be selective herbicides against
weeds in crops.The compound of the formula I and the preparation thereof are described in US-A-4 671
819.Similarly, the following compounds are known selective herbicides and some of them are
commercially available:
