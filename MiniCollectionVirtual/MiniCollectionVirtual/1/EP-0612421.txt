<CLAIMS>
Stored-program control having at least one 
instruction memory (BS), which is connected by way of 

at least one bus system (DB) to a word processor (WP) 
and a bit processor (BP) of the control and stores 

instructions for the operation of the stored-program 
control, with the word processor (WP) being provided 

for the word processing operation and the bit processor 
(BP) being provided for the bit processing operation, 

characterised in that 

the bit processor (BP) has at least two flag 
registers (FL1, FL2), of which the first (FL1) 

stores the binary combination result of a binary 
processing operation and the second (FL2) stores 

this combination result in case the bit processor 
(BP) or word processor (WP) processes a first 

instruction which is provided therefor and is 
stored in the instruction memory (BS); and in that 
the bit processor (BP) or word processor (WP) 
reads out the second flag register (FL2) with a 

second instruction which is stored in the 
instruction memory (BS) and processes the 

combination result of the binary processing 
operation. 
Stored-program control according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the first instruction is a first 

binary combination instruction (UE1.0, UE2.0) which is 
to be processed by the bit processor (BP). 
Stored-program control according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the first instruction is a memory 

instruction which is to be processed by the word 
processor (WP). 
Stored-program control according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the first instruction is a jump 

instruction which is to be processed by the word 
processor (WP).  

 
Stored-program control according to one of the 

claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the second 
instruction is a second combination instruction (UFL2) 

which is to be processed by the bit processor (BP). 
Stored-program control according to one of the 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the second 

instruction is a second binary combination instruction 
which is to be processed by the word processor (WP).
