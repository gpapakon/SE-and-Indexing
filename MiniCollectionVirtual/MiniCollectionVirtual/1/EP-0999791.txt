<ABSTRACT>
Retractor system to be used in surgery, and with separate parts in combination, comprising an assistance nipple (10) with a base plate (12) and an adhesive patch (14) underneath, for attachment to the patient's skin, or on a surgical sheet (30) to the nipple (10), for fastening of a retractor (22) for retracting outwardly and fastening of the edges of an incision. In the combined system is also comprised an assistance ring (18) with a number of attached, peripherally placed assistance nipples (20) which, prior to surgery, are placed underneath the surgical sheet (30) and across an opening in the adhesive patch (32), so that the nipples on the assistance ring point upward through holes in the surgical sheet, and retractors (22) can be fastened to the nipples (20) for outwardly retraction and fastening of the edges of an incision.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RETRACTOR SYSTEM USED INSURGICAL OPERATIONSThe invention concerns a system for combined use of retractors and surgical sheets used for keeping a field of surgery in clear view during surgery in process. Thus, the invention concerns a system of the above-mentioned kind, comprising also an assistance nibble and an assistance ring, with a number of nipples for fastening of retractors in the decided position.It is known, for instance during abdominal surgery, to use retractors which retract the edges of an incision apart, keeping them separated, so that the field of surgery is accessible and with unimpaired view. Previously, retractors where kept manually in desired position by surgeon assistants who also had to attend when the surgeon requested adjustment of the retractors' position. Use of retractors was therefore akward, partially strenuous and time-consuming as well as costly, due to the need for participating assistants. When used for long periods of time, it was also difficult to keep the retractors constantly in the desired position, due to variations in tension, and due to fatigue in the assistant(s).In order to simplify the use of retractors, and decrease the need for participation from assistants, it has previously been suggested various devices for non-manual fastening of retractors and for adjustment of their position. However, it is common for all known devices that they are costly, and with complicated construction, and that they usually require two hands for 

positioning on a patient, and for being adjusted into position. It is also a drawback that these devices unintentionally may be brought out of position, and thus inflicting complications in ongoing surgery.US-patent 2493598 concerns a canvas mat to be positioned over a patient's abdomen, with a relatively wide, circular opening, covering the operation area. Along the mat's longitudinal edges are straps for fastening to the lower edges of the operation table. A number of peripherally positioned retractors alongside the mat's central opening may be strapped to the opening's reinforced inner edge. The device shows none of the characteristic steps in the present invention.US-patent 3998217 describes a flat, ring-shaped frame with four outwardly pointing peripheral support flanges, each having two fixed pegs for insertion into retractor shaft holes, through which each of four retractors may by locked in the desired position. The device is markedly different from the present invention, in which is included also retractors made from special

CLAIM
Retractor system for use in surgery, c h f U C t e i z Î² d i n a combination of single parts preferably made by non conductive, impact, acid and heat resistant special plastic, comprising an assistance nipple (10) made from one piece, with a plate underneath (12), having an adhesive patch (14) at its lower surface for fastening to the skin of a patient or on a surgical sheet, a retractor (22) with a gripping part (24) and a shaft (26) with a number of holes (28), for outwardly retracting of edges of an incision and fastening in this position by the nipple (10) being brought into encroachment with one of the shaft holes (28), as the retractor's position may be adjusted by detaching the assistance nipple (10) from the retractor's shaft and being inserted into another shaft hole (28), an assistance ring (18) with mounted, peripheral and evenly distributed assistance nipples (20) which my be brought into and out of encroachment with the retractor's shafts hole (28) for retracting and fastening of edges of an incision, and surgical sheet (30) with an opening and an underlying adhesive patch (32), also having an opening corresponding to the assistance ring's opening, with the adhesive patch, in preparation of surgery, is fasten to the patient's skin with the opening over and around the field of operation, and the assistance ring (18) being placed over the opening of the adhesive patch and below the opening of the surgical sheet, with the assistance nipple (20) protruding upwardly through the holes 


around the surgical sheet's opening, ready for insertion into the shaft hole (28) on retractor's (22), for retracting and fastening of edges of an incision, where the combined single parts are arranged for being operated by use of one hand only.
