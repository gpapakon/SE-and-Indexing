<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to longitudinal cutting of fish fillet pieces substantially parallel with the skin side (S) of the original fillet. This cutting in layers or slices takes place in that the fish fillet (F, F1) is brought into contact with a rotating cooled freezing drum (7, 7') which freezes the fillet (F2) at the skin side (S) and conveys it in retained position against the operative cutting edge of a driven, endless band knife (18). During the rotation of the drum (7, 7'), the operative cutting edge of the band knife (18) is displaced stepwise in relation to the drum circumference between two successive revolutions of the drum (7, 7'), in order to cut a fish meat slice (FS) successively for each drum revolution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for cutting slices
from fish fillets with the skin still on, wherein the fillet
is fed toward a freezing drum causing freezing and anchoring
of the fillet at the skin side, whereby the longitudinal
direction of the fillet preferably is orientated in the
circumferential direction of the drum, and wherein a cutting
tool, preferably in the form of a driven endless band knife,
is positioned with the operative cutting edge thereof at a
(radial) distance from the drum mantle surface, and wherein,
from the fillet adhering to the drum through freezing, a
fish meat slice is cut, the cutting plane extending
substantially parallel with the drum circumference.Methods and machines adapted to cut the skin from the
fillets are known, wherein a rotating freezing drum is utilized,
i.e. a drum being frozen down to beneath the
freezing point. When wet fillets with the skin side thereof
come into contact with the rotating freezing drum, they
become frozen to the circumferential surface of the drum,
where they are kept securely in place while being conducted
toward a cutting device in the form of a band knife which
cuts the fillet free from the skin, and wherein the skin is
scraped off from the drum by means of a scraper means
following the band knife and permanently contacting the drum
surface. This known method and machine are well suited for 
skinning (flaying) fish fillets, but they are not suitable
for cutting a boneless fillet slice at the skinless fillet
side, and the stationary scraper means renders it impossible
to divide a fillet into several parallel slices, each
extending substantially parallel with the skin side.Norwegian patent specification No. 54 801 discloses methods
and devices for anchoring fish fillets upon the removal of
the skin or other treatment. According to this patent
specification, it is likewise used a retaining surface
operating through freezing and which, thus, freezes the
fillet during the skin removal or other treatment,
whereafter the freezing of the fish fillet is neutralized
through thawing. In rational fillet treatment, thawing is a
too slow process.Norwegian patent specification No. 109 486 discloses an
apparatus for treating fish, comprising a conveyor movable
along a closed path and having the form of a freezing
surface retaining the fish through freezing during the
treatment, the fish in frozen position being conveyed past a
stationarily placed treating tool. The movable freezing
conveyor consists of a freezing drum assigned a scraper
means

<CLAIMS>
A method for cutting slices (FS) from fish fillets
(F, F1, F2) with the skin (S) still on, wherein the fillet

(F, F1) is fed toward a freezing drum (7, 7') causing
the fillet (F2) to be frozen and retained thereto at the

skin side (S), the longitudinal direction of the fillet
preferably being orientated in the circumferential direction

of the drum (7, 7'), and wherein a cutting tool,
preferably in the form of a driven endless band knife

(18), is positioned at a radial distance from the mantle
face (7') of the drum, and wherein, from the fillet (F2)

adhering to the drum through freezing, a fish meat slice
(FS) is cut, the division plane thereof during the cutting-off

operation extending substantially parallel with the
drum circumference, 
characterized in

that one, during the rotation of the drum (7, 7') with
fillet respectively fillets (F2) frozen thereto at the

skin side (S), displaces said cutting tool's (18) operative
cutting edge stepwise in relation to the drum circumference

between each revolution of the drum (7, 7')
with retained fillet(s) (F2), in order to successively

cut further fish meat slices (FS) parallel with the
first one, i.e. parallel with the two main faces of the

original fillet (F, F1), one slice for each drum revolution. 
A machine for the accomplishment of the method as
set forth in claim 1,

comprising an insertion place (2) for
fish fillet (F), an endless conveyor (3) connected

thereto and conducting fillet to a freezing drum (7, 7')
adapted to be frozen to a temperature beneath the freezing

point and equipped with a cutting tool in the form
of a driven endless band knife (18), the operative cutting

edge thereof being radially spaced from the drum's
mantle face (7'),


characterized in

that the suspension frame (25, 27)
of the band knife (18) is pivotally suspended around a

horizontal axis (26) on a bracket (24) rigidly attached
to the machine frame, and that said suspension frame

(25, 27) is operatively connected to an adjusting device
(28) adapted to change the swinging position of the band

knife frame (25, 27) in the vertical plane stepwise
around said horizontal axis (26), the effective distance

between the operative cutting edge of the band knife (18)
and the drum mantle face (7') being changed stepwise

between each revolution of the freezing drum (7, 7').
A machine as set forth in claim 2, 
characterized
in
 that the freezing drum (7, 7') is
assigned scraper means in order to release the drum

mantle face (7') from skin and other waste (31), and
that said scraper means (20, 21), respectively each

scraper means of a plurality of such means (20, 21),
following each other in the circumferential direction

of the drum (7, 7'), is displaceably disposed in relation
to the drum circumference (7'), between an operative

scraping position and an inoperative position, wherein
the one or more scraper means (20, 21) are withdrawn

outside a circle path described by the fillets (F2)
frozen to the drum surface (7'), during several successive

revolutions of the drum. 
A machine as set forth in claim 3, 
characterized
in
 that the endless conveyor consists of
a conveying belt (3) laid around two end rollers (5, 6),

namely a downstream drive roller (6) in relation to the
rotatable freezing drum (7, 7') and an upstream turning

roller (5) in relation to the same, and that the conveyor
belt's (3) uppermost conveying portion, over an

area (3'') beneath the freezing drum (7, 7') extending
from a point immediately in front of the freezing drum

(7, 7') to a point immediately behind the same, has a
deflected course wherein the uppermost portion moves

elastically compliant vertically, in order to favour
the delivery of the fillet (F1) to the drum.
A machine as set forth in claim 4, 
characterized
in
 that the upper portion of the conveying
belt (3), at each end of said fillet delivery area (3''),

as measured in the upper belt portion's (3) direction of
motion, is assigned an underlying support roller (22, 23).
A machine as set forth in one or more of claims 3 to 5,

characterized in
 that the freezing drum
(7, 7') upstream is assigned a fillet-supply-restricting

flap (19) which is rotatable around a horizontal axis
between an operative, swung-down closing position wherein

it blocks the admission path for fish fillet (F)

and an inoperative, swung-up position wherein said admission
path is open.
